BACKGROUND
nac genes that encode plant-specific transcription factors influence a diverse set of developmental processes. the nac family proteins contain a consensus sequence known as the nac domain   <cit> , which is located in the n-terminal region, but their c-terminal sequences are divergent in both length and amino acid sequence  <cit> . nac proteins make up a large family, with a total of  <dig> and  <dig> predicted proteins identified in arabidopsis and rice, respectively  <cit> . members of the nac family seem to play different roles in plant development. for example, nam from petunia  <cit>  and cuc <dig> of arabidopsis <cit>   are involved in shoot apical meristem  development. by contrast, the arabidopsis nac gene cuc <dig> has been reported to contribute to the establishment of the cotyledon boundary and the shoot meristem  <cit> . another arabidopsis nac gene called nap  has been characterized as the target of two mads box genes, apetal <dig> and pistillata, which control cell division and cell expansion in stamens and petals  <cit> . atnac <dig> has been characterized as an intermediary in the auxin-signaling pathway that activates genes encoding molecules involved in the specification of lateral root initiation  <cit> . in addition, nac proteins have been implicated in defense and abiotic stress responses. some ataf subfamily genes, including stnac from tomato and ataf1- <dig> from arabidopsis, have been shown to be induced by pathogen attack and wounding  <cit> . more recently, some nac genes such as bnnac from brassica <cit> , atnac <dig> , atnac <dig> and atnac <dig> from arabidopsis <cit> , and snac <dig> <cit>  and snac <dig> <cit>  from rice were found to be involved in the plant's response to various environmental stresses, including drought, salinity, and/or low temperature.

micrornas  are a class of small, non-coding rnas that regulate gene expression by guiding target mrna cleavage or translational inhibition  <cit> . in arabidopsis, mir <dig> can target five nac domain-encoding mrnas, including the nac <dig>  cuc <dig>  cuc <dig>  at5g <dig>  and at5g <dig> mrnas  <cit> . nac <dig> is able to transmit auxin signals that promote lateral root emergence, and mir <dig> guides the cleavage of nac <dig> mrna, which is followed by a mechanism to cleave nac <dig> mrna and downregulate auxin signals  <cit> . other groups have independently reported evidence for the mir164-mediated regulation of cuc <dig> <cit>  and cuc <dig> <cit> , which have been implicated in meristem development and the separation of aerial organs.

the process of lateral root  development has been extensively studied in flowering plants and gymnosperms, and lrs begin in a specialized cell layer  in the primary root   <cit> . in arabidopsis and most other dicots, lrs are only formed from the pericycle cells that overlay the developing xylem tissue . in other species, particularly cereals such as maize, rice and wheat, lrs arise specifically from the phloem pole pericycle, with additional contributions from the endodermis  <cit> . in arabidopsis, a large body of evidence has indicated that auxin plays a pivotal role in lateral root development. lateral root initiation begins with auxin-induced iaa <dig> degradation. this step allows the activation of arf <dig> and arf <dig> transcription factors, which then activate the expression of lbd/asl genes. the lbd/asl proteins in turn activate cell cycle genes and cell patterning genes, allowing the formation of a new lateral root primordium   <cit> . in addition, auxin activates the transcription of nac <dig>  which upregulates the expression of two downstream auxin-responsive genes including dbp and air <dig> to stimulate lr initiation  <cit> . the post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation of nac <dig> was also reported as follows: the role of mir <dig> expression in late auxin response was intended to clear nac <dig> mrna, which would attenuate the auxin signaling that inhibits lateral root development  <cit> . a ring-finger ubiquitin e <dig> ligase called sinat <dig> promoted nac <dig> ubiquitination and its subsequent degradation in order to attenuate the auxin response  <cit> .

in this study, a mir164-targeted nac domain gene that was designated zmnac <dig> was isolated from maize. it was demonstrated that zmnac <dig> overexpression in arabidopsis leads to increased number of lateral roots. further study showed that mir <dig> is one of the trans-acting factors that negatively regulates zmnac <dig>  resulting in a different zmnac <dig> expression pattern between the two inbred lines 87- <dig> and zong <dig>  contributing to a significant difference in the lateral root phenotype between these two lines. moreover, our analysis also indicated that the promoter variation of maize pri-mir164b in 87- <dig> and zong <dig> might be one in which the dominant cis-element affects the expression of pri-mir164b, leading to differences in mature mir <dig> expression.

RESULTS
identification of putative mir164-regulated nac genes in maize
putative nac proteins in maize were identified using the conserved nac domain sequences in a query that was performed by tblastn search. predicted amino acid sequences of the full-length maize cdna  were used for the analysis. in this study, a total of  <dig> putative maize nac proteins were obtained, and  <dig> nacs from arabidopsis were used to construct the polygenetic tree. these nac proteins could be classified into  <dig> groups and  <dig> subgroups on the basis of their predicted nac domain amino acid sequences . it has been reported that mir <dig> directs the regulation of  <dig> target nac-domain transcription factor mrnas in arabidopsis <cit> . to obtain putative mirna-regulated nac genes from maize, we searched the reverse complementary site for the mature mir <dig> in the  <dig> zmnacs. maize mir <dig> sequences were identified in http://www.mirbase.org/. seven zmnac genes, tc <dig>  zm <dig>  zm <dig>  zm <dig>  zm <dig>  zm <dig> and zm <dig>  were found to be putative mir <dig> target genes , and are shown in pink dots in supplemental figure  <dig> . among these genes, the amino acid sequence corresponding to three of them, zm <dig>  tc <dig> and zm <dig>  showed high homology to arabidopsis nac <dig> protein .

expression of putative mir164-regulated zmnac genes
to assay the expression patterns of seven maize nac genes  containing the mir <dig> complementary site, six maize tissues from the roots, leaves, leaf sheaths, male spikes, ears and stems were used for real-time pcr. because these genes showed a high degree of sequence conservation in the nac domain, specific pcr primers were designed for the c-terminal region. the results indicated that tc <dig> and zm <dig> had higher expression levels in their roots than in other analyzed tissues, whereas zm <dig> and zm <dig> showed a lower expression level in the ears and stems than in other analyzed tissues . zm <dig> and zm <dig> accumulated in all organs and developmental stages . it has recently been proposed that mir <dig> guides the cleavage of nac mrnas in arabidopsis <cit> . an rna gel blot of maize mirna <dig> showed that the mir <dig> expression levels were higher in roots, leaf sheaths and male spikes than in other organs . this pattern was similar to the pattern of mir <dig> expression in arabidopsis, where mir <dig> accumulated more in its roots and inflorescences than in other tissues  <cit> . the higher mir <dig> expression in roots suggested that mir <dig> might target the nac gene in roots in vivo.


the zmnac <dig> gene and its expression in maize roots
in arabidopsis, mir <dig> directs nac <dig> mrna cleavage, which affects lateral root development  <cit> . we first sought to identify the putative mir164-targeted nac genes in maize, which might be involved in lateral root development. among the seven candidate mir <dig> target genes, tc <dig> encoded a protein of  <dig> amino acids and shared a high homology with arabidopsis nac <dig>  so we named this gene zmnac <dig>  the full-length  <dig> bp cdna of zmnac <dig> was obtained by using rapid amplification of cdna ends . the n-terminal residues contained the five conserved homologous blocks that characterize the nac family. the divergent c-terminus displayed no homology to other known proteins. our analysis detected a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal sequence  between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> . based on the published maize genome sequences, zmnac <dig> was mapped on chromosome  <dig> and has two introns within its coding region .


arabidopsis nac <dig> has been shown to play an important role in lateral root development. to determine the putative biological function of zmnac <dig> in maize root development, the inbred lines 87- <dig> and zong <dig> along with a set of ril  were used, and in this population, either two inbreeds or the rils showed a significant difference in their lateral root density. the lateral root density of 87- <dig> and zong <dig> were  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively  and a large amplitude of variation in lateral root density  was observed among the rils .

the accumulation of zmnac <dig> transcripts in roots among the inbred lines zong <dig>  87- <dig> and their rils was determined by real-time pcr, which revealed that zmnac <dig> showed  <dig> -fold  higher expression in zong <dig> than in 87- <dig>  and had different expression levels among different ril lines with a maximum of  <dig> -fold higher than zong <dig> and  <dig> -fold lower than 87- <dig> . to determine whether the lateral root phenotypes in ril populations were associated with zmnac <dig> expression level, the correlation coefficient between the lateral root density and the expression levels of zmnac <dig> was calculated. these results showed that the correlation coefficient value reached  <dig>  , suggesting that differential zmnac <dig> expression contributed  <dig> % to the lateral root phenotype. based on these results, we argued that zmnac <dig> played important roles in maize lateral root development and contributes to the lateral root number difference between the inbred lines zong <dig> and 87- <dig> 

overexpression of zmnac <dig> in arabidopsis positively regulated lateral root development
to further confirm the biological function of zmnac <dig>  we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants that overexpressed the zmnac <dig> gene. the transgenic plants with 35s: zmnac <dig> had a phenotype that displayed earlier and more lateral roots than the wild type. at  <dig> days after germination, the seedlings of 35s: zmnac <dig> transgenic lines  developed lateral roots. at  <dig> days after germination, we measured the number of lateral roots per centimeter of primary root in 35s: zmnac <dig> and wild type plants, and the results showed that the lateral root density in the overexpression line and the wild type reached  <dig> ± <dig>  and  <dig> ± <dig> , respectively, with a significant difference between them  . however, there was no difference in phenotype in the growth of the above-ground portion between the wild type and transgenic plants.


zmnac <dig> allelic expression between maize hybrids and parents
gene regulation involves numerous molecular interactions. in general, both cis-regulatory elements and trans-regulatory factors can play important roles. to determine whether the expression of zmnac <dig> is regulated by a cis-, trans-acting or both mechanism, we compared the allele-specific expression of zmnac <dig> in zong <dig>  87- <dig> and their hybrid , which was used as an excellent system to assay allele-specific expression. the two alleles from zong3's female parent and 87- <dig> 's male parent were compared in the hybrid zong3/87- <dig> and were found to be equally affected by genetic background or environmental factors. the allele from zong <dig> had a  <dig> bp insertion in the 5′utr region compared to the allele from 87- <dig>  which made it possible to distinguish the alleles from the two inbred lines and their hybrid; therefore, the parental transcript accumulation in the two inbred lines and the hybrid was examined using allele-specific rt-pcr analysis .


different types of regulatory divergence can be detected experimentally by assaying the allele-specific gene expression in the two parents and the hybrid. when the alleles differ in their expression to the same extent in the parental plants as in the hybrids, then cis-acting genetic differences may be inferred  <cit> . when the alleles differ in their expression to a larger extent in the parental species than in the hybrids, then trans-acting genetic differences may be inferred. the wave dhplc system was used to calculate the p-ratio, which is the ratio of allelic expression in the two parental lines, as well as the h-ratio, which is the ratio of alleles from the two parents in the hybrid. then, we examined whether two zmnac <dig> alleles showed  differential expression in the parents ,  differential expression in the hybrid , or  a difference in the ratio of allelic expression in the parental lines relative to that of the hybrid . our analysis showed that the h-ratio was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   , indicating that there was no difference in cis-regulatory elements between alleles from 87- <dig> and zong <dig>  the p-ratio  was  <dig> ± <dig> , which is significantly different from  <dig>   and unequal to the h ratio  , indicating that there was a change only in the trans-regulatory elements. these findings suggested that the trans-regulatory elements were the dominant mediator of the differential expression of zmnac <dig> between the two zong <dig> and 87- <dig> 


the allelic transcript ratios  of parents and hybrids were compared with an expected ratio indicating an equal allelic expression of  <dig> . the mean, standard error , and p values in the t test were based on three biological replicates. * p <  <dig> .

the allelic transcript ratio  was significantly different from  <dig> , with ** p <  <dig> , whereas the p and h ratios were not significantly different.

mir <dig> as the trans-acting factor that regulates expression of zmnac1
we assessed whether maize mir <dig> is the trans-acting factor that can direct the cleavage of zmnac <dig>  and demonstrated that mir <dig> can direct zmnac <dig> mrna cleavage, by using a modified rna ligase-mediated 5' rapid amplification of cdna ends  protocol. rna sequences with 5' termini corresponding to the center of the mir <dig> complementary site were consistently detected as the product of mirna processing. sequencing analysis of  <dig> independent clones produced identical results and placed the 5' end of the cleaved fragment at nucleotide  <dig> of the zmnac <dig> mrna. this nucleotide position was located in the middle of the mir164/nac mrna complementary region, indicating that zmnac <dig> mrna was the in vivo mir <dig> cleavage target .


we then investigated the expression of mature mir <dig> to determine whether mir <dig>  which can act as the trans-acting regulator of zmnac <dig>  also showed differential expression between 87- <dig> and zong <dig>  northern blot analysis showed that the mature mir <dig> had higher expression levels in 87- <dig> than in zong <dig> , which was the opposite of the zmnac <dig> expression pattern in the two inbred lines.

mir <dig> was potentially transcribed from  <dig> loci, specifically from mir164a to mir164h, in maize. the mature mir <dig> from these loci differed by one or two nucleotides at the 3' end. we designed specific primers to amplify the  <dig> precursors, and only mir164b and mir164d had a higher expression level in the roots than in other tissues. because the oligonucleotide probe used in the rna gel blot cannot discriminate among these eight transcripts, we used gene-specific rt-pcr to analyze pri-mir <dig> expression. the results revealed that pri-mir164b  and pri-mir164d showed  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold higher expression levels in 87- <dig> than in zong <dig> , respectively , suggesting that a higher expression of mir <dig> precursors may contribute to the higher expression of mature mir164s in 87- <dig> 

zmmir164b allelic expression between maize hybrids and parents
the wave hplc system was used to determine whether the differential expression of zmmir <dig> precursors was regulated by a cis-or trans-acting mechanism. first, the full-length cdna of the mir164b and mir164d precursors was obtained by 5′race, and the subsequent sequence analysis indicated that the single transcription start sites for pri-mir164b and pri-mir164d were  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides upstream from the start of the mature mir <dig>  respectively. based on the full-length cdna, the alleles from zong <dig> and 87- <dig> were amplified and sequenced. the zmmir164b allele from zong <dig> contained an  <dig> bp insertion in comparison to that of 87-1; this insert did not have an effect on the formation of the pre-mir <dig> secondary structure . the allelic transcript ratio between the two parents  and in the hybrid  was determined by hplc , and the results showed that the p ratio  and h ratio  could reach up to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively . the p ratio = h ratio ≠  <dig> pattern indicated that a cis-element was involved in the different expression patterns of pri-mir164b transcripts in the two inbred lines. therefore, the sequence difference between the promoters of zmmir164b in zong <dig> and 87- <dig> could be responsible for the differential expression of zmmir164b. for zmmir164d, the two alleles from the two inbred lines only differed at one nucleotide, so we could not detect the allelic expression with the wave dhplc system.


promoters of zm-mir164b from inbred line 87- <dig> showed higher activity
to provide evidence for the cis-regulation of the mir <dig> precursor, we isolated a  <dig>  kb region upstream of the mir164b transcription start site and then determined the activity of the promoters from the two inbred lines 87- <dig> and zong <dig>  sequence analysis revealed that the promoters from these two lines exhibited  <dig> % nucleotide identity for mir164b. based on the sequence polymorphism, specific primers were designed to differentiate the promoters from the two inbred lines.

first, we tested whether zmmir164b showed higher transcription levels in ril plants that contained the promoter from 87- <dig> than ril plants that contained the zong <dig> promoter. the promoter polymorphism was detected in zong <dig>  87- <dig> and their  <dig> rils, among which  <dig> lines had the same promoter as 87- <dig> and  <dig> lines had the same promoter as zong <dig>  we further examined the expression level of zmmir164b among these lines and found that the rils with the 87- <dig> promoter had a higher expression level, with  <dig> -fold  on average compared with the lines with zong <dig> promoters . these findings strongly suggest that the cis-element of the mir <dig> promoter is the main contributor to the differential expression of pri-mir <dig>  and it could be argued that other elements might also be involved in the regulation of pri-mir <dig> expression.

to further investigate whether the zmmir164b promoter from 87- <dig> showed higher activity in vitro than that from zong <dig>  we designed a promoter: gus reporter assay, including 87p-zmmir164b: gus  and zong3p-zmmir164b: gus . tobacco leaves were infiltrated with agrobacterium that harbored these constructs, and gus activity expression was analyzed by spectrophotometric assays. we also transformed tobacco leaves with a gfp vector to normalize the transformation efficiency. our results showed that gus activity that was driven by the promoter from 87-1was significantly higher than that driven by the promoter from zong <dig> and by the background , which strongly suggested that the different promoter activities of pri-mir <dig> resulted in the diversity of pri-mir <dig> transcript levels that was found between the two inbred lines, which may have led to the difference in mature mir <dig> expression between 87- <dig> and zong <dig>  in addition, the correlation coefficient between the expression levels of zmmir164b and the lateral root numbers among the rils was also calculated, but no significant correlation was observed .

discussion
zmnac <dig> played an important role in lateral root development
we isolated and characterized zmnac <dig>  which is a member of the nac-domain gene family and the first nac gene shown to be involved in maize lateral root development. we demonstrated that zmnac1has high amino acid similarity to a homologous gene, nac <dig>  in arabidopsis, which has also been reported to play an important role in lateral root development. in contrast to the other members of its family, zmnac <dig> showed higher expression levels in the roots than in other tissues. moreover, zmnac <dig> was more highly expressed in the roots of inbred zong <dig> than inbred 87- <dig>  and inbred zong <dig> had more lateral roots than inbred 87- <dig>  the ril populations derived from the zong3/87- <dig> hybrid showed significant differences in lateral root numbers and in zmnac <dig> expression. there was a significant correlation  between the expression levels of zmnac <dig> and the lateral root number phenotype of the rils, illustrating that zmnac <dig> is important for maize lateral root development. overexpression of zmnac <dig> in arabidopsis resulted in a higher number of lateral roots than in the wild type, whereas no other dramatic phenotype change was detected in transgenic plants. however, once the lateral roots initiated in the transgenic plants, no further alterations in root development occurred. these results suggest that zmnac <dig> is specifically involved in the control of lateral root initiation. the phenotype of transgenic plants that overexpress zmnac <dig> was consistent with nac <dig> having its main function in the roots, as only lateral root development was affected.

nonetheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that zmnac <dig> plays roles in other developmental pathways. zmnac <dig> also showed a higher expression level in the ears, stems and male spikes than in the leaves, so we speculated that zmnac <dig> might also be involved in the branching development of ears and male spikes.

mir164-mediated zmnac <dig> mrna cleavage in vivo
plant mirnas have been implicated in the control of various developmental processes, including leaf development  <cit> , flower development  <cit>  and lateral root development  <cit> . in arabidopsis, mir <dig> has been predicted to target  <dig> nac-domain transcripts: nac <dig>  cuc <dig>  cuc <dig>  at5g <dig> and at5g <dig> <cit> . among these targets, cuc <dig> and cuc <dig> contribute to embryonic and floral development, and nac <dig> plays important roles in lateral root development. here we provide evidence showing that mir <dig> directs zmnac <dig> mrna cleavage in vivo at the 11th nucleotide of the complementary mir <dig> binding site, and this cleavage was conserved between maize and arabidopsis. in addition, zmmir <dig> showed higher expression levels in inbred 87- <dig> than in zong <dig>  which was the opposite of the expression pattern found for zmnac <dig>  suggesting that mir <dig> negatively regulates zmnac <dig>  these findings confirmed that this conserved mirna can regulate a target gene in a conserved pathway throughout evolution.

mir <dig> as a trans-acting factor contributed to the differential expression of zmnac <dig> between 87- <dig> and zong3
the results of the allelic variation analysis for zmnac <dig> in 87- <dig>  zong <dig>  and hybrid zong3/87- <dig> maize showed that the trans-acting factor, and not the cis-element, was most likely the major factor underlying the differential expression of zmnac <dig> between 87- <dig> and zong <dig>  we further isolated and compared the  <dig> kb zmnac <dig> promoter sequences between the inbred lines 87- <dig> and zong <dig>  and no sequence difference was found except for one snp . based on the zmnac <dig> mrna cleavage that was directed by mir <dig>  we consider mir <dig> to be one of the post-transcriptional trans-acting factors that regulates zmnac <dig> expression. however, no significant negative correlation was detected between the expression levels of zmmir164b and zmnac <dig> in the ril population, suggesting that the expression of zmnac <dig> is also regulated by other genes, as observed in arabidopsis. for example, xie reported that the f-box protein tir <dig> is likely involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of regulatory proteins that are required for an auxin response and can induce the expression of nac <dig> through auxin signals  <cit> .

further study revealed that both the mature mir <dig> and the precursor pri-mir164b were expressed at higher levels in 87- <dig> than in zong <dig> and that the promoter of zmmir164b from 87- <dig> showed higher activity in vivo and in vitro than that of zong <dig>  which might lead to the higher expression level of mir <dig> in 87- <dig> than in zong <dig>  it has been reported that arabidopsis mir <dig> negatively regulates lateral root development, showing a strict inverse correlation between changes in the mir <dig> level and the nac <dig> mrna levels. mutant plants that were defective in mirna biogenesis showed a higher level of nac <dig> mrna and more lateral roots. conditional overexpression of mirna <dig> decreased nac <dig> mrna and lateral root numbers. based on our results, it is possible to improve the root development in maize by altering the mir <dig> pathway.

arabidopsis nac <dig> has been shown to be a transcriptional activator in auxin-induced lateral root initiation. this study shows that zmnac <dig> also plays an important role in maize lateral root development and that zmnac <dig> expression is regulated at the post-transcriptional level by mir <dig>  overall, our data suggest that in 87- <dig> maize , the mir164b promoter has higher activity than in zong <dig>  leading to a higher expression level of mature mir <dig>  which then downregulates zmnac <dig> expression at the post-transcriptional level. this pathway might contribute to the smaller lateral root numbers in 87- <dig>  by contrast, both pri-mir164b and mature mir <dig> had a lower expression level in inbred zong <dig> maize than in 87- <dig> maize, leading to a higher expression of zmnac <dig>  thus contributing to greater numbers of lateral roots. it should be noted that no significant negative correlation was detected between the expression levels of zmmir164b and lateral root numbers in the ril population, which revealed the complexity of zmmir <dig> and its regulation of lateral root development in maize.

CONCLUSIONS
arabidopsis nac <dig> is a transcriptional activator in auxin-induced lateral root initiation. our study shows that the maize homologue, zmnac <dig>  also plays an important role in lateral root development in maize. our study then extends the research by showing that zmnac <dig> expression is regulated at the post-transcriptional level by maize mirna <dig>  overall, our data suggest that the mir164b promoter showed higher activity in inbred 87- <dig> maize than in zong <dig> maize, leading to higher expression of mature mir <dig>  which down-regulated zmnac <dig> expression at the post-transcriptional level. this pathway might contribute to 87- <dig> having fewer lateral root numbers than zong <dig>
