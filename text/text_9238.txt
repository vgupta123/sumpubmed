BACKGROUND
in flowering plants, the male organ of the flower is the stamen and the female organ of the flower is pistil. the stamen comprises an anther generating pollen grains and a filament supporting the anther. the pistil comprises the stigma, the style and the ovary. pollination is a process of pollen-pistil interaction during which pollen adheres, hydrates, and germinates on the stigma, the pollen tube elongates on an active extracellular matrix in the style and finally transports male gametes  to the ovary, releasing it into ovules to complete fertilization  <cit> . mate selection is crucial to successful reproduction and species survival  <cit> . self-compatibility  and self-incompatibility  are the two predominant forms of mate selection. sc is defined as self-pollen that can penetrate its own pistil and fertilize its own ovules  <cit> ; si is where self-pollen is prevented from developing on the pistil  <cit> .

tomatoes  are one of the most important vegetable crops in the world, and possess genetic diversities in fruit color, size, and mating system. in particular, the mating systems play key roles to control the reproductive habits between intra-/interspecies in tomatoes. generally, color-fruited species such as solanum lycopersicum, s. pimpinellifolium and s. neorickii are sc species, while some green-fruit species, such as s. habrochaites and s. chilense, are si species  <cit> . however, the growth of pollen tubes within styles differs between si and sc species. pollen growth is arrested at the middle style in si species, but not in sc. some models were proposed for growth behavior of pollen tubes within styles that are related to pollen factors such as f-box protein and pistil factor of rnase  <cit> ; however, the mechanism controlling the growth of pollen tubes remains unclear in tomatoes.

the transcriptome is the sum of all the rna transcription for specific cells in a certain functional condition, including mrnas, non-coding rnas  and small rnas  <cit> . rna-seq is a deep-sequencing technology  <cit>  that has many advantages compared with serial analysis of gene expression   <cit> , expressed sequence tag   <cit> , cdna-amplified fragment length polymorphism   <cit> , dna microarrays  <cit>  and massively parallel signature sequencing   <cit> . rna-seq has already been widely used for transcriptome research in miscanthus sinensis  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , wolfiporia cocos  <cit> , hevea brasiliensis  <cit> , populus tomentosa  <cit> , lolium rigidum  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> . it has also been applied to study pollination in maize  <cit> , and to study sc/si in citrus clementina  <cit> , lemon  <cit>  and leymus chinensis  <cit> . to understand what occurs after pollination in the styles of tomatoes of different mating types at the transcriptome level, we compared the transcription profiles differences between tomato si and sc species. the results provide valuable information for understanding the growth behavior of pollen tubes within styles.

at present, research into tomato sc and si has mainly concentrated on the s-rnase aspect, with no comprehensive transcriptome-level studies. thus, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to perform comparative transcriptome analyses of sc and si tomato unpollinated/pollinated styles using rna-seq. the results of rna-seq were analyzed by mapping, differential gene expression analysis, go and pathway analysis. the results revealed comprehensive information concerning si and sc, and provided clues to the molecular mechanisms of si and sc.

RESULTS

differential gene expression profiles of unpollinated  and self-pollinated  styles in sc and si, and hierarchical cluster analysis
to quantify the expression levels of the transcripts, ht-seq was used to count the read numbers mapped to each gene, based on the  <dig>  genes of the tomato reference genome. these data were then normalized to reads per kilobase of exon region in a given gene per million mapped reads  values, which were calculated based on the length of the gene and read count mapped to this gene. the rpkm values for each gene are listed in additional file  <dig>  to determine differential expression genes  of up and p styles in sc and si, we screened for degs between up and p styles in sc, and between up and p styles in si using the following criteria: log <dig> fold-change  >  <dig> or log2fc < − <dig> and p-value <  <dig> . we identified  <dig> degs between up and p styles in sc, and  <dig> degs between up and p styles in si . of these degs,  <dig> genes were downregulated and  <dig> genes were upregulated after self-pollination in sc;  <dig> genes were downregulated and  <dig> genes were upregulated after self-pollination in si . we used hierarchical cluster analysis to compare the degs between up and p styles in sc, between up and p styles in si, and the similarity of the expression patterns of the three biological replicates .figure  <dig> clustering of differentially expressed genes in unpollination  and pollination  styles in sc and si.



go annotation of all degs in scp vs. scup and sip vs. siup
to identify the functions of thee degs, we performed gene ontology  analysis. a total of  <dig> degs of sc comparing up and p styles were assigned go annotations and  <dig> degs of si comparing up and p styles were assigned go annotations. go has three ontologies: molecular function, cellular component and biological process. in many cases, one gene was annotated with multiple go terms. the go terms of  <dig> degs of scp vs. scup styles were categorized into  <dig> main functional groups belonging to the three categories and the go terms of  <dig> degs of sip vs. siup styles were categorized into  <dig> main functional groups belonging to the three categories .figure  <dig> go assignment and comparison of all degs in scp vs. scup and sip vs. siup. all degs in scp vs. scup and sip vs. siup were annotated in three main categories: biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions. the left and right hand y-axes indicate the percentage and the number of annotated genes in each category, respectively.



comparative analysis of go terms assigned to scp vs. scup degs and those assigned to sip vs. siup degs
to better understand the distribution of gene functions at the macro level, the go function classification of the degs in scp vs. scup styles and sip vs. siup styles were analyzed using the wego online tool. the comparative analysis showed that degs in scp vs. scup styles and sip vs. siup styles shared broad similarities in the proportion of genes in the three main categories, but differences were detected in many subcategories . most go terms of degs in scp vs. scup styles and sip vs. siup styles were categorized into the same biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions. most go subcategories terms were detected in both of scp vs. scup styles and sip vs. siup styles; however, go subcategory terms, including membrane-enclosed lumen, organelle part, molecular transducer, transcription regulator, biological regulation, developmental process, multicellular organismal process, pigmentation, reproduction, reproductive process and response to stimulus showed significant  differences in counts between scp vs. scup styles and sip vs. siup styles. these results suggested that despite certain mechanisms of sc and si appear to be conserved, the regulation mechanisms appear to be different between these two reproductive systems.

go enrichment analysis of all degs in scp vs. scup and sip vs. siup
significantly enriched go terms were identified using singular enrichment analysis . the results showed that nine go terms were significant in degs of scp vs. scup based on a p-value <  <dig>  and the false discovery rate  <  <dig>  cutoffs , which comprised two, three and four terms for the cellular components, molecular functions, biological processes categories, respectively. seventy-eight go terms were significant in degs of sip vs. siup based on a p-value <  <dig>  and the fdr <  <dig>  cutoffs , which comprised eight and  <dig> terms for the molecular functions and biological processes categories, respectively. the detailed results of the scp vs. scup and sip vs. siup go enrichment analysis are presented in additional file  <dig> figure  <dig> significant gene ontology analysis of degs in scp vs. scup and sip vs. siup. a. significant go terms of scp vs. scup; b. significant go terms of sip vs. siup . p-value <  <dig>  and fdr <  <dig>  for all significant go terms.



kegg pathway mapping of all degs in scp vs. scup and sip vs. siup
to further investigate the influence of the degs on pathways, statistical pathway enrichment analysis of degs in scp vs. scup and sip vs. siup were performed based on kegg database, using fisher’s exact test. the degs of scp vs. scup were enriched in  <dig> kegg metabolic pathways and the degs of sip vs. siup were enriched in  <dig> kegg metabolic pathways . the top ten kegg metabolic pathways and three p-value <  <dig>  metabolic pathways of the degs in scp vs. scup are shown in figure 4a. among these  <dig> pathways of scp vs. scup, those containing the greatest numbers of degs transcripts were “metabolic pathways”  and “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites” . other go terms associated with higher numbers of degs were “starch and sucrose metabolism” , “plant hormone signal transduction” , “biosynthesis of amino acids” , “carbon metabolism” , “plant-pathogen interaction” , “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis” , “glycolysis/gluconeogenesis” , and “amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism” ; the pathways of “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites”, “biotin metabolism”, “brassinosteroid biosynthesis” and “degradation of aromatic compounds” had p-values <  <dig>  . for sip vs. siup, of  <dig> kegg metabolic pathways were identified. the top  <dig> kegg metabolic pathways and two p-value <  <dig>  metabolic pathways of degs in sip vs. siup are shown in figure 4b. among the  <dig> pathways of sip vs. siup, those containing the greatest numbers of degs were “metabolic pathways” , “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites” , “plant hormone signal transduction” , “plant-pathogen interaction” , “starch and sucrose metabolism” , “biosynthesis of amino acids” , “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis” , “carbon metabolism” , “pentose and glucuronate interconversions” , “phenylalanine metabolism” . the pathways of “cysteine and methionine metabolism”, “plant hormone signal transduction”, “pentose and glucuronate interconversions”, “flavonoid biosynthesis” and “stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis” all had p-values <  <dig>  . in addition, the pathways of “cysteine and methionine metabolism” and “plant hormone signal transduction” were significant pathways in degs of sip vs. siup, based on a p-value <  <dig>  and the fdr <  <dig>  cutoffs . the detailed results of the sip vs. siup significant pathways enrichment analysis are presented in figures  <dig> and  <dig> figure  <dig> pathway enrichment analysis of degs in scp vs. scup and sip vs. siup based on kegg. a. enriched pathways in scp vs. scup; b. enriched pathways in sip vs. siup.



“cysteine and methionine metabolism” is the ethylene biosynthesis pathway, which was significantly enriched in the sip vs. siup analysis. degs were enriched in the step of o-acetyl-l-serine conversion to l-cysteine, l-homocysteine conversion to l-methionine, l-methionine conversion to s-adenosyl-l-methionine , adomet conversion to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate  and acc production ethylene . l-methionine conversion to adomet was the first step of ethylene biosynthesis, adomet conversion to acc was the rate-limiting step in ethylene biosynthesis and acc production ethylene was the last steps for ethylene biosynthesis. plant hormone signal transduction is very important to hormone-instigated biochemical changes during plant growth, development, and environmental information processing pathways, which were also significantly enriched in the sip vs. siup comparison. degs were also enriched in auxin signal transduction, abscisic acid  signal transduction, ethylene signal transduction, jasmonic acid  signal transduction and salicylic acid  signal transduction .

significant pathways enrichment analysis showed that cysteine and methionine metabolism and plant hormone signal transduction were the most important pathways in sip vs. siup comparison, and plant hormone signal transduction was the key biological event. all the plant hormone signaling pathways pointed to it and the significant pathway of “cysteine and methionine metabolism” also . this evidence indicated that plant hormone signal transduction plays important roles in tomato si.figure  <dig> significant pathways enrichment analysis and interaction network of sip vs. siup based on kegg. red circles represent significantly enriched pathways.



discussion
rna-seq is a powerful tool that can provide a global overview of gene expression at the transcriptome level. with reductions in sequencing costs and the advance of technologies, rna-seq will become more accessible to researchers to identify and track the expression changes of all genes  <cit> . the present study identified  <dig> significant  degs after comparing up and p styles in sc and  <dig> significant  degs in the comparison of up and p styles in si, using rna-seq analysis. the total number of gene changes demonstrated that sc self-pollination and si self-pollination are complex processes. this finding is consistent with other plant pollination studies. for example,  <dig> differentially expressed genes were potentially involved in the pollination response and si mechanisms in sheepgrass  <cit> . in a comparison of pollinated and unpollinated stigmas with styles,  <dig> degs were identified in si lemon  <cit> . these data demonstrate the complex nature of the transcriptome changes in sc self-pollination and si self-pollination.

pollination shares striking similarities with fungal infection in terms of biological responses and processes that result in cell death  <cit> . our transcriptome go enrichment analysis identified several significant go terms involved in pathogen invasion responses, such as defense response to fungus, response to fungus, immune response, and immune system process in the scp vs. scup comparison. this result is consistent with other plant pollination studies, such as in arabidopsis  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . however, go terms involved in stimuli and hormones were the most important of the  <dig> significant go terms in the sip vs. siup comparison.

pollination leads to senescence of petunia corollas by inducing many hormonal, physiological, and molecular changes  <cit> . ethylene is a gaseous plant hormone with a wide range of effects on plant growth and development  <cit> . ethylene is synthesized from l-methionine via the intermediates adomet and acc   <cit> . adomet is made from l-methionine by the enzyme s-adenosylmethionine synthase , representing the first step of ethylene biosynthesis . 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase  gene family members and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase  gene family members are two important enzymes for ethylene biosynthesis. acs catalyzes the conversion of adomet to acc, which is the rate-limiting step in ethylene biosynthesis. aco then catalyzes the conversion of acc to ethylene   <cit> . after si self-pollination, one sam gene  , five acs gene family members  and four aco gene family members  were significantly upregulated, which indicated that si self-pollination is associated with results in significant upregulation of ethylene biosynthesis related genes and ethylene production. it has been reported that ethylene biosynthesis is induced by pollination in petunias  <cit> . after sc self-pollination, although the pathway of “cysteine and methionine metabolism” was not a significant enrichment pathway in the scp vs. scp comparison, two acs gene family members  and one aco gene family member  were significantly upregulated, which indicated that sc self-pollination results in some upregulation of ethylene biosynthesis of partly related genes. the above results suggest that si self-pollination induces more ethylene production than sc self-pollination.

plant hormone signal transduction is very important to hormone triggered biochemical changes  <cit> . plant hormone signal transduction plays an important role in pollination of petunias pollination; for example, rna-seq revealed that plant hormone signal transduction-related kegg pathways were enriched in petunia corollas when comparing pollinated and unpollinated samples  <cit> . after si self-pollination, plant hormone signal transduction-related kegg pathways were significantly enriched in the sip vs. siup comparison, but not after sc self-pollination . this result indicated that plant hormone signal transduction might play an important role in tomato si. plants recognize and transduce the ethylene signal via ethylene receptors   <cit>  in the ethylene signal transduction pathway   <cit> . we identified two ethylene receptors, leetr <dig>  and tetr , which were significantly upregulated in the sip vs. siup comparison, both of which mapped to the plant hormone signal transduction kegg pathway. leetr <dig>  was the only ethylene receptor identified from the scp vs. scup comparison, and significantly downregulated in p styles compared with up styles. this protein also mapped to the plant hormone signal transduction kegg pathway, which was not a significantly enriched pathway in the scp vs. scup comparison. the above results indicated that si self-pollination not only involves the induction of ethylene production, but also enhanced the perception ethylene. although sc self-pollination may involve some enhancement of ethylene production, the ability to perceive ethylene was weakened by the significant downregulation of leetr <dig>  plant responses to ethylene initiates with ethylene binding to etrs and terminates in a transcription cascade of plant-specific transcription factors families, especially the ethylene-insensitive protein  <dig>  and ethylene-responsive transcription factor . ein <dig> protein is a key transcription factor for mediating the expression of ethylene-regulated genes and morphological responses. ein <dig> interacts physically with the ein3-binding f-box protein1/ <dig>  and is ultimately and quickly degraded through a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway mediated by the scf complex, which comprises a ring-box protein  <dig> , cullin  <dig> , s-phase kinase-associated protein  <dig> , f-box protein   <cit> . we identified one ebf1/ <dig>  from the sc and two ebf1/ <dig>  from the si, both of which were significantly upregulated in p compared with up styles. in addition, we also identified one skp <dig>  and one cul <dig>  from si, which were significantly upregulated in p compared with up styles. this result indicated that key transcription factor ein <dig> was negatively regulated by targeting ein <dig> it for degradation through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway after si self-pollination, but not in sc pollination.

a previous study demonstrated that auxin was significantly increased after compatible pollination and ethylene was strongly increased after incompatible pollination  <cit> . the last step of indole-3-acetic acid  biosynthesis is performed by aldehyde dehydrogenase. we identified one aldehyde dehydrogenase  from sc that was significantly upregulated in p compared with up styles and one aldehyde dehydrogenase  from si that was significantly downregulated in p compared with up styles. this result is consistent with the results of the previous study. auxin is likely to be directly or indirectly involved in pollen-pistil recognition and pollen tube elongation in nicotiana  <cit>  and might have an important role in the si response in plants such as theobroma cacao  <cit> , petunia hybrida  <cit>  and olea europaea  <cit> . auxins regulate plant growth and development by a complex signal transduction network  <cit> , which was included in the significantly enriched kegg pathways of plant hormone signal transduction kegg in the sip vs. siup comparison. auxin influx carrier  is a polar auxin transporter in cells that is involved in attaining a hormone maximum   <cit> . after sc self-pollination, lax <dig> protein   was significantly downregulated. auxins alter three major gene families: auxin/indole-3-acetic acid , gh <dig> and small auxin-up rna  to direct plant growth and development   <cit> . aux/iaa gene families: iaa <dig> , iaa <dig> , iaa <dig> , iaa <dig> , iaa <dig> , iaa <dig> , iaa <dig>  and iaa <dig>  were significantly upregulated in the sip vs. siup comparison, and only iaa <dig> , iaa <dig>  and iaa  <dig>  were significantly upregulated in the scp vs. scup comparison. for the gh <dig> gene families, only one probable indole-3-acetic acid-amido synthetase gh <dig> -like gene  was significantly upregulated in the scp vs. scup comparison. for the saur gene families, small auxin-up protein  <dig> , auxin-induced protein 10a5-like , uncharacterized loc <dig>  and uncharacterized loc <dig>  were significantly upregulated, and auxin-induced protein 15a-like  and auxin-induced protein 10a5-like  were significantly downregulated in the sip vs. siup comparison. only auxin-induced protein 15a-like  and indole-3-acetic acid-induced protein arg7-like  were significantly upregulated in the scp vs. scup comparison. these results indicated that although auxin was strongly increased after compatible pollination, because the auxin influx carrier   was significantly downregulated, fewer auxin-responsive genes showed altered expressions. during sc pollination, the auxin influx carrier  was not affected, resulting in many auxin-responsive genes showing altered expression after incompatible pollination. a previous study indicated that auxin influx carriers  were involved in auxin-ethylene interactions in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> ; however, whether auxin influx carriers  are also involved in auxin-ethylene interactions in tomato si is unknown.

ethylene and ja, as well as aba and auxin, have direct or indirect interactions  <cit> , but the roles of ja and aba in tomato pollination, especially in si self-pollination, were unknown. aba is a phytohormone that acts in seed dormancy, plant development and environmental stress. the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway is an aba biosynthesis pathway  that was enriched in sc and si. endogenous aba levels are regulated by both aba biosynthesis and aba catabolism: xanthoxin dehydrogenase is a key enzyme for aba biosynthesis and aba 8′-hydroxylase is a key enzyme for aba catabolism  <cit> . xanthoxin dehydrogenase  was significantly upregulated in sc not in si and aba 8′-hydroxylase 1-like  was significantly upregulated in si but not in sc, which indicated that endogenous aba levels increased in sc and decreased in si styles during pollination. pyrabactin resistance/pyrabactin resistance-like  family is an aba receptor that is very important to aba recognition and signaling  <cit> . we identified two genes of the pyr/pyl family: aba receptor pyl8-like  from si and aba receptor pyl6-like  from sc. pyl8-like was significantly downregulated in si and pyl6-like was significantly upregulated in sc styles during pollination, which indicated that the ability to perceive aba was weakened in si and enhance in sc. a previous study showed that pyr/pyls are negative regulatory receptors, whereby aba binds to pyr/pyls, which in turn binds to type 2c protein phosphatases  to inhibit pp2cs. snf1-related protein kinase subfamily  <dig>  is located downstream of pp2cs and is negatively regulated by pp2cs . snrk <dig>  was upregulated in si  and an snrk <dig>  was downregulated in sc, wherepp2cs are inhibited. in addition, snrk2s can phosphorylate b-zip transcription factors, which bind to the aba-responsive element to activate aba-responsive genes. phosphorylated b-zip transcription factors are important to active aba-responsive genes  <cit> . one b-zip transcription factor  was significantly downregulated in the scp vs. scup comparison, but not in the sip vs. siup comparison. this indicated that aba might have important regulatory roles in si. jasmonates are phytohormones that are essential for plant development and survival, and can induce jasmonate zim-domain proteins  to be degraded through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway, mediated by the scfcoi <dig> complex. in addition, jazs negatively regulate myc <dig>  which is a key jasmonate responses transcriptional activator  <cit> . we identified a jaz  and a transcription factor myc <dig> , both of which were both significantly upregulated in the sip vs. siup comparison. the tga family comprises key transcription factors of the salicylic acid -mediated signal transduction pathway  <cit> . after si self-pollination, tga family transcription factor  was significantly upregulated.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first global transcriptome-wide comparative analysis of styles from sc and si tomatoes using a high-throughput rna-seq. the enriched go term analysis of the identified degs showed that nine go terms were significantly enriched in the scp vs. scup comparison and  <dig> go terms were significantly enriched in the sip vs. siup comparison. the ethylene biosynthesis pathway of the cysteine and methionine metabolism pathway and the plant hormone signal transduction pathway play an important role in tomato si. further go and kegg analyses showed that si self-pollination induced more ethylene production and catabolism of aba, and sc self-pollination induced more auxin production and aba biosynthesis. moreover, the phytohormones ethylene, auxin and aba play important roles by plant hormone signal transduction in tomato si.
