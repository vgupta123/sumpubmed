BACKGROUND
fertilised ovules develop into seeds that contain the plant embryo. in arabidopsis thaliana, three distinct regions can be identified along the proximal-distal axis of the ovule primordium . the most proximal structure of the primordium is the funiculus, which connects the primordium to the placenta. at the distal end of the primordium lies the nucellus in which the megaspore mother cell develops. the chalaza in the central zone of the primordium initiates two integuments, each composed of two cell layers  <cit> . during ovule development, the two integuments grow around the nucellus and, after fertilization, develop into the seed coat that encloses the embryo . whereas the inner integument initially develops as a radially symmetrical structure that surrounds the nucellus, the outer integument grows only from the side of the ovule primordium that faces the basal end of the carpel   <cit> . the outer integument remains two-cell layered throughout seed development  <cit> . at later stages of seed development, cells of the abaxial  layer of the outer integument differentiate terminally into highly specialized seed coat cells that contain polysaccharide mucilage  <cit> .

the integuments are the only lateral organs produced by the ovule. the evolutionary origin of the integuments is still a matter of debate. the telome theory suggests that integuments originated from the fusion of sterile or fertile branches   <cit> . it is generally believed that the inner and outer integument derived independently. while the inner integument most likely originated directly from the fusion of telomes or sporangiophores, the outer integument is believed to have developed later from a cupule, a leaf-like structure surrounding one or more ovules  <cit> .

the development of the arabidopsis outer ovule integument involves the same basic processes required for the formation of other determinate lateral plant organs, such as leaves. the outer ovule integument is an example for an organ of determinate growth and characteristic form in which the rate and direction of cell division and elongation needs to be precisely regulated. asymmetric growth and differentiation are also essential features of its development. in case of the integuments, proper morphogenesis is especially critical, as an improper curvature or closure would lead to seeds with embryos that are not sufficiently protected. however, it seems that integument extension is relatively sensitive to alterations in cell division or cell expansion. mutations in short integuments <dig> , for example, lead to shorter integuments due to a reduction of cell number  <cit> . the result of mutations in sin1/dcl <dig>  on the other hand, show reduced integument size due to a lack of cell expansion  <cit> .

because of its simple two-layered structure, the outer integument is an ideal organ for the study of the basic principles of plant morphogenesis. for this a better characterisation of outer integument growth and cell fates within the integument is required. to address this, we have identified arabidopsis enhancer-trap lines with specific expression of the gene for green fluorescent protein  in distinct domains of the outer integument. these lines provided good markers for the characterisation of cell proliferation and differentiation during development of the outer integument. knat <dig> is a homeodomain protein that is normally expressed in the shoot apical meristem , and which alters leaf morphology when ectopically expressed in leaves  <cit> . misexpression of knat <dig> caused increased cell division specifically in the abaxial layer of the outer integument and showed that compensatory mechanisms exist in the outer integument to ensure its proper morphogenesis.

RESULTS
a screen for marker lines for the study of outer integument development
to obtain markers for the study of outer ovule integument development, a population of  <dig> arabidopsis c <dig> enhancer-trap lines  <cit>  was screened for gfp expression in the outer ovule integument. six lines showed stable patterns of gfp expression in this tissue. in seed coats of seeds that contained walking stick stage embryos, gfp expression in three of the lines  was seen throughout the outer layer of the outer integument, one line  showed expression in both outer integument cell layers, and two lines  showed gfp expression that was restricted to the micropylar end of the outer layer of the outer integument. four of the lines  were chosen for a more detailed analysis of gfp expression patterns throughout ovule and seed development using confocal laser-scanning microscopy .

to describe gfp expression patterns in those four lines we will follow a recent suggestion by skinner et al.  <cit> . we will use the term "gynobasal" to refer to the side of the ovule primordium that faces the base  of the carpel, and the term "gynoapical" for the side that faces the apical  side of the carpel. the terms "abaxial" and "adaxial" will be used to refer to the polarity of the lateral organs of the ovule, i.e. the integuments .

markers for the adaxial-abaxial polarity in the outer integument
gfp expression in ovules of line ks <dig> was restricted to the abaxial  layer of the outer integument . expression started before integument outgrowth in the epidermis of the funiculus . as the outer integument grew out, gfp was first only expressed at the chalazal end . during early embryogenesis, gfp expression extended throughout the o.i. <dig>  expression persisted in this layer during the later stages of seed coat development . gfp was also found in the l <dig> layer of the nucellus during early stages of ovule development . the expression in the abaxial layer of the outer integument resembled the expression of ino  <cit> . unlike ino expression, however, the ks <dig> marker was also expressed in a small subset of cells in the epidermal layer on the gynoapical side .

line ks <dig> also showed gfp expression in the o.i. <dig>  expression started around the time of fertilization. in contrast to line ks <dig>  gfp was initially expressed only at the micropylar end . later it could be seen throughout the outer layer of the outer integument . in addition, line ks <dig> also exhibited gfp expression in the abaxial cell layer of the inner integuments, where expression remained restricted to the micropylar end throughout seed development.

in contrast to lines ks <dig> and ks <dig>  line ks <dig> showed expression of gfp in both outer integument layers. gfp fluorescence was observed before integument outgrowth in the region immediately underneath the chalaza . in the early stages of ovule development, gfp expression was only seen in the o.i. <dig> . during early seed development gfp fluorescence then was also detected in the o.i. <dig>  expression of gfp remained in both outer integument layers during the late stages of seed coat development. faint gfp expression was also seen in the endothelium cell layer .

the markers also label adaxial-abaxial cell layers in shoot tissues
lines ks <dig>  ks <dig>  and ks <dig> showed expression of gfp in other lateral organs with the same axial preference as in the outer integument. in leaves and petals of ks <dig> plants expression of gfp was restricted to the abaxial epidermis . line ks <dig> showed gfp expression mainly in the leaf petiole. again, expression was only found in the abaxial epidermis  with erratic individual cells expressing gfp on the adaxial side. in ks <dig> leaves and petals, gfp was expressed strongly in the epidermis. like in the outer ovule integument, it did not show any axial preferences .

a marker for the distal region of the abaxial outer integument cell layer
cells at the distal portion of the outer integument  are visibly more elongated and are therefore distinct from the cells of the rest of the integument. gfp fluorescence in line m <dig> was first detected around fertilization and was restricted to these cells throughout seed development . gfp expression in line m <dig> therefore specifically marked this cell type. the m <dig> marker was not expressed in leaves or petals.

cells in the adaxial and abaxial cell layer of the outer integument differ in size and shape
we took advantage of confocal microscopy, which makes it possible to image individual cell layers without the need for physical tissue sectioning. line ks <dig>  which shows gfp expression in both outer integument cell layers, was used to visualize cells in the o.i. <dig> and o.i. <dig>  seeds with globular stage  embryos were analysed. images of gfp expressing cells in the o.i. <dig> and o.i. <dig> were taken separately . in  <dig> seed coats analysed, cell areas of the o.i. <dig> were significantly  larger than those of the o.i. <dig> . in addition, the majority of cells in the outer layer were 7-sided, while the inner layer had more 6-sided cells .

ectopic expression of knat <dig> causes extra cell divisions and reveals a compensatory mechanism during outer ovule integument morphogenesis
over-expression of knox homeodomain proteins confers indeterminancy on normally determinate organs, such as leaves  <cit> . ectopic expression of knat <dig> in ovules led to the homeotic conversion of the nucellus into carpeloid structures in a landsberg erecta  background . to investigate ovule development in knat <dig> over-expressing plants, the knat <dig> cdna was translationally fused to the gene of the yellow fluorescent protein yfp and put under the control of the constitutive camv 35s promoter  <cit> . to ensure nuclear localization of knat <dig>  a nuclear localisation sequence  derived from the sv <dig> t-antigen  <cit>  was added to the knat1-yfp fusion. twenty independent arabidopsis lines  were obtained. eleven of the lines showed the characteristic lobed leaf phenotype that had been described previously for knat <dig> over-expressing plants  <cit> . three lines with strong leaf lobing were chosen for further analysis of the t <dig> and t <dig> generation . nuclear localized knat1-yfp fluorescence could be seen in all cells of the ovules of these lines throughout all development stages .

to analyse seed morphology, seeds were stained with the fluorescent dye safranin o and viewed with the confocal microscope. seeds of the knat <dig> over-expressing plants showed two obvious morphological differences to wild type c <dig> seed:

1) the shape of an arabidopsis wild type seed resembles an ellipsoid with the poles being at and opposite the side where the funiculus was attached. in wild type seed, the integuments closed up with the funiculus approximately in the middle of the funicular side of the seed. in seeds of knat <dig> over-expressers this closing was shifted towards the gynobasal side .

2) seed coat cell sizes were obviously reduced in knat <dig> over-expressing lines . seed coat cell area sizes  of three seeds of three knat <dig> over-expressing lines were measured and compared to wild type. cell areas in the seed coat of the knat <dig> over-expressing lines were about half the size of the wild type cell areas . this difference was highly significant . since seed sizes of wild type and knat <dig> misexpressing lines were not different , ectopic expression of knat <dig> thus caused the formation of about twice as many cells in the outer seed coat layer.

reduced cell size was not a general feature of knat <dig> over-expression. cell areas were measured in the abaxial and adaxial layers of the epidermis of mature petals . no difference in petal cell area sizes could be detected between knat <dig> over-expressers and wild type .

to compare the knat <dig> overexpression phenotype with the phenotype reported for overexpression of knat <dig>  we also introduced the 35s:knat1-yfp-nls construct into a ler background. reduced seed coat cell sizes similar to those observed in the c <dig> background were detected , but no homeotic conversions were observed.

the seed coat was normal in plants transgenic for a 35s:knat5-yfp-nls construct  . thus, we can exclude the formal possibility that yfp in the nucleus interferes with normal cell proliferation.

extra cell divisions in knat <dig> over-expressing plants occur specifically in the abaxial layer of the outer integument after fertilisation
to follow seed coat development in the knat <dig> over-expressing plants, we crossed the enhancer trap lines m <dig>  ks <dig>  ks <dig>  and ks <dig>  and a line that constitutively expresses a plasma membrane localised form of gfp  <cit>  into the knat <dig> over-expressing lines. for comparison, the marker lines were also backcrossed into c <dig>  developing ovules and seeds were analysed in the f <dig> generation.

the progeny of crosses of the membrane-marker line to the knat <dig> over-expressing plants were used to analyze cell area sizes of the abaxial layer  before fertilization. cells in the outer layer of the outer integument had the same size in wild type and knat <dig> over-expressing plants .

crosses to line ks <dig> were used to analyse cell sizes of both outer integument layers after ovule fertilization. images of both cell layers of seeds of different developmental stages were taken. cell area measurements showed that only the cells in the abaxial layer of the outer integument of knat <dig> over-expressing plants were smaller than in wild type. from early embryo development onwards, the ratio of abaxial:adaxial cell area sizes was  <dig> : <dig> in a wild type background and  <dig> : <dig> in a knat <dig> over-expressing background  . these numbers suggest that, on average, cells underwent one extra cell division in the o.i. <dig> of the knat <dig> over-expressing plants around or shortly after fertilization. therefore, in knat <dig> over-expressing lines, the size of cells in the abaxial layer of the outer integument was more similar to those of the adaxial cell layer.

we can exclude that the different response to knat <dig> misexpression in the two cell layers of the outer integument was the result of different activities of the 35s promoter used for knat <dig> misexpression in those layers: the 35s promoter showed uniform expression throughout ovule development .

ectopic expression of knat <dig> causes altered marker gene expression
crosses of line ks <dig> to the knat <dig> over-expressing lines resulted in plants with markedly reduced expression of gfp in the o.i. <dig>  gfp was only expressed in a subset of random cells, and the outcome of the expression was later in relation to expression of gfp in a ks <dig> line that was backcrossed to c <dig> . in contrast, the knat1-yfp-nls fusion was normally expressed throughout the o.i. <dig>  excluding cosuppression of the fluorescent protein genes . this shows an alteration of cell fate in the abaxial cell layer. down-regulation of the ks <dig> marker was specific for the integument, as it was not observed in leaves of knat <dig> over-expressing plants.

over-proliferation of cells in the outer integument results in a more pronounced hyponastic growth of the integument
during wild type seed development, the micropylar end and the chalazal end of the integuments are approximately levelled. this is reflected by the shape of the endothelium. figure 8a, b shows seeds of wild type and knat <dig> over-expressers during early embryo development. the endothelium accumulates proanthocyanidins and can therefore be selectively stained with vanillin. unlike in wild type, the micropylar end was positioned below the chalazal end in the ovules of plants over-expressing knat <dig> 

the same was seen in line m <dig> that had been crossed to knat <dig> over-expressing plants. with ectopic expression of knat <dig>  the region of gfp expression in m <dig> at the micropylar end of the integument was shifted towards the gynobasal side. in addition, the gfp expression domain was longer than in wild type because more cells expressed gfp at the micropylar end . unlike the rest of the integument, cells at the micropylar end did not seem to be able to compensate fully for the extra cell division by reducing their size. therefore more cells of almost normal size were expressing the gfp marker.

in summary, although reduced cell elongation largely compensated for the extra cell division in the o.i. <dig> of plants with ectopic expression of knat <dig>  a more pronounced hyponastic growth of the integument was still noticeable. the shape of the seed of knat <dig> over-expressing plants was slightly distorted, with the closure of the integuments shifted towards the gynobasal side . as a result of the ovule bending, more tissue was exposed on the funicular end that was not protected by a seed coat .

in mature arabidopsis seeds the embryo lies bent with the root tip at the micropylar end and the cotyledon tips at the chalazal end of the seed  <cit> . therefore the root tip lies closest to the unprotected area of the knat <dig> over-expressing plant seed. we noticed that seedlings of knat <dig> over-expressing lines were often impaired in root growth and developed secondary roots at a much earlier stage . these seedlings seemed to have localized tissue damage in the embryonic root tip and occasionally also at the tip of the cotyledons . to quantify our observations, seeds  of c <dig> and knat <dig> over-expressing lines were germinated and the number of seedlings with impaired root growth was counted. while wild type roots grew normally,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of seedlings of the knat <dig> over-expressers showed impaired growth. sodium hypochlorite treatment, as commonly used for the surface sterilization of seeds, dramatically increased the number of seedlings with severely impaired root growth. treatment with na-hypochlorite for  <dig> minutes led to 20% and 36% seedlings with damaged root tips, respectively . an exposure for  <dig> minutes resulted in more than 90% of seedlings with non-viable root tips in both transgenic lines . therefore, the seed coats of knat <dig> over-expressing plants provided less effective protection against the bleach solution, and cells at the site of closure of the integuments were most vulnerable to damage.

discussion
domains of gene expression in the outer integument
we have selected four arabidopsis enhancer-trap lines  <cit>  for the study of gene expression domains in the outer ovule integument. these lines expressed gfp under the control of endogenous enhancers, depending on the insertion of the enhancer-trap construct into the plant genome. the lines obtained in this study can be used for the analysis of ovule development, as has been shown here for the analysis of knat <dig> misexpressing ovules.

two main points can be made from the study of gfp expression in the enhancer-trap lines: 1) the different cell identities of cells in the o.i. <dig> and in the o.i. <dig> are laid down during early integument development and are maintained. lines ks <dig> and ks <dig> showed gfp expression in the o.i. <dig> but not in the o.i. <dig> of the developing outer integument in ovules before fertilization. ino also shows a similar expression pattern  <cit> . the establishment of polarity in the integuments might be important for the outgrowth of the integuments, as has been shown for leaves . in contrast to ino, gfp expression in lines ks <dig> and ks <dig> did not show axial preferences with respect to the gynoecium's axis. lines ks <dig> and ks <dig> showed gfp expression in the outer layer of the outer integument also throughout seed development. the differences between o.i. <dig> and o.i. <dig> become obvious during late seed coat development when only cells of the o.i. <dig> differentiate into mucilage containing seed coat cells  <cit> .

2) cells at the micropylar end of both seed integuments are distinct from the rest of the integument cells. these cells also show obvious morphological differences, as they are noticeably longer than the average integument cells  <cit> . moreover, they responded differently to knat <dig> misexpression. the morphological differences were reflected by the expression of markers that were not present in the rest of the integument. line m <dig> specifically marked cells at the micropylar end of the o.i. <dig> after fertilization and during seed development. line ks <dig> marked this area in the outer cell layer of both integuments. it is likely that cells at the micropylar end have specific functions such as the protection of the embryo, which is growing from the micropylar end. moreover, the region includes cells that are among the earliest to undergo elongation during integument growth. the differential expansion of these cells may help bend this tissue to form the characteristic shape of the ovule.

similarities of leaf and outer integument polarity
the expression patterns of our marker lines support the theory that the outer integument developed from a leaf-like structure  <cit> . while lines ks <dig>  ks <dig>  and ks <dig> with gfp expression in the outer integument did not show expression in the inner integuments, they all showed gfp expression in leaves and some also in other leaf-like structures, such as petals. moreover, the markers that were expressed on the abaxial side of the outer integument  also showed the same polar expression in leaves. so far, no gene has been found that is exclusively expressed in the o.i. <dig>  to date, we also have not identified an enhancer-trap line that shows gfp expression solely in the o.i. <dig> . surprisingly, it has been shown recently that phabulosa , a homeodomain gene that is expressed on the adaxial side of leaves  <cit> , is expressed in the inner integument  <cit> . this led to the speculation that the two integuments of the bitegmic arabidopsis ovule might have been derived through the splitting of one integument of a unitegmic precursor  <cit> . according to this, however, we would expect gfp expression in line ks <dig> to be found in both integuments, as gfp was expressed in all leaf cell layers in this line. in order to clarify these contradicting findings we need to investigate the expression patterns of more ovule-expressed genes on a whole plant level.

knat <dig> overexpression phenotype
many genes that play a role in sam development are also important for ovule development and vice versa. although knat <dig> is not normally expressed in ovules  <cit> , it is likely that knat <dig>  when expressed in the ovule, can interact with other proteins that are normal knat <dig> interaction partners in the sam. moreover, other knox genes could be expressed in the ovule and be involved in the regulation of meristematic activity during integument development. in many cases members of a gene family have become functionally diversified by changes in their expression patterns but their activities are still interchangeable. several members of the yabby family, for example, can restore integument outgrowth in ino- <dig> mutants. however, only the ovule expressed ino is sensitive to superman  regulation that limits ino expression to the gynobasal side of the ovule primordium  <cit> . accordingly, knat <dig> could partially adopt the role of another knox homeodomain protein but would be insensitive to proper regulatory mechanisms.

in the arabidopsis sam, knat <dig>  together with stm <dig>  plays a role in the transition zone where it allows for the amplification of stem cell daughter cells by maintaining their meristematic identity before they are consumed by organ formation  <cit> . in agreement with its role in the sam, knat <dig> over-expression phenotypes in leaves have been interpreted as being the result of a shift from determinate to indeterminate growth characteristics  <cit> . in addition, the knat <dig> loss-of-function mutant brevipedicellus  displays defects in cell division in internodes and pedicels, demonstrating that knat <dig> is also required for the maintenance of an indeterminate state in these organs  <cit> . cell differentiation, elongation and growth in the pedicels of bp mutants were more severely affected on the abaxial side than on the adaxial side, causing a change in pedicel growth angle.

expression of knat <dig> in the ovule integuments triggered ectopic cell divisions, consistent with a role of knat <dig> in maintaining indeterminancy. at present we cannot explain why the presence of knat <dig> only has a visible effect in the o.i. <dig>  however, the phenotype of bp pedicels also seems to suggest that the abaxial side of pedicels is more affected by the presence of knat <dig> than the adaxial side. it is also possible that expression of knat <dig> in the integuments caused a certain degree of adaxialization of the outer integument and therefore the o.i. <dig> would adopt o.i. <dig> features. two observations support this interpretation. first, expression of knat <dig> in the integuments caused cells of the o.i. <dig> to divide approximately as often as cells of the o.i. <dig>  second, a marker that is normally expressed in the o.i. <dig> but not in the o.i. <dig> was virtually absent in knat <dig> expressing ovules. as no markers are available that are only expressed in the o.i. <dig> we were unable to test the reverse situation.

regulation of cell proliferation during morphogenesis of the outer integument
we found clear differences in cell sizes in the two cell layers of the outer integument. cell area sizes in the o.i. <dig> were  <dig>  times bigger than in the o.i. <dig>  which indicates that during integument development cells in the adaxial layer undergo approximately one division more than cells in the abaxial layer.

misexpression of knat <dig> almost abolished the differences of cell area sizes in the two layers. formally, the higher number of smaller cells found in the o.i. <dig> of integuments of knat <dig> over-expressing plants could be the result of impaired cell elongation or increased cell division. it is more likely that knat <dig> promoted cell division, since cells of the o.i. <dig> were still able to elongate after the extra cell division had already occurred. a compensatory mechanism was in place in the o.i. <dig> that resulted in the restriction of cell expansion and therefore in the development of an outer integument of relatively normal size and shape.

during leaf morphogenesis, mechanisms exist to compensate for defects in cell division or expansion . as a general rule it can be stated that a decrease in cell number or an increase in cell elongation can be compensated for by increased cell expansion or decreased cell division, respectively. so far, there are only a few examples that an increased number of cell divisions or decreased cell expansion, as seen here for knat <dig> expression in the o.i. <dig>  could lead to similar compensatory mechanisms  <cit> . to our knowledge a cell layer specific increase of cell divisions, which would more accurately correspond to the knat <dig> overexpression phenotype, has not been achieved so far. therefore, the knat <dig> overexpression phenotype of ovules represents the first description of a compensatory mechanism that involves a decrease in cell elongation to compensate for increased cell divisions in one specific cell layer. strict control of integument size on the whole organ level and cell-cell communication between the o.i. <dig> and the o.i. <dig> has to be postulated.

for arabidopsis it has been shown that endosperm growth has a reciprocal effect on integument cell elongation to control final arabidopsis seed size  <cit> . here we show that, in addition to that, growth in the two outer integument cell layers is precisely and independently regulated to achieve coordinated integument morphogenesis. the outer integument would therefore be a good system to study the mechanisms of coordinated cell proliferation that result in the final shape of a plant organ.

CONCLUSIONS
this work shows that previously not recognized compensatory mechanisms exist to ensure proper ovule integument morphogenesis. moreover, we demonstrate that the outer ovule integument can be used as a good model system to study the basic principles of plant organ morphogenesis. the outer integument is a simple two-cell layered structure, consists of only a few different cell types, and is easily accessible by confocal microscopy. a marker line expressing gfp in both layers of the outer integument enabled us to measure cell areas in the two outer integument cell layers of developing arabidopsis wild type seeds and can be used for a high-throughput screen for mutants with altered cell division patterns in the integument. misexpression of knat <dig> in the ovule produces a clear and easily visible phenotype that can be used to identify factors involved in the regulation of cell division and elongation on the organ level.
