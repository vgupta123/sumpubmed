BACKGROUND
the protura is a group of mysterious soil-dwelling micro-arthropods , first described by silvestri in  <dig>  <cit> . traditionally, it was regarded as a basal hexapod group, but it owns many unique and primitive morphological characteristics compared with other hexapods. for example, they lack antennae and wings, the foretarsus are enlarged with many sensilla serving the role of antennae, eyes and tentorium are absent, they have anamorphic post-embryonic development, and they have  <dig> abdominal segments   <cit> . the proturan spermatozoan has a variable number of doublet microtubules , with no accessory or central microtubules. it is different from those of other hexapods, but similar to the sperm of sea spider . this probably reflects a high diversification rate, or a lengthy evolution  <cit> . historically, there were many controversies about the relationship of proturans to other hexapods, and their evolutionary position in the arthropoda  <cit> . this is because proturans are understudied, being so small and rare, making them difficult to collect, identify, culture and experiment on  <cit> .

the higher-level phylogeny of the major arthropod groups  continues to be a matter of debate despite extensive research based on phylogenetic analysis and genetic data  <cit> . almost all molecular analyses strongly support the pancrustacea hypothesis: crustaceans, instead of myriapods, are the closest relatives of the hexapods  <cit> . the hexapoda , which includes four groups, protura, collembola, diplura and insecta , was traditionally considered a monophyletic lineage based on the synapomorphies of body segments, six legs on the thorax, and adaptation to the terrestrial environment. the monophyly of the insecta has been well established by morphological and molecular studies  <cit> , but the monophyly of the hexapoda is less certain  <cit> . three basal hexapod groups  show many different features from insects according to morphology  <cit>  and ultrastructure of spermatozoa  <cit> . the mitogenomic data of basal hexapod collembolans and diplurans reject the monophyly of hexapoda, and suggest that some crustaceans are more closely related to the insecta than collembola and diplura  <cit> . however, recent studies based on est data and nuclear genes  support the monophyly of the hexapoda  <cit> .

the arthropod mitochondrial genome is a single circular dna molecule encoding  <dig> proteins,  <dig> transfer rnas , two ribosomal rnas , and one a+t-rich region for the control of replication and transcription of the mtdna. it is used extensively for studying phylogenetic relationships at various taxonomic levels. unlike nuclear molecular markers, mtdna is of maternal inheritance, and does not experience intermolecular genetic recombination. in addition, the mitochondrial gene order can provide additional phylogenetic information, since rearrangements appear to be generally rare events, and most mitochondrial gene arrangements often remain unchanged over a long evolutionary period  <cit> . mitogenomic data also strongly support the pancrustacea hypothesis  <cit> , especially with the evidence of the gene order  <cit> . the gene trnl <dig>  is located between rrnl and nad <dig> in the ancestral arthropod ground pattern, but is translocated to the position between cox <dig> and cox <dig> in pancrustacea  <cit> . it has been considered a distinctive synapomorphic character for crustaceans and hexapods. the mitochondrial genomes of basal hexapod collembola  <cit>  and diplura  <cit>  also agree with the "cox1-trnl2-cox2" pattern. so far, no mitochondrial genome information is available for the protura. this has impeded comprehensive discussions on the evolution of the arthropod mitochondrial genome, and the validity of using mtdna to study the phylogeny of the hexapoda  <cit> .

in this study, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome of sinentomon erythranum , to describe the molecular features of the proturan mitochondrial genome, to judge how these evolved, and to see if it has any phylogenetic information, which may help resolve the discrepancy on the monophyly of the hexapoda between mitochondrial and nuclear dna markers.

RESULTS
general description of the mitochondrial genome of s. erythranum
the mitochondrial genome of s. erythranum  encodes  <dig> genes, which is consistent with metazoan mitochondrial dna structure . however, the total size of the genome is only  <dig>  base pairs, smaller than most hexapod mitochondrial genomes, but similar in size to those of some spiders and mites . most of the genes are encoded by the majority strand , and only eight genes are encoded by the opposite strand : five trnas and three protein-coding genes  . the gene order differs from that of the mitochondrial genomes of all sequenced arthropods, and most trna genes are reduced . trnw-uca is the largest trna with  <dig> nucleotides, and the shortest trnas have only  <dig> nucleotides . the average size of all  <dig> trnas is less than  <dig> nucleotides. all  <dig> pcgs have the typical atn start codon, and have either complete  or incomplete stop codons , ta-, t--). the incomplete stop codons are presumably polyadenylated after transcription to form complete taa stop codons  <cit> . the stop codons of several pcgs have an adenine  overlap with the next pcg's start codons. such overlap is located at the junction of cox1/cox <dig>  atp8/atp <dig>  atp6/cox <dig> and nad4l/nad <dig> .

strand asymmetry
strand asymmetry  is a remarkable feature of animal mitochondrial genomes. the overall mitogenomic at-content of s. erythranum is  <dig> %, which shows a strong bias towards a and t, and is well within the normal range of arthropod mtdnas. the nucleotide frequency of the j-strand is t =  <dig> , a =  <dig> , g =  <dig> , c =  <dig> . therefore, t is much more abundant than a, and g is more abundant than c. the at-skew and gc-skew of the j-strand for s. erythranum are - <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. they are extreme and reversed compared with those of most arthropods, which instead have a positive at-skew and negative gc-skew . the reversed value of at-skew and gc-skew may indicate altered replication orientation of mtdna in the a+t- rich region  <cit> . the skew value is the farthest of all from the coordinates , meaning this proturan mitogenome has the most biased nucleotide composition ever reported for arthropods. the mitogenomic at-skew value of s. erythranum  is the most negative of all reported mitochondrial genomes, much lower than the second most-negative value from the american house dust mite dermatophagoides farinae . for gc-skew, only the values of the small pigeon louse campanulotes bidentatus  and tarantula calisoga longitarsis  are slightly higher than the  <dig>  of s. erythranum. it is unusual to find so many poly ts within mitochondrial protein-coding sequences. for instance, a poly t motif in cox <dig> contains  <dig> continuous ts, which results in the frequent use of ttt  codons. the exact reason for the occurrence of this motif remains unknown. in any case, the mitogenomic sequence of s. erythranum should be a good model for studying the mechanism of the base-frequency bias.

a+t-rich region
the largest non-coding region , named the a+t-rich region in arthropods, is located between nad <dig> and cob , with a very high a+t content of  <dig> % . there are two g-stretches  at 5' of the a+t-rich region. the a+t-rich region contains two tandemly repeated regions : trr <dig>  and trr <dig> . the repeat units are 'ttttgttaaa' for trr <dig> and 'tacttataatgtaaaatatttaatatcaatttaaa' for trr <dig>  all  <dig> repeat units are exactly the same in trr <dig>  but for trr <dig>  only  <dig> repeat units are identical. both trrs can form stable stem-loop secondary structures . we noticed that the length of the a+t-rich region shows heteroplasmy at an intraspecific level  <cit> . three kinds of length variations were detected by pcr amplification of the a+t-rich region from different individuals. the length heteroplasmy of the a+t-rich region is further confirmed by sequencing the pcr products after cloning. the copy number of trr <dig> does vary in different individuals.

transfer rnas
the predicted secondary structures indicate that most trnas in our sequence have truncated structures . among the  <dig> trnas,  <dig> of them lack a tÎ¨c loop, and trns-gcu, trny and trnc lack the dihydrouridine  arm. the lack of the dhu arm in trns-gcu is very common in metazoan mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . trnc is coded by the j-strand and shares  <dig> nucleotides with trnw, which is coded by the n-strand. studies on nematode mtdnas have proven that extremely reduced trnas, like those of s. erythranum, can function properly  <cit> . the extensive loss of the cloverleaf structures of trnas has been found in many groups of nematodes and arachnids  <cit> , but to our knowledge, so many abnormal trna secondary structures within one mitochondrial genome have only been detected in very few hexapods, such as gall midges   <cit> . this suggests the independent origin of these truncated trna structural features in s. erythranum  <cit> .

gene rearrangements and possible evolutionary mechanisms
compared with the arthropod ground pattern ,  <dig> of  <dig> genes in our proturan sequence have been rearranged: eight trna genes , two rrna genes  and one pcg . the rearrangements can be divided into five categories : 1) the translocation of trnf; 2) the remote translocation and inversion of trnp; 3) the local inversion of the gene block ; 4) the reshuffle of the trna gene region from trni to trnc; 5) the relocation of the a+t-rich region.

rearrangements  <dig> and 2: the translocation of trnf may be an independent event, and this kind of minor rearrangement is very common in mtdna  <cit> . the trnp changed its coding strand from n to j during its "long range" translocation, and this situation is rarely reported.

rearrangements  <dig> and 4: the tandem duplication and random loss  model is a popular hypothesis for explaining many mtdna gene rearrangements  <cit> . here, it can readily explain the reshuffling of trnas in the region from trni to trnc , although it does not explain the gene inversion . for that inversion, the implication is strong that the gene block "rrns-v-rrnl-trnl2-trnl1-nad1" was locally reversed as a whole. gene inversions are probably the result of intra-molecular recombination, which can not only rearrange parts of the genome but also invert them at the same time. in the mitogenomic sequence of s. erythranum, both gene relocation and inversion must have occurred, although it is uncertain which of these two processes dominated. here, we have some new thoughts. for the tdrl model, gene duplication is necessary, which can be achieved by replication slippage in single stranded templates. at the same time, a loop must be produced by slippage, so it is possible for the loop to perform intra-molecular recombination simultaneously  <cit> . namely, the reshuffling of trnas and local inversion of a gene block may happen together in a stepwise rearrangement process. we further checked available mitochondrial genomes, and found that recombination involving pcgs has rarely occurred in hexapods, except in some lice whose mitochondrial genomes were extensively shuffled  <cit> .

rearrangement 5: it is not easy to explain the translocation of the a+t-rich region. there is a hint of an orientation change of replication due to the nucleotide-bias change from the majority type  , but it is hard to explain it as a consequence of the inversion of gene block "rrns-v-rrnl-trnl2-trnl1-nad1".

position of trnl <dig> and its phylogenetic implications
the mitochondrial gene order of s. erythranum differs greatly from the pancrustacean ground pattern . the most remarkable finding is that trnl <dig> is not located between cox <dig> and cox <dig>  the "cox1-trnl2-cox2" pattern was supposed to be a strong molecular evidence to support the pancrustacea hypothesis  <cit> . trnl <dig> is located between rrnl and nad <dig> in the arthropod ground pattern, but is translocated to the position between cox <dig> and cox <dig> in crustaceans and hexapods. in our proturan sequence, trnl <dig> is found between rrnl and nad <dig>  adjacent to trnl <dig> . this is almost, but not quite, the arthropod ground pattern, that is, given the premise that the gene block "rrns-v-rrnl-trnl2-trnl1-nad1" inverted as a whole, trnl <dig> and trnl <dig> must have changed their relative position compared with the arthropod ground pattern . the gene sequences of trnl <dig> and trnl <dig> of s. erythranum are very similar , so probably one trnl was copied from the other. this process can be explained by a mutational remolding hypothesis  <cit> . more mispairs appear in trnl-uag  than in trnl-uaa  , so the trnl-uaa  was most likely duplicated, and then one of the copies changed to trnl-uag by a random point-mutation of the anticodon triplet. after that, the original trna gene would have become a pseudogene or degenerated, so that the new trnl-tag replaced its function next to trnl-taa. in general, it cannot get a right paired trna duplicate from a wrong template, so we consider this as an evidence that trnl <dig> located between rrnl and nad <dig> is the ancestral state. mitochondrial genomes of other basal hexapods  match the pancrustacean pattern of cox1-trnl2-cox <dig>  <cit> . thus, the proturan s. erythranum is the only known hexapod whose trnl <dig> is in the ancestral arthropod position.

the protura has three groups: acerentomata, sinentomata and eosentomata. besides s. erythranum, a member of the sinentomata, we also sequenced the cox1/cox <dig> region  from baculentulus tianmushanensis of acerentomata , eosentomon nivocolum of eosentomata , and zhongguohentomon piligeroum of eosentomata . they all agree with the cox1-cox <dig> pattern and have no intervening trnl <dig>  in addition, cox <dig> is the exact neighbor to cox <dig> with no nucleotide between them in s. erythranum, b. tianmushanensis and e. nivocolum, and only four intergenic nucleotides in z. piligeroum. therefore, based on the available data, we believe it is more reasonable to conclude that the ancestral state is the cox1-cox <dig> pattern for all proturan mtdnas.

the "cox1-trnl2-cox2" pattern occurs in almost all hexapods. we compared all published data of arthropod mitogenomes , and found only eight of  <dig> mtdnas of insecta are not consistent with this pattern , but they are clearly secondary mtdna rearrangements or with multiple trnl <dig> copies. five of them are from the hemiptera, three parasitic lice from the phthiraptera   <cit> , one bark louse from the psocoptera  and one species from the thysanoptera   <cit> . their mitochondrial gene arrangements are reshuffled rigorously. the other three exceptions are from the hymenoptera   <cit> . it was noticed that in hymenoptera, trna rearrangements  are very common, especially in the hot-spot areas  <cit> . in abispa ephippium, trnl <dig> has four copies, but is still located between cox <dig> and cox <dig>  <cit> . however, most hemipteran and hymenopteran mtdnas are still consistent with the cox1-trnl2-cox <dig> pattern. in crustacea, only nine of  <dig> mitochondrial genomes are not consistent with the cox1-trnl2-cox <dig> pattern . in addition, only seven of  <dig> mitochondrial genomes from the chelicerata are not consistent with the cox1-cox <dig> pattern , and all eight reported mitochondrial genomes from the myriapoda are consistent with the cox1-cox <dig> pattern .

these statistics reflect the fact that translocation of trnl <dig> out of the cox1/cox <dig> junction has rarely happened within pancrustacea lineage, and no case of the cox1-trnl2-cox <dig> pattern was detected within myriapoda and chelicerata lineages, whose trnl <dig> tends to stay between rrnl and nad <dig>  this information leads to a single plausible scenario of the ancestral state being cox1-trnl2-cox <dig> in the hexapoda, but the proturan mitochondrial genomes likely retain the ancestral state of the arthropoda, the cox1-cox <dig> pattern. this seems to cast new doubt on the monophyly of hexapoda. the protura probably has a very ancient origin and a long evolutionary history, with distant affinity to other hexapods, evolving even earlier than other pancrustaceans. however, we cannot exclude the possibility of the secondary reversion to the primitive arthropod condition in the proturan ancestor since our gene sequence is so highly divergent. in this case, the mtdna of s. erythranum provides a remarkable example of secondary reversion.

phylogenetic position of protura
since the position of trnl <dig> cast doubt on the relationship between the protura and other hexapods, it is important to verify it with a phylogenetic tree. as revealed in figure 2a, the base composition of s. erythranum is so different from that of most arthropod mitochondrial genomes, long-branch attraction  can be expected. translating the pcgs into amino acid sequences is an effective method of dealing with the problem caused by base compositional heterogeneity in tree reconstruction  <cit> , so we performed all phylogenetic analyses on conceptually translated amino acid data of  <dig> mitochondrial pcgs using maximum likelihood and bayesian inference methods.

in the ml and bayesian trees, s. erythranum displayed a remarkable long-branch, and clustered with other long-branches . the at-skew and gc-skew plot reveals that hutchinsoniella macracantha, habronattus oregonensis and centruroides limpidus have a similar base composition to s. erythranum . after removing these three taxa, s. erythranum clustered with speleonectes tulumensis , but the bootstrap value and posterior probability are relatively low, which prevent us from determining the exact phylogenetic position of the protura . we also tested the phylogenetic placement of s. erythranum by sequential taxon removal, and it consistently showed a distant affinity to the insecta .

in our trees , the clade of diplura and collembola is sister to insecta, although the bootstrap value is relatively low. it is different from previous studies based on mitochondrial gene sequences of diplurans and collembolans, which suggested that some crustaceans are more closely related to insecta than collembola and diplura  <cit> . more arthropod taxa are needed to further discuss this problem.

the unusual long-branch length indicates that the s. erythranum mitochondrial genomes are evolving rapidly. the population of soil-dwelling proturans is usually very small. mutations may accumulate faster in such organisms due to the slow rate of gene flow. this also seems true for nematodes, parasitic lice and mites, in which high levels of genome diversity are commonly detected. the study on the mitochondrial genome of two diplurans also reveals that high genetic divergence existed in the morphologically uniform taxa  <cit> .

whether the protura is a real hexapod group or not has been debated for a long time  <cit> . the protura have many unique morphological characters compared with other hexapods: 1) they have no eyes and no antennae; 2) they have abdominal legs on abdominal segments 1-3; 3) they have no caudal cerci but have a telson tail, which is common in crustaceans but absent in other hexapods  <cit> ; 4) the axoneme of flagellated spermatozoa lacks central microtubules, which is similar to the condition in pycnogonid spermatozoa  <cit> ; 5) the serosa  of proturans retains the ability to differentiate into a tergum or definitive dorsal closure during embryonic development, which is similar to crustaceans and myriapods, but different from other hexapods. based on information from embryonic development, machida  proposed that the protura may have a much longer evolutionary history than previously thought  <cit> . however, a few recent studies based on est data and rrna genes have presented relatively robust evidence supporting the monophyly of hexapoda and pancrustacea   <cit> .

although the mitochondrial genome sequence of s. erythranum is unique, with little phylogenetic affinity to the insects, we cannot equate this to the evolutionary history of the protura. mitochondrial genome data alone are not enough to unambiguously resolve the relationships of protura, diplura, collembola and insecta. it is necessary to understand the limits and applicability of these data  <cit> . our sequence data showed many unique molecular features, which can provide valuable information for studying problems of mitochondrial genome evolution, for example, the mechanisms of mitochondrial gene rearrangements, truncation of trna secondary structures, and nucleotide frequency bias. understanding these fundamental biology problems should be helpful in phylogenetic analyses when using mitochondrial genomic data.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report of a complete mitochondrial genome from the protura. with highly divergent evolution, their mtdna has many different features to that of other hexapods, including nucleotide-frequency bias, gene order, and trna secondary structure. therefore, it is a valuable example to study the mechanism of mitochondrial gene evolution and rearrangement in the arthropoda.

our study suggests that proturan mtdnas do not agree with the "cox1-trnl2-cox2" pattern, which was thought to be an important character shared by hexapod and crustacean groups. it may be a result of secondary reversion due to extensive rapid and divergent evolution, but also may suggests that the protura have a long evolutionary history, and do not have a close affinity to hexapods and crustaceans. s. erythranum did not group with other hexapods in our phylogenetic trees, and its extreme long-branch implies that its mtdna underwent highly divergent evolution. more evidence is needed to verify this hypothesis and to solve the conflict between the studies on mitochondrial and nuclear gene markers.
