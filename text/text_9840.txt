BACKGROUND
the hippocampus, a very important structure for learning and memory, is among the most vulnerable brain regions after global cerebral ischemia. the rapid decrease of oxygen and glucose in the ischemic region can trigger delayed neuronal death  <cit> , and reperfusion may further exacerbate the injury. the delayed cell death occurs primarily through an apoptotic mechanism  <cit> . evidence has accumulated that a large proportion of the delayed neuronal death is mediated by caspase-independent pathways  <cit> . however, the signalling mechanisms remain largely unclear. recent studies have implicated mitochondrial proteins, such as endonuclease g  and bcl-2/adenovirus e1b  <dig> kda-interacting protein , as players involved in this pathway in non-neuronal cells  <cit> .

endog is an endonuclease normally localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, and translocates to the nucleus when cells are exposed to an apoptosis-inducing stimulus. after moving to the nucleus, endog cleaves chromatin dna into nucleosomal fragments independent of caspases  <cit> . the compartmentalization of mitochondria plays the major role in endog trafficking. the endog location site might indicate that this enzyme is not an instrument for immediate response to cell injury  <cit> .

bnip <dig> is a member of a unique family of death-inducing mitochondrial proteins  <cit> . in neurons, the expression of bnip <dig> is undetectable under normal conditions  <cit>  but can be induced by hypoxia/ischemia and oxidative stress  <cit> . the bnip3-induced non-neuronal cell death is characterized by mitochondrial damage but is independent of caspase activation and cytochrome c release  <cit> . it is presently unclear how bnip <dig> initiates neuronal death.

in this study, we profiled bnip <dig> and endog expression and translocation in cultured hippocampal neurons following oxygen-glucose deprivation . we demonstrate here that endog upregulates and translocates from mitochondria to nucleus in a time-dependent manner. moreover, the translocation of endog occurs hours before the observable nuclear pyknosis. importantly, we investigated the causal relationship between mitochondrial bnip <dig> upregulation and endog translocation and nuclear pyknosis by over expressing or knocking down of bnip <dig>  our findings strongly support a role for bnip <dig> as a signal protein upstream of endog leading to the induction of neuronal death.

RESULTS
ogd induces endog upregulation in primary neuronal cultures
primary rat hippocampal neurons at day  <dig> in vitro were subjected to ogd for  <dig> h and reoxygenation for  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h. normal cultured control and ebss-treated neurons under normoxic condition were set as controls. levels of endog expression were determined by western blot analysis. endog immunoreactivity was identified as the ~ <dig> kda protein band in the whole cell fraction after treatment. immunoblotting with a monoclonal Î²-actin antibody was performed as standards for calculation of endog expression. as shown in figure  <dig>  total amount of endog did not vary until reoxygenation was prolonged to  <dig> h and accumulated to the highest level at  <dig> h of reoxygenation.

endog translocates from the mitochondria to the nucleus after reoxygenation
we next examined the subcellular localization of endog to determine whether ogd could induce the translocation of endog. mitochondrial and nuclear fractions were prepared by differential centrifugation. cox iv antibody for mitochondrial and histone h <dig> antibody for nuclear fractions were used as sample loading controls. endog level in the mitochondrial fraction began to decrease significantly at  <dig> h of reoxygenation and further decreased with time exposed to reoxygenation . meanwhile, endog in nuclear fraction showed a significant increase at the corresponding time point and accumulated with increased periods of reoxygenation . these data suggest that the released endog from mitochondria translocates to nucleus.

nuclear endog translocation precedes ogd-induced neuronal death
to evaluate the role of nuclear endog translocation in ogd, we investigated the relation between endog translocation and cell death. at different time points after reoxygenation, the intracellular localization of endog was detected by immunocytochemistry; the morphologically damaged neurons were identified by condensed and fragmented nuclei using dapi nuclear staining. the result revealed that endog was mainly located in the intracellular space out of the nucleus shown as red fluorescence in normal control group or in ebss-treated group under normoxic condition . consistent with the results from the previous western blot analysis, the nuclear translocation of endog started at  <dig> h after reoxygenation and increased progressively . significant numbers of neurons displaying endog nuclear staining were observed  <dig> h after reoxygenation, a time point when no obvious morphological neuronal damage could be observed . thereafter, although the number of morphologically damaged neurons also increased with time, a great quantity of pyknotic nuclei could not be observed until  <dig> h after reoxygenation. furthermore, the proportions of morphologically damaged neurons were less than that of the endog translocated neurons at  <dig> h and  <dig> h, respectively . these results demonstrate that endog translocation from mitochondria to nucleus precedes neuronal cell death.

bnip <dig> mediates ogd-induced hippocampal neuronal death
to explore the role of bnip <dig> in ogd-induced hippocampal neuronal cell death, we first observed the expression of bnip <dig> following reoxygenation. western blot analysis revealed that bnip <dig> bands with molecular weights of  <dig> kd  and  <dig> kd  started to increase at  <dig> h of reoxygenation . we next examined whether the expression of bnip <dig> was sufficient to induce neuronal death and also if bnip <dig> was necessary to mediate neuronal death after ogd. hippocampal neurons were transfected with pegfp-c3-rbnip <dig> plasmid or pegfp-c <dig> plasmid as a control. as shown in figure 4c, exogenous bnip <dig> expression in normal cultured neurons led to about 40% of cell death after transfection for  <dig> h. to knockdown the expression of bnip <dig>  bnip3-mirna construct was generated and co-transfected with pegfp-c3-rbnip <dig> plasmid encoding the full length of rat bnip <dig> in hek <dig> cells. the inhibition efficiency of bnip3-mirna for bnip <dig> expression was 80% compared with the neg-mirna transfected controls as identified by western blot analysis . addition of bnip3-mirna to hippocampal neurons significantly reduced ogd-induced nuclear pyknosis when detected  <dig> and  <dig> h after reoxygenation .

bnip <dig> initiates the endog translocation
finally, we tested the hypothesis that bnip <dig> initiates the translocation of endog to nucleus in ogd-induced neuronal death. because bnip <dig> predominantly localizes to the mitochondria and homodimerization appears to be a feature of mitochondrial localization and important for bnip3's function  <cit> , we explored the subcellular localization of ogd-induced bnip <dig>  immediately after reoxygenation, upregulation of mitochondrial bnip <dig>  was detected,  <dig> h earlier than the endog translocation . we next examined whether forced expression of bnip <dig> induced endog translocation. as shown in figure 5c and 5d, the proportion of nuclear endog positive staining neurons increased significantly in exogenous bnip <dig> expressing neurons compared to that in pegfp-c <dig> transfected control neurons. furthermore, we explored whether knockdown of bnip <dig> could reduce the ogd-induced nuclear translocation of endog. based on the earlier result that endog began to significantly translocate to nucleus at  <dig> h after reoxygenation, we wanted to observe the effect that bnip <dig> inhibition would have on the percentage of neurons with nuclear endog at  <dig> h and  <dig> h after reoxygenation, respectively. knockdown of bnip <dig> expression significantly reduced endog nuclear translocation .

discussion
recent biochemical and genetic studies have revealed that endog is an important mitochondrial protein that emanates from the mitochondria during apoptosis and facilitates degradation of nuclear chromatin  <cit> . the present study, for the first time, strongly implies an essential role of endog in post-ischemic hippocampal neuronal cell death in vitro. western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry demonstrate that endog not only upregulates in hippocampal neurons following reoxygenation but also translocates from mitochondria to nucleus. this finding is consistent with previous results on other ischemic models, including cortical neuronal cultures subjected to hypoxia  <cit> , and cortical neurons of mice subjected to transient or permanent focal cerebral ischemia  <cit> . using subcellular fractionation with a detailed time course, we confirmed that endog translocation markedly precedes the appearance of biochemical markers of cell death. the good temporal and spatial relationship between endog translocation and nuclear pyknosis suggests a causal role of endog translocation in ogd-induced hippocampal neuronal death.

the present study also identifies bnip <dig> and endog translocation as early events in hippocampal neurons subjected to ogd. the increase in mitochondrial bnip <dig> expression was observed immediately after reoxygenation. the translocation of endog was detectable at  <dig> h and increased significantly at  <dig> h after reoxygenation. this is consistent with a previous report in a mouse model of brain ischemia, in which endog translocation was observed  <dig> h after transient focal cerebral ischemia  <cit> . although in a previous study we found that bnip <dig> and endog translocation occurred relatively late in cultured cortical neurons subjected to hypoxia  <cit> , the mitochondrial translocation of the bnip <dig> was before the nuclear translocation of the endog in both studies, which strongly supports that bnip <dig> acts as an upstream signal of endog. the discrepancy might result from either different neuron types examined or different ischemic models used. compared with hypoxia, ogd is a more severe stress to neurons and re-supply of oxygen and glucose may further exacerbate the injury. in fact, we detected an upregulation of bnip <dig> in mitochondria at  <dig> h after reoxygenation, which might imply that the mitochondrial translocation of bnip <dig> occurred and the signalling cascade triggered by bnip <dig> started during ogd. the expression of bnip <dig> in mitochondria further increased with prolonged reoxygenation, and knockdown of bnip <dig> reduced cell death, supporting a role of bnip <dig> in activating the cell death program. we also found that forced expression of bnip <dig> increased nuclear translocation of endog. on the other hand, knockdown of bnip <dig> expression reduced ogd-induced endog translocation. therefore, the present findings argue for the importance of mitochondrial bnip <dig> upregulation as an upstream modulator of endog translocation in ischemic neuronal injury.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we provide the first detailed description of the time-dependent subcellular localization of endog and bnip <dig> in the cultured hippocampal neurons following ogd. by exploring the temporal relationship between the neuronal nuclear pyknosis and the translocation of the mitochondrial death-related proteins, bnip <dig> and endog, we have been able to suggest an important role of mitochondrial bnip <dig> upregulation and endog translocation in neuronal death. combined with the findings that forced expression of bnip <dig> increases endog translocation and neuronal death, and knockdown of bnip <dig> decreases endog translocation and neuronal death, our results support the role of mitochondrial bnip <dig> as a signal protein upstream of endog leading to the induction of neuronal death.
