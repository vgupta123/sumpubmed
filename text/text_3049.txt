BACKGROUND
the arabidopsis rpp <dig>  locus in the columbia strain is composed of seven resistance  genes that are implicated in plant innate immunity   <cit> . r genes in this locus encode proteins containing an n-terminal drosophila toll/mammalian interleukin- <dig> receptor  domain, in addition to nucleotide binding site  and leucine rich repeat  domains similar to those encoded by most r genes in the arabidopsis genome  <cit> . two of the r genes in the locus, rpp <dig>  and snc <dig>  have been shown to mediate resistance to pathogens. for example, rpp <dig> specifies resistance to two races of the fungal pathogen hyaloperonospora parasitica   <cit> . the activation of snc <dig>  causes resistance to h. parasitica and the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae  <cit> . another r gene in the locus, at4g <dig>  shows the highest sequence similarity to rpp <dig>  the founding member of rpp <dig> locus r genes in the landsberg strain  <cit> . however, the function of at4g <dig> might be different from that of rpp <dig>  which is necessary for the recognition of a race of h. parasitica  <cit> . rpp <dig> locus r genes are coordinately regulated both positively and negatively  <cit> . rpp <dig>  snc <dig>  and at4g <dig> together can be transcriptionally activated by a positive feedback amplification mediated through salicylic acid accumulation  <cit> . in addition, low abundance small rna species that can target multiple rpp <dig> locus r genes exist in wild-type plants, and transgenic over-expression of snc <dig> can induce the cosuppression of these paralogous r genes  <cit> .

three mutant alleles, cpr <dig>  snc <dig>  and bal, which cause similar dwarf phenotypes and coordinated activation of rpp <dig> locus r genes, map to the rpp <dig> locus   <cit> . constitutive activation of defense signaling in all three mutants requires both salicylic acid accumulation and eds <dig>   <cit> . the snc <dig> gain-of-function allele is caused by a missense mutation in the region between the nbs and lrr domains that leads to elevated snc <dig> activity  <cit> . another mutant allele, cpr <dig>  is a recessive allele isolated after ethyl methanesulfonate  mutagenesis  <cit> . in contrast, the semidominant bal allele was spontaneously generated in an inbred ddm <dig>  mutant background in which genetic and epigenetic alterations accumulate over generations  <cit> . no mutations or epigenetic modifications responsible for the changes in phenotypes and gene expression have been reported for the cpr <dig> or bal allele. all three mutants exhibit elevated steady-state transcript levels of multiple rpp <dig> locus r genes, including rpp <dig>  snc <dig>  and at4g <dig>  possibly through a positive feedback amplification that is initiated by snc <dig> activation  <cit> . consistent with the more severe phenotypes in the bal variant, a higher steady-state expression level of snc <dig> was reproducibly detected in the bal variant compared to the cpr <dig> and snc <dig> mutants  <cit> .

many extragenic suppressor mutations have been identified for the snc <dig> allele after fast neutron treatment  <cit> . from ~ <dig>  m <dig> plants, zhang and li reported the isolation of  <dig> recessive mutations in  <dig> complementation groups that suppress snc1-dependent defense signaling. in contrast, a high degree of phenotypic instability was observed for the bal allele after ems treatment or γ-irradiation  <cit> . in the m <dig> generation, more than 10% of the bal plants displayed signs of phenotypic suppression that were associated with a decrease in the steady-state expression level of rpp <dig> locus r genes. all five independent m <dig> lines investigated in the study carried alterations that mapped back to the rpp <dig> locus, suggesting that the primary mechanism was due to either a revertant or intragenic suppressor allele. in addition, hybridization-induced instability was reported for the bal and cpr <dig> alleles in f <dig> populations after the two alleles were brought together by genetic crosses in f <dig> hybrids  <cit> . by following the segregation of molecular markers linked to the bal or cpr <dig> allele, we determined that the cpr <dig> allele was destabilized to a much higher degree than the bal allele in an f <dig> hybrid context. although these results revealed conditional phenotypic instability of the bal and cpr <dig> alleles, at least three questions remained unanswered. first, when is phenotypic instability induced in the bal variant? second, can phenotypic instability of cpr <dig> be induced by ems mutagenesis, as well as in f <dig> hybrids? third, is the unusual behavior of the bal and cpr <dig> alleles in the f <dig> generation limited to the specific interaction between these two possible epigenetic alleles in f <dig> hybrids? in other words, can phenotypic instability of the cpr <dig> or bal allele be induced in cpr <dig> × snc <dig> or bal × snc <dig> f <dig> hybrids?

here, we report that the cpr <dig> allele displays a high degree of phenotypic instability similar to that seen for the bal allele, while the snc <dig> allele does not. we observed a destabilization of phenotypes as early as the m <dig> generation among ems-treated bal and cpr <dig> mutants. we also found that phenotypic instability of the cpr <dig> allele was induced in cpr <dig> × snc <dig> f <dig> hybrids, in which the cpr <dig> allele interacted with a well-defined genetic allele. possible mechanisms to account for the unusual behavior of alleles affecting the rpp <dig> locus are considered.

RESULTS
phenotypic instability in bal and cpr <dig> mutants is first observed in the m <dig> generation after ems treatment
our previous work suggested that the bal allele is highly unstable in response to ems treatment as evidenced by a high frequency of phenotypic suppression seen in the m <dig> generation, which is generated by self-pollination of m <dig> plants derived from ems-treated seeds  <cit> . however, the genetic characteristics of phenotypic suppression events could not be studied in detail because each m <dig> pool examined in our original study was produced from a pool of ~ <dig> m <dig> individuals. to gain more information regarding the instability of the bal phenotypes in response to ems treatment, we investigated when phenotypic suppression is first established. the bal variant is characterized by small and severely curled leaves during vegetative development and short stature in later developmental stages   <cit> . we found that  <dig> of  <dig> ems-treated bal m <dig> plants develop chimeric sectors that resemble the morphology of heterozygous bal plants, consistent with reversion of a single bal allele. in the same batch of mock- or  <dig> mm ems-treated bal plants, we found that more than one third  of ems-treated bal m <dig> plants developed sectors with a stem taller than  <dig> cm, another sign of phenotypic suppression in later development, while no tall stems were observed in any of the mock-treated m <dig> control plants  . similar results were observed from more than five independent ems treatments. in two cases, entire m <dig> plants displayed the phenotypes characteristic of a heterozygous bal plant with no obvious sectoring after ems treatment. the homozygous status of a transgenic marker that we had introgressed into the bal background confirmed that these rare m <dig> plants were not heterozygous bal plants produced by pollen contamination   <cit> .

we found that ems treatment also destabilized at a high frequency the narrow and slightly curled leaf phenotype caused by the cpr <dig> allele . in about 10% of ems-treated cpr <dig> plants , we observed crescent-shape leaves, which likely represent phenotypic suppression on only one side of the cpr <dig> leaf . we also noted that the majority of wild-type stems and leaves developed from regions with crescent-shape rosette leaves. segregation of phenotypes in the following generation confirmed that the suppressed leaf phenotypes observed only in ems-treated cpr <dig> mutants in the m <dig> generation were indeed caused by heritable changes .

suppression of phenotypes is found more frequently than expected in the m <dig> generation
we determined whether m <dig> plants with suppressed phenotypes were only generated from m <dig> plants that had previously shown signs of phenotypic changes. in all  <dig> independent bal m <dig> families examined, we discovered multiple phenotypically-suppressed plants. six of these m <dig> families were derived from m <dig> plants with bal phenotypes, while the remaining  <dig> families were from m <dig> plants displaying a suppressed phenotype . we mapped the changes responsible for phenotypic suppression in a total of  <dig> ems-treated bal lines –  <dig> in this study  and five in our previous report  <cit> , and found that the change in each case maps to the rpp <dig> locus  <cit> . our results suggest that most ems-treated bal individual plants carry alleles that suppress bal phenotypes and that these alleles are revertant alleles, intragenic suppressor mutations, or dominant extragenic suppressor mutations tightly linked to the bal allele.

plants with a rosette diameter greater than the largest bal plant in the mock-treated control were counted as intermediate revertants, while ones with flat leaves were considered as wild-type revertants. m <dig> plants that displayed stems taller than  <dig> cm in addition to short and bushy stems resembling those observed in the bal variant were designated as chimeric.

we also tested whether the alleles responsible for phenotypic suppression are mitotically and meiotically stable from the late m <dig> to m <dig> generation. we determined the segregation ratio of phenotypes using seeds that were collected from siliques on stems taller than  <dig> cm on ems-treated bal plants. arabidopsis has two genetically effective cells, which are the meristematic cells that contribute to the reproductive lineages. consequently, large m <dig> sectors with a presumptive heterozygous genotype are expected to give rise to m <dig> progeny showing mendelian segregation ratios of 1:2: <dig> or 5:2: <dig>   <cit> . however, among the seven m <dig> families studied that were derived from large m <dig> sectors, only two families conformed to either expected segregation ratio . of the five remaining m <dig> families, two  had more wild-type m <dig> plants than expected . in addition, suppression of bal phenotypes was evident even in the six lines derived from parents that showed no signs of phenotypic change in the m <dig> generation . the inheritance pattern, as well as the frequency of phenotypic suppression, demonstrates that bal phenotypes are extremely unstable.

in the case of cpr <dig> m <dig> plants, wild-type m <dig> progeny were identified along with cpr1-like siblings for all lines tested in which a chimeric morphology was observed in the m <dig> generation. we observed a deviation from the 1: <dig> or 5: <dig> segregation ratio of cpr <dig> and wild-type morphology in the m <dig> generation that was expected regardless of the potential linkage of suppressor mutations to the rpp <dig> locus . plants with non-cpr <dig> morphology were derived from m <dig> parents that displayed cpr <dig> morphology . we conclude that phenotypic suppression in ems-treated cpr <dig> mutants and bal variants is not limited to m <dig> plants with a chimeric morphology.

plants with slightly curled leaves that were wider than cpr <dig> were called intermediate in phenotypic categorization. chimeric m <dig> plants were those that developed chimeric sectors of wild type-looking leaves and stems. 3a, 3b, and 3c: lines for which representative m <dig> plants are shown in figure 3a to 3c.

bal, cpr <dig>  and snc <dig> haplotypes show synergistic interactions in f <dig> hybrids
previously, we found that phenotypes in bal × cpr <dig> f <dig> hybrids are more severe than those in heterozygous bal plants   <cit> . this result suggests that the phenotypic interaction between bal and cpr <dig> haplotypes is synergistic as the cpr <dig> allele is recessive relative to the wild-type allele with regards to morphological phenotypes and activation of defense signaling. we hypothesized that this synergistic interaction is the result of transcriptional activation of the rpp <dig> locus in the cpr <dig> haplotype by the semidominant bal allele  <cit> . we tested this idea by combining the cpr <dig> haplotype with the snc <dig> haplotype or a snc <dig> transgenic background. the snc <dig> transgene under the control of the constitutive 35s promoter  and the snc <dig> allele affect snc <dig> activity at the transcript and protein level, respectively, leading to the activation of defense signaling in a dominant manner  <cit> . f <dig> hybrids carrying the cpr <dig> haplotype showed stronger phenotypes than those with the wild-type  haplotype, consistent with our hypothesis . previously, we demonstrated that the steady-state expression level of snc <dig> is significantly lower in the cpr <dig> mutant compared to that in the bal variant  <cit> . therefore, a stronger induction of snc <dig> expression in the 35s:snc <dig> × cpr <dig> f <dig> hybrid compared to the 35s:snc <dig> × bal hybrid was unexpected, suggesting that the snc <dig> expression level in 35s:snc <dig> × cpr <dig> is not additive   <cit> . in addition, bal × snc <dig> f <dig> hybrids also exhibited dwarfism and a curled leaf phenotype comparable to their parents . our results show that phenotypes characteristic of bal, cpr <dig>  and snc <dig> alleles are enhanced in hybrid contexts.

induced instability of the cpr <dig> allele after pairing with the snc <dig> allele in f <dig> hybrids
in addition to ems treatment, interaction between the bal and cpr <dig> haplotype in a hybrid context can cause phenotypic instability and produce f <dig> plants with intermediate and wild-type morphologies  <cit> . we tested whether bal × snc <dig> and cpr <dig> × snc <dig> f <dig> hybrids can also generate phenotypically normal f <dig> progeny. although bal × snc <dig> f <dig> hybrids exhibit a similar dwarf morphology compared to bal × cpr <dig> f <dig> hybrids, all  <dig> f <dig> progeny examined from bal × snc <dig> f <dig> hybrids showed dwarf phenotypes regardless of the direction of the cross . in contrast, f <dig> plants with normal morphology were frequently identified among cpr <dig> × snc <dig> f <dig> progeny . we genotyped  <dig> wild-type f <dig> plants generated from cpr <dig> × snc <dig> hybrids to determine which allele was associated with phenotypic suppression. in  <dig> of  <dig> plants, both the cpr1- and snc1-linked markers were detected while in the remainder of the plants only the cpr1-linked marker was detected. the lack of snc1/snc <dig> genotypes among the wild-type f <dig> progeny suggested that the destabilized cpr <dig> allele is associated with wild-type morphology in the f <dig> generation. our f <dig> progeny test of four phenotypically normal f <dig> plants supported the idea that these plants contain a destabilized cpr <dig> allele  that no longer induces cpr <dig> mutant phenotypes after hybridization . snc <dig> and cpr <dig> mutants in the f <dig> generation with characteristic phenotypes were produced exclusively from f <dig> parents whose presumed genotypes were cpr1f1/snc <dig> and cpr1f1/cpr <dig>  respectively.

discussion
here we report the genetic behavior of three different a. thaliana mutations that map to the rpp <dig> locus r gene cluster in strain columbia. all three mutations condition a similar, but not identical, dwarfing phenotype accompanied by leaf-curling. interestingly, only the snc <dig> allele behaves like a conventional mutation in terms of its phenotypic stability, as expected from this allele's known molecular nature. in contrast, the bal and cpr <dig> alleles show a high degree of phenotypic instability after exposure to ems and f <dig> hybrid contexts.

phenotypic suppression is induced by ems treatment during the m <dig> generation in bal and cpr <dig> mutants
one demonstration of the instability of both the bal and cpr <dig> alleles was the high incidence of non-parental phenotypes in the m <dig> generation . more than 1/ <dig> of ems-treated bal plants and 10% of ems-treated cpr <dig> plants carried at least one suppressor or revertant allele in the m <dig> generation . the frequency of phenotypic suppression observed in our ems-treated bal and cpr <dig> m <dig> plants is at least an order of magnitude higher than the expected m <dig> mutation frequency of ~10- <dig> to 10- <dig>   <cit> . we previously reported a high frequency of phenotypic suppression in ems-treated m <dig> populations of the bal variant  <cit> . now, we extend these findings by demonstrating that the frequency of reversion or suppressor mutations recovered in the m <dig> generation in the cpr <dig> mutant was also much higher than the expected frequency of recessive loss-of-function mutations after ems mutagenesis  .

the following observations suggest that ems treatment destabilizes the bal allele and produces revertant bal or suppressed balems alleles, which no longer induce dwarf and curled leaf phenotypes. first, mutations that suppress bal phenotypes in m <dig> plants show tight linkage to the rpp <dig> locus  <cit> , suggesting that the strain carries a revertant bal, an intragenic suppressor balems allele, or a linked dominant suppressor. however, f <dig> progeny of stable true-breeding phenotypic revertants and bal variants display the morphology of heterozygous bal/bal plants, arguing against the possibility that any suppressor mutations are dominant mutations tightly linked to rpp <dig> locus . second, li and colleagues recovered less than  <dig> %  of snc <dig> m <dig> plants carrying recessive mutations that suppressed snc1-dependent phenotypes, while more than 10% of bal m <dig> plants showed non-parental morphology in our experiments  <cit> . this large difference is not expected if the primary mechanism for recovery of phenotypically suppressed plants is extragenic suppression, assuming that the spectrum of possible extragenic suppressor mutations is similar for the bal and snc <dig> mutations.

we consider two different mechanisms that might explain why bal and cpr <dig> phenotypes are suppressed at a high frequency after ems mutagenesis. one possibility is that bal and cpr <dig> are conditionally metastable epialleles. specifically, the erasure and resetting of epigenetic alterations through dna repair initiated by dna damage  might suppress the phenotypes. the rpp <dig> locus is a complex mixture of transposable elements and tandemly arrayed paralogous genes that are targets of small rna species. genomic regions with this type of organization are frequent targets of epigenetic regulation  <cit> . nonetheless, the sectoring of phenotypes observed in many m <dig> plants suggests that phenotypic suppression by rna silencing, which acts systemically, cannot easily explain the phenotypic instability in ems-treated bal and cpr <dig> mutants  <cit> . an alternative hypothesis is that the mutation rate in the rpp <dig> locus in the cpr <dig> and bal mutants is elevated. this scenario might occur if the constitutively active state or possible aberrant epigenetic modification in the rpp <dig> locus contributes to the high frequency of phenotypic suppression, perhaps by making the locus more susceptible to mutagenesis when treated with ems. we note that the snc <dig> mutation induces transcription of rpp <dig> locus r genes through a positive feedback mechanism  <cit> , which might be distinct from the mechanism operating in the bal and cpr <dig> mutants.

in both ems-treated bal and cpr <dig> plants , non-parental phenotypes were more frequently observed in later developmental stages. this trend can be explained in three different ways. first, the number of meristematic initial cells that generate organs emerging later in development gradually decreases in arabidopsis  <cit> . the effect of phenotypic suppression in one variant cell among 8– <dig> initial cells can be easily masked by more abundant unaffected initial cells in the leaf development stage. however, suppression will be readily observable at the later inflorescence development stage since the inflorescence is produced from only one or two initial cells. second, phenotypically-suppressed cells might have a selective advantage in the stem cell niche in the meristem and over time outcompete those without suppressor mutations. this competition-selection model is consistent with the finding that constitutive activation of defense signaling in the cpr <dig> mutant has a fitness cost in vegetative growth  <cit> . third, suppression of bal-like phenotypes by rna silencing becomes obvious only two weeks after germination in transgenic plants over-expressing snc <dig>  <cit> . regardless of the mechanism responsible for high frequency of phenotypic suppression in bal and cpr <dig> mutants, a gradient of phenotypes in body size and leaf curliness observed in ems-treated m <dig> populations might parallel the generation of novel genetic or epigenetic variation in the rpp <dig> locus in natural contexts.

destabilization of the cpr <dig> allele is induced between late f <dig> generation and early f <dig> generation when paired with the bal or snc <dig> allele
in f <dig> hybrids, all possible allelic combinations of bal, cpr <dig>  and snc <dig> cause dwarf phenotypes similar to their parents   <cit> . stronger phenotypes were observed in 35s:snc <dig> × cpr <dig> hybrids compared to 35s:snc <dig> × bal or 35s:snc <dig> × wild type hybrids. the enhanced phenotypes are unlikely to be caused by additive interaction of the alleles because the bal allele is semidominant and shows stronger phenotypes than the recessive cpr <dig> allele. therefore, we propose that the enhanced phenotypes are caused by synergistic interactions between alleles of the rpp <dig> locus, and that rpp <dig> locus-wide transcriptional activation by snc <dig> plays an important role in these interactions.

unexpected non-dwarf phenotypes segregate among f <dig> progeny from the cpr <dig> × bal and cpr <dig> × snc <dig> crosses   <cit> . genotyping results in the f <dig> generation showed that, in most cases, the cpr <dig> allele is associated with these unexpected phenotypes   <cit> . given the frequency of non-dwarf f <dig> plants recovered  and specific instability of the cpr <dig> allele, it is unlikely that a recessive suppressor allele for the cpr <dig> phenotype was introduced from the bal or snc <dig> background. instead, the data are most consistent with a paramutation-like mechanism whereby pairing of the cpr <dig> allele and the other two alleles of the rpp <dig> locus occasionally induces the formation of cpr1f <dig>  a derivative of the cpr <dig> allele that no longer causes dwarf and curled-leaf phenotypes. in contrast to the phenotypic reversion noted in our ems experiments, no sign of chimeric development was observed in cpr <dig> × bal or cpr <dig> × snc <dig> hybrid plants during the f <dig> generation.

two models, which are not mutually exclusive, can explain the hybridization-induced phenotypic instability. in the first model, rna silencing of snc <dig> and possibly other r genes in cis causes the phenotypic suppression. previously, we showed that 21– <dig> nucleotide small rna species complementary to many paralogous r genes in the rpp <dig> locus are produced and demonstrated that over-expression of snc <dig> can induce coordinate suppression of these r genes  <cit> . in this model, preferential destabilization of the cpr <dig> allele is consistent with the observation that the steady-state expression level of snc <dig> is higher in 35s:snc <dig> × cpr <dig> hybrids compared to 35s:snc <dig> × bal or 35s:snc <dig> × snc <dig> hybrids . over-expression of snc <dig> and the possible presence of unpaired dna, which can be formed by out-of-register meiotic pairing among tandem repeats of the paralogous rpp <dig> locus r genes, are potential triggers of rna silencing. silencing of unpaired dna during meiosis leading to a stable epigenetic state can be inherited in the progeny was reported in arabidopsis  <cit> . in the second model, homologous recombination  during meiosis disrupts the cpr <dig> allele or produces haplotypes without any mutant alleles. consistent with an unequal crossing over mechanism, we recovered extreme dwarf and seedling lethal plants in f <dig> populations, such as would be predicted from rpp <dig> locus r gene amplification, along with wild-type plants . there is precedence for similar mechanisms involving r genes in other plant species. cf- <dig> and cf- <dig> are two homologous r genes located at the same locus in different lycopersicon species  <cit> . although both genes are meiotically stable in homozygotes, haplotypes carrying neither cf- <dig> nor cf- <dig> were produced at a frequency of ~1/ <dig> through meiotic recombination in a trans-heterozygote . in addition, meiosis-specific, intrachromatidal, homologous recombination that preferentially eliminates dna between homologous sequences was recently reported for the human male germ line  <cit> . we also cannot rule out the possibility that dna repair processes accompanying recombination may remove epigenetic alterations responsible for the up-regulation of rpp <dig> locus r genes or deposit silencing marks such as cytosine methylation  <cit> . meiotic recombination between cpr <dig> and other haplotypes may be facilitated by a constitutively active transcriptional state or by aberrant epigenetic alterations in rpp <dig> locus. these results demonstrate that the stability of the cpr <dig> allele can be affected by the genetic interaction of the cpr <dig> haplotype with the bal or snc <dig> haplotype, although the mechanism involved remains to be determined.

CONCLUSIONS
our results showed that ems treatment induces phenotypic instability in the cpr <dig> mutant, as well as in the bal variant. phenotypic suppression was observed in the m <dig> generation in more than 10% of the ems-treated bal and cpr <dig> mutants. moreover, exceptions to a simple mendelian inheritance from the m <dig> to m <dig> generation were observed for both mutants. we also found that phenotypic instability of the cpr <dig> allele was induced in cpr <dig> × snc <dig> f <dig> hybrids, in addition to cpr <dig> × bal f <dig> hybrids as previously reported. however, no phenotypic instability was observed among f <dig> progeny from bal × snc <dig> f <dig> hybrids. we conclude that bal, cpr <dig>  and snc <dig> alleles with similar phenotypes can be differentiated in terms of phenotypic stability after ems mutagenesis and hybrid formation. a high degree phenotypic instability in bal and cpr <dig> mutants suggests that metastable states, which are associated with constitutive over-expression of rpp <dig> locus r genes in these mutants, can facilitate genetic or epigenetic variation in rpp <dig> locus.
