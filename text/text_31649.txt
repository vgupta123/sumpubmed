BACKGROUND
epigenetic modifications that affect gene expression include post-translational modifications on n-terminal tails of histones and dna methylation. detailed analysis of epigenetic status can provide insight into the location and function of genetic regulatory elements on a genome-wide basis. a major challenge in the post-genomic era is the mapping and functional characterization of the full complement of transcriptional regulatory elements including promoters, enhancers, locus control regions  and chromatin domain boundary elements. as a first step in meeting this objective, the encyclopaedia of dna elements  project was launched, which aims to map the complete set of genetic control elements within selected regions amounting to 1%  of the human genome  <cit> .

the human desmin gene  locus  is covered in part within one of the encode regions designated as enr <dig>  which was chosen due to its high gene density and high non-exonic sequence conservation. enr <dig> covers approximately  <dig> kb of chromosome 2q <dig>  and includes des and the downstream genes but excludes its locus control region   <cit> . the des lcr is the only muscle-specific transcriptional regulatory element of this type described to date and constitutes a highly evolutionarily conserved element located between 9– <dig> kb 5' of des that has been shown to drive reproducible, full physiological levels of expression in all muscle cell types  <cit> . as in the case of β-globin gene clusters  <cit> , the des lcr may co-ordinate expression of some or all of the downstream muscle-specific genes within this region namely des, apeg <dig>  speg and chpf. this type of gene/regulatory element configuration has been referred to as a functional gene domain  <cit> . the 5' end of des is also associated with a small compact methylation-free cpg island  <cit>  that spans the first exon, a common feature for approximately 40% of tissue specifically expressed genes  <cit> .

several post-translational histone modifications have now been identified which affect regulation of gene expression such as lysine acetylation/methylation and phosphorylation on serine residues  <cit> . with advances in detection methods for these modifications, subtle differences between varying histone marks have been described. for example, histone h <dig> and h <dig> acetylation demonstrate a slightly different pattern throughout the gh <dig>  and the hbb_chick  <cit>  gene clusters both of which contain lcr elements. enhancers and other types of transcriptional regulatory elements can be predicted through a determination of their histone modification pattern, which appears distinct from that observed at promoter or tss regions. it is now clear that certain histone patterns are highly predictive of the transcriptional state of dna  <cit> .

eukaryotic dna can be methylated at the cytosine of a cpg dinucleotide, which generally has a repressive effect on transcription  <cit> . there is strong evidence to suggest a link between dna methylation status and certain repressive histone modification marks  <cit>  particularly methylation of histone h <dig> at lysine  <dig>  and  <dig> , which are important modifications for gene repression  <cit> . furthermore, tri-methylation of histone tail h <dig> lysine   <dig>   <cit> , has been shown to preferentially mark unmethylated dna in early development and cause silencing by recruiting repressive polycomb group  complexes  <cit> .

we have therefore undertaken an analysis of both dna methylation and histone modifications to gain greater insight into the types of epigenetic marks that are functionally correlated with the des locus and especially at the des lcr. as the epigenome will vary between different tissues displaying different gene expression profiles, it is important to conduct such epigenetic investigations in an appropriate range of cell types that will represent expressing and non-expressing states for a genomic region of interest. recent work has addressed this issue to some extent  <cit>  but here we strive to give a more detailed and focused analysis of a well characterized gene locus in primary human cells which are more physiologically relevant.

we have employed a wide range of techniques to substantially extend the epigenetic analysis of enr <dig> in primary muscle and non-muscle human cell types to provide insight into which types of histone modifications can co-exist at a given locus with a corresponding underlying dna methylation pattern. our results show that in expressing skeletal myoblast/myotube cultures generally histone h <dig> acetylation is broadly distributed across a gene rich  <dig> kb region of chromosome 2q <dig> encompassed within enr <dig> extended to include the des lcr whereas h <dig> acetylation localizes at the tss of genes. more specifically, the des lcr and first exon are enriched with hyperacetylated domains of histone h <dig> and that h3k <dig> me <dig> and me <dig> exhibit a different distribution pattern across this locus. in addition, cpg methylation combined with histone mapping identified one of the dnasei hypersensitive site  elements that constitute the des lcr as of potential critical functional importance. we found the cpg island spanning the des promoter to be unmethylated regardless of expression status and to be marked with h3k27me <dig> in pbmcs, which may serve a promoter silencing role in non-muscle cells.

RESULTS
chip-on-chip: global h <dig> and h <dig> histone acetylation patterns across  <dig> kb of chromosome 2q <dig> encompassing the des locus
the des locus contains three muscle specific/preferentially expressed genes, des apeg <dig> and speg, which are flanked by two housekeeping genes dnpep and gmppa. this region also includes the des lcr which lies 9– <dig> kb 5' of des and which is composed of  <dig> muscle-specific dnasei hs numbered 1– <dig> in a 3' to 5' direction  <cit> . analysis of the dna sequence that underlies the elements of the des lcr shows sub-regions of high  sequence conservation between rodents  and humans within or near each hs site designated with the letters a, b, c or d  <cit> . expression of des increases upon fusion of unfused  skeletal myoblasts to fused  myotubes  <cit>  .

the encode region enr <dig> which spans  <dig> kb of chromosome 2q <dig> does not include the des lcr as it terminates - <dig>  kb 5' of des. however, enr <dig> does span des and the more downstream genes speg, gmppa, accn <dig>  chpf, inha, slc4a <dig> . a small spotted microarray consisting of ~ <dig> bp overlapping pcr products was designed to extend the area covered by enr <dig> to encompass the des lcr . note: the pcr primers used to extend the region of the array are shown in additional file  <dig>  table st <dig> 

native chromatin without cross-linking, with a size range of mono-tetranucleosomes was isolated from cultures of human primary myoblasts, myotubes and pbmcs and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against histones h <dig> and h <dig> acetylated at multiple lysine residues, namely lysines  <dig> and  <dig> on h <dig> and lysines  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> on h <dig>  which have been associated with a transcriptionally competent chromatin state  <cit> . this allowed a complete analysis of the histone h <dig> and h <dig> acetylation pattern of this entire area in unfused  myoblasts, fused  myotubes and pbmcs .

the peaks of enrichment of h <dig> lysine acetylation throughout the region analysed corresponded to the tss of most of the genes including des . the des lcr was enriched for h <dig> acetylation approximately 2– <dig> fold above non-muscle pbmcs in both myoblasts and myotubes .

in contrast to h <dig> acetylation, which exhibits a relatively tight peak of enrichment localized to the des promoter, h <dig> acetylation displays abundance across the entire transcribed region of des  and extends into intergenic areas. this was also the case with other individual genes within the region such as chpf, which exhibited a broad enrichment across its entire gene body . a ~5-fold enrichment of h <dig> acetylation was observed at the des lcr and promoter compared with pbmcs . similarly to h <dig> acetylation, there was very little enrichment of histone h <dig> acetylation in pbmcs across the area analysed . see additional data file  <dig>  figure s <dig> and s3' for detailed analysis of individual genes with the region.

the current genome browser build hg <dig> only illustrates speg. however it must be noted that apeg <dig> is one of its isomers and is transcribed from an internal separate promoter  <cit> . the presence of the internal  promoter accounts for the presence of a peak of acetylation seen on the microarray at this position .

des and the des lcr show high levels of tissue-specific but a selective histone modification pattern
having obtained a general overview of histone h <dig> and h <dig> acetylation patterns across the des locus and surrounding  <dig> kb region, we next sought to obtain a more detailed map of epigenetic status specifically across the des lcr, as this constitutes a crucial regulatory element. chromatin used for the microarray analysis was analysed by q-pcr to assess enrichment for selected regions within des and the des lcr.

histone h <dig> and h <dig> acetylation showed a marked enrichment of between  <dig> to 15-fold above pbmc levels in both myoblasts and myotubes at all of the positions tested within the des lcr . element hs3c exhibited the highest overall level of histone acetylation within the lcr in both myoblasts and myotubes reaching levels of ~15-fold enrichment . we also observed enrichment of h <dig> acetylation across the des tss  but with the highest level present 3' of the first exon at position + <dig>  kb . this level of enrichment decreased by almost 2-fold at the second exon . histone h <dig> acetylation was enriched at similar levels  across parts of the lcr and des .

pbmcs did not show any enrichment of histone h <dig> and h <dig> acetylation across either des or its lcr reflecting these elements muscle-specific nature and function . the only enrichment of both histone h <dig> and h <dig> acetylation in the pbmc sample was seen at the tss of dnpep and htatip <dig>  which is as expected for ubiquitously expressed genes . we also investigated the chromatin structure between hs <dig> of the lcr and the des tss, a region at a position approximately - <dig> kb 5' of des and found no enrichment of histone h <dig> or h <dig> acetylation in any of the samples .

the microarray data correlates well with the higher resolution native chip  results both showing similar trends in h <dig> and h <dig> acetylation. however, the q-pcr and microarray sets of data are technically very different and therefore quantitative comparisons between the two are not possible.

histone h3k4me <dig> marks the des lcr
histone methylation patterns have been shown to mark different regions of a transcribing gene and to distinguish between promoters and distal enhancers  <cit> . we therefore assessed the presence of histone h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> at the same regions analysed for global h <dig> and h <dig> histone acetylation . this also allowed the correlation between histone acetylation and methylation to be examined. h3k4me <dig> displayed a widespread distribution across the region being enriched up to 20-fold above background levels at elements hs4d to hs <dig> within the des lcr . the unfused myoblasts exhibited a 20-fold enrichment across the first  <dig> kb of des  whereas myotube cultures showed the same level of enrichment but had a high peak of ~40-fold of h3k4me <dig> at the end of exon  <dig> of des . pbmcs did not show any enrichment across the des lcr or des but showed a marked abundance of ~25-fold above background of h3k4me <dig> at the control housekeeping gene promoter of htatip <dig> as expected from previous work  <cit> .

h3k4me <dig> was not enriched at any site within the des lcr within any of the cell types tested . however, there was a ~40-fold enrichment of this mark above background levels before the start of the second exon of des in both myoblasts and myotubes . this decreased sharply in the myoblast sample by the second exon compared to that observed in the myotube culture, which remained high at this position .

dna methylation status of cpg sites within des and des lcr
des is approximately  <dig>  kb in length with  <dig> exons and is associated with a small compact cpg island of  <dig> bp that spans its first exon and has a cpg count of  <dig>  a cpg percentage of  <dig> % and a ratio of observed to expected cpg dinucleotides of  <dig> . due to the tissue-specific expressed nature of this gene we were able to correlate the histone modification patterns we observed within des and the des lcr with the underlying dna methylation pattern in different transcriptionally active and inactive states. dna methylation was analysed using sodium bisulphite conversion coupled with pcr/sequencing in adult human primary myoblasts, myotubes and pbmcs at cpg rich areas throughout the lcr and des  and which corresponded to regions of high sequence conservation between rodents  and human  <cit> .

regions analysed within the des lcr included hs <dig> and hs4d . the two cpg sites within hs <dig> within the region of rodent/human homology were fully methylated in all the cell types analysed . hs4d contained  <dig> cpg dinucleotides all of which were unmethylated in the myotubes , showed a mixed pattern of methylation in myoblasts  but were ~96% methylated in pbmcs .

within element hs <dig> only sub-regions hs3c and hs3b were analysed, as hs3a does not contain any cpg dinucleotides. all the cpg sites within hs3c and b in the unfused myoblasts were unmethylated . within hs3b in the myotubes the majority of the cpg sites were unmethylated apart from  <dig> out of the total of  <dig> cpg sites analysed, which exhibited 90% methylation . all the cpg sites except for one within hs3c showed a high percentage of methylation  in pbmcs  demonstrating that this region is highly methylated compared to muscle cells.

the des tss genomic region was analysed to determine where the region of transition occurs between unmethylated and methylated dna in both a 5' and 3' direction . the  <dig> cpg sites within the + <dig>  kb-+ <dig>  kb region exhibit a mixed pattern of methylation in both muscle and non-muscle cell types , which indicates that the methylation-free cpg area of dna appears to end + <dig>  kb 3' of the des tss. analysis of a region ~ <dig>  kb upstream of the des tss at the start of the cpg island, showed that all seven cpg sites in this area lack methylation  in all cell types including pbmcs. therefore, this unmethylated dna is not related to the transcriptional status of des. the extent of the island is restricted to the gc dense region spanning the first exon of des . these results also demonstrate that the gene body of des is methylated starting before the start of the second exon even in expressing muscle cell types . gene body methylation has now been reported in several systems  <cit> .

the unmethylated cpg island spanning the des promoter is marked by h3k27me <dig> in pbmcs
dna methylation analysis showed that the cpg island spanning the des promoter was unmethylated in both muscle and non-muscle cell types . given that methylation-free cpg islands are usually associated with an open chromatin structure this poses the question as to how the des promoter region is repressed in non-expressing cells? the absence of muscle specific transcription factors in non-muscle cells could be sufficient to prevent transcription of des in non-muscle cells. however, the des promoter does possess ubiquitous transcription factor binding sites such as sp <dig>  <cit>  that would be expected to be functional and therefore suggesting that additional mechanisms may contribute to the complete silencing of des in non-muscle cells.

a possible candidate epigenetic mark for suppressing expression from the des promoter in non-muscle tissues is h3k27me <dig>  which has been implicated in marking unmethylated dna for silencing  <cit> . in addition, methylation of h3k <dig> has been universally linked to gene repression  <cit>  unlike h3k <dig> methylation which has been found at both inactive and active genes  <cit> . therefore, we determined whether h3k27me <dig> was present across the lcr and des in non-muscle pbmcs and muscle cells. the only region that was found to be enriched by 9– <dig> fold for h3k27me <dig> above background levels was across the des unmethylated cpg island in the pbmc sample . this peak of enrichment was tightly localized to the methylation-free cpg island and dropped to background levels by the second exon of des . no significant enrichment above background was seen in the myoblast/myotube cultures . interestingly, this mark was not seen at either the - <dig> kb region between the lcr and the des tss or across the lcr in pbmcs . in addition, h3k27me <dig> was not observed at the cpg poor promoter of hbb that is also silent in pbmcs . these observations provide strong support for the concept that h3k27me <dig> is a histone modification that marks silent chromatin at specific genomic locations  <cit> .

discussion
our work constitutes the first detailed epigenetic investigation of a muscle-specific lcr associated with des. we have conducted an extensive epigenetic analysis of  <dig> kb of human chromosome 2q <dig>  which includes the muscle-specific des locus and encompasses encode region enr <dig>  our work expands on previous analysis of enr <dig> on several points. firstly, the microarray tile was extended to include the des lcr, a crucial transcriptional regulatory element in this genomic region. secondly, we have analysed the epigenetic status of enr <dig> and especially the des and des lcr regions in human primary skeletal muscle cells, both proliferating myoblasts and post-mitotic differentiated myotubes as well as non-muscle pbmcs. therefore, unlike previous investigations of this region we were able to compare epigenetic patterns in physiologically relevant, expressing/non-expressing situations. thirdly, we have correlated histone modification patterns across the des and des lcr with the underlying dna methylation pattern, again in expressing and non-expressing states of the locus.

our results from microarray chip-on-chip studies show that in myoblast/myotube cultures the des locus lies within an extended hyperacetylated chromatin region that was not present in non-muscle pbmcs  suggesting a role of the muscle specific des lcr in establishing this active domain. the chip-on-chip results also highlight differences in histone acetylation between gene rich and gene poor areas over this  <dig> kb region.

high resolution nchip coupled with q-pcr was employed to validate the microarray data and dissect the histone modification patterns across the 5'region of des including its lcr. the analysis showed that histone h <dig> acetylation displayed similar levels of enrichment across the lcr and the first  <dig> exons of des in skeletal muscle cells . this is in contrast to h <dig> acetylation, which was more abundant around the des tss than at the lcr . the peak of h <dig> acetylation over the des promoter and tss may be accounted for by the presence of mef- <dig> and e-box elements within these regions  <cit> . mef- <dig> and the myogenic factors are known to recruit histone acetyltransferase  activity  <cit>  and therefore their binding and action at the des promoter and enhancer elements could produce the peak of h <dig> acetylation that we observe at this region.

interestingly, unfused myoblasts and fused myotubes displayed similar histone modification and dna methylation patterns across the des locus. this implies that an open chromatin region already exists in unfused myoblasts although they exhibit a lower level of des expression. therefore, the histone acetylation seen in myoblasts may have been established at an earlier time point before myoblast differentiation. consequently, the increase of des expression observed in myotubes could result from an enhancement in transcription factor binding activity rather than a change in overall chromatin architecture. the only significant difference between myoblast and myotube modification patterns that we observed was in histone methylation at des 3' of the first exon where in fused myotubes the levels of h3k4me <dig> and me <dig> are 20– <dig> fold higher than in the myoblasts . this implies an increase in the levels of histone methyltransferase  activity across des coupled with an increase of transcription.

dna methylation analysis of the lcr showed that hs <dig> was unmethylated in skeletal muscle cells compared to pbmcs whereas hs <dig> and hs <dig> both contained methylated cpg sites even within the muscle cell samples . interestingly, the mapped hs <dig> site lies within an alu repeat element  which is also gc rich and may explain why this hs site is methylated. it has also been shown that the density of cpg dinucleotides is directly linked to their methylation state and that a low density of methylated cpg sites does not perturb transcription  <cit> . therefore, in the case of hs <dig> which has a relatively small number of cpg sites their methylation status may not be relevant to its function.

histone h3k27me <dig> has been correlated with inactive genes  <cit> . here we show that, h3k27me <dig> marks the cpg island of des only in non-expressing pbmcs  and this could constitute a mechanism by which the dna at the cpg island promoter of des remains unmethylated but inactive in all cells types except muscle. there are extensive genome wide studies on the histone patterns across genes and regulatory elements  <cit> . our results are in concordance with previous genome wide analysis in particular h3k4me <dig> preferentially marking the des tss and h3k4me <dig> being more dominant at its regulatory element, the lcr. in addition, our data appear to be typical for complex regulatory elements of this type  <cit> . however, genome wide studies in the cell types used would not have illustrated the histone modification pattern across the muscle-specific des locus, therefore our analysis shows the importance of using the appropriate cell type when analysing a tissue specific locus.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together these findings show that the des gene cluster lies within a hyperacetylated transcriptionally competent muscle specific gene domain and that h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> mark the lcr in different distributions. in addition, h3k27me <dig> may contribute to the silencing of tissue-specific methylation-free cpg islands in non-expressing tissues. these observations provide insight into the important elements such as hs <dig> within the des lcr and highlight the significance of also investigating the underlying dna methylation pattern when examining chromatin structure at any given gene locus.
