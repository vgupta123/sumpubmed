BACKGROUND
tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand  is a potent anticancer therapeutic agent that induces apoptotic cell death in cancer cells  <cit> , regardless of p <dig> status. trail is therefore a promising cancer therapeutic agent, especially for chemotherapy- or radiotherapy-resistant cancer cells  <cit> . preclinical studies in mice and nonhuman primates with soluble forms of recombinant trail  have shown strong tumoricidal activity in xenografted tumor models without apparent toxic side effects  <cit> . however, certain trail preparations have been shown to be toxic to human hepatocytes and keratinocytes, which may be responsible for the considerable hepatotoxicity or fulminant hepatic failure observed in human trials  <cit> . in addition, trail resistance has been observed in many cancer cells  <cit> . thus, understanding the exact molecular determinants of trail resistance and developing strategies to overcome such resistance without killing normal cells are extremely important prerequisites for the successful deployment of trail as a therapeutic agent.

several different kinds of chemotherapy drugs are used in combination with trail to sensitize trail-resistant cancer cells, and many reports have combined recombinant trail with standard anticancer therapies to induce synergistic tumor cell apoptosis  <cit> . however, there is evidence that some normal human cells are sensitive to apoptosis after treatment by trail in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs  <cit> . furthermore, mutation or deletion of p <dig> occurs in more than half of all human tumors, and akt is frequently hyperactive in cancer cells. both of these alterations play a prominent role in cell resistance to chemoradiotherapy. edwin et al.  <cit>  reported a recombinant fusion protein, single-chain variable fragment  <dig> :strail, that combined the tumoricidal effect of epidermal growth factor receptor signal inhibition with target cell-restricted apoptosis induction, hence showing promising antitumor activity. thus, in recent years, biological mechanism-based cancer therapeutic strategies that may exert enhanced antitumor activity and high tumor specificity have attracted much more attention because of the unfavorable side effects of chemoradiotherapy and the resistance of many tumor cells to chemo- or radiotherapy  <cit> .

antioxidants have long been used for the treatment of cancer, especially in combination with other anticancer drugs  <cit> . superoxide dismutase  is a type of potent antioxidant enzyme that suppresses the growth of various cancer cells by removing superoxide radicals   <cit> , which are critical in different stages of carcinogenesis. however, owing to its large molecular weight, sod cannot enter the cell to exert its effects. to overcome this deficiency, a liposome can be used to enclose sod, allowing it to enter cells  <cit> . additionally, we have previously shown that a fusion of sod with scfv was able to permeate the cell membrane via receptor-mediated endocytosis and was able to then inhibit cell proliferation through the akt/p27kip <dig> pathway  <cit> . however, neither of these approaches effectively inhibits cancer cell proliferation, and therefore engineering sod to permeate the cell membrane and exercise its powerful cytotoxic effects is key to its clinical application.

akt regulates the transactivation of antiapoptotic molecules such as cellular flice-inhibitory protein , x-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and the antiapoptotic protein b-cell lymphoma-extra large   <cit> . furthermore, akt is dephosphorylated at thr <dig>  at reduced levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species   <cit> , making sod an attractive therapeutic agent for sensitizing cancer cells to trail-induced apoptosis. because trail can be internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis  <cit> , we hypothesized that iron superoxide dismutase  could be internalized with strail to reduce the level of intracellular o2-. here we cloned and coexpressed strail  and fesod, as well as a fusion protein containing both, to determine whether the resultant fused protein possessed dual activity and could exert a synergistic effect on cancer cells. we observed strail:fesod to engage the trail receptors , resulting in internalization of the receptor and ligand. once inside the cell, strail:fesod scavenged intracellular o2-, which then influenced the trail-induced apoptosis pathway.

RESULTS
production of strail:fesod
after addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside , the expected proteins strail , enzymatic activity deficient form of fused protein   and strail:fesod  were recovered as demonstrated by western blot analysis with an anti-trail antibody . the strail:fesod and strail:mfesod proteins were expressed in inclusion bodies and required refolding to regain activity. the trimeric structure is the basis of strail-induced apoptotic function. to determine whether the fesod domain changes the oligomerization state of strail, renatured strail:fesod was collected and run over a sephadex g- <dig> column . the renatured proteins were identified to be homogeneous . renatured strail:fesod was further shown to be trimeric by performing native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  western blot analysis . sod activity assays indicated that the antioxidant activity of renatured strail:fesod was  <dig>  u/mg, whereas that of natural nostoc commune fesod was  <dig>  u/mg. strail:mfesod show no antioxidant activity. the induction of apoptosis in trail-sensitive lo <dig> cells indicated strail activity. to exclude the effects of fesod, the lo <dig> cells were incubated in rpmi  <dig> medium with  <dig>  m sucrose, a condition in which internalization was inhibited   <cit> . the strail activity assay results are shown in figure 1c. lo <dig> cells treated in hyperosmotic medium with  <dig> ng/ml strail showed a  <dig> % cell death rate, whereas strail:fesod and strail:mfesod treated with  <dig>  ng/ml strail had cell death rates of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.

sensitization of k <dig> and hl- <dig> cell lines to strail:fesod
as described above, many tumor cells are resistant to trail because of phosphorylated akt  upregulation. recently, we discovered that fesod can downregulate the levels of p-akt  <cit> , and therefore we were interested in determining whether fesod could cooperate with trail to enhance the killing of tumor cells. to address this question, the trail-resistant erythroleukemia  cells and human promyelocytic leukemia  cells  <cit>  were used to detect the antitumor ability of strail:fesod. compared with strail:mfesod or strail, k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells demonstrated significantly less viability after treatment with strail:fesod, and their antitumor activity increased significantly in a strail:fesod dose-dependent manner. the decrease in cell viability was ascribed to apoptosis as demonstrated by anti-annexin v antibody and propidium iodide  staining , strongly suggesting that strail and fesod synergistically induced apoptosis in the trail-resistant k <dig> and hl- <dig> tumor cells. in contrast to the effect in these two cell lines, strail:fesod did not sensitize freshly isolated peripheral blood t cells to death induced by apoptosis . as trail induces apoptosis in normal human hepatocytes, the lo <dig> cells were also treated as a control group. interestingly, the lo <dig> cells, which are extremely sensitive to trail-induced apoptosis  <cit> , were less sensitive to strail:fesod .

rapid internalization of strail:fesod
the ability of strail:fesod to enter the cell is the basis for the synergistic effect of strail and fesod. after incubation with labeled strail:fesod for  <dig> minutes, the k <dig> cells began to show fluorescence . internalization increased at  <dig> minutes  with marked fluorescence and fluorescence was even stronger by  <dig> minutes . as the cell surface-associated ligand was stripped by acid washing, the internal fluorescence of the cells could be determined. uptake of strail:fesod was completely blocked by hypertonic medium in lo <dig> cells . quantitative data detected by flow cytometry indicated internalization rates for fesod, strail:mfesod and strail:fesod of  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . internalization of strail:fesod in hl- <dig> and lo <dig> cells, which underwent the same treatment processes as did the k <dig> cells, were confirmed by lscm. however, normal t cells showed low fluorescence signals, which may be related to the minimal expression of trail death receptors  <cit>  .

strail:fesod neutralizes free radical o2- and reduces ros
sod is a potent antiradical enzyme, and akt activity can be downregulated under low levels of ros. to investigate the intracellular antioxidant activity of strail:fesod, we measured ros levels using the oxidation-sensitive fluorescent dyes dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate   and dihydroethidium  . the o2- and ros levels in leukemia cells decreased significantly after pretreatment with strail:fesod . however, in contrast to the phosphate-buffered saline  control, pretreatment with strail:mfesod or fesod did not cause a significant difference in these roles, ruling out a role for strail in o2- quenching and confirming the low permeability of sod.

sod is well known to induce h2o <dig> production during o2- scavenging, and therefore we monitored the changes in h2o <dig>  o2-, ros and glutathione  levels after treating the cells with strail:fesod. as shown in figures 3c to 3f, h2o <dig> levels increased  <dig> or  <dig> hours after administration of strail:fesod in k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells in comparison with the levels in lo <dig> and t cells. however, at  <dig> hours after treatment, we observed that h2o <dig> levels had declined almost to normal levels. as compared with strail:mfesod, strail:fesod induced a notably more significant decrease in cellular ros and o2- fluorescence intensities and a marked rise in gsh levels in the k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells . figure 3g shows that the redox status in lo <dig> cells changed, but not as strongly as they did in the cancer cells or in the strail:mfesod-treated lo <dig> cells. as shown in figure 3h, normal t cells maintained a stable redox status, which may explain why they did not undergo strail:fesod-induced apoptosis. figure 3i shows that strail:mfesod-induced apoptosis in lo <dig> cells was accompanied by a rapid increase in ros levels. the graph also shows that  <dig> hours after strail:fesod treatment in the two leukemia cell lines, ros levels did not increase along with the decrease in h2o <dig>  suggesting that h2o <dig> was broken down by the cellular antioxidant defenses rather than giving rise to highly reactive hydroxyl radicals  <cit> .

strail:fesod-induced apoptosis does not involve the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway
one parameter that is altered by the ros production is mitochondrial membrane potential , and cancer cells display a strong resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, which is probably due to their efficacious protection against the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. to examine the role of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells undergoing strail:fesod-induced apoptosis, ΔΨm was analyzed by flow cytometry. figures 4a and 4b show an increase in rhodamine <dig>  and jc- <dig> fluorescence intensity in all four cell lines except the normal t cells after treatment with strail:fesod, indicating that the mitochondria remained polarized during apoptosis in k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells. the lack of a significant change in rh <dig> and jc- <dig> fluorescence intensity in normal t cells may be related to the stable redox status . the data shown in figure 4c imply that low levels of ros and high levels of gsh maintain the ΔΨm and that hyperpolarized mitochondria can reduce ros to a lower level. cytochrome c release did not occur during strail:fesod-induced apoptosis . lo <dig> are type ii cells, and strail was able to apoptose the lo <dig> cells in the presence of mitochondrial dysfunction .

strail:fesod-induced death is dependent on caspase-8
a common feature of cell death through apoptosis is the activation of caspases. the inhibition of caspase- <dig> expression effectively protected k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells from strail:fesod-induced apoptosis . this result indicates that strail:fesod-induced apoptosis is dependent on caspase activation and that caspase- <dig> acts as the major initiator caspase in strail:fesod-induced apoptosis in these cells . in contrast, decreased expression of caspase- <dig> did not significantly suppress strail:fesod-induced apoptosis in the leukemia cells , suggesting the apoptosis to be caspase-9-independent. changes in caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig> activity in the two leukemia cell lines were markedly greater than those in the lo <dig> and t cells , mirroring the different fate of the four cell lines after treatment with strail:fesod. in contrast to the control, there was no obvious change in caspase- <dig> activity in any of the four cell types.

the internalization of fesod is indispensable for strail:fesod-induced apoptosis
first, we examined the expression of trail receptors and whether treatment with strail:fesod led to elevated surface expression of dr <dig> and dr <dig>  no major differences were found in the expression of either dr <dig> or dr <dig> after  <dig> hours of strail:fesod treatment . to determine which receptor is involved in the death induced by strail:fesod and to discern whether the uptake of strail:fesod is receptor-dependent, we then performed an experiment in which we added blocking antibodies against dr <dig> and/or dr <dig> for  <dig>  hours prior to strail:fesod exposure  <cit> . figure 5g shows that blocking with dr <dig> or dr <dig> antibody partially protected the k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells from cell death, whereas the antibody against dr <dig> had a more pronounced protective effect on strail:fesod-induced apoptosis than did the antibody against dr <dig>  no significant apoptosis was noted when blocking with both anti-trail receptor antibodies. these results indicate that the strail:fesod-induced death signaling in the two cell lines depends on dr <dig> and dr <dig>  after blocking with antibodies against dr <dig> and/or dr <dig>  the internalization of the fusion protein mirrored the apoptosis results, showing death receptor dependence. there was minimal uptake of strail:fesod when pretreated with both anti-trail receptor antibodies , demonstrating the endocytosis to be receptor-mediated.

to provide evidence for the synergistic effect of strail and fesod, k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells were treated in hypertonic medium containing strail:fesod, conditions under which internalization of fesod was inhibited. figure 5g shows that the strail:fesod-induced apoptosis drastically declined in the hypertonic medium, demonstrating fesod to be indispensable for strail:fesod-induced apoptosis. the confirmed internalization of strail:mfesod into k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells  and the indistinguishable cell death in the two cell lines after treatment with strail:mfesod  further prove the necessity for fesod to be internalized to allow for strail:fesod-induced apoptosis.

a brief accumulation of h2o <dig> is involved in strail:fesod-induced apoptosis
we observed that the elevated h2o <dig> levels lasted about  <dig> hours in k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells after treatment with strail:fesod . h2o <dig> has been reported to have a direct effect on caspase- <dig> activation, and therefore we investigated whether h2o <dig> was involved in strail:fesod-induced apoptosis. to that end, cells were treated with strail:fesod in the presence or absence of n-acetylcysteine   <cit> . after pretreatment with strail:fesod for  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> hours, the addition of nac partially reduced strail:fesod-induced apoptosis . when the cells were pretreated with strail:fesod for more than  <dig> hours, nac did not show any significant inhibitory effect on strail:fesod-induced cell death. thus, the results indicate that the production of h2o <dig> during o2- scavenging contributed to strail:fesod-induced apoptosis and that caspase- <dig> activation by h2o <dig> occur within the first  <dig> hours after strail:fesod treatment. to further assess the role of h2o <dig> produced during o2- scavenging in strail:fesod-induced apoptosis, we examined the apoptosis induced by strail:fesod after eliminating intracellular o2- by pretreating hl- <dig> and k <dig> cells with nac for  <dig> hours . because of the prescavenging of o2-, there was little substrate for fesod, which caused the h2o <dig> to remain at a very low level during the treatment with strail:fesod. figure 5i shows that cell death was reduced. these data suggest that h2o <dig> plays an important role in strail:fesod-induced apoptosis.

downregulation of p-akt and c-flipl promotes trail-induced apoptosis in hl- <dig> and k <dig> cells
it is known that p-akt can be activated by ros and that elevated akt activity protects cells against trail-induced apoptosis. figure 5h shows that decreased h2o <dig> levels did not entirely inhibit strail:fesod-induced apoptosis. thus, we postulated that akt may also be involved in strail:fesod-induced apoptosis in k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells. p-akt was rapidly dephosphorylated within  <dig> minutes of adding strail:fesod without changing the akt protein level, and strail:fesod treatment markedly depressed the c-flipl level in the two leukemia cell lines . c-flips was not detected in the hl- <dig> cells . c-flips was detected in k <dig> cells, but did not show any change in expression levels after strail:fesod addition . therefore, we hypothesize that c-flipl is involved in strail:fesod-induced apoptosis. strail:fesod-induced apoptosis in k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells was partially inhibited by c-flipl overexpression , demonstrating that the p-akt/c-flipl signaling pathway is also involved in strail:fesod-induced apoptosis. the effect of strail:fesod on the downregulation of c-flipl was also determined in cells in which total caspases were blocked , further proving that c-flipl levels were modulated by akt. bcl- <dig> family proteins are important pro- and antiapoptotic proteins in the cells, but we were unable to detect any changes in bcl- <dig>  bcl-xl and bax levels or bid cleavage after  <dig> hours of strail:fesod treatment.

low levels of h2o <dig> protect lo <dig> cells from strail:fesod-induced apoptosis
the downregulation of p-akt and c-flipl was also observed in lo <dig> cells , but not in normal t cells . it was not immediately apparent why trail sensitivity did not occur in lo <dig> cells. lo <dig> cells are type ii, and trail-induced apoptosis can be blocked by caspase- <dig> inhibition in these cells . the results presented in figure 3i and figures 4a and 4b also suggest that strail-induced apoptosis in lo <dig> cells was dependent on mitochondria. caspase- <dig> activity was low, and mitochondria remained polarized after treatment with strail:fesod, which inhibits the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. therefore, we hypothesized that the low levels of h2o <dig> prevented strail:fesod from converting lo <dig> into type i cells, which are characterized by high caspase- <dig> activity. to test this hypothesis, rna interference transfection was performed to depress catalase expression in the lo <dig> cells, and the h2o <dig> levels were found to be much higher than those in the control group after treatment with strail:fesod . high caspase- <dig> activity and apoptosis were induced by strail:fesod  in the catalase-deficient lo <dig> cells. on the basis of these experimental data, lo <dig> cells are not converted into type i cells after treatment with strail:fesod. on the contrary, strail:fesod not only depressed caspase- <dig> activity but also maintained caspase- <dig> activity below a critical threshold because of the low h2o <dig> levels, rendering the lo <dig> cells insensitive to strail:fesod-induced apoptosis. thus, without the accumulation of h2o <dig>  downregulation of p-akt and c-flipl was insufficient to activate enough caspase- <dig> to sensitize lo <dig> to trail-induced apoptosis at a low level of oxidative stress.

discussion
here we describe a novel therapeutic approach for treating cancer using the new cell-permeable fusion protein strail:fesod. the effects of strail and strail:fesod on apoptosis in lo <dig> cells in hyperosmotic medium did not show significant differences, suggesting that the fesod domain does not change the oligomerization state of strail . when engaging the trail receptors , the trimeric strail:fesod triggered the trail-induced apoptotic signaling pathway and simultaneously permeated the cell membrane via the receptor-mediated endocytic pathway. movement throughout the cytoplasm provided fesod with the opportunity to scavenge o2- originating from the mitochondria. once strail:fesod engaged the trail receptors, trail-induced apoptosis signaling was triggered, seemingly prior to the elimination of intracellular o2-. however, in the current study, the brief accumulation of h2o <dig> and the downregulation of p-akt occurred rapidly enough to enhance the sensitivity of k <dig> and hl- <dig> cancer cells to trail-induced apoptosis. the internalization of strail:fesod was rapid  and triggered trail-induced apoptosis signaling and the elimination of intracellular o2- to occur nearly simultaneously. in addition, it has been suggested that fas-associated protein with death domain and caspase- <dig> are not recruited soon enough because of the long delay in death-inducing signaling complex assembly in type ii cells  <cit> . thus, fesod had sufficient time to scavenge intracellular o2- and then influence the course of trail-induced apoptosis.

the inhibition of h2o <dig> accumulation or the overexpression of c-flipl partially suppressed strail:fesod-induced apoptosis, and thus we infer that h2o <dig> and p-akt affect caspase- <dig> activity via different pathways. constitutive phosphoinositide 3-kinase /akt activity has been demonstrated to be one of the most effective antiapoptotic survival pathways in trail-resistant cells, and therefore decreasing p-akt levels is an important mechanism of averting trail resistance. tumor cells containing an activating somatic mutation in pi3k are relatively resistant to trail-induced apoptosis  <cit> . after treatment with strail:fesod, p-akt was downregulated in three cell lines , depressing c-flipl expression  <cit> . however, the lo <dig> cells responded little to the fusion protein, in contrast to the synergistic apoptosis in trail-resistant k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells  <cit> . the downregulation of akt activity by ly <dig> promoted trail cytotoxicity in lo <dig> cells , implying that low oxidative stress induced by fesod inhibited trail-induced apoptosis in the lo <dig> cells. the results of the present study suggest that differences in caspase- <dig> activity determine the different cellular effects of strail:fesod on the indicated cells based on the interruption of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway . ros have been reported to regulate caspase activation in trail-resistant human colon carcinoma cells  <cit> . perez-cruz et al.  <cit>  indicated that intracellular vitamin c can quench some of these ros, reducing caspase- <dig> activation, similar to what we observed in the lo <dig> cells. however, fas et al.  <cit>  found that wogonin sensitizes resistant malignant cells to trail by shifting levels of the trail-induced free radical o2-, consistent with our results demonstrating the sensitization of k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells.

ros levels have been found to be significantly higher in cancer cells than in normal cells, and the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase, catalase and sod has been shown to be significantly lower in cancer patients than in controls  <cit> . the higher ros levels and lower antioxidant enzyme activities  make the transient burst of h2o <dig> possible in k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells; however, because of the lower ros levels and vigorous antioxidant system, the brief accumulation of h2o <dig> was not detected in lo <dig> cells . the brief accumulation of h2o <dig> during o2- scavenging was involved in the strail:fesod-induced apoptosis in k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells , possibly exerting a direct effect on caspase- <dig> activation  <cit> . the low h2o <dig> levels protected lo <dig> cells from strail:fesod-induced apoptosis . normal t cells produced very little ros, and therefore only a small shift in redox state was seen, which may explain why strail:fesod did not sensitize normal t cells to undergo apoptosis. our studies reveal that strail:fesod reduces the level of intracellular o2-, with two results: the downregulation of p-akt arising from a low level of o2- and the transitory accumulation of h2o <dig>  both of which may increase the amount of available active caspase- <dig>  <cit> . however, a low level of o2-, impairing caspase- <dig> activation  <cit> , and stable mitochondria may inhibit apoptosis. thus, we infer that the relative ratio of these opposing effects described above determines the sensitivity of a cell to strail:fesod and that this relative ratio may be associated with the cell type and the level of o2-. without the accumulation of h2o <dig>  the available activated caspase- <dig> was insufficient . at the same time, caspase- <dig> activity was inhibited , which means that the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was interrupted. thus, strail:fesod cannot sensitize lo <dig> cells to apoptosis when there is insufficient activated caspase- <dig> to excite the downstream apoptotic pathway in the absence of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. the induction of apoptosis in k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells implies that the net result of intracellular o2- scavenging by strail:fesod is the presence of a critical amount of activated caspase- <dig>  thus, in environments of low-level oxidative stress, the cellular context may influence the relative ratio of the opposing effects and subsequently determine whether this low level of oxidative stress favors apoptosis or survival.

because of the effective protection against the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway mediated by the increased expression of bcl-xl and the mutation of caspase- <dig>  k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells exhibit strong resistance to chemotherapeutic agents  <cit> . however, after treatment with strail:fesod, k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells undergoing apoptosis retained their ΔΨm , and we also failed to detect a difference in the expression level of bcl- <dig>  bax, bid or bcl-xl  or a change in the distribution of cytochrome c . the unchanged pattern of cytochrome c localization may be associated with a decrease in ros levels, leading to mitochondrial stability. depressed caspase- <dig> expression did not suppress apoptosis, demonstrating that strail:fesod-induced apoptosis was independent of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells . mohr et al.  <cit>  indicated that high levels of mnsod protect colorectal cancer cells from trail-induced apoptosis by inhibition of smac/diablo release. however, this effect may be limited to type ii cells, in which death receptor-mediated apoptosis is dependent on mitochondria. in contrast, in the present study, treatment with strail:fesod caused k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells to convert to type i cells and to apoptose independently of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, consistent with the effects of erythroid differentiation  <cit> . thus, mitochondrial hyperpolarization does not delay apoptosis when a critical amount of caspase- <dig> has been activated, which may be the mechanism that regulates type i cell apoptosis independently of the mitochondrial signaling pathway  <cit> .

death receptors are expressed in liver tissue as well as in isolated hepatocytes  <cit> , and for this reason strail:fesod was able to permeate the cell membrane and reduce the oxidative stress in lo <dig> cells without causing cytotoxicity. maintaining the balance of opposing effects is important when treating normal cells with strail:fesod, because an appropriate ros level is extremely important for preserving vital cellular and biochemical functions. our future work will focus on the task of estimating intracellular ros production in an individual cell to determine a treatment dose that maintains ros levels at an appropriate interval, killing cancer cells without inducing normal cell death. in light of the different sensitivities of different cell types to ros and the hypersensitivity of tumor cells to decreased levels of ros relative to normal cells, the ability to control trail cytotoxicity through the regulation of intracellular ros levels will be a breakthrough in the utilization of trail. undoubtedly, strail:fesod is a good potential therapeutic choice.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our research has shown that a cell-permeable fusion protein, strail:fesod, selectively sensitized k <dig> and hl- <dig> cancer cells to trail-induced apoptosis but did not sensitize normal human hepatocytes  or t cells. strail:fesod is a potent antioxidant that produces h2o <dig> during intracellular o2- scavenging and downregulates p-akt and c-flipl. thus, strail:fesod enhances trail-induced apoptosis in leukemia cells and, at the same time, avoids the negative effects of high levels of ros. after treatment with strail:fesod, the mitochondria were still intact, and the trail-resistant k <dig> and hl- <dig> cells successfully converted into type i cells. in addition, the downregulation of c-flipl was not sufficient to sensitize lo <dig> to trail-induced apoptosis without h2o <dig> accumulation. these data suggest that strail:fesod can serve as a promising pharmaceutical agent for the treatment of leukemia.
