BACKGROUND
a transcriptional regulatory module  is a set of genes that is regulated by a common set of tfs. by organizing the genome into trms, a living cell can coordinate the activities of many genes and carry out complex functions. therefore, identifying trms is useful for understanding cellular responses to internal and external signals. the advances of high-throughput genomic tools such as dna microarray  <cit>  and chromatin immunoprecipitation-dna chip   <cit>  have made the computational reconstruction of trms of a eukaryotic cell possible.

genome-wide gene expression analysis has been used to investigate trms controlling a variety of cellular processes in yeast  <cit> . clustering and motif-discovering algorithms have been applied to gene expression data to find sets of co-regulated genes and have identified plausible binding motifs of their tfs  <cit> . such approaches have also been expanded to incorporate previous knowledge about the genes, such as cellular functions  <cit>  or promoter sequence motifs  <cit> . moreover, some researchers used model-based approaches such as random boolean networks  <cit>  and bayesian networks  <cit>  to infer regulatory network architectures. however, this approach provides only indirect evidence of genetic regulatory interactions and does not identify the relevant tfs. on the other hand, the chip-chip technique was developed to identify physical interactions between tfs and dna regions. using chip-chip data, simon et al.  <cit>  investigated how the yeast cell-cycle gene-expression program is regulated by each of the nine major transcriptional activators. lee et al.  <cit>  constructed a network of tf-gene interactions and harbison et al.  <cit>  constructed an initial map of yeast's transcriptional regulatory code. however, chip-chip data alone cannot tell whether a tf is an activator or a repressor and, most importantly, chip-chip data are noisy and, depending on the chosen p-value cutoff, include many false positive or false negative tf-dna binding relationships.

since gene expression and chip-chip data provide complementary information, some researchers  <cit>  have integrated both types of data in their studies. however, most previous studies except the gram algorithm  <cit>  assumed that a gene is regulated by a tf only if the p-value of tf-gene binding in the chip-chip data is ≤  <dig> , thus suffering a false negative rate of ~24% in determining tf-gene binding  <cit> .

in order to reduce the high false negative rate, we develop a method, called temporal relationship identification algorithm , that uses the information provided by gene expression data to alleviate the effect of using a stringent threshold in determining tf-gene binding. a tf-gene pair is said to have a positively  temporal relationship if the gene's expression profile is positively  correlated with the tf's regulatory profile possibly with time lags . tria identifies tf-gene pairs with a temporal relationship. we define that a tf binds to a specific gene if  the p-value for the tf to bind the gene is ≤  <dig>  in the chip-chip data or   <dig>  <p ≤  <dig>  and the tf-gene pair has a temporal relationship. that is, we allow the p-value cutoff to be relaxed to  <dig>  if the tf-gene pair has a temporal relationship. our approach is different from the gram algorithm  <cit> , which relied on sets of co-expressed gene to relax the stringent p-value cutoff.

from the above procedure, we derive a binding score matrix. then we develop the module finding algorithm  that combines this binding score matrix with the gene expression matrix to reconstruct trms of the yeast cell cycle . for each of the five cell cycle phases , mofa exhaustively searches for all possible tf combinations and find their target genes. once the set of target genes to which a common set of tfs bind is inferred, mofa identifies a subset of these target genes whose gene expression profiles are positively correlated possibly with time lags. that is, the genes of a module not only share a common set of tfs but also have positively  correlated expression profiles. our gene module is more general than that of gram algorithm  <cit> , which only searched co-expressed genes to form a module. mofa reconstructs  <dig> trms. we then validate the biological relevance of each inferred trm using existing experimental data, enrichment for genes in the same mips functional category  <cit> , known dna-binding motifs  <cit> , etc.

RESULTS
by integrating the gene expression and chip-chip data, mofa identified  <dig> trms, which together contain  <dig> distinct genes regulated by  <dig> distinct tfs . in the literature  <cit> ,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes and  <dig> of the  <dig> tfs are known to be involved in the cell cycle.

validation of the identified modules
analysis of the identified modules suggests that mofa identifies biologically relevant groups of genes. first,  <dig> of the  <dig> modules contain genes that are known to be involved in the cell cycle . second, 51%  identified module includes groups of genes that function in the same cellular process: each of these modules contains at least one over-represented mips functional category with adjusted p-value <  <dig>   using the cumulative hypergeometric distribution . third, the modules are generally accurate in assigning tfs to sets of genes whose functions are consistent with the tfs' known roles. we found that the regulatory functions of the 71%  tfs are consistent with one of their modules' over-represented mips functional categories with adjusted p-value <  <dig>  . as an example, dig <dig> and ste <dig> are known to regulate mating and pseudohyphal growth  <cit>  and m/g <dig> is the critical phase for these processes. all five genes  of the {ste <dig>  dig1} module are important for mating, pseudophyphal growth, or pheromone response. fourth, 33%  genes are known by previous studies to be regulated by at least one of the tfs that we assigned to the module . fifth, the genes of a module usually have the same binding motifs of the important cell cycle tfs such as scb , mcb , sff , ecb  and swi <dig> . we found that in the majority of cases  in which a module is controlled by at least one of the important cell cycle tfs , there always exist genes that have the known binding motifs of the corresponding tfs . finally, in most cases in which a module is controlled by more than one tf, there is evidence that these tfs may interact physically or functionally . about 59%  of the tf interactions that we identified have been experimentally proven or identified by computational algorithms  <cit> . taken together, these results provide evidence that mofa identifies not only sets of biologically related genes, but also tfs that individually or cooperatively control these genes.

identification of important cell cycle tfs and their combinations
mofa identified  <dig> tfs that regulate genes of the yeast cell cycle and figure  <dig> shows the cell cycle phases in which these tfs carry out their regulatory functions. table  <dig> lists these  <dig> tfs according to the number of target genes. the nine well-known cell cycle tfs  are ranked within the top  <dig>  suggesting the effectiveness of mofa to find important cell cycle tfs. moreover, we found another  <dig> tfs  that are relative to the cell cycle process, consistent with the previous studies  <cit> . the remaining  <dig> tfs  are putative cell cycle related tfs. among them, hap <dig> is more plausible than the others to be related to the cell cycle process since the number of cell cycle genes that it regulates is much larger than that of the others . actually, it has been shown that hap <dig>  regulates ape <dig>  <cit> . ape <dig> is a dual function enzyme and its cell cycle-dependent expression might affect both dna repair and the activity of various transcription factors as a function of the cell cycle  <cit> . this evidence validates that mofa has the ability to find novel tfs which may play a role in the cell cycle or are involved in other cellular processes that have crosstalk with the cell cycle process.

nine well-known cell cycle tfs are bold-faced and another  <dig> tfs that are also involved in the cell cycle  <cit>  are in italic type. the tfs are ordered by the number of their target genes in all phases.

tf combinations and their target genes that are important for each cell cycle phase are also found. we found that different combinations of a fairly small number of tfs are responsible for regulating a large number of genes in different cell cycle phases. detailed discussions of the tf combinations and their target genes in each specific cell cycle phase are given below.

the m/g <dig> phase
ace <dig> and swi <dig> have been shown to control certain genes expressed in m/g <dig>  <cit> . we successfully found that {ace <dig>  swi5} and {swi5} regulate, respectively, modules  <dig> and  <dig> in m/g <dig>  both ace <dig> and swi <dig> were found to regulate egt <dig>  whose product is involved in cell wall biogenesis and cytokinesis. swi <dig> also regulates pcl <dig>  whose product is the only cyclin known to act in m/g <dig>  <cit>  and sic <dig>  whose product is a cyclin regulator that inhibits the cdc28-clb kinase activity. furthermore, swi <dig> regulates several y' genes, which are a subgroup of a larger group of sub-telomeric genes that share dna sequence similarity and whose expression peaks in early g <dig>  <cit> .

it is known that in the absence of ndd <dig> and fkh <dig>  mcm <dig> participates in the regulation of genes essential for cellular functions specific to late mitosis and early g <dig>  <cit> . indeed, we found that {mcm1} regulates module  <dig> in m/g <dig>  it regulates cdc <dig>  which encodes a protein involved in pre-replication complex formation and aga <dig>  which involves in mating. in addition, yox <dig> was recently characterized as a binding partner of mcm <dig> in m/g <dig>  <cit> . we found that {yox1}, acting as a repressor, regulates module  <dig> in m/g <dig>  three genes cdc <dig>  pig <dig> and yor066w are found to be regulated by both mcm <dig> and yox <dig>  confirming that yox <dig> and mcm <dig> may co-regulate a group of genes.

in addition, some cell-wall genes are known to be under the control of the m-phase regulator mcm <dig> or the g1-phase regulator sbf. the m/g <dig> phase is a crucial time for cell wall synthesis because the bud separates from the mother right after the m/g <dig> phase. we successfully found tf combinations {mcm1} and {swi <dig>  swi6}, whose common target genes include swi <dig>  which encodes a late g <dig> tf, and utr <dig>  which is involved in cell-wall organization and polarized growth. the dual regulation of swi <dig> by mcm <dig> and swi <dig> has been shown previously  <cit> .

we identified {dig <dig>  ste12} to regulate module  <dig> in m/g <dig>  the genes of this module include fus <dig>  gpa <dig>  kar <dig>  sst <dig>  and tec <dig>  which are important for mating or pseudohyphal growth. dig <dig> and ste <dig> are known to regulate mating and pseudohyphal growth  <cit> , supporting the biological relevance of our finding. we also found novel tf combinations. for example, {dat <dig>  gat <dig>  msn <dig>  pdr <dig>  yap5} is identified to regulate a group of genes that are similar to sub-telomerically encoded proteins.

the g <dig> phase
previous molecular and genetic analysis suggested that sbf and mbf are important activators of genes essential for cellular functions specific to late g <dig>  <cit> . our result confirms this model:  <dig> out of the  <dig> modules in g <dig> are regulated by mbf or sbf. sbf regulates bud <dig>  exg <dig> , gas <dig>  mnn <dig>  och <dig> and psa <dig> . these genes are involved in the morphological changes associated with cell budding. mbf controls pds <dig>  rad <dig>  rnr <dig> , dun <dig>  irr <dig> and rad <dig> . these genes are involved in dna replication and repair. moreover, the targets of sbf and mbf also include key cell cycle regulators. both sbf and mbf were found to regulate cln <dig>  clb <dig>  and pcl <dig> . in addition, sbf regulates pcl <dig>  and mbf regulates clb <dig> .

we found that stb <dig> together with sbf  or mbf  regulates modules  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in g <dig>  it has been known that stb <dig> binds to swi <dig> in vitro and is thought to interact with swi <dig>  a subunit of both sbf and mbf, to regulate transcription in vivo  <cit> . also, consistent with our results, kato et al.  <cit>  claimed the presence of the complexes stb1+swi6+swi <dig> and stb1+swi6+mbp <dig>  moreover, we found that {ste <dig>  swi <dig>  swi6} regulates module  <dig> in g <dig>  which is also consistent with the result of  <cit> .

we found that fkh1/fkh <dig> combines with mbf/sbf to regulate modules  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in g <dig>  it is known that fkh <dig> and fkh <dig> regulate genes expressed in g2/m and also genes expressed in other cell cycle phases  <cit> , supporting our result. we also found some novel tf combinations. for example, {dat <dig>  gat <dig>  msn <dig>  pdr <dig>  yap5}, which is also found in m/g <dig>  {gat <dig>  hap <dig>  pdr <dig>  yap5}, {dat <dig>  hap <dig>  yap5}, {gat <dig>  rap <dig>  yap5}, {gal <dig>  yap5} and {msn4} are all identified to regulate genes whose products are similar to sub-telomerically encoded proteins. all these genes share dna sequence similarity and are found in y' elements, which are located at chromosomes ends  <cit> .

the s phase
we found that {fkh2} regulates various genes that encode proteins associated with chromatin structure including histone genes hhf <dig> and hht <dig> . we found that {fkh1} regulates tel <dig> , a telomere length regulator, and arp <dig> , a subunit of the chromatin remodeling swi/snf complex. histone genes can be found in the {fkh1}, {fkh2}, {swi <dig>  swi6} and {mbp <dig>  swi4} modules, suggesting that sbf, fkh <dig> and fkh <dig> probably regulate histone genes. our result is consistent with a few genomic studies  <cit>  that indicated the involvement of sbf and fkh1/fkh <dig> in regulating s phase genes. in addition, we successfully identified {hir <dig>  hir <dig>  hir3} to regulate six histone genes  of module  <dig> in the s phase, supported by existing experimental results  <cit> . in summary, we suggest that sbf and fkh1/fkh <dig> are activators and hir <dig>  hir <dig> and hir <dig> are repressors of histone genes.

the s/g <dig> and g2/m phases
simon et al.  <cit>  and lee et al.  <cit>  indicated the involvement of sbf and fkh1/fkh <dig> in regulating s/g <dig> genes. we confirmed that fkh <dig>  fkh <dig>  swi <dig> and swi <dig> are important tfs in this phase since five out of the eight modules in s/g <dig> are regulated by at least one of these tfs. fkh <dig>  swi <dig> and swi <dig> are identified to regulate sim <dig>  which is involved in cell cycle control, and fkh <dig> is identified to regulate clb <dig>  which encodes an s/g <dig> cyclin.

previous studies have demonstrated that mcm <dig> collaborates with ndd <dig> and fkh1/fkh <dig> to regulate genes necessary for both entry into and exit from mitosis  <cit> . we successfully identified this tf combination to regulate module  <dig> in g2/m. four of the seven genes identified in this module have an sff  or ecb  motif . the mcm1+ndd1+fkh1/fkh <dig> protein complex regulates transcription of clb <dig> , whose product is necessary to enter mitosis. furthermore, sbf and mbf regulate swe <dig>  and gin <dig> . swe <dig> is a protein kinase that regulates the g2/m transition by inhibition of cdc28-clb <dig> kinase activity and gin <dig> regulates swe <dig>  <cit> . the mcm1+ndd1+fkh1/fkh <dig> protein complex also sets the stage for exit from mitosis at several levels  <cit> . first, they regulate two key m/g <dig> tfs: swi <dig>  and ace <dig> . second, they regulate cdc <dig> , an activator of the anaphase promoting complex . finally, these activators regulate spo <dig> , which encodes a protein that regulates the mitotic exit.

it has been suggested that fkh <dig> has a more prominent role than fkh <dig> in g2/m transcription  <cit> . our analysis agrees with this suggestion since the number of g2/m genes regulated by fkh <dig> is much larger than that of fkh <dig> . we also found novel tf combinations. for example, we found that sff instead of combining with mcm <dig> can also combine with swi <dig> or yox <dig> to regulate g2/m genes and {cin <dig>  nrg <dig>  yap6} is identified to regulate a group of genes with unknown functions.

discussion
relationships between two tfs of a module
the relationships between two tfs that regulate the same module fall into three categories. first, both tfs bind dna in the same promoter region but do not interact with each other. different tfs may regulate the target gene to execute different functions in different cellular processes. indeed, we found that tfs in this category usually regulate genes that are required for multiple cellular processes. for example, we found that {ste <dig>  swi <dig>  swi6} regulates module  <dig> in g <dig>  since ste <dig> and sbf  are both dna-binding tfs and there is no evidence that ste <dig> interacts with sbf, the relationship between ste <dig> and sbf belongs to this category. ste <dig> is a regulator of the mating or pseudohyphal growth pathway and sbf is an important regulator in the g <dig> phase. this indicates that there may exist crosstalk between these two cellular processes. that is, the tf combination {ste <dig>  swi <dig>  swi6} probably regulates genes needed for the g <dig> phase and also independently needed for mating, confirming the results of  <cit> . second, both tfs bind dna and interact with each other. for example, we found that {fkh <dig>  ndd <dig>  mcm1} regulates module  <dig> in g2/m. both mcm <dig> and fkh <dig> bind dna and these two proteins together recruit ndd <dig> to form a protein complex to control the transcription of g2/m genes  <cit> . third, only one tf binds dna and the other tf regulates the target genes through binding to the dna-binding tf. for example, {mbp <dig>  swi6} and {swi <dig>  swi6} are found to regulate, respectively, modules  <dig> and  <dig> in g <dig>  mbf  functions in dna replication, and sbf  predominantly controls the expression of budding and cell-wall genes  <cit> . since swi <dig> is a non-dna-binding cofactor of swi <dig> and mbp <dig>  the relationship between swi <dig> and swi4/mbp <dig> falls into the third category.

advantages of mofa
mofa has two features that make it more powerful than current methods. first, it can reduce false negatives in determining binding events in the chip-chip data. most researchers except for bar-joseph et al.  <cit>  have chosen a relatively stringent p-value threshold  to determine binding in order to reduce false positives at the expense of false negatives  <cit> . in comparison, mofa allows the p-value cutoff to be relaxed to  <dig>  if a tf-gene pair has a temporal relationship.  as an example, consider swi <dig>  a well-characterized cell cycle tf in m/g <dig>  the {swi5} module we inferred contains  <dig> genes that have similar expression patterns . four of these genes  would not have been identified as swi <dig> targets using the stringent p-value threshold . previous studies identified these four genes as true targets of swi <dig>  <cit> . this attests to the ability of mofa to lower the rate of false negatives without substantially increasing the rate of false positives. overall,  <dig> of the  <dig> unique tf-gene interactions discovered by mofa would not have been detected using the current chip-chip data with the stringent p-value cutoff . in addition,  <dig> of the  <dig> unique tf-gene interactions are supported by gene expression data. that is, each of the  <dig> tf-gene pairs is identified to have a temporal relationship .

second, mofa can determine the role of a tf in regulating genes of a module. a tf is said to be an activator  of a module if the p-value of observing tf-gene pairs of the module having a positively  temporal relationship is ≤  <dig> . the p-value is the probability that an observation would be made by chance, and is calculated using the cumulative binomial distribution  <cit> . we found nine activators  and six repressors , consistent with the results of previous studies  <cit> . interestingly, four tfs  are capable of being activators and repressors to regulate different modules. table  <dig> provides the detailed discussion of how we assign the regulatory roles of tfs and the known experimental evidence that supports our findings.

a tf is said to be an activator/repressor of a module if the p-value of observing tf-gene pairs of the module having positively/negatively  correlated profiles is ≤  <dig> . the p-value is the probability that an observation would be made by chance, and is calculated using the cumulative binomial distribution  <cit> : p=∑x=n0npxn−x where n is the total number of genes in a module, n <dig> is the number of genes that have temporal relationships with the tf, and p is the probability of observing an arbitrary gene in the genome that has a temporal relationship with the tf.

mofa is more powerful than gram algorithm  <cit>  in two ways. first, mofa has the ability to assign a tf to be an activator or/and a repressor . on the contrary, gram algorithm cannot find any repressors or activators that are correlated with its target genes with time lags since gram algorithm regards a tf to be an activator only when the expression profiles of the tf and the genes in the corresponding module are co-expressed. for example, gram algorithm found only two  of the nine activators and none of the six repressors that are found by mofa . second, mofa is more powerful than gram algorithm to find out co-regulated genes that are not co-expressed. while gram algorithm assumed that the genes of a module are co-expressed, mofa allows the genes of a module to be positively correlated with time lags. since it is known that co-regulated genes may not be co-expressed  <cit> , the relaxation of co-expressed assumption of gram algorithm makes mofa have a better ability to reconstruct gene modules with biological relevance. for example, mofa identified four genes  as swi <dig> targets  which is supported by previous studies  <cit> . however, none of them was found by gram algorithm.

parameter settings of mofa
the choices of both the relaxed p-value and time-lag parameter have biological meanings. two previous papers  <cit>  used a statistical error model to assign a p-value of the binding relationship of a tf-gene pair. they found that if p ≤  <dig> , the binding relationship of a tf-gene pair is of high confidence and can usually be confirmed by gene-specific pcr. if p >  <dig> , the binding relationship of a tf-gene pair is of low confidence and cannot be confirmed by gene-specific pcr most of the time. however, if  <dig>  <p ≤  <dig> , the binding relationship of a tf-gene pair is ambiguous and can be confirmed by gene-specific pcr in some cases but not in the other cases. our aim is to solve this ambiguity. this is why we choose  <dig>  to be the relaxed p-value. we say that an ambiguous binding relationship of a tf-gene pair is plausible if  <dig>  <p <  <dig>  and if this tf-gene pair has a temporal relationship. as to the time-lag parameter, its value is chosen to make the maximal time lag approximately equal to two consecutive cell cycle phases because simon et al.  <cit>  found cases where a cell cycle tf that expresses in one phase of the cell cycle can regulate genes that function in the next phase.

increasing the value of the relaxed p-value or the time-lag parameter may introduce some false positive binding relationships of tf-gene pairs into the binding score matrix. on the other hand, decreasing the value of the relaxed p-value or the time-lag parameter may fail to rescue some false negative binding relationships of tf-gene pairs. a binding score matrix is used to construct an original trm and mofa refines the trm by identifying a subset of these co-regulated genes in a trm whose gene expression profiles are highly positively correlated possibly with time lags. mofa can filter out false positives to some extent because the expression profiles of false positives are unlikely by chance to be similar to those of the highly positively time-delayed correlated genes identified by mofa. as to the false negative problem, mofa cannot alleviate the harmful effect since these plausible binding relationships of tf-genes pairs are not included in the first place. that is, false negative problem is a more serious issue than the false positive problem in mofa. therefore, if users have no idea about the appropriate values of the relaxed p-value and the time-lag parameter, they should first try larger values since mofa has the ability to reduce this kind of noises.

refining clusters from spellman et al
spellman et al.  <cit>  used a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group together co-expressed genes and searched the promoters of these genes for consensus binding motifs. they tried to use these clusters to understand the transcriptional mechanisms of cell cycle regulation. their approach has some drawbacks. first, co-expressed genes are not necessarily co-regulated. second, even if the genes in a cluster are co-regulated, the relevant tfs still cannot be easily identified by the consensus binding motifs.

mofa can refine clusters in  <cit>  and provide a better understanding of how the cell regulates the complex expression program of the yeast cell cycle. for example, mofa reassigned genes of the mcm cluster in  <cit>  to several modules. as shown in figure 3a, these modules differ not only in the set of tfs regulating the modules, but also in the different cell cycle phases to which they belong. our results confirm previous findings that mcm <dig> collaborates with yox <dig> to regulate genes in m/g <dig>   <cit>  and collaborates with ndd <dig> and fkh1/fkh <dig> to regulate genes in g2/m   <cit> . in addition, mofa provides regulation information of the y' cluster in  <cit> . the y' cluster contains genes that share dna sequence similarity and are found in y' elements, which are located at chromosome ends. spellman et al.  <cit>  did not figure out how these genes are regulated. as shown in figure 3b, mofa reassigned genes of the y' cluster to three modules and identified several possible regulators , providing information for future experiments.

CONCLUSIONS
we develop a method, called module finding algorithm , for reconstructing trms of the yeast cell cycle by integrating gene expression data and chip-chip data. mofa identified  <dig> trms, which together contain  <dig> distinct genes regulated by  <dig> tfs. from the literature  <cit> ,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes and  <dig> of the  <dig> tfs are known to be involved in the cell cycle. the biological relevance of each inferred trm was validated by using existing experimental data, enrichment for genes in the same mips functional category  <cit> , known dna-binding motifs  <cit> , etc. our analysis shows that different combinations of a fairly small number of tfs are responsible for regulating a large number of genes involved in different cell cycle phases and that there may exist crosstalk between the cell cycle and other cellular processes. besides, mofa is capable of finding many novel tf-target gene relationships that could not be identified by using the current chip-chip data with the stringent p-value cutoff  or the conventional correlation analysis that only checks the co-expressed relationship. in addition, mofa can determine the relationships between tfs that regulating the same module and the regulatory roles of these tfs. we found nine activators and six repressors, consistent with the results of previous studies  <cit> . finally, mofa refines some clusters proposed by previous studies and provides a better understanding of how the complex expression program of the cell cycle is regulated.

we believe that computational analysis of multiple types of data will be a powerful approach to studying complex biological systems when more and more genomic resources such as genome-wide protein activity data and protein-protein interaction data become available.
