BACKGROUND
extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli  strains colonize various sites in the human body and cause diverse extraintestinal infections  <cit> . compared to commensal e. coli strains, extraintestinal strains have larger genomes and encode more virulence factors  <cit> . the group of expec strains includes uropathogenic e. coli strains, septicemia-associated e. coli, meningitis-associated e. coli, and other strains  <cit> . expec strains typically encode i) virulence factors that allow them to bind to human cells   <cit> , ii) factors important for survival in the human body , and iii) factors capable of damaging human cells and tissues   <cit> .

another important feature of pathogenic and also commensal e. coli strains is production of bacteriocins . colicins and microcins  are antibacterial proteins or peptides, respectively, differing in a number of characteristics including molecular mass, presence of post-translational modifications, export from producer cells, etc. colicin js is known to share features of both colicins and microcins  <cit> . bacteriocin production has been shown to play an important ecological role in bacterial competition  <cit> . in addition to antimicrobial activity, several bacteriocin types have also been shown to inhibit proliferation of eukaryotic cells  <cit> . in previous reports, an association of bacteriocin production with e. coli virulence factors was described  as well as a positive correlation between the frequency of bacteriocinogeny and the number of virulence factors encoded by e. coli strains  <cit> . in a former study, production of virulence factors typical for the expec pathotype , in the set of fecal e. coli strains, was associated with a higher frequency of bacteriocinogeny, a higher prevalence of bacteriocin multi-producers, and a greater abundance of microcins h <dig>  m, v, b <dig>  and colicins e <dig>  ia, and s <dig>  <cit> . in addition, production of microcin types h <dig>  m, i <dig>  e <dig>  and v, and colicin e <dig> was associated with the uropathogenic e. coli pathotype . higher production of microcin v was also detected in septicemia-associated expec strains isolated from blood  <cit> .

in this study, we characterized a set of  <dig> human extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli isolated from different body sites and determined the prevalence of  <dig> bacteriocin determinants representing most of the known bacteriocin types. in addition, we determined  <dig> virulence determinants typical of intestinal and extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli strains and also the main phylogroups of e. coli . expec strains were isolated from skin and soft tissue infections, as well as from respiratory, intra-abdominal, and genital infections. results obtained in this study were compared to a previously characterized and published set of  <dig> human fecal e. coli strains  <cit> .

distribution of e. coli phylogenetic groups in expec and fecal strains
among  <dig> tested expec strains, the most prevalent phylogenetic group was b <dig> , followed by phylogroup d , a , and b <dig> . compared to fecal e. coli strains, expec strains had a higher prevalence of phylogenetic group b <dig>  .

bacteriocinogeny and bacteriocin types in expec and fecal strains
the overall frequency of bacteriocinogeny was significantly higher in the set of expec strains , compared to fecal e. coli strains  . while strains producing colicins, but no microcins, were under-represented among expec bacteriocinogenic strains compared to fecal bacteriocinogenic strains , strains producing only microcins  were more prevalent .

the distribution of bacteriocin determinants encoding different bacteriocin types was different between expec and fecal strains. among expec bacteriocinogenic strains, a higher prevalence of the microcin m determinant  and a lower prevalence of determinants encoding microcin b <dig> , colicins ib , and js  was detected, compared to fecal e. coli .

in general, microcin determinants were more prevalent, while colicin determinants were less prevalent among expec strains compared to fecal strains .

detection of individual bacteriocin determinants in phylogroups of expec and fecal strains
in expec strains, there was a  <dig>  % frequency of bacteriocinogeny in the phylogenetic groups a + b <dig> and  <dig>  % in the phylogroups b2 + d. in fecal strains, the frequency of bacteriocinogeny was significantly lower  in the less pathogenic phylogroups a + b <dig> , compared to phylogroups b2 + d . since previous reports showed that several bacteriocin determinants were associated with e. coli phylogroups  <cit> , we tested for the prevalence of bacteriocin determinants within less and more virulent phylogroups . bacteriocin type mc <dig> was found to be more common among expec strains of phylogroup a and b <dig> compared to the same fecal phylogroups. in contrast to microcin c <dig>  the bacteriocin determinant encoding mm was more common in b2 + d phylogroups of expec compared to fecal strains . at the same time, microcin b <dig> was found to be under-represented among expec strains of phylogroups b <dig> and d.table  <dig> detection of individual bacteriocin determinants in expec and fecal bacteriocin producers within less virulent phylogenetic groups a + b <dig> compared to more virulent phylogroups b2 + d

expec strains from sstis, strains from respiratory infections, and strains from genital infections, but not strains from intra-abdominal infections, showed a higher prevalence of phylogroup b <dig>  compared to fecal strains. in addition, the set of strains isolated from sstis also had a lower prevalence of phylogenetic group a  compared to fecal e. coli strains .

within expec strains, the highest rate of bacteriocinogeny was found in e. coli strains isolated from genital smears . compared to fecal strains, strains isolated from sstis and strains from genital infections showed a higher prevalence of the mm determinant. strains from respiratory infections showed a higher prevalence of determinants encoding both mm and mh <dig> . both, expec strains from respiratory infections, and strains from genital infections, showed a higher prevalence of microcin determinants, respectively . at the same time, these strains showed a lower prevalence of colicin determinants.

discussion
expec strains characterized in this study were isolated from various sites of infection including skin and/or soft tissue infections, respiratory, intra-abdominal, and genital infections. compared to fecal strains isolated during the same time period in a similar geographical area, expec strains showed a higher prevalence of seven known virulence factors. these virulence factors comprised adherence factors, aerobactin synthesis and uptake, and cytotoxin synthesis, which is consistent with increased ability to colonize extraintestinal body sites and represents the initial step in the development of extraintestinal infections. these findings are in agreement with previous studies on expec strains .

phylogenetic analysis revealed that phylogenetic group b <dig> was dominant in the set of extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli tested in this study. a high prevalence of phylogenetic group b <dig> is typical of more virulent e. coli strains  <cit>  and a higher prevalence of phylogenetic group b <dig>  has been described in e. coli strains isolated from bacteremia  <cit>  and in uropathogenic strains   <cit> . in a different set of e. coli strains isolated from blood, wound, swab, pus, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, ascitic fluid, and intravascular devices, phylogroups b <dig>  and d  were found to be most prevalent  <cit> . molecular epidemiology, based on mlst , also revealed that the phylogroup b <dig> was correlated with the expec pathotype  <cit> . expec strains characterized in this study were clearly more virulent compared to fecal strains.

compared to fecal strains from phylogroup a and b <dig>  microcin type c <dig> was found to be more common among expec strains of the same phylogroups. these data are consistent with the role of bacteriocin genes regarding increased virulence of e. coli strains. alternatively to bacteriocin genes, genes encoded on the same plasmids could contribute to the increased virulence of these strains since mc <dig> plasmids are relatively large with a number of genes of predicted and unknown functions .

a higher frequency of bacteriocin determinant mm among b2 + d phylogroups suggest that microcin m and/or genes in the same linkage group contribute to the virulence of expec strains. previous reports have shown that the mm and mh <dig> locus is abundant in uropathogenic isolates, while the cluster seldom appeared in intestinal or in other extraintestinal e. coli isolates . our study showed that the percentage of strains coding for mm and mh <dig> differed among expec strains of diverse origin suggesting that the source of extraintestinal e. coli isolates affects the prevalence of mm and mh <dig> determinants. despite the fact that microcins h <dig> and m are typically produced together, sequence analyses have revealed frequent rearrangements at this locus  <cit> . the incomplete linkage of the microcin h <dig> and m locus is also supported by our results.

e. coli strains isolated from intra-abdominal infections were not phylogenetically distinct from fecal flora suggesting that any e. coli strain having access to the abdominal cavity can cause an infection. this was also true for all other tested parameters with just one exception, which related to increased synthesis and uptake of siderophore aerobactin. access to iron thus appears to be of importance to e. coli strains causing infections in intra-abdominal environment

e. coli strains isolated from respiratory infections showed a lower number of colicin producers and a higher number of microcin producers, and also a higher representation of phylogroup b <dig>  unlike other tested expec strains, these strains also showed a higher prevalence of microcin h <dig>  in addition to a higher prevalence of microcin m determinants, suggesting selection for a complete chromosomal region encoding both microcins h <dig> and m  <cit> .

strains isolated from genital infections showed the highest rate of bacteriocinogeny  and also of microcin production, even though they produced only six different colicin types. based on the prevalence of phylogroup b <dig>  e. coli strains isolated from genital smears were the most virulent in our set of expec strains. although, there was no evidence for a direct association between expec strains and bacteriocinogeny, previous studies have found an association between virulence factors and bacteriocin determinants, suggesting a role for bacteriocin in bacterial virulence . it is widely accepted that strains causing genital infections and uropathogenic strains originate from fecal flora, which represents a reservoir of these strains  <cit> . genital infections appear to be caused by only the most virulent and bacteriocinogenic subset of fecal e. coli strains.

e. coli strains isolated from skin and soft tissue infections, i.e., decubiti, abscesses, and surgical wounds, showed a higher prevalence of microcin m and a higher prevalence of phylogenetic group b <dig>  results published by petkovšek et al.  revealed a similarly higher incidence of phylogroup b <dig> in a group of  <dig> sstis strains  <cit> . however, in general, e. coli strains isolated from skin and soft tissue infections showed a bacteriocinogeny frequency comparable to fecal e. coli. bacteriocin synthesis, therefore, in these skin and soft tissue infections does not appear to be of selective advantage. at the same time, skin and soft tissue infections including decubiti, abscesses, and surgical wounds are typical for hospitalized patients and therefore likely hospital-acquired  <cit> . it has been previously reported that uropathogenic esbl-producing hospital-acquired strains showed a low frequency of bacteriocinogeny  <cit> . since hospital-acquired strains are often of clonal origin, we have tested genetic heterogeneity among the sstis strains used in this study. detection of four e. coli phylogroups,  <dig> different virulence, and  <dig> different bacteriocin determinants among the  <dig> strains analyzed in this study revealed  <dig> distinct phenotypes  suggesting that the strains causing sstis are not of clonal origin.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have described a higher frequency of bacteriocinogeny in a set of expec strains isolated from various human extraintestinal infections relative to fecal e. coli. production of bacteriocins is important for most extraintestinal strains isolated from various locations on and in the human body. in general, the extraintestinal environment appears to select for strains with chromosomally encoded microcins , while plasmid-encoded microcin and colicin types  appear to be contra-selected among expec strains suggesting their contribution to fitness in fecal e. coli strains.
