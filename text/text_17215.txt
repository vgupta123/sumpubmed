BACKGROUND
enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli  are a subset of shiga toxin-producing e. coli  strains that cause severe foodborne-disease, including hemorrhagic colitis  and hemolytic uremic syndrome . the classical characteristics of ehec include the expression of shiga toxin, production of attaching-and-effacing  lesions on epithelial cells, and possessing the large virulence plasmid
 <cit> . e. coli o157:h <dig>  is a prototype of ehec and has been considered the most frequent cause of ehec associated outbreaks
 <cit> . however, it has become evident that non-o <dig> ehecs and stecs have emerged and are causing a large number of human infections worldwide. it is estimated that non-o <dig> stecs cause between 50-66% of all stec infections in the united states
 <cit> . for example, the recent large outbreak of e. coli o104:h <dig>  in europe caused  <dig>  cases of stec infection,  <dig> cases of hus, and  <dig> deaths
 <cit> . this stec strain emerged from an enteroaggregative e. coli  strain by acquiring genes encoding shiga toxin
 <cit> . furthermore, a recent study suggested that up to 30% of patients who develop stec-associated hus will suffer long-term complications, including hypertension, neurologic symptoms, and decreased kidney function
 <cit> . as a result, the world health organization  declared virulent non-o <dig> stecs a public health priority
 <cit> . currently, over  <dig> different stec serotypes been described, and over  <dig> of those serotypes have been associated with human diarrheal disease
 <cit> . the serotypes o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig>  also known as the "big six", are associated with human disease most frequently
 <cit> . in fact, the us department of agriculture now requires testing for the presence of these stecs in all non-intact beef products
 <cit> .

there has been extensive research investigating the evolution of e. coli, a species that comprises commensal strains residing naturally in intestinal tracts of their mammalian hosts as well as pathogenic strains causing diverse intestinal and extraintestinal infections in humans and animals. genome sequencing of the first eco <dig> strain edl <dig> and comparative analysis with the e. coli k- <dig> strain mg <dig> revealed a considerable amount of genome plasticity
 <cit> . for example, the genomes of eco <dig> strain edl <dig> and e. coli k- <dig> strain mg <dig> differ in size by  <dig>  mb. edl <dig> contains more than  <dig>  additional genes compared to the mg <dig>  and many of these genes are located in varying size 'islands’ known as o-islands; similarly, strain mg <dig> carries unique genes that are not found in edl <dig> and these genes are located on various sized k-islands
 <cit> . many genetic determinants that encode the virulence of edl <dig> are located in o-islands, including the shiga toxin converting prophage and the locus of enterocyte effacement . furthermore, edl <dig> carries a large virulence plasmid that encodes for an enterohemolysin, a catalase, several proteins related to lipid a modification, and proteases
 <cit> . recently, complete genome sequences of more ehec strains were determined, including two strains of eco <dig> linked to the  <dig> spinach-associated outbreak
 <cit> , and strains of o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig> linked to several sporadic outbreaks in japan
 <cit> , which provided valuable information in understanding the evolution of ehec strains. ehec strains evolved from at least two separate lineages. ehec/epec lineage  <dig> contains o157:h <dig> and its "progenitor" o55:h <dig>  eco <dig> is characterized by its ability to produce shiga toxin, and inability to ferment sorbitol  and express β-glucuronidase activity . the emergence of eco <dig> has been described by a stepwise model, in which eco <dig> evolved in a series of steps from o55:h <dig> by acquiring a stx <dig> gene, conversion to serotype o <dig>  acquiring a stx <dig> gene and changes associated with conversion to sor- and gud- <cit> . the ehec/epec lineage  <dig> contains non-o <dig> serotypes o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig>  evolution of these ehec strains has been proposed through a lineage-independent parallel mechanism, in which strains of various serotypes acquired virulence determinants independently
 <cit> . furthermore, it has been suggested that although different ehec lineages vary in their virulence repertoire and in their global distribution
 <cit> , ehec strains carry a core set of virulence factors
 <cit> .

to the date of our analysis, there are eight ehec strains with complete genome sequences , including five eco <dig> strains, and one strain each of eco <dig>  eco <dig>  eco <dig>  respectively
 <cit> . the genomes of ehec strains have been shown to be rich in prophages, integrated elements, and insertion sequences. this intrinsic feature corresponds to the presence of numerous identical sequences in the genome, some relatively long , which, with previous sequencing capabilities, posed traditionally a big challenge in genome assembly and gap closure. in this study, we determined the complete genome sequences of two highly virulent e. coli o <dig>  strains linked to two separate outbreaks of ehec infection in the us
 <cit>  and europe
 <cit>  by compiling sequences generated by roche  <dig>  illumina, and pacific biosciences  sequencing platforms. we were able to finish two high quality  and fully closed eco <dig> genomes quickly, using a strategy benefitting from long sequence reads  and similar to a study reported previously
 <cit> . we then performed comparative genomic analyses between the eco <dig> strains and to other fully sequenced ehecs, stecs and other e. coli/shigella strains available in public databases to gain insight into the genome and virulence evolution of ehec.

RESULTS
genomic signature of eco <dig> strain rm <dig>  a us lettuce-associated outbreak strain
the genome of rm <dig> is composed of a  <dig> , <dig> bp chromosome and two large plasmids, po145- <dig>  and prm <dig>  . the chromosome consists of  <dig>  coding dna sequences ,  <dig> rrna, and  <dig> trnas. among the annotated cdss,  <dig> % have been assigned to at least one cog functional category. the backbone of the rm <dig> chromosome is interrupted by numerous mobile elements, including prophage/prophage-like elements , integrated elements  or insertion sequences  . the prophage that carries the genes  encoding shiga toxin in strain rm <dig> is about 50 kb in size, and located adjacent to the argw locus. the lee island is integrated at the selc locus in strain rm <dig>  analogous to eco <dig>  but differs from the other non-o <dig> ehec strains . notably, the lee island is absent in the o104:h <dig> german outbreak strain that has been shown by whole genome analysis to have evolved from an eaec

plasmid po145- <dig> appears to be related to the plasmid po <dig>  as it carries several virulence genes that are also present on po <dig>  including the hlybcda operon, encoding the enterohemolysin and its secretion apparatus; espp gene, encoding a serine protease; toxb gene, encoding a homolog of large clostridial toxin toxb; and genes encoding an adenine-specific methyltransferase as well as the enzymes related to lipid a biosynthesis/modification  2--lipid iva acyltransferase). however, po145- <dig> is also notably different from po <dig>  evidenced by the fact that this plasmid lacks katp, flmabc, as well as the operon encoding a general secretion system present on po <dig> , but carries a vagcd toxin-antitoxin gene cassette and a yebf-like gene encoding a colicin immunity protein.

the second large plasmid in strain rm <dig>  contains  <dig> cdss. unlike po145- <dig>  this plasmid carries fewer is elements , but with a higher gc content . the most striking feature of prm <dig> is the cluster of genes conferring multidrug resistance, including tetracycline , chloramphenicol/florfenicol , streptomycin , and sulfonamides . additionally, the gene encoding dihydropteroate synthase  is adjacent to strab, conferring cells resistance to dapsone. the plasmid prm <dig> also carries several genes encoding proteins involved in dna replication and transfer, such as trag, trah, and traf, however, the mobility of this plasmid remains to be determined.

comparative genomic analysis of eco145
compared with the genome of rm <dig>  the genome of strain rm <dig> , is about 180-kb smaller. it is composed of a  <dig> ,276 bp chromosome and two plasmids, po145- <dig>  and prm <dig> , encoding  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> cdss, respectively . similarly to rm <dig>   <dig> % of cdss have been assigned to at least one cog category. the backbones of the two eco <dig> chromosomes exhibit overall genomic synteny, with the exception of three major inversions . the first inversion in rm <dig> spans chromosome positions  <dig>  to  <dig>  , and appears to be unique to strain rm <dig> since this region in strain rm <dig> is syntenic with other ehec strains including eco157; similarly, the second inversion, from  <dig> ,020- <dig> , <dig>  appears to also be inverted in strain rm <dig>  in contrast, the third inversion  appears to be unique to strain rm <dig>  as this region in strain rm <dig> is syntenic with other ehec strains .

the rm <dig> virulence plasmid  shares limited genetic features with po145- <dig>  namely the ehec-enterohemolysin gene cluster , the 4-gene cluster related to lipid a biosynthesis and modification, and the psiba operon encoding plasmid sos inhibition protein b and a . plasmid po145- <dig> carries a considerable number of genes that are absent from po145- <dig>  such as the 11-gene cluster  related to the type ii secretion system; the 7-gene cluster related to incf plasmid conjugal transfer apparatus ; genes encoding relb/rele toxin/antitoxin system; genes encoding chromosome/plasmid partitioning protein para/parb; and genes encoding the lesion bypass dna polymerase v , lipoprotein taga , and colanic acid biosynthesis acetyltransferase wcab .

unlike prm <dig>  prm <dig> does not carry any known drug resistance genes; rather, it is characterized by the two large gene clusters, encoding type ivb pilus  and type iv secretion system that is highly similar to the gene cluster encoding t-dna transfer apparatus . interestingly, the organizations of the two gene clusters were shuffled and re-arranged considerably in prm <dig>  resulting in the insertion of genes virb1- <dig>  virb7- <dig>  and vird <dig> between pilm and piln genes .

comparative analysis of the coding regions of the two eco <dig> genomes revealed that they share  <dig>  common genes, with  <dig> and  <dig> genes unique to strain rm <dig> and rm <dig>  respectively. although a large portion of strain-specific genes for either rm <dig> or rm <dig> are hypothetical or mobile element-related genes, strain rm <dig> contains  <dig> unique genes with annotated functions, and many are related to metabolism or dna replication and modification. notably, there are eight methyltransferase encoding genes present only in rm <dig>  and, additionally, five are present in prophages . in contrast, among the  <dig> rm13516-specific genes, there were no methyltransferases; rather, many of the rm13516-specific genes encode functions in fatty acid biosynthesis, cell stress resistance, and dna/protein secretions .

eco <dig> methylomes
the marked difference in the number of genes encoding methyl transferases between the two eco <dig> strains led us to compare the global methylation profiles  between the two strains. we took advantage of pacific biosciences’  single molecule
 <cit> , real-time  sequencing technology’s capability to determine base modifications during sequencing to identify putative methylation sites across both genomes, and identified that both genomes had adenine methylated exclusively. a high percentage of the 5′-gatc-3′ motif sites were detected to be adenine methylated in both genomes , suggesting a functional role of dna adenine methylase  in both strains. in contrast, a distinct difference in adenine modification was observed for 5′-ctgcag-3′ and 5′-dtgcag-3′ motif sites between the two strains. in strain rm <dig>   <dig> % of the adenines were detected as methylated in the motif 5′-ctgcag-3′ , whereas in rm <dig>  none of the adenines in the  <dig>  motifs were detected as methylated . similarly, in strain rm <dig>  about  <dig> % of the sites of motif 5′-dtgcag-3′ were detected to be methylated, whereas in strain rm <dig> less than  <dig> % of the sites were detected as methylated . methylation of adenine in 5′-ctgcag-3′ in strain rm <dig> is predicted to occur by the methylase of the type ii restriction-modification  bsubi/psti system. genes encoding the bsubi/psti r-m  system are located in the stx2a prophage. these two genes encode proteins that are extremely similar to enzymes shown biochemically to recognize ctgcag  previously
 <cit> . the alignment of the protein encoded by ecrm13514_ <dig> with the dna methylase m.ecogiii is shown in additional file
1: figure s2c. the methylase m. ecogiii, cloned from eco <dig> strain c227- <dig>  was shown to specifically methylate the adenine in the dna motif ctgcag
 <cit> . the only difference is the foreshortening of this new gene, a phenomenon that has been observed in other methylases. the r gene of rm <dig> is 100% identical to that of the strain c227- <dig>  which was shown to be biochemically active
 <cit> . interestingly, this bsubi/psti r-m system is absent in strain rm <dig>  but conserved in the stx2a prophage of the eco <dig> strain 2011c- <dig> and eco <dig> strain  <dig>

the motif 5′-dtgcag-3′ is asymmetric, while 5′ctgcag-3′ is a symmetric motif, and it is possible that methylation of adenine in the motif 5′-dtgcag-3′ is due to non-specific activity of the bsubi/psti methylase, or catalyzed by an un-characterized, possibly type iig methylase .

phylogeny of eco145
the maximum-likelihood tree constructed using the concatenated nucleotide sequences of  <dig> orthologous cdss  from  <dig> e. coli and shigella strains suggests that eco <dig> shares a common evolutionary lineage with o157:h <dig>  o55:h <dig>  and s. dysenteriae, whereas other non-o <dig> ehec strains such as  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , along with the german outbreak stec strain 2011c- <dig> , share a common evolutionary lineage with non-pathogenic e. coli strains, including strain w and se <dig> . as expected, the two eco <dig> strains were grouped together. a similar phylogeny was observed for eco <dig>  eco <dig>  and other non-o <dig> ehecs when all the orthologous snps located in the coding regions of  <dig> genomes were used for tree construction . in both trees s. dysenteriae was clustered together with eco <dig>  eco <dig> and eco55:h <dig>  supporting the theory that escherichia coli and shigella spp. belong to the same species
 <cit> . slight differences in placement of a few strains were observed between the two trees, including e. coli strains se <dig>  w, nrg 857c, and cft <dig>  and s. dysenteriae strain sd <dig>  s. dysenteriae shares a common ancestor with eco <dig> in the phylogenetic tree constructed using  <dig> cdss, whereas in the genome-wide snp-based tree, it is more closely related to eco <dig> than eco <dig> . e. coli strains se <dig> and w are clustered together in the snps-based tree, but not in the cdss-based tree. a similar shift was observed for strains nrg 857c and cft <dig> . eco <dig> appears to diverge from eco <dig> prior to the separation of o157:h <dig> from the o55:h <dig> enteropathogenic escherichia coli  strain . consistently, both eco <dig> strains express β-glucuronidase activity, a trait that was conserved in eco <dig> but lost in eco <dig> due to mutations. therefore, similar to other non-o <dig> ehec strains including o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig>  acquisition of the shiga toxin encoding gene in eco <dig> is lineage-independent.
 <cit> . four of  <dig> genes were removed because a subgroup of strains does not have these genes. b, maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree, constructed using genome-wide orthologous snps from  <dig> complete genomes. pairwise comparisons of all genome sequences were carried out using nucmer from the mumer package
 <cit>  and highly similar regions  were removed from the analysis. orthologous snps are defined as snps present within the remaining alignments among all genomes. only those snps present within the coding  regions were used for further phylogenetic analysis. the best substitution model  for the analysis was selected using modeltest
 <cit> , and the tree was constructed using raxml
 <cit>  with <dig>  bootstrap replicates. the ehec strains  and the stec strain  are in bold. scale bar: number of substitutions per base. only bootstrap value <=  <dig> are displayed.

comparative analysis of ehec genomes
a pangenome analysis of the chromosomes of  <dig> ehec strains identified a core of  <dig> genes . a large portion of ehec core genes are conserved in eco <dig>  and in the porcine umnk <dig> strain . as expected, eco <dig> shares more genes with eco <dig> than with any other non-o <dig> ehec strain. there are  <dig> genes only found in strains of eco <dig> and eco145; most are located in o-islands, and are associated with functions related to fatty acid synthesis, c5-branched dibasic acid metabolism, iron utilization, and type iii secretion regulation . there are  <dig> genes specific to both eco <dig> and the other non-o <dig> ehec strains , including genes related to phenylacetic acid degradation and glyoxylate, dicarboxylate, and fatty acid metabolism . blastp search of all eco <dig> cdss against other ehec genomes revealed  <dig> genes that are specific to serotype o145:h <dig>  although a large portion of these genes encode hypothetical proteins, the search also revealed genes related to lps biosynthesis, type i restriction system, adhesion/invasins, and crispr-associated proteins .
 <cit> . ehec core genome genes and serotype unique genes compared to o <dig> strains are in dataset s <dig>  and list of o-islands present in non-o <dig> genomes are in additional file
5: dataset s <dig> 

genomic islands and integrative sequences
because of the close evolutionary relationship of eco <dig> and eco <dig>  we examined the conservation of the  <dig> eco <dig> o-islands in genomes of non-o <dig> ehecs and the stec o <dig> . the extent of the conservation in either of the eco <dig> strains is greater than any of the non-o <dig> ehec strains  or the o104:h <dig> strain . part or all of  <dig>  and  <dig>  eco <dig> o-islands were detected in strains rm <dig> and rm <dig>  respectively. the large genomic islands that appear to separate the ehec/epec linage i from the ehec/epec lineage ii include oi- <dig>  oi- <dig>  and oi- <dig>  both oi- <dig> and oi- <dig> are fully conserved in both eco <dig> strains; whereas the oi- <dig> is partially retained in strain rm <dig> , but fully conserved in strain rm <dig> . the large islands oi- <dig>  oi- <dig>  oi- <dig>  oi- <dig>  and oi- <dig> are conserved in all  <dig> ehec strains. oi- <dig> and oi- <dig> are highly similar, and both known as tellurite resistance islands . besides the tellurite resistance genes, both islands carry the genes encoding proteins necessary to synthesize urease, an enzyme that has been suggested to play a role in cell acid resistance in the host gi tract
 <cit> . similar to edl <dig>  rm <dig> carries two tellurite resistance islands. in contrast, rm <dig> carries only one tellurite resistance island , similar to the other non-o <dig> ehec and stec strain o <dig> .

the pathogenicity island lee is a molecular characteristic of ehec strains responsible for the formation of a/e lesions on epithelial cells. the lee island  for both eco <dig> strains are integrated at trna , analogous to eco <dig> strains, and are also similar in size  to eco <dig> . the lee islands in other non-o <dig> ehec strains are generally larger in size  and integrated at either the pheu or phev locus . further analysis of all lee genes reveals a core of  <dig> genes that are conserved in all  <dig> ehec genomes . the eco <dig> lee islands are highly similar to that of eco <dig> ; whereas the other non-o <dig> strains have more complex lee accessory regions. phylogenetic analysis of the lee reveals a similar phylogeny to that derived from whole genome-based comparisons . both oi- <dig> and oi- <dig> are related to t3ss and are partially conserved in eco <dig>  the oi- <dig> diverged largely in other non-o <dig> ehec strains ; whereas the oi- <dig> in o <dig> is more similar to o <dig> than o <dig> including the integrated site  .

prophages and iss
rm <dig> and rm <dig> have  <dig> and  <dig> prophage/prophage-like elements, respectively, similar to the range found in other stec strains . in both o <dig> strains, lambda or lambda-like phages are predominant . except for eco <dig>  all eight ehec strains and the stec o <dig> strain contain a stx2a prophage . phylogenetic analysis of the stx2a prophages suggests that, unlike the eco <dig> strains, the stx2a prophages of the two eco <dig> are distantly related . the podoviridae family stx2a prophage in rm <dig> is highly similar to those of the eco <dig> strain  <dig> and eco <dig> strain 2011c- <dig>  whereas the lambda-like stx2a prophage in rm <dig> is closely related to that in eco <dig>  further examination of the integration sites in eco <dig> reveals a total of  <dig> putative sites; five are unique to eco <dig>  and  <dig> and  <dig> are shared with eco <dig> and the other non-o <dig> stec strains, respectively . those integration sites appear to be unevenly distributed across the chromosomes in any of the stec genomes .

we detected  <dig> and  <dig> iss in strains rm <dig> and rm <dig>  respectively . the number of is in rm <dig> is similar to that in eco <dig>  whereas the number of is in rm <dig> is similar to that in other non-o <dig> stec genomes. in both eco <dig> strains, is <dig> appeared to be the most prevalent is, followed by the is <dig> and the isec <dig> . in fact, is <dig> appeared also to be the predominant is element in all  <dig> ehec strains, supporting its critical role in the evolution in ehec
 <cit> .

plasmids
ehec strains differ significantly in the total number and composition of plasmids . the ehec virulence plasmids display large variations in gene content and gene organization, indicating a distinct evolutionary history for each plasmid. conservation of genes related to enterohemolysin and lipid a modification suggests they are part of the ehec core virulence factors . alignment of plasmid sequences reveals that the five po157s form three closely related groups, whereas other plasmids including both po145- <dig> and po145- <dig> diverge significantly. further analysis of po145- <dig> reveals several segments related to the large plasmids of eco <dig>  including the 29-kb segment  containing genes toxb, trag, trab, and repa with a  <dig> % identity to po26-vir  and the 27-kb dna segment  containing genes espp, nikb, and psiab, that was aligned perfectly with the plasmid po26-crl . the presence of is elements or transposons at the borders of each dna segment suggests a "mix and match" evolution path of the po145- <dig> 

the multidrug resistance genes in the plasmid prm <dig> are located on a 21-kb dna segment  that is also present on plasmids of e. coli , salmonella , and providencia stuartii  . interestingly, this large dna segment is also present on a genomic island in s. typhimurium . similarly, the 22-kb dna fragment  of prm <dig> carrying genes repa, clpp, dsba, etc. is also found in plasmids ptc <dig>  pp <dig>  pndm-kn isolated from providencia stuartii, photobacterium damselae, and klebsiella pneumonia . prm <dig> does not appear to be related to any previously reported ehec or stec plasmids, rather, there is a large dna segment containing type ivb pilus genes and virb1-virb <dig> that are also present on escherichia coli plasmids pchi7122- <dig> and pr <dig> and salmonella plasmid psh146- <dig> .

discussion
the rapid development of next generation sequencing technologies enables us to obtain the bacterial draft genomes quickly, however, it remains challenging to fully close a genome. this is particularly true for genomes of stec due to the prevalence of mobile elements. we used second-generation sequence technology  to produce draft genomes of the eco <dig> strains corresponding to  <dig> to  <dig> contigs that are difficult to close because of the common repetitive sequences. we then made use of error-corrected long reads  provided by pacbio sequence technology, which facilitated genome closure by spanning identical sequence with unique flanking regions for placement. the alignment of high coverage short reads along with an adequate number of informative long reads provides an extremely effective strategy for efficient closing and finishing of genomes containing multiple long identical sequences, regardless of size. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the complete genome sequence of eco <dig>  one of the "big six" non-o <dig> ehec serotypes. the genomic information obtained in this study reveals the genomic diversity in ehec, and contributes significantly to our understanding of genome and virulence evolution of ehec strains.

whole genome-based phylogenetic analysis reveals that eco <dig> evolved from a common ancestor with eco <dig>  likely from an epec strain. it appears that the eco <dig> diverged as a sub-lineage prior to the separation of eco <dig> from the "progenitor" eco <dig> epec strain, followed by acquisition of a shiga-toxin converting prophage. this speculation is further supported by the observation that both eco <dig> strains display gud activity. comparative genomics analyses of eco <dig> with eco <dig> and other ehec strains reveals that eco <dig> and eco <dig> share nearly the same, or more, core genes than the number of core genes eco <dig> share with other non-o <dig> ehec strains. furthermore, eco <dig> and eco <dig> share a larger core set of genes than the core of eco <dig> and any other non-o <dig> ehec strains. examining the eco157-specific genomic islands  in eco <dig> and the other non-o <dig> ehec genomes also supports the common lineage of eco <dig> with eco <dig>  eco <dig> strains contain at least 30% more eco <dig> o-islands than do any of the other non-o <dig> ehec strains, including the large o-islands. among four additional o-islands that were categorized as unique to eco <dig> and the "progenitor" eco <dig> epec genomes
 <cit> , three of these  are conserved in eco <dig> genomes, but none of them were identified in other non-o <dig> ehec genomes. both lee islands in eco <dig> and eco <dig> were integrated at the selc locus, whereas the lee islands in the other non-o <dig> ehec strains were integrated at the phev or pheu locus
 <cit> . although all lee islands share a core set of genes
 <cit> , eco <dig> and eco <dig> strains have a similar lee accessory region , compared with other non-o <dig> strains. the o-island  <dig> is a nine-gene cluster related to iron acquisition, and in eco <dig>  it is inserted into the acid fitness island, analogous to eco <dig>  eco <dig> and s. dysenteriae <cit> . in contrast, none of the other non-o <dig> ehec strains carry this island. these common genetic determinants as well as the gene organization patterns between eco <dig> and eco <dig> support their common evolutionary history, which serves possibly as the molecular basis for the common phenotypes shared by these two major ehec serotypes. in fact, a recent study by cdc of the epidemiological features of stec infection in the us found eco <dig>  and eco <dig>  have higher hospitalization rates than eco <dig> , eco <dig> , or eco <dig> 
 <cit> .

it has previously been shown that some non-o <dig> ehec strains  arose from a different lineage  compared to eco <dig> strains  via parallel evolution
 <cit> . comparative analysis of eco <dig> with the other non-o <dig> ehec strains reveals a total of  <dig> genes that are unique to eco <dig> and non-o <dig> ehec strains, including  <dig> genes related to degradation of phenylacetate, a common aromatic compound in the intestinal tracts of animals and humans, and  <dig> genes related to glyoxylate, dicarboxylate, and fatty acid metabolism. in eco <dig> strains, we found the phenylacetate degradation gene cluster has been replaced by oi- <dig> , whereas the 19-gene cluster related to glyoxylate, dicarboxylate, and fatty acid metabolism has been replaced by the oi- <dig>  encoding accessory proteins of t3ss. acquisition of oi- <dig> appears to be lineage-independent since in both eco <dig> and the other non-o <dig> ehec strains, oi- <dig> is integrated at the pheu locus, whereas in eco <dig>  the oi- <dig> is at the phev locus. additionally, both eco <dig> and other non-o <dig> ehec strains carry an eight gene cluster related to aspartate metabolism, which is absent in eco157; similarly, both eco <dig> and the other non-o <dig> ehec strains carry the frl operon, which is absent in eco <dig>  further examination of these gene clusters in eco <dig> reveals that, similar to eco <dig>  it contains the 19-gene cluster related to fatty acid metabolism; similarly to eco <dig>  eco <dig> lacks both the phenylacetate degradation genes and the aspartate metabolism genes. therefore, it appears that the elimination of genes related to glyoxylate, dicarboxylate, and fatty acid metabolism in eco <dig> occurred after separation of eco <dig> and eco <dig> lineages, whereas elimination of phenylacetate degradation genes and the aspartate metabolism genes occurred before the divergence of eco <dig> from eco <dig>  loss of the frl operon appears to be specific to eco <dig>  suggesting a role of gene loss in evolution of ehec strains.

mobile elements are known to play a key role in driving genome and virulence evolution of ehec. a total of  <dig> different types of prophage were identified in  <dig> ehec genomes, of which lambda-like phages are the most prevalent. among the  <dig> ehec strains examined, nine carry stx2a prophages; eco <dig> carries a stx <dig> prophage. both prophages and integrative elements are important sources of genes encoding t3ss effectors and other virulence-related proteins. overall there are about 43- <dig> genes encoding t3ss effectors in the  <dig> ehec strains, and the variation is largely due to the gene encoding effector nleg, which ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> copies in the genome . additionally, the eco <dig> strains do not carry the prophage encoding the espw effector, which is present in o <dig> and the other non-o <dig> strains, whereas all non-o <dig> ehec strains are missing the prophage-encoded nled effector. however, only the eco <dig> strains have functional copies of the prophage encoding espv effector. it remains unclear how such variation impacts the virulence of ehec strains.

the two eco <dig> strains evolved to ehec strains independently through gene acquisitions/gene loss, natural mutations, and genomic rearrangements. the chromosome of us lettuce-associated outbreak strain rm <dig> is about 183 kb larger than that of the belgium ice-cream associated outbreak strain rm <dig>  which relates mainly to the difference in prophage/prophage-like elements. strain rm <dig> carries eight prophage/prophage-like elements not present in rm <dig>  corresponding to more strain-specific genes in rm <dig> than in rm <dig>  the stx2a-prophage in the us outbreak strain  belongs to the podoviridae family, whereas the stx2a-prophage in the belgium outbreak strain  is a lambda-like phage. although genes on the lee island , as well as those on the t3ss-related islands , are highly conserved between the two strains, nonsense mutations have been observed in several putative virulence genes in rm <dig>  implying loss of functions in the us outbreak strain. the po145-rm <dig> lacks the gene cluster encoding the type ii secretion systems, whereas the po145-rm <dig> lacks the gene encoding the large clostridial toxin toxb. strain rm <dig> evolved to be resistant to several common antibiotics including sulfonamides, streptomycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol due to the acquisition of plasmid prm <dig>  in contrast, the belgium outbreak strain is susceptible to all the above antibiotics. rather, it carries a second plasmid  encoding a type iv secretion system as well as a dna conjugal transfer apparatus , suggesting a proficiency in dna transfer and producing extracellular products. this independent acquisition of genes mediated by various mobile elements has also been reported in eco <dig> and eco <dig>  leading to a variety of genomically related strains with distinct bacteriophage collections
 <cit> .

we observed distinct methylation profiles between the two eco <dig> strains. although both strains exhibited dam methylation , only rm <dig> exhibited adenine methylation at 5′-ctgcag-3′ and 5′-dtgcag-3′ motif sites. the 5′-ctgcag-3′ motif would likely be recognized by the bsubi/psti type ii restriction-modification  system  located in the stx2a prophage. dna methylation in bacteria has been shown to play a role in replication, gene expression and virulence
 <cit> , as well as modulating phase variation of agn <dig> in e. coli <cit> , phase variation of pap pilus in e. coli <cit> , and control of o-antigen chain length in salmonella enterica <cit> . however, the implication of such methylation differences in these two o <dig> strains with respect to bacterial virulence and fitness remains to be determined.

CONCLUSIONS
our study is the first report on two complete eco <dig> genomes. the genomic information obtained in this study promotes not only the identification of eco145-specific genes, but also the recognition of ehec core genes, which would facilitate the detection of stec in food. our whole-genome based phylogeny analysis demonstrated that o <dig> and o157:h <dig> strains ascended from the same ehec1/epec <dig> lineage along with o55:h <dig> epec strains. while these strains shared a common epec ancestor, o <dig> strains formed a sublineage prior to acquiring the shiga toxin-converting prophage. once in the sublineage, similar to other non-o <dig> ehec strains, o <dig> strains independently attained numerous virulence factors including stx2a prophage and the ehec plasmid. additionally, our study also shows these mobile genetic elements not only contribute to gene content of ehec strains, but also impact the epigenetics of the individual ehec strain.
