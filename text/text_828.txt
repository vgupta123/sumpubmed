BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae is recognized as a major bacterial agent that causes community-acquired pneumonia and other invasive diseases, such as bacteremia and meningitis  <cit> . upon infection with s. pneumoniae, the innate mechanism of the early phase of immunity plays an important role in host defense, which is largely mediated by neutrophil-dependent immune responses. the infiltration of many neutrophils into the alveolar spaces eradicates the infection via an immunoglobulin g -mediated opsonophagocytic killing  mechanism and the production of reactive oxygen species   <cit> . igg <dig> that is specific for pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide, a thymus-independent type  <dig>  antigen, is highly protective against infection with s. pneumoniae  <cit> . recently, we reported similar findings that pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine  immunization increases serotype 3-specific igg <dig> serum levels, which facilitates survival after pneumococcal infection  <cit> . cxc chemokines, including macrophage inflammatory protein - <dig> and keratinocyte-derived chemokine , a homologue of human interleukin - <dig>  were involved in neutrophil accumulation at the inflammatory sites. previous studies showed that death in mice challenged with s. pneumoniae was preceded by bacterial growth within 2 days after infection and was associated with a delayed increase in pulmonary mip- <dig> levels and neutrophil recruitment  <cit> .

dc-associated c-type lectin- <dig> , a c-type lectin receptor, possesses a carbohydrate recognition domain for the ca2+-dependent recognition of mannose oligosaccharides  <cit> . dectin- <dig> invokes innate immune responses and subsequent adaptive immunity in fungal infection. dectin-2-mediated recognition of candida albicans leads to nf-κb activation, which induces il-1β, il- <dig> and il- <dig> production by macrophages  <cit> . il-1β and il- <dig> potentiate neutrophil recruitment into the infected tissues through inducing il-17a production . t helper - <dig> cell-related cytokines, il- <dig> and interferon gamma , play a critical role in the neutrophil-mediated host defense against s. pneumoniae infection, which is correlated with mip- <dig> and tnf-α production  <cit> . mice with targeted disruption of the il- <dig> or ifn-γ gene are highly susceptible to pneumococcal pneumonia  <cit> .

in the present study, we aimed to determine the role of dectin- <dig> in the neutrophil-mediated host defense to s. pneumoniae infection using mice with a genetic disruption of dectin- <dig>  we found that dectin- <dig> knock out  mice were more susceptible to this infection than wild type  mice, and our results suggest that dectin-2-dependent il- <dig> production may contribute to ifn-γ synthesis and subsequent production of serotype-specific anti-capsular polysaccharide igg after s. pneumoniae infection, which may promote opsonization of this bacterium for engulfment.

RESULTS
role of dectin- <dig> in the host defense to pneumococcal infection
to clarify whether dectin- <dig> deficiency affects early-phase host protection against pneumococcal infection, we initially examined the susceptibility of dectin-2ko mice to s. pneumoniae infection and compared it with wt mice by recording the survival rate of the infected mice and also the bacterial load in their lungs. dectin-2ko mice had a lower survival rate , whereas 67 % of wt mice survived throughout the observation period . the difference in the survival rate was statistically significant. in addition, the number of live bacterial colonies was significantly lower in the lungs of wt mice than in dectin-2ko mice on day  <dig> post-infection . these data indicate that dectin- <dig> plays a critical role in early-phase host defense against pneumococcal infection.fig.  <dig> effect of dectin- <dig> deficiency on s. pneumoniae infection. wt mice and dectin-2ko mice were infected with s. pneumoniae. a the number of live mice was recorded daily. closed circles, wt mice ; open squares, dectin-2ko mice . b bacterial load in the lungs was examined on day  <dig> post-infection. each symbol shows each mouse, and the bars indicate the mean ± sd. similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. *p <  <dig> 




role of dectin- <dig> in the neutrophil-mediated host defense to pneumococcal infection
neutrophils rapidly accumulate at the most infected sites and they play a central role in eradicating bacteria after pulmonary s. pneumoniae infection  <cit> . therefore, to address the role of dectin- <dig> in neutrophil-mediated host defense against this bacterial pathogen, we first evaluated neutrophil recruitment in the infected lungs. a histological analysis showed no apparent difference in inflammatory cell infiltration in the lungs between wt and dectin-2ko mice 12 h after infection with s. pneumoniae. when observed at a higher magnification, neutrophil accumulation in the alveolar spaces was shown to be comparable between these mice . in addition, the number of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid  was almost equivalent between wt and dectin-2ko mice 12 h and 24 h after infection .fig.  <dig> equivalent level of neutrophil infiltration in lungs between wt and dectin-2ko mice. wt mice and dectin-2ko mice were infected with s. pneumoniae.

to further clarify the role of dectin- <dig> in the neutrophil-mediated host defense, we evaluated the phagocytosis rate and phagocytosis index of these cells in balf 12 h and 24 h after infection. as shown in fig. 3a, the rate of neutrophils engulfing pneumococcus was significantly lower in dectin-2ko mice than in wt mice at both time points, although the average number of pneumococcus per engulfed neutrophil did not differ largely between these mice .fig.  <dig> effect of dectin- <dig> deficiency on the engulfment of pneumococcus by neutrophils. wt mice and dectin-2ko mice were infected with s. pneumoniae. the phagocytic rate  and phagocytic index  of neutrophils in balf were calculated 12 h and 24 h after infection. the number of neutrophils was estimated by multiplying the total cell count by its proportion identified in morphological analysis. each group consists of five to seven mice. similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. *, p <  <dig> ; ns, not significantly different



role of dectin- <dig> in the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines after pneumococcal infection
to clarify the role of dectin- <dig> in the host response to s. pneumoniae infection, we compared the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as il-1β, tnf-α, il- <dig>  ifn-γ, il-17a, and mip- <dig>  in balf between wt and dectin-2ko mice 12 h after infection. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the production of ifn-γ was significantly attenuated in dectin-2ko mice compared with wt mice, although there was no significant difference in the production of other cytokines and chemokines.fig.  <dig> effect of dectin- <dig> deficiency on cytokine production in the lungs after pneumococcal infection. wt mice and dectin-2ko mice were infected with s. pneumoniae. cytokine concentrations in balf were measured 12 h post-infection. each group consists of five to seven mice. similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. *, p <  <dig> ; ns, not significantly different



to define the cellular source of ifn-γ production, we used flow cytometry to examine the intracellular expression of this cytokine in various cells in the lungs of wt mice 12 h after infection. ifn-γ was expressed only in exudate macrophages, but not in alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer  cells, nkt cells, γδt cells, cd4+ t cells or cd8+ t cells .fig.  <dig> cellular source of ifn-γ production in the lungs after pneumococcal infection. wt mice were infected with s. pneumoniae. the lung leukocytes prepared at 12 h post-infection were stained with various mabs to identify populations of myeloid cells and lymphocytes, and intracellular ifn-γ expression was analyzed in each population using flow cytometry. cut-off lines were determined on the histograms stained with isotype-matched igg. ex mφ, exudate macrophages; alv mφ, alveolar macrophages; neu, neutrophils; igg, isotype-matched igg

role of dectin- <dig> in the activation of dendritic cells upon stimulation with s. pneumoniae
to address the role of dectin- <dig> in the cellular response to s. pneumoniae, we examined how the lack of dectin- <dig> affected the production of il-12p <dig> by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells  upon stimulation with viable s. pneumoniae, lysates or culture supernatant from this bacterium. as shown in fig. 7a, il-12p <dig> production by bm-dcs was almost comparable between wt and dectin- <dig> ko mice, when stimulated with viable pneumococcus, whereas il-12p <dig> was not produced by bm-dcs stimulated with heat-killed bacteria . by contrast, il-12p <dig> synthesis by bm-dcs was significantly reduced in dectin-2ko mice compared with wt mice, when stimulated with s. pneumoniae lysates at lower doses . similar results were obtained when bm-dcs were stimulated with s. pneumoniae culture supernatant .fig.  <dig> effect of dectin- <dig> deficiency on il-12p <dig> production by bd-dcs upon stimulation with s. pneumoniae. bm-dcs from wt mice  or dectin-2ko mice  were cultured with live s. pneumoniae ; lysates from s. pneumoniae or sham-operated pbs  ; s. pneumoniae culture supernatant or todd-hewitt broth  ; or lps , cpg  or mannan  for 24 h. il-12p <dig> concentrations in the culture supernatants were measured using elisa. each column shows the mean ± sd of triplicate culture. similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. moi, multiplicity of infection. *, p <  <dig> ; ns, not significantly different



to determine which s. pneumoniae molecule is recognized by dectin- <dig>  we examined how depletion of the concanavalin a -bound fraction in culture supernatants affects il-12p <dig> synthesis by bm-dcs. il-12p <dig> synthesis by bm-dcs from wt mice was abolished when stimulated with the culture supernatant that was depleted of the cona-bound fraction . in further experiments, we examined whether the cona-bound fraction in culture supernatant stimulated bm-dcs and whether this activity was dependent on dectin- <dig>  as shown in fig. 8b, the cona-bound fraction induced il-12p <dig> production by bm-dcs from wt mice and this activity was completely abrogated in bm-dcs from dectin-2ko mice, similar to the response caused by mannan.fig.  <dig> dectin-2-dependent il-12p <dig> production by bm-dcs in the cona-bound fraction of s. pneumoniae culture supernatant. a bm-dcs derived from wt mice were stimulated with the cona-sepharose4b-treated or sham-treated supernatant from s. pneumoniae or mannan for 24 h. b bm-dcs from wt mice  or dectin-2ko mice  were cultured with the cona-sepharose4b-bound fraction of s. pneumoniae culture supernatants, lps  or mannan  for 24 h. the il-12p <dig> concentration in the culture supernatants was measured by elisa. each column shows the mean ± sd of triplicate culture. similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. sup-sham, sham-treated supernatants; sup-tx, cona-sepharose4b-treated supernatants; mannan-sham, sham-treated mannan; mannan-tx, cona-sepharose4b-treated mannan; cona-bound fr, cpna-sepharose4b-bound fraction. * p <  <dig> 




discussion
in the present study, we evaluated the role of dectin- <dig> in the neutrophil-mediated host defense to pneumococcal infection. our data indicate that a defect in dectin- <dig> rendered mice highly susceptible to a serotype  <dig> strain of s. pneumoniae, as shown by elevated mortality and an increased bacterial burden in the lungs. it is well documented that neutrophil-predominant inflammatory responses play a pivotal role in eradicating this bacterium  <cit> . therefore, we predicted that a defect of dectin- <dig> expression impaired the recruitment of neutrophils and clearance of s. pneumoniae in the lungs after infection. dessing and co-workers previously demonstrated that tlr2- and tlr4-mediated recognition of pneumococcal components induced the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as il- <dig> and il-1β, and chemokines, such as mip- <dig> and kc, which are critical for neutrophil accumulation in inflamed tissues  <cit> . they also found that a lack of tlr <dig> led to earlier death from pneumococcal meningitis  <cit> . in the present study, however, neutrophil accumulation and tnf-α, il-1β, il-17a and mip- <dig> synthesis in the lungs after infection with s. pneumoniae were not significantly different between wt and dectin-2ko mice. by contrast, the engulfment of pneumococcus by neutrophils was significantly impaired in dectin-2ko mice compared with wt mice. these results suggest that dectin- <dig> may be involved in the phagocytic killing of s. pneumoniae by neutrophils rather than in the accumulation of these cells. recently, a similar observation was reported by albiger et al., which addressed the role of tlr <dig> in the host defense against s. pneumoniae infection  <cit> . tlr9ko mice were significantly more susceptible to this infection than wt mice, probably as a result of the impaired phagocytic killing of this bacterium by macrophages.

earlier observations demonstrated that the prognosis of bacteremia following pneumococcal pneumonia was improved in the early phase of infection, which might be related to the development of specific anti-capsular ab  <cit> . opsonization of this bacterium by igg specific to the capsular polysaccharides is a key step in the neutrophil-mediated host defense against this infection  <cit> . ti- <dig> ag, including pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides, typically elicits a rapid extrafollicular igg response with limited isotype class switching from igm to igg, affinity maturation of immunoglobulin and memory b cell response  <cit> . however, our recent study demonstrated that the serum levels of serotype-specific igg against pneumococcal polysaccharide ag were increased in mice immunized with ppv  <cit> . similar observations were reported by other investigators  <cit> . pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides have been shown to produce serotype-specific igg, irrespective of their features as ti- <dig> ag. in a clinical study, verbinnen and co-workers demonstrated that b-1-like b cells producing serotype-specific igg were significantly increased in the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers as early as day  <dig> after immunization with ppv  <cit> . in addition, haas and co-workers demonstrated that b- <dig> b cells were involved in the protection during early responses against s. pneumoniae infection through the synthesis of igg <dig> to ti- <dig> ag  <cit> . although b cell subsets producing igg <dig> remain to be examined, the present data demonstrated that dectin- <dig> was involved in the production of serotype-specific igg <dig> in balf as early as 24 h after infection was significantly reduced in dectin-2ko mice compared with wt mice.

earlier investigations reported the involvement of ifn-γ in isotype class switching of igm to igg <dig> in b cells upon stimulation with ti- <dig> ag  <cit> , although in the current study, it remains unclear whether igg <dig> was produced as a result of class-switching from igm because of equivalent anti-pps <dig> igm in balf between wt and dectin-2ko mice. in addition, marchi and co-workers demonstrated that ifn-γ enhanced opsonized zymosan phagocytosis and ros release by neutrophils  <cit> . recently, we reported that a defect in dectin- <dig> led to reduced ifn-γ production by nkt cells during immunization with ppv  <cit> . similarly, in the present study, ifn-γ synthesis in the lungs was significantly attenuated in dectin-2ko mice compared with wt mice after infection with s. pneumoniae. thus, ifn-γ may play a pivotal role in regulating the phagocytic killing by neutrophils as a downstream event in dectin-2-mediated recognition of pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides. previously, we demonstrated that il- <dig> plays an important role in host defense against pneumococcal infection by promoting the production of ifn-γ  <cit> . in the present study, dectin- <dig> was essential for triggering il-12p <dig> production by dcs upon simulation with s. pneumoniae culture supernatant, which supports the above hypothesis.

the cona-bound fraction in s. pneumoniae culture supernatant induced il-12p <dig> production by bm-dcs, and this activity was completely abrogated when bm-dcs were derived from dectin-2ko mice. these results suggest that certain cona-bound moieties of the capsular polysaccharides may be involved in dectin-2-mediated recognition of s. pneumoniae. in earlier studies, lee and co-workers demonstrated that dectin- <dig> had an ability to bind glc-, gal-, glcnac- and galnac-bsa, in addition to the usual man- and fuc-bsa  <cit> . additionally, cona has been known to bind molecules that contain α-d-mannose, α-d-glucose and sterically related residues with available c- <dig>  c- <dig> or c- <dig> hydroxyl groups  <cit> . these previous findings suggest that some glucosyl residue in the capsular polysaccharides might be recognized by dectin- <dig>  further investigations are necessary to define the precise polysaccharide structure that contributes to s. pneumoniae recognition through dectin- <dig> 

among different s. pneumoniae serotypes, capsular polysaccharide structures are not identical  <cit> . mcgreal and co-workers previously reported that serotype  <dig> capsular polysaccharide inhibited the interaction between dectin- <dig> and mannans, whereas other serotypes, such as  <dig>  9 v,  <dig>  18c and 19 f, did not show such an effect  <cit> , suggesting a distinct role for dectin- <dig> in the recognition of different s. pneumoniae serotypes. in the present study, we used only a serotype  <dig> strain of s. pneumoniae, and therefore, these findings may not be generalizable to all pneumococcal infections.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we demonstrate that dectin-2ko mice were more susceptible to infection with a serotype  <dig> strain of s. pneumoniae than wt mice, as shown by a shorter survival time, larger bacterial burden and lower ifn-γ production in the lungs of dectin-2ko mice. our results suggest that dectin-2-dependent il- <dig> production may contribute to ifn-γ synthesis and subsequent production of serotype-specific anti-capsular polysaccharide igg after s. pneumoniae serotype  <dig> infection, which may promote opsonization of this bacterium for engulfment. thus, the present study may provide important implications for better understanding in the host defense mechanism against s. pneumoniae serotype  <dig> and for developing more effective vaccine strategies against this infection.
