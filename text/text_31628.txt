BACKGROUND
understanding how individuals respond to ever-changing environments is of fundamental importance in all organisms. plants encounter various biotic and abiotic stresses throughout their life span. one of the most dramatic abiotic stresses is flooding  <cit> . plants cannot actively escape a flooding environment due to their immobile character  <cit> , and many plants are injured or killed by flooding events due to oxygen shortage in their cells  <cit> . however, over the long period of adaptive evolution, plants have evolved the capacity to survive flooding habitats via escape phenotypes, e.g., the shoot elongation, the formation of aerenchyma, and the induction of gas films  <cit> . recently, the molecular mechanisms of physiology and metabolic modulation behind these adaptive traits have been investigated in crops and wetland plants . however, few such studies have been conducted on true aquatics, floating-leaved or submerged aquatic plants  <cit> , which are specialized to life in water and likely have different responding mechanisms to flooding compared with other plants.

the fringed water lily nymphoides peltata  kuntze is a typical floating-leaved plant with a widespread distribution in temperate and subtropical regions of eurasia  <cit> . nymphoides peltata usually roots in the bottom mud and maintains its leaves afloat on the water surface with the connection of petioles. when subjected to flooding, the leaves of n. peltata can rapidly reach the water surface by rapid elongation of the petioles  <cit> , an ability that is also present in many other floating-leaved plants  <cit> . this trait makes n. peltata an ideal aquatic species for investigating the molecular mechanisms of plants to avoid submergence stress. previous study showed that ethylene played a major role in the case where submergence promotes petiole elongation in n. peltata  <cit> . which is similar with many aquatic or flooding-tolerant species, e.g., rumex palustris  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms of flood-adaption in n. peltata still remain unclear. as a non-model plant, genomic information of n. peltata is scarce, except for the development of several molecular markers  <cit> , which hinders the exploration of the underlying flood-adaption mechanisms in this plant. with the emergence of next-generation sequencing technologies, a new technology rna-seq  independent of genetic background has been developed  <cit> . recently, rna-seq has been utilized to elucidate the response of non-model plants to various environmental stresses, including flooding and waterlogging .

in this study, we examined the global gene expression changes of n. peltata under both normal and flooding conditions using illumina rna-seq technology. the results provide a comprehensive view of the complex molecular events involved in the response of floating-leaved plants to flooding stress and expand our understanding of response to flooding stress.

RESULTS
illumina sequencing and assembly
in total,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads were obtained from the untreated sample  and the treated sample , respectively . assembly of those reads from us and ts separately generated  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes, respectively . the strategy of pooling all clean reads from us and ts together generated  <dig>  unigenes with a n <dig> length of 1449 bp after assembly . the number of unigenes from the pooled strategy was larger than those from separate assemble because some unigenes with low expression levels generated with the pooled strategy cannot be found when using strategy of separate assemble due to their less reads. among these  <dig>  unigenes, the total number of unigenes longer than 500 bp was  <dig> , accounting for  <dig> % of all unigenes . the detailed length distribution of  <dig>  unigenes predicted from the pooled assembly can be also found in additional file  <dig> table  <dig> overview of transcriptome sequencing and unigene annotations

gene annotation and functional classification
unigenes generated using the pooled strategy were used for further analysis. among these  <dig>  unigenes, a total of  <dig>   unigenes were annotated . according to the ncbi non-redundant proteins  annotation,  <dig>   unigenes had homologous proteins in the nr protein database . meanwhile, unigenes were also matched with go category, and  <dig>   unigenes were assigned to one or more go terms . using go annotation, the functions of the unigenes were divided into three categories: biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. to obtain a detailed view of the go classification, each go category was further clustered to its parent term . the results indicate that most of the sequenced genes were responsible for fundamental biological regulation and metabolism.

furthermore, the possible functions of  <dig>  unigenes were predicted using searches against the cluster of orthologous groups  database as well as swiss-prot protein sequence  database. a total of  <dig>  unigenes were matched with the cog database  and classified into  <dig> specific categories . the “general function prediction only” was the largest group , followed by “posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones”  and “signal transduction mechanisms”  . we also obtained  <dig>  hits when searched against swissprot protein database with an e-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  covering  <dig> % of all unigenes . all the deduced protein sequences corresponding to the predicted coding dna sequences  were listed in additional file  <dig>  kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway analysis was also conducted to predict the function of the unigenes during the development process. in total,  <dig>  unigenes were found to be involved in  <dig> pathways .

we also used the phytozome database  to annotate unigenes. similar as the nr database, the percent of annotated unigenes was about 43% , which is much lower than a normal annotation percentage 70% in other plants. to examine whether these unannotated unigenes were non-coding rna genes or lineage-specific genes, we predicted sequences of the unannotated unigenes and found that most of them have predicted cds. we further used the unannotated unigenes as queries to search against the plant noncoding rnas database and found that only a small proportion of unigenes matched the sequences in the noncoding rnas database . therefore, most of the unannotated unigenes were inferred to be nymphoides peltata lineage-specific genes.

comparison between treated and untreated samples
functional annotation and cog classification for the separately assembled unigenes for samples ts and us was also conducted after annotation of unigenes using the pooled strategy, the results were shown in fig.  <dig>  the number of unigenes in each category for go and cog annotation showed parallel proportion between these two samples, indicating that transcriptomes of sample ts and us were comparable.fig.  <dig> go  and cog  annotation. a go annotation of the assembled unigenes for the treated sample  and the untreated sample  separately, the functions of the unigenes were divided into three categories. b information of cog classification for the treated sample  and the untreated sample  separately, the unigenes were mainly clustered into  <dig> components




furthermore, we listed the top  <dig> ranked unigenes with high expression level in sample ts and the corresponding unigenes in sample us . among these  <dig> unigenes,  <dig> were degs, which encoded proteins mainly involved in osmoregulation  and proline-rich protein . the former is very helpful in the regulation of water homeostasis and water transport, and the latter is a cell wall protein of plant regulating plant wound and defense responses. as for the other  <dig> unigenes, they were mainly involved in photosynthesis process  and antioxidant process  .table  <dig> the top  <dig> ranked unigenes  in the ts sample and the corresponding unigenes in the us sample

transcriptome changes of nymphoides peltata and five other plants in response to flooding
to gain a broad picture of plant responses to flooding, we listed transcriptome changes of nymphoides peltata and five other plants to cope with flooding in table  <dig>  it appears that common responses to flooding in transcriptome were involved in glycolysis, the antioxidant process, the fermentation and the present of group vii ethylene response factor transcription factors  . by contrast, expression changes of the alanine metabolism under submergence were only observed in n. peltata and lotus japonicas . as a species of true aquatic plant, n. peltata remained active photosynthesis under submergence, which has not been reported in other plants .table  <dig> transcriptome changes of nymphoides peltata  and five other plants in response to flooding

molecular adaptation of aquatic plants compared with non-aquatic plants
to identify molecular adaptation in aquatic plants and help understand flooding response in plants, we applied a likelihood approach to detect molecular adaptation by estimating the ratio  of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates. our dataset contained three aquatic plants and five non-aquatic plants. within the aquatic plants, one  has a draft genome, and the remaining two  have transcriptome data. by contrast, all five non-aquatic plants  possess available genome sequences. a total of  <dig> one-to-one orthologous genes were identified in our dataset. using an established species tree from the angiosperm phylogeny website , we tested the possibility of differential selection between aquatic and non-aquatic plants, by comparing a one-ratio model with a two-ratio model. the one-ratio model assumes a uniform ω ratio across all plants, while the two-ratio model assumes two ω ratios: all non-aquatic plants have ω <dig>  whereas all aquatic plants have ω <dig>  our analyses yielded  <dig> genes with significantly higher evolutionary rates in aquatic plants , indicating that these genes may play important roles in adaptation to aquatic environments. notably, two of these genes were outstanding for their antioxidant role. one is the gene encoding nat <dig> , which is involved in the ascorbate transport and the ascorbate play an important role in antioxidant  <cit>  . the other gene is cat <dig> encoding an enzyme catalase- <dig>  which is an anti-oxidant enzyme to protect cells from the toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide  <cit>  .

validation of the rna-seq data
to verify our rna-seq data, the expression levels of eight unigenes were examined by quantitative real-time pcr  experiment. of the eight genes, two genes are known to encode glutathione s-transferases  and glutathione peroxidases , which are antioxidant enzymes ; two genes encode photosystem i subunit xi  and photosynthetic electron transport ferredoxin , which are associated with photosynthesis process ; four genes encode alcohol dehydrogenase , lactate dehydrogenase , alanine aminotransferase  and aspartate transaminase , which are involved in carbohydrate metabolism, including fermentative pathway and a modified tricarboxylic acid cycle mode - alanine metabolism . all eight genes exhibited higher expression level in response to flooding , indicating that these genes are indeed stimulated by flooding stress. in addition, their expression changes measured from qrt-pcr were consistent with those estimated from the rna-seq data .table  <dig> validation of the degs with qrt-pcr experiment

discussion
in this study, using the rna-seq technology, transcriptome changes of n. peltata were obtained under both normal and flooding conditions. in total,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> high-quality reads were acquired for us and ts sample, respectively. gene annotation towards various databases  was conducted after reads assembly. after calculation of gene expression for each unigene and a strict criterion, a total of  <dig> unigenes were defined as degs, which were either induced or depressed by flooding stress. besides, the top  <dig> ranked differentially expressed unigenes were mainly involved in antioxidant, photosynthesis and protein-related activity. in addition, go enrichment and kegg enrichment analysis of degs also presented processes involved in carbohydrate source , self-protection area  and energy supplier . moreover, the molecular adaptation of the aquatic plants compared with non-aquatic plants suggested that genes involved in anti-oxidant processes having significantly higher evolutionary rates in aquatic plants. these findings indicate that processes mentioned above play important roles in response of n. peltata to flooding.

when plants under flooding pressure, many physiological responses will be induced. ethylene release was one of these responses. previous studies showed that the shoot elongation strategy was mainly driven by ethylene, such as rice and rumex  <cit> . in n. peltata, the shoot elongation was also driven by ethylene and has been physiologically validated  <cit> . in addition, the cell number was increased to a large number, which contributed to the rapid elongation. our transcriptome results identified some ethylene response factors and some cell cycle related genes such as cdc <dig> and cafp, which proved the fact that ethylene release was induced by flooding as a physiological response. moreover, flooding often leads plants to oxygen shortage situation, which can induce ros generation, and anti-oxidant enzymes were activated to protect the cell membrane  <cit> . in n. peltata, though we were not able to detect enzyme activity, we can infer that the activity of antioxidant enzymes was induced under flooding stress. several antioxidant genes such as gst and gpx and two fast evolving genes nat <dig> and cat <dig> involved in anti-oxidant were identified, indicating an activated ros elimination process. taken together, these results validated the physiological response of n. peltata under flooding stress.

plants are challenged by various abiotic stresses. the increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species , including singlet oxygen, superoxide radicals, and hydrogen peroxide, is a key signature of abiotic stress at the molecular level  <cit> . to resist this harmful effect, plants employ a system that catalyzes the elimination of ros and fights with oxidative damage via the formation of antioxidant enzymes, such as gst and gpx . in the present study, the expression of degs encoding antioxidant enzymes gst and gpx was greatly larger than that under normal conditions, which has been validated by the qrt-pcr experiment . consistently, many antioxidant enzymes have been shown to be essential for plant survival during adaptive responses to waterlogging or flooding stress . therefore, these antioxidant enzymes may be induced by flooding stress and critical for the survival of n. peltata in a submerged environment.

when plants live in a submerged environment, both light and carbon supplies are limited due to the slower diffusion rates in water  <cit> , which decreases plant photosynthesis performance. however, photosynthesis is important for plant survival, which makes the continuation of aerobic respiration through the elevated oxygen concentrations possible. the aerobic respiration is more efficient compared with anaerobic metabolism  <cit> . for n. peltata, transcriptome analysis revealed that many photosynthesis processes were predominantly enriched in go terms  and kegg pathways , suggesting the continuation of photosynthesis under flooding stress. previous studies showed that submerged plants have physiological adaptation mechanisms termed carbon-concentrating mechanisms  to produce more co <dig>  <cit> , including use of hco3
− and crassulacean acid metabolism   <cit> . moreover, the use of hco3
− as a co <dig> substrate is a common way for most true aquatic plants  <cit> . therefore, the continuation of photosynthesis of n. peltata under submergence may be attributed to the mechanism of using hco3−. in addition, species that have leaf gas films or that can produce new leaves under waterlogging often have higher co <dig> affinity and higher co <dig> concentrations  <cit> . therefore, the similar ability of n. peltata to produce new acclimated leaves during submergence might also contribute to the continuation of photosynthesis underwater. although the activation of photosynthesis was indicated by our petiole transcriptional data, further studies should be added to draw a reliable conclusion on photosynthesis of n. peltata under flooding stress.

large amounts of energy and carbohydrate are required for the rapid submergence-induced petiole elongation of n. peltata. the initial response to a submergence environment is the induction of anaerobic metabolism  <cit> . for n. peltata, many degs involved in the fermentative pathway were identified and also the glycolysis process and pyruvate metabolism  was predominantly in the go and kegg enrichment analysis . the similar performance of these two enzymes stimulated by waterlogging has also been reported in other plants  <cit> , indicating that the fermentative pathway was likely activated to provide essential energy. however, this universal anoxia metabolism has a side effect: low efficiency  <cit> . considering the active and rapid response of n. peltata to flooding stress, there should be alternative metabolic forms with high efficiency to supply the energy required. moreover, in order to keep the efficiency in glycolysis under oxygen deficiency, it is important to remove accumulated pyruvate. the enzyme alaat  can transform pyruvate into alanine, and increased alanine accumulation, which is correlated with enhanced activity of alaat, under anoxic conditions has been reported in other plants  <cit> . this process is also likely present in n. peltata because degs encoding alaat were identified and their up-regulation expression level was validated by the qrt-pcr experiment . in addition, a modified tricarboxylic acid  cycle mode-alanine metabolism was found to be induced by waterlogging in lotus japonicus  <cit> . the yield produced from the metabolic reprogramming associated with alanine metabolism  doubled energy produced from glycolysis   <cit> . another degs encoding critical enzyme in alanine metabolism, aspat , whose expression level was validated by the qrt-pcr, indicating that alanine metabolism was likely induced as energy source by flooding in n. peltata.

it is well known that ethylene is one of the main drivers for depth adaptation in flooding-tolerant plants  <cit> . furthermore, group vii ethylene response factors  were identified to activate the expression of hypoxia-related genes by an n-end rule pathway under low oxygen conditions  <cit> . gviierf proteins were found in many plants such as arabidopsis thaliana, oryza sativa and rumex palustris . in n. peltata, we identified  <dig> gviierfs with the characteristic mcggail amino-terminus in our transcriptome assembly. indeed, gviierfs were found in other aquatic plants as ranunculus bungei and utricularia gibba, even can be found in the marine angiosperm zostera marina by searching its genome sequence. these findings indicate that the oxygen sensing mechanism via gviierfs may be conserved in n. peltata and in other higher plants. notably, we didn’t find gviierfs in the differential gene sets of n. peltata, possibly because of our long-duration sampling. specifically, in this study we were mainly interested in the expression changes of unigenes at the time point of the seventh day, which may be too late to detect the expression changes of gviierfs. indeed, the release of ethylene is an earlier signal in response to flooding  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, comprehensive and valuable genomic resources were built by comparative transcriptome of petioles under normal and flooding conditions of nymphoides peltata. our data suggests that two processes rarely occurred in other flooding-tolerant plants, active photosynthesis and alanine metabolism, are likely contributed to the active response of n. peltata to flooding stress. these results deepen our understanding of the genetic basis underlying the response to flooding stress in aquatic plants. the response of plants to abiotic stresses is a complex network functioning with the regulation of stress-related genes  <cit> , therefore, further investigations are still essential to detail the active responses of aquatic plants to flooding stress.
