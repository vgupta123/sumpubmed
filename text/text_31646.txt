BACKGROUND
the spatiotemporal integration of tactile inputs from different skin regions and across body parts is an important function of human somatosensory cortex. for example, the integration of inputs across the digits is vital for the successful manual manipulation and identification of objects. however, the mechanism of this integration is not well understood. good candidates for the performance of this function are the second somatosensory area, s <dig>  and the parietal ventral area, pv. these two fields are mirror symmetric representations of the body's surface  <cit> , joined at the representation of the hand. because it is difficult to distinguish between the hand representations of s <dig> and pv using functional imaging techniques we refer to this region as s2/pv.

electrophysiological recording studies in monkeys indicate that neuronal receptive fields in s <dig>  <cit>  and pv  <cit>  are large, encompassing multiple digits or even the entire hand. further, these receptive fields are often bilateral, including, for example, both the contra- and ipsilateral hand. studies of neuroanatomical connections also show that, beside the local homotopic connections in the ipsilateral hemisphere, both s <dig>  <cit>  and pv  <cit>  have dense bilateral connections.

there is also evidence from human imaging studies that inputs from different skin regions interact in s2/pv. for example, bilateral integration of inputs from the hands takes place in human s2/pv  <cit> . in addition, the activation in human s <dig> evoked by stimulation of one finger can be modulated by simultaneous  <cit>  or non-simultaneous  <cit>  stimulation of other fingers of the same hand.

another possibility is that integration of inputs from different skin regions takes place, at least to some extent, in anterior parietal areas 3a, 3b,  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . previous meg studies have confirmed that tactile stimulation to the human finger evokes responses in both contralateral anterior parietal fields as well as bilateral s2/pv  <cit> . each finger has a distinguishable somatotopic representation in contralateral anterior parietal cortex  <cit> . however, there is some evidence that interaction among digit representations may also occur in anterior parietal cortex. for example, the strength of the early response to stimulation of a single finger was attenuated by simultaneous  <cit>  or non-simultaneous stimulation of another finger at short  isis  <cit> . further, the magnitude of spatial integration decreased with the distance of separation of the digit representations in anterior parietal fields  <cit> . there is also evidence from electrophysiological recording  <cit>  and optical imaging  <cit>  studies in monkeys that simultaneous stimuli from different skin regions could be merged together into a single activation zone in anterior parietal cortex.

however, in contrast to s2/pv, human meg studies suggest that responses in anterior parietal cortex to stimulation of one hand are not affected by stimulation of the opposite hand  <cit> . this finding is supported by neuroanatomical results in monkeys indicating that the hand representation in 3b is largely acallosal  <cit> . previous meg work also suggests that the spatial integration of inputs across the digits is much stronger in s2/pv than in anterior parietal fields  <cit> . however, the extent of spatial integration in s2/pv, and the difference in extent and timing of integration between anterior parietal fields and s2/pv has not been quantified. these differences may represent different steps in the complex process of spatiotemporal integration.

in this study, we measured somatosensory evoked fields  during non-simultaneous tactile stimulation of digits of both hands with an oddball paradigm. we compared the extent of spatial integration in the hand representations in human s2/pv and anterior parietal fields, and discuss the difference in the timing of integration in these two areas.

RESULTS
contra- and ipsilateral responses to index finger stimulation
1). dipole orientation and localization
in all subjects, dipoles were fit for both the early  and late  response windows. figure  <dig> contains the actual contour plots of meg sensor data and the plots of the averaged magnetic fields measured using  <dig> axial gradiometers from a single right-handed subject showing responses to index finger stimulation . the left and right columns show responses to right index finger  and left index finger  stimulation, respectively. identified dipole sources of responses in the right hemisphere were superimposed on this subject's mri and are shown in figure  <dig> 

interestingly, bilateral activation appeared during both early and late time periods in this subject for both ld <dig> and rd <dig> stimulation, though the early responses were of larger amplitude and shorter latency in the contralateral  versus the ipsilateral  hemisphere. the dipole direction and location of the ipsilateral  response to ld <dig> stimulation were similar to those of the contralateral  response to rd <dig> stimulation and likewise for the right hemisphere responses. the dipole directions tended to be mirror images in the two hemispheres. dipole analysis and co-registration of the meg localization information with the mri scans verified that the anterior parietal area  was the primary contributor to both contralateral and ipsilateral early  responses and that the s <dig> region  was the primary contributor to the late  responses in this subject .

the average current dipole positions were specified in talairach coordinates : the early contralateral response dipoles in left and right hemispheres were  and ; the late contralateral response dipoles in left and right hemispheres were  and , respectively. these localizations in talairach space were consistent with the locations of anterior parietal fields and s2/pv in both hemispheres.

early ipsilateral responses for ld <dig> stimulation were found in 12/ <dig> right- and 2/ <dig> left-handed subjects, while 7/ <dig> right- and 2/ <dig> left-handed subjects showed early ipsilateral responses to stimulation of rd <dig>  figure  <dig> shows two more examples of early ipsilateral responses . the source of early ipsilateral responses was identified in anterior parietal fields. late ipsilateral responses were recorded from all  <dig> subjects. like the late contralateral responses, the late ipsilateral responses also originated from the upper banks of the sylvian fissure, in the s <dig> region.

2). latency
the peak latencies of responses from a single subject  are shown in figure  <dig>  the early contralateral responses from both hemispheres of the same subject peaked at  <dig> ms, while late contralateral responses peaked at about  <dig> ms . early and late ipsilateral responses in the right hemisphere peaked at  <dig> and  <dig> ms . the early ipsilateral responses in the left hemisphere peaked at  <dig> ms. later responses, which looked more complex with multiple peaks, peaked around  <dig> ms . thus, both early and late ipsilateral response peaks appeared later than contralateral peaks in both hemispheres in this subject.

the average early and late contralateral response latencies for all subjects  were not significantly different across hemispheres . the ipsilateral early  and late  responses appeared significantly later than contralateral early  and late  responses in all subjects. the mean delay of the early ipsilateral responses relative to the contralateral responses was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms , while the delay of the late ipsilateral responses relative to the contralateral responses was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms . the mean difference between delays for the early versus late responses was not significant .

3). amplitude
the subject's data from figure  <dig> clearly show the early ipsilateral responses above the noise level . the amplitudes of this subject's early ipsilateral responses were  <dig>  and  <dig>  ft , while the noise levels were  <dig>  and  <dig>  ft , in the left and right hemispheres, respectively. the average amplitude of the early ipsilateral response  across all subjects was significantly higher  than the average noise level  based on the pre-stimulation period of  <dig> ms.

the average amplitude of early and late responses for all subjects did not show a significant difference between hemispheres , nor was there a significant difference in amplitude of response for right- versus left-handers . as the strength of early and late responses did not show a significant difference between hemispheres, the responses to left and right hand stimulation were combined for further analysis.

the mean amplitude of the early response was significantly smaller  for the early ipsilateral response  than for the early contralateral response . similarly, the late ipsilateral response  was significantly weaker  than the late contralateral response . further, the mean amplitude of the early contralateral response  was not significantly different from the late contralateral response , while the late ipsilateral response  was significantly stronger than the early ipsilateral response .

spatial integration between digit representations
1). latency
2). amplitude
in an example subject, low rate index finger stimulation  clearly elicited both early and later responses . the response amplitude was markedly decreased for high rate stimulation , and the late response  almost disappeared in both hemispheres . the intervened standard stimuli  suppressed the late response for d <dig>  stimulation in both hemispheres. there appeared to be the greatest attenuation for the same  digit high rate stimulation compared to alternate standard digit  stimulation, and greater attenuation for adjacent  compared to non-adjacent  digit stimulation . the standard stimuli reduced the amplitude of the early response for d <dig>  stimulation in some conditions for this subject .

grand averaged sensor amplitude  and dipole moment  response values to deviant stimuli are displayed in figure  <dig>  both sensor and moment values of early responses were statistically significantly smaller for high rate index finger stimulation  compared to low rate index finger stimulation . both contralateral and ipsilateral early amplitude of responses to single finger stimulation  were not significantly affected by stimulation of the other fingers .

as with the early responses, sensor and moment values of the late responses were statistically significantly smaller for high rate index finger stimulation  compared to low rate index finger stimulation . the late response decreased more than the early response regardless of handedness .

further, the intervened standard stimuli  significantly reduced the late contralateral and ipsilateral responses to deviant  stimuli. in the contralateral hemisphere this effect was greater for the adjacent finger  compared to the non-adjacent fingers . the attenuation of the late contralateral response was significantly greater for the same finger high rate stimulation  compared to non-adjacent finger  stimulation. for the ipsilateral response, there were no differences in amplitude reduction related to the location of intervened standard stimulation. only opposite d <dig> stimulation differed from high rate d <dig> stimulation in the late ipsilateral response. the suppressive effect of opposite d <dig> stimulation was significantly stronger for the contralateral than the ipsilateral late response .

discussion
in summary, we examined the spatiotemporal integration across digit representations within anterior parietal somatosensory areas and s2/pv, as well as interhemispheric integration, using non-simultaneous tactile stimulation. we have shown 1) spatial integration of responses in s2/pv, with a decrease in interaction with the increase in separation of digit representations; 2) greater temporal integration of inputs within one digit representation in s2/pv versus anterior parietal fields; 3) both contra- and ipsilateral early responses in anterior parietal fields to cutaneous mechanical stimulation. the early ipsilateral response has a longer latency and lower amplitude than the early contralateral response; and 4) processing of cutaneous inputs is symmetrical across hemispheres. what follows is a discussion of these findings in light of previous work from human and non-human primates.

spatiotemporal integration between digit representations in s2/pv
the distance-dependence of spatial integration between digit representations in the s2/pv area was examined in this study. we found that the amplitude of the contralateral late responses to deviant stimuli  decreased when standard stimuli  were intervened. like the distance-dependence of spatial integration in anterior parietal areas  <cit> , the attenuation decreased with the increasing distance of separation between receptive fields, toward greater attenuation for adjacent fingers  compared to non-adjacent fingers .

in agreement with previous meg work on digit response interaction in s2/pv  <cit> , our data show that the standard stimuli significantly attenuate responses in bilateral s2/pv to deviant  stimulation. the pattern of spatial integration in s2/pv is consistent with the fact that neurons in s <dig> and pv have large receptive fields, frequently encompassing multiple digits  <cit> , while cells in anterior parietal areas do not  <cit> .

we also found significant temporal integration in the s2/pv region. the amplitude of the late response was smaller for high rate versus low rate index finger stimulation, and the late responses decreased more than the early responses with high rate stimulation, as previous sep  <cit>  and sef  <cit>  investigations have shown. this result is consistent with previous studies revealing the shorter recovery cycle or refractory period for neurons in anterior parietal areas than in s <dig>  <cit> .

some non-human primate studies have suggested serial information processing from anterior parietal areas to s2/pv  <cit> , with tactile inputs from anterior parietal fields converging onto s <dig>  <cit> . however, other studies suggest hierarchical equivalence of anterior parietal areas and s <dig> for tactile processing in cats and new-world primates  <cit> . to date, the debate about serial versus parallel organization of somatosensory cortex in humans is unresolved. both early  <cit>  and late  <cit>  concurrent activities in anterior parietal and lateral sulcal areas have been reported in humans. in contrast, a recent meg study revealed that the onset latency of response following transcutaneous electrical stimulation was longer in s2/pv than in anterior parietal areas  <cit> . however, we cannot rule out the contribution of activity in s2/pv to early responses and anterior parietal areas to late responses. it is possible that both serial and parallel processing play a role in tactile perception.

serial convergence may account for the spatial and temporal specialties in s2/pv. unlike anterior parietal areas with restricted and defined neural receptive fields, the large, complex receptive fields within s2/pv may play an important role in integrating tactile inputs over space and time. for example, the digit representations in s <dig> and surrounding fields lack fine somatotopy, and some cells responded better to proprioceptive rather than cutaneous stimuli  <cit> . in addition, studies have found that 23% of cells in the s <dig> region were orientation tuned, often across multiple digit pads  <cit> . these receptive field properties, tuned for relatively long-range spatial and temporal integration, go some way towards explaining s2's purported involvement in functions like tactile object exploration and identification  <cit> , bimanual coordination  <cit> , and tactile learning and memory  <cit> . consistent with this idea is evidence in humans that damage to parietotemporal cortices  causes impairment of tactile object recognition in the absence of basic somesthetic dysfunction  <cit> .

spatiotemporal integration between digit representations in anterior parietal somatosensory areas
we found that the amplitude of responses in anterior parietal areas to deviant alone stimuli applied to a single digit was significantly lower at high rate  versus low rate  stimulation, as previous studies  <cit>  have shown. this decrease of amplitude resulting from increased rate of stimulation was much smaller in anterior parietal areas than in s2/pv. however, the average amplitude of early responses in anterior parietal areas for deviant stimulation did not show a significant decrease when the standard stimuli were interleaved between deviants , though the amplitude decrease was seen in some cases. previous work using non-simultaneous stimuli with long isis  also showed similar results  <cit> . however, an interaction between digit representations has been reported in anterior parietal areas when using simultaneous  <cit>  or non-simultaneous stimuli with short  isis  <cit> . these findings are in line with the short recovery cycle time constant  for neurons in anterior parietal areas, which was estimated by fitting an exponential curve to sef intensities for responses to electrical stimulation of the median nerve with different isis   <cit> . with a long isi, the intervened standard inputs may arrive out of the recovery period of neurons in anterior parietal areas, with little effect on responses to deviant stimuli.

it is known that there is an inhibitory surround structure of receptive fields in monkey area 3b  <cit> . a three-component model has been proposed in which a lagged inhibitory surround overlaps the excitatory center and its one or more fixed inhibitory flankers. the fixed  and lagged  surround inhibitory components confer the spatial and temporal selectivity of neurons in anterior parietal areas  <cit> . the spatiotemporal property of inhibitory surround structure of neural receptive fields may account for the restricted neural receptive field and rapid recovery cycle in anterior parietal areas observed in the present study.

ipsilateral responses in anterior parietal areas
in the present investigation we clearly recorded early ipsilateral responses with high goodness-of-fit to single finger tactile stimulation . though the amplitude of the ipsilateral response was very weak in some cases, on average it was  <dig>  times greater than the noise level. an ipsilateral response from anterior parietal field has also been observed in a small number of subjects in several previous studies  <cit>  using meg or eeg to measure responses to median nerve stimulations. a growing body of evidence from monkey studies  <cit>  and human fmri studies  <cit>  also report ipsilateral responses in anterior parietal fields, suggesting that anterior parietal fields receive tactile input from the ipsilateral hand. ipsilateral responses were relatively robust in our study, likely due to the cutaneous mechanical stimulation used in our experiment. recent fmri studies on both monkeys and humans have shown that responses from ipsilateral anterior parietal areas are more robust for mechanical versus median nerve electrical stimulation  <cit> .

single cell recordings from monkeys indicate that some neurons representing multiple digits in areas  <dig> and  <dig> have bilateral or ipsilateral receptive fields  <cit> , and a few nociceptive neurons at the junction of areas 3b and  <dig> have large, bilateral receptive fields  <cit> . thus the source of the early ipsilateral response is likely not only area 3b, but may also include input from cells in area  <dig>  and possibly areas  <dig> and  <dig> as well. recent evidence from electrophysiological recording in monkeys suggests that responses from ipsilateral anterior parietal fields are elicited by feedback rather than feedforward afferents  <cit> , which may be related to the latency delay of the ipsilateral response observed in previous sep  <cit>  and the current meg study. it has been suggested that transcallosal pathways may mediate responses from ipsilateral anterior parietal areas both in humans  <cit>  and in monkeys  <cit> . however, anatomical evidence from macaque monkeys indicates that anterior parietal areas, in particular area 3b, have sparse or absent callosal connections for the hand representation  <cit> . callosal connections become denser in the more caudal fields, from areas 3b to  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . thus, transcallosal pathways mediating the early ipsilateral responses would be through these caudal areas, or s2/pv.

hemispheric differences
in addition, some previous functional imaging studies suggest functional dominance, or an increased source amplitude, in the left versus the right hemisphere in human primary  <cit>  and secondary  <cit>  somatosensory cortex. an expanded hand representation in left anterior parietal fields has also been proposed  <cit> . however, morphometric and cytoarchitectonic measurements show no lateralized differences in somatosensory cortices  <cit> . psychophysical tests show no differences in spatial acuity between hands  <cit> , although there does appear to be a left-hemisphere advantage for tactile processing of simultaneity judgment  <cit> . furthermore, as in our study, previous somatosensory evoked potential studies show no difference in topography or response amplitude between the two hemispheres  <cit> . thus, it is necessary to reassess the hemispheric asymmetry of somatosensory cortex.

the differences between studies may be due to the different types of stimuli used. the electrical stimulation used in previous studies showing asymmetry is not receptor specific, and elicits a more complex cortical activation. a recent meg study showed that movement might be involved in the lateral asymmetry of somatosensory cortex, and the intensity of electrical stimulation often exceeded the motor threshold in previous studies  <cit> . passive finger movement was found to evoke laterally asymmetrical responses in somatosensory cortex  <cit> . thus, the increased response in left somatosensory cortex evoked by electric stimulation may reflect the lateral asymmetry of movement rather than tactile information processing.

CONCLUSIONS
this human meg study revealed that the bilateral spatiotemporal integration in s2/pv takes place over a large cortical area and over a long time period. further, the strength of integration in this region is distance-dependent. the wide overlap of digit receptive fields in s2/pv might account for complex functions such as manual exploration and bimanual coordination, thought to be crucially dependent on s2/pv. in contrast, the properties of spatiotemporal integration in anterior parietal areas were different from those in s2/pv with significant temporal integration while spatial integration was reduced, which is consistent with the critical role of anterior parietal fields in spatial discrimination. the early ipsilateral response observed in over half of subjects suggests that anterior parietal fields do accept tactile inputs from the ipsilateral side of body. in addition, no tactile response difference between hemispheres indicated functional symmetry in human somatosensory cortex.
