BACKGROUND
spermatogenesis generates functional sperm cells from initially undifferentiated germ cells. this involves the proliferation of spermatogonia, meiosis of spermatocytes and the differentiation of spermatids into spermatozoa. it is a complex developmental program in which myriad events take place to ensure that the germ cells reach their proper stages of development at the appropriate times. normal spermatogenesis requires a well-regulated balance of several processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.

apoptosis is a key phenomenon during spermatogenesis. for instance, an early, massive wave of germ cell apoptosis occurs at puberty. this event takes place during postnatal weeks  <dig> to  <dig> in mice, with a peak after  <dig> weeks  <cit> . it is estimated that 75% of spermatogenic cells undergo apoptosis during development  <cit> , ensuring the maintenance of a critical ratio between maturing germ cells and sertoli cells  <cit> . sporadic apoptosis also occurs, primarily in spermatogonia and spermatocytes  <cit> , eliminating defective germ cells with mutated dna  <cit> .

the rhomboid family comprises polytopic membrane proteins, which may be the most widely-conserved membrane proteins identified to date  <cit> . they share conserved biochemical properties in all biological kingdoms. rhomboid proteases, which have been well studied in drosophila, appear to regulate egf receptor signalling pathways, thereby controlling growth and development  <cit> . in addition, some yeast rhomboid proteases have been found to play important roles in mitochondrial membrane remodelling  <cit> , while some parasite proteases containing a rhomboid domain are important for invasiveness  <cit> .

vertebrate rhomboid genes have been grouped into three classes:  active cellular rhomboids, including rhbdl <dig>  rhbdl <dig>  rhbdl <dig> and rhbdd <dig>  <cit> ;  inactive cellular rhomboids, including rhbdl <dig> and rhbdl6;  a mitochondrial rhomboid, parl  <cit> . however, the physiological functions of these proteases remain to be clarified. recently, rhbdl <dig> was found to cleave thrombomodulin and ephrin b <dig>  <cit> . an exciting finding in this field was the discovery of parl , the function of which appears to be associated with apoptosis  <cit> . drosophila rhomboid  <dig> is believed to be associated with spermatogenesis, as male mutants tend to be afflicted with familial sterility  <cit> .

mrhbdd <dig> is the first rhomboid serine protease known to be involved in mammalian spermatogenesis. we found that rhbdd <dig>  which contains a rhomboid domain, is highly expressed in testes and is involved in regulating apoptosis  <cit> . in the present study, the roles of mrhbdd <dig> in germ cell apoptosis and mouse spermatogenesis were investigated. we found that it is involved in regulating apoptosis in a mouse spermatagonia cell line, gc- <dig>  and is essential for their capacity to differentiate into spermatids in mouse seminiferous tubules.

RESULTS
mrhbdd <dig> and rrhbdd <dig> are polytopic genes that are highly expressed in testis
mrhbdd <dig> and rrhbdd <dig> were expressed in a variety of mouse and rat tissues, and the highest levels of gene products were found in the testis . previously, a human homolog, rhbdd <dig>  was also shown to be highly expressed in testes  <cit> . these findings suggest that this rhomboid-containing protein may be involved in regulating mammalian spermatogenesis.

apoptotic regulation of mrhbdd <dig> in a mouse spermatogonia line
in order to investigate this putative role of mrhbdd <dig> in spermatogenesis, we studied its expression in a mouse-derived spermatogonia cell line, gc- <dig> spg . stable mrhbdd <dig> knockdown shrna and negative control shrna gc- <dig> cells were constructed . because rhbdd <dig> regulates apoptosis in some somatic cells  <cit> , the occurrence of apoptosis in mrhbdd <dig> knockdown gc- <dig> cells was determined after challenges with apoptotic stimuli, ps <dig> and uv irradiation. procaspase  <dig> cleavage was indicated by an increase in p <dig> or p <dig>  its cleavage products during apoptosis. as shown in figure 2f and 2g, these apoptosis markers were more prominent in the mrhbdd <dig> knockdown gc- <dig> cells than in the negative control gc- <dig> cells after exposure to apoptosis inducers, ps <dig> and uv irradiation. we also confirmed by facs analysis that apoptosis increased in stable mrhbdd <dig> knockdown gc- <dig> cells after uv stimulation . these results indicate that mrhbdd <dig> normally inhibits apoptotic activity in spermatogonia.

endogenous mrhbdd <dig> knockdown in gc- <dig> cells does not affect their proliferation
to investigate the proliferation of mrhbdd <dig> knockdown gc- <dig> cells, mts and cck- <dig> assays were performed. proliferation did not differ between these cells and the negative control cells . thus, mrhbdd <dig> knockdown gc- <dig> cells possess normal survival and proliferation capacities under in vitro conditions.

stable mrhbdd <dig> knock-down gc- <dig> cells lose survival and differentiation capacities in mouse seminiferous tubules
the above experiments demonstrating the anti-apoptotic activity of mrhbdd <dig> in gc- <dig> cells suggested that this factor is associated with the survival of spermatogonia. to investigate an in vivo role for mrhbdd <dig>  mrhbdd <dig> knockdown gc- <dig> cells and negative control gc- <dig> cells were transplanted into mouse seminiferous tubules and their survival and differentiation into spermatids were studied. in this in vivo model, mrhbdd <dig> knockdown gc- <dig> cells with prnat-h <dig> /hygro-6# and negative control cells with prnat-h <dig> /hygro-negative  were transplanted into the seminiferous tubules of, respectively, right and left mouse testes, from which most of the endogenous germ cells had been eliminated by busulfan treatment. as shown in figure 4a and 4b, autologous and heterologous transplanted control cells, tagged by gfp, differentiated into spermatids, as shown by the presence of acrosomes . however, mrhbdd1-suppressed gc- <dig> cells did not survive or differentiate into spermatids, as shown by the absence of gfp and acrosomes from the epididymal tubules . in contrast, the mouse residual germ cells  that resisted busulfan treatment did differentiate into sperm cells, as shown by the presence of pna-rhodamine-labelled acrosomes . thus, mrhbdd <dig> knockdown apparently influences the survival of germ cells and their differentiation into sperm cells in vivo.

discussion
it is well established that the regulation of apoptosis is a key control mechanism for spermatogenesis  <cit> . an early wave of germinal cell apoptosis during the first round of spermatogenesis in the immature testis is probably a critical requirement during testis development because it maintains a balanced ratio of germ cells to sertoli cells  <cit> . moreover, the elimination of supra-optimal production of spermatogonia by apoptosis is common in the adult testis, where it is primarily restricted to spermatogonia  <cit> . however, apoptosis of defective germ cells is also essential for maintaining genetic fidelity in the development and survival of offspring. rhbdd1/mrhbdd <dig> may play a role in regulating these events.

the testis cell transplantation method has been developed as a powerful approach for studying spermatogenesis. it is also used to examine spermatogenic defects, to correct male infertility and to generate transgenic animals  <cit> . primary germ cells are the best model to perform these experiments, but there are some puzzles: 1) it is difficult to obtain enough spermatogonia cells from seminiferous tubules since these cells are a minority among germ cells. 2) the transfection efficiency of prnat-h <dig> /hygro-6# into spermatogonia is very low. 3) most of spermatogonia transfected by plasmids will undergo death. to resolve the above problems, we have established a method for studying mammalian spermatogenesis using a gc- <dig> spermatogonia line transplantation model. its distinct advantage is to make it much easier to obtain highly-purified gc- <dig> spermatogonia cells for experiments than by purifying primary spermatogonia cells from mouse seminiferous tubules.

the results of the current study show that transplanted control gc- <dig> cells can differentiate from spermatogonia into spermatids, indicating that they possess the properties of germ stem cells, capable of differentiating in an in vivo microenvironment. furthermore, the appearance of spermatids derived from control gc- <dig> cells and from the residual endogenous germ cells that had resisted busulfan treatment in the seminiferous tubules showed that these damaged tubules maintained the ability to generate spermatids from spermatogonia. thus, the disappearance of the mrhbdd <dig> knockdown gc- <dig> cells from the seminiferous tubules  <dig> weeks after transplantation is the direct result of endogenous mrhbdd <dig> suppression.

mrhbdd <dig> has anti-apoptotic potential, and its suppression in gc- <dig> cells vitiates spermatogonia survival and differentiation in vivo. the mrhbdd <dig> knockdown gc- <dig> cells did not disappear from the mouse seminiferous tubules because they entered a morbid state and died; they showed normal survival and differentiation in vitro like the negative control gc- <dig> cells. although the mechanism by which mrhbdd <dig> regulates mammalian spermatogenesis needs to be clarified, it seems quite logical that it occurs by regulating germ cell apoptosis, because mrhbdd <dig> knockdown gc- <dig> cells were more sensitive to apoptotic stimuli than negative control cells. an apparently indispensable role for mrhbdd <dig> during this process has been demonstrated by the present in vivo results. this warrants additional studies to determine whether malfunction of this enzyme may be a basis of male infertility. this information may be useful for the development of a male contraceptive.

CONCLUSIONS
the mrhbdd <dig> gene may be associated with the regulation of mammalian spermatogenesis by regulating apoptosis in spermatogonia.
