BACKGROUND
iris, a genus of 200â€“ <dig> species in the iridaceae , is one of the most widely admired and earliest cultivated garden flowers, having appeared in ancient eygptian artifacts as early as  <dig> b.c.  <cit> . the most widely cultivated, hybridized, and horticulturally important species are i.germanica , i.pseudacorus , and i.sibirica , each with numerous commercially important cultivars. iris species are found in diverse habitats on every continent in the northern hemisphere and have been important models for the study of plant evolution, ecology, and hybrid speciation  <cit> . chromosome numbers and ploidy are highly variable among and within species in the genus, ranging from 2n =  <dig> in i. attica to 2n =  <dig> in i. versicolor  <cit> . similarly, haploid genome lengths are generally large and highly variable in the genus, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mbp  <cit> .

minimal genomic resources have been developed for iris, a genus where forward genetic approaches have previously been applied to the study of life history and other traits by genotyping generic dna markers, e.g., random amplified polymorphic dna  or retrotransposon display  markers, in segregating populations developed from interspecific hybrids  <cit> . while such markers have facilitated linkage and quantitative trait locus  mapping in iris, the uncertain orthology of rapd and irre bands has precluded cross-referencing loci across populations and species. simple sequence repeat , restriction fragment length polymorphism , and single nucleotide polymorphism  markers are typically ortholog-specific and, consequently, have been widely used as dna landmarks for synteny analysis and cross-referencing loci across populations  <cit> . thus far, a limited number of ortholog-specific dna marker have been described for iris  <cit> . the primary goal of the present study was to develop a sufficient number of ortholog-specific dna markers for genome-wide comparative genetic mapping and other genotyping applications in i. brevicaulis , i. fulva , and other species in the genus by developing a small est database and targeting ssrs in ests.

ssrs are ubiquitous in transcribed sequences, typically locus-specific and co-dominant, and often multi-allelic, highly polymorphic, and transferrable among species within genera  <cit> . est databases have been a rich source of ssrs for the development of ortholog-specific est-ssr markers for genotyping applications in numerous species of flowering plants  <cit> . when our study was initiated, a limited number of ests  had been deposited in genbank  for a single species in the genus, i. hollandica  <cit> , and were insufficient for est-ssr marker development. we developed a small est database from cdna sequences produced from normalized cdna libraries of two species of louisiana iris , partly to support the development of several hundred est-ssr markers for comparative mapping and other genotyping applications in louisiana irises and partly to create dna sequence and ortholog-specific dna markers resources for the genus as a whole. previous forward genetic analyses in i. brevicaulis and i. fulva identified qtl for several morphological, life history, and ecological traits  <cit> . because ortholog-specific dna markers were previously lacking for these genera, linkage groups and qtl identified in earlier analyses could not be cross-referenced and comparative genetic mapping was infeasible. here, we describe the i. brevicaulis-i. fulva est database and the development, cross-species utility, and polymorphisms of i. brevicaulis-i. fulva est-ssr markers among wild collected ecotypes of four species of louisiana iris  and horticulturally important cultivars of tall-bearded , yellow-flag , and siberian  iris.

RESULTS
development of a leaf and root est database for iris
normalized leaf and root cdna libraries were developed from i.brevicaulis  and i.fulva  ecotypes . library quality was checked by sequencing colony-pcr amplified inserts from  <dig> randomly selected cdna clones split between the ib <dig> and if <dig> libraries. of the  <dig> clones,  <dig>  harbored inserts  <dig> bp or longer, three lacked inserts , and  <dig>  harbored unique inserts. subsequently,  <dig>  cdna clones were single-passed sequenced and yielded  <dig>  ests surpassing quality standards,  <dig>  from the ib <dig> and  <dig>  from the if <dig> library. less than 1% of the clones lacked cdna inserts . the vector- and quality-trimmed ests were deposited in genbank , annotated by blastx analyses against ncbi databases, assembled, and deposited in a database  developed by modifying a previously described est processing pipeline and database  <cit> . the mean length of vector- and quality-trimmed ests was  <dig>  bp.

cdna normalization minimized redundancy in the iris est database and yielded a wealth of unique cdna sequences  for est-ssr marker development and other applications in iris biology, breeding, and floriculture . the  <dig>  ests assembled into  <dig>  unigenes ; hence,  <dig> % of the ests were unique and  <dig> % of the unigenes were singletons. cdnas were normalized using a protocol which has been applied in numerous plant and animal species and minimized abundant transcript resequencing  <cit> . cdna populations in leaves are dominated by abundant transcripts, e.g., chlorophyl a/b binding proteins and rubisco, neither of which were abundant among transcripts isolated by sequencing normalized leaf cdna libraries. the deepest contigs contained seven ests.

unigenes ranged in length from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp with a mean length of  <dig>  bp. less than one-tenth of the unigenes  were sequenced through the polya tail. mean gc contents, which were identical for i.brevicaulis  and i.fulva , were slightly greater than mean gc contents reported for onion  and arabidopsis  transcripts  <cit> . unigenes were annotated by blastx  analyses against the ncbi non-redundant protein  and uniprotkb swiss-prot and trembl  databases. using a blastx threshold of <e =  <dig>  significant similarities were found and putative functions were identified for  <dig>  iris unigenes . thirty-two  additional unigenes were similar to genes of unknown function. significant similarities were not found for the other  <dig>  iris unigenes . the fraction of unigenes homologous to cdnas encoding known function genes was similar to onion, an economically important species in the asparagales  <cit> .

the louisiana iris ests developed in the present study have moderately increased dna sequence resources for iris, which were previously minimal , and supplied ests for an important basal species in the asparagales, a family where dna sequence information has primarily been produced for onion, asparagus , and model species  <cit> . van doorn et al.  <cit>  previously described  <dig> i. hollandica ests from a tepal cdna library. other than the latter,  <dig> nucleotide sequences for  <dig> species of iris had previously been deposited in public databases, the bulk of which were for a limited number of dna sequence motifs commonly targeted in phylogenetic analyses, e.g., matk. the sanger ests described here were produced before the emergence of next-generation dna sequencing technologies, which have dramatically increased dna sequencing throughput and are facilitating deeper and broader dna sequencing than was previously practical in species with limited dna sequence resources  <cit> . the sanger ests we produced, while limited in number, build the foundation for deeper transcriptome sequencing in iris using next-generation technologies.

abundance, characteristics, and distribution of ssrs in louisiana iris ests
ssrs were highly frequent in the louisiana iris est database . we identified  <dig>  perfect ssrs  in  <dig>  unigenes. one-fourth of the  <dig>  unigenes in the transcript assembly harbored at least one ssr, a frequency which was much greater than the frequency range  in many other flowering plants  <cit> . the mean ssr density was one per  <dig>  bp, which was much higher than the density found in onion , another species in the asparagales, and arabidopsis . when the transcript assembly was mined for perfect and imperfect repeats,  <dig>  ssrs  were identified in  <dig>  unigenes  with a mean density of approximately one ssr per  <dig> bp; imperfect repeats are interrupted short tandem repeats.

ssr repeat numbers ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> and lengths ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp . of the  <dig>  perfect ssrs,  <dig>   were  <dig> bp or longer and  <dig>  were  <dig> bp or longer. the mean repeat number was  <dig> and the mean repeat length was  <dig> bp. of the  <dig>  perfect repeats,  <dig> were dinucleotides  and  <dig> were trinucleotides . the most common repeat motifs were ag/ct , aag/ctt , and agg/cct  . slightly more than two-thirds of the ssrs were located in utrs . of repeats identified in utrs,  <dig> % were dinucleotides and  <dig> % were trinucleotides. conversely, of repeats identified in cdss,  <dig> % were dinucleotides and  <dig> % were trinucleotides . the low frequency of ssrs identified in 3'-utrs was primarily a function of 5'-end sequencing, which yielded significantly fewer 3' than 5'-utr sequences .

the most common dinucleotide repeat motif was ag/ct, which constituted  <dig> % of the dinucleotide repeats identifed in iris ests and has been the most common dinucleotide repeat identified in other plant est databases  <cit> . ag/ct repeats have been widely targeted for est-ssr marker development in plants because, in addition to being highly abundant, they are often highly polymorphic, more abundant in utrs than cdss, seldom associated with transposons, and consistently amplify and yield robust ssr markers  <cit> . the frequencies of trinucleotide repeats in cdss and dinucleotide repeats in utrs appear to be similar in wheat and iris .

trinucleotide repeats are typically more abundant than dinucleotide repeats in plants  <cit> ; however, dinucleotide repeats  were more abundant than trinucleotide repeats  in iris. trinucleotide repeats  have been more abundant than dinucleotide repeats  in analyses of est databases of several grass species  <cit> . of the est-ssrs identified in wheat , 70% were trinucleotides and 30% were dinucleotides  <cit> . aag/ctt and agg/cct  were the most abundant trinucleotide repeats in iris, whereas gcc/ggc appears to be the most abundant trinucleotide repeat motif in other plants  <cit> . ssrs were more abundant in utrs than cdss in iris, whereas they are more abundant in cdss than utrs in other plant species  <cit> . ssr abundance in 3'-utrs of iris ests may have been underestimated in the present study by 5' directional sequencing of cdnas, which artificially skews the distribution. ssrs appear to be equally abudant in 5'- and 3'-utrs in other plant species  <cit> . if this pattern holds in iris, the frequency of ssrs in utrs could be as great as 80%, which implies the frequency of ssrs in iris ests could be greater than reported here .

louisiana iris est-ssr marker development, screening, allele length polymorphisms, and cross-species utility
ssrs with n â‰¥  <dig> repeats were selected from  <dig> unigenes for primer design and marker development . the ssr markers were initially screened for amplication and allele length polymorphisms among three lousiana iris ecotypes . of the  <dig> est-ssr markers,  <dig>  amplified alleles from at least one genotype , whereas  <dig>  either failed to amplify alleles or produced amplicons which were too long  or complex for genotyping. of the  <dig> est-ssr markers,  <dig> spanned introns longer than  <dig> bp and amplified alleles longer than  <dig> bp and could not be genotyped . of the  <dig> ssr markers found to amplify alleles within the prescribed genotyping length range ,  <dig>  were polymorphic among ib <dig>  ib <dig>  and if <dig>  the number of polymorphic ssr markers/cross ranged from  <dig>  for ib <dig> Ã— ib <dig> to  <dig>  for ib <dig> Ã— if <dig> . hence, most of the est-ssr markers were polymorphic in i.brevicaulis Ã— i.fulva mapping populations.

forty i.brevicaulis-i.fulva est-ssr markers were selected for more in-depth screening and analysis, primarily to quantify polymorphisms and assess transferability and utility among a broader sample of ecotypes, cultivars, and species. the  <dig> est-ssr markers, which have been genetically mapped in i.brevicaulis Ã— i.fulva and are distributed across the genome , were screened for amplification and allele length polymorphisms among  <dig> wild collected ecotypes of four lousiana iris species  and  <dig> cultivars of tall-bearded , yellow-flag , and siberian  iris . whilst 100% of the est-ssr markers amplified alleles from louisiana iris ecotypes, half or slightly less than half amplified alleles from yellow-flag , siberian , and tall-bearded  iris cultivars. of the  <dig> est-ssr markers, only nine amplified alleles across the  <dig> ecotypes and cultivars . one to three alleles/marker were amplified from triploid i.germanica, whereas one to two alleles/marker were amplified from the diploid species . the nine est-ssr markers were highly polymorphic among tall-bearded, yellow-flag, and siberian iris cultivars; heterozygosities ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . even though i. pseudacorus and i. sibirica belong to the same section  as louisiana iris  <cit> , a significant decrease in allele amplification was observed in these species, and was comparable to the decrease observed in i. germanica, a species from section iris. nevertheless, many of the i.brevicaulis-i.fulva est-ssr markers developed in the present study amplify alleles from other species and should have broad utility in the genus  <cit> .

ssr
the  <dig> est-ssr markers were highly polymorphic among and consistently amplified alleles from louisiana iris ecotypes; the null allele frequency was  <dig> % . the number of alleles/locus  ranged from two to  <dig>  the mean number of alleles/locus  was  <dig> , heterozygosities of individual ssr markers ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and the mean heterozygosity  was  <dig> . eighty to 100% of the est-ssr markers were polymorphic, n ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and h ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  among louisiana iris ecotypes . the number of species-specific alleles ranged from  <dig> in i. nelsonii to  <dig> in i. brevicaulis. dinucleotide repeats were slightly more polymorphic than trinucleotide repeats. the mean number of alleles was n =  <dig>  for dinucleotide and  <dig>  for trinucleotide repeats and the mean heterozygosity was h =  <dig>  for dinucleotide and  <dig>  for trinucleotide repeats. ssrs in coding sequences  were only slightly less polymorphic than ssrs in utrs  .

genetic diversity among wild collected ecotypes and horticulturally important cultivars
because only nine of the  <dig> i. brevicaulis-i.fulva est-ssr markers amplified alleles from horticultural cultivars of i.germanica, i.pseudacorus, and i.sibirica, genetic distances and dendrograms were separately estimated from genotypes of the nine est-ssr markers among accessions of all seven species and of the  <dig> est-ssr markers among ecotypes of the four louisiana iris species . genetic distances  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  among louisiana iris ecotypes. the longest genetic distances were interspecific , whilst the shortest genetic distances were intraspecific . ecotypes assembled into species-specific clusters which were separated by greater genetic distances than ecotypes within species-specific clusters . genetic diversity was significant and diffuse among ecotypes or cultivars within species. only a few est-ssr markers were needed to identify  ecotypes and cultivars.

CONCLUSIONS
cdna sequences, an est database, and est-ssr markers were developed for comparative mapping, forward genetics, and other genotyping applications in iris. cdna normalization minimized transcript redundancy and small scale est sequencing  yielded  <dig>  unigenes for gene discovery and dna marker development. perfect ssrs were identified in one-fourth of the unigenes  and est-ssr markers were developed for nearly half of the latter . three-fourths of the primers designed and tested  amplified alleles from reference ecotypes of i. brevicaulis and i. fulva and yielded robust est-ssr markers. when  <dig> of the est-ssr markers were screened for amplification, genotyping utility, and polymorphisms across species, 100% amplified alleles from i. brevicaulis, i. fulva, i. hexagona, and i. nelsonii ecotypes, whereas 42â€“50% amplified alleles from i.germanica, i.pseudacorus, and i.sibirica ecotypes and cultivars. hence, a large percentage of the i. brevicaulis-i. fulva est-ssr markers developed in the present study should amplify alleles from other species and have broad utility in the genus. finally, significant allelic diversity was discovered among louisiana, yellow-flag, siberian, and tall-bearded ecotypes and cultivars; 90% of the est-ssr markers were polymorphic and supply a wealth of ortholog-specific dna markers for biological and horticultural research in iris.
