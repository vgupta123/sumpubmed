BACKGROUND
recently observed structural relationships between the architectures of viruses infecting hosts from the three domains of life  <cit>  poured fuel onto the discussion of the origin and evolution of viruses  <cit> . it is now evident that viruses are ancient and that very diverse virus families may have arisen from a relatively small number of primordial viral ancestors. we have suggested previously that a limited number of features represent the essence of a virus and that viruses sharing such characteristics can be joined into lineages. those features are responsible for the formation of a functional virion and are referred here as the viral "self" . on the other hand, components encoded in viral genome and needed for interaction with the host are assumed to be nonessential for the virion formation and thus represent the "nonself" category, although they are indispensable for viral genome replication and the interaction of the virus with its host.

ascribing viral properties to "self" or "nonself" categories for highly divergent viruses, which nonetheless, belong to the same viral lineage  <cit> , is based on structural and functional relationships. however, these relationships often cannot be revealed using sequence analysis due to the lack of detectable similarity. components of the viral "self" in more closely related viruses are expected to be conserved also at the sequence level. the first direct support for the presence of the "self" elements was obtained when genomes of six tectiviruses were compared  <cit> . the analysed viruses were highly similar , but there were clear differences in the number of altered nucleotides between the genes. genes for structural elements and those for genome packaging were the most conserved, whereas the virus entry and release-related genes were the least conserved ones  <cit> .

bacteriophage pm <dig>  the only known member of the corticoviridae virus family  <cit> , is a tailless marine bacteriophage that was isolated from the coastal seawater in chile  <cit> . there are so far only two closely related pseudoalteromonas species, pseudoalteromonas espejiana bal- <dig> and pseudoalteromonas sp. er72m <dig>  which pm <dig> was shown to infect  <cit> . the pm <dig> virion consists of an icosahedrally organized proteinaceous capsid surrounding a protein-rich lipid membrane, which encloses a highly supercoiled circular double-stranded dna  genome  <cit> . replication of the viral genome takes place near the cytoplasmic membrane via a rolling-circle mechanism initiated by the phage-encoded replication initiation protein p <dig>  <cit> . the  <dig>  <dig> bp-long pm <dig> genome is organised into three operons – two early and one late  <cit> . the two early operons are transcribed in opposite directions. the leftwards-transcribing early operon encodes transcriptional repressors , while the rightwards-transcribing early operon codes for protein required for genome replication, transcription activators of the late operon , as well as one structural protein, the packaging atpase p <dig>  the rest of the structural protein-coding genes  as well as genes  encoding proteins involved in the cell lysis are located in the late rightwards-transcribing operon and are tightly packed. pm <dig> is a virulent phage and has not been shown to lysogenize its host cells.

in this study we identified thirteen pm2-like elements residing in the genomes of eleven aquatic proteobacteria. comparative analysis of gene composition between the identified putative prophages and bacteriophage pm <dig> let us to test and support the viral "self" hypothesis. furthermore, our results show that pm2-like elements are abundant in the genomes of aquatic bacteria and therefore the role of tailless bacteriophages on aquatic microorganisms might be underestimated.

RESULTS
putative corticoviral prophages were identified by homology-based searches against the nonredundant protein database at ncbi. for our search, we selected gene encoding the canonical viral "self" element, the major coat protein  p <dig>  <cit> . in all of these cases, genes for the packaging atpase p <dig>  <cit>  homologues were observed in the proximity of the p2-encoding genes. it should be noted that this approach enables detection of only close phage relatives that have not yet diverged to a point where homologous sequences are no longer recognizable  <cit> . thirteen homologues of p2-encoding genes were identified in eleven bacterial genomes. pm <dig> genome is  <dig>  <dig> bp-long, therefore an approximately  <dig> kb-long region surrounding the p2/p9-encoding pair of genes was further examined for the presence of other putative pm2-related genes.

when protein sequences homologous to the mcp of bacteriophage pm <dig> were assayed for structure prediction, they all matched, as the first hit, to the mcp of the paramecium bursaria chlorella virus  <dig>   <cit> , although the scores were low . interestingly, validation for this observation was obtained from the ongoing structural characterization of the mcp p <dig> of phage pm <dig>  <cit> . our preliminary results indicate that p <dig> has the same topology as the other members of the prd1-adeno viral lineage , which among others also includes pbcv- <dig>  <cit> .

analysis of the corticoviral elements
four functionally distinct groups of genes constitute the pm <dig> genome. these are genes encoding proteins responsible for genome replication , transcription regulation , structural components of the virion , and proteins involved in cell lysis . the core viral "self" determinants, genes ii  and ix , are separated by the late promoter region and a short gene vii coding for structural protein p <dig>  an open reading frame  corresponding to gene vii as well as an intergenic region matching the pm <dig> late promoter  were also recognized in all thirteen putative prophages. the region coding for gene ii/ix homologs was always found as a block, exactly as in the pm <dig> genome, except in photobacterium profundum species ss <dig> and 3tck, where the putative prophages contained an additional orf . genes coding for structural proteins p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> were found in 54%, 62%, and 77% of putative corticoviral elements, respectively . notably, vibrio parahaemolyticus rimd <dig> contained two copies of the pm2-like element, one in each of its two chromosomes, while methylobacillus flagellatus kt had two absolutely identical  elements in its single chromosome.

as mentioned above, the pm <dig> genome is organised into three operons – two early and one late  <cit> . the maintenance region of pseudoalteromonas plasmid pas <dig>  <cit>  was shown to share similar genomic organisation with the two early transcriptional units of pm <dig>  <cit> . significant sequence similarity was found only between the leftwards-transcribing operons and the promoter regions . replication protein coding genes of the pas <dig> plasmid  and phage pm <dig>  did not share any sequence similarity, although they were located at the equivalent positions . in light of those observations, it was proposed that the entire leftwards-transcribing early operon together with the promoter region was obtained from the pseudoalteromonas plasmid pas <dig> via horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . both genes, xv and xvi, were detected in putative prophages of vibrio parahaemolyticus, vibrio vulnificus cmcp <dig>  and photobacterium profundum ss <dig>  where they were flanking the rest of the viral genes. the remaining corticoviral elements  contained either gene xv or xvi. interestingly, it seems that in all cases the presumably circular genomes of the corticoviral elements were linearized between the gene xv and xvi. gene xv was shown to be dispensable in laboratory conditions  <cit> , however, its presence in the genomes of the putative prophages suggests that it might play a beneficial role for the phage in the natural environment.

surprisingly, gene xii-type replication initiation protein genes were identified only in six of the eleven bacterial species , and orf 1-type  replication protein genes were identified in three of the corticoviral elements . putative prophage of vibrio sp. med <dig> encoded an orf, the product of which shared sequence similarity  with a unique replication protein repa  from pseudomonas alcaligenes plasmid pra <dig>   <cit> . furthermore, an identical possible dnaa protein binding site, 5'-ttatccaca-3', essential for pra <dig> plasmid replication, was also found in the putative prophage sequence at the equivalent position, downstream of the repa gene. no putative replication protein-coding genes were identified in the ralstonia eutropha h <dig> corticoviral element. however, we identified an orf coding for a potential dna binding protein containing the so-called at-hook motif  <cit> . the at-hook motif has been shown to be required for the replication and partitioning of epstein-barr virus orip plasmids  <cit> , as well as for the origin recognition complex binding to the replication origin in fission yeast  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the at-hook protein might be involved in the replication of the corticoviral element in ralstonia eutropha h <dig>  thus comprising the forth replication system  found in pm2-like elements. furthermore, the at-hook motif-containing protein in ralstonia eutropha h <dig> shares sequence similarity with at-hook motif proteins from ralstonia pickettii filamentous bacteriophage p12j  and ralstonia solanacearum plasmid pjtps <dig> , suggesting possible genetic exchanges between those three ralstonia elements. vibrio vulnificus cmcp <dig> has two chromosomes. the putative corticoviral prophage was found on chromosome  <dig> only. this prophage has the orf 1-type replication protein-coding gene. on the other hand, chromosome  <dig> contains a gene, encoding a putative homolog of the replication initiation protein p <dig> , but no other pm2-related genes. it is possible that a genetic exchange event between the two chromosomes of vibrio vulnificus cmcp <dig> gave rise to viruses with the gene xii-type replication initiation protein-coding genes.

we have previously noticed that in the same viral lineage  replication systems do not need to be related, i.e. the "self" and the replication systems are uncoupled. the final replication product just has to be specifically recognized for genome packaging  <cit> . this observation is supported here by the finding that putative pm2-like prophages encode several types of replication systems. consequently, genes for genome replication cannot be considered as being part of the viral "self" category, although such genes are among the most conserved ones in viral genomes. this is also true for the tailed dsdna bacteriophages . it has been observed that members of the podoviridae family use two different strategies to replicate their genomes  <cit> . t7-like phages replicate their genomes by a primase/dna polymerase mechanism, while φ29-like podoviruses use a covalently linked 5' terminal protein primer  <cit> . both, t <dig> and φ <dig>  have the canonical hk <dig> mcp fold  <cit> . interestingly, icosahedral tailless lipid-containing phage prd <dig>  a type member of the tectiviridae family, also uses the latter strategy to replicate its linear dsdna genome  <cit> , but has a completely different mcp topology  <cit> .

in order to escape from the infected cell, bacteriophages have to overcome the cell envelope barrier. all dsdna bacteriophages characterized so far use the holin-endolysin system to accomplish this step  <cit> . holins are small phage-encoded membrane proteins that, in a precisely scheduled manner, form nonspecific lesions in the plasma membrane of the infected cell. endolysins are phage-encoded peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes that may possess endo-β-n-acetylglucosaminidase, n-acetylmuramidase, n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, and/or endopeptidase activities. the endolysins are translocated to the periplasmic space or are activated with the aid of holin proteins. however, no putative endolysins were recognized in the pm <dig> proteome. instead, we identified genes  that encode novel lysis-associated proteins p <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> . we also discovered that p <dig> homologues are encoded in the genomes of several enteric  and marine  tailed bacteriophages  <cit> . this illustrates that lysis genes may be exchanged between bacteriophages belonging to different lineages. only the putative prophage of vibrio vulnificus cmcp <dig> contained a homolog of pm <dig> gene xvii , while no homologues of gene xviii could be identified. interestingly, putative endolysin genes, similar to those of other dsdna bacteriophages, were found in corticoviral elements of vibrio splendidus 12b <dig> and vibrionales bacterium swat- <dig> , methylobacillus flagellatus kt , methylibium petroleiphilum pm <dig> , and ralstonia eutropha h <dig>  . lysis genes have not been shown to participate in virion assembly, e.g. interfere with the "self" function. as shown here, the same family of viruses may have a very different set of genes responsible for progeny release. consequently, similarly to the replication systems, the lysis-related genes belong to the viral "nonself" category.

in order to establish a stable relationship with the host organism, temperate phages replicate in synchrony with the bacterial chromosome. one mechanism to do so is to integrate the phage genome as part of the host chromosome. this event is catalysed by recombinases  that are often found adjacent to the integration site of the phage genome, thus marking one of the prophage ends  <cit> . however, not all temperate phages encode recombinases. for example, filamentous vibriophage ctxφ exploits host-encoded recombinases xerc/d to integrate its genome into the bacterial chromosome  <cit> . we identified putative integrases in corticoviral elements of vibrio splendidus 12b <dig> , vibrionales bacterium swat- <dig> , and oceanobacter sp. red <dig> . while putative prophages of vibrio sp. med <dig> and photobacterium profundum ss <dig> contained fragments of putative transposase-coding genes . in addition to an integrase, putative prophages of vibrio splendidus 12b <dig> and vibrionales bacterium swat- <dig> encoded a ci/cro-type repressor  <cit> , similar to that of a λ-like bacteriophage dms <dig> . we do not currently know whether any of the pm2-like elements is inducible. however, the presence of recombinase-coding genes points to the mobile character of these elements and suggests that at least some of them are functional prophages.

ecological considerations
in order to determine in what ecological niches the putative pm2-like prophages could be traced, we checked the origins of the eleven bacteria harboring the corticoviral elements. all of them turned out to be residents of the aquatic ecosystem and were classified into the phylum proteobacteria in the ncbi taxonomy database  <cit> .

marine bacteriophages are the most abundant biological entities in the oceans. since the oceans are the world's largest biosphere, marine phages are probably the most abundant biological entities on earth, playing a vital role in the carbon cycling through marine food webs, gene transfer, and conversion of hosts by lysogeny . over  <dig> bacterial viruses have been examined in the electron microscope from  <dig> to  <dig>  of these, about  <dig> phages  were tailed  and only  <dig> phages  were cubic, filamentous, or pleomorphic  <cit> . tailed phage genomes were also observed to be in great abundance maintained inside the cell, constituting as much as  <dig> – 20% of some bacterial genomes .

in order to compare the relative abundance of pm2-like elements maintained within aquatic bacteria with that of the tailed bacteriophages,  <dig> genomes of aquatic bacteria available in genbank  were searched for the presence of putative prophages of tailed viruses. for results to be comparable, the same identification approach as used here for the corticoviral elements was applied. we used the viral "self" determinants of the tailed phages , i.e. mcp and the larger subunit of the terminase protein, although other virion proteins were suggested to suite better for prophage detection  <cit> . if the bacterial genomes contained genes coding for both selected proteins, we assumed that a prophage is present on the chromosome . as the tailed phages are not the object of this manuscript, no further detailed analysis was carried out. however, using this approach the abundance of the putative "tailed" prophages represents the maximal chance to be detected. the highest number of matches, twenty-two, was obtained with mcp and terminase protein sequences of enterophage p <dig>  among marine tailed phages analysed, the most abundant seems to be bacteriophage vhml-type, with close relatives identified in ten bacterial species. enteric siphovirus λ and marine podovirus vp16c each had three relatives among  <dig> aquatic bacterial genomes analysed. only one of these bacterial species  contained both, the "self" determinants of the tailed phage and the putative pm2-like prophage . notably, the two most abundant tailed phages, p <dig> and vhml, are temperate. therefore, it seems that their abundance in the genomes of aquatic bacteria reflects the lifestyle they utilize. interestingly, pm <dig> and vhml had almost the same number of matches  . however, it should be noted that pm <dig> is a strictly lytic phage, which has never been shown to enter the lysogenic pathway. there are no grounds to believe that integration frequency of lytic pm2-like phages should differ from that of the lytic tailed phages. furthermore, we assume that the quantity of prophage-like elements is related to the quantity of free-living viruses.

a – letter in the parenthesis denotes whether bacteriophage is lytic , temperate  or pseudo-temperate .

b – vhml putative coat protein contains abundant peptidase domain   <cit> .

therefore, only homologs for which global sequence alignments with the major coat protein were possible were further analyzed.

pm <dig> is the only icoshedral tailless marine bacteriophage characterized in detail. however, a number of transmission electron microscopy  studies have showed that tailless or short-tailed phages are the predominant morphotype in marine samples  <cit> . since 96% of phages were proposed to be tailed  <cit> , this observation was explained as a result of the dissociation of tails from the capsids during the sample preparation for tem  <cit> . our data presented here suggests that the abundance of pm2-like viruses versus tailed phages in the aquatic ecosystem  might be vastly underestimated . this is also supported by the recent sampling of bacteriophages in alkaline hot springs at different geographical locations. out of one-hundred-fifteen bacteriophage strains isolated during a trial, 50% were icosahedral tailless dsdna phages, while tailed ones constituted only 44% of isolates  <cit> , suggesting that tailed phages might not be dominant species in all ecological niches. on the other hand, the recent metagenomic study on free-living marine viruses suggested that the most dominant phages are those related to tailed cyanophage p-ssm <dig>  <cit> . however, the abundance of p-ssm2-like phages is questionable as more than 91% of the metagenomic sequences were not significantly similar to any of those in the database  <cit> , therefore leaving space for alternative interpretations when more virus sequence data will be available. interestingly, the same metagenomic study revealed the previously overlooked high abundance of small icosahedral tailless ssdna phages  in the samples obtained from the sargasso sea  <cit> . it is clear that the relative abundances of any type of viruses cannot be accurately accessed until much more data is available. it is also obviously that phage ecology is only gradually releasing its secrets and further surprises are anticipated.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge this is the first study showing that elements related to tailless dsdna bacteriophages can be identified in bacterial genomes. the comparative analysis of the newly identified thirteen putative pm2-like elements, allowed us to test the innate viral "self" hypothesis  <cit> . we show here that the previously proposed most conserved viral "self" determinants, the major coat protein and the packaging atpase, were the only proteins that could be found in all detected corticoviral elements. we also argue here that the genes needed for viral genome replication, as well as for host cell lysis, belong to the "nonself" category of genes, and can be acquired via horizontal gene exchange as needed. therefore, proteins of the "nonself" category should not be used for the phylogenetic comparisons of different bacteriophages. in general, we believe that all viral proteins that are in one way or another involved in the viral interaction with its host belong to the "nonself" category. furthermore, we challenge here the common knowledge that the vast majority of bacteriophages in aquatic environments belong to the order caudovirales . we suggest that abundance of pm2-like viruses in the aquatic environment as well as their importance in the ecology of aquatic microorganisms might be well underestimated.
