BACKGROUND
the molecular mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphism have only been partially elucidated. gene expression analysis has been utilized to answer relevant questions through analysis of transcriptomic differences. while many of these studies have been performed on data from humans, rodents, and fruit flies, only a few studies have attempted to characterize sexual dimorphism in cattle  <cit> . additionally, most bovine transcriptomic research with the goal of identifying mechanisms of sexual dimorphism related to tissue growth and development has been performed exclusively on pre-implantation embryos; exploratory analyses on other tissues may provide further insight into these mechanisms.

bovine beef and milk are important sources of nutrition for humans  <cit> . the quality and quantity of these nutrition sources have been shown to be affected by sex and the expression of sex determination genes in the food-producing animal  <cit> . investigation of sexual dimorphism in metabolic tissues such as liver, muscle and adipose tissue from cattle is crucial for both research and the food production industry. results of previous microarray studies which investigated sex differences in metabolic tissues and brain in mouse revealed that biological pathways are highly distinct between males and females. additionally, comparison of sex in multiple tissues revealed a tissue-specific pattern of gene expression  <cit> . given these results, we expect to find clear sexual differences in cattle metabolism as well.

while the entire brain displays sexually dimorphic phenotypes, the hypothalamus-pituitary axis acts as one of the primary structures which controls sexual dimorphism in the central nervous system  as well as peripheral tissues. the pituitary gland, known as the “master gland” of the body, acts as the central endocrine regulator of metabolism, growth, and sexual maturation. in order to perform these functions, unique cell types in the anterior pituitary gland secrete polypeptide hormones such as growth hormone  and gonadotropins, a family of protein hormones including luteinizing  and follicle stimulating  hormones, by appropriately orchestrating signals from environmental and internal stimuli. additionally, profound sex differences exist in hormonal regulation and responses of the pituitary gland to external stressors, which is why females display a higher vulnerability to various neuropsychiatric disorders  <cit> . hence, examination of sexually dimorphic gene expression patterns in the pituitary gland simultaneously with metabolic tissues will improve our understanding of sexual dimorphism in physiological and metabolic perspectives  <cit> . additionally, there is a lack of a species-specific research using transcriptome analysis on bovine pituitary-gland tissues to explore sexual dimorphism.

in recent years, the experimental design of transcriptomic studies to detect differentially expressed genes  has become increasingly more sophisticated in terms of considering multiple factors, which is often required for simultaneous investigation of multiple tissues samples. while most microarray studies employ a two-way analysis of variance   <cit>  for detecting degs from multifactor designed data, only a few rna-seq based transcriptome analysis studies continue to be performed using a multi-factorial design. there are two reasons why limited rna-seq studies with complex experimental designs are performed. firstly, high rna-seq prices make biological replication difficult. secondly, there is an absence of analysis methods for detection of degs in multi-factorial designed rna-seq data. while complex-structured rna-seq data can be analysed using r or sas, such approaches are often inadequate for handling normalization, assumption of distribution, etc. fortunately, recent methodological advances  <cit>  have made it possible to perform multi-factorial analysis on rna-seq data by using an analysis of deviance  model.

in the present study, we aimed to identify sexual dimorphic genes that contribute to bovine sexual dimorphism. two statistical approaches were utilized for analyzing complex rna-seq data from samples collected from several different tissues- liver, muscle, visceral adipose tissue and pituitary gland: 1) a simple two group comparison for detecting sexually dimorphic genes in each tissue ; and 2) an anodev based approach which simultaneously considers not only the effect of sex but also tissue type on the model . here we report advantages and disadvantages of these approaches for identification of sexually dimorphic genes in several tissues, as well as identified diverse mechanisms of bovine sexual dimorphism.

RESULTS
description of the rna-seq analysis pipeline
for extraction of rna-seq gene expression data, we employed trimmomatic  <cit> . as shown in , this resulted in clean reads  with a  <dig>  % average surviving reads rate among  <dig> samples. these reads were aligned to the cattle reference genome  using bowtie <dig> with default options with an average  <dig>  % mapping rate. we calculated gene expression using general transfer format  file from ucsc genome browser with mapped result on htseq python package.  <dig>  total genes resulted from this pipeline and detailed numbers of genes in each chromosome is reported in . non-expressed genes across all samples were removed. a total of  <dig>  genes were used for deg analysis.

identification of sexual dimorphic genes using m <dig> in each tissue
for identification of sexual dimorphic genes in several tissues, we performed a two-group test on each tissue using m <dig>  as a result,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes were detected as significantly differentially expressed in liver, fat, muscle, and pituitary-gland tissues, respectively . three genes were commonly identified in all four tissues: ddx3y, usp9y, and zfy ). significantly detected degs reveal high tissue-specificity; only a few degs were found commonly significant in several tissues simultaneously. of the  <dig> significantly detected degs in liver tissue,  <dig> genes were only identified in liver tissue, including cux <dig> , cyp7a <dig> , ak <dig> , col27a <dig> , and tnc . this pattern of strong tissue-specificity in detected degs was also observed in other tissues. in fat tissue,  <dig> out of  <dig> total degs were identified as fat-tissue specific sexually dimorphic gene, including igfbp <dig> , tectb , and acr . in muscle tissue, the highest number of sexual differenced genes was detected. while  <dig> genes were significantly detected, only  <dig> degs were commonly identified in other tissue. myh <dig> , mmp <dig> , mchr <dig> , and sh3kbp <dig>  were found to be extremely significant between female and male exclusively in muscle tissue. finally, of  <dig> degs detected as significant in pituitary-gland tissue,  <dig> of those were tissue specific including grp , loc <dig> , and lysb . for more detailed investigation of tissue specificity, we performed hierarchical clustering in order to uncover the relationship among tissues using all genes. figure 1- shows male and female samples clustered within each tissue; results reveal that expression differences between sexes are less than the differences across tissues. in this figure, within group similarity of fat tissue samples is observed to be lower than the others. however, this phenomenon can not only be observed at a certain fdr cut-off; tissue-specificities were also calculated by adjusting fdr-adjusted p-value cutoff  <dig>  to  <dig>  as shown in fig. 1-. although this significance cutoff was varied , overall trends were maintained in terms of ranking of tissue specificity.fig.  <dig> tissue specificity of the detected sex-related genes. a venn diagram of degs list using a two-group test in each tissue . b result of hierarchical clustering among each tissue samples using the all genes with pearson correlation coefficients. c number of detected genes and tissue specific genes by fdr cutoff and their tissue specificity calculation



characterizing sexual dimorphic genes in relation to sex biasness, chromosomal location, and tissues
a previous sexual dimorphism study in mouse  <cit>  defined over-expressed genes as sex-biased genes. following this definition, sex biasness was investigated in our study in order to identify bovine sexual characteristics. firstly, sexually dimorphic genes in each tissue detected using m <dig> were distinguished using both sex-biased information and chromosomal location such as autosome , unknown, x, and y chromosome which is based on gene annotation ). this figure reveals two primary differences among tissues in terms of proportion with significance level . first, all y-chromosomal sexually dimorphic genes were observed to be male-biased. second, no male-biased genes located in the x-chromosome were observed.fig.  <dig> distinguishing significant sexual dimorphic genes  from several categories including sex biasness, tissues, and chromosomal location. a the box plot composed of two factors, sex biasness and chromosomal allocation, in each tissue b the pie charts showed proportion of male and female biased genes in each tissue, respectively c manhattan plot for allocating sexual dimorphic genes from located chromosomal position with y-axis is a logged <dig> fold-changes . a total of  <dig> significantly detected degs using m <dig> across whole tissues were visualized. the red-dotted line represents the 2-fold change cutoff.



figure 2- shows significantly detected genes classified according to the proportion of sex biasness of each tissue. high female biasness was observed in liver , fat , and muscle tissues . on the other hand, a different pattern was observed in the pituitary-gland; the percentage of female biased genes in this tissue was lower than that of male biased genes . as this result could be only observed at a specific threshold value, we attempted to observe expression patterns by varying the fdr cutoff  . although the proportion of female biased genes was higher than that of male biased genes with fdr adjusted p-value <  <dig>  or < <dig>  in pituitary-gland tissue, the relatively high proportion of the male biased genes is preserved when comparing to other tissues. based on this observation, statistical tests were performed in order to examine this pattern of detected sexually dimorphic genes being enriched as male-biased genes in the pituitary-gland tissue more than in other tissues . results revealed that only detected degs  in pituitary-gland tissues were significantly male-biased.

significantly detected sexually dimorphic genes were visualized as a transcriptional manhattan plot )  <cit> . from this type of plot, comprehensive patterns can be panoptically recognized using detected genes in each tissue with their chromosomal information and log <dig> fold change  between female and male expression. to visualize an rna-seq version of manhattan plot, we used gene location information from the transcriptome reference file. unlike snp markers, genes are not specific to one base position, so we considered the central position of the gene region as that gene’s chromosomal location in order to apply rna-seq data. detected sexually dimorphic genes were shown to spread all over the chromosome , however, extremely strong signals were identified in the sex chromosome . these figures reveal that although sexual dimorphic genes are spread all over the chromosome, extremely large differenced genes based on the logfc can be identified in sex chromosome.

identification of sexual dimorphic genes considering the effect of whole tissue simultaneously using a statistical model based approach
in order to simultaneously consider the effect of tissue on the statistical model and identify sexually dimorphic genes, anodev implemented within edger  <cit>  was used to allow for identification of degs in cases where the data structure is more complex. m <dig> was used for detection of sexual dimorphic genes when adjusting for the effect of tissue on the model. as a result,  <dig> significant  degs were identified using a likelihood ratio test  including y-linked genes such as usp9y , ddx3y , and zfy , x-linked genes such as xist , kdm6a , and autosomal genes such as loc <dig> , lysb , and etc. which appeared on the list of the top  <dig> most significant genes . we compared the number of significant genes using a venn diagram, varying fdr-adjusted p-value cutoffs such as  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  . a larger number of sexually dimorphic genes were identified using m <dig> than using m <dig>  in addition, approximately half of the significantly detected degs resulting from using m <dig> were shown to overlap with the integrated model ; the proportion of overlapped genes was 40 ~ 92 % . however, there were a large number of non-overlapped genes which were only significantly detected when using either m <dig> or m <dig>  we examined potential factors causing this clear distinction between m <dig> and m <dig>  under a fdr adjusted p-value cutoff of  <dig> ,  <dig> genes were significantly detected using m <dig> and m <dig> . of these genes, three representative genes which showed distinctly different patterns between m <dig> and m <dig> were visualized as a box-plot  and a line-plot . it can be observed in these figures that significantly detected degs from m <dig> show relatively similar slopes among the tissues compared to significantly identified genes from m <dig>  as shown in figure s6-, ak <dig>  anxa <dig>  and stra <dig> were selected as representative genes for m <dig>  ak <dig>  was significantly detected in m <dig>  but was not significantly detected in m <dig> . likewise, anxa <dig> and stra <dig> genes were significant in m <dig>  in muscle and pituitary-gland, respectively. however, m <dig> reported fdr adjusted p-values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for muscle and pituitary-gland respectively. contrastively, agphd <dig>  kdm6a, and srsf <dig> genes were only significant using m <dig> . m <dig> did not significantly detect any of these genes in any tissue.

chromosomal enrichment analysis using significant sexual dimorphic genes from m2
sexually dimorphic genes are well known to not only be widespread across chromosomes, but also show high enrichment in the sex chromosome across diverse species  <cit> . based on the  <dig> degs significantly detected using m <dig>  chromosomal enrichment analysis was conducted in order to check the degree of chromosomal enrichment. to investigate the degree of enrichment in each chromosome of cattle species, a fisher’s exact test was employed using the degs identified using m <dig>  chromosome  <dig>   <dig>  x, and y were shown to be significantly  enriched . as expected given results of previous studies, sexual dimorphic genes were highly enriched in the x and y chromosome in cattle . this result implies that sexual dimorphic genes cover not only sex chromosome but autosome as well. additionally, creation of a manhattan plot revealed that m <dig> detected a larger number of degs than m <dig>  based on the detected  <dig> genes in m <dig>  sex biasness was calculated using chromosomal information ). a high percentage of the detected genes were observed as female biased gene, except for those found in the y chromosome. understandably, detected sexual dimorphic genes located in sex chromosomes showed specific sex biased expression without any exception. in the autosome and unknown chromosome , although a few male biased genes were observed, most detected genes were female biased genes. as shown in fig. 3-, sexually dimorphic genes of autosome and unknown chromosome were identified in both sex biased categories. in contrast, x and y linked genes were only identified in female and male biased categories, respectively. in this figure, it can be observed that this pattern is very similar with muscle tissue results using m <dig> ). in order to confirm this result, log fold-changes were visualized as a logfc based manhattan plot ) for the significantly observed  <dig> detected genes. additionally, their fdr adjusted p-values of m <dig> were visualized as adensity plot . these plots reveal that a larger number of degs were observed in muscle tissue than in others, and most degs showed female-biased expression.table  <dig> results of chromosomal enrichment test

gene-set enrichment analysis for identification of biological mechanism about sexual dimorphism using significant genes from m2
in order to better understand the biological processes related to sexual dimorphism, enrichment analysis was performed on the  <dig> degs detected using m <dig>  david analysis revealed  <dig> significantly enriched go biological process terms  and  <dig> kegg pathways . results of enrichment analysis revealed many different biological processes, presumably involved in cattle sexual dimorphism. several immune system related terms were found enriched: immune system development , autoimmune thyroid disease , t cell receptor signaling pathway , and natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity . additionally, several metabolic pathways between sexes such as regulation of rna metabolic process , fructose and mannose metabolism , glycosphingolipid biosynthesis  and steroid hormone biosynthesis  were significantly identified. finally, calcium signaling pathway , eye development  and taste transduction  were found to be enriched as well. in order to segregate these diverse significant gene-sets, david annotation clustering was performed and  <dig> enriched biological clusters exhibiting diverse biological activities were identified . among them, one cluster containing several sex related terms was observed, which included rhythmic process  and circadian rhythm . in order to visually represent this relationship, a hierarchical relationship plot of go terms was constructed . this plot revealed that results appear to be nested underneath two representative groups: sex differentiation related and rhythmic process related terms. several degs were associated with these terms, including afp, cga, foxl <dig>  stat5a and ang <dig>  five significant transcription factors were found to be associated with circadian rhythm: per <dig>  nr1d <dig>  dbp, nfil <dig> and bhlhe <dig>  they are known to participate in core transcriptional regulation of circadian rhythm and, according to our results, they may have roles linking circadian rhythm and/or metabolism in sexual dimorphism. these results have implicated various biological functions, including circadian rhythm, in sexual dimorphism in cattle.fig.  <dig> diagram representing the relationship of significantly detected sex related cluster and their go-terms by david clustering analysis. each box and line represents go-terms and relationships, respectively. the figure was generated by quickgo  <cit>  with our detected biological terms using david. in this diagram, coloring boxes are significant in our analysis



technical validation to detect sexually dimorphic genes in two different species using qrt-pcr
technical validation was performed using qrt-pcr in order to 1) technically validate detected sexual dimorphic genes by comparing expressed genes between rna-seq and qrt-pcr in cattle; and 2) compare cattle and rat to investigate whether validated sexually dimorphic genes are shared between these two different mammal species. using two statistical approaches, m <dig> and m <dig>  we identified  <dig> significant  sexually dimorphic genes. of these detected degs,  <dig> genes were randomly selected from the known primer sequence in cattle  and rat  species and qrt-pcr was performed in order to compare not only rna-seq vs. qrt-pcr in cattle, but also cattle vs. rat. to examine global gene expression among three experiments, a comparative heatmap was visualized using quantile-normalized values . first, most gene expression patterns were observed to be analogous between qrt-pcr and rna-seq ). in order to quantitatively assess this observation, pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated using the log-fold change ratio between male and female among the three experiments as shown in fig. 5-. as a result, high correlation coefficients  were observed in bovine rna-seq and qrt-pcr. on the other hand, small correlation coefficients  were observed between cattle and rat. in order to compare this validation result in another aspect, statistical tests were performed on our qrt-pcr results . as the  <dig> sexually dimorphic genes were derived from rna-seq analysis using a generalized linear model  such as m <dig>  and m <dig> , a t-test and analysis of variance  were employed to apply similar statistical tests for qrt-pcr analysis. most detected sexually dimorphic genes were significantly found in cattle and rat species using qrt-pcr. this statistical result reveals that although gene-expression patterns of the two species are not identical, sexually dimorphic genes can be commonly identified in both species. to examine this phenomenon, hierarchical clustering analysis was performed using gene expression data from the  <dig> genes using the cluster r package. euclidean distance was employed for determining the distance among samples and calculating representative distance in each branch of the cluster. in addition, silhouette scores were calculated for detecting the optimal number of clusters for each of the three types of datasets. as a result, the optimal number of clusters, k, was estimated as  <dig> for rna-seq on cattle and qrt-pcr on rat, but was estimated as  <dig> for qrt-pcr on cattle. based on these estimated optimal number of clusters, hierarchical cut-trees were visualized for each dataset . the three trees reveal not only that samples can be clearly distinguished by tissue, but also that samples are clearly divided based on sex in each tissue. these technically validated  <dig> selected genes were revealed to be sexually dimorphic genes in both cattle and rat species. finally, of  <dig> randomly selected degs,  <dig> were significantly detected in m <dig>  in order to measure the accuracy of the m <dig>  statistical results of qrt-pcr and rna-seq were compared . as a result,  <dig> genes were technically validated in qrt-pcr .fig.  <dig> relative heatmap drawn using  <dig> randomly selected sexual dimorphic genes from cattle rna-seq analysis. the intensities included in the relative heatmap represent quantile-normalized values. a qrt-pcr result using  <dig> biological replicated samples for cattle species b gene expression from the rna-seq in cattle species c qrt-pcr result using  <dig> biological replicated samples in rat species. d quantification of the similarities among three experiments. pearson’s correlation coefficients were employed with logged <dig> fold-changes  in each experiment

discussion
bovine sex-chromosomal genes detected from rna-seq analysis
as we excluded genes with very low expression levels  in this study, we expected all y-linked genes to exhibit significant male-biased expression. however, only a few y-linked non-degs were identified as a result of our analyses. of  <dig> annotated genes based on the bostau <dig> reference genome, five genes  were not significantly detected in m <dig> and m <dig>  three genes  had extremely low tmm normalized values. tbl1x and znf280b showed a large tmm normalized value  . to investigate the possibility of cross-mapping between each of the gene and its paralogues, local alignment was performed using the znf280b mrna-sequence to the reference genome using a basic local alignment search tool . as a result, we not only observed the znf280b gene with 98 % query cover rate, but also expression of an un-annotated gene located in chromosome  <dig> with a 92 % query cover rate. in addition, a previous study identified znf280b as a autosome derived y-chromosome gene  <cit> . therefore, appearance of y-linked non-degs may be attributed to their low expression or to variable between replicates to be found differentially expressed, or could be caused by two genes in the reference gene with similar sequences.

we observed no male-biased genes on the x chromosome at fdr adjusted p-value <  <dig>  . however, three x-linked genes were significantly up-regulated in males at fdr adjusted p-value <  <dig>  . three genes; zic <dig> , cxhxorf <dig> , and tmem <dig>  showed relatively little difference in expression between females and males, but also high individual variations compared to the other  <dig> significantly observed sexually dimorphic genes . of the  <dig> x-chromosomal annotated genes,  <dig> were female-biased degs detected in either m <dig> or m <dig>  these genes may serve a good candidates for x-chromosome inactivation escaping gene in cattle species . in muscle tissue, five such genes were identified: ca5b , rbm <dig> , sh3kbp <dig> , xpnpep <dig> , and xist . additionally, nxf <dig> , xist , and zfx  were detected as degs in pituitary-gland tissue.

of these genes, only one x-linked gene, xist, was commonly identified in several tissues. xist was significantly detected using m <dig> and m <dig> . however, xist was not significantly detected in liver tissue; this result was surprising, as we expected this female-specific x-inactivation related gene to be included in whole tissues. examination of raw data revealed expression outliers in the liver in both female and male , which resulted in no statistical significance  and eventually eliminated xist from the deg list.

sexual dimorphism displayed in metabolic tissues and pituitary gland
we investigated causes for why male biased genes were enriched only in pituitary-gland tissue. numerous muscle development related gene-sets were significantly reported by david including striated muscle tissue development , muscle tissue development , cardiac muscle tissue morphogenesis , muscle tissue morphogenesis , cardiac muscle tissue development , skeletal muscle tissue development , and skeletal muscle organ development  among others .. results of previous studies  <cit> , have shown that androgens play a highly important role in the development of muscle and bone, particularly in males. it appears that significantly detected sexual dimorphic genes in pituitary-gland tissue show male-biased enrichment given that many of the genes found significant in this tissue play an important role in muscle development. the results revealed that the effect of muscle tissue on about sex differences in gene expression is higher than that of other tissues. these results are consistent with earlier findings from studies using m <dig>  these results and the number of detected genes imply that gene expression in muscle tissues is more impacted by sexually dimorphism than other tissues.

the pituitary gland is a critical structure for rhythmic control of metabolism and reproduction; this function is the result of hormones such as growth hormone  and the gonadotropins being secreted in a pulsatile manner. although the relationship among sexual dimorphism, metabolism and rhythmic process is complicated and not well-understood, identification of significant rhythmic process-related genes and pathways might indicate physiological roles of the pituitary gland and its effects on peripheral tissues. for instance, it is well recognized that a large number of sex differences in liver gene expression are controlled by the central circadian system  as well as result from the pulsatility of circulating gh  <cit> . however, a non-circadian role for core circadian oscillators cannot be excluded  <cit> , and the circadian rhythm-related genes may be de regulated downstream of these signaling cascades. taken together, results of this study suggest that pituitary gland-expressed genes might at least be partly involved in the cascade of events starting with secretion of hormone, gene expression in peripheral tissues and, finally, establishment of sexual dimorphism in metabolic processes.

degree of sexual dimorphism in abdominal fat tissue gene expression
results from rna-seq analysis performed using m <dig> revealed that degs detected from abdominal fat tissue not only showed very little tissue specificity compared to liver, muscle, and pituitary gland, but also the lowest number of detected sexual dimorphic genes. this suggests that most of the genes found significant in fat tissue have a smaller effect on sexual dimorphism than the other tissues. sex biased differences in fatty acid metabolism and regional fat distribution have been well recognized in previous studies  <cit> . however, the number of studies on sex differences in gene expression of abdominal fat is limited and insufficient to elucidate the degree of sexual dimorphism in fat tissue. meanwhile, several studies have reported that some aspects of visceral adipose tissue function appear to act independent of sex. for example, a previous study reported that no sex differences in androgen binding  <cit>  and estrogen receptor expression  <cit>  can be observed in human adipose tissue. furthermore, another possible reason for the detection of fewer degs in fat tissue than in other tissues could be the breeding strategy for korean native cattle, which was the species studied in the present study. because highly marbled beef is preferred by consumers and manufacturers in the korean beef industry, the cattle breeding system is mainly focused on increasing fat marbling  <cit> , which most likely has caused a gradual decrease in gene expression differences between female and male. further investigation at the transcriptomic, proteomic and physiological levels should be performed to conclude whether fat depots possess a lesser extent of sexual dimorphism compared to other metabolic tissues.

we observed a large number of pituitary gland up-regulated in males, while the majority of liver, fat and muscle degs were up-regulated in females. there have been several previous studies that compared sexual dimorphism at a gene expression level between tissues, including the pituitary gland  <cit> . while these results do not explain why pituitary gland genes appear to show sex-specific expression patterns, it may be beneficial for future studies to identify whether male-biased gene expression pattern in the pituitary gland appear in other species such as human and rodents.

comparison of two statistical approaches for detecting sexual dimorphic genes using two-way factorial designed data
in this paper, we used two statistical approaches, m <dig> and m <dig>  to detect sexually dimorphic genes from two-way factorial rna-seq data. m <dig>  the simplest method for discovering degs, involves performing two group comparisons between female and male in each tissue. from this approach, a list of sexual dimorphic genes was for each individual tissue. using these results, tissue specific sexually dimorphic genes  or commonly identified genes in several tissues was identified by comparing lists of significant genes. although our rna-seq experiment produced  <dig> rna-seq samples from  <dig> tissues, the m <dig> approach used only  <dig>  vs.  <dig>  samples from each tissue. due to this small sample size, a relatively smaller number of degs were detected by m <dig> compared to m2; this issue of sample size leads to a loss of statistical power when using this model. this problem is widely discussed in microarray analysis ; comparison between t-test and contrast anova reveals that contrast based methods are more statistically powerful than a simple two group test, since a contrast based approach makes it possible for more elaborate variance estimation given the larger number of samples used. additionally, estimation of the interaction effect between two factors is only possible using an integrated model. given these advantages, an anova type model on glm, the anodev, has been developed for rna-seq data analysis. by employing anodev, we can consider more complex structured experimental design on the statistical model  <cit> . by considering several factors on the model, more degs can be significantly detected by increasing sample size. as we had expected, when applying these two statistical approaches for detection of sexual dimorphic genes, different patterns of detected degs were observed . this difference is mainly due to the different statistical assumptions of each approach. in short, while m <dig> is suitable for finding tissue-specific sexually dimorphic genes, its statistical power is lower than the integrated model, which leads to a high rate of false negatives. in contrast, while m <dig> tends to detect more significant genes than m <dig>  it has a relatively higher rate of false positives. we observed a  <dig>  false positive rate  based on qrt-pcr validation results;  <dig> genes were significantly identified in rna-seq analysis with m <dig>  while  <dig> genes were found not significant in the qrt-pcr result . this highly false positive rate may be attributed to a broken equal variance assumption. m <dig> assumes equal variance of each individual, however, highly tissue-specific patterns of gene expression make it difficult to precisely detect degs. this result suggests that equal variance can not be guaranteed when employing several tissues in rna-seq analysis. furthermore, in general rna-seq experiments where testing on multiple tissues was performed, tissue samples were extracted from one individual, which leads to a complex correlated structure; this is referred to as a nested design  <cit> . one solution, which has already been suggested in microarray studies  <cit> , is to estimate coefficients in the model using the weighted least squares  method, which would allow for consideration of complex correlation structure. in addition, a generalized estimating equation  model could also be applied for repeated measure rna-seq data analysis  <cit> . although an anodev model implemented in edger and deseq <dig>  <cit>  is able to consider this nested design by adding fixed-effect dummy variables for distinguishing nested variables, this is merely a second-best solution. development of new methodology would allow for more accurate estimation using samples taken from several tissues. another inconvenience of m <dig> is that we cannot distinguish the effect of specific tissues because post hoc analysis is not yet provided for rna-seq studies. this issue has been widely discussed in regards to microarray data analysis on multilevel dataset  <cit> . in short, by performing post-hoc test on each tissue  after the testing main factor , we are able to determine which tissue’s effect causes a sex difference. unfortunately, as far as we know, no known attempts have been made to develop post-hoc test in rna-seq analysis so far. more research is required to develop accurate methods for analysis multi-factor designed data using an integrated model based approach.

while statistical tests were performed using edger in this study, deseq <dig> also provides anodev. the list of degs resulting from an analysis could be highly influenced by several factors including choice of aligner, counter, statistical tools, and specific parameters. unfortunately, it is nearly impossible to determine the optimal pipeline for each individual study given the high number of possible combinations of those factors. in this study, we mainly focused on the comparing between statistical models; m <dig> and m <dig>  therefore other variable factors should be fixed. however, since the results derived from the edger can be uniquely observed, we additionally compared m <dig> and m <dig> in deseq <dig> for identifying differences between edger and deseq <dig>  as a result, high correlations  were observed between these two statistical tools . in addition, larger numbers of degs were detected when using deseq <dig> . third, m <dig> has stronger statistical power than m <dig>  which was observed in edger and deseq <dig> . finally, high tissue specificity was detected in deseq <dig> . from these results, we conclude that although patterns of the test results from the edger and deseq <dig> are very similar, a larger number of degs and higher strong tissue specificity can be observed when using deseq <dig> 

in summary, although m <dig> was able to detect degs in multiple factorial rna-seq data, m <dig> appears to be more suitable for the detection of sexually dimorphic genes with considering several tissue than m <dig> in terms of stability. as integrated model based approaches become more developed, those which consider heterogeneity variance and post-hoc analysis may provide a suitable way to detect degs in multi-factors designed rna-seq data.

upon performing technical verification, although gene expression patterns were shown to be different between cattle and rat, a large number of sexually dimorphic genes were commonly validated . of  <dig> randomly selected candidate genes,  <dig> were commonly identified in both species including cux <dig>  ddx3y, usp9y, znf280b, and etc. in addition,  <dig> candidate genes, apod, cyp7a <dig>  gabbr <dig>  gnal, slc17a <dig>  stxbp5l, tbl1x, and catsper <dig>  were technically validated in bovine qrt-pcr experiment, but those genes were not significant in rat species. in results of qrt-pcr analysis,  <dig> candidate genes were not significantly detected including adm, ampd <dig>  hoxd <dig>  rgs <dig>  slc6a <dig>  ucp <dig>  and me <dig>  of these genes, only me <dig> was not significantly detected in either species; the others were significantly detected in only rat species. cux <dig> is well-known as a female-biased gene in mice  <cit> . as shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  cux <dig> was shown to be female-biased gene rat liver tissue, but was identified as male-biased in cattle. znf280b and rab3c showed diametrical patterns between the two species. these genes may serve as strong candidate markers for determination of sexual dimorphism in specific species. of particular interest is usp9y, which is a representative y-linked gene. usp9y has been known to show extremely low expression level in the brain of mice  <cit> , which is supported by our results . contrastively, we observed that usp9y was highly expressed in bovine whole tissues. statistical qrt-pcr results showed that although usp9y was not significantly detected in liver, muscle, and pituitary-gland tissues, it was significant in rat fat tissue . for this reason, although usp9y appears to not be significant in most rat tissues, the gene may be related to rodent sexual dimorphism. on the other hand, we observed high bovine expression levels of this gene, which indicate that usp9y is strong candidate gene for identification of bovine sexually dimorphism.

strong positive correlations among the tissues within the experiment were observed ) . of  <dig> degs randomly selected for qrt-pcr based technical validation,  <dig> sexually dimorphic genes were significantly detected in m <dig>  m <dig> was able detect generally different genes across tissues . strong positive correlations among tissues may be explained by specific features of m <dig>  in order to examine this phenomenon, qrt-pcr and rna-seq results were compared . of  <dig> significantly reported genes in rna-seq,  <dig> were significantly identified using qrt-pcr. this result reveals that m <dig> is an attractive solution for detection of sexually dimorphic genes in multi-factorial designed rna-seq data given its high reproducibility.

finally, only  <dig> sexually dimorphic genes were used in order to compare the two species. while the need for cross-species transcriptome analysis has increased as interest in transcriptional evolution peaks, only a few studies have attempted to organize gene expression comparison among species  <cit> . several factors make cross-species comparison of gene expression data difficult:  rna sampling from the homologue across the species;  construction of the orthologous gene-set across the species;  normalization of the gene expression for different length gene; and  compounding effects between species and other biases. due to these reasons, most transcriptional cross-species studies have been performed at using meta-analysis based approaches rather than mega-analysis based ones . decisively, samples from multiple tissues should be matched in each meta-data set and considered in the gene expression study for sexually dimorphism given the highly tissue-specific pattern observed in our result. we performed qrt-pcr experiments on cattle and rat species to meet the minimum requirement for meta-study among multiple species. while our results do not compare a large number of sexually dimorphic genes, it may be beneficial in future studies to compare gene expression between species on a larger scale. as far as we know, this is first attempt to construct comparative heatmaps across species and multiple platforms . although these heatmaps provide relative gene expression patterns among three results, absolute intensities of color would be not important in cross-species comparison as most researchers would focus on detecting opposite tendencies among the species as was observed with cux <dig> and usp9y. however, one limitation of qrt-pcr platform is that gene expression of genes can often be undetermined; some genes, including ucp in fat tissue and slc6a <dig> in liver and muscle tissue, showed strong blue intensity ). development of methodology may be able to resolve this issue for future studies on rna-seq based cross-species data.

CONCLUSIONS
in order to investigate bovine sexually dimorphism, rna-seq analysis was performed using two distinct statistical approaches. as a result, numerous sexually dimorphic genes and pathways were successfully identified across various tissues; expression showed strong tissue-specific patterns. for verification of the identified bovine sexually dimorphic genes, qrt-pcr experiments were performed in cattle and rat species, respectively. results revealed that while sexually dimorphic genes are shared between these two mammal species, gene expression patterns vary across tissues. results of our study have revealed that many biological processes might be involved in sexual dimorphism of metabolic tissues in cattle. particularly, the expression patterns of sexually dimorphic genes in the pituitary gland indicated not only the effect of sexual dimorphism of the brain itself, but also of the central nervous system on peripheral tissues in determining differences between sexes. finally, we concluded that two statistical approaches have their advantages and disadvantages in rna-seq studies considering multiple tissues.
