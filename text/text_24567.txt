BACKGROUND
faba bean  is currently the third most important cool-season food legume in the world. faba bean provides an important source of dietary protein in human diet, edible oil and animal feeds. like other grain legumes, faba bean contributes to sustainable agriculture in the management of soil fertility and plays an essential role in crop rotation. faba bean is a diploid with 2n = 2x =  <dig> chromosomes  <cit> , is partially cross-pollinated ranging from  <dig> to 84%  <cit> , and possesses one of the largest genomes among crop legumes . the development of saturated linkage maps as well as the identification and map-based isolation of important qualitative traits or quantitative trait loci is therefore complex and expensive.

a saturated genetic linkage map provides an invaluable tool in plant genetic studies and practical breeding. one of the first genetic linkage maps of faba bean was constructed by van de ven et al.  <cit>  with only  <dig> markers; followed by successively more detailed genetic maps by torres et al.  <cit>  with  <dig> markers, satovic et al.  <cit>  with  <dig> markers, vaz patto et al.  <cit>  with  <dig> markers, roman et al.  <cit>  with  <dig> markers, roman et al.  <cit>  with  <dig> markers and avila et al.  <cit>  with  <dig> markers. to date, faba bean genetic maps have been restricted to morphological, isozyme, rflp, rapd, a few seed protein genes and four ssr markers. these markers have been limited either in number, transferability or in their ability to provide syntenic information with other legume species.

the recent generation of abundant genomic and genetic resources focussed around the model species medicago truncatula and lotus japonicus has opened up abundant opportunities for creating gene-based molecular markers that are ideal for genetic mapping in general and comparative mapping in particular  <cit> . in this approach, oligonucleotide primers were designed from sequences of conserved regions in gene exons that flank polymorphic regions such as introns or microsatellites. this pcr-based, codominant marker system has remarkably increased the efficiency of transferring genetic information across species. examples include the comparison of m. truncatula with alfalfa, pea, chickpea, soybean, mung bean, lentil and lupins  <cit> .

comparative genomic studies can expose and confirm phylogenetic relationships among species and determine patterns of chromosomal evolution and syntenic relationships. more importantly, comprehensive comparative genomics can facilitate back-and-forth use of genomic resources between different legumes species, and help to reduce cost and increase efficiency in genetic research as well as crop breeding. the use of conserved genome structure to assist in transferring knowledge among related plant species is well established in grasses  <cit>  where synteny greatly assists in gene identification among related species.

in this paper we report:  the application of gene-based markers in faba bean;  the development of the first exclusively gene-based genetic and comparative map for the species;  analysis of syntenic relationship between faba bean and m. truncatula; and  the levels of homology existing between faba bean, m. truncatula and lentil, a closely related species to faba bean.

methods
genetic mapping population
a gene-based genetic map of faba bean genome was constructed using a population of  <dig> f <dig> rils generated from a cross between faba bean line vf <dig>  as the pollen recipient and line vf <dig> as pollen donor . these accessions have been widely used in previous genetic studies  <cit>  and the population was developed at ifapa, centro alameda del obispo, in córdoba, spain, using diploid parental individuals. total genomic dna was isolated from each parent and f <dig> individual as previously described  <cit> .

primer design
a total of  <dig> intron-targeted amplified polymorphic markers  were used for this study. these were composed of four sets of itaps;  <dig> ml and lup primers developed from alignment of m. truncatula and lupinus spp. database est sequences;  <dig> mlg primers based on alignments between m. truncatula, lupinus albus, and glycine max ;  <dig> cross-species makers  developed by the department of plant pathology, university of california, davis, usa  <cit> ; and  <dig> glip markers created by the european grain legumes integrated project  based on primarily on m. truncatula and pea . the majority of the itaps markers could be positioned to a physical location in the m. truncatula psuedogenome since most primers were designed from genes in characterized chromosomal regions.

polymorphism detection
each primer pair was screened on v. faba parental dna. pcr conditions were optimised to produce clear single amplicons, and single pcr products of the same size were purified and directly sequenced. different detection methods were used to genotype the f <dig> population dependent on the type of polymorphism  <cit> . details of each marker are given in additional file  <dig> 

map construction
chi-squared analysis  was applied to test the segregation of the mapped markers against the expected mendelian segregation ratio for co-dominant inheritance in the faba bean f <dig> ril population. genetic linkage mapping was conducted with multipoint v  <dig>  software  <cit> , with a recombination fraction  of  <dig>   using  <dig> bootstraps. map distances were calculated in cm by applying the "kosambi" function. groups of linked markers that were similarly distorted were accepted for linkage mapping. independent markers showing significant segregation distortion and markers with missing data  were rejected for linkage to avoid bias and false linkages. genetic maps were drawn with the software program mapchart v  <dig>   <cit> .

establishment of macrosyntenic relationships between faba bean, lentil and m. truncatula
markers mapped in faba bean were located on the m. truncatula map by aligning the ests originally used to design the itaps primers with m. truncatula bacs in the medicago pseudogenome mt <dig>  build 8/10/ <dig>  alignments with a blast e values < 1e- <dig>  hsp identity ≥ 60%, and hsp length >  <dig> nt were retained. precise positions of markers were obtained by aligning the itap primer sequences with m. truncatula bacs using blastn with an expected value < 1e- <dig> . approximate positions of markers that had been genetically mapped in m. truncatula but not yet positioned on the physical map were obtained from the m. truncatula genetic map  <cit> .

loci dot plot created via grid map
grid map  <cit>  was used to compare the genetic maps of faba bean and m. truncatula. ordered loci from faba bean and m. truncatula linkage groups were listed vertically and horizontally, respectively, and dots were positioned on the diagram at the intersection of the locations of the corresponding markers in the two genetic maps.

RESULTS
gene-based marker development
of the  <dig> markers screened for amplification in genomic faba bean dna, 19% produced two or more amplicons of different sizes. five hundred and seven were selected and optimised for single-locus amplification. fifty percent  of these produced clear single band amplicons . seven markers that produced two amplicons  and one that produced three amplicons  were also mapped as they exhibited convenient length polymorphisms. one hundred and sixty-five polymorphic markers were identified , of which  <dig> markers were used to genotype the  <dig> individuals of the f <dig> ril population . apart from the glip markers which were selected for their ability to amplify faba bean genomic dna before this study, 'mlg' and 'mp' markers worked equally well in faba bean  but 'mp' markers produced fewer polymorphic amplicons. amplification rate of the 'ml' markers was the poorest , less than half the rate of the 'mlg' and 'mp' groups . likewise, the polymorphism level of the 'ml' markers was the lowest. both 'mlg' and 'glip' markers produced very high levels of polymorphism in the mapping parents . dna sequences of markers have been submitted to genbank under accession codes fh <dig> – fh <dig>

bfigures in parentheses are percentages of sequenced markers of the total amplified markers.

cfigures in parentheses are percentages of polymorphic markers of the total sequenced markers.

nineteen mapped markers  deviated significantly  from the expected mendelian inheritance ratio of 1: <dig>  about half of these markers  were highly distorted . fifty percent of the distorted markers segregated in favour of the vf <dig> parent and fifty percent in favour of vf <dig>  nine of the  <dig> faba bean lgs contained one to four of these distorted markers, which tended to be scattered throughout the faba bean genome. however, it is noteworthy that distorted markers grouped together in chromosomes fb- <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .

the first gene-based and comparative map of faba bean
a total of  <dig> genic markers were used to generate the first gene-based and comparative map of faba bean. this map was constructed with a recombination fraction of  <dig>  . the map consists of seven main linkage groups  and  <dig> fragments , which varied in length from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm, and spans a total of nearly  <dig> cm . the number of markers per lg ranged from three to  <dig> markers. in addition, there was one pair and thirteen unlinked markers. eight markers co-segregated at four loci, . the maximum distances between markers ranged from  <dig>  cm in fb- <dig> to  <dig>  cm in fb- <dig> with an overall mean gap distance of  <dig>  cm .

acalculated by dividing the length of the chromosome  by the number of space/distance between markers/loci.

of the  <dig> genic markers that mapped to the  <dig> faba bean lgs in figure  <dig>   <dig> were assigned to the m. truncatula genetic or physical maps  <cit> . one hundred and four of these  were in syntenic regions. clear evidence of a simple and direct macrosyntenic relationship between the v. faba and m. truncatula is presented in the dot matrix in figure  <dig>  the formation of clear isoclinic diagonal lines along the linkage groups provides a strong indication of the conservation of gene order in the two legume genomes. the extensive colinearity was particularly prevailing between fb lg  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and mt lg  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> where syntenic regions accounted for 90%, 86%, 50% and 47% of the m. truncatula pseudogenome, respectively .

na: not applicable

1data was either based on information from m. truncatula genome sequencing website  <cit>  or from choi et al.  <cit> .

2data is provided for three or more colinear markers and excludes markers on the same chromosome rearranged relative to the order in m. truncatula.

however, chromosomal rearrangements were also evident at a moderate level. for example, m. truncatula chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> together with  <dig> and  <dig> merged to form the faba bean lgs  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. similarly, m. truncatula chromosome  <dig> splits into fb-  <dig> and  <dig> and m. truncatula chromosome  <dig> into fb- <dig> and  <dig> . inversions and translocations were also notable among the orthologous markers within each syntenic pair of faba bean and m. truncatula lgs .

evidence of macrosynteny among faba bean, lentil and medicago truncatula
a high level of co-linearity was found between the faba bean, lentil and m. truncatula genomes based on the macro-synteny established between faba bean and m. truncatula  or lentil and m. truncatula  <cit>  using only common orthologous markers which mapped in all three species . the pattern of homology between faba bean and m. truncatula was similar to that between lentil and m. truncatula: for example, two linkage groups fb- <dig> and len-ii were exclusively syntenic to m. truncatula lg_ <dig> and shared seven markers in common. common markers were evenly distributed in all the three corresponding lgs suggesting that fb- <dig> and len-ii are essentially co-linear . likewise, fb- <dig> and len-iii were both syntenic to mt- <dig> and orthologous to each other with nine markers in common . other examples are fb- <dig>  len-i and mt-4; and fb- <dig>  len-v and mt- <dig> . fb- <dig> and fb- <dig> were co-linear with lentil len-vii and lenvi, respectively, and both pairs of these linkage groups were colinear with mt- <dig> . this suggests shared ancestral chromosomal changes in faba bean and lentil compared to m. truncatula and confirms their phylogenetically closer relationship.

evidence of fine scale macrosynteny on individual bacs between faba bean, lentil and medicago truncatula
several itap markers used in this study were designed from different genes on the same m. truncatula bacs. these markers often mapped in clusters in two or more species and in common syntenic regions of corresponding linkage groups. an example is shown in figure 3a with markers lg89-lg <dig> designed from m. truncatula bac ac <dig> and lg83-lg <dig> from m. truncatula bac ac <dig> in m. truncatula chromosome  <dig>  similarly, with the exception of lg34c, markers lg31-lg <dig> designed from m. truncatula bac ac <dig> in mt chromosome  <dig> were located in one area of fb- <dig> and len-iii as shown in figure 3b; markers anmtl6-anmtl <dig> and lg102-lg <dig> from m. truncatula bac ac <dig> and ac <dig> in mt chromosome  <dig> were grouped together on corresponding pairs of lgs i.e. fb- <dig> and len-vii and fb- <dig> and len-vi; respectively .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the first genetic map of faba bean composed exclusively with gene-based co-dominant molecular markers was constructed using a f <dig> ril population between lines vf <dig> and vf <dig>  the map is also the first to enable the establishment of syntenic relationships between faba bean and the model legume m. truncatula, comparison with other legume species, and integration with genetic maps available in faba bean.

the map is composed of  <dig> linkage groups and  <dig> genetic markers. although the number of chromosomes in faba bean has been reported as 2n =  <dig>  <cit> , the number of linkage groups in recent genetic maps in the species range from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit>  and previously as many as  <dig> have been reported  <cit> . the high number of linkage groups compared to the number of chromosomes may be due to the fact that faba bean possesses one of the largest genomes among cultivated legumes . this compares with other well-characterised species such as m. truncatula, chickpea, soybean, lentil and pea which have genomes of ~ <dig> mb, ~ <dig> mb, ~ <dig> mb, ~ <dig> mb and ~ <dig> mb respectively  <cit> .

of the  <dig> non-orthologous markers found in this study, eight were from primer pairs where more than one pcr gel band was present and where two or more such amplicons were mapped. in each case, at least one amplicon mapped syntenically. the percentages of markers sequenced in faba bean were lower compared to lentil . this was due to higher proportion of markers amplifying multiple bands in faba bean compared to lentil , which may imply duplication. differences in amplification, sequencing and polymorphism rates among different types of markers used for this study reflect the mode of design of the markers. since 'mp' and 'mlg' markers were often based on the homology of more than two phylogenetically distant species, they are more likely to work in different legume lineages. the same observation was reported for these primer sets in lentil  <cit> .

despite the large differences in genome sizes between m. truncatula and v. faba, a simple and direct relationship between the two genomes was identified in this study. given the number of markers used , the syntenic regions cover a large proportion of m. truncatula pseudogenome with 90%, 87%, 66%, 62% and 47% for m. truncatula chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . the appearance of clear isoclinic diagonal lines along the linkage groups in figure  <dig> also demonstrates strong evidence for the extensive co-linearity between linkage group pairs of the two species. similar high levels of conservation have also been reported between l. culinaris ssp. culinaris and m. truncatula  <cit>  and other closely related legumes such as l. culinaris ssp. culinaris and p. sativum  <cit> , m. sativa and p. sativum  <cit> , m. truncatula and p. sativum  <cit> , m. truncatula and m. sativa  <cit> . this study also shows markers originally designed from genes on the same bac clustered in corresponding syntenic areas in lentil and faba bean. the mapping populations were too small to resolve marker order in lentil and faba bean but extensive conservation of gene order, has been shown in previous studies between other legume species at similar or greater phylogenetic distances  <cit> , and to some extent between m. truncatula and arabidopsis  <cit> .

a higher level of homology between v. faba and l. culinaris ssp. culinaris compared to that between v. faba and m. truncatula could be inferred from this study based on the common markers mapped in the two genomes, common homology with m. truncatula and similar pattern of rearrangements . this finding agrees with phylogenetic studies that place the genera vicia, lens and pisum within the tribe viceae while medicago and melilotus form a parallel tribe trifolieae within the galegoid or cool season legumes  <cit> , and is consistent with different levels of macrosynteny observed between m. truncatula, p. sativum, v. radiata, g. max, and phaceolus vulgaris dependent on phylogenetic distance  <cit> . however, chromosomal rearrangements were evident .

rearrangements involving mt <dig> and mt <dig> in particular may explain the differences in chromosome number between the two species . mt <dig> might be considered unusual and is largely composed of heterochromatic dna  <cit> , contains few transcribed genes  <cit>  and a large proportion of resistance gene analogues  <cit> . in this study no corresponding linkage group was detected in faba bean, as found previously in pea  <cit>  and lupin  <cit> , together with less than five percent estimated coverage by the l. japonicus genome  <cit> . in faba bean fb <dig> and fb <dig> appear to correspond to mt <dig>  this configuration is supported by a similar pattern in lentil , although a larger number of markers are needed to confirm this.

the faba bean comparative map constructed here is consistent with the pattern of chromosome conservation previously observed, where different levels of conservation were found to be relatively consistent between m. truncatula and other legume species i.e. high conservation of m. truncatula chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and 8; moderate conservation in the m. truncatula chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and lowest conservation in the m. truncatula chromosome  <dig> . as described above, no homology was identified with m. truncatula chromosome  <dig> in this study. the alignment of this faba bean map with lentil and the current m. truncatula genome based on m. truncatula genome assembly mt <dig>  is slightly different to that based on an earlier assembly  <cit> . the changes can be observed in figure 3b where orthologous markers which were syntenic to m. truncatula chromosome  <dig> in lentil are now co-linear with m. truncatula chromosome  <dig> in common with faba bean.

genome studies have demonstrated different factors are responsible for genome size variation and speciation. these include ancient polyploidisation events in the case of the brassicas  <cit> ; segmental or region-specific duplication  <cit> ; and genetic rearrangements, transposable element amplification, or combination of different genome modifications  <cit> . large scale rearrangements, duplications, or polyploidisation were not apparent in this study, possibly as a result of the focus on single locus markers, however differences in non-coding repetitive dna or transposable elements provide a possible explanation for the large differences in genome size. retroelements are known to account for substantial proportions of these viceae genomes as shown by extensive studies in pea, for example  <cit> , and more recently vicia  <cit> . local genic rearrangements similar to that in found in the grasses  may explain multiple pcr amplicons  <cit> .

the shared macrosynteny among the three species demonstrated here and even higher level of homology between l. culinaris and v. faba will undoubtedly facilitate the identification of markers closely linked to traits of interest in v. faba. alignment of this map with existing faba bean maps containing important traits with polymorphic ssr markers and/or markers developed in this study, coupled with cross-reference to the abundant genetic information from the medicago genome sequencing and extensive est libraries available for the model legume species, will undoubtedly assist this process. as the parental line vf <dig> has been used in a number of genetic and qtl mapping projects  <cit> , this map can serve as a central reference map. this study has provided a number of significant outcomes for faba bean genomics and legume genomics in general.
