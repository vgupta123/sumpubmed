BACKGROUND
the introduction of efficient transgenesis into the field of developmental biology opened the possibility to eradicate cells through the incorporation of tissue-specific and inducible toxic proteins  <cit> , with cell death as an experimental endpoint. in addition, the ability to dose-dependently modulate the level of induced damage may be even more useful when investigating the long-term effects of experimental insult and/or recovery of affected cells. fluorescent proteins not only faithfully report the presence of tagged proteins but, upon illumination, they also generate reactive oxygen species . the level of ros generated can be modulated by a dose of illumination and evaluated by photobleaching of fluorescent proteins  <cit> . different levels of ros cause different effects: at low levels, ros can promote cell division or differentiation; at intermediate levels - growth arrest; and at high levels - apoptosis. hence, an intense illumination of fluorescent transgenic animals may, in principle, generate enough ros to overcome the ability of cells to detoxify the reactive intermediates and thereby induce a state of oxidative stress. overt production of ros also damages the membrane and induces single strand breaks in the dna. probable biological outcomes, in increasing dose-dependent manner, are functional impairment, genetic instability resulting in somatic mutations or cell death  <cit> .

currently, reliable research tools to study the effects of ros in vivo, that would enable both dose-dependent control and tissue specificity of ros production, are not available. the green fluorescent protein  is mildly phototoxic under aerobic conditions, but since most vertebrates tolerate gfp phototoxicity, these toxic effects are low enough to be ignored  <cit> . in comparison, killerred  is a much more potent photosensitizer, highly toxic, and efficiently produces ros upon illumination  <cit> . using purified kr and chemical probes to detect superoxide and singlet oxygen, it was shown that both types of ros were produced upon green light irradiation of kr-expressing cells in vitro  <cit> .

the semitransparent embryos of small teleosts, including zebrafish, are ideal for laser-mediated cell-ablation experiments  <cit> . we decided to explore the possibility of manipulating cells in dose-dependent manner in living, kr-expressing zebrafish embryos using widely available microscopes. several stable transgenic lines, with tissue-specific expression of membrane-tethered kr , were made using the efficient tol <dig> transposon-mediated enhancer trap transgenesis  <cit> . the kr-specific phototoxic effect in the cns and heart of living vertebrates that we observed demonstrates for the first time the possibility to manipulate the viability and/or function of kr-expressing cells, and illustrates the utility of kr-expressing zebrafish transgenics as living tools to study the effects of ros in vivo.

RESULTS
the tol2-kr screen
to test whether the kr would remain an efficient photosensitizer in developing zebrafish embryos, the cytosolic gfp reporter in the tol <dig> transposon pbk-cmv enhancer trap  vector  <cit> , carrying a partial epithelial promoter of the keratin <dig> gene, was replaced by the membrane-tethered version of kr . a mix of the mem-kr  plasmid and transposase mrna was injected into one-cell stage zebrafish embryos  <cit>  to initiate random integration of tol <dig> into the genome. injected embryos were raised to sexual maturity when, as adults, they were outcrossed with wild type fish to identify transgenic progeny  with tissue-specific expression of kr. these embryos were grown to maturity as founders of  <dig> families. transposon integration site were mapped using tail-pcr after crossing sexually mature transgenics with wild type fish. expression patterns of kr in et lines were documented by confocal microscopy . the integration sites and flanking genomic sequences of transgenics shown in figure  <dig> are listed in table  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. tol2-mediated transposition into genomic dna was defined by the presence of genomic sequences flanking tol <dig>  not all kr-expressing transgenics resulted from the transposase-mediated transposition. for example, the insertion site in sqkr <dig> is flanked by tol <dig> concatemer  and represents a relatively rare event of random integration of the plasmid dna into the zebrafish genome; i.e. the event that took place independent of tol <dig> transposase activity  <cit> .

a and b represent two independent transposon insertion sites detected by tail-pcr.

to obtain the genomic location of tol <dig> insertions, the flanking sequence reads were blast analyzed against the zebrafish genome sequence database  http://www.ensembl.org. in some cases, the flanking sequence reads were blast analyzed against the unfinished, high-throughput genomic sequence  database or trace archive at ncbi http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/seq/blastgen/blastgen.cgi?pid= <dig>  sequences flanking tol <dig> ends  are highlighted in bold.

photobleaching of mem-kr is associated with increased cytotoxicity
we studied the extent of ros-mediated photodamage associated with in vivo irradiation of  <dig> hpf sqkr2-transgenic embryos expressing mem-kr in rhombomeres   <dig> and  <dig> . previous studies have shown that oxygen is required to elicit the photosensitizer properties of kr in vitro, and a surge in ros production is associated with kr photobleaching  <cit> . therefore, for illumination and imaging, embryos were mounted in uncapped, glass-bottom petri dishes  in 1% low-melting point agarose, where diffusion provides sufficient oxygen to aerate the specimen. to compare the efficiency of different sources of light, kr-expressing embryos were exposed to maximum intensity of white  or green light  from the axiovert  <dig> m upright microscope. after  <dig> min exposure to white light, the sqkr <dig> embryo retained  <dig> % of its fluorescence . in contrast, after  <dig> min exposure to intense green light, the sqkr <dig> embryo retained only 20% of its fluorescence . we next examined the effect of continuous exposure to the  <dig> mw hene <dig> laser at maximal intensity in confocal microscope image capture mode. even after  <dig> min of such treatment, the sqkr <dig> embryo retained  <dig> % of its fluorescence intensity . this demonstrated that kr photobleaching elicited by green light from the mercury lamp in the widefield mode is an efficient way of photobleaching kr in living zebrafish embryos.

we next compared the extent of kr photobleaching and the degree of damage to embryos by measuring the level of damage in dna using the tunel assay on both illuminated control  and sqkr <dig> embryos. during this developmental period, some apoptosis is normally taking place resulting in some staining in controls. since ros are known to diffuse across membranes  <cit> , their effect may spread outside of areas of kr expression. an exposure of kr-positive embryos to intense green light caused substantial increase in the number of cells detected by tunel assay:  <dig> min of exposure to green light resulted in a two-fold increase in the number of tunel-positive cells  as compared to the control . this demonstrated that in vivo photobleaching of kr causes cell death . since sqkr <dig> has both skin and rhombomere-specific expression, we next addressed the contribution of skin-specific mem-kr expression into cell death. ten sets of  <dig> hpf embryos including sqkr <dig>  sqkr15b  and wild type zebrafish embryos , were illuminated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde within three hours after illumination. whole mount zebrafish tunel staining followed by immunohistochemistry to detect kr expression using anti-killerred antibody were carried out to address a question, whether there is an increase in cell death at the site of kr expression . only tunel-positive cells in the hindbrain were counted. an increase in cell death was detected at the site of kr expression in illuminated sqkr <dig> embryos . in fact 60% of apoptotic cells were found within kr-positive rhombomeres  <dig> and  <dig>  the rest are either adjacent to these sites or represent background apoptosis. on average, the number of tunel-positive cells is approximately two-fold higher in sqkr <dig>  when compared to both controls . paired t-test comparing illuminated sqkr <dig> with the controls  further showed that obtained mean values are significantly different . in addition, no significant difference in the number of tunel- positive cells was detected between both controls . thus cells expressing mem-kr are much more prone to illumination-induced dna damage detected by tunel.

kr-mediated heart damage
we next used sqkr <dig> embryos to assess effect of illumination on the heart . the fate of kr-positive cells after illumination was followed in double transgenics of sqkr <dig> and cardiac enhancer trap  transgenics expressing cytosolic gfp in the inner endocardium or outer myocardium  <cit> . comparative morphological analysis of double transgenics of sqkr <dig> and sqet33-mi84a , sqet33-mi <dig>  or sqet33-mi3a  demonstrated that mem-kr enclosed cytosolic gfp-positive cells in both myocardium and endocardium layers , so the red and green signals are present in different subcellular domains.

previous studies have shown that oxidative stress is one of the factors linked to cardiovascular disease and heart failure  <cit> . given that photobleaching of kr efficiently produces ros  <cit>  availability of transgenic zebrafish expressing kr in the heart created a possibility to study the effect of ros on the heart of vertebrate larvae in vivo. confocal imaging of sqkr15/sqet33-mi3a 3dpf larvae before and after  <dig> min exposure of kr-expressing heart  to intense green light showed that bleaching of mem-kr in the heart  does not affect cardiomyocyte-specific gfp expression . one day later all illuminated sqkr15/sqet33-mi3a larvae developed pericardial edema ; this represents a special case of fluid overload. in humans, this condition, which is common when cardiac output and circulation are insufficient, manifests as a form of pulmonary congestion  <cit> . since the larvae do not have lungs and the gills are not developed as yet, an accumulation of fluid occurs in the pericardium. despite the presence of edema in the pericardium, no obvious increase in tunel-positive cells  was observed a day after illumination in the heart of illuminated sqkr15/sqet33-mi3a larvae. the only defect is the visibly distended gfp  atrial myocardium .

in order to show that effect of illumination was dose-dependent, larvae were exposed to  <dig> min illumination by intense green light resulting in a further reduction of mem-kr fluorescence  in the heart. again, pericardial edema developed a day after illumination sqkr15/sqet33-mi3a larvae . in addition to a visibly distended gfp  atrial myocardium, enhanced apoptosis was also observed in this layer . hence prolonged illumination caused irreversible pathological damage. this was never observed after illumination of wild type control .

to document changes in heart contractility, we recorded heartbeat using lsm  <dig> live scanning microscope with continuous image acquisition at  <dig> confocal images per second for  <dig> seconds. m-mode depicting vertical movement of the heart tube edges  over time  was generated  <cit>  immediately before and after illumination. the effect of illumination on pumping efficiency of the heart was compared across each group . in total  <dig> embryos in each group were analyzed.

in all illuminated embryos a heartbeat and contractility were measured before and after illumination. on average, a 20% increase in heartbeat and heart contractility was observed in all illuminated controls  immediately after illumination . we attributed this to a light-induced stress response to illumination. no adverse morphological changes developed in these controls a day after illumination . in contrast, illumination of sqkr15/sqet33-mi3a larvae caused a reverse effect - decrease in the rate of heartbeat and heart contractility . a day after illumination pericardial edema developed in all illuminated sqkr15/sqet33-mi3a larvae . on average a 40% decrease in heartbeat and a 50% reduction in contractility were observed immediately after illuminating sqkr15/sqet33-mi3a larvae . paired t test further demonstrated that the percentage decrease in heartbeat and contractility is significantly different from that in controls  in absence of significant difference between the controls. the decrease in cardiac function observed immediately after illumination of sqkr15/sqet33-mi3a larvae suggested an immediate effect of kr-induced ros production on heartbeat and contractility. since the positive control with basal kr expression in the skin  did not develop edema, the decrease in cardiac output is attributed to kr expression in the heart.

discussion
optogenetic cell ablation is a promising approach for photodynamic therapy  <cit> . since the mem-kr is less efficient in eliciting cell death than its histone-tethered version  <cit> , it may be more applicable for experiments aiming to affect cell physiology through the negative influence of kr-induced ros production, for example on the heart rhythm and contractility. in addition, mem-kr could be a useful tool to study the effect of ros at sub-lethal levels linked to most forms of heart disease, including ischemia and sudden heart failure  <cit> .

here, the embryos of et mem-kr transgenics were used for optogenetic manipulation of cell viability and function in vivo via dose-dependent, ros-induced photodamage through the use of a commonly available mercury lamp rather than more specialized equipment, such as a laser, etc. we noted that mem-kr is more efficient as photosensitizer after illumination with the mercury lamp comparing to that of the laser of confocal microscope. this is attributed to the overall low dose of laser illumination and the fact that the  <dig> nm hene laser line used here is not optimal for kr excitation as the excitation maxima of this photosensitizer is at  <dig> nm. thus, the confocal microscopy with the  <dig> nm hene laser line could be used to document mem-kr expression and cellular morphology before and after a surge of ros production that can be conveniently induced by the mercury lamp attached to the same microscope. in a parallel study we have found that some specialized populations of kr-expressing cells are rather sensitive to illumination . thus one needs to study the dose-dependent effects of laser/mercury lamp illumination in respect of a cell type under the study as these may vary.

the scale of photodamage associated with kr-activated ros depends on various experimental conditions, such as cell type, illumination, oxygenation, and the availability of antioxidants  <cit> . the extent of kr bleaching after illumination could be a good indicator of kr-induced cytotoxicity. in our hands, 80% reduction of the mean fluorescence intensity of mem-kr, as quantified using image j, consistently caused cytotoxicity . other factors affecting the degree of photodamage include tissue transparency, which decreases as development progresses, and the intensity of kr expression; the latter parameter depends on many factors, such as a distance of the insertion site from the enhancer  <cit> , as well as the efficiency of the basic promoter used. the use of krt <dig> basic promoter often results in transgenics with relatively bright expression of fluorescent markers  <cit> , which is probably due to the compatibility between this promoter with various enhancers and the high efficiency of their interactions  <cit> . the use of krt <dig> basic promoter-based enhancer trap system thus enhanced the chance of intense transgene expression, which could be important for applications based on relatively weak photosensitizers, such as mem-kr. finally, the dose of illumination must be optimized for each transgenic line/tissue to elicit the kr-mediated photodamage at the desired level.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the kr-expressing transgenic lines represent useful tools to study the effects of ros-mediated injury in different living cell lineages, in a dose-dependent manner. notably, the decreased cardiac output and subsequent pericardial edema that was induced by kr-mediated ros production in the heart generated a phenotype that closely mimics the pathological condition associated with heart failure in humans. there is accumulating evidence to support a role for ros in the development and progression of heart failure. hence, kr transgenics may find their application in re-constructing the multistage processes caused by oxidative stress-induced damage in development and disease.
