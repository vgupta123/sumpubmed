BACKGROUND
individuals whose immune activity has been compromised by conditions, such as cancer, transplantation, blood dialysis, and aging often become infected with staphylococcus aureus. particularly problematic is infection by methicillin-resistant s. aureus , for which antibiotic chemotherapy is often difficult and results in failure because this organism shows resistance to structurally and functionally diverse chemotherapeutic agents. spread of mrsa was limited to hospital patients for a long period of time, but it has become more common in the broader community in recent years. owing to the multi-antibiotic-resistant nature of mrsa, only a limited range of chemotherapeutic agents can be used; most commonly, vancomycin or the recently developed linezolid  <cit> .

vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic with a molecular mass of  <dig> . it binds with the d-ala-d-ala terminals of the peptidoglycan structure and its precursors, and blocks the action of peptidoglycan transpeptidase or penicillin-binding proteins , consequently inhibiting extension of the peptidoglycan network and growth of the cells  <cit> . vancomycin is active against gram-positive bacteria including enterococci and staphylococci  <cit> , whereas it is ineffective against gram-negative bacteria, mainly because the outer membrane acts as a penetration barrier.

another problem in mrsa-infected patients is co-infection with gram-negative bacteria, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is naturally resistant to vancomycin and linezolid. one of the solutions for the chemotherapy of such mixed infections has been to use a combination of vancomycin and ß-lactam antibiotics  <cit> . in fact, this regime has been recommended for several decades in japan and seems to be successful  <cit> . however, the use of this combination therapy has led to the emergence of mrsa that is resistant to vancomycin only in the presence of ß-lactam antibiotics, which is designated as bivr  <cit> .

bivr is understood to have arisen because the use of ß-lactam antibiotics promotes peptidoglycan metabolism, probably due to partial ß-lactam-mediated damage of the peptidoglycan networks  <cit> . the affected cells upregulate the peptidoglycan biosynthetic pathways and repair systems, producing large amounts of peptidoglycan precursors, such as lipid-intermediate ii with free d-ala-d-ala terminals  <cit> . vancomycin tightly binds with the d-ala-d-ala structure of peptidoglycan and its intermediate precursors  <cit> . consequently, the concentration of free vancomycin in milieu is lowered below its mic and the cells begin to grow under such conditions  <cit> .

the enzyme, ß-lactamase hydrolyses the ß-lactam ring of ß-lactam antibiotics and inactivates them, thereby rendering the cells resistant to ß-lactam antibiotics. staphylococcus cells that have not been exposed to ß-lactam antibiotics do not possess the ß-lactamase gene, blaz, and hence, are highly susceptible to ß-lactam antibiotics. however, clinical use of ß-lactam antibiotics enables the cells to harbour a plasmid bearing blaz that encodes cell-associated penicillinase. these cells have two main emergency responses: one is to induce ß-lactamase and the other is to elicit the peptidoglycan recycling and repair system  <cit> .

we generally assume that most mrsa cells are resistant to ß-lactam antibiotics owing mainly to the production of ß-lactamase  <cit>  or of pbp2′   <cit> . therefore, ß-lactam antibiotics in mrsa culture are readily hydrolysed. however, the bivr phenomenon is induced only in the presence of ß-lactam antibiotics, suggesting that ß-lactam antibiotics in culture remain intact. an empirical observation is that clinical isolates of bivr cells seem to have a low level of ß-lactamase activity compared with that of non-bivr mrsa. accordingly, we hypothesised that ß-lactamase activity in bivr cells was somehow downregulated, which prompted us to investigate the relationship between the bivr phenomenon and ß-lactamase activity.

RESULTS
properties of the representative laboratory bivr and non-bivr cells
bivr is a class of mrsa that is susceptible to vancomycin at ≤2 μg/ml, and becomes vancomycin-resistant in the presence of ß-lactam antibiotics. we tested our stock strains used in this study for the bivr phenomenon. strains mu <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig> were streaked on mu <dig> agar plates impregnated with 4 μg/ml vancomycin. none of these strains grew on the plates, confirming that the bivr cells were vancomycin-susceptible. the mics of vancomycin for these strains were 1–2 μg/ml . when ß-lactam impregnated disks with concentrations of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and 10 μg/ml ceftizoxime  were placed on the plates, all the strains grew around the disks . thus, the bivr property in the laboratory stock strains was confirmed.

cells classified as non-bivr mrsa, which were the k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig> k <dig>  k <dig> and n <dig> strains, were tested similarly. these cells were vancomycin-susceptible and did not grow on the vancomycin-containing plates in the presence or absence of ß-lactam-impregnated disks . the mics of vancomycin for these strains were  <dig> –2 μg/ml.

ß-lactamase activity in bivr and non-bivr cells
based on our hypothesis that bivr cells might express a low level of ß-lactamase, we compared the enzyme activity in five laboratory stock non-bivr and bivr strains. the ß-lactamase activity in non-bivr strains ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  u  with an average value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  u, while that in all five bivr strains showed an undetectable level of ß-lactamase, <10– <dig> u. thus, it became evident that ß-lactamase activity in bivr cells was at least three orders of magnitude lower than that in non-bivr cells. the following explanations are offered:  the non-bivr cells harboured a plasmid bearing the ß-lactamase gene , but the bivr cells did not; or  both bivr and non-bivr cells harboured a blaz-bearing plasmid, but the production of active ß-lactamase in bivr cells was suppressed or downregulated.

to test for the presence of the ß-lactamase gene, blaz was amplified by pcr using a primer set k shown in table  <dig>  n <dig> and fda209p cells were used as positive and negative references, respectively. as seen in figure  <dig>  the pcr products amplified from n <dig> cells showed a large distinct band with nucleotide numbers corresponding to about 170 bp, which was the expected pcr product. the pcr product was undetectable when the fda209p dna was used as a template. similarly, pcr was carried out using the template dna from mu <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig> cells and no detectable band was found . the results suggested that these bivr strains did not have the ß-lactamase gene, which was fully consistent with the finding of undetectable ß-lactamase activity. in contrast, pcr experiments using the dna template from non-bivr strains showed clear bands corresponding to the expected blaz product. these results were again consistent with that of the ß-lactamase assay and with the above explanation ; whether or not bivr cells possessed the gene encoding ß-lactamase, but did not give the answer to the above question ; whether the expression of the ß-lactamase gene in bivr could be suppressed. therefore, the following experiments were conducted.

transformation of bivr cells with a plasmid bearing the ß-lactamase gene
to test whether the ß-lactamase gene was stable in the bivr cells and expressed active enzyme, the bivr cells were transformed with the plasmid carrying blaz. plasmid dna was extracted from n <dig> cells  cultured in  <dig>  ml brain–heart infusion broth and purified by the plasmid mini kit . the average yield of dna appeared to be ~50 ng. to confirm that the extracts contained the plasmid bearing the ß-lactamase gene, they were subjected to pcr amplification using the primer set k. agarose gel electrophoresis clearly showed a single distinct large band corresponding to the size of the expected pcr product . attempts have been made to extract the plasmid dna from bivr cells, such as k <dig> and five other strains, but the yield was consistently undetectable except for the k <dig> cells, which showed a trace amount of dna. pcr amplification of blaz taking the k <dig> extracts as the template yielded no visible band.

the bivr cells, k <dig> and k <dig>  were transformed with plasmid dna extracted from n <dig> cells. selection of the transformants for ß-lactam resistance was difficult because the recipient cells were ß-lactam-resistant beforehand to a certain extent. thus, transformants were selected on agar plates impregnated with a  <dig> -fold mic equivalent of ampicillin and obtained from k <dig> and k <dig> strains . presence of the blaz gene in the k744-t and k2480-t cells was confirmed by pcr using whole-cell extracts as the template, and subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis yielded a single dna band corresponding to that obtained from n <dig> cells . note that the amount of pcr products using k744-t and k2480-t dna as the template appeared low compared with that from n <dig> cells . the identity of untransformed and transformed cells was confirmed by pulse-field gel electrophoresis of the chromosomal dna treated with smai. unsuccessful attempts were made to transform fda209p with the pn <dig> plasmid. the reasons for failure of this transformation experiment remain obscure.

ß-lactamase activity was determined using n <dig>  k744-t and k2480-t cells. the results showed that activity in n <dig> cells appeared to be  <dig>  u, while the levels in k744-t and k2480-t cells were undetectable . plasmid dna from k744-t was undetectable, but a trace amount was extracted from k2480-t comparable with the level from the untransformed parent cells. attempts have been made to amplify the blaz dna using the column eluate of the extracts as the template. the pcr product using the k744-t extracts was undetectable and that of k2480-t showed a faint band, which was identical with the control experiment using untransformed k <dig>  we interpreted these results to mean that the bivr cells might have a mechanism to modify the ß-lactamase gene. the transformants were subjected to the bivr test. k744-t and k2480-t cells showed a strong bivr reaction in the presence of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and 10 μg/ml ceftizoxime , confirming that the bivr property was unchanged even in the presence of modified blaz.

search for mutations in the blaz gene of the transformants
one of the possibilities for low ß-lactamase activity in the bivr transformants could be that the ß-lactamase gene could have mutations or is somehow modified. experiments were carried out to amplify and sequence blaz using  <dig> different pairs of primers  covering the entire blaz sequence. as k744-t dna or k2480-t dna was used as a template, the yield of pcr product was consistently low in all the experiments . however, attempts were made to determine their nucleotide sequences comparing with the sequence from pn <dig> . nucleotide sequencing of the pcr products from the k744-t template showed  <dig> amino acid substitutions at val9ala, ser22pro, val86ile, glu145gly, lys193glu, asn196lys, phe203leu, asn207ser, pro217ser and tyr220cys compared with the blaz sequence on pn <dig> . nucleotide sequencing of the products using the k2480-t templates could not be completed owing to the poor yield of pcr products . therefore, it is not clear whether or not blaz in k2840-t had mutations. however, it was strongly suggested that blaz in k2480-t was modified because the amount of pcr product was consistently low or undetectable in some cases using  <dig> different pairs of primers, compared with the amount of pcr product from n <dig> cells .

taken together, these findings indicated that introduction of the blaz gene into bivr cells did not elevate the ß-lactamase activity nor had much influence on the bivr property, which might have been due to modification of the blaz gene in the transformants. therefore, these findings support the prediction that the ß-lactamase gene was downregulated or modified in bivr cells.

ß-lactamase activity and occurrence of the blaz gene in clinical isolates of bivr and non-bivr mrsa
the above results were obtained using laboratory stock strains. to determine whether a similar tendency would be seen in fresh clinical isolates, we collected a total of  <dig> strains of independently isolated mrsa from  <dig> regionally distant hospitals. twenty-five strains were classified as bivr, which was equivalent to  <dig> % of the total, while  <dig> strains  were non-bivr. all these strains were subjected to the blaz test by pcr and a qualitative ß-lactamase test using a nitrocefin-impregnated disk. among the  <dig> bivr strains,  <dig>  were blaz-negative and  <dig>  yielded negative results for the nitrocefin test . among the non-bivr strains,  <dig>  were blaz-positive and only  <dig>  were blaz-negative. similarly,  <dig> strains  yielded positive results for the nitrocefin test and the remaining  <dig>  gave negative results . a statistically significant difference in the occurrence of the blaz gene and ß-lactamase activity between the bivr and non-bivr strains was found with a probability < <dig>  by the χ <dig> and fisher’s tests. these results clearly showed a trend for bivr cells to lack the ß-lactamase gene and not produce active ß-lactamase, whereas most non-bivr cells possessed the blaz gene and a significant fraction  produced ß-lactamase. it should be noted that the nitrocefin test is a qualitative assay and might not be sensitive enough to detect low levels of ß-lactamase. to investigate this possibility, we randomly selected  <dig> non-bivr strains that were blaz-positive and -negative for the nitrocefin test and carried out a quantitative ß-lactamase assay. all cells produced a low level of ß-lactamase ranging from  <dig> ×10– <dig> to  <dig> ×10– <dig> u with an average of  <dig> ×10–3 ±  <dig> ×10– <dig> u . therefore, the number of ß-lactamase-positive strains must be much higher.

bivr
ten randomly selected non-bivr strains that were blaz-positive and positive for the nitrocefin test were subjected to the quantitative ß-lactamase assay. the activity ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> ×10– <dig> u with an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  u. thus, it is likely that most non-bivr cells produced ß-lactamase. activity in bivr cells  was undetectable.

discussion
this paper addressed the question of whether bivr cells possess the blaz gene and produce active ß-lactamase because bivr cells show resistance to vancomycin only in the presence of ß-lactam antibiotics. this means that ß-lactam antibiotics must remain active in the bivr milieu. tests using laboratory stock strains revealed that all bivr cells lacked blaz and showed an undetectable level of ß-lactamase activity. all the laboratory stock non-bivr cells possessed blaz and produced high levels of ß-lactamase. this trend was confirmed using  <dig> clinical isolates including  <dig> bivr and  <dig> non-bivr strains. transformation of the bivr cells with a plasmid bearing blaz revealed that:  ß-lactamase activity was undetectable;  an attempt to extract the plasmid bearing blaz was unsuccessful;  pcr amplification of blaz yielded a very low level of products in all  <dig> experiments using  <dig> different primer sets; and  the nucleotide sequence of the pcr products using the k744-t template revealed  <dig> amino acid substitutions.

a plausible explanation of the results is that a low or undetectable level of ß-lactamase in bivr cells enables ß-lactam antibiotics to remain active, thereby promoting peptidoglycan metabolism and the repair system producing large amounts of peptidoglycan precursors with unbound d-ala-d-ala terminals  <cit> . the precursors bind with free vancomycin, lowering the vancomycin concentration in milieu below the mic of vancomycin. the bivr cells begin to grow under these conditions, resulting in vancomycin resistance.

in the presence of ß-lactam antibiotics, a bacterial cell probably detects the peptidoglycan fragments generated by the ß-lactam action and might respond by producing ß-lactamase or promoting the peptidoglycan biosynthetic cascade and repair system  <cit> . switching from one response to the other is assumed to be regulated by the balance of two peptidoglycan intermediates, such as anhmurnac-tripeptide and udp-murnac-pentapeptide; a scenario reported in escherichia coli <cit> .

if this scenario is applicable to s. aureus cells, bivr and non-bivr may be explained as follows. in the presence of ß-lactam antibiotics, mrsa cells, which have cryptic mutations to promote peptidoglycan metabolism, produce large amounts of peptidoglycan intermediates and deplete free vancomycin. s. aureus responding in this way may be bivr. in contrast, in the presence of ß-lactam antibiotics, mrsa cells with a wild-type level of peptidoglycan metabolism undergo activation of the ß-lactamase-producing pathway. they may be the vancomycin-susceptible non-bivr mrsa. however, this interpretation does not explain the discovery reported in this study that bivr cells tend to exclude the plasmid bearing the ß-lactamase gene, and downregulate the production of active ß-lactamase, probably modifying the blaz gene. these observations may be accounted for by suggesting that bivr cells exclude blaz or do not produce active ß-lactamase to maintain intact ß-lactam antibiotics in milieu to promote peptidoglycan metabolism. if ß-lactam antibiotics are hydrolyzed by the ß-lactamase, upregulated peptidoglycan metabolism would cease and the cell would be killed immediately by vancomycin.

to find a solution for the treatment of bivr infection, we conducted serial passage experiments of bivr cells in an antibiotic-free medium for several consecutive days and tested the fate of the bivr cells. figure  <dig> shows the bivr test of the cells subjected for serial passage in the antibiotic-free medium. for the sake of space, only one strain each of the laboratory stock bivr  and freshly isolated clinical bivr  was presented. the bivr cell properties were phased out by  <dig> consecutive days of passages. these cells, whose bivr properties were gradually phased out, showed the non-bivr phenotype when subjected to the bivr test again. the mechanism of phasing out was not investigated further. the lesson from this experiment is that, once bivr cells are isolated from patients, the use of ß-lactam antibiotics should be terminated for a while until the bivr cells are phased out, and another type of antibiotic effective against gram-negative bacteria should be used.

CONCLUSIONS
a class of s. aureus, which shows vancomycin resistance only in the presence of ß-lactam antibiotics , was tested for the presence of the ß-lactamase gene  by pcr, and for the production of active ß-lactamase. the rationale for this study was that ß-lactam antibiotics in bivr culture must be preserved to induce vancomycin resistance. however, it is generally assumed that the majority of mrsa strains harbour a plasmid bearing blaz and produce active ß-lactamase. five randomly selected laboratory stock bivr strains showed no trace of either blaz or ß-lactamase activity, whereas five non-bivr laboratory strains possessed blaz, and produced ß-lactamase at an average level of  <dig>  u. among  <dig> strains of freshly isolated mrsa,  <dig> and  <dig> were bivr and non-bivr, respectively. of the  <dig> bivr strains, only four  and two  strains were blaz-positive and yielded a positive result for the ß-lactamase test, respectively. among the non-bivr strains,  <dig>  and > <dig>  were blaz-positive and yielded a positive result for the ß-lactamase test. transformation of bivr cells with a plasmid bearing blaz still showed an undetectable level of ß-lactamase activity that probably was due to modification of the transformed blaz gene. these results clearly demonstrate that the majority of bivr cells do not produce active ß-lactamase either by avoiding harbouring of the blaz gene or by modification of blaz that preserves ß-lactam antibiotics in the bivr milieu and induces vancomycin resistance.
