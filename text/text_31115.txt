BACKGROUND
peptic ulcer disease  is a common condition as contributes to morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide. the annual prevalence of pud is  <dig> - <dig> %  <cit> . aetiology of pud is multi-factorial  <cit> . high acid secretion and decreased mucosal barrier contribute to initiation and progression of pud  <cit> . the aetiology is ranging from helicobacter pylori  infection to stress, lifestyle characteristics and drugs  <cit> . one of the most important drugs that contribute to pud is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs   <cit> . consumption of nsaids is shown to be related to increased mucosal injury, erosions and gastric and duodenal bleeding. this effect is mainly due to the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase  <dig>  resulting in reduced mucosal defence as well as thromboxane a <dig> which regulates platelet aggregation and therefore results in gastric bleeding  <cit> . another mechanism that is well described in nsaids induced gastric injury is the production of reactive oxygen species   <cit> . in literatures, several authors had been reported the use of synthesized compound for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders including gastric ulcerogenic damage  <cit> .

the main goals of pud treatment, is firstly to reduce acid secretion, the hallmark of these medications is the proton pomp inhibitor , and secondly to improve mucosal barrier, including sucralfate and bismuth salts   <cit> . it is also believed that scavenging free radicals will also prevent the production of pud  <cit> . after discovery of h-pylori, eradication of this bacterial infection became one of the essential steps in treatment of pud  <cit> . herbal medication and natural substances were long used for the treatment and management of pud. different herbs and spices have been introduced, in traditional medicines, as treatments for pud. plant derived medications have long been considered as safe and effective agents against pud  <cit> .

flavonoids are one of the most abundant compartments in the vegetarian kingdom. flavonoids are found in any part of plants including leaves, stalks, roots, fruits and seeds and are proven to have different effects on the gastrointestinal tract. they are also shown to be effective in prevention and treatment of pud  <cit> . chalcones are the precursors of flavonoids in plants. most chalcones contain a six-member heterocyclic ring and are considered the first product of flavonoid synthesis pathway  <cit> . various chalcones have been identified in nature and synthesized in laboratories and were shown to have variety of effects including prevention of peptic ulcer and oxidative stress as well as antibiotic, antifungal and anti-inflammatory effects  <cit> . among the variety of chalcones  <dig> chalcones were shown to have antiulcer effects due to increased gastric blood flow and stimulating mucosal secretion. to the best of our knowledge no study was performed on the protective effect of chalcone against ulcers induced by nsaid prescription as well as the antioxidant properties of this chalcone in nsaid induced gastric injury.

the aim of this study was to identify the effects of chalcone -3-m-tolyl-propenone)  on nsaid induced erosive gastic damage in sprague dawley rats.

RESULTS
acute toxicity
a single oral administration of -3-m-tolyl-propenone)  chalcone at three doses  did not result any mortality for 24 hours and no toxic effects and abnormal behaviour  were observed throughout 14 days. the biochemical measurement of blood serum, clinical observation and histo-pathological estimation of the kidney and liver revealed that there are no significant differences  between treated groups and normal control group as shown in , .table  <dig>

antiulcer characteristics
the gastro-protective effects of hptp chalcone was estimated against indomethacin induced gastric ulcer in rats  in terms of ph of gastric, mucus barrier, erosive gastric damage area and percentage of inhibition. pre-treatment with 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg of hptp were found to inhibit stomach lining injury induced by indomethacin. this inhibition appeared in low dose and high dose  respectively. thus, this study revealed that hptp can decrease the acidity significantly  which plays a major role in stimulating stomach ulcer. gastric mucus layer that is covering the gastric lining plays an important role in preserving the inner layer of stomach from exogenous aggressive factors. in this study it has been shown that hptp significantly enhanced the gastric mucus production at low dose and high dose administration .table  <dig>

discussion
chalcones are widely found in the plants and produce antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticancer and antibiotic properties. their availability in different plant sources as well as their pharmacological values and low toxicity resulted in the interest of scientists and industries  <cit> . this study was performed with the aim of evaluating antiulcer effects of tested chalcone in rats. the results of this study revealed that all doses  of -3-m-tolyl-propenone)  chalcone are safe because none of the animals produced toxic signs and symptoms and none died during the study period. moreover there are no significant differences in biochemical parameters of liver and kidney. histology revealed no nephrotoxic or hepatotoxic effect. similarly, several researcher used various synthesized schiff base compound and showed no nephrotoxicity or hepatotoxicity and the biochemical parameter are within the normal rang  <cit> . based on these findings the doses of chalcone used for the antiulcer experiment was of no toxicity to rats. moreover, this study showed that chalcone was able to produce more ulcer inhibition in gastric tissue in rats  chain process  <cit> . odabasoglu et al.  also reported that indomethacin administration resulted in significant reduction in sod levels in rats. this was in line with findings of this study that revealed a significant decrease in sod levels in rats with indomethacin induced gastric ulcer. this study also revealed that administration of chalcone is capable of increasing the sod levels and therefore play a preventive role against indomethacin-induced gastric ulcerogenic damage. koizumi et al.  <cit>  showed that the administration of 30 mg/kg indomethacin resulted in a significant reduction in the pge <dig> levels in rats. this finding was also in line with the findings of this study. this study revealed that the most important oxidative mechanisms of indomethacin induced erosive gastric damage is related to reduction of the important antioxidants in the stomach including sod as well as pge <dig>  in the present study, the findings from histology tests showed the multiple potential effect of chalcone through reduction in acidity and inhibition percentage, while in the same time mucus barrier was increased, which resulted in smaller gastric ulcer area in chalcone groups . these properties were also found to be dose dependent as they improved gastric mucosal state by increasing dosage. furthermore, this study revealed that administration of chalcone at low and high dose  reduced ulcers in stomach. these findings were in line with the previous findings in terms of protective mechanisms of chalcone and flavonoids  <cit> . the findings of this study suggest the use of chalcone with nsaids to reduce the risk of pud. also in a study by okunrobo and colleagues  <cit>  they tested the anti-inflammatory and gastro-protective properties of a synthetic chalcone with different dosages on rats who compared with the acetylsalicylic acid  and cimetidine  rat groups. the results were similar with the results present study terms of gastric wall mucosal characteristics  and acidity of gastric content. finally omeprazole was used as antiulcer reference chemicals in this study against induced ulcer by indomethacin. omeprazole as a proton pump inhibitors  are broadly prescribed medications with the control of gastric acid secretion for the prevention or treatment of peptic ulcer  <cit> . omeprazole can suppress the gastric acid secretion through the h+,k + −atpase  <cit> . it has been discovered that the h+,k + −atpase as gastric cell proton pump transfers h+ in exchange for luminal k+ to generate a highly acidic environment in the stomach that is responsible for gastric acid secretion  <cit> . lastly indomethacin as a potent inhibitor of prostaglandins synthesis diminishes the protective effect of pge <dig> on mucosa of gastric wall  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
acute toxicity tests did not show any sign of morbidity or mortality up to 1000 mg/kg of hptp. rats pre-treated with 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg of hptp before administration of 100 mg/kg of indomethacin significantly protect erosive gastric mucosal damage compared to ulcerogenic control group. histologic findings showed that hptp remarkably protect gastric mucosa compared to ulcerogenic control group. the gastroprotective effects of hptp could be attributed to increase in ph and mucus content of gastric content, increase endogenous enzymes and pge <dig>  and decrease in mda level in gastric homogenate, over-expresion of hsp <dig> and tgf-β proteins, and down-expression of bax protein.
