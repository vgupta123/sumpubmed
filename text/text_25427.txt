BACKGROUND
enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli , the intersection of shiga toxin producing e. coli  and attaching and effacing e. coli , comprise a group of pathogenic e. coli that cause a variety of human and animal illnesses ranging from diarrhea to hemorrhagic colitis , and the multifactorial hemolytic uremic syndrome   <cit> . intimate adherence to the intestinal epithelium resulting in characteristic attaching and effacing  lesions, and the destruction of capillary walls via production of phage borne shiga toxins  are hallmarks of ehec pathogenesis. a/e lesion formation is dependent upon a type three secretion system , which is encoded on the laterally acquired locus of enterocyte effacement   <cit> .

e. coli o157:h <dig> is the dominant ehec serotype in the united states, argentina, great britain, and japan  <cit> . however, multiple reports have shown that other ehec, including serogroups o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig>  frequently cause sporadic cases of human illness  <cit> , and have been implicated in numerous outbreaks  <cit> . in australia and parts of europe, infections with serogroups o <dig> and o <dig> are prevailing while the incidence of o157:h7-associated disease appears to be declining  <cit> . in contrast to e. coli o157:h <dig>  ehec serogroups o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  and o <dig> are commonly linked to outbreaks and sporadic cases of calf diarrhea  and hc  <cit> , which has been validated from experimental infections in calves  <cit> . in germany and belgium, for example, ehec o <dig> is the most prevalent type of stec associated with diarrhea in calves  <cit> , with evidence for zoonotic transmission  <cit> .

phylogenetic analyses of conserved metabolic genes have revealed some of the basis for the variation among ehec strains. multilocus enzyme electrophoresis  <cit>  and partial sequencing of  <dig> housekeeping genes  <cit>  classified ehec into two distantly related clonal groups: ehec  <dig> includes serotype o157:h <dig> and its inferred ancestor o55:h <dig>  whereas ehec  <dig> includes numerous serogroups . the key virulence factors shared between ehec  <dig> and ehec  <dig> clonal complexes were postulated to have been introduced through multiple and parallel acquisitions of mobile elements  <cit> . a comparison of e. coli o157:h <dig> genomes has also revealed the extent and significant impact of horizontal transfer on the evolution of virulence  <cit> . furthermore, array comparative genomic hybridizations  have shown that the divergence in gene content among closely related o <dig> strains is ~ <dig> times greater than the divergence at the nucleotide sequence level  <cit> . although recent evidence indicates the emergence of highly virulent lineages among non-o <dig> ehec, notably the o <dig> serogroup  <cit> , little is known about the gene content, genetic diversity and evolution of virulence in members of the ehec  <dig> group.

the function of ancillary virulence determinants is somewhat characterized in o157:h <dig>  <cit> , however, the relevance as well as the distribution of these factors in ehec  <dig> is not clear. to systematically investigate the gene content variations within the ehec  <dig> clonal group. we analyzed a set of  <dig> clinical ehec  <dig> strains representing serotypes o26:h <dig>  o111:h8/h <dig>  o118:h <dig>  o153:h <dig> and o15:h <dig> from humans and animals using array-based cgh. because there are no ehec  <dig> genome sequences available, a multi-genome spotted oligoarray containing probes for  <dig>  orfs from o157:h <dig> sakai, o157:h <dig> edl <dig>  and k- <dig> mg <dig> was used to examine the distribution of these e. coli genes in our collection of ehec  <dig> strains. the findings of this study shed light on the diversification of horizontally acquired elements in a group of pathogens that represent recent evolutionary branches of ehec clonal groups.

RESULTS
sequence types  and stx profiles of ehec  <dig> strains
phylogenetic analyses of multi locus sequence typing  data grouped the  <dig> ehec  <dig> strains  into four sts. the most common was st  <dig>  which was found in  <dig> strains, while the remaining three sts each differed from st  <dig> by a single nucleotide polymorphism  in almost  <dig>  bp of the concatenated mlst sequence. mlst data revealed a lack of nucleotide sequence diversity in house keeping genes among these ehec  <dig> strains. the neighbor-joining phylogeny based on concatenated mlst allelic sequences grouped the ehec  <dig> strains into a distinct cluster, with 100% bootstrap support, which was more closely related to the epec  <dig> group  than to members of ehec  <dig> . most of these ehec  <dig> strains  were pcr positive for only stx <dig>  whereas four strains had both stx <dig> and stx <dig>  and three strains were negative for both stx genes .

gene content of ehec  <dig> strains
binary classification of genes as present or divergent/absent, inferred by gack analyses of the cgh data, was used to determine the gene content of all  <dig> ehec  <dig> strains  and of each individual strain . because all cgh experiments were performed with sakai as the reference strain, our analyses focused on probes targeting genes present in the sakai genome. the oligo probes were classified to represent backbone genes , and sakai-specific genes . the sakai-specific genes were further classified in sakai phage genes  and sakai bacterial genes   <cit> . of the  <dig>  backbone genes,  <dig> % were shared by all ehec  <dig> strains, whereas only  <dig> % of the sakai phage genes  and  <dig> % of the sakai bacterial genes  were found in every tested ehec  <dig> strain. while  <dig> % of the sakai phage genes were found in at least one of the  <dig> ehec  <dig> strains, a whole 53% of the sakai bacterial genes were not found in any of the these strains .

a – genes that were detected in at least one of the  <dig> ehec  <dig> strains, but not in all ehec  <dig> strains.

a – stan. dev., standard deviation.

in each individual ehec  <dig> strain, approximately 95% of the  <dig>  backbone genes were found , with little variation . in contrast, about 52% of the sakai phage genes were found, but with a much greater variability across ehec  <dig> strains . this may be an over estimation of sakai phage gene distribution in ehec  <dig>  as  <dig> of the  <dig> phage gene probes analyzed had multiple phage gene targets in the sakai genome, based on in silico analysis of probe specificity. sakai bacterial genes were found less frequently in ehec  <dig> strains . serotype o26:h <dig> showed the most interstrain variation, whereas o111:h <dig> and o118:h <dig> were more uniform with respect to sakai gene distribution. the o55:h <dig> representative also had a high percentage of backbone genes . furthermore, 33% of the  <dig> sakai phage genes and 70% of the  <dig> sakai bacterial genes were conserved in o55:h <dig>  suggesting an inverse trend relative to that observed in ehec  <dig> strains .

identification of potential ehec-specific genes
from the  <dig>  sakai-specific genes represented on the microarray,  <dig>  were conserved in  <dig> of the  <dig> ehec  <dig> strains;  <dig> of these were phage-related. sixty-four genes encode hypothetical proteins of unknown function, and the remainder consisted mostly of genes responsible for various prophage and other mobile element functions. nucleotide sequences of these  <dig> genes were compared against five non-ehec pathogenic e. coli  and six shigella  published genomes, using blast. with a minimum of 80% nucleotide sequence identity in a minimum of 80% query coverage as the cutoff value to identify conserved genes,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes were not found in any of the  <dig> queried non-ehec genome sequences. the  <dig> gene sequences were then "blasted" against the entire genbank database with the same cutoff value. only three of these  <dig> genes were not found in any other organisms and therefore could be considered as specific to ehec strains: ecs <dig>  6); ecs <dig>  and ecs <dig> . all three genes encode hypothetical proteins of unknown function.

genomic relatedness of ehec  <dig> strains
we used the split decomposition method to infer the strain relatedness based on gene content data. we first analyzed all the  <dig>  genes whose probe intensities were higher than those for negative controls. as expected, the analysis showed a network like phylogeny , in which the parallel edges reflected incompatible signals in the data that were indicative of parallel gene gain/loss due to multiple transduction events or past recombination. all o111:h <dig> strains were clustered closely and branched away from the remaining ehec  <dig> strains, which formed a loose cluster without any recognizable concordance to serotypes, hosts, or locations . the pairwise homoplasy index   <cit> , generated in splitstree, confirmed that there was significant evidence of recombination .

among the  <dig>  genes whose probe intensities were higher than those for negative controls,  <dig> % were found to be either present or divergent/absent in all  <dig> strains, and therefore, phylogenetically uninformative. compatibility analysis of the  <dig> parsimoniously informative  genes identified  <dig> pi genes to be phylogenetically compatible with each other, but not compatible with the rest of the pi genes . for the second split decomposition analysis, these  <dig> genes were combined with  <dig> singleton genes . singletons were added to generate terminal edges of the network and to help distinguish strain-specific changes. the analysis with this set of genes showed a more tree like phylogeny with a better separation of ehec  <dig> strains . six o111:h <dig> strains and six o118:h <dig> strains formed two tight and distinct clusters, while the twelve o26:h <dig>  o111:h <dig>  o153:h <dig>  and o15:h <dig> strains were dispersed throughout the network. the o111:h <dig> cluster was visibly distinct from the rest, reiterating its particular pattern of gene content conservation across all  <dig>  genes . the two o111:h <dig> strains did not cluster with o111:h <dig> strains, which is not unusual since the o <dig> serogroup has been suggested to include several lineages  <cit> . in this analysis, the o118:h <dig> strains appear to be more closely related to most of the o26:h <dig> strains than any other ehec  <dig> serotype. nonetheless, there was a short edge separating the o118:h <dig> serotype from o26:h <dig>  followed by strain-specific splits within o118:h <dig> that were based on singleton genes. the eight o26:h <dig> strains did not cluster together, suggesting that strains of this serotype are considerably more diverse than o111:h <dig> and o118:h <dig> strains.

prophages
to visualize gene content of the  <dig> sakai phage genes within the ehec  <dig> clonal group, we classified these genes by sakai phage groups  and sorted the genes in each group by chromosomal order . this classification does not necessarily infer that these genes are present in ehec  <dig> within the same phage or order as they are in sakai, but simply allows an assessment of gene content variation of laterally acquired genes known to be linked in the sakai chromosome. dendrograms based on pairwise comparison of gene content were used to identify ehec  <dig> strains with similar gene content . overall, there was no common pattern of gene distribution for all phage groups , which was also implied by additional split decomposition networks . some similarity was detected among o111:h <dig> strains for sp <dig>  sp <dig> and sp <dig> genes, with more sp <dig> and sp <dig> genes being conserved in the o111:h <dig> serotype than in other ehec  <dig> strains. conversely, sp <dig> was well-conserved in all but the o111:h <dig> strains , in which sp <dig> genes were virtually absent except for two short gene segments, ecs1638– <dig> and ecs1656– <dig>  which encode tail and hypothetical proteins, respectively.

stx converting prophages
the cgh data confirmed the stx1/stx <dig> profile of the ehec  <dig> strains determined by pcr. in sp <dig> , a block of genes at the beginning of the phage  was conserved in most strains . these genes encode tail proteins and the putative outer membrane protein lom precursor . adjacent is a group of genes  encoding two tail proteins, a putative terminase large subunit and several unknown proteins, which are fully conserved in o111:h <dig> strains but almost completely divergent/absent in the rest. two regions in the sp <dig> phage, ecs2984– <dig> and ecs2998– <dig>  were well conserved in all strains positive for the stx <dig> gene, except in o111:h <dig> strains. excisionase and integrase genes  were divergent/absent in most of the ehec  <dig> strains. overall, the gene content of sp <dig> in strains negative for the stx <dig> gene was different from those in stx <dig> positive strains .

strains positive for the stx <dig> gene, mostly representing serotype o111:h <dig>  had more sp <dig>  genes. integrase and excisionase genes , and the block of genes at the beginning of the phage, ecs1160– <dig>  were missing from most strains. the rest of sp <dig> genes, which encode replication proteins o and p, nine and ning, shiga toxin  <dig>  antirepressor proteins, antitermination protein q, outer membrane precursor proteins, terminases, tail proteins, and a number of hypothetical proteins, were present in five of the six o111:h <dig> strains as well as in the o26:h <dig> strain containing both stx <dig> and stx <dig> .

locus of enterocyte effacement  island
of the  <dig> genes in the sakai lee island that are located on sple <dig>  all except escu were present in the o55:h <dig> strain. this includes genes that were categorized as present after the initial gack cutoff was relaxed by 20%. since dye-swap genomic microarrays represent competitive hybridizations between two populations of dna, there were instances when a small difference in the nucleotide sequence of the tested strain resulted in weaker probe signal intensity. for example, both of the two known snps present between the variable regions of γ intimin in o55:h <dig> and o157:h <dig>  <cit>  are located in the middle region of the 70-mer probe for eae. hence the signal intensity for this gene was just below the cutoff . based on the level of divergence of ehec  <dig> lee genes from o <dig> lee genes, strains clustered into two major groups . the top group of the dendrogram is composed of human strains, which have a high level of similarity to o <dig> lee genes, whereas the bottom cluster represents  <dig> animal and  <dig> human strains that have a lower level of similarity to the o <dig> lee genes. the level of divergence was also found to be heterogeneous between lee operons . the genes that encode the type iii secretion system , escrstucjvndf, were detected in  <dig> to  <dig> strains, with the exception of escr and escc, which were found in  <dig> and  <dig> strains, respectively. the needle filament gene, espa, was present in  <dig> strains, whereas espb and espd were divergent/absent in all. the tir and γ intimin genes were also divergent/absent in ehec 2; the γ intimin was conserved only in the o55:h <dig> representative, an expected result because the 70-mer probe was designed to detect the variable  part of eae.

other phage gene groups
most genes from sple <dig>  which encodes the tellurite resistance and adherence island , were divergent/absent from two ehec  <dig> strains and from the o55:h <dig> representative, but present in the rest of the ehec  <dig> strains . the diverse trend in retention or loss of laterally acquired genes was emphasized by the arrangement of sp <dig> genes. cgh data inferred three patterns of sp <dig> gene content conservation in ehec  <dig> . in the first  <dig> strains , sp <dig> genes were found to be present or divergent/absent in an en bloc fashion. the middle branch of the dendrogram represents six strains in which virtually all sp <dig> genes were present. in the remaining five strains, sp <dig> genes appeared to have a mosaic structure with individual genes present or divergent/absent. in contrast, sp <dig> was either entirely divergent/absent or nearly completely present. there was no correlation between the distribution of sakai phage genes in ehec  <dig> and geographic location of the ehec  <dig> isolates.

non-lee encoded effectors
the gene content of non-lee encoded effectors, which are predicted to be secreted by the lee-encoded ttss  <cit>  in ehec  <dig>  varied from totally divergent/absent to present in every strain . genes espy <dig>  nled, espx <dig>  espy <dig>  espl3', espx3', espl <dig>  and nleb2- <dig> were divergent/absent from ehec  <dig>  whereas a set of  <dig> genes  were present in at least  <dig> ehec  <dig> strains. the nleg <dig> gene, which was recently found to be conserved in a group of non-o <dig> ehec strains  <cit> , was also divergent/absent in all ehec  <dig> examined in this study.

discussion
comparative analysis of genomes from  <dig> commensal and pathogenic e. coli strains has revealed a diverse species 'pan-genome', while the e. coli 'core conserved' genome was calculated to be about one-half of the genome of a given e. coli isolate  <cit> . although ehec utilize similar virulence mechanisms, this pathotype is comprised of phylogenetically distinct lineages that vary in their ability to cause disease in both humans and animals. clearly, the genome of a single strain cannot reflect how the genomic diversity among ehec strains influences pathogenesis of the ehec population. because no strains from the ehec  <dig> clonal group have been sequenced, the genetic variability of  <dig> ehec  <dig> strains were examined in relation to the distribution of genes from o157:h <dig> sakai, which belongs to the ehec  <dig> clonal group. the sakai genome was used in this study, as its annotation is suggested to include more strain-specific genes compared to edl <dig>  <cit> . genes specific to the ehec  <dig> group have yet to be described. some genes shared with sakai might have been missed in our study, if the gene sequence had diverged to a point where the 70-mer oligonucleotide probes and the stringency of competitive hybridization preclude detection. although this study allowed screening of known genes only, the gene content data still offered new insight on strain relatedness and the distribution and subsequent diversification of mobile elements within the ehec  <dig> clonal group.

the cgh data presented here indicate that there are two distinct trends, which reflect the bacterial  and phage  origin of genes, impacting the genomic divergence of ehec  <dig>  virtually the entire set of backbone genes was present within the ehec  <dig> clonal group . cgh inferences pertaining to the distribution of backbone genes can vary depending on array type, sample size, and strain diversity  <cit> . for example, anjum et al. have proposed that the o <dig> serogroup exhibits greater genetic homogeneity than was observed in our study  <cit> ; however, the microarray platform used in that study was limited to the genome of k- <dig> mg <dig>  despite these differences, the degree of conservation among backbone genes in this cgh investigation was similar in previous studies  <cit> . the distribution of sakai-specific genes in ehec  <dig> was, not surprisingly, noticeably lower than that of the backbone, which restates established findings about intraspecies genomic variability  <cit> . the conservation of sakai phage genes was, however, found to be more than 2-fold higher when compared to sakai bacterial genes . in o55:h <dig>  the inferred ancestor of o157:h <dig>  <cit> , the proportion of sakai phage to bacterial gene conservation was opposite from the proportion observed in ehec 2; this suggests that sakai bacterial genes have been vertically acquired from the o55:h <dig> progenitor and are not disseminated among the ehec  <dig> clone. cursory assessment of k-12-specific genes suggests a homogenous distribution in ehec  <dig>  with less than half of the genes present; most k- <dig> phage-related genes were found to be uniformly divergent/absent from the entire ehec  <dig> population . assessing the conservation of k- <dig> specific genes was, however, beyond the scope of this study, as k- <dig> mg <dig> is a non-pathogenic laboratory-derived strain that is distantly related to ehec .

the increased presence of sakai phage genes in the ehec  <dig> group compared to sakai bacterial genes reveals independent acquisition and exchange of similar mobile elements. for example, of the  <dig> sakai-specific genes present in ehec  <dig>  only  <dig> genes were not found in  <dig> completed non-ehec e. coli and shigella spp. genomes. about one-half of the  <dig> "ehec only" genes were found in stx1-encoding phages bp- <dig> and cp- <dig> from stec o84:h <dig> and o111:h-, respectively  <cit> . sakai genes identified by blastn as present on bp- <dig> are disseminated on phages sp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which is in agreement with the evidence for recombination between phages  <cit> . although the number of phage genes shared by all tested strains was low, the percentage of those that were vap was high , which may reflect sequence heterogeneity in prophage genomes with similar modular structures  <cit> , and not true absence of genes.

phylogenetic network analysis implied a serotype-specific uniformity of o111:h <dig> strains, unlike other ehec  <dig> strains , which can also be inferred from the arrangement of sakai phage genes in o111:h <dig> strains . interestingly, these six ehec  <dig> representatives are the only strains with the θ intimin allele while the remaining eighteen ehec  <dig> strains had β intimin, as determined by pcr-based rflp typing of eae; the method for eae typing was described previously  <cit> . by contrast, members of the ehec  <dig> clonal group  typically had the γ allele. although intimin θ has been found in an atypical epec o55:h <dig> and a non-ehec  <dig> strain , o111:h <dig> is, to our knowledge, the only ehec  <dig> serotype with this intimin allele, providing further support for the hypothesis that o111:h <dig> represents a distinct grouping.

based on the distinguishing distribution of sakai genes , serotype o26:h <dig> appears to be considerably more diverse compared to the distinct and more uniform o111:h <dig>  this suggests that the genetic make-up of o26:h <dig> is such that it allows more frequent lateral exchange of dna elements, which can result in acquisition of novel fitness and virulence genes by o26:h <dig> more commonly than by other ehec  <dig>  for example, o26:h <dig> possess the yersinia spp. high pathogenicity island  that encodes the iron-uptake siderophore yersiniabactin and the pesticin receptor, whereas other ehec serotypes, including o157:h <dig>  o111:h-, o103:h <dig>  and o145:h-, do not have this hpi  <cit> . the diversity of o26:h11/h- has also been implied with other methods  <cit> .

a proportion of the ehec  <dig> hybridization data  were identified as genes that are phylogenetically compatible with each other, i.e., having no homoplasy. although this represents a small number of genes, it is remarkable that the distribution pattern grouped ehec  <dig> o111:h <dig> and o118:h <dig> strains by serotype . the pathogenic e. coli used in this study represent tips of phylogenetic branches, where high frequencies of recombination strongly impact the shaping of genomic content  <cit>  and eventually lead to erosion of the phylogenetic signal between clonal complexes  <cit> . thus, the set of genes shared with ehec  <dig> o157:h <dig> whose pattern of presence and absence in ehec  <dig> infers compatibility and is not random, but coincides with serotype, warrants further investigation.

the heterogeneity of stx phages has been demonstrated  <cit> , even within the o157:h <dig> lineage itself  <cit> , so it is not unexpected to find such variation between different ehec  <dig> strains. in addition, ogura et al. propose that stx phages have alternative integration sites in ehec  <dig>  <cit> ; this may explain our lack of detection of integrase genes, as integration site specificity is dependent on the alignment of the phage integrase with the attachment sequence in the bacterial chromosome  <cit> . strains that were stx negative in our study were, nevertheless, found to carry genes from the sp <dig> and sp <dig> phages, which is a common effect of frequent modular shuffling of sequences between phages of related enteric hosts  <cit> . the significance of the unique conservation patterns of sp <dig> and sp <dig> phage genes is not clear. sp <dig> is perhaps more conserved as it harbors non-lee effector genes  <cit> , all  <dig> of which were detected in at least  <dig> out of  <dig> ehec  <dig> strains. absence of the entire sp <dig> was also detected among o157:h <dig> strains  <cit> , one of which belongs to a hyper-virulent lineage of the o157:h <dig> population  <cit> .

incongruent divergence of lee operons has been previously suggested. studies indicate that this island is a dynamic region  <cit> , and that different selective pressures act on different parts of the lee  <cit> . the sequence diversity of the lee, both at the nucleotide and amino acid level, increases along the length of the island from the lee <dig> to the lee <dig> operon  <cit> . a comparable trend can be observed in the cgh data presented here, as there was greater conservation of the content of genes that encode the secretion apparatus . however, differences in the content of o157:h <dig> sakai lee genes between human and animal ehec  <dig> strains of the same serotype  suggest that the lee has diverged between ehec  <dig> strains in a host dependent manner, possibly due to host species adaptive pressure. this result was not expected and its implications are not supported by the current literature. multiple, parallel acquisitions of the lee by different clonal groups have been inferred  <cit> .

muniesa et al. suggest that the lee genes associated with serogroup o <dig> are present more commonly in stec than the lee genes associated with ehec o157:h <dig> or epec o127:h <dig>  <cit> . yet, there is no clear evidence to support the hypothesis that lee divergence within a lineage results from positive adaptive pressure in different host species. in fact, when several lee genes from strain rdec- <dig> were compared to those from other aeec, the variation appeared to be associated with evolutionary lineage and not host specificity  <cit> . even so, given the heterogeneous diversification of this island and the recent inference about host-specific expression of espa and eae in o157:h <dig>  <cit> , it would be interesting to compare complete lee sequences from a larger sample of ehec  <dig> strains of human and animal origin.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we present an assessment of the gene content of a set of ehec  <dig> clinical strains of animal and human origin, isolated from the usa and europe. the small subset of phylogenetically compatible genes represent potential markers that will aid in the investigation of the relatedness and cladogenesis of the ehec  <dig> clonal group. in this study, serotype o26:h <dig>  the most frequent ehec  <dig> serotype associated with overt disease, represented the most diverse ehec  <dig> population. compared to the more homogeneous o111:h <dig> strains, o26:h <dig> strains may have an increased propensity to laterally exchange dna, which may ultimately give rise to hyper-virulent lineages within ehec  <dig> o26:h <dig>  furthermore, the identification of several ehec-specific genes could potentially be used as novel genetic markers to identify strains belonging to this pathotype.
