BACKGROUND
the inducible transcription factor nf-κb has an important function in regulating immune and inflammatory responses, apoptosis, cell proliferation and differentiation and tumorigenesis  <cit> . nf-κb is induced in almost all cell types by different extracellular stimuli causing the activation of an enormous array of target genes  <cit> . the nf-κb transcription factor family comprises nfkb <dig> , nfkb <dig> , p <dig> , c-rel and relb, which form homo- and heterodimers. the most abundant, best-studied and "classical" form of nf-κb is a heterodimer consisting of the two subunits p <dig> and p <dig>  in most unstimulated cells, nf-κb is found as inactive transcription factor complex through its physical association with one of the several inhibitors of nf-κb   <cit> . this family of iκb's includes iκbα, iκbβ, iκbγ, iκbε , p100/p <dig> , iκb-r and bcl- <dig>  virtually all cell types show nf-κb responses where the activity of nf-κb is specifically regulated at multiple levels  <cit> : the level of protein synthesis, the existence of at least  <dig> different nf-κb dimers, the interaction of these dimers with specific iκbs and their subcellular localization, post-translational modification of these dimers in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, differential accessibility of κb sites in various promoter and enhancer, differential binding to κb's response elements due to different affinities, and cell type and stimuli specific interaction with a combination of cofactors.

nf-κb is subject to a variety of post-translational modifications  that modulate its activity. phosphorylation of the p <dig> subunit by the pkac, msk <dig> and pkcζ kinases enhances its interaction with the co-activator p300/cbp and stimulates the nf-κb transcriptional activity  <cit> , while dephosphorylation of p <dig> by the phosphatase wip <dig> negatively affected the interaction with p <dig>  <cit> . it has recently been shown that p <dig> and p <dig> are reversibly acetylated by p <dig> and pcaf  <cit> . chen et al. identified lysine residues   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of p <dig> as acceptor sites for p <dig> acetylation. kiernan et al. identified k <dig> and  <dig> in p <dig> as acetylation sites modified by both p <dig> and p/caf. a recent report presented the tgf-β1-mediated acetylation of p <dig> at k <dig> in vitro and in vivo enhancing the induced activation of nf-κb by bacteria  <cit> . we recently confirmed acetylation on k <dig> and provided further evidence for acetylation of p <dig> on k <dig> and  <dig>  two novel acetylation sites  <cit> . genetic complementation of p <dig> knockout  cells with wild type and acetylation-deficient mutants of p <dig> revealed that neither shuttling, dna binding nor the induction of anti-apoptotic genes by tnfα was affected by acetylation on these residues. micro array analysis of these cells treated with tnfα for only  <dig> minutes identified specific sets of genes differently regulated by wild type or acetylation-deficient mutants of p <dig>  <cit> . specific genes were either stimulated or repressed by the acetylation-deficient mutants when compared to p <dig> wild type. these results support the hypothesis that site-specific p300-mediated acetylation of p <dig> regulates the specificity of nf-κb dependent gene expression.

here, we extended the gene expression analysis to three hours after tnfα stimulation and identified genes, which are higher expressed by mutating k <dig> and  <dig>  chip experiments with antibodies directed against acetylated k <dig> revealed that this lysine is indeed acetylated when p <dig> is bound to chromatin. together our results provide evidence that acetylation of k <dig> is important for the regulation of nf-κb-dependent gene expression in vivo.

RESULTS
mutation of p <dig> k314/ <dig> regulates tnfα-induced nf-κb-dependent gene expression at  <dig> hours
we provided earlier evidence that acetylation of p <dig> at k <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> is important for the expression of a defined subset of genes  <cit> . these earlier studies provided a first glance of the functional relevance of p <dig> acetylation, since gene expression was measured only after  <dig> minutes of tnfα stimulation. in order to know if the requirement for site-specific acetylation is maintained for the same genes after longer exposure to tnfα, and to identify possible new genes regulated through p <dig> acetylation, we decided to extend our analysis to  <dig> hours of stimulation. for this, we used p <dig> mouse embryonic fibroblasts  complemented with acetylation-deficient mutants, where the target lysines for acetylation were mutated to arginines. these cells were described and extensively characterized previously  <cit> . p <dig> cells complemented either with wild type p <dig>  an empty plasmid as control , the acetylation-deficient double mutant k314/315r or the triple mutant ktr , were stimulated by tnfα for  <dig> hours and total rna was isolated in three independent replicates from these cells. rna was amplified, labeled and hybridized to the agilent whole mouse genome array. after statistical analysis of the expression profiles, differentially expressed genes were identified . we focused only on genes that required p <dig> for their proper induction, which were identified by comparing gene expression profiles from wild type and ptv cells. the majority of differentially expressed genes in ktr mutant were strongly downregulated compared to wild type cells, suggesting that acetylation of p <dig> at these residues is also an important modification for the expression of the extended nf-κb-dependent gene expression . in contrast, experiments with the double k314/315r mutant revealed that the majority of genes were slightly upregulated after  <dig> hours compared to wild type cells .

gene expression of mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> is enhanced when k314/ <dig> are mutated
we subsequently investigated the induction kinetics of several genes by real-time rt-pcr in the complemented cell lines stimulated by tnfα for different time points . selection of these genes was based on their inducibility by tnfα, as well as their dependency on p <dig> and their regulation by acetylation of k314/ <dig>  mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> represented genes that were upregulated in the micro array experiments of k314/315r but not affected in ktr expressing cells. in contrast, cfb and mpa2l represented genes that were not affected in cells expressing k314/315r, but ktr, suggesting that acetylation of k <dig> is important for these genes. overall, the absolute mrna levels of mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> were strongly and significantly increased upon time  in cells expressing the k314/315r mutant , while the expression levels of cfb and mpa2l were not affected in the same cells , corroborating our micro array results. gene expression analysis in cells expressing the ktr mutant indeed confirmed that k <dig> is important for cfb and mpa2l, but counteracts the effect of k314/315r for mmp <dig> or mmp <dig> expression. interestingly, the dependency on k <dig> acetylation for cfb and mpa2l was already observed when the basal expression levels were analyzed .

characterization of antibodies raised against acetylated lysine  <dig> and  <dig> of p65
to further assess the functional relevance of p <dig> acetylation in vivo, we generated different antibodies raised against the acetylated k <dig> or k <dig>  all raised antibodies recognized their specific p300-mediated acetylated residues on recombinant p <dig> acetylated in vitro  or on over expressed p <dig> acetylated in vivo .

to confirm that endogenous p <dig> is indeed acetylated at the indicated lysines, immunoprecipitation experiments with the antibodies raised against acetylated k <dig>  k <dig> or against p <dig> were performed. the antibody anti-ack <dig> immunoprecipitated p <dig> only in cells complemented with wild type p <dig> in a tnfα-dependent manner . no p <dig> was immunoprecipitated in cells expressing the k314/315r or the ktr p <dig> mutant , suggesting, that endogenous p <dig> is indeed acetylated at k <dig> upon stimulation with tnfα. unfortunately, anti-ack <dig> was not specific enough to recognize endogenous acetylation at k <dig> 

chromatin-associated p <dig> is acetylated at lysine 314
from the above selected genes only cfb was already described to contain a κb site in its promoter  <cit> . we therefore searched for putative κb sites within the dna sequence  <dig> kb upstream of the transcription start site  of the selected genes. bioinformatic analysis identified several putative κb sites in the promoters of mmp <dig> and cfb, one site in the promoter of mpa2l, but none for mmp <dig> . mmp <dig> was thus not further investigated. chip studies in p <dig> mefs stimulated with tnfα for  <dig> and  <dig> minutes revealed that p <dig> was recruited to the promoters of cfb and mpa2l in a stimulus-dependent manner, while no enrichment was observed in p <dig> mefs . these recruitments were promoter-specific, since p <dig> occupancy to promoter of glucagon, a negative control, was not induced upon tnfα stimulation. ip- <dig>  a known nf-κb target gene with very well characterized κb sites at its promoter, served additionally as a positive control. unfortunately, no p <dig> enrichment could be observed to the κb sites of mmp <dig> , indicating that p <dig> would activate this gene through other κb sites or other transcription factors.

interestingly, chip experiments using the anti-acetyl k <dig> antibodies showed that chromatin-associated p <dig> is indeed acetylated at k <dig> on all analyzed genes  , although the expression of these genes was not affected by mutating k314/ <dig> . furthermore, the detected amount of recruited p <dig>  which was acetylated at k <dig>  increased over time . unfortunately, the antibody raised against acetyl k <dig> was not able to immunoprecipitate p <dig> under the tested conditions . together, these experiments identified mpa2l as a novel nf-κb target gene through the recruitment of p <dig> to its promoter and provide strong evidence that chromatin-bound p <dig> is indeed acetylated at k <dig> 

discussion
we have previously shown that p <dig> acetylation plays an important role in regulating nf-κb-dependent transcription of a subset of genes. our current results confirm those earlier findings by identifying new genes differentially regulated in the acetylation-deficient mutants compared to wild type cells. remarkably, only a few genes identified after  <dig> hours tnfα stimulation overlapped with the genes identified in our previous study after  <dig> minutes tnfα stimulation . we also observed that tnfα does not induce nf-κb activity in the complemented mefs as efficiently as in the parental p <dig> mefs used for chip . therefore, although our complemented mefs are useful to address the role of p <dig> acetylation in vivo, we might have identified only part of the genes influenced by p <dig> acetylation with the micro array screen.

cfb was previously suggested to be a direct target of nf-κb by emsa experiments  <cit> . our chip assays confirmed that p <dig> is recruited to cfb promoter in a tnfα-dependent manner in vivo and further identified mpa2l as a novel nf-κb target gene. although mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> were differentially expressed in acetylation-deficient mutant cells compared to wild type cells, we failed to detect p <dig> recruitment to those promoters. one explanation could be that p <dig> is recruited to the promoter region of these genes with a different kinetics than the one we investigated here. alternatively, p <dig> could bind to a regulatory element located far away from the promoter to regulate transcription, as has been shown for several nf-κb target genes  <cit> . nf-κb is known to activate the expression of many transcription factors and their regulators  <cit> ; consequently, a third possibility is that p <dig> directly induces the expression of a protein that regulates the expression of these genes. along this line, nf-κb has been shown to directly activate the expression of the transcription factor elk- <dig>  which in turn induces mmp <dig> gene expression  <cit> .

interestingly, the stimulatory effect of mutating k314/ <dig> was lost when additionally mutating k <dig>  suggesting that k <dig> acetylation is not affected by the lack of k314/ <dig> acetylation, and that the modification of k <dig> would counteract the effect of k314/ <dig> at the particular tested genes. furthermore, the effect of mutating k314/ <dig> on gene expression was more obvious after  <dig> hours of stimulation compared to early time points , suggesting that acetylation of these lysines might more likely affect termination of gene expression than its induction itself. here, we provide for the first time evidence that endogenous, chromatin-bound p <dig> is indeed acetylated at k <dig> upon stimulation with tnfα. unfortunately, acetylation of k <dig> could not be confirmed due to the lack of a specific acetylation-dependent antibody that recognizes endogenous proteins. interestingly, we observed acetylation of p <dig> k <dig> at promoters of genes whose expression was not affected by mutating k314/ <dig> . thus, it could well be that p <dig> is acetylated upon recruitment of p <dig> at promoters of many genes, but that the expression of only some of these genes is affected by p <dig> acetylation at distinct lysines.

the observation that mutation of k314/ <dig> increases expression of certain genes  suggests that acetylation of k <dig> and possibly k <dig> might represses gene expression. a possible molecular mechanism is that acetylated lysines at p <dig> create docking sites for bromodomain-containing proteins which need to be recruited to promoters to modulate transcription  <cit> . on the other hand, we can currently not exclude that lysines  <dig> and/or  <dig> are modified by another post-translation modification  and that mutating these residues would thus affect gene expression independently of acetylation. however, provided the observed acetylation of chromatin-bound p <dig> at k <dig>  acetylation is more likely to compete with another lysine modification, possibly resulting in crosstalk between different modifications  <cit> . indeed, a recent study reported that these same two lysines  can be methylated by set <dig> to induce ubiquitinylation of nf-κb and subsequently terminate gene expression  <cit> . thus, acetylation at k <dig> and possibly k <dig> could prevent methylation-mediated repression of target genes and thus avoid methylation-induced termination of p65-dependent gene expression. a direct evidence for methylated p <dig> at k314/ <dig> bound to chromatin is however still missing. whether the same genes are regulated by both post-translational modifications should be further addressed. alternatively, both post-translational modifications might regulate distinct set of nf-κb-dependent genes and thus not influence each other.

CONCLUSIONS
together, our results establish acetylation of k <dig> as an important regulatory modification of p <dig> and subsequently of nf-κb-dependent gene expression.
