BACKGROUND
west nile virus , a mosquito-borne single-stranded rna virus, had been known to cause endemic febrile disease in africa, the middle east, europe and asia  <cit> . since the concurrent outbreaks of encephalitis among humans, horses and birds in new york in  <dig>  <cit> , wnv has spread rapidly across north america  <cit> . wnv has considerable public health impact because of large annual epidemics of human neuroinvasive disease  <cit> . wnv proliferates in birds and is transmitted to humans, horses and other animals by mosquitoes. after invading the hosts, wnv seems to proliferate in lymphoid tissue and causes viremia  <cit> . wnv then penetrates the blood brain barrier  and causes encephalitis with neuronal cell death. neurons are the main target of the virus in the central nervous system , since viral antigens are mainly detected in these cells  <cit> .

in addition to the neuronal disease, wnv-associated inflammation outside the cns can occur in humans. khouzam  <cit>  reported the case of a patient who had diffuse myocardial damage secondary to wnv infection. rhabdomyolysis was reported in a patient with wnv encephalitis  <cit> . armah et al.  <cit>  reported systemic distribution of wnv infection in  <dig> human cases in which viral antigens were detected in cns, kidney, lungs, pancreas, thyroid, intestine, stomach, esophagus, bile duct, skin, prostate and testis. these studies suggest that wnv can invade and proliferate in multiple tissues.

shirato et al.  <cit>  suggested that the difference in the neuroinvasiveness between the highly virulent ny <dig> strain and the non-lethal eg  <dig>  strain is associated with the viral replication in spleen. one of the reasons ny <dig> strain gains this virulent phenotype might be an enhancement of invasiveness to the peripheral tissues. blood-borne pathogens must encounter endothelial cells of blood capillaries to invade the target organs. verma et al.  <cit>  demonstrated the mechanism by which wnv crosses endothelial cells using human brain microvascular endothelial  cell culture. their data suggested that wnv crosses hbmve cells via a transcellular pathway after viral replication in endothelial cells. however, the possibility that wnv crosses endothelial cells without viral replication cannot be excluded, since wnv infection of endothelial cells is rarely detected in human cases  <cit> . it is still unclear if a transcellular mechanism is also involved in viral invasion to endothelial cells of peripheral tissues.

in this study, we assessed the possibility that wnv has an ability to cross human endothelial cells. to eliminate the influence of viral replication in endothelial cells, we used virus-like particles  which can infect susceptible cells without production of progeny virions. our results suggest that vlps of the ny99- <dig> 6-lp  strain cross human umbilical vein endothelial cells  by a transcellular pathway. we also showed that the 6-lp vlps were transported greater than vlps of the low-virulence eg strain, which depends on ser  <dig> and val  <dig> of e protein.

RESULTS
wnv 6-lp vlps are transferred across human endothelial cells
huvec were seeded on the membranes of transwells, which have  <dig>  μm pores. the presence of the tight junction with an increase of transendothelial electrical resistance  was confirmed  <dig> days after seeding. here we used vlps previously reported by scholle et al.  <cit> . vlps can infect cells because of the presence of the structural proteins  that are present in infectious virions. vlps contain replicon rna, which encodes the wnv nonstructural proteins and the enhanced green fluorescent protein , but lacks the sequence of structural proteins. after vlp infection of susceptible cells, replicon rna is released and replicates in the cytoplasm accompanied by the expression of egfp. however, progeny particles are not produced because of the lack of expression of structural proteins in vlp-infected cells.

to assess the possibility that huvec can transport vlps, huvec were exposed to 6-lp vlps or eg vlps at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig> . the number of vlps transferred to the lower chambers was determined by infectious unit  assay at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h post infection  . 6-lp vlps were detected at  <dig> h p.i. and increased approximately 2-fold at  <dig> h p.i. on the other hand, few eg vlps were detected at  <dig> and  <dig> h p.i. the amount of the transferred 6-lp vlps was significantly higher than that of eg vlps at  <dig> and  <dig> h p.i. . these results suggested that 6-lp vlps were transferred across huvec and that the transfer of eg vlps was much less efficient.

6-lp vlps were transported without altering the integrity of tight junction
verma et al.  <cit>  suggested that wnv replicates in the hbmve cells and that the progeny virus crosses the bbb via a transcellular pathway without impairing the integrity of tight junction. however, vlps used in this study do not produce progeny virions. thus, there is a possibility that 6-lp vlps cross from the apical to the basolateral side by disrupting tight junction.

to assess this possibility, the distribution of a tight junction marker zo- <dig> was analyzed by immunocytochemistry at  <dig> h p.i. . the localization of zo- <dig> was not visibly affected in 6-lp vlp-exposed huvec, when compared to the untreated control. we also measured the permeability of 70k dextran  to check the integrity of the tight junction . the permeability of 70k dx in vlp-exposed huvec was similar to that in untreated cells by this assay. it has been known that tnf-α exposure induces changes in endothelial cell morphology and permeability  <cit> . therefore, we treated the cells by tnf-α as a control. treatment of huvec with tnf-α at  <dig> μg/ml greatly impaired the integrity of the tight junction .

6-lp vlps cross huvec via a transcellular pathway
to assess the involvement of a transcellular pathway, we examined the effects of chlorpromazine and filipin on vlp transport. chlorpromazine disrupts the recycling of ap- <dig> from endosomes and prevents the assembly of clathrin-coated pits on the plasma membrane  <cit> . filipin is a sterol-binding agent and prevents the formation of cholesterol-dependent membrane rafts  <cit> . the optimal concentration of chlorpromazine and filipin was determined by the inhibition of the uptake of transferrin and cholera toxin subunit b, which are known as ligands for clathrin-and lipid-rafts-dependent endocytosis, respectively . huvec were exposed to 6-lp vlps in the presence or absence of the inhibitor. fitc-labeled 70k dx was also added to the transwells with 6-lp vlps to evaluate the tight junction integrity. the transport of vlps was inhibited by filipin , but was not significantly by chlorpromazine . in contrast, the permeability of 70k dx was not impaired by either chlorpromazine or filipin . these results suggested that lipid rafts are involved in vlps transport.

transport of 6-lp vlps depends on e protein
it is known that e protein interacts with viral receptors on the host cells  <cit>  resulting in the induction of receptor mediated endocytosis  <cit> . to examine whether e protein is involved in the transport of vlps, we generated chimeric vlps using 6-lp and eg vlps. 6-lp cm eg e vlps have c and m/prm proteins derived from 6-lp strain and e protein from eg strain. eg cm 6-lp e vlps have c and m/prm protein from eg strain and e protein from 6-lp strain. huvec were exposed to wild type or chimeric vlps and transported vlps were detected by ifu assay at  <dig> h p.i . the transport of eg cm 6-lp e vlps was similar to that of wild type 6-lp vlps and was significantly higher than those of 6-lp cm eg e vlps and wild type eg vlps . 6-lp cm eg e vlps were rarely transported across huvec as well as wild type eg vlps. these results suggest that the transport of vlps across huvec is strongly affected by e protein.

multiple amino acid residues of e protein influence the transport of 6-lp vlps
the e proteins of the 6-lp and eg strain differ at  <dig> amino acid residues. to determine the residues that enhance the transport of 6-lp vlps, we produced mutant vlps . 6-lp s156p vlps and 6-lp v159i vlps had significantly reduced transport compared to wild type 6-lp vlps  although the amount of transported vlps was much higher than that of eg vlps . as shown in fig. 4b, eg k93r vlps and eg t126i vlps showed increased transport compared to wild type eg vlps . the transport of eg i159v was significantly increased , although it was much lower than 6-lp vlps. previous studies reported that ser  <dig> is involved in the n-linked glycosylation at  <dig>  which is important for virulence and neuroinvasion  <cit> . therefore, we expected that the transport of eg p <dig> s would be increased. however, the transport of eg p <dig> s vlps was significantly lower than that of wt eg vlps . these results suggest that multiple residues of e protein can influence the transport of vlps.

the combination of ser  <dig> and val  <dig> is important for the transport of 6-lp vlps
from the result of fig 4b, the transport of eg p <dig> s did not increase. this finding suggests the possibility that the combination of amino acids at the position of  <dig> and  <dig> might affect the transport of vlps. to assess this hypothesis, we generated double mutants, 6-lp s156p v159i and eg p <dig> s i159v . as shown in fig.  <dig>  the transport of 6-lp s156p v159i was greatly reduced  to the level of wild type eg vlps. the transport of eg p <dig> s i159v was greatly increased  to the level of wild type 6-lp vlps. these results suggest that the combination of ser  <dig> and val  <dig> is important for the transport of 6-lp vlps across huvec.

combination of amino acid sequence at  <dig> and  <dig> does not affect the n-linked glycosylation of e protein
from the results of figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  we speculated that the combination of amino acid sequence at  <dig> and  <dig> might affect n-linked glycosylation at the position  <dig> resulting in unglycosylation of e protein of eg p <dig> s. to assess this possibility, we analyzed the glycosylation of e protein in 6-lp vlps, eg vlps, 6-lp s156p, eg p <dig> s, 6-lp v159i, eg i159v, 6-lp s156p v159i and eg p <dig> s i159v. western blotting of e protein showed the band of wild type 6-lp strain was higher than that of eg strain  because of glycosylation. e protein of 6-lp s156p, eg i159v and 6-lp s156p v159i was unglycosylated , whereas e protein of 6-lp v159i and eg p <dig> s i159v was glycosylated . interestingly, e protein of eg p <dig> s was also glycosylated . these results suggest that the combination of the residues  <dig> and  <dig> does not affect the n-linked glycosylation and that glycosylation of e protein is not the determinant of the transport of vlps.

discussion
wnv ny strains have a highly virulent phenotype compared to the eg strain which was isolated in africa. their enhanced replication in peripheral tissues may lead to long-lasting viremia resulting in increasing incidence of viral invasion to cns. the interaction of the virus with endothelial cells of blood capillaries could be involved in wnv invasion to target organs. in this study, we assessed the transport of wnv ny <dig> 6-lp strain and eg strain across human endothelial cells. our data demonstrate that vlps of the 6-lp strain were transported across human endothelial cells more than vlps of the eg strain.

microbial invasion across endothelial cells can occur through transcellular pathway mediated by vesicles, paracellular entry after disruption of the tight junctions, or "trojan horse" mechanism by transport within circulating phagocytic cells  <cit> . our data indicate that 6-lp vlps are transported by a transcellular pathway, because the transport of vlps was inhibited by the treatment with filipin, a modifier of lipid raft-associated membrane transport. clathrin-dependent pathways seem to be less important because the treatment with chlorpromazine had no significant effect on the transport of vlps. paracellular entry is unlikely to be involved in transport of vlps because the structure of zo- <dig> and the permeability of dx 70k were not altered during vlp transport.

our data partially support the results by verma et al.  <cit>  which suggested that wnv crosses hbmve cells without altering the integrity of tight junction. the authors concluded that wnv replicates in endothelial cells and the progeny viruses are transported from the apical to basolateral side. however, our data suggest that wnv can be transported across endothelial cells without viral replication. cell type difference could be the most reasonable explanation, because several studies showed that there are differences between hbmve cells and huvec in the production of growth factors, immunoregulatory factors and adhesion molecules  <cit> . hbmve cells and huvec differentially respond to cytokine treatment resulting in the different cytokine production and leukocyte recruitment  <cit> . particularly, modulation of adhesion molecules can affect endocytosis  <cit> . therefore, our data seem to reflect events that can occur in peripheral tissues having tight junction such as heart and muscles rather than in cns.

in wnv-infected mice, viral replication in peripheral tissues results in the inflammatory cytokine production such as tnf-α, il- <dig> and macrophage migration inhibitory factor  <cit> . although the role of these cytokines in infection still remains controversial, vascular permeability can be affected by the presence of these cytokines  <cit> . one of the mechanisms for the impairment of vascular permeability by these cytokines is disruption of tight junctions of endothelial cells  <cit> . promotion of vesicular transport of endothelial cells, including pinocytosis and transcytosis, is also affected by these cytokines  <cit> . paracellular invasion by disruption of the tight junction induced by cytokines could occur in vivo, however, there is a possibility that wnv also utilizes a transcellular pathway, which might be promoted by inflammatory cytokines.

the analysis of vlps with chimeric e proteins showed that e protein determines the difference in the transport across huvec between the 6-lp and eg strains. our data also suggest that multiple amino acid residues of e protein are influential. it has been well known that the sequence nys/t at the residues 154- <dig> is important for glycosylation associated with the virulence of wnv and that strains possessing proline at the residue  <dig> lack glycosylation  <cit> . the prototype wnv strain b <dig> has a  <dig> amino acid deletion in the residues 156- <dig> resulting in absence of glycosylation  <cit> . the position of glycosylation seems to be also important, since the wni- <dig> and wni-25a strains which have n-glycosylation at the residue  <dig>  do not show neuroinvasive phenotype  <cit> . the present study suggests that the combination of ser  <dig> and val  <dig> is important for transport of vlps across endothelial cells, which might be associated with the invasion of wnv into the target organs.

the transport of eg p <dig> s vlps was lower than that of wt eg vlps in spite of the presence of glycosylation. the residues 156- <dig> form two turns of α-helix, termed αa', although e proteins of dengue virus serotype  <dig>  and tick-borne encephalitis virus  lack the amino acids 157- <dig> resulting in the absence of this structure <cit> . the α-helix shifts the glycosylation site about  <dig> Å to the exterior and lateral surfaces of e protein with respect to those of e proteins of denv- <dig> and tbev. davis et al.  <cit>  showed that modulation of n-glycosylation of wnv e protein modified the attachment to dc-signr. as well as the existence of proline and the deletion of the amino acids between the residues 156- <dig>  there is a possibility that the combination of amino acid residues at  <dig> and  <dig> might affect the structure of αa' and position of glycosylation site, resulting in modulation of the binding affinity to a lectin or unknown binding molecules on huvec. this, in turn, could be a reason for the unsuccessful transport of eg p <dig> s vlps.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we propose a transcellular mechanism by which wnv crosses endothelial cells and enters the target organs. we also suggest that higher transendothelial migration ability could be one of the determinants of the different virulence of the ny and eg strains, and that this depends on ser  <dig> and val  <dig> of e protein.
