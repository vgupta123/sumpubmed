BACKGROUND
cold-inducible rna-binding protein  is the first cold shock protein identified in mammals  <cit> . being composed of one consensus sequence-rna binding domain and a carboxyl-terminal region containing several arginine glycine glycine motifs, it is structurally quite different from bacterial cold shock proteins. expression of cirp is induced in response to mild, but not severe, hypothermia. cirp is also induced by cellular stresses such as uv irradiation and hypoxia  <cit> . upon stress induction, cirp shuttles from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and affects stability and translation of its target mrnas  <cit> . cirp modulates cell cycle progression, protects cells from various stresses, and possibly functions as an oncoprotein  <cit> . cirp is constitutively expressed in a variety of tissues and cells, predominantly in the testis and brain, and contributes to the maintenance of normal cellular functions as well. recently, we have produced cirp-knockout mice and demonstrated that cirp stimulates proliferation of undifferentiated spermatogonia by interacting with dyrk1b/mirk protein  <cit> . the mechanism underlying the induction of cold shock proteins by mild hypothermia has not yet been fully elucidated.

specificity protein  <dig>  is a member of the large multigene family of sp/kruppel-like factor transcription factors that can activate or repress transcription in response to physiologic and pathologic stimuli  <cit> . these proteins share a highly conserved dna binding domain, and through  <dig> adjacent c2h2-type zinc fingers at the c-terminus, they bind to gc boxes, caccc boxes, and basic transcription elements. sp <dig> through sp <dig> form a subgroup that contains glutamine-rich transactivating domains. sp <dig>  sp <dig>  and sp <dig> have  <dig> such domains, whereas sp <dig> has only  <dig> and exhibits different dna binding specificity. sp <dig> and sp <dig> are expressed ubiquitously, whereas sp <dig> is expressed primarily in neural cells. often in cooperation with other transcription factors, sp proteins regulate the expression of numerous genes implicated in the control of a diverse array of cellular processes, such as cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis  <cit> .

a number of biotechnology products currently marketed are large molecules, produced from genetically modified mammalian cell lines, and extracted through complex and lengthy purification procedures  <cit> . the expiration of patents for expensive protein drugs and the development of monoclonal antibodies as therapeutics have intensified competitive efforts to improve the productivity of recombinant proteins. one area in which there is currently a large volume of interest with regard to improving recombinant protein production in mammalian cells is through the use of lower temperature cultivation  <cit> . mild hypothermic conditions result in prolonged generation time, maintenance of cell viability for longer periods, reduced glucose and glutamine consumption, suppressed release of waste products, delayed apoptosis, reduced protease activity and decreased o <dig> demand among others  <cit> . the overall effects, however, vary among cell lines, expression systems, and the product of interest, and opportunities exist for further enhancement of the cold shock effect on recombinant protein production in mammalian cells  <cit> .

in the present study, we identified the mild-cold responsive element  in the 5′ flanking region of the mouse cirp gene, which enhances gene expression at 32°c in cultured mammalian cells. we have found that sp <dig> binds to the identified mcre sequence, and that downregulation of sp <dig> expression suppresses the induction of cirp gene expression at 32°c. we have also shown that mcre can be utilized to increase the yield of recombinant proteins produced in mammalian cells.

RESULTS
identification of the cis-regulatory element that enhances gene expression at 32°c
to analyze the transcriptional regulation of cirp expression, we isolated an approximately  <dig> kb-long 5′ genomic fragment upstream of the transcription start site. when we inserted the gene fragment spanning from position − <dig> to + <dig>  into the pcdna5/frt vector containing f-luc cdna without promoter and transfected nih/3t <dig> flp-in cells with this plasmid, the expression level of f-luc mrna was higher at 32°c than 37°c, whereas there was not much difference in the degradation rate of mrna at 37°c and 32°c . therefore, we made a series of constructs containing different 5′ deletions of the −970/+ <dig> fragment and tested their transcriptional activity by transiently transfecting hek <dig> cells . with the −970/+ <dig> fragment, higher expression of the reporter was observed at 32°c than 37°c as expected. when the −340/- <dig> region was deleted from the −340/+ <dig> fragment, the transcriptional activity dropped more than 10-fold and the activity at 32°c became less than that at 37°c. negligible expression was observed without the −120/- <dig> fragment, suggesting the presence of basal promoter activity within it. in order to determine the enhancer fragment responsible for the response to moderate cold, we subdivided the −340/- <dig> fragment and tested each fragment for the enhancer activity using the sv <dig> minimal promoter. as shown in figure 1b, the −320/- <dig> and −260/- <dig> fragments enhanced the expression more than twofold at 32°c relative to 37°c. we noticed that the octanucleotide sequence 5′-tccccgcc-3′ was common to both fragments . when three copies of 5′-ttccccgccg-3′ containing this octanucleotide were directly joined together and placed upstream of the sv <dig> promoter, the expression of cat reporter was enhanced at 32°c as much as the cirp −340/- <dig> fragment . using the same expression constructs, we observed similar enhancing effects at 32°c in human u- <dig> os cells, human hela cells, mouse nih/3t <dig> cells, mouse balb/3t <dig> cells and chinese hamster cho-k <dig> cells as well. thus, we named this octanucleotide sequence as the mild-cold responsive element . the mutants of mcre with a replacement of the first base t by a, g, or c showed similar enhancer activities to that of the wild type . the second through 8th bases, however, showed base preferences.


application of mcre to recombinant protein production
various methods have been developed to increase the yield and reduce the production costs of recombinant proteins, and in many studies human secreted alkaline phosphatase  is utilized as a model product  <cit> . to see if mcre can be utilized to enhance the production of recombinant proteins in stably transfected mammalian cells, we directly connected  <dig> or  <dig> copies of 5′-ttccccgccg-3′ without spacer and placed them upstream of the cmv promoter in the pcdna5/frt vector expressing seap. then, we transfected hek <dig> flp-in cells with the plasmids to generate stable transfectants. in contrast to the transient transfection experiments described above, the fold induction of seap expression at 32°c was not different with and without mcre. when we used  <dig> copies of the mcre and its active mutant  as enhancers in cho-k <dig> flp-in cells, the amount of seap recovered was increased  <dig> -fold at 32°c compared with that at 37°c . in the absence of the enhancer the increase was  <dig> -fold at 32°c. consistently, the seap mrna level was  <dig> -fold higher at 32°c compared with 37°c in the presence of the enhancer, but the levels were comparable at 32°c and 37°c in its absence . as the basal level of expression at 37°c was also increased in the presence of the mcre enhancer, the yield of seap obtained by culture at 32°c was  <dig> -fold higher compared with the regular 37°c culture without the enhancer . the mcre enhancer was also effective in increasing the production of erythropoietin, a biotechnological protein, in cho-k <dig> cells . the enhancer effect was observed in u- <dig> os cells as well .


binding of sp <dig> to mcre
to identify the proteins that bind to mcre and regulate gene expression, the nucleotide sequence of the mouse cirp gene 5′-flanking region  was analyzed by using the transcription element search system   <cit> . since tess predicted that sp <dig> binds to mcre, we assessed binding of cellular sp <dig> to mcre by electrophoretic mobility shift assay . nuclear protein extracts from hela cells contained proteins that bound to the 32p-labelled mcre probe in vitro . the intensity of one of the bands was increased when cells were cultured at 32°c compared with those cultured at 37°c, and could be competed out by a 50-fold molar excess of the unlabeled wild-type, but not mutant, probe indicating a specific interaction. the addition of anti-sp <dig> antibody produced a supershift of the band, whereas the anti-sp <dig> antibody had no effect. western blot analysis demonstrated that the amount of sp <dig> protein was increased , and immunofluorescence microscopy showed that more sp <dig> localized in the nucleus  when cells were cultured at 32°c.


to study whether sp <dig> binds to mcre in the cirp regulatory region in intact cells at 32°c, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays in balb/3t <dig> cells. we analyzed the 5′ upstream region containing mcre and the first intron of the cirp gene. we detected about a 5-fold enhancement of sp <dig> association with the mcre region, but not with the intron region, at 32°c . although both sp <dig> and sp <dig> preferentially bind to similar dna motifs, increased binding of sp <dig> was not observed, suggesting that mild hypothermia specifically increases recruitment of sp <dig> to the cirp regulatory region.

contribution of sp <dig> to increased cirp expression at 32°c
the binding of more sp <dig> to the cirp regulatory region does not necessarily imply that sp <dig> is involved in the induction of cirp expression in response to moderately low temperatures. to confirm this, we first analyzed the effects of sp <dig> expression on the endogenous cirp expression. as shown in figure 5a, overexpression of sp <dig> further increased the cirp protein levels after transferring the cells to 32°c. conversely, downregulation of sp <dig> by shrna decreased the cirp protein levels, and the induction of cirp at 32°c became less prominent. rescue of the effects of shrna by expression of an shrna-resistant mrna for wild-type sp <dig> indicted that the observed changes were not due to the off-target effects.


the reporter assays further demonstrated that overexpression of sp <dig> dose-dependently increased the transcriptional activity of the cirp upstream region containing mcre, whereas downregulation of sp <dig> expression suppressed it .

when mcre sequences were mutated in the reporter constructs, the enhancement of the reporter gene expression by sp <dig> overexpression became minimal , and the suppressive effects of sp <dig> downregulation were not observed . these results indicate that the effects of sp <dig> are mediated by its interaction with the mcre.


discussion
we and others have previously reported that the half-life of cirp mrnas is only marginally influenced by temperature down-shift  <cit> . consistent with a notion that the transcription rate of cirp is increased at moderately low temperatures, we have herein identified a mcre in the 5′ flanking region of the cirp gene that enhances gene expression at 32°c. we further demonstrated that sp <dig> binds to mcre, and that more sp <dig> is localized in the nucleus at 32°c to bind to the genomic region containing mcre. in addition, the reporter assays with mutant mcre and modulation of the sp <dig> expression level showed that the expression of cirp is dependent, at least partly, on sp <dig> and mcre and that sp <dig> contributes to the cold shock response at 32°c.

cis-regulatory elements like enhancers and promoters are usually characterized by reporter gene assays in cultured cell lines  <cit> . we did the transient reporter gene assays using hek <dig> cells, and identified the mcre. although present in two different genomic fragments of cirp with enhancer activity, mutagenesis experiments of the identified mcre octanucleotide revealed that the first base could vary. furthermore, the binding sequences of sp <dig> predicted by tess in the cirp genome did not include the first base of the mcre, suggesting that the actual element might be the heptanucleotide 5′-ccccgcc-3′.

the cold-responsive enhancer activity of mcre was consistently observed when various cell lines including hek <dig> and cho-k <dig> cells were transiently transfected. in cells stably transfected with similar mcre constructs, however, the cold-inducible enhancer activity was difficult to observe. this result may not be so surprising because transient reporter gene assays are often a poor proxy for the activities of regulatory elements integrated in the genome, which can be active in narrow windows of development, differentiation and cellular conditions  <cit> . how the presence of many copies of mcre seemingly circumvented the problem has yet to be clarified. although many studies have suggested that recombinant protein production can be increased by culturing at sub-physiological temperatures  <cit> , low temperature also causes growth arrest of cells and suppression of gene expression in general, resulting in variable yields. thus, specific enhancement of the target gene transcription at 32°c by using mcre is a promising method to increase the final yield of recombinant proteins in various cell lines. interestingly, thaisuchat et al.  <cit>  have recently identified a novel temperature sensitive promoter  in the s100a <dig>  gene, which comprises two sp <dig> sites.

sp <dig> binds gc-rich motifs with high affinity and can regulate the expression of tata-containing and tata-less genes via multiple mechanisms  <cit> . sp <dig> generally activates gene transcription, whereas sp <dig> has both transcriptional repressor and activating properties. discher et al.  <cit>  showed by transient transfection that hypoxia enhances the expression of a reporter gene directed by the pyruvate kinase m promoter in myocytes. the hypoxia response was localized to a conserved gc-rich element that bound sp <dig> and sp <dig>  hypoxia induced gene expression because it caused depletion of sp <dig>  removing its transcriptional repression, whereas sp <dig> levels remained unchanged. this is unlikely the case with the cirp gene, as the western blotting and chip assays demonstrated that more sp <dig> bound to the chromatin region containing mcre at 32°c than 37°c, whereas the level of chromatin-bound sp <dig> did not differ between these temperatures.

although sp <dig> was once thought to serve mainly as a constitutive activator of housekeeping genes, growing evidence indicates that posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, sumoylation, ubiquitylation and glycosylation can influence the transcriptional activity and stability of sp <dig>  <cit> . for example, sp <dig> is phosphorylated at ser <dig> by ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase in response to dna damage, and the proportion of chromatin-bound phosphorylated sp <dig> rapidly increases  <cit> . thus, to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed increase in the amount of sp <dig> in the nucleus at 32°c, modifications of sp <dig> should be analyzed. furthermore, sp <dig> can regulate the expression of genes via interactions or interplay with other transcription factors such as ets- <dig>  c-myc, c-jun and egr- <dig>  and/or components of the basal transcriptional machinery, and has been linked to chromatin remodeling through interactions with p <dig> and histone deacetylases  <cit> . the factors collaborating or competing with ubiquitously expressed sp <dig> should be identified to clarify the underlying mechanism of cirp induction at moderately low temperatures.

CONCLUSIONS
a novel enhancer element, mcre, that promotes gene expression 3- to 7-fold in various cell lines upon a temperature shift to 32°c is described. in combination with moderately low culture temperatures, mcre can be utilized in transient as well as stable transfection to produce large amounts of proteins in a short period of time. by binding sp <dig>  mcre contributes to the induction of cirp at 32°c. elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the cold shock response will help develop novel strategies for the treatment of diseases involving cold shock proteins such as male infertility and cancers, and for the production of a variety of diagnostically and therapeutically useful recombinant proteins.
