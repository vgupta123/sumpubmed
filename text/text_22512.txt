BACKGROUND
fetal lung development is a programmed cascade and any interruption in this process may cause abnormalities in neonates after birth  <cit> . the process of lung development in all mammals is similar  <cit>  and is only different in the timing of development during perinatal and postnatal periods  <cit> . in eutherians, the placenta performs gaseous exchange between the fetus and the mother  <cit>  and during gestation the lung matures and is capable of performing gaseous exchange after birth  <cit> . the main cause of respiratory complication in new born infants is due to pulmonary immaturity, known as respiration distress syndrome  and the main cause of rds in preterm infants is lack of surfactant proteins in the lung  <cit> .

during evolution of mammals, marsupials and eutherians have adopted different reproductive strategies which have given rise to differences in lung maturation at birth. marsupials are placental mammals but they have a primitive form of placenta and give birth to immature young after a short gestation. the major growth and development of marsupial young occurs postnatally during early lactation  <cit> . the majority of eutherians, including the human, have a well-developed placenta and the lungs of neonates are at the alveolar stage of development  <cit> . in contrast, the lung in the marsupial newborn is immature and is still progressing from canalicular to early saccular stage of development  <cit> . the lung morphology of newborn marsupials, such as the short-tailed opossum  and tammar wallaby , are comprised of large terminal air sacs with a small surface area for respiration  <cit> . due to limited development of the neonatal lung the marsupial performs respiration through the skin to meet the demand for oxygen, and as the lung develops the total gaseous exchange is gradually shifted to the lung  <cit> . in all mammals, the extent of pulmonary development depends on the period of intrauterine development as the factors responsible for fetal development are provided through the maternal supply  <cit> . in marsupials the immature neonates rely on these maturation factors being provided through milk  <cit> . in eutherians at the end of gestation, the density of septal formation is high as the lung is progressing from saccular stages to the alveolar stage of development at birth. this septal division is carried out after birth to increase surface area for respiration by dividing large air sacs into alveoli. however alveolization requires necessary signalling factors for cell proliferation and function to produce surfactants and these are regulated by hormones in the newborn  <cit> . in contrast, the marsupial newborn lacks established functional hormonal systems  <cit> . in order to survive and develop they most likely need support from their mother through maternal milk  <cit> .

milk is composed of various bioactive components supporting early development of the neonate  <cit> . eutherians, such as the human, undergo a long gestation followed by a relatively short lactation and the composition of milk does not change significantly  <cit> . in contrast, marsupials have a short gestation and a long lactation and milk composition changes significantly throughout lactation to provide factors for growth and development of the immature neonate  <cit> . the tammar wallaby is one of most studied marsupials and its lactation is divided into three phases  based on the composition of the milk and growth and development of the young. tammar young are born after 26 days of gestation and weigh approximately  <dig> milligrams  <cit> . during the early phase of lactation, the young remain permanently attached to the teat and the mother secretes dilute milk with a low concentration of protein and lipids but a high concentration of carbohydrates  <cit> . during the first 100 days the development of the neonate is similar to a late stage eutherian fetus and therefore the signalling factors involved in the development of the eutherian fetus are most likely delivered in the milk  <cit> . the pouch young are born with immature organs and during early lactation the organs necessary for their survival such as respiratory system  <cit> , lymphoid tissues  <cit> , nervous system including brain and spinal-card  <cit>  are rapidly developed. fostering experiments performed with tammars to understand regulatory effects of milk composition on rate of pouch young development, have demonstrated that by transferring the early pouch young to a late lactating tammar can accelerate the growth and physical development of pouch young  <cit> . subsequent studies showed that cross fostering the young also accelerated maturation of specific organs such as the stomach  <cit> . hence, the tammar provides an exceptional model for correlating milk composition with defined developmental changes in the immature lungs of the newborn as the respiratory process progresses from gas exchange across the skin to functional lungs during lactation. in this study we demonstrate the effect of bioactives in tammar wallaby milk collected in early lactation to accelerate growth and development of cultured mouse embryonic lungs.

RESULTS
postnatal development of lungs from tammar wallaby
lungs of the near-term fetal tammar  had primitive airways and canalicular like structures throughout . lungs of newborn tammar pouch young   were immature with few terminal branches and large terminal air sacs with a thick wall, and the majority of tissue was comprised of mesenchyme. the lung at day  <dig> postpartum  consisted of respiratory bronchioles terminated with large sac like structures. around 20 days of age  the large air sacs had undergone subdivision by formation of septa and the number of air sacs had increased. at this stage the majority of the lung was still comprised of sac like structures separated by connective tissue. the alveoli-like structure appears by day  <dig> , however at day  <dig> they appear quite primitive and are transiting from sac-like stature to alveoli. defined alveoli start appearing from day  <dig> . by day  <dig>  the lung had undergone further subdivision of air sacs and septa formation, alveoli-like structures had continued to form . by day  <dig>  the lung progressed to a mature morphology with enhanced alveolization .figure  <dig>

tammar wallaby day  <dig> milk stimulates development of cultured mouse embryonic lung
to determine the potential effect of marsupial milk in lung development, embryonic lungs from mice were cultured in serum free media plus 10% tammar whey collected at day  <dig> of lactation . in control cultures the embryonic lungs were incubated in serum free media with 10% pbs . the embryonic lungs exposed to day  <dig> tammar milk whey showed extensive branching morphogenesis and increased volume over 3 days of culture . in contrast, the control embryonic lungs showed a relative delay in branching morphogenesis and the lung was smaller after 3 days of the culture . the number of terminal end buds significantly increased over 3 days in the lungs treated with day  <dig> milk . the level of expression of several developmental marker genes was assessed by using q-pcr analysis. the developmental marker genes sp-c  and sp-b  , wnt-7b  and bmp- <dig>  , and id- <dig>  each showed a significant increase in levels of expression relative to control lungs . further, embryonic lungs were cultured for 4 days in media with  <dig>   <dig> &  <dig> % of day  <dig> milk protein. to determine the effect of concentration of tammar milk on lung growth. no significant difference in number of terminal end buds was observed in tissue cultured in media with milk protein concentrations of 10%, 5% and  <dig> %. lungs cultured in media with each concentration of milk protein showed similar epithelial branching and vascular development which was significantly advanced when compared to lungs cultured in control media .figure  <dig>

tammar wallaby milk proteins from early lactation differentially regulate embryonic mouse lung development
to examine whether the signalling factors in day  <dig> milk responsible for lung development were secreted in other phases of lactation, mouse embryonic lung was incubated with milk proteins collected from day  <dig>  day  <dig>  day  <dig>  day  <dig>  day  <dig>  day 100 day  <dig> and day  <dig> of lactation . embryonic lungs  were cultured for 4 days in media with either 10% milk protein, 10% pbs or 10% bovine serum albumin . digital images of lung explants were examined every 24 hours and the number of terminal end buds determined . in control experiments where explants were cultured in media with either pbs  or media alone , the majority of the explant was populated with long tubules with poor branching morphogenesis. a significant reduction in end bud formation was evident and explants showed low branching morphogenesis until the end of 4 days of culture. in control experiments where embryonic lungs were cultured in media with bsa  and media that included day  <dig> tammar milk  the explants showed significant reductions in branching morphogenesis and the volume of lung remained similar to that observed at time zero. embryonic lung cultured in media with phase 2b tammar milk collected on day  <dig>  and day  <dig>  of lactation had commenced branching morphogenesis by day  <dig> in culture and there was no increase in total volume of lung, similar to that observed in embryonic lungs cultured in day  <dig> milk. these explants showed no significant increase in number of terminal end buds in comparison with control lung. in the explants treated with day  <dig> , day  <dig> , day  <dig>  day  <dig>  and day  <dig>  milk, the stimulatory effect on branching was more prominent with lung tissue showing branching morphogenesis after 48 h of culture and an accompanying increase in the number of terminal end buds when compared to the control explants. by the end of culture at day  <dig> the number of terminal end buds showed a gradual increase in lung cultured with day 40– <dig> milk and further, the terminal end buds increased by 86 h in embryonic lungs treated with day  <dig> milk when compared with control embryonic lung. mouse embryonic lung explants treated with day  <dig> milk had rudimentary branches and did not change during 4 days of culture . in contrast, explants treated with day  <dig> milk showed significant increases in branching of the main bronchus to form putative alveolar regions in the majority of the lung , and peripheral epithelial tubules showed a complex branching pattern in comparison with control explants. explants treated with day  <dig> milk  had small epithelial tubules with terminal end buds at peripheral regions. in lungs cultured in control media the majority of each explant was populated with long tubules with poor branching morphogenesis and the absence of epithelial sacs .figure  <dig>

to investigate whether there was a direct effect of tammar milk on lung mesenchyma, the isolated mesenchyma from e <dig> embryonic mouse lung was cultured for 3 days as a 3d explant in matrigel and treated with tammar milk . control mesenchymal explants, cultured in media with no milk proteins, initially aggregated and did not develop further exhibiting cell shrinkage indicative of necrotic cells after 3 days of culture . the mesenchyma treated with day  <dig> milk showed no growth and became condensed . the mesenchyma treated with day  <dig> milk showed morphological cell differentiation and proliferation and elongated mesenchymal cells invaded the matrigel . whole mount staining of these explants demonstrated the cells were flat, elongated and spindle shaped similar to either airway smooth muscle cells or myofibroblast cells derived from primary mesenchyma . mesenchymal explants treated with day  <dig> milk  were similar to control cultures  with cells failing to survive and condensing with apparent necrosis. whole mount staining of these explants indicated likely necrosis and a large reduction of cell population .

discussion
tammar lactation is programmed to potentially regulate lung development in pouch young by stimulating branching morphogenesis and growth
the tammar is born after a short gestation  and lungs are immature at birth with the majority of development occurring during early postnatal life  <cit> . the in depth analysis of tammar lung development described here showed fetal lungs were still at the canalicular stage of development during the final stages of gestation  similar to eutherian fetal rat at ~ e <dig> gestation  <cit> . the lungs at birth were at a transitional stage from a canalicular to saccular structure with the formation of primitive air sacs and most of the lung was comprised of mesenchyme tissue. in contrast, in the majority of eutherian species the lung develops prior to birth, while respiration is supported by the maternal placenta  <cit> . unlike eutherians, the marsupial newborn has immature organs, including the lung  <cit>  and most of their early development relies on factors supplied through milk  <cit> . interestingly, the delay in gut maturation is considered advantageous in neonatal mammals like marsupials, as their gastro-intestinal system is immature during early lactation and it has the capacity to absorb maternal proteins like immunoglobulins in milk through the gut  <cit> . indeed, absorption of macromolecules persists throughout most of pouch young life  <cit> . the current study examined whether marsupial tammar wallaby milk includes bioactives with the potential to stimulate branching morphogenesis in lung. mouse embryonic lungs were cultured with tammar milk protein and results showed a significant effect on branching morphogenesis and growth of lung explants treated with day  <dig> tammar milk.

analysis of the pattern of gene expression in the tammar wallaby mammary gland has shown that the majority of genes are differentially expressed during lactation  <cit> . moreover there is a gradual change in the number of milk proteins secreted across lactation with the potential to influence development and immune protection of pouch young  <cit> . previous studies have shown that transfer of tammar pouch young to a mother at a more advanced stage of lactation can specifically accelerate the rate of stomach development in pouch young  <cit>  and the current study is consistent with the hypothesis that tammar lactation may also be programmed to regulate postnatal lung development during early lactation after the first 40 days postpartum. the potential inhibitory effect of milk at day  <dig> on in vitro lung development correlates with the time when the early saccular phase of development is evident and the lung displays a slow rate of septal formation. this may result from milk that includes a negative regulator or potentially that the milk is lacking necessary signals for branching morphogenesis and increased lung volume. however, this observation correlates with the time when a significant proportion of respiration occurs through the skin of the pouch young  <cit> . in tammar pouch young the majority of lung development was observed around day  <dig> as the lung progressed from saccular stage to alveolar stage. during this process the septal crest density increased from ~ day  <dig> – ~ day  <dig> and was observed as the most active state of alveolarization in relation to growth of lung. at this time lungs progress from saccular to alveolar  stage although a significant increase in alveolar number was observed until the end of phase 2a . this profound increase in branching morphogenesis indicates the milk at day  <dig> – day  <dig> may have the necessary bioactivity to regulate lung development in pouch young and correlates with the timing of increased bioactivity of milk in the in vitro lung model. further, morphological changes observed in tammar pouch young lung after phase 2a lactation at day  <dig> clearly indicate a slow rate of development of septal density which is consistent with the effects induced by milk from day  <dig> and day  <dig> of lactation when there was very limited increase in terminal branches and growth in cultured mouse lungs.

rna analysis on mouse embryonic lung explants treated with milk from day  <dig>  day  <dig> and day  <dig> of lactation were analysed for expression of a group of marker genes to assess lung development in culture; surfactant proteins  and branching morphogenesis proteins . surfactant proteins sp-c and sp-b are the two major surfactant proteins expressed in the early developmental stage of the lung  <cit> . sp-c is involved in postnatal respiration  <cit>  and sp-b is involved in immune protection  <cit> . increased expression of these surfactant proteins in mouse lung explants treated with day  <dig> milk indicate that factors in milk were able to stimulate proliferation of type-ii epithelial cells and increase synthesis of surfactant proteins. expression of surfactant protein is essential for successful respiration in newborns and decreased expression of surfactant proteins may cause respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants  <cit> .

the early stage of lung development involves increased branching morphogenesis from the main bronchus to increase surface area for gaseous exchange  <cit> . expression of bmp- <dig> and wnt7b are involved in branching morphogenesis during embryonic lung development  <cit> . terminal end buds from the primary branches progress to terminal air sacs  <cit> , a process associated with increased epithelial cell proliferation  <cit> . tammar milk was shown to include bioactives that increase terminal end buds and signal epithelial cell proliferation and branching morphogenesis when cultured with lungs isolated from mouse embryos. a significant increase in terminal end buds was observed in lungs treated tammar milk collected specifically at day  <dig> - day  <dig> of lactation and the increase in the level of expression of the bmp- <dig> and wnt7b genes is consistent with tammar milk proteins activating branching morphogenesis. these data suggest that milk secreted during early lactation may have the potential to signal branching morphogenesis of altricial young in the pouch. escalated branching morphogenesis supports the increase of total volume of the lung providing the required area for lung alveolarization in later stages of development, which in turn provides required surface areas for respiration after birth. in addition, during this process in cultured embryonic lungs there are progenitor cells located in terminal end buds that can differentiate into epithelial cells in the alveolar and bronchial regions. expression of the id <dig> gene is a marker for these progenitor cells  <cit>  and expression of the id <dig> gene was increased in embryonic lungs treated with tammar milk day  <dig>  but not in lung explants treated with milk from early , late lactation and under control conditions. further, cell proliferation was higher in embryonic lung treated with day  <dig> milk and the increased rate of cell proliferation observed in mesenchyme in embryonic lungs treated with day  <dig> milk indicates that these changes most likely results from increased mesenchymal signalling factors.

tammar milk protein regulates the growth of mouse lung epithelium and mesenchyma
the current study showed a difference in the ratio of epithelium and mesenchyme in embryonic lung when treated with tammar milk protein collected from different time points. subsequent experiments showed that tammar milk stimulated epithelium and mesenchyma separately to regulate cell differentiation, proliferation and polarity of the cells. epithelial explants specifically treated with day  <dig> milk preparation developed a large lumen surrounded with a single layer of columnar epithelial cells. as mesenchymal-epithelial interactions are essential for epithelial branching morphogenesis  <cit> . the addition of day  <dig> milk stimulated the cell behaviour of a primitive mesenchyma, with an increase in cell proliferation and elongation of mesenchymal cells invading the surrounding matrigel. the role of day  <dig> milk in mesenchymal cell proliferation and differentiation is still unclear, however, observation of cells during culture showed they were flattened, elongated and spindle shaped, representing either airway smooth muscle cells or myofibroblast cells derived from primary mesenchyma  <cit> . a decrease in mesenchymal tissue can lead to a delay or prevention of epithelial branching during lung development  <cit> . in contrast, the treatment of lung with day  <dig> milk showed a reduced effect on epithelium and mesenchymal cell populations which is consistent with a similar effect observed when the whole embryonic lung was cultured in day  <dig> milk protein. therefore, factors in milk responsible for postnatal lung maturation were expressed from day  <dig> of lactation until the end of the early lactation period  and this temporal effect was lost in later phases of lactation . the timing of this stimulatory activity of milk on mouse embryo lungs is consistent with increased lung development in tammar neonates and reduced level of lung development after phase 2a lactation.

CONCLUSIONS
taken collectively the results presented in this study indicate that tammar milk can temporally regulate cell proliferation and differentiation of both epithelium and mesenchyma cell populations from lung. this concept of the timed presentation of milk bioactives to the young for lung development is consistent with the timed appearance of milk bioactives that regulate gut development in the young and protection of the young from infection  <cit> . this unique model may offer new opportunities for the identification of signalling molecules that are presented to the marsupial young at a time that correlates with prenatal presentation of signalling factors by the placenta and amniotic fluid for the development of a range of tissues during eutherian foetal development.
