BACKGROUND
madin-darby canine kidney  cells are the best established mammalian model for studying epithelial cell biology. mdck cells differentiate into polarized cells within a few days when grown on semi-permeable filter supports. the cells form an epithelial monolayer, with tight junctions separating an apical surface from a basolateral membrane facing the filter support and neighbouring cells. both surfaces have a unique composition of proteins and lipids  <cit> . newly synthesized secretory proteins are sorted in the trans-golgi network and from there transported to the apical and basolateral surfaces. sorting of proteins to the basolateral surface often relies on proteinaceous signals in cytoplasmically exposed domains of the protein. association with lipid rafts and glycosylation have been proposed to be involved in apical targeting  <cit> .

as marker proteins of the apical and basolateral plasma membrane of mdck cells we have previously raised monoclonal antibodies recognizing two membrane glycoproteins. the apical marker protein gp <dig> is a highly glycosylated integral membrane protein with an apparent molecular weight of  <dig> kda  <cit> . the basolateral marker protein has been termed p <dig> according to apparent molecular weight. in subconfluent monolayers of mdck cells, p <dig> localizes to both the basolateral and the apical surface, but later disappears from the apical surface, concomitantly with the development of a tight monolayer  <cit> .

the proteomic identification of membrane proteins of mdck cells, especially when highly glycosylated, still presents a considerable challenge. first, it is rather difficult to isolate these proteins in sufficient amounts. second, the canine genome is only partially available and est sequences do not adequately cover its proteome. conventional methods of database searching rely heavily on matching masses of intact peptides  or their fragments  to the corresponding masses obtained by in silico processing of protein sequences from database entries  <cit> . stringent matching of computed and measured masses increases the specificity and the speed of database searching considerably, yet restricts the reach of proteomics methodologies down to a handful of favourably covered model species  <cit> . recently developed methods of mass spectrometry driven sequence similarity searches  <cit>  utilize redundant, degenerate and partially inaccurate peptide sequences, produced by de novo interpretation of tandem mass spectra and are capable of identifying distant homologues of known proteins from phylogenetically distant organisms  <cit> .

in this work we applied immunoaffinity chromatography to enrich the heavily glycosylated membrane proteins gp <dig> and p <dig> and identify them by tandem mass spectrometry and homology driven proteomics.

RESULTS
enrichment of gp <dig> by immunoaffinity chromatography
our first approach was based on the glycoprotein properties of gp <dig>  <cit> . a membrane fraction of mdck cells was enriched for glycoproteins by lectin affinity chromatography using wheat germ agglutinin. the  <dig> kda region of the gel electrophoresis pattern  was analyzed by mass spectrometry. six peptides matched canine intercellular adhesion molecule  <dig> . other proteins identified were not apical proteins . a few peptides from low abundant spectra could not be assigned to any protein. antibodies against dog icam- <dig> immunoprecipitated a  <dig> kda protein, but this protein was not recognized by antibodies against gp <dig> . therefore we concluded that gp <dig> is a protein different from icam- <dig> 

immunoaffinity columns established with mouse anti gp <dig> igg were used for a more efficient enrichment of gp <dig>  detergent soluble membrane protein fractions were applied to immunoaffinity columns, and the eluted fractions concentrated by methanol-chloroform extraction-precipitation. surprisingly, gp <dig> did not partition with other proteins, but remained in the aqueous phase, probably due to its high glycosylation . gel electrophoresis followed by coomassie blue staining revealed a single faint band corresponding to gp <dig> . in parallel, gp <dig> was first immunoprecipitated and then enzymatically deglycosylated since we anticipated that the high amount of glycosylation might affect the efficiency of tryptic digestion prior to the analysis by mass spectrometry .

identification of gp <dig> by mass spectrometry
the maldi tof spectrum of a tryptic digest of the gp <dig> band contained only two peptide signals, which is a surprisingly low number for a protein of this size . since maldi and electrospray spectra acquired from the same digest usually demonstrate different peptide profiles  <cit> , the digest was further investigated by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry . the mascot database search with uninterpreted tandem mass spectra gave only three matches to immunoglobulin peptides, although  <dig> precursor ions were fragmented. the major peptide peaks in the spectrum remained unassigned. therefore the unmatched tandem mass spectra were manually interpreted de novo by considering mass differences between adjacent peaks of fragment ions . this approach only rendered low confidence amino acid sequences since it is not known if the considered ions indeed belong to the same fragment series  <cit> . furthermore, spectra from multiply charged precursor ions contained non-overlapping fragment series with different charge states, which did not cover the complete peptide sequence. therefore the interpretation of each spectrum produced several inaccurate, partially redundant and incomplete peptide sequence proposals . we then merged peptide sequence candidates obtained by the interpretation of all good quality tandem mass spectra into a single search string and employed the mass spectrometry-driven blast  protocol for the identification of proteins by sequence similarity searching  <cit> . the database search confidently hit proteins of the carcinoembryonic antigen  protein family . the table shows only the first protein homologue of the database search, carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule  <dig> , but other cea family proteins gave the same alignment with an identical score. remarkably, not a single alignment covered the corresponding sequence completely. the conservation of gp <dig> across species is apparently not sufficient for an identification by cross-species matching of acquired tandem mass spectra matching using mascot software  <cit> .

in silico analysis of gp114
the cea protein family consists of two separate branches, the membrane associated ceacam proteins and the soluble pregnancy-specific glycoproteins . the ceacam proteins are extensively spliced yielding numerous isoforms. in addition, some ceacam proteins are modified to include a glycophosphatidylinositol  anchor instead of a transmembrane domain . gp <dig> is an integral membrane protein  and belongs therefore to the ceacam subgroup.

ms blast searches could only be performed against a protein database. once gp <dig> had been identified as a canine ceacam protein, we used the human ceacam <dig> nucleotide sequence to search for homologous genes. one genomic sequence  contained an exon sequence homologous to human ceacam <dig>  five of the sequenced peptides could be matched exactly to this translated exon sequence . other canine genomic sequences homologous to human ceacam <dig> were either identical to fe <dig> or did not match the sequenced peptides. thus identical peptides identified in the dog genome validated the sequence similarity identification by ms blast. one of the peptides  had also been detected in our first analysis of lectin bound  <dig> kda proteins, but could not be assigned at that time. this confirmed that gp <dig> was indeed present in the lectin bound  <dig> kda fraction, but could not be identified on the basis of a single peptide sequence.

while this manuscript was under evaluation, the canine genome became publicly available  <cit> . a tentative amino acid sequence was obtained  which was significantly similar to human ceacam family proteins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  ceacam  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are gpi anchored proteins which have been reported to be expressed in humans only  <cit> . furthermore, the predicted molecular weights of the mature proteins  are  <dig> kda for human ceacam <dig>   <dig> kda for ceacam  <dig> and  <dig> kda for ceacam  <dig> and  <dig>  only the molecular weight of human ceacam <dig> corresponds reasonably to the size of deglycosylated gp <dig>  <cit> . deglycosylated gp <dig>  gave the same two characteristic fragments as the untreated protein by maldi tof analysis . other names for ceacam <dig> are biliary glycoprotein, bgp <dig>  tm-cea and cd66a  <cit> . in summary, gp <dig> is a dog ceacam protein, most likely ceacam <dig> 

properties of canine ceacam/gp114
apical sorting of gp114/canine ceacam occurs directly to the surface with a half time of  <dig> minutes  <cit> . the glycans are of the n-glycosylated complex type containing sialic acid, contributing about half of the apparent molecular weight of gp <dig>  <cit> . however, in mdck-rca cells deficient in terminal glycosylation due to an inactivated udp-galactose transporter  <cit> , gp <dig> was missorted to the basolateral surface, whereas targeting of other apical proteins was not affected. furthermore, endocytosis of gp <dig> is also highly increased in these cells compared to a very slow internalization in mdck wild type cells  <cit> . independently, gp <dig> was identified as a major protein undergoing bidirectional transcytosis in mdck-rca cells  <cit> . antibody crosslinking shows that gp <dig> coclusters with lipid raft associated proteins in the apical membrane of mdck cells  <cit> .

lipid raft microdomain association and glycosylation dependent trafficking  have not been reported for ceacam proteins so far. reversible association with lipid microdomains has been put forward as a core mechanism in the regulation of signal transduction at the plasma membrane  <cit> . our identification enables the integration of the data obtained for gp <dig> with the characterization of ceacam proteins from other approaches.

identification of p58
the p <dig> protein was enriched by immunoaffinity chromatography, similarly to gp <dig>  the trypsin digested band of p <dig> was identified as the β-chain of canine na+k+-atpase by peptide mass fingerprinting.  <dig> peptides were matched to the masses of corresponding tryptic peptides with better than  <dig> ppm mass tolerance. the mowse score of  <dig> exceeded the significance threshold of  <dig> and thus the identification was considered confident.

the β-subunit of na+k+-atpase contains three n-linked glycans, which is consistent with the apparent molecular weight of the expressed protein. the association of the β-subunit with the α-subunit is required for the enzyme complex to reach the plasma membrane . the polarized expression of na+k+-atpase in epithelia depends on the association of β-subunits from neighbouring cells  <cit> . the molecular weight of the α-subunit corresponds to the protein coprecipitating with p <dig> antibodies under non-denaturing conditions . na+k+-atpase has also been used in other cell systems as a basolateral marker protein.

ms identification of proteins from organisms with unsequenced genomes
mass spectrometry driven sequence similarity searches now make it possible to characterize proteins from model organisms with unsequenced genomes by their similarity to already available sequences. computational simulations suggested that almost all proteins within mammalian phylogenetic lineage could be identified by ms blast sequence similarity searches using  <dig> sequenced tryptic peptides, which is a rather frequent outcome of tandem mass spectrometric experiments  <cit> . importantly, the method imposes rather loose requirements on the quality of peptide sequences and thus paves the way to complete automation of the analytical routine. mass spectrometric characterization of unknown proteins can be performed in a layered approach  <cit>  i.e. conventional proteomics methods could be applied first to identify highly conserved proteins that share identical peptide sequences with their known homologues, and sequence similarity searches would only be applied to a selection of non-conserved proteins once the conventional methods failed. thus we might anticipate that the scope of proteomics methods will be able to support biochemical research in any vertebrate model.

CONCLUSIONS
the apical marker glycoprotein gp <dig> has been enriched from tissue culture cells and identified by tandem mass spectrometry as canine carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule . we exemplify the difficulties associated with identifying glycoproteins from model systems without sequenced genomes, and how to overcome them. the general strategy provides a framework which should be useful for many related approaches.

known properties of gp <dig> such as glycosylation dependent transcytosis and association with lipid microdomains involved in signal transduction can now be integrated with the knowledge about ceacam proteins obtained by different approaches.
