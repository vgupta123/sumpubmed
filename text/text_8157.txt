BACKGROUND
the order chlamydiales evolved from their free-living ancestors about 500– <dig> million years ago   <cit> , establishing their intracellular life in lower eukaryotes. their life cycle consists of infectious elementary bodies and intracellularly replicative reticulate bodies  was not a driving force in the evolution of the chlamydiales; less than  <dig> % of the total gene number was estimated to result from hgt  <cit> . instead, while adapting to the homeostatic niche within their specific hosts, all chlamydiaceae species reduced their genome size to little more than  <dig> mb. at least  <dig> % of the genes in any sequenced chlamydiaceae genome represent orthologs with other chlamydiaceae species  <cit> . despite this high level of functional conservation, chlamydiae differ in their host spectrum, tissue tropism and spectrum of host diseases resulting from the infection.

chlamydophila pneumoniae deserves medical attention as an important respiratory pathogen causing about  <dig> % of community acquired pneumonias and upper respiratory tract infections like bronchitis, pharyngitis and sinusitis  <cit> . virtually every person is believed to be infected at least once during their lifetime. serological evidence indicates that infections start to occur during childhood and  <dig> –  <dig> % of the population has been exposed by  <dig> years of age  <cit> . viable chlamydiae have been isolated from atherosclerotic plaques, implicating a causal role in the development of atherosclerosis  <cit> . blood monocytes are believed to be the vector system within the systemic circulation  <cit> . moreover, c. pneumoniae has been isolated in the brain and is associated with alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis  <cit> .

in contrast to c. trachomatis, no biovars or pathotypes have been described so far for c. pneumoniae, despite of the broad range of disease associations and sites of infection. the genomic sequences of the four isolates ar- <dig>  cwl- <dig>  j <dig> and tw- <dig> show a remarkable level of gene conservation and synteny. overall identity between isolates is > 99%  <cit> . the genomes of the four isolates comprise an equivalent set of coding sequences and differ only by a small number of insertions and deletions and several single nucleotide polymorphisms . analyses of repeated sequences suggested that c. pneumoniae has the highest potential for recombination among fully sequenced chlamydiaceae and that the majority of recombination hotspots of the c. pneumoniae genome are concentrated in a family of polymorphic proteins  <cit> . the high degree of conservation is in line with the low rate of hgt as well as a low frequency of genome rearrangements within the species, owing to the unique chlamydial biology and ecological isolation within the intracellular niche. therefore, point mutations, fixed in the population and accumulating with time, are the major source of genetic variability in c. pneumoniae hence snps are among the most sensitive phylogenetic markers to reconstruct the evolutionary history of this species. snps occur as two classes of substitutions within genes, referred to as synonymous and non-synonymous snps . nssnps result in amino acid replacement and are targets of evolutionary selection. ssnps make a difference with respect to the codon usage but do not alter the protein sequence and are therefore evolutionary almost neutral. this qualifies ssnps as a valuable target for population genetic studies. snps have been successfully used to reconstruct the phylogeny of the m. tuberculosis complex  <cit>  and b. anthracis isolates  <cit> . in the present study, we analysed snps of c. pneumoniae to answer questions about the homology of geographically and anatomically different isolates and the existence of distinguishable genotypes. we first conducted an in silico analysis of ssnps and nssnps of the four sequenced c. pneumoniae isolates. to reduce the potential ascertainment bias caused by deriving the snp events from a limited set of only four completely sequenced genomes, the snps selected for sequencing should be as independent as possible. compared to non-coding and non-synonymous snps, synonymous snps provide evolutionary almost neutral, abundant and equally distributed sequence markers in the c. pneumoniae genomes. we therefore chose a representative subset of  <dig> ssnps and analysed the loci in  <dig> c. pneumoniae isolates. as chlamydiae are difficult to propagate the available collection is the largest that has even been analysed. by this approach, we were able to gain new insights into the genetic diversity, the population structure and evolutionary history of c. pneumoniae.

RESULTS
snp-analysis of the reference strains
comparative genome analysis of the four sequenced reference strains revealed a total of  <dig> snps within the  <dig>  mega base genome. the ratio of transitions:transversions has been determined at  <dig> : <dig> for synonymous snps,  <dig> : <dig> for nonsynonymous snps, 1:  <dig>  for snps in intergenic regions and 1: <dig> for rna genes. snps of all classes were homogeneously distributed over the whole genome . no mutational hot spot could be identified. the number of snps per gene did not exceed  <dig>  there was no functional class of genes that accumulated more snps than average . the individual genes that contains snps were provided in additional file  <dig>  table  <dig> specifies the number of different snps identifying certain isolates. j- <dig> was the most unique isolate. the number of nssnps exceeded that of ssnps by a ratio of  <dig> : <dig>  given the same mutation probability for all positions and the absence of any selection pressure, we calculated a nssnp/ssnp ratio of  <dig> : <dig> being the null hypothesis.

phylogeny of c. pneumoniae
a comparison of the evolutionary relation between the four isolates revealed a phylogenetic proximity between cwl- <dig> and tw- <dig>  and ar- <dig> and j- <dig>  respectively . the topology of this evolutionary tree was not significantly altered when ssnp, nssnp or snp of intergenic regions were analysed separately . ssnps were not able to resolve the common branch of cwl- <dig> and tw- <dig> . in a second attempt, we tried to find a valuable outgroup in order to unravel the tree topology of the c. pneumoniae complex. from multiple blast search it appeared that c. abortus is the closest published genome to c. pneumoniae, though being rather distant . using different phylogenetic reconstructions  we obtained the same tree topologies where the animal isolates are basal and the human isolates are derived, suggesting a zoonosis scenario for c. pneumoniae . however, these results have to be taken with caution, since this topology was only weakly supported  with the exception of the ar-39-j- <dig> clade. due to the limited number of only two available animal isolates, the effect of long-branch attraction  cannot be excluded for this part of the tree. nevertheless, the consistent topology derived by parsimony and distance methods lba seems not to be the most probable explanation.

the phylogeny of  <dig> c. pneumoniae isolates based on  <dig> ssnps is shown in figure  <dig>  the tree shows four distinguishable clusters. the animal isolates of the african frog  and australian koala form one cluster. the iranian ocular isolate iol- <dig> and the three indistinguishable isolates tw- <dig> , a- <dig>  and uzg <dig>  have likely evolved from a common ancestor and form a second cluster. cluster iii is represented by the two japanese isolates j- <dig> and yk- <dig> and two u.s. isolates ar- <dig> and cm- <dig>  cluster iv is the biggest and contains  <dig> isolates. isolates within this cluster differ in  <dig> snps at most. the four finnish isolates  form a distinct subcluster. within the remaining closely related isolates,  <dig> isolates are identical by snp analysis and are termed the cwl- <dig> group. this group contains mainly respiratory and cardiovascular isolates as well as those from peripheral blood monocytes. all isolates except the u.s. respiratory isolates cwl- <dig> and w- <dig> are of european origin. one cardiovascular isolate  differs from the other european cardiovascular isolates by one snp. the u.s. isolates cwl- <dig>  cwl- <dig> and w- <dig> can be differentiated from the cwl- <dig> group by one to two isolate specific snps. five swedish isolates were included into the study. they all are closely related, but only al- <dig> and u- <dig> are located indistinguishable in the cwl- <dig> group. t- <dig> differs by one snp from u- <dig>  u- <dig> and u- <dig>  which are identical to each other, differ by two additional snps from the cwl- <dig> group. the split between the main c. pneumoniae lineages is rather young; for example the mean number of mutations between the ancestral cluster i  and cluster iv is  <dig>   mutations, this translates into  <dig> % sequence divergence, which suggests that these two lineages separated some  <dig>  years ago. this analysis is based on the e. coli clock rate. we are aware that the evolutionary clock of obligate intracellular organisms might run faster; that would even reduce the calculated age of clades.

demographic history
we computed frequencies of pairwise differences between the large cluster iv haplotypes  to evaluate the hypothesis of recent population growth in c. pneumomiae . the distribution of nucleotide differences between pairs of haplotypes shows the typical unimodal shape of a population having passed through a recent demographic expansion  <cit>  and fits a sudden expansion model . based on the stepwise expansion model, the effective population size of this lineage increased by a factor of  <dig>  . assuming a synonymous mutation rate  of  <dig> × 10- <dig> per nucleotide per year and a τ-value of  <dig>  , the expansion event took place about  <dig>  years ago.

genotyping of c. pneumoniae
snp data revealed to be useful to genotype new c. pneumoniae isolates and to allocate them to the described clusters. a subset of ssnps was defined that discriminates between the genotypes. additional file  <dig> gives an algorithm for the identification of different c. pneumoniae isolates. a total of  <dig> different snps  are sufficient to identify these isolates or to relate a new isolate to the characterized ones.

discussion
the evolutionary tree of the  <dig> c. pneumoniae isolates based on  <dig> ssnps displays the genetic variability of the species. the topology ot the phylogenetic tree of the four reference isolates  is reflected within the tree. there are four major clusters within the tree and  <dig> different c. pneumoniae genotypes can be defined by the ssnp analysis.

of all reported studies, this is the highest discriminative analysis of genetic diversity in c. pneumoniae and ssnps have proven useful to differentiate between c. pneumoniae isolates. nevertheless, it is most intriguing that even with this sensitive marker we were not able to differentiate  <dig> out of  <dig> isolates that originated from different european and american origins and anatomical localisations. this is evidence for a highly clonal population structure and advocates for a recent origin of this bacterial species. results are in line with the expected widespread homologous recombination in c. pneumoniae.

the genetic clusters do not separate between geographic or anatomical origin of the isolates, even if the finnish isolates form a distinct subcluster. isolates that infect the blood or the vasculature cannot be separated from respiratory isolates, thus we hypothesize that they are not genetically different lineages and are rather young. we calculated that the expansion event in cluster iv took place about  <dig>  years ago or even more recently assuming a faster clock rate in intracellular bacteriae. nevertheless, vascular and pbmc isolates have been shown to possess a single copy of the tyrp gene while respiratory isolates have multiple copies. a single tyrp copy only has been proposed to improve the propensity for vascular infection and persistence  <cit> . we conclude that the multiplication of the tyrp gene might have occurred after the emergence of the genotypes defined by snps. moreover, the identiy of vascular and respirotory isolates in the ssnp analysis does not exclude the possibility of different pathotypes, as ssnps have no phenotypic correlate. to further study genotype-phenotype correlation, non-synonymous polymorphisms would be more suitable. given the clonal population structure demonstrated in this study, we assume that polymorphisms defining potential pathotypes can be discovered only by the most sensitive techniques, e.g. the sequence analysis of the whole genome.

we are aware that this ssnp analysis only provides limited information on the species phylogeny and may be biased by the ascertainment of the sequenced snps. the snps we chose for analysis were identified by four reference isolates. this approach includes an inherent bias, as additional snps of other isolates remain unconsidered. the most likely effect of this bias could be a branch collapse and the underestimation of the evolutionary distance. however, we are convinced that the impact of this bias is limited by the fact that the reference isolates come from distant locations, and, thus, represent different genotypic lineages. tw- <dig> is an ocular strain obtained in taiwan in  <dig>  ar- <dig> was isolated from a patient with acute respiratory symptoms in seattle, usa in  <dig>  cwl- <dig> was isolated from a pneumonia patient in atlanta, usa in  <dig>  j- <dig> was obtained from a boy with pharyngitis in japan in  <dig>  this assumption is supported by the fact that each identified cluster, with the exception of the animal isolates, includes one reference isolate and no distant outgroups occurred. additionally, when we sequenced about  <dig> % of the genome, we did not identify novel snps in human strains that were absent in the reference strains. in contrast, we detected  <dig> new ssnps between animal and human isolates. extrapolating from the  <dig>  mega bases sequenced, one can speculate, that about  <dig> additional ssnps could be found in the whole genome. thus, we believe that the evolutionary distance between animal and human strains is highly underestimated in this tree .

the major phylogenetic finding is that animal c. pneumoniae isolates from african frog and australian koala cluster closely together and differ distinctly from human isolates. highest homologies outside the species are found with c. abortus, a ruminant pathogen that also possess the ability to infect humans. further analysis showed that the animal isolates are basal and the human isolates are derived. we, thus, hypothesized that c. pneumoniae evolved from an animal pathogen and the c. pneumoniae animal isolates are the ancestors of human isolates. two previous studies analysing the 16s rrna gene, the 16s/23s intergenic spacer and domain i of the 23s gene supports this hypothesis: a c. pneumoniae isolate from a horse clustered different from human isolates that were derived  <cit> . the split between the lineages in our study occured in recent history, about  <dig>  years ago. while spread and mixture of human isolates by migration and travel could explain their genetic similarity, it is extremely unlikely, that australian koala and african frog were able to exchange the intracellular parasite. thus, it is most intriguing that both isolates differ by only two snps despite the long period of evolutionary isolation. we interpret this as evidence for highly clonal population structure as a consequence of a very conserved genome. additionally, we speculate that the transition into the human or animal population represents an evolutionary bottleneck that contributed to the clonal population structure. a similar evolutionary history was proposed for m tuberculosis based on the conservation of point mutations and deletions  <cit> .

when we analysed the four sequenced genomes in silico, a first remarkable finding was that the abundance of nssnps exceeded that of ssnps . in an environment of strong selective pressure one could expect that the number of ssnps would exceed the number of nssnps because the latter are purged from the population by purifying selection. to solve this apparent contradiction we determined the likelihood for a single nucleotide exchange to cause a nssnp or ssnp for the cwl- <dig> genome. absence of any selection would result in a ratio of  <dig> : <dig> between nssnps and ssnps. thus, the reduced number of observed nssnp in comparison to the theoretically expected one is evidence for strong selective pressure within the intracellular niche.

we further found that all snps are homogeneously distributed around the genome . in this respect, c. pneumoniae differs from c. trachomatis, which shows a significant amount of genetic variation between serovars within the "plasticity zone" around the origin of replication  <cit> . no class of genes  could be identified that showed more snps than the average . this finding correlates with the low number of recent hgt events reported for the c. pneumoniae species  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have shown that ssnps are a sensitive tool to reveal the genetic diversity and past demography of c. pneumoniae that remained undetected by other methods. analysing a good portion of the worldwide available isolates, we were able to divide c. pneumoniae into different genotypes. nevertheless, a lack of detectable variation in some isolates emphasizes the extraordinary genetic conservation of this species and the high clonality of the population. high selection pressure within the intracellular niche and an evolutionary bottleneck as a consequence of the adaptation to the human or animal host might have contributed to the stability of the genome.
