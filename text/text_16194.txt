BACKGROUND
the transcriptome analysis studies of the past decade revealed that only a small proportion of mammalian genomes  is transcribed into protein coding mrnas  <cit> . the remaining non-coding part of the genome on the other hand is extensively transcribed into various classes of non-coding rnas. among them small regulatory rnas, such as micrornas and sirnas, have been extensively studied. however, the largest fraction of the non-coding transcriptome is represented by long non-coding rnas , which are defined as transcripts having size larger than  <dig> nucleotides  <cit> . this vast class of non-coding rnas still remains poorly understood and its functionality continues to be a subject of debate. however, evidence is growing that many lncrnas are important functional molecules involved in various regulatory processes. the functional lncrnas demonstrate precise spatiotemporal patterns of expression and often exhibit specific cellular localization  <cit> . so far, lncrnas have been shown to be associated with various biological and pathological processes, such as cell differentiation  <cit> , embryonic development  <cit> , immune response  <cit> , and cancer  <cit> . several insights have been gained into molecular mechanisms of lncrna activity, specifically some lncrnas have been shown to regulate gene expression by chromatin remodeling  <cit> , modulation of transcription factors  <cit> , translation  <cit> , and rna stability  <cit> . lncrna genes are often arranged into complex transcriptional loci with the protein coding genes, from which they are expressed in a coordinated fashion  <cit> . such complex loci may include overlapping architecture, such as cis-antisense, intronic, bidirectional, as well as non-overlapping with genes located in their close vicinity. some lncrna genes associated with protein-coding genes on genomic level encode lncrnas cooperating with proteins on the transcriptome and proteome levels. a number of studies have demonstrated functional relationship between lncrnas and their associated protein coding genes  <cit> . several recent reports focused on predicting functions of lncrnas from their co-localization with protein coding genes applying integrated analysis of transcriptome  <cit> . the present work extends the previous studies by detailing both characterization of lncrna genomic architecture types and their relation to dynamics of lncrna transcripts.

we investigated expression of lncrnas during differentiation of sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cell line induced by retinoic acid . using our custom microarray chip, for the first time we measured the dynamics of lncrna expression in this model system of neuronal differentiation. the most detailed of existing annotations of lncrna genomic architecture allowed us to discriminate  <dig> lncrna classes and to evaluate expression dynamics for each individual class. we integrated this data with our previous work on dynamics of protein expression measured at the same conditions to identify potential architecture-dependent regulatory mechanisms coupling expression of lncrnas and neighboring proteins.

RESULTS
classification of lncrna genes
lncrnas were identified among the genes of human genome build  <dig> annotated in h-invitational database  <cit> . absence of coding regions in the genes was verified using critica software, a hybrid method that combines comparative analysis with statistical analysis of coding sequences  <cit> . the final list included  <dig>  lncrna genes .

the genes were further classified by their association with neighbouring protein-coding genes by genomic architecture . the closest protein coding genes in sense or antisense orientation within  <dig> kbp vicinity of the lncrna genes were identified as associated with particular lncrnas. the associated lncrna-protein coding gene pairs were further classified by their ga into five major groups: antisense, intergenic, promoter-associated and intronic, relative to the protein-coding genes. each group was sub-classified, yielding in total  <dig> classes of lncrna-protein gene association types . antisense pairs were sub-classified into embedding, exonic, head-to-head and tail-to-tail classes. intergenic pairs were sub-classified into upstream-associated and downstream-associated. each of these two classes was further classified by the respective intergenic distance into three subclasses:  <dig> kbp,  <dig> kbp and  <dig> kbp. being of a of particular interest, the pairs sharing bidirectional promoters were similarly sub-classified into  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> kbp - distant. the exonic pairs were sub-classified into purely exonic and embedding. the latter class included cases when lncrna genes were located within the genomic boundaries of the associated proteins and, at the same time, were overlapping with both exonic and intronic sequences. embedding, exonic and intronic pairs were sub-classified into sense and antisense subtypes, relative to the protein-coding gene.

in total,  <dig>  lncrna genes were found to be associated with protein coding genes, according to the above criteria. among them the fractions of intergenic, intronic, antisense and promoter-associated lncrna genes were 49%, 29%, 15% and 7%, respectively .

surprisingly, gene ontology  analysis revealed evidence that the architecture of lncrna-protein coding gene pairs may be related to functional specialization of the proteins in these pairs. the list of significantly enriched gos specific to certain architecture types included genes associated with cell differentiation, embryogenesis, signalling pathways, and cytoskeleton. for more details, see section  <dig>  of the additional file  <dig> 

differential expression of lncrnas and associated protein coding genes
to measure the expression of protein coding gene-associated lncrnas during neuroblastoma differentiation, a custom microarray chip was designed and implemented using agilent platform. two biological replicates of differentiating neuroblastoma cells were screened at four time points  after a single-time stimulation by ra. confirming previous studies, the overall expression values of lncrnas were observed to be lower than the values of mrnas .

the distribution of all differentially expressed lncrnas revealed an increase in the fraction of transcripts with antisense ga from 18% to 22% . significant increase was observed for lncrnas with antisense head-to-head ga relative to that with intronic ,  <dig> kbp-distant bidirectional promoter ,  <dig> kbp-distant downstream-associated ,  <dig> kbp-distant intergenic downstream , and promoter-associated  gas . intronic antisense lncrna were over-represented in comparison with intronic  and promoter-associated  lncrnas. these observations are consistent with the well-known fact that pairs of complementary transcripts may regulate the stability of their counterparts  <cit> .

next, we tested whether the influence of lncrna ga is specific to differential expression of lncrnas or whether it might be related with the expression of the associated protein coding genes. therefore, differentially expressed lncrnas associated with differentially expressed protein coding genes were compared with all the differentially expressed lncrnas, as well as with those that correlate insignificantly with the associated protein coding genes. to identify possible functional connections between the lncrnas and their associated protein coding genes, in the cases when the expression of the lncrna-protein pairs correlate over time, ga frequencies were evaluated separately.

contrary to the general tendency of differentially expressed lncrnas, the fraction of antisense gas in positively correlating lncrna-protein coding gene pairs decreased from 12% to 5% . the ratios between the individual antisense ga frequencies in all differentially expressed lncrnas and those lncrnas that positively correlatewith expression of protein coding genes were  <dig>  for intronic,  <dig>  for exonic,  <dig>  for tail-to-tail and  <dig>  for head-to-head architectures. in comparison with intronic architecture, the differences were strongly significant . in contrast, among negatively correlating lncrna-protein coding genes pairs the frequency of intronic, exonic, tail-to-tail and head-to-head antisense gas was  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> -times higher. except for the head-to-head ga, the fraction of the antisense architecture types was higher in negatively correlating lncrnas in comparison with all differentially expressed lncrna-protein coding pairs. the results suggest that antisense mode of architecture-dependent regulation for lncrnas is largely negative. go analysis of the protein-coding genes postitively correlating with their paired lncrna genes did not reveal significant associations with biologcal functions specific to any given architecture.

to find whether the observed correlations between the expression levels of lncrnas and protein coding genes are specific to certain temporal expression patterns, we analyzed their dynamics in the course of ra-induced cell differentiation.

dynamical modes of lncrna expression
expression of lncrnas and protein coding genes was analyzed at four time points in the course of ra-induced neuroblastoma cells differentiation. dynamical patterns  of lncrna expression were discriminated: i) by the time point when a given lncrna activation/repression is observed  and ii) by the time interval of increased/decreased expression of a given lncrna . these two types of modes were named as "rate" and "magnitude", respectively. analysis of the "rate" modes revealed that most of the studied lncrnas were either activated or repressed already by hour six of cell differentiation and followed such trend until the end of the experiment . these two modes together comprised 52% of the differentially expressed lncrnas.

the largest increase in the frequency of mode occurrence was observed for the lncrnas repressed by  <dig> h, followed by the ones activated by  <dig> h. among the differentially expressed lncrnas associated with the differentially expressed protein coding genes the frequencies of these modes were  <dig> -times higher than those among the all differentially expressed lncrnas. lncrnas transiently activated at 6h and permanently activated by  <dig> h were the other two classes whose frequency was higher among the protein-associated differentially expressed lncrnas,  <dig> - and  <dig> -times, respectively. the largest frequency decrease  was observed among lncrnas permanently repressed by  <dig> h, followed by the ones activated by  <dig> h. the above tendencies were more clear when the protein coding gene-associated differentially expressed lncrnas had been classified into positively and negatively correlating. for positively-correlating lncrna genes the mode with the largest fraction increase  was repression by  <dig> h, followed by the mode of permanent activation by  <dig> h. at the same time, the fraction of lncrnas activated by  <dig> h, as well as permanently repressed by  <dig> h further decreased,  <dig> - and  <dig> -times, respectively.

surprisingly, the modes with the highest increase among the positively-correlating lncrnas were strongly under-represented among the negatively correlating lncrnas and vice-versa. as such, for the negatively correlating lncrnas, the fraction of lncrnas activated by  <dig> h increased  <dig> -times, and those permanently repressed by  <dig> h increased  <dig> -times. on the contrary, the fraction of lncrnas permanently activated by  <dig> h decreased  <dig> -times, while lncrnas activated by  <dig> h were completely absent. also, the frequency of lncrnas transiently activated at  <dig> h increased  <dig> -times.

analysis of the "magnitude" modes confirmed and further clarified the dynamic patterns described above . among all differentially expressed lncrnas the most frequent modes were "decreased expression by  <dig> h"  and "increased expression by  <dig> h" . overall, protein-associated differentially expressed lncrnas revealed an increase in the increased-expression modes: upregulation by  <dig> h , upregulation by  <dig> h , transiently upregulated during 6- <dig> h , upregulation by  <dig> h . on the contrary, a reduction in the fraction of decreased expression modes was observed. the most notable was a  <dig> -times decrease for the lncrnas with down regulation by  <dig> h and by  <dig> h. except for the lncrnas with decreased expression by  <dig> h, the distribution of "magnitude" modes in general reflected the distribution of the "rate" modes.

similarly, when the differentially expressed lncrnas positively correlating with their associated protein coding genes were compared with those of all the protein coding gene-associated differentially expressed lncrnas, a further rise in the fraction of the increased-expression modes was observed. namely, for the fractions of lncrnas with increased expression by  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h the increase was  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -times, respectively. the fraction of lncrnas with transiently increased expression between  <dig> h and  <dig> h increased  <dig> -times. at the same time, for most of the downregulated expression modes a decrease in their fraction among the positively correlating lncrnas was observed. the only exception were lncrnas with decreased expression by  <dig> h. their fraction increased  <dig> -times. for lncrnas positively correlating with their associated protein coding genes, compared to all differentially expressed lncrnas, the frequency of transcripts activated by  <dig> h increased  <dig> -times, while the frequency of transcripts activated by  <dig> h and  <dig> h decreased  <dig> - and  <dig> -times, respectively. the opposite was observed for the repressed lncrnas. the fraction of lncrnas repressed by  <dig> h decreased  <dig> -times, while the fraction of lncrnas repressed by  <dig> h increased  <dig> -times. see additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> for more details.

since the listed differences were strongly statistically significant, the results suggest that ga is linked with lncrnas positive correlation with the protein coding gene counterparts if the former are induced, or negative correlation if the former are repressed. we also observed that early induced  lncrnas tend to be positively correlating with the associated protein coding genes, linked with their induction, while late induction of the lncrnas more often occurs for lncrnas negatively correlating with the associated protein coding genes, linked with their repression.

go analysis revealed that the positively correlating gene pairs activated by  <dig> h were significantly enriched in muscle development genes , represented by the hox  and pdlim  family members, phosphoprotein phoshpatases , and a transcription repressor tmf <dig> . three of these genes  were also associated with actin cytoskeleton. this go category was significantly enriched among the  <dig> h-activated positively correlating gene pairs . two annotated protein-coding genes associated with negatively correlating lncrnas transiently repressed at  <dig> h, were pura and polr2f. it resulted in a significant gene enrichment for general transcription from rna polymerase ii promoter go  for this group of genes. lncrna genes exhibiting repressive expression rate modes did not reveal any significant gos .

when differential expression was considered regardless the significance of correlation, significant gos were obsereved for a few more expression patterns. the results below describe the ontologies of protein-coding genes associated with a given type of dynamics of their lncrna coding neighbors. analysis of expression rate and magnitude modes demonstrated several waves of functionally specialized lncrna gene expression. the first wave  permanently activated housekeeping  and non-hox transcription factor genes. the second wave  transiently activated genes specific to actin cytoskeleton, nervous system development , and pdgf pathway. the third wave, visible at  <dig> h time point, activated genes involved in cell-cell signalling, cation transport, sensory perception, beta <dig> adrenergic receptors pathway, slit/robo-mediated axon guidance pathway, egf pathway, integrin signalling, adrelalin biosynthesis and angiogenesis .

all the above associations between gene co-localization and the dynamics of transcription do not have a simple interpretation. therefore we further investigated the distribution of dynamic modes for each individual ga class. lncrnas significantly correlating with their associated protein coding genes were compared against the non-significantly correlating ones.

association between gas and expression dynamics
in the view of the above observations, modes of rapid  and delayed  up- and down-regulation of lncrnas were of a particular interest. among the lncrnas activated by  <dig> h, intergenic transcripts represented two thirds of negatively correlating lncrnas . for the positively correlating lncrnas this ga class, although abundant, was less frequent than intronic ga . at the same time, among the lncrnas repressed by  <dig> h the fractions of intergenic and intronic transcripts were not equal for both positively and negatively correlating lncrnas . a different picture was observed for lncrnas activated and repressed by  <dig> h. only positively correlating repressed lncrnas were characterized with intronic transcripts as the dominant ga class. it represented 68% of positively correlating repressed lncrnas versus 36% among the induced lncrnas .

remarkably, lncrnas co-localized with associated proteins in  <dig> kbp-distant bidirectional promoters, as well as in upstream and downstream intergenic regions, were significantly associated with rapid induction, but not rapid repression . most of them positively correlated with the associated protein coding genes . however, the effect of such induction was rather long term . at the same time, for lncrnas localized within  <dig> kbp from the protein coding genes in bidirectional promoters and downstream intergenic regions, rapid repression was a more common mode. although the distribution of dynamic modes in correlating protein-associated lncrnas at  <dig> kbp and  <dig> kbp distances in bidirectional promoters and upstream regions was biased towards rapid activation, the majority of rapidly activated and repressed proximal  lncrnas were equally represented in these ga classes . for intergenic downstream lncrnas a similar tendency was observed. moreover, for the  <dig> kbp-distant lncrnas of this ga class the bias was shifted towards rapid repression with ratio 9: <dig> . notably, among lncrnas encoded within  <dig> kbp distance from bidirectional promoters, the bias towards increased expression by  <dig> h and, especially,  <dig> h was evident, suggesting existence of a mechanism for the rapid and prolonged activation in the cells.

a clear difference was also observed between intronic sense and intronic antisense lncrnas. while for the former rapid activation and induction were equally represented, the latter revealed a 14: <dig> bias towards rapid repression . for intronic antisense ga the number of lncrnas activated by  <dig> h was  <dig> -times higher than this number forthe repressedgenes. among the lncrnas positively correlating with the associated protein coding genes an opposite bias for delayed regulation was observed. the number of lncrnas repressed by  <dig> h was  <dig> -times higher than that activated by  <dig> h , although the number of up- and downregulated lncrnas by this time point was comparable and predominant relatively to the rapid activation modes.

provided that the majority of intronic antisense lncrnas had decreased expression level already by  <dig> h, the results are likely to reflect a slow activation mechanism of lncrnas not correlating with their associated protein coding genes. at the same time, slowly repressed, rapidly activated and rapidly repressed intronic lncrnas were mainly positively correlating with their associated protein coding genes. see additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> for more details.

validation of microarray data using qrt-pcr
quantitative rt-pcr  was utilized to validate the correlation patterns of lncrna-protein coding gene pairs obtained with microarrays. for the validation experiments, we selected five positively and five negatively correlating gene pairs. they represented the following major ga classes: intronic sense, intronic antisense, intergenic, antisense and bidirectional. qrt-pcr data for all the gene pairs were concordant with the corresponding microarray data .

discussion
in previous studies focusing on the analysis of dynamics of lncrna expression only four or less architecture classes have been considered. the first study describing genome-wide dynamics of lncrna expression was published by ravasi and colleagues in  <dig>  <cit> . activation of mouse macrophages with lps led to upregulation of  <dig> and downregulation of  <dig> lncrnas. several of these transcripts were encoded on the opposite strand of protein-coding genes. time-course analysis of the activation response revealed no consistent pattern in the expression dynamics of these sense-antisense gene pairs  <cit> . in a later work, the idea of coordinated regulation of co-localized lncrna-protein coding gene pairs was tested in a study involving  <dig> time points of a 16-day course of differentiation of embryoid bodies  <cit> . the lncrna-protein coding gene pairs were classified into three categories by their genomic architecture: cis-antisense, bidirectional promoter-associated and intronic. using pearson's correlation analysis, the study demonstrated that bidirectional and intronic-associated, but not cis-antisense classes of transcript pairs tend to correlate positively. interestingly, their randomized controls demonstrated a strong bias towards positive correlation coefficients in cis-antisense pairs and negative correlation for intronic and bidirectional architectures. at the same time, existence of both positively and negatively correlating examples of lncrna-protein coding gene pairs was noted.

our study confirms the previous observations in that intronic and bidirectional gene pairs tend to correlate positively. a detailed analysis of genomic architecture allowed us for the first time to demonstrate that lncrnas in downstream-associated orientations towards protein coding genes tend to correlate negatively with the protein coding genes, while intronic antisense transcripts were equally represented as positively and negatively correlating . a detailed analysis of expression dynamics revealed that intronic transcripts more often postitively correlate with their paired protein coding transcripts when repression of the former is observed . at the same time, positive correlation is predominantly observed for intronic lncrnas with rapid , but not slow  activation.

the microarray array results gene pairs representative of all major gas have been successfully validated by qrt-pcr. our data indicate that intergenic lncrna bc <dig>  encoded in the hoxd gene cluster between hoxd <dig> and hoxd <dig>  was highly induced and positively correlated with hoxd <dig> expression. hoxd is one of the four hox clusters of genes that are essential for embryonic development. these clusters are characterized by extensive network of lncrna expression  <cit>  with a concordant expression of lncrnasand hoxgenes. interestingly, individual induction of several hoxd genes was sufficient to induce both growth arrest and neuronal differentiation, which is associated with downregulation of cell cycle-promoting genes and upregulation of neuronal differentiation genes  <cit> . the concordant expression of lncrnas and hox genes was also reported for the hoxa cluster during ra-induced differentiation of teratocarcinoma cell line  <cit>  and for hoxb cluster during mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation  <cit> . such co-regulated expressions may reflect shared regulatory elements of transcription or could be due to regulatory activity of lncrna controlling the neighbouring genes. the transcriptional activity of hox genes is highly dependent on chromatin modifications, such as active chromatin associated histone h3k <dig> trimethylation  or repressing h3k <dig> trimethylation   <cit> . indeed, the common regulatory theme of lncrna-mediated control of hox genes is recruitment of chromatin modifying complexes catalyzing these modifications, such as cis-activation of hoxa cluster by hottip lncrna-mediated recruitment of wdr5/mll complex causing h3k4me <dig> modification  <cit> , or trans-repression of hoxd genes by hotair lncrna recruiting prc <dig> complex that imposes h3k27me <dig> mark  <cit> .

regarding the antisense ga, a comparable number of cases of positively and negatively correlating gene pairs were observed . therefore, it is possible that both positive  <cit>  and negative  <cit>  regulatory mechanisms may act in such cases. currently, the postive regulatory role of antisense transcripts is more favored in the scientific community. however, here we report a validated case of negative correlation of fw <dig> lncrna with the transcript of its tail-to-tail antisense protein-coding neighbor paics . paics catalyzes steps  <dig> and  <dig> of purine biosynthesis required for proliferation of cancer cells. paics is activated in many cancer types  <cit> . arrest of neuroblastoma cells proliferation is preceded their differentiation.

in our study we noticed an unusual case of lncrna ak <dig> sharing a bidirectional promoter with fkbp <dig> protein-coding gene and negatively correlating with its transcription . the ligand of fkbp <dig>  fk <dig> was shown to stimulate neuronal differentiation and induce the rapid regeneration of hippocampal neurons  <cit> . it is usually assumed that transcription of genes from bidirectional promoters correlates positively. indeed, such antiregulated expression of genes, as negatively correlating ak <dig> -fkbp <dig> gene pair is relatively rare in the human genome accounting for only 11% of cases  <cit> . this negative correlation may reflect the cis-regulatory effect of ak <dig> on fkbp <dig> transcription, as has been reported for promoter associated lncrnas targeting prc <dig> complex that causes repressive histone trimethylation   <cit>  for targeting inhibitors of activating histone deacetylases on the promoter of cyclin d <dig> gene  <cit> . an alternative model of inhibition of coding gene by non-coding transcription from bidirectional promoter is via the competition for the same pool of general transcription factors as was described for cryptic unstable transcripts  regulating tpi <dig> gene expression in the yeast  <cit> . in this case the act of transcription is important per se rather than the functional activity of the transcription product.

detailed go analysis revealed that lncrna genes have a tendency to co-localize with protein-coding genes having specific biological functions, such as embryonic development and cytoskeleton reorganization . moreover, these functional associations were specific for certain ga classes. by analyzing the dynamics of differentially expressed lncrnas and their associated genes we found that these functions are realized by the cells via at least three gene expression waves. the first wave activated genes with housekeeping functions. the second wave was characterized by activation of homeotic transcription factors, pdgf pathway and actin cytoskeleton-related genes. genes activated during the third wave encoded receptors, metabolism and signalling pathways specific to neural cells. the coordinated waves of gene expression have been reported for protein coding genes during neuronal differentiation of embryonic stem cells  <cit> . our study is the first demonstration of such waves for lncrna genes.

in sum, in the present paper we dissected a global picture of correlating expression between lncrnas and their neighboring protein-coding genes. we provided a detailed analysis of genome architecture, which we regard as an active player in regulation of transcription. working hypotheses regarding particular systemic mechanisms bridging together coding and noncoding parts of the genome to regulate cellular differentiation have been formulated. future studies will be dedicated to their exprerimental testing.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report detailing dynamical changes of multiple lncrnas during ra-induced neuroblastoma differentiation. integration of genomic and transcriptomic levels of information allowed us to demonstrate specific behavior of lncrnas organized in different gas. this study also provides a list of lncrnas with possible roles in neuroblastoma.
