BACKGROUND
in the short period that the zebrafish  has been utilised for biomedical studies it has emerged as a powerful genetic tool and an ideal model system for both organogenesis and as a vertebrate model for human disease  <cit> . the embryonic zebrafish heart is the first organ to develop, and shows similarity to the embryonic human heart, specific comparison has been drawn to show developmental parity between the  <dig> hours post fertilisation  zebrafish heart and the human heart at three weeks  <cit> . one clear advantage of utilising the zebrafish, as a model organism, is that normal cardiac function in embryonic zebrafish is not required for several days, sufficient oxygen is obtained by diffusion  <cit> . fish, unlike rodent models, are not dependent on a cardiovascular system for survival during embryogenesis. cardiac activity is not coupled with metabolic demand  <cit>  and hence defects in cardiac development or function are less likely to result in early mortality. furthermore, the zebrafish embryo is virtually transparent which permits imaging of internal organs, especially the heart, using standard light microscopy. for these reasons, the zebrafish is an ideal model system in which to examine developmental biology and organogenesis.

the zebrafish heart is essentially two chambered with valves dividing the atrium and ventricle and a second valve separating the ventricle from the outflow tract or bulbous arteriosum  <cit> . prior to  <dig> hpf the lateral cardiac primordia join to form a definitive heart tube which begins to contract in a coordinated, rhythmic fashion and by  <dig> hpf contributes to circulation by peristaltic waves. at  <dig> hpf morphological differentiation from the heart tube to chambers is observed and by  <dig> hpf the circulatory system is more mature with the heart having looped to form a dorsally positioned atrium  <cit> . all major organs are present by this stage. by 5-days post fertilisation  the embryonic heart is essentially that of an adult teleost configuration  <cit>  with a functional cardiovascular system conforming to a vertebrate developmental plan  <cit> .

the zebrafish embryo measures approximately  <dig>  mm in length at  <dig> dpf. this small size presents a technical challenge to assessment of the functional characteristics of the heart. unsurprisingly therefore, many previous studies have focused predominantly on counts of heart rate observed directly by microscopy or combined with video image capture  <cit> . these studies have limitations in that simple measures of heart rate do not provide information on cardiac contractility. other studies have reported estimates of cardiac output and ejection fraction using single systolic and diastolic video frames from light microscopy to derive cardiac output and ejection fraction  <cit> . such estimates are limited in that they are derived from 2-dimensional images using geometric assumptions of ventricular shape and they reflect systolic function only; there are no reports of measures of diastolic function in the zebrafish. more recently reported techniques using rotational imaging  <cit>  and confocal microscopy  <cit>  provide detailed three dimensional imaging of the zebrafish embryonic heart but this is not widely available and is relatively expensive and time consuming to perform. furthermore, other than counts of heart rate, the effects of pharmacological interventions on cardiac systolic and diastolic function have not been widely studied.

the aim of this study was to assess and implement a technique which would allow the continuous assessment of heart rate, ventricular wall motion amplitude and wall motion velocity in systole and diastole. this technique potentially allows the accurate assessment of both the extent of response and the time course of responses to various physiological and pharmacological interventions and could be adapted to high throughput screening.

RESULTS
cardiac wall motion changes during development 
effects of norepenephrine
norepenephrine significantly increased heart rate, myocardial wall velocity in systole, myocardial wall velocity in diastole and wall motion amplitude in  <dig> and  <dig> day embryos . the observed changes in these parameters were less marked in  <dig> day compared with  <dig> day embryos . in  <dig> dpf embryos, ne produced a mean 20% increase in mwvs and a mean 15% increase in mwvd. however, at  <dig> dpf ne produced a mean 75% increase in mwvs and a mean 90% increase in mwvd.

*comparison between  <dig> and  <dig> day embryos

effects of ms <dig> 
administration of increasing concentrations of ms <dig> to the bathing water resulted in progressive reduction in heart rate, wall motion amplitude and myocardial wall velocities in systole and diastole in both  <dig> day and  <dig> day embryos . in  <dig> day embryos, wall motion amplitude, myocardial wall velocities in systole and diastole fell by approximately 30% before any significant reduction in heart rate was observed. this occurred over a concentration range of ms <dig> normally used in our laboratory for anaesthesia . in  <dig> day embryos, there was a slight rise in the mean myocardial wall velocity in diastole at low doses of ms- <dig> accompanied by a small rise in heart rate . at higher doses the heart rate fell in conjunction with other wall motion parameters.

effects of temperature on zebrafish cardiac function
heart rate was significantly higher at 28°c compared with 22°c . wall motion amplitude did not change significantly at higher temperature but there was a significant increase in myocardial wall velocity in systole and a borderline significant increase in myocardial wall velocity in diastole.

effects of zebrafish strain 
comparing ab and golden strains at  <dig> days and  <dig> days, there were no significant differences observed in the any of the wall motion characteristics at these developmental time points .

discussion
this study has applied a video-edge detection technique previously validated in assessing motion in mammalian single cardiac myocytes  <cit> . the technique provides continuous measurement of a number of cardiac parameters which reflect different aspects of cardiac function: heart rate, amplitude of myocardial wall movement, myocardial wall velocity during systole and myocardial wall velocity during diastole. assessing these parameters during the first  <dig> days of development has revealed a progressive increase in heart rate and progressive improvement of wall motion characteristics at  <dig> hour intervals. furthermore, we have demonstrated clear changes in myocardial wall velocities in systole and diastole in response to drugs administered into the bathing water and changes resulting from alteration in bathing water temperature. the findings therefore not only suggest that this technique is feasible but that it has the capacity and sensitivity to detect both large and small differences in cardiac function which could result from genetic or environmental manipulation.

the technique is also useful in determining responses to drugs that are known to influence cardiac function in fish. drugs such as norepenephrine appear to be readily absorbed through the gills even with the embryo embedded in a weak agar solution. other workers have reported similar responses to cardio-active drugs when introduced into the bathing water  <cit> . this pharmacological approach provides the potential for experiments examining the responsiveness of zebrafish myocardium to cardio-active drugs following genetic manipulations which potentially induce phenotypes analogous to human cardiomyopathy or heart failure  <cit> . in this way, altered responsiveness to such drugs could be useful in detecting and further defining similarities in phenotype to human disease.

the findings of this study also provide insights into developmental time points of the adrenergic system in the zebrafish heart. while norepenephrine had a significant effect on 4-day zebrafish embryo hearts this was much less obvious in 2-day embryos. the difference in response to norepenephrine was most marked for relaxation velocity which is known to be strongly influenced by adrenoreceptor mechanisms in mammalian tissue. this is consistent with previously published work in zebrafish showing response of heart rate to isoproterenol  <cit>  at various developmental time points and work showing an increase in cardiac out put in  <dig> and 4-day zebrafish embryos injected with norepenephrine  <cit> . the ability to assess cardiac chamber wall motion directly provides more specific information on the response of the heart to drugs compared with techniques focusing on heart rate alone. such studies have reported bradycardia in response to drugs known to prolong repolarisation  <cit>  but there are also reports of bradycardia in response to drugs not known to act directly on cardiac conducting mechanisms, such as warfarin and atorvastatin  <cit> . this highlights the need for characterisation of drug responses in the zebrafish heart using techniques that assess not only heart rate but also chamber specific wall motion.

in contrast to norepenephrine, the anaesthetic agent ms <dig> was found to depress cardiac function in a dose dependent fashion in  <dig> and 4-day embryos. this suggests that the mechanism of action of this drug on the heart is established as early as  <dig> hours after fertilisation. previous studies have described a decrease in heart rate at higher concentrations of ms <dig> and a slight increase at lower concentrations  <cit> . one previous study suggested a reduction in stroke volume and cardiac output measured indirectly using aortic blood flow  <cit> . previous studies have described greater sensitivity to ms <dig>  in terms of lethality and deep anaesthesia, at younger gestation  <cit> . our study goes further and suggests that significant reductions in cardiac wall motion indices occur in 2-day embryos even before any change in heart rate is observed. this important finding raises the possibility that there is significant depression of cardiac contractility at concentrations of ms <dig> widely used for fish anaesthesia in younger embryos. in the study reported here, all assessment of cardiac wall motion comparing  <dig> –  <dig> day embryos was conducted without anaesthesia with the fish immobilised in agar.

the effect of temperature on zebrafish heart rate has been examined previously in normal zebrafish  <cit>  and in the zebrafish breakdance mutant  <cit> . heart rate appears to show a steep positive association with temperature with rates of up to  <dig> beats per minute reported at 31°c. in this study we have shown a similar steep relationship between temperature and heart rate and we have also demonstrated, for the first time, significant increases in the velocity of the myocardial wall during contraction and a trend for enhanced velocity during relaxation at higher temperatures. this confirms a close coupling between myocardial metabolism and temperature and supports the need for careful temperature control during experiments assessing cardiac function in poikilothermic fish.

there were no differences observed between ab and golden strains of zebrafish comparing  <dig> day and 5-day embryos. ab strain heart rates found in this study are similar to those found by other workers, however, a wide range for heart rates has been reported ranging from 140– <dig> beats per minute at 3-days to 135– <dig> beats per minute at 5-days  <cit> . different heart rates have been reported in albino and ab strains  <cit>  but this is the first report comparing different strains using qualitative assessment of heart rate and cardiac wall motion.

screening large numbers of zebrafish embryos is a strategy widely used to identify phenotypic features suggestive of an underlying genetic defect  <cit> . this video edge detection technique could be applied to examine more sensitively for cardiac wall motion abnormalities in such screens. however, the technique does require a degree of operator skill and it is likely that the number of fish that could be assessed per day would be approximately 30– <dig>  it is possible that the technique could be combined with more automated microscopic systems, using wells with individual fish to provide more rapid assessment of ventricular wall movements. while this would be valuable, the technique also lends itself to the evaluation of qualitative differences in cardiac function at specified developmental time points and could be used in knock down experiments  <cit>  of genes known to affect cardiac performance.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has outlined a novel method for assessing cardiac wall motion in zebrafish embryos from 2-days to 5-days post-fertilisation. the technique extends our ability to assess cardiac function from, simple measures of heart rate and snap-shot assessments of changes in ventricular area using single frame images, to continuous assessment of wall motion. the technique appears sensitive to pharmacological and physiological interventions and provides a relatively inexpensive method of characterising subtle and cycle-specific changes in cardiac function resulting from genetic and pharmacological manipulation.
