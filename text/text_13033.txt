BACKGROUND
annual soybean yield losses caused by soybean cyst nematode  in the united states alone were estimated at  <dig>  billion dollars  <cit> . one of the effective ways to control this disease is through deployment of genetic resistance in soybean cultivars. two of the major sources of resistance employed in breeding programs are derived from soybean lines pi  <dig> and peking , especially the former  <cit> . recently, the genes underlying two major qtl , rhg <dig> and rhg <dig>  responsible for resistance to scn in the soybean lines, have been cloned  <cit> . however, due to the overuse of the resistance from these sources, scn populations showing increasing reproduction on resistant soybean cultivars have emerged  <cit> . thus, new sources of resistance are needed for sustainable soybean production. for this purpose, a number of studies have screened plant introductions  in the usda soybean germplasm collection for new sources of resistance to scn. as a result, new resistant lines were identified . among these identified resistant lines, pi  <dig> and pi 567516c were highly resistant to multiple scn races   <cit> . different from pi  <dig>  pi 567516c is also highly resistant to the synthetic nematode population ly <dig>  which was derived from a mass mating of scn races  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . this uniqueness is in agreement with the findings that pi 567516c is genetically different from most other scn resistant lines   <cit>  and contains two novel qtl, which were genetically mapped on chromosomes   <dig> and  <dig> for resistance to multiple scn races  <cit> . although pi  <dig> was shown to contain two known qtl , a new qtl for resistance to scn hg types  <dig>   <dig> . <dig>  and  <dig> . <dig> . <dig> , was mapped to chr.  <dig>  <cit> . therefore, pi  <dig> and pi 567516c are two important sources with resistance to multiple scn hg types, different from most other scn resistant lines, including pi  <dig> and peking.

microarrays are an important tool to study global gene expression in organisms, including soybean, in their growth/development processes and their responses to internal and external stimuli  <cit> . the first-generation affymetrix soybean genome array covering approximately  <dig>  soybean transcripts  has been extensively used to probe the soybean-nematode interactions, and tremendous information has thus been generated . with the completion of the soybean genome sequencing project  <cit> , the second-generation affymetrix soybean genome array, called the affymetrix soybean whole-genome transcript array , covering approximately  <dig>  predicted soybean transcripts, was designed  <cit> . this array has been used to study how soybean responded to fungal infection and abiotic drought stress  <cit> . however, so far no study has been reported using this new soybean wt genome array to investigate the interactions of soybean with scn or other nematode species. expectedly, the application of this new array should provide a better and broader picture of soybean gene expression profiles in response to scn due to its broader coverage of the soybean genome.

in the present work, the soybean wt array was used to probe the gene expression profiles in the two important soybean pis , which are resistant to multiple scn hg types, and a susceptible soybean cultivar, magellan, in response to the scn inoculation at two time points . these two time points roughly correspond with the initiation and establishment of syncytia, respectively  <cit> . our current work revealed significant gene expression differences between these two pis and the susceptible cultivar in response to the scn inoculation, although some overlap was observed. additionally,  <dig> genes were found constitutively expressed or suppressed in the two resistant pis compared with the susceptible cultivar, suggesting that both constitutive and inducible gene expression may contribute to resistance to multiple scn hg types in the two resistant lines. our present study revealed not only data similar to those in the published microarray work, but also some new information, such as the potential role of ethylene, protein degradation, and phenylpropanoid pathways in mediating the soybean-scn interactions. the findings from the current study will benefit our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to scn in soybean and may provide information for manipulating soybean resistance to scn through genetic engineering.

RESULTS
gene expression profiling of the three soybean genotypes
to compare the gene expression profiles among the three soybean genotypes  in response to scn infection, 3-day-old seedlings  were inoculated with  <dig>  j <dig>  scn of hg type  <dig>   <cit>  for  <dig> and 8 days, respectively. seedlings treated with water  were also collected at days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  to serve as the controls for the scn-inoculated samples, and meanwhile to monitor constitutive gene expression in the resistant genotypes, pi  <dig> and pi 567516c, in the absence of scn by comparing with the susceptible genotype, cv. magellan. in the present study, the scn-regulated genes in a particular soybean line were obtained by comparing the scn-inoculated sample with the corresponding water-treated sample at the same time point, and the constitutively-regulated genes in a particular resistant soybean line were obtained by comparing the water-treated resistant soybean line with the water-treated susceptible line  at day  <dig> 

analysis of the present microarray data using dchip   <cit>  revealed that  <dig>  genes  were differentially regulated either constitutively or due to the scn inoculation . out of these genes,  <dig>  were constitutively regulated in the two resistant pi lines by comparing with the cv. magellan, and  <dig>  genes were responsive to the scn inoculation in the three genotypes. interestingly,  <dig> genes that were regulated constitutively in the two resistant pis were also responsive to the scn inoculation. however, by comparing with the most recent soybean genome assembly and annotations , only  <dig>  genes out of the  <dig>  remained that were regulated either constitutively or by the scn inoculation . among them,  <dig> genes were constitutively regulated in the two resistant pi lines by comparing with cv. magellan ,  <dig>  genes were responsive to the scn inoculation in the three genotypes , and  <dig> that were constitutively regulated in the two resistant pis were also responsive to the scn inoculation . these data suggest that both constitutive and inducible gene expression may contribute to the observed resistance in the two resistant soybean pis.

to validate the quality of the microarray data,  <dig> genes were randomly selected and examined for their expression using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction . in most cases, the qpcr results were similar to those of the microarray experiment , indicating the high quality of our microarray data.

to identify groups of co-expressed genes to reveal biological pathways and postulate transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, the constitutively regulated  <dig> genes were clustered using dchip  <cit> . these genes were roughly clustered into two major clades . clade 1: genes constitutively up-regulated in both pi lines, and clade 2: genes constitutively down-regulated in both pi lines. there are also minor clades showing unique regulations of genes in these two pi lines, e.g., clade 2a , and clade 2b . the hierarchical clustering of the scn-regulated  <dig>  genes using dchip  <cit>  roughly separated them into five major clades . clade 1: genes mainly down-regulated by scn in different lines at  <dig> or  <dig> dpi; clade 2: genes mainly up-regulated in one line  at  <dig> dpi; clade 3: genes up-regulated in multiple lines at  <dig> and/or  <dig> dpi; clade 4: genes with opposite expression in different lines at  <dig> and/or  <dig> dpi, and clade 5: genes up-regulated in all lines at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi.figure  <dig>

in the following sections, we will further analyze both constitutively- and scn-regulated genes to reveal commonality and uniqueness of gene expression between different soybean lines and pathways potentially important in regulating soybean resistance to scn.

genes constitutively regulated in the two resistant pi lines
to reveal potentially important pathways or groups of genes involved in resistance to scn, the constitutively-regulated  <dig> genes were grouped into the following functional categories using mapman  <cit> : cell wall metabolism , lipid metabolism , secondary metabolism , abiotic stress , biotic stress , transcription regulation , signaling , hormonal pathways , protein modification and degradation , transport , development , enzyme families , other groups of genes , and unclassified genes  . it is worth noting that  <dig> nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat  resistance genes and one leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase , seven protease and ubiquitin ligase genes ,  <dig> tf genes , and four jasmonate pathway genes  were constitutively regulated in the resistant pi lines, suggesting a possible role in regulating resistance to multiple scn races in these soybean lines.figure  <dig> 
functional categories of the constitutively-regulated genes. the  <dig> genes constitutively regulated  in the two resistant lines were categorized using mapman.



genes constitutively regulated  in both resistant pi lines: among the  <dig> genes constitutively regulated in the two resistant pi lines,  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes down-regulated commonly in both resistant pi lines . for example, glyma.01g <dig>  and glyma.03g <dig> , both encoding an nbs-lrr type resistance protein, were highly up-regulated in both resistant lines, and genes glyma.08g <dig>  and glyma.08g <dig> , both also encoding an nbs-lrr type resistance protein, were significantly down-regulated in both resistant lines . these commonly regulated defense genes may play a common role, possibly in defense against scn, in both resistant pi lines.figure  <dig> 
venn diagrams to show commonality and uniqueness of the constitutively-regulated genes between the two resistant lines. in total,  <dig> genes were constitutively regulated in the two resistant soybean lines .



genes constitutively regulated  in pi  <dig> or pi 567516c: in addition to those genes commonly regulated in both resistant pis, there were also genes regulated differently in the two resistant pi lines:  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes down-regulated only in pi  <dig> ; meanwhile,  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes down-regulated only in pi 567516c . for example, glyma.12g <dig> , encoding a protein tyrosine kinase, was significantly up-regulated in pi  <dig>  but not in pi 567516c; glyma.01g <dig> , encoding a clathrin light chain, was significantly down-regulated in pi  <dig>  but not in pi 567516c; glyma.13g <dig> , encoding a pathogenesis-related  family protein, was significantly up-regulated in pi 567516c, but not in pi 437654; and glyma.11g <dig> , encoding a gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, was significantly down-regulated in pi 567516c, but not in pi  <dig>  these uniquely regulated genes possibly contribute to the unique traits in these pi lines, and therefore deserve to be further studied.

genes regulated by the scn inoculation in the three soybean genotypes
in addition to the constitutively-regulated genes,  <dig>  genes were also regulated by the scn inoculation in the three soybean genotypes . once again, to get a better picture of what major gene categories and pathways were differentially regulated in the three soybean genotypes by scn, the  <dig>  genes were grouped into the following functional categories using mapman  <cit> : cell wall metabolism , secondary metabolism , abiotic stress , biotic stress , transcription , signaling , hormone metabolism , protein modification and degradation , and transport , development , enzyme families , other groups of genes , and unclassified genes  . overall, the data suggest that many genes and pathways were affected in soybeans upon the infection by scn. noteworthily, genes involved in the following pathways or processes were over-represented: secondary metabolism, transcription, hormone metabolism, and protein modification and degradation. these genes and the pathways mediated by them possibly play an important role in regulating the interactions of soybean with scn. we will discuss more about these genes and pathways later in this paper.figure  <dig> 
functional categories of the scn-regulated genes. the  <dig>  genes regulated by scn  in different soybean lines were categorized using mapman.



genes commonly regulated by the scn inoculation in two or three genotypes : among the  <dig>  scn-regulated genes,  <dig> genes were regulated by scn at  <dig> dpi . among them,  <dig> genes were commonly up-regulated and only one gene commonly down-regulated in all three lines by the scn inoculation at  <dig> dpi, e.g., glyma.02g <dig>  and glyma.05g <dig>  ;  <dig> genes were commonly up-regulated and four genes commonly down-regulated only in cv. magellan and pi  <dig>  e.g., glyma.14g <dig>  and glyma.09g <dig>  ;  <dig> genes were commonly up-regulated and six commonly down-regulated only in pi  <dig> and pi 567516c, e.g., glyma.13g <dig>  and glyma.20g <dig>  ; and  <dig> genes were commonly up-regulated and  <dig> genes commonly down-regulated only in magellan and pi 567516c, e.g., glyma.18g <dig>  and glyma.03g <dig>  . these commonly regulated genes may be involved in regulating general defense against scn infection in multiple soybean lines.figure  <dig> 
venn diagrams to show commonality and uniqueness of the scn-regulated genes between different lines. in total,  <dig>  genes were regulated by scn in different soybean lines . a at  <dig> dpi; b at  <dig> dpi. dpi: days post-inoculation.



genes uniquely regulated by the scn inoculation in individual genotypes : in addition to the commonly regulated genes by scn in multiple soybean lines,  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes down-regulated only in cv. magellan ;  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes down-regulated only in pi  <dig> ; and  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes down-regulated only in pi 567516c . for example, glyma.06g <dig>  was up-regulated only in cv. magellan, and glyma.04g <dig>  was down-regulated only in magellan; glyma.05g <dig>  was up-regulated only in pi 437654), and glyma.08g <dig> , was down-regulated only in pi 437654; glyma.20g <dig>  was up-regulated, and glyma.07g <dig>  was down-regulated only in pi 567516c. these uniquely regulated genes possibly contribute to the observed difference in resistance to scn in these soybean lines.

genes regulated by the scn inoculation at  <dig> dpi: surprisingly, only  <dig> genes were significantly regulated by scn at  <dig> dpi, with only  <dig> of them also regulated by scn at  <dig> dpi . the data suggest that different gene regulation may have occurred at the late stages of infection/defense, and scn may also have suppressed expression of many genes to benefit infection at  <dig> dpi.

genes both constitutively- and scn-regulated in soybean
thirty genes that were regulated constitutively in the two resistant pis were also responsive to the scn inoculation , e.g., glyma.08g <dig>  and glyma.09g <dig> . these genes possibly play an important role in mediating the soybean-scn interactions, and therefore may be good targets to manipulate for enhancing soybean resistance to scn.

examples of gene families and pathways potentially important in regulating soybean resistance to scn
defense genes: similar to published microarray studies  <cit> , our present work revealed that  <dig> defense genes were regulated either constitutively or by scn . among them are five genes  encoding proteins similar to arabidopsis pathogenesis-related  proteins, one gene  encoding an protein similar to arabidopsis eds <dig> , one gene  encoding a protein similar to arabidopsis rbohd , one gene  encoding a protein similar to arabidopsis pgip <dig>  and glyma.08g <dig> ] encoding trypsin and protease inhibitor family proteins. most importantly,  <dig> genes  encode nbs-lrr type disease resistance proteins, accounting for a significant number of the total  <dig> nbs-lrr resistance proteins encoded by the soybean genome  <cit> . all this information together supports that defense genes, especially nbs-lrr resistance genes, are important in mediating soybean resistance to scn. the defense genes revealed in the present study are possibly good targets to regulate for soybean defense against scn. indeed, matthews and colleagues recently showed that the over-expression of glyma.05g <dig>  significantly enhanced soybean resistance to scn  <cit> .

transcription factors : tfs are important regulators of gene expression and are involved in plant defense against pathogens  <cit>  as well as in many other events. overall,  <dig> tf genes were found regulated by the scn inoculation in the current work . additionally,  <dig> tf genes were regulated constitutively in the resistant lines  . these tf genes were primarily from the following tf families: myb  domain-containing proteins , basic helix-loop-helix , apetala2-ethylene-responsive element binding proteins , wrky domain transcription factors , c2c <dig> zinc finger proteins , and c2h <dig> zinc finger proteins . for example, glyma.03g <dig> , glyma.14g <dig> , and glyma.16g <dig>   were significantly induced by scn in all three genotypes; glyma.19g <dig>  was constitutively up-regulated, and glyma.13g <dig>  was constitutively down-regulated in both resistant lines. considering that many similar tfs have been shown to be involved in plant defense against different pathogens in various plants  <cit> , these soybean tf genes deserve further investigation to explore their possible role in mediating soybean resistance to scn.

protein degradation: although many microarray studies have been done on soybean-scn interactions, only limited information was revealed in these studies about protein ubiquitination and degradation during such interactions , likely due to the limited coverage of the soybean genome by the arrays used in those studies. surprisingly, in the present study, we found that  <dig> genes potentially involved in protein degradation were regulated by scn and another seven genes were constitutively regulated in two resistant lines . for example, glyma.07g <dig>  was constitutively up-regulated in both resistant pi lines, and glyma.09g <dig>  was constitutively down-regulated in both resistant pi lines; glyma.18g <dig>  and glyma.09g <dig>  were induced in all three soybean genotypes; and glyma.02g <dig>  and glyma.06g <dig>  were down-regulated, especially at  <dig> dpi, in all three genotypes. protein degradation is implicated in mediating plant-pathogen interactions as well as in many other processes  <cit> . however, very little is known about their involvement in mediating plant-nematode interactions. further investigation of the genes revealed in the present work is needed to confirm their potential roles in mediating soybean-scn interactions, and such studies could lead to effective ways to enhance soybean resistance to scn through modulating protein degradation during soybean-scn interactions.

hormones: hormones play an important role in plant-nematode interactions, as well as in plant interactions with other pathogens  <cit> . in our present study,  <dig> genes potentially involved in hormonal metabolism were found to be regulated constitutively and/or by scn . among them,  <dig> genes were regulated by scn and  <dig> genes were constitutively regulated in two resistant lines . surprisingly, among them were  <dig> genes potentially involved in ethylene metabolism. the data suggest that ethylene and its mediated pathway may play a more important role in regulating soybean-scn interactions than we thought, in addition to its role in regulating plant interactions with other pathogens  <cit> . consistent with this, tucker et al.  <cit>  showed that the level of the ethylene precursor, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid , was higher in scn-colonized root parts than in other parts of the root, and a set of acc synthase genes were clearly differentially expressed in scn-colonized root parts and non-colonized roots or root tips. recently, fudali et al.  <cit>  also showed that ethylene signaling modulated attraction of root-knot nematodes to arabidopsis roots. therefore, ethylene may be another plant hormone important in regulating soybean-scn interactions, in addition to jasmonic acid , which was well documented in the previous work  <cit> . in the present study, we also revealed genes potentially involved in other hormonal pathways: jasmonic acid , auxin , salicylic acid , gibberellin , abscisic acid , cytokinin , and brassinosteroids  , similar to the findings by other researchers  <cit> . overall, plant hormones, especially ethylene and ja, are possibly critical in mediating soybean-scn interactions, and further investigation is needed to understand their exact mechanisms in this process.

the phenylpropanoid pathway: the phenylpropanoid pathway plays an important role in plant growth and development as well as in biotic and abiotic stress responses, likely through regulating the formation of lignin, flavonoids, phytoalexins, etc.  <cit> . our current microarray data showed that  <dig> genes potentially involved in this pathway were regulated by the scn inoculation . for example, glyma.01g <dig>  and glyma.06g <dig>   were significantly induced in all three lines by scn. consistent with our findings, previous microarray work also revealed multiple genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway regulated by the scn inoculation  <cit> ; however, our present work revealed more genes, once again, likely due to the broader coverage of the soybean genome by the array used in our study. additionally, an early report by edens et al.  <cit>  showed that transcription of the genes encoding phenylalanine ammonia lyase and 4-coumaryl coa ligase and the activities of these enzymes increased in resistant, but not in susceptible, soybean cultivars after nematode infection. and such increase in transcription and enzymatic activities led to increased synthesis of glyceollin, a phytoallaxin that inhibits multiple soybean pathogens  <cit> . therefore, the phenylpropanoid pathway possibly plays a critical role in mediating soybean resistance to scn, and further investigation is needed to understand how this pathway is involved in the process.

other noticeable pathways or gene families
in addition, many genes in the following important gene families or processes were also found regulated constitutively and/or by the scn inoculation in the current study: cell wall modification , transporters , development , receptor-like kinases , cytochrome p <dig> , peroxidases , and calcium signaling  . these groups of genes were also revealed in many previous microarray studies , although generally with a smaller number, likely due to the limited coverage of the genome by the microarrays used in those studies. further investigation of these genes will benefit our understanding of soybean-scn interactions and may lead to effective ways to control scn diseases in soybean.

promoter element analysis
to understand possible transcriptional regulation of genes revealed in the present study, promoter element analyses were conducted on the promoter regions  of different groups of genes using the motifsampler tool  <cit>  incorporated into soykb  <cit> . all hexamer sequences in their promoter regions were examined. the most frequently occurring hexamers in most groups of genes were ntatan and aaaaaa . these elements likely play a general role in regulating gene expression, such as the tata box motif with the core sequence tata, and therefore were not of interest to us. however, a number of hexamers were significantly enriched in the promoter regions of certain groups of genes . for example, the gcatgc motif was significantly enriched in the promoters of the  <dig> genes similarly up- or down-regulated by scn only in pi  <dig> and pi 567516c at  <dig> dpi; the gyggyg motif was significantly enriched in the promoters of the  <dig> genes up- or down-regulated by scn only in pi  <dig> at  <dig> dpi; and the ragaga motif was significantly enriched in the promoters of the <dig> genes up- or down-regulated by scn only in pi 567516c at  <dig> dpi, etc. . interestingly, these motifs all contain multiple gs and/or cs and appear to be novel. they are possibly involved in specific regulation of the genes revealed in the present study.

expression pattern of rhg <dig> and rhg <dig> in the three soybean genotypes
rhg <dig> and rgh <dig> are the two major qtl involved in soybean resistance to scn  <cit> . our current data showed that two out of three genes at the rhg <dig> locus  <cit> , glyma.18g <dig>  and glyma18g <dig> , had a higher expression level in both resistant pi lines than in the susceptible cv. magellan  . however, the third gene, glyma.18g <dig>  vesicle-trafficking protein), was not significantly more expressed in the resistant lines, suggesting that the rhg <dig> loci in these two resistant pis may be different from the rhg <dig> locus present in pi  <dig>  which shows significantly elevated expression of all three genes due to  <dig> copies of the 31-kb rhg <dig> repeat  <cit> . consistent with this, the recent study by cook et al.  <cit>  showed that there were only  <dig> copies of the rhg <dig> repeat at the rhg <dig> locus in pi  <dig> and the genes encoded by the rhg <dig> locus were moderately expressed relative to pi  <dig>  therefore, our current data, together with findings by other researchers may help explain why rhg <dig> loci from soybean pi  <dig> and pi  <dig> respond differentially to scn isolates  <cit> . rhg <dig> gene, glyma.08g <dig> , encodes a serine hydroxymethyltransferase  <cit> . we found that this gene was constitutively expressed in the resistant line pi  <dig> relative to the susceptible cv. magellan , but not in the resistant line pi 567516c. this result is in agreement with the mapping data that showed the presence of the rhg <dig> qtl in pi  <dig>  <cit>  and the absence of the typical rhg <dig> qtl in pi 567516c  <cit> . further studies, such as re-sequencing the corresponding rhg <dig> and rhg <dig> regions in these pi lines, are needed to elucidate the observed differences. some efforts are already under way in our laboratory and other laboratories .

the present microarray work vs. reported microarray studies
although so far many microarray studies have been done by different groups on the interactions of scn with different soybean genotypes  <cit> , it is not easy to compare our data directly with these previous results, due to the following reasons: different experimental conditions , different soybean genotypes and scn races, incompatible or compatible interactions, and different microarray platforms. however, there were a lot of similarities between our data and the published work  <cit> , for example, regulation of many defense-related genes, many hormonal pathway genes, and cell wall modification genes. but results from our study appear to provide a broader picture of the gene expression profiles, either constitutively or in response to the scn inoculation, in both resistant and susceptible soybean genotypes, due to the fact that the microarray used in our work covered many more soybean genes than those used in the previous reports. for example, we revealed more genes in ethylene pathway, protein degradation and transport processes, which could be potentially involved in mediating soybean-scn interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present work, we compared gene expression profiles in two soybean plant introductions, pi  <dig> and pi 567516c, which are resistant to multiple scn hg types, and one susceptible soybean cultivar, magellan, in the presence or absence of the scn infection. the soybean whole-genome array, which covered ~ <dig>  predicted soybean transcripts, was utilized for this purpose. to our knowledge, there has been no reported study on the soybean-scn interactions using this whole genome array yet. therefore, our current work provides a broader view of gene expression profiles in different soybean lines in the presence or absence of scn. overall,  <dig> genes were found constitutively regulated in the two resistant pi lines and  <dig>  genes were found responsive to the scn inoculation in the three soybean genotypes, with  <dig> genes regulated both constitutively and by scn. these data suggest that both constitutive and inducible gene expression may contribute to the observed resistance in the two resistant soybean pi lines. different soybean lines also showed significantly different gene expression profiles with or without the scn inoculation. in addition to the findings similar to those reported in the published work, e.g., the regulation of many defense-related and hormonal pathway genes, we found that ethylene, protein degradation, and phenylpropanoid pathways may play an important role in mediating the soybean-scn interactions. additionally, we revealed multiple gc-rich motifs that may be involved in regulating gene expression in response to the scn inoculation. further detailed studies on selected genes and pathways may help us understand the molecular mechanisms underlying soybean resistance to scn and may lead to effective ways to control the scn disease in soybean.
