BACKGROUND
the daily and seasonal geophysical variations have driven the evolution of a circadian clock system in most organisms. these biological timekeepers permit organisms to maintain near  <dig> h rhythms in most physiological processes and anticipate periodic changes in their environments. in mammals, the circadian system consists of a master circadian timekeeper in the suprachiasmatic nucleus  in the hypothalamus  <cit>  and several slave timekeepers distributed in multiple tissues throughout the body, such as the liver, lungs and kidney  <cit> . nevertheless, there is a common underlying mechanism producing circadian rhythms in these tissues based on transcriptional-translational feedback loops   <cit> . in the ttfl, the protein products of several genes inhibits their own transcription after associated delays due to transcription, translation and post-translational modification. after the identification of the scn master clock  <cit> , the first component of the ttfl was identified as the gene clock  <cit> .

subsequently, other “core” members of the ttfl, such as the repressors period  and cryptochrome , activators arntl  and npas <dig>  and nuclear receptors rev-erb  and ror  were established. there has been continued interest in finding new members of the ttfl not only for better understanding the mammalian circadian clock, but also because mutations in these core genes have been linked to several disorders  <cit> . while clock was discovered by costly and laborious forward genetic screens by joseph takahashi and colleagues  <cit> , current high-throughput data from genetics, transcriptomics and proteomics and availability of the entire genome combined with system biological approaches have tremendously accelerated our ability to find new putative members of the ttfl  <cit> . recently, anafi et al. used probabilistic machine learning to identify a putative clock member and subsequently experimentally verified it to discover the novel clock gene chrono  <cit> . similar bioinformatic approaches were used to identify novel circadian genes from microarray data  <cit>  and using co-expression data and text-mining  <cit> , to find circadian genes disrupted in cancer cell lines  <cit>  and to find health implications of disrupted clock genes  <cit> .

in this work, we aim to filter the list of a  <dig> putative clock genes from  <cit>  to determine the strongest candidates for further experimental validation. we do this by including other sources of high-throughput data, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing , proteomic and protein-protein interaction  data, not included in the original machine-learning procedure of  <cit> . we combined metrics for different data sources using a simple scoring scheme and shortlisted p <dig> cytochrome oxidoreductase , metastasis suppressor  <dig> , proviral integration site  <dig> , diacylglycerol o-acyltransferase  <dig> , protein phosphatase  <dig> regulatory sub-unit 3b  and uridine phosphorylase  <dig> .

method
we started our meta-analysis from the list of  <dig> putative clock genes identified by anafi et al. , henceforth referred to as the ‘master list’. anafi and colleagues compiled this master list by combining bayesian scores representing five features necessary in a clock gene:  oscillating transcripts in liver, pituitary and nih3t <dig> cells;  a circadian phenotype in response to rna interference  of the gene;  significant number of functional genetic interactions with an exemplar list of known “core” clock genes based on radiation hybrid mapping;  ubiquity of expression of the gene across multiple tissues based on expressed sequence tags ;  phylogenic conservation across fruit flies  and mammals. we exploit the wealth of available high-throughput genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data  on the circadian system not used by anafi et al. to further screen the master list for putative clock genes that are most worthy of experimental validation. we restricted our attention to data on mice , since circadian data sets are overwhelmingly based on the mouse model and therefore several time-resolved high quality circadian data sets are available . however, we included data from all mammals in the non-circadian ppi data sets. our data set selection criteria was to include all chip-seq data on circadian tfs, circadian proteomics data and ppi data on mice that was available when this meta-analysis was conducted.
the source of the published data, the characterized protein or transcription factor, the total number of binding sites for the chip-seq data and the number of genes corresponding to the quantified proteins in the case of proteomics or protein-protein interaction data are provided. when data could be filtered to include only circadian components, the number of genes with circadian chip-seq or proteomic evidence is also listed. finally, the total number of hits from each data set among the  <dig> gene long master list is given. the statistically overrepresented circadian hits are marked by significance  ∗:p< <dig> ,∗∗:p< <dig> ,∗∗∗:p< <dig> ,ns:not significant




chip-seq data
the rhythm generation in the circadian clock is a result of a ttfl, as described earlier. within the ttfl, clock genes acting as transcription factors mutually regulate each other. thus, it is likely that putative clock genes are transcriptionally regulated by known clock transcription factors , such as bmal <dig>  clock, npas <dig>  e4bp <dig>  ror α, rev-erb α and rev-erb β. therefore, we searched for chip-seq binding sites for each clock tf in the vicinity of the genes in the master list. moreover, when time-resolved binding of the tf factor was measured in a study, we restricted our attention further to only those chip-seq binding sites that show circadian  binding of the tf.

koike et al.  <cit>  provide time-resolved genome-wide chip-seq binding sampled every four hours over one day in mouse liver for the tfs bmal <dig>  clock, npas, cry <dig>  cry <dig>  per <dig> and per <dig> . it is worth noting that pers and crys do not possess dna binding domains, but we still retain the data as we believe that they might represent regulation by a complex composed of these important circadian proteins. we used the false discovery rates  for circadian binding from the original study to filter genes with circadian tf binding using a cutoff of  <dig> .

rey et al.  <cit>  similarly performed a detailed study of the genome-wide binding of activator bmal <dig> in the mouse liver sampled every four hours over one day . as before, we restricted our choice to gene with circadian bmal <dig> binding with a fdr< <dig> , based on a fisher test for periodicity as suggested by the authors of the study.

cho et al.  <cit>  compared the cistromes of both isoforms of the nuclear receptor repressor rev-erb  at a single time point  8) and against the cistrome of bmal <dig>  the raw chip-seq  was processed using the tftargetcaller  package in r  <cit>  to produce an annotated list of chip-seq peaks. although they discovered significant overlap between the binding sites of both isoforms, we retained the genes proximal to binding sites of each isoform, separately.

bugge et al.  <cit>  and feng et al.  <cit> , in related studies, investigated the role of nuclear-receptor repressors rev-erb α and rev-erb β in metabolism in the liver. they measured binding using chip-seq of both tfs at two time points,  <dig> hours apart. as before, we processed the raw chip-seq data  using the tftargetcaller  package in r  <cit>  to produce an annotated list of chip-seq peaks. since circadian binding cannot be reliably determined from two time points, we pooled binding sites from both time points for both tfs.

fang et al.  <cit> , recently, measured binding of the d-box repressor e4bp <dig>  and nuclear receptor activator  in the mouse liver at zt <dig> as part of a study on identifying functional circadian chip-seq binding sites. we processed their raw data  using homer   <cit>  for peak-calling and assigning peaks to the nearest gene.

proteomics data
a common feature of clock genes is that they are cycling both at the transcript as well as the protein level. the circadian nature of the former is already included in compiling the master list. subsequently, three studies of the circadian proteome were published and we use them as another source of data for screening.

robles et al.  <cit>  quantified the circadian proteome in the liver sampled at  <dig> time-points over two days under light-dark conditions. they used a stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture  combined with mass spectrometry  to find oscillating proteins. we included all genes whose proteins were determined to have significant oscillations with a  <dig>  fdr cut-off in the original study .

mauvoisin et al.  <cit>  performed a similar study of the liver proteome under light-dark conditions also using the silac-ms approach. with  <dig> samples over two days, we selected those gene whose proteins were deemed circadian with an fdr of  <dig>  according to the analysis in the study .

chiang et al.  <cit> , on the other hand, quantified the mouse scn proteome sampled at six time points over one day using silac combined a slightly different ms approach. the genes with time-of-day  variation in protein concentration were selected using a  <dig>  fdr cut-off .

it is interesting to note that none of the proteomics studies identified as circadian the core circadian proteins, such as the pers and crys, since their levels were too low to be detected using current techniques.

protein-protein interaction data
for a gene to be an integral part of the ttfl, it might interact at the protein level with known clock members. therefore, we complemented the gene interaction study used by anafi et al. with publicly available protein-protein interaction data. in particular, we searched for protein interactions with a list of  <dig> core circadian genes gathered by wallach et al.  <cit> . note that this list of core circadian genes is longer than the exemplar list of  <dig> used by anafi et al.  <cit> .

wallach et al.  <cit>  compiled the list of all proteins interacting with the  <dig> core circadian genes from the unified human interactome  database  <cit>  that was mined from  <dig> different sources using four different approaches. we looked for evidence of interactions between genes in the master list and these  <dig> core clock genes .

from the protein interaction network analysis  database , we were able to obtain complementary data on interactions identified in m. musculus alone that is similarly drawn from multiple public resources. as before, genes in the master list with at least one interaction with the  <dig> core clock genes were sought in the pina database.

combining the sources and scoring
we drew our data from multiple sources that are generated using different techniques, as described above, which makes integrating them a non-trivial task. it is particularly difficult to assign confidences to these different measurements. we therefore resorted to a very simple scoring scheme where the presence of a gene in a particular data set  gets a score of one and its absence, a score of zero, otherwise. thus, we give equal weight to a data set, whether chip-seq, proteomic or ppi. the only exception to this weighting rule is the data set from rey et al.  <cit> , which is given a weight of three, since it is a particularly detailed and thorough study of a central transcription factor .

whenever time-resolved data were available, we restricted our attention to binding, concentrations or interactions that were identified to be circadian at the appropriate statistical level . we mapped all protein data back to coding gene and assigned chip-seq peaks to the nearest gene, and used the entrez gene id as the common unified index for each gene ). the final score for each gene in the master list was computed as the sum of gene score within each constituent data set and reflects simply the number of studies that provide evidence supporting the circadian nature of that gene. a gene under this scheme can receive a maximum score of  <dig> 

we were able to attach a p-value to the total score for each gene using the following randomized shuffling procedure. we assigned the total number of hits obtained from each data set randomly to genes in the master list. iterating this procedure, we produced an empirical distribution of scores and the probability of achieving a more extreme total score  can be thus computed.

selecting genes robust to the choice of weighting scheme
we used a simple binary scoring scheme for each gene within a data set that resulted in a much heigher weight being assigned to the chip-seq data compared to the other two. we therefore tested if genes were particulary sensitive to the relative choice of weights for the different types of data sets. we therefore introduced pre-factors for each class of data: α for chip-seq, β for proteomic, and γ for protein-protein interaction , respectively. then, the total score for a gene g for this choice of pre-factors is 
 s=α+β+γ=α∑chip-seqdataiii+β∑proteomicsdatajij+γ∑ppi datakik,  where il is one, if the gene g is present in a data set l, zero if it is not. we further fix α+β+γ= <dig> 

our original scoring described above and in additional file  <dig> is equivalent to a choice of equal pre-factors for all three classes, i.e., α=β=γ= <dig>  we then altered each pre-factor randomly while restricting changes to at most  <dig> % above or below the original equal pre-factors. in other words, we generate random , such that  <dig> <α,β,γ< <dig> . care was taken while generating these random pre-factors to ensure that the pre-factors were truly uniformly distributed over the simplex. finally, for each random choice of pre-factors, we computed a background distribution of scores s using the randomized shuffling procedure while keeping the  fixed. significant candidate genes for that particular choice of pre-factors were those genes with a p-value < <dig> . finally, we retained only genes that were found to be significant in each of  <dig> random choices of . this list of genes was thus robust to variations in the choice of pre-factors and are listed in fig.  <dig> 
fig.  <dig> data mining approach to find novel clock candidate genes. the schematic outlines the approach along with the types of data sources used to filter the master list of  <dig> genes from anafi et al.  <cit>  to the list of  <dig> novel candidate clock genes. some key properties of the novel candidates genes are also indicated. the entire list of robust and non-robust candidate genes are given in table s <dig> in additional file 2




model of phase regulation of genes by combinations of transcription factors
we processed the mrna transcript time series data from  <cit>   using jtkcycle  <cit>  to obtain phases of master list genes. we then grouped the chip-seq data sets  into e-box activators , d-box repressor , and rre regulators . we used the chip-seq components in the table of scores  to construct scores for each tf group regulating a gene by summing all chip-seq scores for that tf group in the table of scores and normalizing each score by the maximum score attainable within that tf group. each gene was thus associated with three scores, se, sd and srre, for the e-box, d-box and rre tf groups, respectively, that all take values between zero and one.

we fit a type of generalized linear model  for the phase of gene transcripts with the three scores as predictors. since transcript phase is a circular dependent variable , we needed a link function to relate the linear predictor based on the three scores to the transcript phase. the circular variable is assumed to have a von mises distribution whose mean is linked to the linear regressors via an ‘arctan’ link function as suggested in  <cit> : 
 e=μ+2arctancese+cdsd+crresrre, 

where ϕgene is the wrapped gene phase in ct and the model parameters include the unregulated mean phase μ of the genes and the contributions of the three scores to the linear regressor . the concentration parameter of the von mises distribution κ is assumed to be constant and independent of the tf scores and is also estimated . the glm was fit using iteratively-weighted least squares implemented in the circular package in r.

RESULTS
candidate genes identified by the meta-analysis
the meta-analysis approach outlined in fig.  <dig> yielded a table of scores for the  <dig> genes in the master list , which is one of the primary results of this work. the chip-seq data sets contributed the largest number of hits to the master list and hence, was the largest contributor to the total score . the proteomic and ppi data sets had limited effect on the total score. based on the chip-seq data sets, genes in the master list were mostly bound by transcription factors  via rre and to a lesser extent at e-boxes and d-boxes . it must be noted, that the e-box binding tfs satisfied the stringent criteria of binding chromatin in a circadian manner, while the rest were based on experiments performed at one or two circadian phases.

we tested whether the presence of a gene in any of the data sets assembled in this study is predictive of high ranks in the original evidence factor-based ranking of anafi et al.  <cit> . interestingly, presence of circadian bmal <dig> binding  <cit>  , or circadian proteome according to  <cit>  , or identified ppis with any clock protein in mouse or humans  were all significantly predictive of high ranks. overall, we found a significant but weak positive association between the original ranking and a ranking based on our score . thus, the data sets incorporated in this work are broadly consistent with the master list from  <cit> .

thirty-one genes in the master list  obtained statistically significant total scores based on the randomized shuffling procedure, where a total score of  <dig> was significant at the  <dig>  level . we used this rather stringent threshold to compensate for the inherent correlation in the scores between data sets  that is unaccounted for in the shuffling procedure.

our simple scoring of genes results in chip-seq data sets contributing the most to the total score of each gene, as described above. we therefore compensated for this effect by pruning out genes from the list of  <dig> statistically significant scoring genes that were not robust to the choice of relative weights for the chip-seq, proteomic and ppi data sets . after pruning, we were left with  <dig> robust candidate clock-associated genes  that included nine known clock-associated genes. in fact, all the known clock-associated genes in the list of significant scorers  were robust to the weighting scheme. further, our candidate list contained  <dig> out of  <dig> ‘core’ clock genes defined by ueda and colleagues  <cit>  .

among the  <dig> novel robust candidate genes, all except tomm <dig> had a rhythmic transcript in at least one tissue  <cit>  and five genes  had a significantly rhythmic protein product in at least one of the three proteomic studies . in line with the overall trends identified earlier, most novel genes were predominated by chip-seq binding of clock tfs with little evidence in the proteomic or ppi studies. moreover,  <dig> of the  <dig> robust candidate genes featured in the top  <dig> ‘circadian’ genes in  <cit>  including six known clock genes . the novel robust candidates in the top  <dig> were por, azin <dig>  and gys <dig>  curiously, we observed a bimodal distribution of evidence-based ranks among these  <dig> robust candidates , with genes falling in the top or bottom of the anafi et al. list. lima <dig>  fam20a and ppp1r3b constitute robust candidates that were indeed ranked in the bottom  <dig>  where our meta-analysis adds novelty to the candidate list.

motivated by the close association between the circadian clock and metabolism, we checked if candidate gene products catalyzed metabolic reactions using the kegg database  <cit> . por, gne, upp <dig>  gys <dig> and etnk <dig> were robust candidate genes with enzymatic functions, while dgat <dig>  pik3r <dig> and chka were significantly high-scoring, but non-robust, genes with a metabolic role. however, only upp <dig> and gys <dig> were directly involved in catalyzing reactions with at least one substrate with circadian variation in abundance  in the mouse liver  <cit> . however, no substrate of candidate genes were circadian in the human metabolome in the saliva  <cit> .

candidate gene transcripts in different tissues
we next compared our meta-analysis to the recently published high-resolution micro-array and rna-sequencing study of the circadian transcriptome in  <dig> tissues  <cit> . recall that the original master list was compiled using an earlier microarray circadian transcriptome study in just three tissues  <cit>  and with the intention of finding genes with ubiquitously circadian transcripts. therefore, it was surprising to find that only  <dig> out of the  <dig> master list genes had a circadian transcript  in at least one tissue in  <cit> .

nevertheless, the total score was reasonably correlated  with the number of tissues in which the gene transcript was significantly circadian , even with the simple scoring methodology used here. when we considered individual components of the score, we found that e-box binding, circadian protein expression and ppi with clock genes to be the most significant predictors of genes transcribed in a circadian manner in multiple tissues , though rre binding also played a, albeit less significant, role . moreover, bmal <dig> and rev-erb α,β appeared to be the main e-box and rre transcription factors, respectively, responsible for driving oscillations in many tissues.

the  <dig> robust candidate genes were significantly over-representative of genes that were circadian in many tissues  . more than  <dig> % of the candidate genes were expressed in a circadian manner in at least four tissues, while this reduces to  <dig> % among the low-scoring non-robust non-significant genes . in addition, when robust candidate genes were sorted in descending order of the number of tissues in which they showed circadian transcripts, eight of the nine known clock-associated genes were at the top of this list. interestingly, significantly high-scoring non-robust genes were also generally expressed in many tissues and exhibited similar properties to the robust candidates .

when we consider the regulated phases of only significant circadian transcripts , we noticed that genes in the master list were expressed uniformly throughout the day with a slight bias towards ct23-ct24/ <dig> . however, transcript phases  of robust candidate genes were strongly concentrated around ct9- <dig> . remarkably, the circadian transcripts of candidate genes in different tissues shared the same phase of peak expression  with very few exceptions. in fact, candidate genes  that were circadian in at least five tissues showed a very high degree of expression phase coherence . the exceptions were mostly genes expressed in four or fewer tissues, such as chka and mtss <dig>  for example, mtss <dig> and chka showed distinctly different phase of expression in the heart as compared to the other three tissues in which they were expressed in a circadian manner .

regulation of master list genes by circadian transcription factors
in the mammalian transcriptome, few circadian tfs appear to regulate many circadian transcripts with a wide variety of expression phases throughout the circadian cycle . one hypothesis of circadian phase regulation is that different circadian genes are regulated by different subsets  of tfs. this results in different phases of expression of the regulated genes, since each circadian tf has its peak expression at a different time of day . we examined this hypothesis of whether binding of certain tfs was indicative of phase-specific transcript regulation using the chip-seq data on different circadian tfs and the transcript phase of master list genes. in particular, we assumed in this analysis that chip-seq binding of tfs in the mouse liver is highly representative of binding of those tfs in other tissues. this allowed us to pool circadian phases of significant transcripts from all  <dig> tissues  <cit>  in order to get sufficient sample sizes in each combination of tfs.

we grouped the chip data sets  into e-box activators , d-box repressor , and rre regulators . we were able to combine rre activator and repressors, since the rre activators and repressors were expressed  <dig> h apart  . in other words, the peak of the rre activator and nadir of the rre repressor occur approximately simultaneously and vice-versa, thus, making their effects on gene transcription similar. based on this classification, we expect activation via each regulator group to peak when the corresponding tf peaks .

we first qualitatively compared the presence or absence of these regulatory features of genes against the phase distribution of the transcripts . transcripts regulated by only e-box elements were likely to peak around dusk , while only rre regulated transcripts peaked commonly around dawn . for reference, rev-erbβ is a typical e-box gene that peaks at c <dig> and bmal <dig> is a typical rre regulated gene that peaks at ct <dig>  genes in this list regulated by both elements showed a spread of transcripts phases throughout the day with a bias towards dusk-phased e-box genes. few genes in the master list were regulated either by d-boxes alone or by a combination of e- and d-boxes and hence, no conclusions could be drawn on them. the confluence of repression by a dusk-phased d-box regulator and rre regulators produced an even stronger peak of expression at ct22- <dig>  finally, regulation by all three groups of tfs produced two equally strong peaks of expression at dawn and dusk.

we computed normalized scores for the regulation of each gene by the different tf groups based on the chip-seq data  and then a regression between the expression phase of the gene  against a linear combination of the scores . we assumed that genes with higher scores, i.e., more consensus within the chip-seq data sets for a tf, also have higher affinity for the particular tf. the fitted model of phase regulation was as follows: 
  mean gene phase = <dig> +2arctan− <dig> se+ <dig> sd+ <dig> srre, 

where se,sd,srre are the chip-seq scores for e-box, d-box and rre regulators respectively. the model parameter estimates were significant at the  <dig>  level and the concentration parameter of the phase distribution was estimated to be  <dig>  .

the predicted phase distribution for genes regulated by different combination of tfs from the fitted model in  is shown in fig. 4b. the model fits are consistent with the qualitative observations in fig. 4a. the model eq.  <dig> reveals that the mean expression of genes unregulated by these tfs in the master list is ct <dig>  genes with higher e-box scores progressively decrease the gene phase from ct <dig>  i.e., move them towards dusk. on the other hand, d-box and rre regulation increase the gene phase from ct <dig>  i.e., move them towards dawn. however, e-box scores have a larger effect on phase than d-box and rre scores. finally, the model can be used to predict the phase of expression for other genes, if chip-seq data are available to estimate their scores.

discussion
we presented in this paper a meta-analysis , where we integrated circadian chip-seq, proteomics and protein-protein interaction  data with the recently published machine learning-based selection of putative circadian genes from transcriptomic data, small interference rna  screens and genomic conservation data  <cit> . our goal was to screen for novel candidate genes bioinformatically using publicly available data sources. this analysis produced a table of scores  for the  <dig> potential circadian genes from  <cit> . interestingly, we found no strong correlation between our ranking based on gene scores and the ranking of anafi et al., suggesting that two sets of sources provide complementary insights into the circadian nature of the genes. the anafi et al. ranking reflects mainly transcriptional rhythmicity and as such the chip-seq data would be expected to be consistent with it, since they relate to the same process of transcription. however, binding to the chromatin is not always functional and unless the activity of the tf is also circadian, binding of circadian tfs does not necessitate circadian transcription. this nevertheless represents an inherent limitation of chip-seq data and is a caveat to our entire study. on the other hand, proteomics and ppi are truly independent data sources, since they represent altogether different cellular processes from transcription. we therefore expect that our three data sources do provide new information as compared to  <cit>  to further filter these genes.

the chip-seq data consisted of the largest number of different sources and predictably had the strongest influence on the scores. the three categories of tfs, e-box binding, rre binding and d-box binding were all individually influential and gave hits in the master list . although there were few genes in the master list with a circadian protein expression, they were significantly over-represented in the master list. this can be attributed to the few circadian proteins identified overall in those studies  <cit> , where low concentrations make quantification of most known core circadian genes difficult. the ppi with known core clock genes also provided sparse hits within the  <dig> master list genes. nevertheless, hits from ppi, bmal <dig> and rev-erb α,β chip-seq and circadian proteomics data sets were predictive of both original evidence-based ranking and rhythmic transcriptome in the mouse liver, pituitary and nih3t <dig> cells as quantified by  <cit> . thus, despite the low correlation between scoring methodologies alluded to earlier, the newly integrated data appear to be consistent with the original data sources.

we verified our approach against the recently published rna-sequencing study on the circadian transcriptome in multiple tissues  <cit> , which was not used in our study. surprisingly, only about  <dig> % of genes in the master list were circadian in at least one of fourteen tissues. nevertheless, we found that high gene scores in our meta-analysis was indicative of robust circadian transcripts in multiple tissues. this supports the ability of our analysis methodology to find potential clock-associated genes, since we expect candidate clock genes to be ubiquitously circadian. consistent with conclusions based on data of  <cit> , we found bmal <dig> and rev-erb α,β were predictive of circadian rhythms in multiple tissues along with interaction with known circadian proteins and oscillating protein expression. this suggests that e-boxes and rre repressors might be major drivers of the circadian transcriptome in multiple tissues.

we therefore compared the phases of the robust circadian transcriptome  in multiple tissues in  <cit>  against the analyzed chip-seq data for e-box activators, d-box repressor and rre regulators in order to check for characteristic patterns of phase regulation by these tfs. one remarkable feature was that the transcript phase for at least the master list genes were quite consistent across  <dig> tissues. consistent with expectations, we found that genes with only rre binding were likely to peak around dawn , whereas e-box only bound genes were likely to peak at around dusk . those genes with binding at both e-boxes and rres showed a mixture of phases between dawn and dusk. moreover, we observed that the d-box repressor regulated most master list genes only in conjunction with rres, where they enhanced dawn-phase expression, since the effect of both regulators were in-phase. indeed, fang et al.  <cit>  showed that this d-box repressor  works downstream of rev-erb α,β. the presence of all three regulator types produces both dawn and dusk-phase expression.

the amount of consensus between the different chip-seq sources in our meta-analysis was used to measure the affinity of tfs to particular genes as a score. the e-boxes, d-boxes and rres scores for each gene were then used as predictors of the expression phase of the gene via a model. this model provided a statistically significant fit to the data and described how the presence of the different tfs quantitatively tuned the expression phase of a gene . it must be borne in mind that for this analysis of phase regulation, we pooled all the transcript phases and assumed that chip-seq binding in the liver implies similar binding in all tissues. moreover, since the master list was itself obtained from a machine-learning-based search for novel clock genes  <cit> , this list might not be representative of the entire circadian transcriptome.

we found  <dig> candidate genes with highly significant scores in our meta-analysis that were also robust to the choice of relative weights for the chip-seq, proteomics and ppi data. nine known clock-associated genes were included in these  <dig> genes, serving as a sanity-check for our approach. although there were abundant chip-seq hits among these robust candidate genes, the few ppi hits were present only for known clock genes and circadian protein expression was restricted to por, gne, mtss <dig> upp <dig> and ppp1r3b. the intersection of the top  <dig> genes in  <cit>  and these candidate genes yielded four novel genes: por, azin <dig>  and gys <dig>  most known clock-associated robust candidates received high ranks in  <cit> , while others that received quite low ranks were the truly novel candidates identified in this study, such as mtss <dig> and ppp1r3b . several novel robust candidate genes had protein products that had an enzymatic role in metabolism. this is not unexpected as most of the data used in our meta-analysis were gathered from the liver, which is known to have a very important role in metabolism. however, only upp <dig> and gys <dig> catalyzed reactions with a substrate with circadian variation in abundance in the mouse liver  <cit>  and none of the substrates were circadian in humans  <cit> .

these  <dig> robust candidate genes were also statistically expressed in more number of tissues than other master list genes based on circadian transcriptomics data  <cit> . since known clock genes are generally expressed in many tissues, this is indeed a desirable feature for candidate clock-associated genes. in addition to the remarkable consistency of expression phases of gene transcripts in tissues in which they are significantly circadian, transcripts of candidate genes were enriched for peaks at dusk  suggestive of e-box regulation. the similarity in the phase of candidate genes across tissues sets them apart from circadian output genes that are suggested to be regulated in a tissue-specific manner  <cit> .

we next discuss specific candidate genes that might be the most rewarding to be studied experimentally based on a combination of factors including circadian protein expression, number of tissues in which their transcript is circadian  and their robustness to the choice of weights for the different data classes .

nadph-cytochrome p <dig> oxidoreductase  had a rhythmic transcript in nine tissues  with an average phase of ct <dig> and was the only gene in our candidate gene list with a circadian protein concentration in both liver proteomic data sets. por is a flavoprotein responsible for electron transfer from nadph to all p <dig> enzymes in microsomes. while por knockout in mice is embryonic lethal  <cit> , conditional knockout of por in the liver affects lipid metabolism and homeostatis and results in hepatic lipidosis  <cit> . recently, johnson et al.  <cit>  showed that ablation of the liver circadian clock affects the levels of por expression, protein and activity, which in turn likely plays in role in regulating hepatotoxicity caused by acetaminophen. based on the analysis of the chip-seq data, the por promoter is bound by three types of clock tfs, e-box regulators , rre regulators  and d-box repressor .

metastasis supressor  <dig>  was expressed in a circadian manner in four tissues  with an average phase of ct <dig> and cycling protein levels in one liver study  <cit> . mtss <dig> was identified as a potential tumor suppressor as it was not expressed in human bladder cancer cell lines  <cit>  and involved in signaling in other carcinomas. it also plays a role in cytoskeleton dynamics by interacting with actin filaments  <cit> . since it is strongly expressed in the liver, mtss <dig> was identified as circadian gene with different phase of expression in rats and mice based on early microarray transcriptomic studies  <cit> . moreover, mtss <dig> was only candidate gene that displayed significantly different phase of expression between tissues. while the mtss <dig> gene promoter certainly binds e-box regulators , rre activator  and d-box repressor , the evidence of regulation by the rre repressors  was mixed between two studies  <cit> .

another oncogene, proviral integration site  <dig> pim <dig> was expressed with consistent phase  across six tissues without being detected in either proteomic study. pim <dig> encodes a kinase that is upregulated in many cancer cell lines  <cit>  and downregulation of pim <dig> retarted cell proliferation in human hepatoma cell lines  <cit> . further, pim <dig> appears to play a role in glucose homeostatis by downregulating insulin-secretion in response to glucose, thus making pim3−/− mice tolerant to glucose in vivo. in the circadian context, pim <dig> was identified as a light-induced immediate-early gene in the scn  <cit>  making it important also in the function of master circadian clock consistent with the bioinformatic prediction that pim <dig> has a conserved cre element its promoter  <cit> . the promoter of pim <dig> binds d-box repressor  and the rre-regulators , but there is inconsistency in the binding of e-box tf  between the two studies.

diacylglycerol o-acyltransferase  <dig> dgat <dig> did not exhibit any cycling in protein levels, but showed transcript oscillations with an average phase of ct <dig> in six tissues. dgat <dig> is responsible for the synthesis of triglycerides from diacylglycerol. moreover, dgat <dig> is directly regulated by the cardiomyocyte circadian clock and participates in the response of the heart to fatty acids  <cit> . the e-box activators  and rre repressors , but not the d-box repressor  or rre activator , bind the dgat <dig> promoter. the choice of dgat <dig> is also supported by an independent rnai study  <cit>  performed by maier and colleagues , where a significant one hour period lengthening was observed in u2os cells in response to the gene knockdown. this rnai phenotype led to the choice of dgat <dig> although it was not robust to the choice of weighting scheme .

next, we consider a protein phosphatase  regulatory subunit 3b of pp <dig> ppp1r3b that was a robust candidate gene. pp1r3b suppresses the glycogen phosphorylase activity of pp <dig> and enhanced its glycogen synthase activity. although ppp1r3b was expressed in a circadian manner in fewer tissues than the previous four genes, the knockdown of the gene displayed a significant long period phenotype  in an independent rnai study  <cit>  on human u2os cells. pp <dig>  a known clock component  <cit> , affects the period of the mammalian circadian clock  <cit>  and is known to target per <dig>  <cit> . nevertheless, none of the catalytic subunits of pp <dig> is transcriptionally circadian in any tissue. this might indeed be novel layer of the clock regulation by pp <dig> by means of a circadian regulatory subunit ppp1r3b.

finally, uridine phosphorylase  <dig>  was a robust candidate gene in our meta-analysis. upp <dig> is a particularly interesting candidate, since it is an example of a circadian protein that is also a metabolic enzyme. eckel-mahan et al.  <cit>  showed that upp <dig> acted on two circadian metabolites  and thus is one of the few known common nodes between circadian transcriptome and circadian metabolome  <cit> . while upp <dig> has been shown to be a clock output gene in the liver  <cit> , our meta-analysis revealed that upp <dig> was robustly circadian in the kidney too with the same phase as in the liver . interestingly, in humans, upp <dig> is expressed more in the kidney than in the liver  <cit> . therefore, it might be interesting to study the circadian role of upp <dig> further, in addition to the known metabolic context in the liver.

CONCLUSIONS
we combined multiple high-throughput public data sources of circadian data to filter the shortlist of  <dig> potential circadian genes from  <cit>  to obtain  <dig> novel robust candidate genes. in particular, we suggested por, mtss <dig>  pim <dig>  dgat <dig>  ppp1r3b and upp <dig> for further experimental studies as potential clock genes. these genes appear to have a role in either metabolism or cancer or stress response making them a potential link between the circadian clock and these physiological processes. we also showed from the different chip-seq data that phase regulation of transcription of circadian genes is driven by specific transcription factors in a combinatorial manner consistent across multiple tissues.

although we focused our discussion on the significant candidate genes, we have assigned scores based on our analysis for the all  <dig> shortlisted genes that can serve as a starting point to integrate additional data sources as they or tools to integrate them  become available. in order to keep the scoring in the meta-analysis simple we used binary scoring of hits from various data sources. a bayesian analysis might be performed in order to consistently combine final scores from  <cit>  for a better consolidated final ranking. meta-analyses of the ever growing publicly available data targeted at different aspects of the regulatory network has the potential to aid functional network discovery in the circadian and other contexts and utilize these data to their fullest potential.
