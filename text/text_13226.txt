BACKGROUND
ancestry informative markers  are the genetic markers carrying ancestral information for classifying samples from a specific population or various ethnic populations  <cit> . aims have been applied to various study areas, including population genetics, forensic sciences, medical genetics, and others. in population genetics, aims can be used to estimate the genetic diversity, population differentiation, and admixture proportions and thereby provide a more detailed understanding of the genetic background of study populations  <cit> . in forensic sciences, aims can be used to infer ancestral or continental origin and thereby assist with victim identification in a disaster situation or criminal identification in a venue  <cit> . in medical genetics, aims are useful for reducing false positives and false negatives in genetic association studies. on the one hand, aims can assist in adjusting for potential genetic substructures in a case–control association study and thereby reduce false positives   <cit> . on the other hand, aims can also be used to construct homogeneous sample groups in a genetic association study and thereby reduce false negatives   <cit> . in addition, aims can provide complementary information for self-reported ethnicity. in contrast to self-reported ethnicity, which reflects an individual’s environment and culture, aim-determined ethnicity inferred from genetic markers reflects genetic inheritance and make-up. in particular, self-reported ethnicity may be challenged when samples have been recruited from a geographic region in which the residents are highly admixed  <cit> . therefore, aim-determined ethnicity, rather than self-reported ethnicity, is recommended for genetic studies; admixture mapping using aims is especially suitable for highly admixed populations  <cit> .

short tandem repeat polymorphisms  and single nucleotide polymorphisms  are the most frequently used genetic markers for aims, and each has its own strengths  <cit> . genotyping platforms for genome-wide strp and snp markers have been established but are not specific to aims, and this significantly increases the average genotyping cost for aims. this urgent need motivates the development of aim panels that contain as much ancestral information as possible, while keeping the number of aims as low as possible. aim panels with a small to moderate number of genetic markers have been constructed to discern samples from different populations, including europeans  <cit> , east asians  <cit> , african americans  <cit> , and european americans  <cit> , and different continents  <cit>  at a more reasonable price.

although a small to moderate number of snps or strps could provide promising discriminative power to distinguish a large ethnic discrepancy , it becomes very challenging to classify samples from closely related ancestral lineage  using only a small number of snps. in an example of a previous classification study  <cit> , the hapmap ii asian, african and european samples were separated with a classification accuracy of  <dig>  based on  <dig> snps on average. the number of snps increased to  <dig> but the classification accuracy was reduced to  <dig>  on average if han chinese and japanese samples were further regarded as samples from different sub-asian populations and classified with african and european samples jointly. this difficulty to classify the samples from proximate populations could be overcome by using a large number of genetic markers  <cit> , while genotyping cost will increase significantly.

gene expression  microarray technology has advanced in the past 20 years. previous studies have shown that ge also is polymorphic and heritable variation in humans  <cit> . importantly, ge exhibits different genetic/genomic profiles in different ethnic populations  <cit> . similar to snp markers, ge markers may potentially provide ancestral information for discriminating samples from different ethnic populations. of note, the different natures of snp and ge markers may mean that ge provides information that is supplementary to snp information: ge markers are quantitative attributes responsible for gene regulation, and snp markers may act as semi-quantitative  or qualitative  variables that can be attributed to dna variation. regarding the relationship between snp and ge markers, the regulation of ge may be unrelated to dna sequences, as with epigenetic mechanisms  <cit> , or it may be associated with snps, as with expression quantitative trait locus   <cit> ; nevertheless, even in the case of an eqtl, only a limited proportion of ge variation can be explained by the eqtl. therefore, in this study, we proposed that integrative analysis of these two types of genetic markers  may provide a more promising alternative for construction of a high-accuracy and cost-beneficial aim panel than analysis of snp or ge markers alone. to the best of our knowledge, few  studies in the literature have integrated ge markers with snp markers to aid in subdividing samples from different ethnic populations. in this study, we investigated the performance of snp and ge markers in population genetics and evaluated the plausibility of sample classification using the combined resources of snp and ge data.

samples and genotyping/gene expression experiments
in this study, we analyzed snp and ge data in  <dig> independent samples from the international hapmap ii project  <cit> . the samples encompassed  <dig> african marriage pairs from yoruba in ibadan ,  <dig> caucasian marriage pairs of european descent resided in utah , and  <dig> asian persons including  <dig> han chinese persons in beijing  and  <dig> japanese persons in tokyo . all  <dig> samples were genotyped using both the affymetrix human mapping 500 k and array  <dig>  . the two snp gene chips provided genotype data for  <dig>  snps and  <dig>  snps, respectively, on  <dig> pairs of chromosomes for each individual. the bayesian robust linear model with mahalanobis distance classifier   <cit>  or birdseed  <cit>  were used for snp genotype call analysis of data from the affymetrix human mapping 500 k and array  <dig> , respectively. the genotype data are publicly available . in addition, ge levels of the  <dig> hapmap samples were measured using illumina’s sentrix human- <dig> expression beadchip . each bead chip provided  <dig>  transcript probes for the human genome  <cit> . procedures for quantification and normalization of ge levels are described in supporting online materials  <cit> . the normalized gene expression data are publicly available in the gene expression omnibus  database  . annotation of snp data from the affymetrix 500 k and array  <dig>  was derived from the netaffx annotation update  <dig> , which is available on the affymetrix website . annotation of ge probes was derived from the geo annotation , which is available in the geo database.

statistical methods and data analysis
this study classified samples in each of eight combinations of the four ethnic populations:  “four populations” – chb, jpt, ceu, and yri;  “three populations” – asian , caucasian , and african ;  “chb and jpt”;  “chb and yri”;  “chb and ceu”;  “jpt and yri”;  “jpt and ceu”; and  “yri and ceu”. quality control of snp and ge markers was performed together with analysis for each of the eight combinations of ethnic populations. a poor-quality snp was removed if its genotype call rate was lower than  <dig> , its minor allele frequency was  <dig>  or if hardy-weinberg equilibrium  was violated, where departure from hwe was defined as a p-value that was adjusted by a false discovery rate procedure  <cit>  and that was lower than  <dig>  in a permutation-based hwe test  <cit> . finally, snps on sex chromosomes were removed. quality control of ge markers removed  <dig>  non-refseq probes . a total of  <dig> probes were removed from sex chromosomes, and  <dig>  probes without gene information also were removed. the total numbers of snp and ge markers that remained after snp and ge quality control are shown .

to explore the genetic discrepancy and sample subdivisions among the four hapmap ii populations, an exploratory unsupervised analysis was performed, followed by an intensive supervised classification analysis. both analyses used genome-wide snp and ge markers. first, to understand whether genome-wide snp and ge markers provide sufficient information for subdividing samples in hapmap ii populations, a preliminary unsupervised classification analysis was performed by drawing allele frequency biplots and gene expression biplots based on genome-wide snp and ge markers, respectively. the analysis was performed using aloha software  <cit> , which is available on the aloha website . afterward, intensive supervised classification analyses were performed to identify key snp and/or ge markers to study subdivisions of samples from the hapmap ii populations. a five-step discriminant analysis was developed to identify key snp and/or ge markers with the highest prediction accuracy for the separation of samples from different populations as follows. first, samples in each study population were randomly partitioned into  <dig> subsets for cross-validation. second, a flexible discriminant analysis  using optimal scoring  <cit>  was applied to training sets . given the existing markers in a classification model, new snp or ge markers with the maximum increment of training accuracy were added sequentially to the model. the marker with the minimum ssw/ssb was selected if more than one marker or marker set had the same training accuracy, where ssw and ssb indicate the within-population and between-population sum of squares for genotypic values or gene expression levels, respectively. the procedure continued until the training accuracy reached  <dig>  or its increment was less than a threshold such as  <dig>  in this study. third, genetic markers with the highest training accuracy were used to classify individuals in the testing dataset  and the testing accuracy then was calculated. fourth, the first three steps were repeated until each of the  <dig> subsets had been analyzed as a testing dataset, resulting in  <dig> classification candidate models. finally, among the  <dig> classification models, the one with the highest testing accuracy or highest cross-validation consistency was selected as the best classification model. the aforementioned classification analysis was performed for each of the eight ethnic population combinations using only ge markers , only snp markers on affymetrix 500 k , only snp markers on affymetrix array  <dig>  , both ge markers and snps on affymetrix 500 k , and both ge markers and snps on affymetrix array <dig>  . the analysis was performed using our developed software, biasless , which can be downloaded for free at http://www.stat.sinica.edu.tw/hsinchou/genetics/prediction/biasless.htm.

RESULTS
unsupervised classification analysis using genome-wide snp or ge markers
the genome-wide snp-based classification analysis clearly separated samples from ethnic populations using allele frequency profiling of genome-wide snps interrogated on affymetrix 500 k  or affymetrix array  <dig>  . samples from chb, jpt, ceu, and yri were classified into three genetically distant ethnic groups, african, caucasian, and asian. the asian group consisted of two genetically close populations   that were separated further by within-group analysis of asian populations . all two-population analyses accurately separated samples from different populations . in general, the results of the affymetrix 500 k and affymetrix array  <dig>  analyses were very similar . in contrast to the genome-wide snp-based analysis, a non-negligible proportion of samples could not be separated correctly with genome-wide ge markers . these results were found not only for samples from the four populations  but also for samples from any two populations .

supervised classification analysis by selecting key predictive snp and/or ge markers from genome-wide snp and ge markers
ten classification models were established in each of the ge-only, 500 k-only, array <dig> -only, 500 k + ge, and array <dig>  + ge analyses, which independently identified a small number of key predictive snp and/or ge markers to classify samples for each of the eight ethnic population combinations that we studied. the distributions of testing accuracy and number of predictive markers are presented in box-whisker plots . the majority of the classification analyses produced an average testing accuracy, calculated over  <dig> cross-validation datasets, greater than or close to 90%, with the exception of two snp-only analyses; the 500 k-only and array <dig> -only analyses had relatively low testing accuracies for the classification of samples from two closely related ethnic populations, chb and jpt. in the 500 k-only analysis, the average testing accuracies were only  <dig>  and  <dig>  for classifying samples from “chb and jpt” and from “four populations”, respectively. similarly, in the array <dig> -only analysis, the average testing accuracies were only  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the classification of samples from “chb and jpt” and “four populations”, respectively. however, if ge markers also were integrated together with snp markers for the classification of samples from “chb and jpt” and “four populations”, the average testing accuracies increased to  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, in the 500 k + ge analysis and to  <dig>  and  <dig>  in the array <dig>  + ge analysis. in comparison with the integrative analyses of snp and ge markers, the ge-only analysis presented a larger variation of testing accuracy and required about twice the number of markers to accurately classify samples from “jpt and yri”, “yri and ceu”, “three populations” and “four populations”.

we established the best classification models in the ge-only, 500 k-only, array <dig> -only, 500 k + ge, and array <dig>  + ge analyses for each of the eight ethnic population combinations we studied . the best models of the integrative analysis of snp and ge markers attained a testing accuracy of 100% in all eight population combinations that we studied. only a few markers were needed for good sample classification. in the 500 k + ge analysis, the number of predictive markers was five for “four populations”, three for “three populations”, three for “chb and jpt”, two for “jpt and ceu”, and one for the remaining population combinations; in the array <dig>  + ge analysis, the number of predictive markers required in the best model was five for “four populations”, three for “three populations”, three for “chb and jpt”, and one for the remaining population combinations.

notably, the best models in the 500 k + ge and array <dig>  + ge analyses only required  <dig> or  <dig> snps to correctly classify samples from genetically distant populations, including “chb and yri”, “chb and ceu”, “jpt and yri”, “jpt and ceu”, and “yri and ceu”. the results show the existence of ancestry informative or population-specific snps; namely, the snp-only analysis already provided key information, and ge markers were redundant in this situation, as follows: snp rs <dig>  for “chb and yri”, rs <dig>  for “chb and ceu”, rs <dig>  for “jpt and yri”, rs <dig>  for “jpt and ceu”, and rs <dig>  for “yri and ceu” . one or two snps already provided sufficient information for classifying ethnically distant samples, but this was not the case for classifying samples from ethnically close populations such as chb and jpt. in the latter situation, the integrative analyses of snp and ge markers indeed provided much richer information than the snp-only analyses. the best model of the affy500k + ge analysis, which was composed of gi_4506928-s , gi_37540521-s , and rs <dig>  significantly improved the testing accuracy of the affy500k analysis when classifying samples from chb and jpt; the testing accuracy of the best model increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the best model of the array <dig>  + ge analysis, which was composed of gi_4506928-s , gi_37540521-s , and rs <dig>  significantly improved the testing accuracy of the array <dig>  analysis; the testing accuracy of the best model increased from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

all samples from the four study populations could also be classified correctly with the best models of the integrative analyses of snp and ge markers. in comparison with the snp-only and ge-only analyses, the best integrative model of snp and ge markers used only four snp markers and one ge marker to perfectly classify samples from the four populations that we studied . the 500 k + ge analysis prioritized rs <dig>  gi_41281459-s , rs <dig>  rs <dig> , and rs <dig> as the key predictive markers; the array <dig>  + ge analysis identified rs <dig>  gi_4506928-s , rs <dig>  rs <dig> and rs <dig> as the key predictive markers in the best classification model.

discussion
the concept conveyed by the proposed integrative analysis of snp and ge markers also is applicable to predicting disease status in biomedical studies and drug response in pharmacogenomics studies. genome-wide association studies that identify disease susceptibility genes using a large number of snps suffer from the problem of missing heritability and are limited in explaining the etiology of complex diseases  <cit> . however, with the aid of ge, it is possible to increase the proportion of explained genetic variations which then elevates prediction accuracy. in view of the potential importance of integrative analysis of snp and ge markers in the population genetics, forensic sciences, and medical genetics, we developed biasless software. biasless, which is useful for selecting important predictive marker sets from large numbers of biomarkers for inferences of ethnic groups, disease groups, and drug response groups, is a free, publicly available, and user-friendly analysis tool.

the method and software introduced in this paper can be used to construct high-accuracy and cost-beneficial aim panels. nevertheless, rather than the construction of aim panels, the main focus of this paper is to introduce an integrative analysis of snp and ge markers for the discrimination of samples from various populations, especially for closely related ancestral lineages. we don’t intend for the aims identified in this study to take the place of the aims found earlier for ceu, chb, jpt, and yri populations. some of the aims identified in this study may be limited by the small to moderate number of samples in the hapmap ii project; therefore, the generality of the identified aims should be further examined by using more independent samples and confirmed by biological verifications such as real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction before the aims applying to practical studies.

although ge markers, which are more variable compared to snps, may change by population-specific food preferences or environmental exposures, previous studies did disclose the evidences of the genetic basis of global ge  <cit> . moreover, this study analyzed the ge data from the total rna samples extracted from epstein barr virus -transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines of study individuals  <cit> . the ge variation of lymphoblastoid cell lines, which are important materials for dissecting genetic basis of ge variation of human populations  <cit> , reflects a substantially higher proportion of genetic effect compared to the effect of food preferences or environmental exposures  <cit> . the finding of genetics of global ge can also be supported by previous studies. an important genomic study of global ge variation validated the genetic contribution of the discrepancy of ge between asian and caucasian samples, not an artifact due to life styles. this study showed that  <dig> han chinese residing in los angeles had much more similar ge profiles to the  <dig> hapmap chb + jpt samples than to the  <dig> hapmap ceu samples  <cit> . the other important genomic study of ge also uncovered the genetic contribution on global patterns of ge after adjusting potential confounding factors that may influence ge. this study analyzed ge data of  <dig> individuals from four hapmap ii populations and found ge variation differentiated in population comparisons in agreement with earlier studies  <cit> .

the ge variation may also be influenced by the type of biological specimen, attributes related to the time and other circumstances of taking the biological samples, or ge microarray platform. this study provides a proof-of-concept method for construction of aim panels by integrating snp and ge markers but the current results are still limited by the use of single cell type , fixed time/circumstances of taking the biological samples, and single microarray platform . more investigations should be carried out to understand the proportions of the identified aims specific to the currently used conditions or transferable to more general conditions. for practical applications, we also plan to integrate snp and ge variation from global genomic studies and construct larger reference database for normalizing ge data. snp and ge markers will be integrated to identify aims and establish robust discriminant models using biasless software. biological specimen from a tested individual are collected and used to genotype/measure the identified and confirmed aims. finally, snp genotypes and ge levels of the tested individual are plugged into the discriminant models to determine the correct ethnic group.

regarding the supervised classification method, two points are important to discuss. first, we modified the efficient and broadly used fda algorithm and integrated forward variable selection and cross-validation procedures with fda to select key predictive markers from enormous numbers of snp and ge markers, and we then built accurate classification models for sample subdivision. our supervised classification procedure provides multiple candidate models . choosing a model with the highest testing accuracy is recommended but should not be the only criterion for model selection. other optimal criteria and domain knowledge may need to be considered to determine the best model that satisfying both statistical properties and biological relevance. for example, the cross-validation consistency of a model among all candidate models may be used simultaneously, or genetic knowledge, biological relevance, and quality evaluation of genetic markers may also be integrated to assist in selection of the final classification model. second, there is a very rich body of literature in the field of supervised classification, including support vector mechanisms  <cit>  and classification trees  <cit> . different algorithms have pros and cons in different study scenarios and data types. we are adding various classification algorithms to further enrich the biasless software.

this study analyzed the data in the hapmap ii project, which contains only four populations, rather than the hapmap iii project, which contains  <dig> populations because ge data for the majority of samples in the hapmap iii project are not available. however, the proposed method and software can be applied in general to construct aim panels for additional populations. the snp data in this study came from two genotyping platforms: affymetrix 500 k and array <dig>  snp chips. the results of the sample classification were similar, although the number of snps interrogated on affymetrix 500 k  was only about half the number in array  <dig>  , suggesting that the ancestral information in snps identified with affymetrix array <dig>  is not more informative than that in snps identified with affymetrix 500 k, with regard to the classification of samples in the hapmap ii project. recently, whole-genome sequencing technology, in comparison with snp microarrays, has become more common and has promoted the identification of new common snps and rare variants. novel population-specific or ancestry-informative variants may be identified, and more eqtls that contribute to genetic variation of ancestry informative ge may become available. it will be interesting to investigate if the bottleneck in a snp-only analysis for discerning samples from closely related populations can be overcome using highly dense common snps and rare variants from massive parallel sequencing in the  <dig> genomes project  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we recommend snp-only analysis for sample subdivision when the study samples come from ethnically distant populations such as asian , african , and caucasian ; ancestry informative or population-specific snps provide sufficient information for sample classification in this situation, but population-specific snps may not be available or may be very hard to identify in ethnically close populations such as chinese  and japanese . quantitative ge data, which are more variable than qualitative snp data, are useful for sample classification after properly removing noisy ge markers. note, however, that the ge-only analysis is still limited by slightly fluctuating testing accuracies and a larger number of predictive markers even when the samples are from ethnically distant populations. however, ge data do reveal important classification information supplemental to snp data. using an integration of snp and ge markers, we established classification models with a reduced number of markers to accurately assign samples to the correct ethnic populations. importantly, the genotyping cost is reduced because the number of required markers in an aim panel is significantly diminished after inclusion of ancestry informative ge markers.
