BACKGROUND
during field work, biologists usually use morphological characters for species identification as a first approach, especially as vision is our prevailing mode of sensory perception. investigating animals like birds, insects or anurans, experts often additionally rely on acoustics  <cit> , but such expertise is sometimes lacking and species identification can remain uncertain. however, correct species identification is of high importance for both basic and applied research in the field including agricultural science of pest species  <cit> , medical treatment  <cit> , ecological studies  <cit> , and conservation efforts  <cit> . a particular problem for correct species delimitation and identification are so-called cryptic taxa  <cit> , herein referring to superficially  indistinguishable lineages. understudied cryptic species complexes may lead to inaccurate scientific results in studies of community ecology  <cit> , population assessments in economically exploited species  <cit> , or conservation decisions aimed at retaining phylogenetic diversity  <cit> .

improved methodologies, such as molecular and acoustic techniques, make biologists increasingly aware of cryptic species and related problems . cryptic taxa are not restricted to taxonomic groups or biogeographic regions  <cit> . these may comprise inconspicuous taxa in pathogenic fungi  <cit> , bryophytes  <cit> , insects  <cit> , small mammals  <cit> , birds  <cit> , or reptiles  <cit> , but may also include charismatic organisms such as hammerhead sharks  <cit> , lemurs  <cit> , giraffes  <cit> , and elephants  <cit> .

quite often complexes of cryptic species include lineages with wide distributions. molecular analyses provide a reliable and quick approach to search for geographically circumscribed lineages and may facilitate discerning minor but diagnostic morphological differences between these lineages  <cit> .

anuran amphibians have been recognised as a group with various examples of cryptic species  <cit> . many frog species are superficially similar in morphology and possible minor differences can be difficult to observe in the field  <cit> .

odontobatrachus natator  is the only species of the frog family odontobatrachidae, a recently discovered lineage endemic to upper guinea, west africa  <cit> . these frogs depend on streams with strong currents and cascades or rapids in forested areas. they occur at mid elevations and have a wide but patchy distribution, ranging from western guinea to western côte d'ivoire  <cit> . upper guinean montane forests are already known to contain cryptic species in various taxonomic groups including bats  <cit>  or rodents  <cit> . populations of o. natator are known to vary in colouration and shape of glandular dorsal ridges  <cit> , and barej et al.  <cit>  recovered unexpectedly high genetic variance between populations. following these preliminary molecular findings, we conducted a genetic analysis based on more than  <dig> samples of odontobatrachus natator covering its entire known range to access molecular variation within this family. we also modelled the potential geographic limits of recognised genetic lineages to delimit their potential distributions. additionally, we calculated the iucn red list criteria “extent of occurrence” and “area of occupancy” to categorize the potential threat status for each lineage as a basis for conservation decisions.

RESULTS
phylogenetic relationships and diversity
results of two different phylogenetic methods, maximum likelihood  and bayesian inference , both were congruent in recovering the same five major otus. the tree topology resulting from 3527 bp concatenated mitochondrial and nuclear genes, with respective node support values, is shown in figure 1a . relationships among these otus were not all strongly supported in the ml analysis. the five otus formed two divergent major clades, one consisting of three clades from the central and eastern parts of the distribution range, while the second major clade is distributed exclusively in western localities . a congruent topology has been uncovered in the species tree approach .figure  <dig> trees and uncorrected p-distances of odontobatrachus.  tree resulting from partitioned bayes and ml analyses of mitochondrial genes 16s, 12s, cytb and nuclear genes rag <dig>  sia and bdnf .  species tree from mitochondrial dna data from the bayesian inference of species trees . support values for  and  are provided as bayesian posterior probabilities  and boostrap support values .  mean uncorrected 16s p-distances between the five otus  and maximum p-distances within each otu . subclades in natator refer to the freetown peninsula, sierra leone  and remaining natator population further inland . remark: within p-distances in natator-subclades possess distinctly lower values than the whole otu natator. minimum, maximum, mean values and standard deviation of p-distances between and within otus are provided in tables  <dig> and  <dig> 



the number of candidate species identified by speciesidentifier  depended on the applied threshold values. the number of recognised clusters increased with decreasing threshold values . threshold values differed between analysed mitochondrial genes suggesting different evolutionary rates, with 12s being the slowest and cytb the fastest one. a total of five clusters, corresponding to clades  in the phylogenetic analyses, as well as the subdivision within natator, are recognized.

mean uncorrected p-distances of the 16s rrna between the five otus, ranged between  <dig> - <dig> % . summary of 16s rrna uncorrected p-distances within and between otus are provided in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  remarkably, natator possessed a sub-division of haplotypes dividing the coastal population from the freetown peninsula in sierra leone  and the remaining population further inland . this pattern was reflected in intraspecific p-distances within otus ranging from  <dig> - <dig> % for otu1- <dig> and  <dig> % in natator . intraclade values within each subclade of natator were 0% for fp and  <dig> % for the more widespread il, respectively. a subdivision of natator in two subclades fp and il corresponded to the increase of recognized clusters in speciesidentifier. the gmyc model  identified a robust number of possible otus both in the outgroup and in the ingroup . depending on the priors used to construct the ultrametric tree in beast we found a range from 9– <dig> otus in the complete dataset including the four included outgroups . there was no significant difference between the single- and multiple-threshold approaches; both methods identified either  <dig> or  <dig> clusters and between 2– <dig> singletons. the yule model with the lognormal relaxed clock produced the lowest number of total groups both with the single-  and multiple-threshold  approaches, but this approach also produced the largest confidence limit interval in the single-threshold approach , while all other single approaches produced the same very small confidence interval for the total recovered groups . concentrating on the taxa within odontobatrachus we found that exactly the same otus postulated by the other applied methods were identified in the single-threshold approaches, while the multiple-threshold approaches predicted further splits within those previously identified otus leading to few singletons . dating results based on substitution rates point to very young speciation in plio-pleistocene times for the genus odontobatrachus . however, exact timing of splits should be regarded with caution until more recent calibration points are available, enabling a more accurate dating approximation. the original information for the type locality of odontobatrachus natator  stated just “sierra leone”. however, as only one otu occurred in all known samples from sierra leone the assignment of the name natator  to this particular otu was without doubt. although enms indicated potential distribution of additional otus in sierra leone, their presence is unlikely . sampled localities of otu natator showed the widest distribution in the genus ranging from western guinea through sierra leone to eastern guinea and eastern liberia . otu <dig>  referred to sites in the simandou range and the massif du ziama in south-eastern guinea . otu <dig>  and otu <dig>  covered haplotypes entirely located in western guinea . otu <dig>  was based on haplotypes from the nimba mountains and a few adjacent elevations in south-eastern guinea and northeastern liberia, as well as populations from mont sangbé national park in western côte d'ivoire . phylogenetically, the otus from west  and east  were closely related, while natator was placed closer to eastern otus . however, the natator placement was not strongly supported in this or other concatenated analyses.table  <dig>

haplotype networks
differences in haploid genotypes of otus and their relationships were assessed with unrooted haplotype networks, showing one-step mutations; identical sequences were pooled into a single terminal. numbers of analysed sequences and uncovered haplotypes were as follows : mitochondrial genes 16s , 12s , cytb , nuclear genes rag <dig> , sia  and bdnf . haplotype networks of mitochondrial genes  showed a clear separation of clades and partitioning of haplotypes to a degree of forming distinct and un-associated sub-networks for all five otus . comparable to the results above, natator formed two distinct subclades. these were un-associated in cytb , divided by a minimum of nine mutation steps in the 16s gene  and even in the slowest mitochondrial gene, 12s, fp samples were separated from remaining natator-haplotypes . concerning nuclear markers, solely the rag <dig> gene exhibited a differentiation and privatization of the five otus, even separating fp haplotypes in natator from remaining localities . in contrast, bdnf and sia showed little variation and a large overlap of shared haplotypes of the five otus and within natator .figure  <dig> parsimony networks of haplotypes in odontobatrachidae. networks corresponding to mitochondrial genes 16s , 12s , cytb  and nuclear genes rag <dig>  and sia  and bdnf  sequence variation from analysed samples. the colours correspond to distribution maps  and trees : natator , natator , otu <dig> , otu <dig> , otu <dig>  and otu <dig> . mitochondrial genes  show un-associated sub-networks and two nuclear genes  show almost identical haplotypes. the size of the circles is proportional to the number of alleles for each gene.



diagnostic nuclear sites
four sites in the rag <dig> gene and a single site in sia supported two major groupings and distinguished the western otu <dig> and otu <dig> from more eastern natator, otu <dig> and otu <dig>  additionally, the five otus were defined in nuclear genes by a few deviating sites only.

environmental niche modelling
overall the enms performed well, with training auc values of  <dig> - <dig>  and test auc values of  <dig> - <dig>  in individual otus and otucomb . only in otucomb and natator all parameters contributed to enms . highest contributions in otus were as following: in otucomb highest precipitation value or wettest month  and total annual precipitation  had highest predictive power; in otu natator highest precipitation value  and total annual precipitation ; in otu <dig> total annual precipitation  and lowest precipitation value ; in otu <dig> standard deviation of the precipitation  and percentage of bare ground ; in otu <dig> standard deviation of precipitation  and percentage of bare ground ; in otu <dig> lowest precipitation value , elevational variance calculated from the srtm <dig> data set using a 9x <dig> moving window  and highest precipitation value . consequently, parameters with highest contribution in otu <dig> and otu <dig> were identical , while otus natator, otu <dig> and otu <dig> had one parameter in common respectively .

enms of potential distribution of the family odontobatrachidae  revealed an area smaller than just superposed enms of all separate otus . however, it showed that samples included herein covered the entire distribution of this family. considering enms the border area between sierra leone-guinea-liberia might inhabit up to three otus of odontobatrachid frogs, however records from that area lack so far. enms of natator predominantly covered the border area of these three countries , and south-eastern liberia with some extensions into western côte d'ivoire . moreover, a distinct gap of apparently unsuitable area separated natator localities around freetown, sierra leone from other populations further inland figure 2b). enms of otu <dig> covered parts of south-eastern guinea and westwards into sierra leone . enms of otu <dig> and otu <dig> showed a largely overlapping potential area of distribution in western guinea and sierra leone . enms of otu <dig> covered areas in south-eastern guinea/northern liberia and further westwards reaching eastern sierra leone . generally, enms of otu <dig> and otu <dig> showed very little or no overlap in their potential distribution with otu <dig> and otu <dig>  concerning sampled localities, only natator possessed areas overlapping distribution ranges of eastern otus  in south-eastern guinea and reaching easternmost distribution boundaries of western otus  in western guinea, respectively .

conservation status
both applied species delimitation methods revealed 5– <dig> otus within odontobatrachus. we examined their potential conservation status, at first in a more conservative approach . in a second step we assess the potential conservation status of two lineages within “natator”. following the iucn red list geographic range criterion the calculated eoos classified otu <dig> and otu <dig> as “vulnerable.” otu <dig> and otu <dig> as “endangered” and only natator as of “least concern” . in contrast, aoo calculations depicted ranges classifying all five otus as “endangered.” if both natator subclades are recognised as distinct species, the red list category for the freetown peninsula subclade would change to “critically endangered” due to its low aoo .table  <dig>

discussion
taxonomic decisions in cryptic species complexes are usually based on subtle morphological characters. morphological congruence not only impedes species recognition, due to absence of striking differences, but the whole description process itself as statistically exploitable numbers of vouchers are needed to recognize differences in otherwise overlapping morphometrics. because genetic divergence accompanied by morphological similarity is not uncommon, cryptic speciation either remains overlooked  <cit>  or species diagnoses focus exclusively on molecular markers  <cit> .

our analyses of the west african torrent-frog odontobatrachus natator, presumed to be widely distributed, uncovered a cryptic diversity within this unique evolutionary lineage  <cit> . based on analyses of concatenated mitochondrial and nuclear loci, we recognize five otus in the family odontobatrachidae. both applied species delimitation approaches indicate the presence of five or six candidate species within odontobatrachus, corresponding to otus in the phylogenetic analyses, respectively. the mitochondrial 16s gene is commonly used for barcoding approaches in anuran amphibians  <cit> , and uncorrected p-distances recognized between otus are comparable to species level differences in non-related frog genera and families thus pointing to cryptic speciation in odontobatrachus . recognized p-distances within each otu were considerably lower than  <dig> % .

mitochondrial genes demonstrated utility for determining lineages of geographically separated otus  <cit>  and all five otus have discrete 16s, 12s and cytb haplotypes. of the nuclear genes, solely rag <dig> distinguished all five otus by discrete haplotypes. geographically adjacent otus have been pooled in two of three nuclear genes  supporting a geographical split of the western  against the remaining otus in the upper guinean forests . differences in the level of separation in nuclear genes may be due to incomplete lineage sorting at each single nuclear loci or different evolutionary rates  <cit> .

the unexpected recognition of five distinct otus raised the necessity to assign the officially described taxon odontobatrachus natator  to one of them. despite the fact that enms indicated the potential occurrence of all otus in sierra leone, all sampled localities from sierra leone belonged genetically to a single otu. the type locality of o. natator is sierra leone, consequently the respective otu was assigned to the nominate taxon . generally, otus showed a parapatric distribution in upper guinea and distribution patterns in the family odontobatrachidae are now regarded as follows : o. natator has the widest range and is present in lowlands to mid-altitudes from the southern edge of the fouta djallon in western guinea to eastern liberia and southeastern guinea ; otu <dig> occurs in lowlands to mid-elevations north of the nimba mountains in south-eastern guinea ; otu <dig> occurs in lowlands in western guinea ; otu <dig> likewise occurs in western guinea but at higher elevations ; otu <dig> occurs in lowlands to mid elevations in the border area guinea-liberia-côte d'ivoire and further east . consequently, geographic separation and genetic distinctness of otus at the species-level, identify odontobatrachus natator as a complex of cryptic species.

potential geographic ranges based on enms exceeded the known distribution ranges in four of five otus; the only exception is natator . otu <dig> and otu <dig> could be widely distributed in eastern guinea and the border region of sierra leone-guinea-liberia, while otu <dig> and otu <dig> could occur in central sierra leone and even enter guinea-bissau in the case of otu <dig> . however, we believe that these predictions are unlikely. given our own dense sampling of the entire upper guinea forest zone, it is reasonable to assume that the observed ranges are close to the known ranges of all five otus. field observations coarsely explain the occurrence of odontobatrachus by two factors: 1) forest cover and 2) slopes  with fast-flowing streams of various sizes, including waterfalls and cascades. as various areas in the upper guinean forests are apparently suitable to several otus and geographic barriers, such as large rivers or mountain chains do not exist in this area , competitive exclusion due to niche occupation by natator may shape the distributions of otu1- <dig>  <cit> .

otus more closely related to each other are likewise spatially closer: a western clade is present in the fouta djallon highlands and its western extensions , and the central-eastern clade occurs in the guinea highlands, running from southern fouta djallon through northern sierra leone and liberia to western côte d'ivoire . a potential scenario responsible for such a distribution might be the fluctuations in african palaeo-environments and repeated expansion and contraction of suitable forested habitat for species such as those of the family odontobatrachidae  <cit> . the refuge theory aims at explaining how such forest refugia, especially montane forests, have boosted speciation in forest dependent species during past arid epochs  <cit> . the role of upper guinean forests as refugia is uncontroversial  <cit> . but, knowledge concerning the exact historical process  of west african refugia remains scarce  <cit> . in particular the existence and geographic position of so-called micro-refugia, small forest areas outside postulated larger refugia, is unclear. however, these may be particularly important for the persistence of a large portion of regional biodiversity  <cit> .

close relationships between odontobatrachus otus cause a lack of resolution in slow-evolving nuclear genes . despite a clear resolution, likewise the comparatively low number of changes in fast evolving mitochondrial genes 12s and 16s points to rather recent splits, and the following speciation scenario seems most likely. while calculations of node ages should be regarded with caution until more recent calibration points are available, calculated node ages younger than 3 ma support very young speciation events in the genus odontobatrachus . torrent frogs may have evolved in the central guinea highlands , and then colonised westwards to the fouta djallon  and eastwards to the simandou range-nimba mountains , always settling along fast running streams in forests . for the plio-pleistocene several aridity-dominated periods are known  <cit>  and while open habitats dominated the landscape in upper guinea, torrent frogs have probably only prevailed in isolated montane forests as it is also assumed for other forest-dependant groups  <cit> . the fouta djallon as well as the simandou range-nimba mountains are known to comprise many endemic species  <cit>  and both are assumed to play a role as upper guinean forest refugia  <cit> . a subsequent turn of forest expansion and contraction might have resulted in sister relationship of otus in eastern and western upper guinea . the loma mountains-tingi hills area  in sierra leone might have served as the refuge for natator in central guinea highlands . the latest expansions of forests and increase of suitable habitats was apparently exploited best by natator as this otu shows the widest distribution. probably a population of natator was likewise pushed back to coastal elevations of the peninsula mountains  during relatively cold climates, resulting in molecular divergence. today, both natator subclades are separated by unsuitable habitat due to lack of forest cover that might result from environmental changes in more recent times  <cit>  and not least from anthropogenic deforestation, e.g. during colonization events  <cit>  and before.

differing dispersal patterns of odontobatrachus otus, showing differences in size of distribution areas, could result from minor differences in: habitat requirements, ecological adaptations or persistence in more widespread micro-refugia. such ecological data should be searched for in future studies of this genus. however, enms revealed that closer related otus  share important factors shaping their potential distribution which play a minor role for the sister clade . generally, precipitation played an important role in shaping distribution of all otus although important precipitation parameters differed between otus .

in conclusion, the assumed monospecific west african frog family odontobatrachidae obviously contains several undescribed species. distribution patterns provide first insights into the subdivisions of the upper guinean forest refugium, but knowledge on the ecological requirements leading to the present distribution patterns of these frogs is incomplete and requires further investigation to support our hypotheses.

conservation concern
amphibian declines occur around the world and in all major habitat types, with forest species showing highest losses  <cit> . west africa represents a distinct biodiversity hotspot  <cit> . its major threats are rapid deforestation, often including degradation and fragmentation, and the increase of agricultural encroachment and mining in upper guinean mountains  <cit> . taxa with narrow habitat niches are highly threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation effects  <cit> , and because of their dependence on fast flowing streams in forested areas this applies to the west african torrent frogs. at present, odontobatrachus natator has been assigned the iucn red list category “near threatened“  <cit> , with a trend of decreasing populations. however, our results indicate that the different otus represent distinct species, and thus should then be classified as “endangered.” if the two subclades of natator are recognized as distinct species, the freetown peninsula population would require the red list category “critically endangered”. today’s conservation efforts should concern distinct genetic lineages within species  <cit>  and consequently should be applied to o. natator s.l. as well.

although guinea exhibits the highest diversity of the family odontobatrachidae, with all five otus, the network of protected areas is poor  <cit> . considering the distribution of this family, only three otus occur in protected areas . however, even in protected areas threats to herein defined otus are evident: natator , otu <dig> , otu <dig> . while both natator-subclades occur in protected areas, otu <dig> and otu <dig>  are entirely unprotected at present.

almost everywhere throughout its distribution range odontobatrachus natator s.l. occurs sympatrically with conraua alleni, the latter inhabiting more slowly-running parts of streams. while c. alleni is already listed as “vulnerable”  <cit>  this classification is probably insufficient as high genetic diversity indicates another cryptic complex . consequently, any conservation effort concerning odontobatrachus could also maintain lineages of the c. alleni complex, as well as other forest and stream dependent taxa of other taxonomic groups, not yet in focus of any more in detail research activities.

CONCLUSIONS
a large-scale molecular assessment of the west african endemic family odontobatrachidae throughout its distribution range revealed the presence of distinct operational taxonomic units . bayesian methods and ml uncovered five otus, which show a parapatric distribution and slight differences in parameters contributing to respective environmental niche models. otus most likely represent distinct species and challenge the monospecific status of odontobatrachidae. the assigned nominate form odontobatrachus natator revealed two subclades in both analyses, which are geographically separated by unsuitable habitat. following iucn red list criteria all five otus should be classified as ‘endangered’ if later recognized as distinct species. only two otus currently occur in protected areas, while all are endangered through habitat loss. knowledge of forest refugia within the upper guinean forests is scarce but the distribution pattern of odontobatrachidae otus suggest likely refugia within the fouta djallon, simandou range-nimba mountains, loma mountains-tingi hills and the peninsula mountains.
