BACKGROUND
low temperature is one of the major limiting factors for the distribution, growth, and development of many plant species  <cit> . breeding for increased cold hardiness in plants is an effective method to reduce the loss caused by cold stress. however, the lack of knowledge on the molecular mechanism of cold response in most plant species limits breeding progress. therefore, elucidating the molecular mechanisms of plant responses to cold stress will accelerate the pace of genetic improvement of freezing tolerance.

when exposed to non-freezing temperatures for a certain period of time, plants show increased freezing tolerance by an adaptive phenomenon known as cold acclimation, which involves a number of biochemical and physiological changes  <cit> . these intracellular changes are associated with alteration in gene expression. currently, the well known cold signaling pathway is the ice1-cbf-cor transcriptional cascade. in this pathway, c-repeat -binding factors  are rapidly induced by cold, and recognize the promoter regions of cor genes to activate their transcription  <cit> . the expression of cbf is activated by ice <dig> , which encodes a myc-type bhlh transcription factor  <cit> . transcriptome analysis also showed that only  <dig> % of the cold responsive genes are controlled by cbfs  <cit> , suggesting that there were cbf-independent components involved in cold signaling. for example, loss function of hos <dig> gene encoding a homeobox transcription factor causes reduced freezing tolerance without changing the expression of cbfs and their target genes  <cit> . although much progress has been made toward elucidating the molecular mechanisms of plant responses to cold stress, how plants sense low temperature signals remain unanswered. the recent findings support the hypothesis that plant cells can perceive cold stress and subsequently trigger the production of second messengers, such as ca2+ via membrane rigidification  <cit> .

in recent years, the rna-seq has become a key technology for investigating transcriptome profiling among different species by de novo assembly or mapping. besides, rna-seq is an efficient means to generate functional genomic data for non-model organisms or those with genome characteristics extremely difficult to whole-genome sequencing  <cit> . for instance, rna-seq has been successfully applied to characterize the transcriptomic response to low temperature in chrysanthemum , lily  and tea  .

bermudagrass  is one of the most widely used warm-season turfgrass species for parks, lawns, and sport fields especially in golf courses  <cit> . bermudagrass displays high tolerance to salt, drought and heat stresses, but is sensitive to cold stress  <cit> . cold stress is a key factor limiting widespread use of bermudagrass. thus, it is important to improve cold tolerance for bermudagrass. although previous studies have identified several physiological and metabolic changes in bermudagrass after cold treatment, including the expression of genes encoding chitinase, dehydrin and antioxidant enzyme, protein synthesis, amino acid metabolism , the physiological and molecular mechanism of cold stress response in bermudagrass is largely unknown.

to date, few studies have been carried out to the transcriptional studies in bermudagrass. the transcriptomic responses of bermudagrass to low temperature using rna-seq have not been reported so far. in this study, the rna-seq platform based on illumina ngs technology was used to investigate the transcriptomic response to low temperature by comparing the different transcriptome between two cold contrasting bermudagrass genotypes  subjected to periods of sub-zero temperature with or without a prior ca. thus, the objectives of the present study were to  identify genes involved in response to chilling/freezing;  elucidate the molecular mechanisms of cold tolerance through transcriptomic analysis of the two genotypes differing in tolerance to cold stress;  gain a deep insight into the molecular basis of ca process in enhancing plant freezing tolerance.

methods
plant materials and growth conditions
the  <dig> bermudagrass accessions were planted in the plastic pots  filled with matrix . each accession was repeated  <dig> times. the plants were treated with 4 °c for  <dig> d, and the plants cultivated under 30/25 °c  were set as the control. transpiration rate and growth rate of the plants were determined every week. the membership function method of fuzzy mathematics was analyzed using the phenotypic traits after a  <dig> d chilling treatment. the membership values of each accession were the index of cold tolerance. after the first round screening,  <dig> relatively cold-tolerant and  <dig> cold-sensitive accessions were obtained, respectively. to further screen the relatively most cold-tolerant and cold-sensitive genotypes, the  <dig> accessions were treated with −5 °c for 4 h with or without cold acclimation. finally, the most promising cold-tolerant  and -sensitive bermudagrass genotypes were selected and further confirmed, respectively .

the cold-tolerant  and -sensitive bermudagrass plants were grown in plastic pots with a mix of sand and peat soil  in the greenhouse with natural sunlight, relative humidity of  <dig> %, and temperatures of 30/20 °c . the plants in pots are ramets of the same clone, and the genetic background for these plants is uniform. after two months of establishment, plants were transferred to controlled-environment growth chambers , with a 14-h photoperiod, photosynthetically active radiation at 450 μmol m−2 s− <dig> in the canopy level with a day/night temperature of 30/20 °c and  <dig> % humidity. plants were fertilized three times a week with half-strength hoagland’s solution until dripping throughout the experiment in order to keep them close to field capacity.

treatments and experimental design
when allowed to acclimate for 3 days at normal condition, plants were exposed to various cold treatments. the cold-tolerant and -sensitive genotypes were divided into two groups . plants in group i were placed in a freezing chamber set to 4 °c for 48 h before being transferred to −5 °c for 4 h, whereas plants in group ii without ca were directly incubated at −5 °c for 4 h. the leaf samples for transcriptome sequencing were collected at 0 h , 24 h  and 48 h  after 4 °c treatment, −5 °c for 4 h after prior ca , and −5 °c for 4 h without prior ca , respectively. at each sampling time point, the leaves from three pots  of each genotype were pooled together as one biological replicate and frozen immediately with liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °c in preparation for rna-seq analysis. there were ten samples in total used for illumina genome analyzer deep sequencing.

rna preparation
total rna was isolated from the leaves using trizol reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol . then, rna degradation and contamination was monitored on  <dig> % agarose gels. rna purity was checked using the nano photometer spectrophotometer . the rna concentration was measured using qubit rna assay kit in qubit  <dig>  flurometer . rna integrity was evaluated using the rna nano  <dig> assay kit of the bioanalyzer  <dig> system .

transcriptome sample preparation and sequencing
the total amount of 3 μg rna per sample confirmed for rin values above  <dig>  was used as input material in constructing the sequencing library. the library was generated using illumina truseq rna sample preparation kit  according to manufacturer’s recommendations, and ten index codes were added to the sample for subsequent documentation. briefly, mrna was purified from total rna using poly-t oligo-attached magnetic beads. fragmentation was carried out using divalent cations under elevated temperature in illumina proprietary fragmentation buffer. first-strand cdna was synthesized using random oligonucleotides and superscript ii. second-strand cdna synthesis was subsequently performed using dna polymerase i and rnase h. remaining overhangs were converted into blunt ends via exonuclease/polymerase activities and enzymes were removed. after adenylation of 3’ ends of dna fragments, illumina pe adapter oligonucleotides were ligated to prepare for hybridization. to select cdna fragments of preferentially 200 bp in length, the library fragments were purified with ampure xp system . dna fragments with ligated adaptor molecules on both ends were selectively enriched using illumina pcr primer cocktail in a 10 cycle pcr. products were purified  and quantified using the agilent high-sensitivity dna assay on the agilent bioanalyzer  <dig> system. the clustering of the index-coded sample was performed on a cbot cluster generation system using truseq pe cluster kit v3-cbot-hs  according to the vender’s instructions. after cluster generation, the library preparation was sequenced on an illumina hiseq  <dig> platform and 100 bp single-end reads were generated.

bioinformatic analysis
quality control
the raw reads were processed by removing reads containing adapter, reads containing ploy-n and low quality reads, and then the clean data  were obtained. at the same time, q <dig>  q <dig>  gc-content and sequence duplication level of the clean data were calculated. all the downstream analyses were based on clean data with high quality.

transcriptome assembly
the left files  from all libraries/samples were pooled into one big left.fq file, and right files  into one big right.fq file. transcriptome assembly was accomplished based on the left.fq and right.fq using trinity  <cit>  with min_kmer_cov set to  <dig> by default and all other parameters set default.

gene functional annotation
gene function was annotated using the nucleotide  and protein  database, and assigned to functional categories in the kog/cog, go and kegg database by searching blastx with an e value cutoff of 10− <dig> 

differential expression analysis
prior to differential gene expression analysis, for each sequenced library, the read counts were adjusted by edger program package through one scaling normalized factor. differential expression analysis of two samples was performed using the degseq  r package. p-value was adjusted using q value  <cit> . q value <  <dig>  & |log2| >  <dig> was set as the threshold for significant differential expression.

go enrichment analysis
gene ontology  enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes  was implemented by the goseq r packages based on wallenius non-central hyper-geometric distribution  <cit> , which can be adjusted for gene length bias in degs.

kegg pathway enrichment analysis
kegg  <cit>  is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, such as the cell, the organism and the ecosystem, from molecular-level information, especially large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies . we used kobas  <cit>  software to test the statistical enrichment of differential expression genes in kegg pathways.

validation of rna-seq data by real-time quantitative pcr
to validate the expression of the candidate gene, real-time quantitative rt-pcr was employed by the method described previously by chen et al.   <cit> , and the cdact <dig> gene was used as a quantitative control.table  <dig> summary of sequence assembly after illumina sequencing



RESULTS
transcriptome sequencing and assembly
to comprehensively survey the genes associated with cold stress response in bermudagrass, ten cdna libraries were constructed from total rna extracted from leaves of bermudagrass  with different cold treatments. the libraries were sequenced using the illumina hiseq™  <dig> platform. an overview of the rna-seq reads derived from the ten libraries was presented in table  <dig>  in total,  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> raw reads were generated in the cdr_ <dig>  cdrca_ <dig>  cdrca_ <dig>  cdrca_ <dig>  cdrna_ <dig>  cds_ <dig>  cdsca_ <dig>  cdsca_ <dig>  cdsca_ <dig> and cdsna_ <dig>  respectively . to ensure the reliability of the libraries, we performed quality controls and obtained  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads for cdr_ <dig>  cdrca_ <dig>  cdrca_ <dig>  cdrca_ <dig>  cdrna_ <dig>  cds_ <dig>  cdsca_ <dig>  cdsca_ <dig>  cdsca_ <dig> and cdsna_ <dig>  because of the absence of reference genomic sequences, de novo assembly was employed to construct transcripts from these rna-seq reads. trinity software was used for de novo assembly of the illumina reads, which has been proven to be efficient for de novo reconstruction of transcriptomes from rna-seq data  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  contigs were obtained from the clean reads with a mean length of 1277 bp and length ranging from 201 bp to 20202 bp . among the  <dig>  contigs,  <dig>  unigenes were obtained with an average length of 706 bp. the longest and shortest unigene was  <dig>  bp and 201 bp, respectively .table  <dig> length distribution of the transcripts and unigenes clustered from the de novo assembly

note: the n <dig> size is computed by sorting all transcripts from largest to smallest and by determining the minimum set of transcripts whose sizes total 50 % of the entire transcript and unigene was the same; n <dig> was counted in the similar way

the unigenes were annotated by searching against the seven public databases . the results showed that  <dig>  unigenes  had significant matches in the nr database,  <dig>   in the nt database,  <dig>   in the swiss-prot database,  <dig>   in the go database and  <dig>   in the pfam database. in total, there were  <dig>  unigenes  successfully annotated in at least one of the nr, nt, ko, swiss-prot, go, kog and pfam databases, with  <dig> unigenes  in all seven databases.table  <dig> the numbers and distribution rate of unigenes in the databases of nr, nt, ko, swiss-prot, pfam, kog and keeg



gene ontology  classification
for go analysis, there were  <dig>  unigenes divided into three ontologies . for biological process  category, genes involved in ‘cellular process’ , ‘metabolic process’  and ‘single-organism process’ were highly represented. the cellular component category mainly comprised proteins involved in ‘cell’ , ‘cell part’  and ‘organelle’ . in terms of molecular function  category, the highly represented molecular function was ‘binding’ , ‘catalytic activity’  and ‘transporter activity’ .fig.  <dig> the numbers of degs identified in comparisons between pairs of libraries

the kegg database is supposed to provide a systematic analysis of metabolic pathways and functions of gene products. to further identify the biological pathways that are active in bermudagrass, the  <dig> unigenes annotated by blast analysis against kaas  were classified into five main biochemical pathways: ‘cellular processes’, ‘environmental information processing’, ‘genetic information processing’, ‘metabolism’ and ‘organismal systems’. the most represented pathways were ‘metabolism’  . among the  <dig> unigenes in ‘metabolism’ pathway, ‘carbohydrate metabolism’ , ‘amino acid metabolism’  ‘energy metabolism’  ‘lipid metabolism’  were highly represented . the pathways related to ‘environmental information processing’ with the most representation were ‘signal transduction’ . these annotations provided a valuable resource for investigating the processes, functions, and pathways involved in cold response.fig.  <dig> kog annotation of putative proteins. in total, there were  <dig>  unigenes assigned to kog classification and divided into  <dig> specific categories. the x-axis indicates  <dig> groups of kog. the y-axis indicates the percentage of the number of genes annotation under the group in the total number of genes annotation



differential expression genes  analysis under various cold treatments
degs | >1) were defined as genes that were significantly enriched or depleted in one sample relative to the other sample. from the ten comparisons, including treatment r <dig> , r <dig> , r <dig> , r <dig> , r <dig> , s <dig> , s <dig> , s <dig> , s <dig>  and s <dig> , the results showed that a large number of degs were identified. the number of degs detected was as follows: r <dig>  <dig> , r <dig>  <dig> , r <dig>  <dig> , r <dig>  <dig> , r <dig>  <dig> , s <dig>  <dig> , s <dig>  <dig> , s <dig>  <dig> , s <dig>  <dig>  and s <dig>  <dig>  . further hierarchical clustering method was employed to observe the overall expression pattern of the differentially expressed genes . the blue bands identify low gene expression quantity, and the red represent the high gene expression quantity. the results revealed that more degs were detected in comparison r <dig> than that in s <dig>  suggesting that global gene expressions were initiated more quickly in r genotype than those in s genotype, when they were exposed to cold stress. in addition, more degs were identified in the comparisons r <dig> and s <dig>  which underwent a prior cold acclimation  for 48 h, as compared to the treatments which didn’t undergo ca , respectively . it should be noted that the number of degs in r genotype is larger than that in s genotype, when they were subjected to freezing conditions  with or without ca. however, there were no obvious differences between the comparisons s <dig>  and s <dig>  from the hierarchical clustering analysis . when comparing the r <dig>  and s <dig>  treatments, it was surprisingly found that r <dig> had  <dig> degs , whereas only  <dig> degs  were identified in s <dig> treatment. further analysis using a venn diagram showed that both unique and overlapping sets of differentially expressed genes were detected at each treatment in both r and s genotypes . among these degs,  <dig> were categorized as commonly induced genes in r genotype comparisons, r <dig> , r <dig> , r <dig>  and r <dig> , while  <dig> were identified as overlap in four s genotype comparisons, s <dig> , s <dig> , s <dig>  and s <dig>  .fig.  <dig> functional classification and pathway assignment of unigenes by kegg. the results are summarized in five main categories: a, cellular processes; b, environmental information processing; c, genetic information processing; d, metabolism; e, organismal systems. the y-axis indicates the name of the kegg metabolic pathways. the x-axis indicates the percentage of the number of genes annotation under the pathway in the total number of genes annotation

the data available on the molecular basis of the bermudagrass response to low temperature is very limited. in recent years, the development of novel high-throughput sequencing has provided an opportunity to identify cold-related genes in different species by de novo assembly or mapping, thereby contributing to elaborate the molecular mechanism underlying the response to low temperature . in the present study, ten bermudagrass cdna libraries were constructed and sequenced using the illumina hiseq™  <dig> platform, and a large number of degs were identified. the number of degs detected was as follows: r <dig>  <dig> , r <dig>  <dig> , r <dig>  <dig> , r <dig>  <dig> , r <dig>  <dig> , s <dig>  <dig> , s <dig>  <dig> , s <dig>  <dig> , s <dig>  <dig>  and s <dig>  <dig> . overall, the number of degs in the r genotype was larger than that in the s genotype under various cold treatments. the results from parallel comparisons r <dig> and s <dig> revealed that more degs were detected in comparison r <dig>  than that in s <dig> , suggesting that global gene expressions were more quickly initiated in the r genotype than those in s genotype, when they were exposed to cold stress. from the hierarchical clustering analysis, it was found that the s genotype began to appear in a similar model like cdrca_ <dig> when they were exposed to cold for 48 h , further supporting the hypothesis that the s genotype triggered gene expression more slowly than that of the r genotype under cold stress. besides, there were more degs identified in comparisons r <dig> and s <dig>  which underwent a prior cold acclimation  for 48 h, as compared to the treatments which didn’t undergo ca , respectively.

our results further provide additional evidence supporting that plants could obtain enhanced tolerance to freezing temperature when they undergo ca process, and that the acquired resistance may be attributed to a large alteration of global patterns of gene transcription in ca process. however, there was a big difference between r and s genotypes during the ca process as indicated that r <dig>  has  <dig> degs , but only  <dig> degs  were identified in s <dig>  treatment. these results suggest that the r genotype could more effectively activate gene expression during ca process, and thereby better respond to freezing temperature, as compared to s genotype. it was speculated that the prerequisite for plants to obtain enhanced tolerance to freezing through a cold acclimation process is that the plant needs appropriate cold resistance levels.

low temperature sensing and signaling genes
it has been shown that various abiotic stresses, including cold, can trigger intracellular changes in free ca2+ concentration, thereby generating the so-called ca2+ signature, which can be sensed by ca2+ sensors and then transduced through the interaction with their target protein to regulate the expression of stress-responsive genes . there are ca2+ sensor proteins of three major classes: cdpk, cam  and cbl  <cit> . here, six, one, two and four cmls were identified as significant degs in r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig> comparisons, respectively. among these  <dig> cmls,  <dig> were found to be down-regulated, indicating that some reduced cml genes expression may contribute to enhance plant tolerance to cold stress. not surprisingly, it was revealed that over-expression of arabidopsis cam <dig> impairs cold induction of rd29a, kin <dig> and kin <dig>  <cit> . one cml gene  was down-regulated in r <dig>  r <dig>  and r <dig> comparisons. another cml gene  transcript was decreased in r <dig> and r <dig> comparisons, while it unexpectedly increased in r <dig> comparison. likewise, the expression of comp148637_c <dig> and comp152137_c <dig> cml genes was significantly down-regulated in the r <dig> comparison, but induced in r <dig> comparison. these results suggest that cml family proteins may play different roles in the ca process and freezing response with or without a prior ca. furthermore, no cml genes were identified in s <dig> and s <dig> comparison in the s genotype, implying that cml family proteins may function as important signaling responders in conferring bermudagrass tolerance to freezing temperature.

the arabidopsis and rice genomes harbor  <dig> and  <dig> cdpk-encoding genes, respectively  <cit> . cdpks have been identified as being involved in cold signaling. oscpk7/oscdpk <dig> is activated by cold treatment  <cit>  and overexpression of either oscpk7/oscdpk <dig> or oscpk13/oscdpk <dig> improves cold tolerance in transgenic rice  <cit> . in the present study, there were many cdpks identified as degs in each comparisons. one cdpk gene  transcript is accumulated in comparisons r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig> and s <dig>  suggesting that the gene may be not only involved in ca process in both r and s genotypes, but also exclusively involved in the freezing response through prior ca in the r genotype in bermudagrass.

the cbl proteins are characterized as a group of plant calcium sensors that could exclusively interact with cipk proteins. the cbl-cipk signaling components constitute a specific regulatory network of ca2+ signaling in plant cells . many cbls and cipks have been identified as being involved in plant responses to various abiotic stresses. however, there are few reports on the cbl-cipk involved in cold stress responses to date. previous studies have revealed that atcbl <dig> is involved in cold response  <cit> . cipk <dig> and cipk <dig> were reported to be involved in response to cold stress  <cit> . here, two cbl genes were identified as degs. one cbl gene  was induced in the following comparisons, r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig> and s <dig>  another cbl gene  was induced in r <dig> comparisons, suggesting that the gene may be involved in plant response to chilling stress without a prior ca. there are  <dig> and  <dig> degs encoding cipk found in comparisons of cold-resistant and -sensitive genotypes of bermudagrass, respectively. these differentially cold-regulated cbl-cipk components may be useful for breeding cold-resistant bermudagrass in the future.

major classes of tf involved in the response to low temperature
it has been well established that transcription factors  play important roles in response to different abiotic and biotic stresses. here, members of various low temperature-responsive transcription factor  families were identified as dtgs in the treatments involved in a process of low temperature acclimation or freezing with or without ca process.

nac  is a plant specific transcription factor family with diverse roles in plant development and in response to abiotic stresses . hu et al.  reported that over-expression of a stress-responsive nac gene, snac <dig>  increases rice tolerance to cold and salt  <cit> . similarly, overexpression of tanac <dig> resulted in enhanced tolerances to salt, drought and freezing stresses in arabidopsis  <cit> . more recently, banana manac <dig> was proven to be a direct target of maice <dig> and involved in cold stress through interacting with macbf <dig>  <cit> . here, comp148886_c <dig> and comp150085_c <dig> were found to be induced by cold at higher folds in the r genotype than that in the s genotype, suggesting that the two genes may play an important function in conferring r genotype with enhanced cold tolerance, and should be the focus of future studies in bermudagrass.

wrky tfs are a large family of regulators involved in various developmental and physiological processes, especially in response to diverse biotic and abiotic stresses. recently, the results from high-throughput transcriptomic analyses have identified that  <dig> of the populus wrky genes were induced by various biotic and abiotic treatments, including cold  <cit> . transgenic rice over-expressing oswrky <dig> led to drastically increased susceptibility to m. oryzae, but enhanced tolerance to cold stress  <cit> . in the present study, two wrky genes, comp160681_c <dig> and comp160771_c <dig>  were induced in the r <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig> and s <dig> comparisons, suggesting that these two wrky proteins play essential roles in the ca process in both r and s genotypes, but specifically involved in the response to the freezing treatment in plants with prior exposure to ca in the r genotype, suggesting its key roles in conferring bermudagrass enhanced freezing tolerance in the r genotype after ca, compared to the s genotype. moreover, one wrky gene  was examined to be significantly up-regulated in the r <dig> comparison, but not induced in the s <dig> comparison, indicating that its distinctive function was involved in the r genotype response to chilling without the ca process. these results provide new information that the identified wrky genes from cold-resistant bermudagrass may serve as a target gene for breeding new varieties in future.

to date, plant bhlh tfs have been demonstrated to function as transcription regulators involved in a diversity of biological processes, including flowering  <cit> , trichome development  <cit> , root hair formation and development  <cit> , nodule vascular patterning  <cit>  and the photo-induced signal transduction  <cit> . furthermore, bhlh tfs are involved in the plant response to various abiotic stresses, including drought  <cit> , cold  <cit>  and iron deficiency  <cit> . however, although only a few bhlhs have been identified to be involved in cold tolerance mainly in model plant, cold responsive bhlhs needs further identification, and the underlying mechanisms need further elucidation. in recent years, using rna-seq and digital gene expression  technologies, low temperature induced bhlh genes have been identified in grape   <cit> , chrysanthemum   <cit>  and tea   <cit> . here, we also identified cold induced bhlhs in bermudagrass. these genes may play important roles in the enhanced cold hardiness of bermudagrass and should be the focus of future studies in bermudagrass. cbf tfs have been best proven to play primary roles in response to cold stress. six cbfs have been identified in arabidopsis, and three of them, namely, cbf1/dreb1b, cbf2/dreb1c, and cbf3/dreb1a, have been proved to play a primary role in cold acclimation . in our present study, cbfs specifically and highly expressed in r genotype were identified, and the results contributed to the understanding of the mechanism of bermudagrass response to cold.

enriched kegg pathway participated in response to low temperature
photosynthesis is regarded as a highly integrated and regulated process which is highly sensitive to environmental changes, because it needs to balance between the light energy absorbed by the photosystems and the energy consumed by metabolic sinks of the plant  <cit> . it is clear that optimum plant growth and development require a balance in the rates of source versus sink processes. however, cold stress can lead to an imbalance between the source of energy and the metabolic sink, thus requiring photosynthesis adjustments to maintain the balance of energy flow  <cit> . previous studies have also reported that low-temperature modulation of the photosynthetic apparatus may be an important factor during the induction of freezing resistance in cereals  <cit> . as described above, our results revealed that the r genotype may better respond to chilling and freezing, with prior ca, through activating photosynthesis pathway related gene expression, in contrast to the s genotype.

in our present study, it was found that galactose metabolism was identified as enriched pathways in the r <dig> comparison with the rich factor reached  <dig>  %, but just  <dig>  % in the s <dig> comparison, suggesting that galactose metabolism plays essential roles in conferring plant improved tolerance to cold stress. similarly, a targeted metabolite analysis of two rice genotypes, contrasting in chilling tolerance, revealed that chilling-tolerant genotype accumulated more galactose than that of chilling sensitive genotype during chilling stress  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study provided the first large-scale transcriptome dataset in bermudagrass in response to low-temperature stress. a total of  <dig>  contigs were obtained and  <dig>  unigenes were assembled. the differentially expressed genes mainly belonged to low temperature sensing, signaling-related genes, functional proteins and transcription factors, many of which were specifically or predominantly expressed in r genotype under cold treatments. it was also revealed that global gene expressions were initiated more quickly in the r genotype than those in the s genotype, when they were subjected to cold acclimation, and that the r genotype could activate gene expression more effectively to respond to the freezing temperature after ca process than the s genotype. these findings will contribute to understanding the molecular mechanism of bermudagrass response to low temperature.
