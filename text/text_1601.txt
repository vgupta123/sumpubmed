BACKGROUND
the pistacia genus is a member of the anacardiaceae family and consists of at least  <dig> species  <cit> . pistacia vera is the only commercially important species, and is believed to be the most ancestral species, other species are probably its derivatives  <cit> . in the wild, the species grows as a forest tree; some wild species are used as rootstock for p. vera  <cit> . with a few exceptions the sex habit is dioecious, with trees bearing wind-pollinated apetalous flowers  <cit> . iran, usa, turkey, and syria are the main pistachio producers in the world, contributing over 90% of production  <cit> . pistachio has a chromosome count of n =  <dig>  <cit>  and according to flow cytometry analysis a haploid genome size of approximately  <dig> mbp  <cit> .

in recent decades, numerous dna-based molecular marker systems have been developed for marker-assisted selection  in breeding programs. next-generation sequencing  technology provides an effective tool for mas through generating huge number of dna markers within a short period. therefore, ngs-based marker systems allow highly efficient marker development for mas in plant breeding. one such system is restriction site-associated dna sequencing , which detects polymorphic variants neighboring particular restriction enzyme recognition sites  <cit> . radseq has been used to detect single nucleotide polymorphism  in a variety of plant species, with or without an available reference genome  <cit> . radseq was applied in plants for marker development linked to anthracnose and stem blight diseases in lupin   <cit> , and for snp discovery and genetic mapping in lolium perenne l.  <cit> , eggplant   <cit> , grape   <cit> , globe artichoke   <cit> , rapeseed   <cit> , and sunflower   <cit> . radseq has also been used in aquaculture to find sex markers in hippoglossus hippoglossus  <cit>  and lepeophtheirus salmonis  <cit> .

approximately six percent of angiosperm species are dioecious  <cit> . dioecy may have evolved from hermaphrodite or monoecious ancestors by two independent mutations: a first mutation causes male sterility, whereas a second mutation results in decreased female fertility, leading to functional dioecy  <cit> . sex determination mechanisms in plants are diverse, and may involve sex chromosomes, such as in silene  <cit> , carica  <cit> , and actinidia  <cit>  or individual sex gene, e.g., mercurialis  <cit>  and cucumis  <cit> . in pistacia, the genetic mechanism of sex determination remains unknown.

sex chromosomes only evolve in dioecious species when two sex-determining genes are closely linked on the same chromosome with complementary dominance  <cit> . an essential event in sex chromosome evolution is the suppression of recombination between the two sex determination genes. the first step in sex chromosome evolution is the entity of male and female sterile mutations, leading to the development of unisexual reproductive structures  <cit> . flower primordia in the buds of female and male pistachios are similarly initiated in trees of both sexes, with differences between the two sexes becoming apparent early in development; in both cases, the development of organs of opposite sex becomes arrested at the primordial stage  <cit> .

as pistacia has a long juvenility period, sometimes greater than 10 years, mas may greatly facilitate pistachio cultivar-breeding programs. early diagnosis of seedling sex would greatly assist cultivar-breeding programs, nursery management, and germplasm collection.

a randomly amplified polymorphic dna  marker was reported to distinguish male and female p. vera seedlings  <cit> . bulk segregant analysis screening identified a single sex marker . however, this rapd marker was ineffective for sex determination in other pistacia species  <cit> . yakubov et al.  <cit>  converted the rapd marker into a sequenced characterized amplified region  marker; however, amplification of the scar marker was observed in both sexes. the authors sequenced the bands amplified in the male and female, revealing 909-bp and 905-bp length fragments, respectively. these presented high homology , and contained several point mutations. the authors designed new scar primers based on the polymorphic locus, these amplified a 297-bp dna fragment in both sexes. the scar primers were tested in six female and six male p. vera individuals. the authors indicated that a combination of touchdown pcr program and scar primers enabled the development of a female-specific marker in p. vera. recently, esfandiyari et al.  <cit>  tested the scar primer pair in four p. atlantica desf. and four p. khinjuk stock individuals; they reported that the scar marker designed by yakubov et al.  <cit>  could effectively distinguish sex in wild species. however, testing of the rapd and scar primers in a p. vera  f <dig> segregating population, and in a large germplasm collection in our laboratory, revealed false negatives in some female individuals and false positives in some male individuals, including the bağyolu male parent. our analysis also demonstrated that the scar marker could not distinguish sex in wild pistacia species. therefore, a new strategy is necessary to find sex-linked markers and to elucidate the sex determination mechanism in pistachio.

this study aimed to identify snp loci linked to sex in pistachio through ngs-based radseq, using mature female and male individuals in a siirt × bağyolu f <dig> segregating population. sex-linked snp markers were validated both in segregating populations and in a large pistachio germplasm by snapshot analysis. their application was then tested by high-resolution melting  analysis for cost-effective marker-assisted selection in cultivar-breeding programs. inheritance of the markers suggested a sex determination system for dioecious pistachio. there is currently a lack of adequate information on the pistachio genome in the literature. this study is the first to report use of ngs, snapshot and hrm for snp discovery and application in pistachio.

RESULTS
snp discovery in pistachio by radseq
restriction site-associated dna sequencing  of  <dig> male individuals and  <dig> female individuals in a pistacia vera l. siirt × bağyolu f <dig> population  was performed in two lanes of a hi-seq  <dig> sequencing platform. in all,  <dig> , <dig> reads, comprising approximately  <dig> , <dig>  nucleotide sequences were obtained following cleaning of multiplex identifier  sequences.  <dig>  gb of data was obtained from female plants and  <dig>  gb from male plants. the average data comprised  <dig>  gb per plant, with variation between plants from  <dig>  to  <dig>  gb . average coverage depth per read tag among individuals varied from  <dig> × to  <dig> × with an average of  <dig> ×. considering that the genome size of pistachio is ~ <dig> mbp, sequencing coverage of the  <dig> individuals varied from  <dig> × to  <dig> ×, with an average of  <dig> ×. the total number of rad tags for each individual plant varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  with an average of  <dig> .table  <dig>

the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms  for each individual varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig> . the average rate of heterozygote snps was  <dig> %. on average, there was one snp for each 449 bp in pistachio. snps were detected more frequently in female individuals  than in male individuals . similarly, snps were observed more frequently in the female parent cv siirt  than in the male parent cv bağyolu .

identifying snp markers linked to sex in pistachio
following removal of monomorphic rad reads between the two parental plants of the siirt and bağyolu cultivars,  <dig>  polymorphic snp markers were detected across  <dig> individuals. these markers were subjected to sex marker identification, and  <dig> putative sex-associated snp loci were determined in  <dig> rad reads. among these, suitable primer designs were possible for  <dig> snp loci from  <dig> rad reads . the others did not have enough sequence for primer design in one of two ends of a 82 bp illumina read. two reads  had two adjacent snp loci; therefore  <dig> reads were used for the primer design.table  <dig>

the snapshot is a minisequencing and primer extension–based method developed for the analysis of snps. therefore, it was used for validation of sex-associated snp markers in this study. snapshot analysis was initially performed in 42 f <dig> mature progenies with known sex. in the next step, if a snapshot primer set could perfectly distinguish sex in pistachio, the primer set was further tested in  <dig> male and  <dig> female cultivars or genotypes of diverse origin in the germplasm collection, as well as in  <dig> open-pollinated mature progenies derived from siirt and ohadi cultivars . if the snp locus distinguished sex correctly in all  <dig> individuals, then it was considered a valid sex-linked locus in pistachio. next, forward and reverse snp flanking primers were used for high resolution melting  analysis by real-time pcr. since hrm analysis is a rapid and a cost-effective assay for marker-assisted selection  in the breeding programs. sequences of the snp flanking primers and single-base extension primers used are given in table  <dig> table  <dig>

according to the snapshot analysis of  <dig> loci, eight snp loci could successfully separate sex in pistachio. there were two adjacent loci in two reads  within the  <dig> candidate loci. both snp loci in snp-pis- <dig> separated sexes, whereas one of the snp loci in snp-pis- <dig> was ineffective in sex determination . five of the loci were unable to distinguish f <dig> individuals and were discarded; further analysis continued using the remaining eight snp loci from seven reads. therefore, seven pairs of snp flanking primers were used in the hrm analysis. since, hrm analysis is another snp genotyping method for rapid and cost-effective analysis of genetic variation within pcr amplicons. the snapshot analysis results for the eight tested sex-linked loci revealed that all female individuals were heterozygous and all male individuals were homozygous .table  <dig>

hrm analysis was performed in the same plants used for snapshot analysis. among the seven tested snp loci, four  could distinguish sex in all  <dig> tested plants . the remaining three snp loci were unable to distinguish sex by hrm analysis. therefore, four loci were identified as being suitable for marker-assisted selection  in breeding programs. again, all female individuals were heterozygous and all male individuals were homozygous in the hrm analysis results of the four sex-linked loci.figure  <dig>

testing sex-linked snp markers in wild pistacia species
to test the eight snp loci by snapshot analysis in four wild pistacia species,  <dig> female and  <dig> male individuals were assessed from p. atlantica , p. terebinthus l., p. eurycarpa yalt., and p. integerrima stewart, respectively. snapshot analysis revealed that none of the sex-linked markers in p. vera could separate sex in the tested wild pistacia species.

discussion
radseq in pistachio
from  <dig> pistachio plants,  <dig>  gb of data was generated by restriction site-associated dna sequencing  on the hi-seq  <dig> next-generation sequencing  platform, and the average data per pistachio plant was  <dig>  gb. yang et al.  <cit>  previously used the same methodology and sequencing platform to identify markers linked to anthracnose and stem blight in lupin. the authors generated  <dig>  gb data from  <dig> plants, with an average of  <dig>  gb data per plant. therefore, this study made use of more than double the quantity of data generated for marker discovery than was used for lupin.

the number of rad tags in this study was  <dig>  million, with an average of  <dig>  per plant, whereas yang et al.  <cit>  generated  <dig>  million rad tags at an average of  <dig>  per plant. average coverage of the rad tags was  <dig> ×, demonstrating the reliability of the generated data in this study. according to flow cytometry analysis, the haploid genome size of pistachio is ~ <dig> mbp.  <cit> . therefore, it is easy to calculate the sequence coverage of each plant used in this study, with an average of  <dig> × coverage per plant obtained. the high-sequencing coverage depth of plants demonstrates the high reliability of generated snp markers in this study; higher sequencing coverage is required for the discovery of reliable markers in heterozygous populations than in homozygous ones.

identification of sex-linked snp markers in pistachio
this study identified eight snp sex-linked loci for pistachio from seven reads using radseq at three stages:  putative sex-linked snp loci discovery,  validation of sex-linked snp markers in a large germplasm by snapshot analysis, and  cost-effective application of sex-linked snp markers by high-resolution melting  analysis.

in the first stage,  <dig> putative sex-linked snp markers were identified among the  <dig>  polymorphic snp markers produced from  <dig>  gb of data by radseq on the hi-seq  <dig> ngs platform. using the same platform and methodology, yang et al.  <cit>  obtained  <dig>  polymorphic snp markers in lupin for the development of markers linked to anthracnose, and the authors identified  <dig> candidate-linked markers. in the second radseq study by yang et al.  <cit>  to identify markers linked to stem blight in lupin,  <dig>  polymorphic markers were generated, and  <dig> candidate-linked markers found. the number of generated candidate markers was similar in pistachio and lupin for different traits. however, there were  <dig>  times more polymorphic snp loci in pistachio than in lupin, this is probably owing to the high heterozygosity level of plant materials used for our study; we used an f <dig> population in a dioecious species whereas the lupin studies used a ril population.

in the second stage, validation of putative sex-linked markers was performed by snapshot analysis in three different plant materials:   <dig> segregating mature f <dig> progenies  from a siirt × bağyolu population,   <dig> male and  <dig> female pistachio cultivars or genotypes in the germplasm collection, and   <dig> open-pollinated mature pistachio trees  derived from siirt and ohadi cultivars. among  <dig> putative sex-linked snp loci from  <dig> rad reads,  <dig> allowed for primer design and eight distinguished pistachio sex with complete accuracy when using snapshot analysis.

in the snapshot analysis, one of the eight sex-linked snp loci reads had adjacent snp loci. therefore, only snp flanking primers from seven reads were used for the third stage, in which hrm analysis was performed to demonstrate cost-effective use of sex-linked markers in a pistachio breeding program. among these seven, four snp flanking primer pairs were able to separate the sexes in pistachio, and are considered potential sex-linked markers for mas in pistachio breeding applications.

in an earlier study, performed by hormaza  <cit>  in p. vera, a single female-specific sex marker  was found by screening  <dig>  ramdomly amplified polymorphic dna  primers. yakubov et al.  <cit>  converted the opo <dig> rapd marker into a sequence characterized amplified region  marker in combination with touchdown pcr for reliable screening; however, testing of the scar primer in our laboratory in the segregating population, and in a large germplasm collection, generated false negatives in some female individuals and false positives in some male individuals, including the bağyolu male parent. the reason for the discrepancy between this study and earlier ones may be the testing of markers in a limited number of individuals. for example, hormaza et al.  <cit>  tested the marker in seven male and seven female cultivars. it is therefore necessary to test candidate markers in a large germplasm collection for validation of reliable markers. consequently, new, fully reliable, sex-linked markers were generated in this study for use in pistachio.

heterogametic female sex-linked markers suggest zw/zz sex determination in pistachio
in some plant species, sex determination is based on the presence of either homomorphic, , or heteromorphic sex chromosomes . recombination in sex determination regions in these plants is suppressed  <cit> . the suppressed recombination leads to accumulation of repetitive sequences, inversions, deletions, or translocations in different plant species  <cit> .

identification of  <dig> putative sex-associated snp markers as heterozygous in female individuals and homozygous in male individuals using radseq suggests a zw/zz sex determination system in pistachio. validation of the markers by snapshot analysis, and the female-specific marker identified by hormaza et al.  <cit>  support this hypothesis. cherif et al.  <cit>  found three genetically linked simple sequence repeat  markers that are heterozygous only in male individuals, and suggested an xy chromosomal system with a non-recombining xy-like region in date palm . carmichael et al.  <cit>  used radseq technology to find sex-linked markers in the salmon louse . they identified one snp marker that was heterozygous in female individuals and homozygous in male individuals, and suggested a zw/zz female heterogametic sex determination system. palaiokostas et al.  <cit>  used radseq for mapping and sex determination in h. hippoglossus, and revealed xx/xy sex determination. in this study, we identified eight sex-linked loci that were all female heterogametic, further suggesting a zz/zw sex determination system in pistachio.

a new scenario has been widely accepted for describing the evolution of sex chromosomes . this comprises six consecutive steps, and was developed following extensive genetic and genomic studies on the male-specific region  <cit> . actinidia chinensis is in the second stage, and carica papaya is in the third stage. pistachio may be in stage  <dig> or  <dig>  depending on whether the ww female genotype is viable. the reported female-to-male ratio in the segregated populations is 1: <dig>  and there is no report of super-female genotypes in pistachio, this suggests that the ww genotype is not viable. we therefore propose the evolution of sex chromosomes at stage  <dig>  where suppression of recombination extends to neighboring regions allowing a large number of w-linked genes to degenerate and form a female-specific region on the nascent w chromosome, such as the one observed in c. papaya  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
the six stages of sex chromosome evolution obtained from ming et al.  and adapted to zw system. stage 1: unisexual mutation with complementary dominance. stage 2: recombination is suppressed between the two sex determination loci and ww genotype is viable. stage 3: suppression of recombination extends to neighboring regions and form a small female-specific region of the w chromosome . stage 4: the fsw region expands in size, and the z and w chromosomes become heteromorphic. stage 5: severe dejeneration of the w chromosome causes deletion of nonfunctional dna sequences, and results in reduction of w-chromosome size. stage 6: suppression of recombination spreads to the entire w chromosome, w chromosome is totally lost, and z-to-autosome ratio sex determination system has evolved.



in papaya,  <dig> of the  <dig> markers on linkage group  <dig> co-segregate with the sex locus, indicating severe suppression of recombination at this region  <cit> . similar results were obtained in asparagus  <cit> , humulus  <cit> , silene  <cit> , and spinacia  <cit> . we also had similar results, having eight sex-linked loci from  <dig> reads, indicating that suppression of recombination occurred in pistachio. radseq snp markers are derived from a reduced genome and the sex-linked snp loci indicate the formation of a non-recombining sex-determining region in pistachio. suppression of recombination in specific chromosomal regions is a widespread phenomenon in sexually reproducing organisms, and has been documented in plant species with both primitive and advanced sex chromosomes  <cit> .

testing sex-linked snp markers in wild pistacia species
snapshot analysis of eight snp loci in four wild pistacia species revealed that sex-linked markers in p. vera could not distinguish sex in the four tested species. hormaza  <cit>  also tested a female-specific rapd marker in wild pistacia species and found the marker ineffective for sex determination. however, esfandiyari et al.  <cit>  recently tested the marker in four p. atlantica and four p. khinjuk individuals and reported that the scar marker converted by yakubov et al.  <cit>  effectively distinguishes sex in wild species. it is noteworthy that testing of rapd and scar primers developed by hormaza et al.  <cit>  and yakubov et al.  <cit>  in four wild pistacia species in our study was unable to distinguish sex in wild pistacia species. therefore, validation of markers in a large germplasm is one of the most important aspects of marker development.

it is interesting that none of the sex-linked markers identified in p. vera by hormaza  <cit>  or in this study are unable to separate the sexes in wild species. it will be interesting to identify markers for the wild species and to create a sex determination system for them. mapping of sex-linked snp markers in an intra- and inter-specific f <dig> segregating population, which may show the positions of markers in the maps of cultivated and wild pistacia species, is underway.

CONCLUSIONS
restriction site-associated dna sequencing  technology was used to identify sex-linked markers in pistachio. thirty-eight putative sex-linked markers were detected from  <dig> reads following radseq. thirteen single nucleotide polymorphism  loci were suitable for primer design, and eight of these could distinguish sex with complete accuracy in pistachio following validation in mature f <dig> progenies, and in a large germplasm collection by snapshot analysis. sex-linked snp markers were tested by high-resolution melting  analysis with real-time pcr for cost-effective application in a cultivar-breeding program, and four of them perfectly distinguished sex. female heterogamety of all sex-linked snp markers suggests a zz/zw sex determination system in pistachio. the reported female-to-male segregation ratio of 1: <dig> in all reported segregated populations, and no reports of super-female genotypes or heteromorphic sex chromosomes in pistachio suggests that the ww genotype is not viable. we therefore propose that the evolution of the sex chromosome is at stage  <dig>  where a pair of primitive sex chromosomes controls sex determination, with a female-specific region on the w chromosome.
