BACKGROUND
as carbapenems are among the most reliable therapeutic options for treating pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, the finding of carbapenem resistance is an ominous development that challenges this “last resort antibiotic”. production of metallo-β-lactamases  is an important mechanism of carbapenem resistance, not only because mbls can hydrolyse most β-lactams including carbapenems, but mbl-producing p. aeruginosa are frequently also multidrug-resistant   <cit> . more importantly, blambl genes are often located in the gene cassette  arrays in integrons, where multiple resistant determinants against antimicrobials or disinfectants are accumulated, and can be horizontally transferred  <cit> .

multilocus sequence typing , a genotyping method based on nucleotide sequencing of several house-keeping genes in the bacterial chromosome, has been increasingly applied for epidemiological investigation of pathogenic microorganisms  <cit> . in p. aeruginosa isolates, international clones such as st   <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  and st <dig> are reported to have widespread dissemination  <cit> . most notably, st <dig> and their close variants  appear prominent in multiple-drug resistance.

recently, the integrall database was developed for providing a systematic nomenclature for integrons  <cit> ; these genetic elements can be potentially shared by a wide range of microorganisms as a result of horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . moreover, gc arrays of integrons could be excised or integrated by the action of integrases and therefore be more diverse  <cit> . therefore, integrall is expected to facilitate our comprehensive understanding of the complexity and development of integron-mediated drug resistance.

in japan, as many as 80-90% of the mbl-producing p. aeruginosa were reported to be resistant to carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and quinolones  <cit> . notably, several molecular epidemiological surveys report the increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa ; in these the predominance of imp-type mbl genes as well as st <dig> and st <dig> among mdrp is documented  <cit> . although the prevalence of mbl among p. aeruginosa clinical isolates was reported as 2-4%  <cit> , molecular epidemiology of mbl-producing p. aeruginosa in consecutive nationwide surveillance programs has not been analysed.

in the current study, we conducted a molecular epidemiological survey of the genetic context of mbl-producing p. aeruginosa isolates collected by nationwide surveillance. our data not only provide an important “snapshot” of the molecular characteristics and dynamics of mbl-producing predominant lineages including st <dig> and st <dig>  but also provide important baseline information for future surveillance programs. 

RESULTS
antimicrobial susceptibility of mbl-producing p. aeruginosa isolates
in the present study,  <dig> mbl-producing p. aeruginosa isolates were identified ; these were recovered from  <dig> out of  <dig> geographic regions across japan. the number of isolates is comparable in  <dig> and in  <dig>  mbl-producers were isolated more frequently from urinary tract specimens than from other specimens . although this trend was consistent with the previous reports in japan  <cit> , the reason for preference of mbl-producers for urinary tract was not addressed in this study where we did not analyse non-mbl-producers.table  <dig>

a3′-conserved segment  was unknown and therefore no integron number was attributed.



acknowledging that clsi breakpoints were not available, the majority of mbl-producers showed increased susceptibility to arbekacin . although further investigation is needed, this agent might be a candidate for consideration as a therapeutic agent  <cit> . for more than two decades in japan, arbekacin is a commercially available aminoglycoside effective against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections and its use in gram negative infections is being explored .

mbl genes and class  <dig> integrons among mbl-producing p. aeruginosa
among mbl-producing p. aeruginosa isolates, seven different mbl genes were identified. the most prevalent was blaimp- <dig> group found in  <dig> isolates  , followed by  <dig> blaimp- <dig>   <dig> blaimp- <dig> group , and  <dig> blavim- <dig>  as anticipated   <cit> . while blaimp- <dig> and blaimp- <dig> were found both in  <dig> and  <dig>  blaimp- <dig>  blaimp- <dig>  and blaimp- <dig> emerged in  <dig> 

all mbl-producing isolates possessed inti <dig>  and all mbl genes were located in the gc arrays of class  <dig> integron ;  <dig> distinct mbl-harboring integrons were identified. complete gc arrays of all integrons except one were successfully sequenced, as many as  <dig> of which were novel to integall database. fifteen isolates harbored in113-like integrons, which consisted of  <dig> gcs, namely blaimp- <dig> group cassette  followed by aaca <dig> and aaca1a gcs. similarly, thirteen isolates harbored in994-like integrons which contains a sole blaimp- <dig> group cassette . the family of blambl genes and their position in integron gc arrays did not show significant differences in resistance profile .

genotypes and their relationship with integrons among mbl-producing p. aeruginosa
among mbl-producing p. aeruginosa isolates, nine different sts were identified by mlst: the most prevalent was st <dig>  followed by st <dig>  and st <dig>  . while these major  <dig> sts were found both in  <dig> and  <dig>  the other  <dig> sts were found either in  <dig> or in  <dig> 

most integrons distributed in the specific genotypes of the isolates. in113-like integrons were found in st235/pulsotype b isolates with significantly high frequency , while partial blaimp-7-harboring integron was exclusively found in st235/pulsotype c . while distributed across  <dig> geographic regions in total, st <dig> was significantly associated with kanto region . st <dig> was also associated with resistance to piperacillin . although not significant, a trend of increased st <dig> in  <dig> was observed .

mbl-producing st <dig> isolates seemed the dominant mdrp lineage in japan as also reported worldwide  <cit> . as st <dig> isolates are described as harboring a variety of resistance determinants including integrons, its diverse geographic distribution across japan reflects part of the worldwide dissemination. especially, isolates of st235/pulsotype b with in113-like integron, recovered from  <dig> regions in the present study, were well characterized as a representative of the mdrp in japan  <cit> .

in our analysis, st <dig> was significantly associated with in994-like integrons . st <dig> is another widely disseminated lineage also found in the present study  <cit> . concurrently, st <dig> was found in chugoku region with significantly higher frequency , which might possibly reflect local transmission. however, st <dig> harbored  <dig> different integrons in total, including  <dig> with blaimp- <dig> group gcs emerged in  <dig> .

the significant association of specific genotypes and integrons implies that, in a relatively short period of time, dissemination and transmission of the preexisting resistant lineage, rather than horizontal gene transfer or recombination in situ, might largely explain their endemicity. moreover, the genotypes of mbl-producers were unexpectedly similar to those in the central europe with different resistant determinants, suggesting their possible advantage beyond other genotypes in the clinical settings  <cit> . although the isolate number was small, the present study elucidated the emergence of st <dig> isolates with novel integrons in distant geographic regions in  <dig>  as well as an emergence of the st235/pulsotype c with partial integron harboring blaimp- <dig> in kanto region, which might suggest the increased complexity of endemic lineages. in addition, isolates with st <dig> was recovered in kyushu with significantly higher frequency .

one of the limitations of the present study is that this is retrospective in nature and therefore the results are not expected to be directly applied to the current clinical situation. there are also several reports in japan addressing a variety of integron structures of p. aeruginosa  <cit> , and they seemed to contain identical or similar integrons to ones identified in the current study. nevertheless, the findings here are important, since most of the integron structures were novel to integrall database  <cit> ; this could be explained by the lack of comprehensive platform for integron structure and nomenclature before the development of integrall database until recently. alternatively, this might reflect true heterogeneity and diversity of the integrons among clinical isolates, especially among non-predominant lineages. moreover, mlst comparison of cross-sectional nationwide survey is much informative for understanding of the dynamics of drug-resistant organisms. in addition, this is the first report of the presence of novel fosi gene cassette other than mycobacterium spp.  <cit> , and further analysis regarding the actual transfer route beyond the boundary of the species is warranted. as genotyping including mlst and integrall has been increasingly applied for tracking the development of the drug resistance rationally, the data in the present study would provide a robust baseline to estimate the current trend and future diversification of the drug-resistant lineages  <cit> . another shortcoming of this study is that horizontal gene transfer of blamlb genes, possibly located on plasmid or chromosome, was not experimentally addressed.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study offers an important “snapshot” of the molecular characteristics and dynamics of mbl-producing p. aeruginosa lineages including st <dig> and st <dig> across japan and provide critical information for the design and implementation of surveillance programs targeted to the discovery of multidrug resistant p. aeruginosa.
