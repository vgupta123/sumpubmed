BACKGROUND
the introduction of gene expression vectors into vertebrate cells is a powerful way to investigate gene function. following transgene integration into the genome of a recipient cell, stable, heritable phenotypes are studied in cultured cells, or  in a developing/adult animal. transgenes are typically used either to express or down-regulate a specific target gene, the latter being achieved via the use of rna interference  or site-specific recombinases  whose recognition sequences  have been engineered into the target gene. in cases where the gain or loss of gene function places host cells at a selective disadvantage, is lethal, or has different consequences at different developmental stages, temporally and/or spatially regulated transgene expression is necessary  <cit> .

temporally regulated transgene expression can be achieved with a variety of regulatory systems, but the most widely used are based on the tetracycline  repressor tetr. the original tet-off system  <cit>  is based on the tet-transactivator , a fusion protein between tetr and a minimal transactivation domain of the viral vp <dig> protein. in the absence of tet, tta binds to teto recognition sequences in the tet response element  upstream of the gene to be regulated, and activates rna polymerase ii-dependent transcription from an adjacent minimal promoter . when tet is present, tta dissociates from the tre and transcription ceases. many variations on the tet-off system have been developed  often with the aim of improving stringency. a stringent system here refers to one with minimal transgene expression before induction and robust expression after induction.

use of tet-regulated transgenes either to express or silence a target gene is already widespread in both cell lines and animals, but new applications continue to be developed. for example, with the growing use of site-specific recombinases  <cit> , rna polymerase ii-based methods for stably expressing short hairpin rna , and the expression of inducible transgenes in host cells with disrupted target alleles  <cit> , the scope for tet-regulated gene silencing is still expanding. while good stringencies are often described in such studies, these can be time-consuming to generate and, depending on the purpose of the study, may be less than ideal.

chromosomal position effects  <cit>  at the site of transgene integration are key variables in the success of these approaches as they can adversely affect the stringency of tet-regulation. as a direct result, position effects increase the effort required to identify cell or animal lines with sufficiently stringent transgene regulation, and complicate the comparisons between different lines. when evaluating lines expressing two related inducible transgenes, for example, any phenotypic variations can reflect differences either between the protein products of the transgenes or, more trivially, between their induced expression levels, as determined by the transgene integration sites. dissimilar phenotypes can also indicate dysregulation of different host genes close to the transgene integration sites  <cit> .

to date, the influence of position effects on tet-regulation has been limited in two different ways. one method uses insulator sequences  <cit>  to protect the transgene from surrounding sequences . while this has been useful in increasing stringency  <cit> , variation between different clones remains. in another approach, site-specific recombination  is used to integrate tet-regulated transgenes at specific chromosomal loci  <cit> . this approach effectively eliminates variations between clones, allowing for reproducible induction characteristics, but its success in improving stringency depends on the chosen integration site and this has not been systematically optimised.

here we describe a new approach in which clones with optimal integration sites are first identified by flow cytometric screens of cells that have been stably transfected with a loxp-tagged reporter transgene . cre-mediated recombination is then used to insert a promoterless gene of interest  at the loxp site of such clones. we have validated this approach, which we term "screen and insert' , using luciferase as a test goi and two different implementation strategies. we have also used the method to generate clones that stringently regulate the expression of i-scei, an endonuclease widely used to study cellular responses to the formation of dna double strand breaks   <cit> , and rad <dig>  a protein involved in the repair of dsbs by homologous recombination  <cit> .

RESULTS
screen and insert: principles and implementation strategies
an outline of the basic screen and insert approach is shown in fig. 1a. a target construct is made in which a reporter gene  is expressed from a tet-responsive promoter  with a loxp site positioned between the trp and the reporter gene. stably transfected clones, each with the target construct randomly integrated at a different site, are screened by flow cytometry to identify those with stringently tet-regulated egfp expression. a chosen clone is then co-transfected with a cre-expression plasmid and an insertion construct in which a promoterless goi cassette is linked to a loxp site. cre-mediated recombination between the insertion construct and the integrated target construct places the goi under the control of the trp in the chosen clone. correct insertion events generate clones with stringently tet-regulated goi and no gfp expression.

in the present study we have tested two of many possible ways in which the basic scin strategy can be implemented. we will refer to these as scin- <dig> and scin- <dig> and their key features are summarised in fig. 1b and 1c, respectively. the target construct  used for both scin- <dig> and scin- <dig> carries a destabilised egfp reporter gene  driven by an optimised trp . positioned between the trp and d2egfp are a recognition site  for the flp site-specific recombinase, and a mutant loxp site, lox <dig>  the frt site is necessary for scin- <dig> only. lox <dig> was chosen because it is known to undergo unidirectional cre-dependent recombination with lox <dig>  <cit> . thus, by use of a lox <dig> site in the insertion construct, unimolecular cre-mediated excision events that reverse the desired integration events, are minimised.

in scin- <dig>  the goi  is linked to a promoterless drug resistance marker gene  by an internal ribosome entry site . with this arrangement it is possible to select in drug  for the desired insertion events. a limitation of scin- <dig> is that for drug selection to work the goi must also be expressed. in scin- <dig> this limitation is avoided by use of an insertion construct in which a promoterless drug-resistance gene  is linked to the goi  by an frt site. this arrangement allows insertion events to be selected in drug  without any accompanying goi expression. efficient flp-mediated excision is then used to delete the drug-resistance marker and bring the goi under the control of the trp, in the presence of tet.

screening: identification of clones with stringently regulated target constructs
target constructs  were introduced into host cells by co-electroporation with a plasmid  conferring resistance to puromycin . two ht <dig>  derivatives were used as host cells: ht <dig>  <cit> , which expresses the original tta protein, or rht <dig>  which expresses itta  <cit> , an improved tta whose gene is modified to eliminate cpg dinucleotides and potential splice sites from the prokaryotic coding dna and to introduce eukaryotic codon-usage. ht <dig> cells were used as a recipient for all target constructs except ptarg <dig>  for which rht <dig> was used. most  of puromycin-resistant  colonies expressed gfp as judged by fluorescence microscopy. these were expanded and tested flow cytometrically for tet-regulated gfp expression . we sought to identify clones with: i) high gfp expression in the absence of tet, ii) low gfp in the presence of tet , and iii) 'single peak' profiles, i.e. uniform expression throughout the population, whether in the presence or the absence of tet.

an initial target construct  used the original tre  <cit> . of over  <dig> puror ptarg <dig> transfectants, many showed good regulation, but even the best expressed significant uninduced levels of gfp and required  <dig> h for full down-regulation . to facilitate screening we used a second target construct  with d2egfp as reporter. this reporter has reduced half-life compared to egfp. over  <dig> puror ptarg <dig> transfectants were screened, but none completely silenced gfp expression in the presence of tet. flow cytometric profiles of the best-regulated clones are shown in fig. 2c. when a target construct  with an improved tre was used,  <dig> of  <dig> puror clones analysed had uninduced gfp expression levels of less than twice the background level, but these showed heterogeneous gfp expression in the absence of tet . experiments with the methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine  indicated that heterogeneous expression was caused by dna methylation of the tta gene  <cit> . for example, when t <dig>  one of the clones transfected with ptarg <dig>  was treated with azc for  <dig> h, a marked increase in gfp-expressing cells was observed . furthermore, luciferase expression in the same clone transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter gene linked to the improved tre  was also stimulated  by a  <dig> h treatment of the cells with azc prior to the transfection . this latter experiment suggested that methylation of the tta gene, not the tre, was responsible heterogeneous expression. the relatively homogeneous gfp expression seen in ptarg <dig> and ptarg2-transfected clones  probably reflects the use of lower passages of ht <dig> cells that were less likely to have suffered tta gene silencing.

to minimise tta gene methylation, the itta-expressing ht <dig> line rht <dig> was made  and used for a final screening experiment. to allow subsequent testing of both scin- <dig> and scin- <dig>  an frt-tagged target construct  was used. of  <dig> puror clones analysed,  <dig> had uninduced gfp expression levels of <2-fold above background combined with acceptable single-peak profiles , while others showed heterogeneous expression . the two best clones  were chosen for further analysis.

both rht14- <dig> and rht14- <dig> were found by southern blot analysis  to carry a single copy of ptarg <dig>  to test for stability of expression, clone rht14- <dig> was cultured continuously for  <dig> days during which time the profile of gfp expression remained largely unchanged . a comparison of flow cytometric and immunoblot analyses of tet-induced gfp down-regulation in clone rht14- <dig> illustrates one of the advantages of screening by flow cytometry, namely its sensitivity . thus, substantial above-background gfp expression, readily detectable by flow cytometry, is undetectable on immunoblots. a second advantage of flow cytometric screening is its ability to detect and eleminate heterogeneously expressing clones, such as those in fig. 2d and 2g, which would have been difficult or impossible to identify by bulk measurements of gfp expression .

scin- <dig> insertion
the insertion construct pin- <dig>  was co-lipofected with a cre expression construct  into  <dig> ×  <dig> rht14- <dig> cells to generate  <dig> hygromycin-resistant  colonies. in a control experiment, identical except for the omission of pmc-cre, no hygror colonies were generated. of  <dig> hygror colonies examined,  <dig> had lost gfp expression and became sensitive to hygromycin when tet was added , both expected consequences of the desired integration event. dna fragments diagnostic for the expected insertion event were detected in all  of the gfp-negative, hygror clones analysed by pcr and southern blots . the same  <dig> clones also showed similar patterns of tet-regulated luciferase expression . these results show that the desired cre-mediated insertion step occurs at a frequency of approximately10- <dig> per transfected cell  to generate tet-regulated goi expression in a reproducible manner. given the stringency of gfp expression in clone rht14- <dig>  the background of luciferase expression in the insertion clones was surprisingly high. based on the better stringencies obtained with clone rht14- <dig> using scin- <dig> , this background may indicate some activation of the trp by unidentified sequences in pin- <dig> 

scin- <dig> insertion
the insertion construct pin- <dig>  was co-lipofected with pmc-cre into  <dig> ×  <dig> rht14- <dig> or rht14- <dig> cells to generate  <dig> and  <dig> mpa/x-resistant  colonies, respectively. no mpa/xr colonies developed in the control transfections lacking pmc-cre. of the  <dig> rht14-10-derived colonies,  <dig> had lost gfp expression and became sensitive to mpa/x when tet was added . of the  <dig> rht14-19-derived colonies,  <dig> had lost gfp expression and became sensitive to mpa/x when tet was added . nine gfp-negative, mpa/xr clones from each parental clone were analysed by genomic pcr, and all were positive for the  <dig> bp pcr product diagnostic for the expected integration . four insertion clones, one derived from rht14- <dig>  and three from rht14- <dig> , were analysed by southern blot and all showed the expected change in structure . together, these results indicate that the desired insertion event occurred at frequencies of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> per transfected cell in clones rht14- <dig> or rht14- <dig>  respectively .

flp-mediated deletion
two insertion clones , one of each parental type, were chosen for flp-mediated deletion. cells grown with tet  for at least  <dig> h were lipofected  with the flp expression plasmid pcaggs-flpe , and cultured at low density with tet until colonies appeared. colonies were analysed by genomic pcr. for flp-treated 10in <dig> cells,  <dig> pools  were assayed and  <dig> pools produced the predicted  <dig> bp pcr product  indicative of flp-mediated deletion . individual clones from two positive pools  were analysed by the same pcr assay and 6/ <dig> were positive for the  <dig> bp product . the efficiency of flp-mediated deletion was thus at least  <dig>  , and probably closer to  <dig>  , events per transfected cell. a southern blot of two such clones  was consistent with the predicted structures . the  <dig> flp-deleted clones showed highly stringent tet-regulated luciferase expression . above-background levels of uninduced luciferase expression were detectable, but all clones showed induction ratios approaching  <dig> -fold, consistent with the gfp inducibility of parental clone rht14- <dig> 

for flp-treated 19in <dig> cells,  <dig> pools  were assayed by pcr . two pools  were positive, each due to the presence of a single clone 19flp <dig>  and 19flp <dig> , respectively. the relatively low efficiency of flp-mediated deletion in 19in <dig>  probably reflects a lower efficiency of pcaggs-flpe delivery due to the inclusion of tet in lipofection mix of that particular transfection. southern blot  and pcr analysis , showed that 19flp <dig>  was impure, the majority of cells being of parental  type. southern analysis of the other flp-deleted clone , however, confirmed that it had undergone the expected deletion . clone 19flp <dig>  showed highly stringent tet-regulation of luciferase expression with an induction ratio of more than  <dig> -fold and uninduced expression levels barely above background .

use of scin- <dig> to generate cells with inducible i-scei or rad <dig> expression
having validated the scin method, we put it into practice using scin- <dig> with genes for i-scei or rad <dig> as our gois. for these experiments a modified insertion pin- <dig> vector  was used with a different selectable marker gene  followed by a multiple cloning site . the open reading frames  encoding i-scei or rad <dig>  the former with a n-terminal haemaglutinin  tag, were cloned into pin2-neomcs to generate pin2-neosce and pin2-neor <dig>  these plasmids were co-lipofected with pmc-cre into rht14- <dig> and g418r colonies were selected, > 96% of which had lost gfp expression. of six such clones tested, three each of the pin-neosce- and pin-neor52-transfected clones, all were found to become sensitive to g <dig> in tet and to be positive in pcr assays for targeted integration . in this way site-specific insertion frequencies of between  <dig>  and  <dig>  × 10- <dig> were estimated for pin2-neomcs and it derivatives, at least 20-fold higher than with pin- <dig> 

two clones, 10in-sce. <dig>  10in-r <dig>   were grown in +tet medium, lipofected  with pcaggs-flpe and plated at low dilution in +tet medium. the majority of the resulting colonies were positive in a pcr assay for the deletion event, suggesting highly efficient flp-mediate deletion . two clones of high purity  as judged by pcr were analysed further. immunoblot analyses confirmed the expected tet-regulated expression of the appropriate goi  in these clones . expression in the presence of tet was undetectable indicating, as far as is possible by immunoblotting, highly stringent tet-regulation.

to test for functionality of the induced i-scei, and as a more robust test for the stringency of tet-regulation, 10in-sce.1flp <dig> was transfected with pdrneo  <cit> . this substrate for homologous recombination carries a functional hygromycin resistance cassette flanked by two defective neo cassettes, one being disrupted in its coding sequence by the  <dig> bp recognition site for i-scei. cleavage of the first neo cassette by i-scei greatly stimulates its conversion to a functional neo cassette by homology directed dna repair using the second neo cassette as a template. before transfection with pdrneo, the purity of 10in-sce.1flp <dig> was further demonstrated by plating three million cells in g <dig> without tet: no colonies formed even though parental 10in-sce. <dig> cells grow in these conditions. following transfection of 10in-sce.1flp <dig> with pdrneo, three hygror clones, selected and expanded with tet in the growth medium, were tested for the presence of g418r cells after a period  of growth with or without tet. the results  show that i-scei induction causes > 104-fold stimulations in gene conversion, with absolute frequencies reaching 3–7% of all cells. these effects are at least as pronounced as those previously described after transient transfection of an i-scei expression construct  <cit> . variations between clones in the absolute frequencies of g418r are most likely caused by different chromosomal position effects on the integrated pdrneo. the low frequencies of g418r colonies  detected in the continuous presence of tet are likely to reflect spontaneous recombination of the pdrneo substrate rather than recombination stimulated by residual i-scei expression: similar frequencies of spontaneous g418r have been described for pdrneo in ht <dig>  <cit> , hek <dig>  <cit>  and cho  <cit>  cells that have never been transfected with an i-scei gene. furthermore, these frequencies are no higher than the spontaneous g418r frequency  observed for a hygror clone derived from pdrneo-transfected rht <dig> cells . this frequency was also unaffected by tet removal, excluding the possibility that tet reduced g418r colony formation independently of its effect on i-scei expression. taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that i-scei is functional and regulated with very high stringency following its targeted integration by use of the scin- <dig> method.

discussion
the "screen and insert"  methods described here provide convenient and reproducible ways to isolate clones in which transgene expression is stringently regulated by tet. a great variety of modifications and improvements to the original tet-off system have been reported. versatility, convenience, stringency and stability have been variously extended by the development of the reverse tta  system  <cit> , the combined use of tet-regulated activation and repression  <cit> , systems for single-vector delivery and/or autoregulation  <cit>  and by modifications to the tre  <cit>  or the transactivator protein/gene  <cit> . despite such improvements, the tet system remains subject to the influence of chromosome position effects, complicating the isolation of optimally regulated clones. the scin methods address this problem.

the key to scin is the combination of a powerful gfp-based screen to identify optimal chromosomal loci, and the use of ssr to target the insertion of transgenes at such sites. screening by flow cytometry is valuable because it allows lines with even very small amounts of leaky expression, or with cellular heterogeneity of expression, to be eliminated. furthermore, for a given cell line, one can envisage collecting a range of clones with different induction characteristics, from which one can choose the clone most suitable for a particular application. the ease with which many clones can be screened increases the chances of finding one in which optimal regulation is achieved. although we screened clones individually here, it may be even more convenient in future to use flow sorting to purify and clone the best cells from a population of transfectants.

it is important to note that, once screening has been used to identify a clone  with a stringently regulated reporter, the use of ssr to insert the goi at the reporter locus is relatively labour-unintensive and can be used repeatedly for different gois. in scin <dig>  for example, the following three steps are now sufficient to generate an ht <dig> clone with any goi under highly stringent tet-regulation: i) clone goi into multiple cloning site of pin2-neomcs and co-transfect with pmc-cre into rht14- <dig>  selecting for g418r colonies. ii) expand a g418r/gfp- colony, confirm g418r is tet-sensitive , transfect with pcaagflpe  and plate at low density in tet. iii) identify one of the >10% of colonies that is no longer g418r when tet is removed.

scin has at least three advantages over the standard approach of immunoblot-screening of multiple clones with randomly integrated goi. first, no screening for goi expression is required to identify the desired clone. second, tet-regulation of the goi is likely to be much more stringent and lacking in cellular heterogeneity. third, the same protocol can be used repeatedly with different gois to generate clones whose phenotypes can be compared without the complication of differential expression levels. these advantages will be attractive for a range of studies, including in both gain- and loss-of-function experiments. the expression of i-scei provides a good illustration of the former. leaky expression of this endonuclease will lead to repeated cutting and repair of any i-scei recognition sites in the host genome, until inaccurate repair by non-homologous end-joining  <cit>  results in the loss of i-scei sites. the ability to induce dsb, and measure cellular responses, will therefore be irreversibly lost if expression is leaky. the importance of minimal leakiness in loss-of-function experiments is illustrated by systems in which a tet-regulated transgene is expressed in cells whose corresponding endogenous alleles have been inactivated  <cit> . switching off the tet-regulated transgene in such systems will produce a true null phenotype only when there is no leakiness.

success of the scin method depends on optimal reporter gene regulation from the target construct and this was achieved best with ptarg <dig>  stringent regulation from the other contructs  was limited by use of the original tre and/or by host cells that expressed tta rather itta. although we saw no signs of structural instability or unstable gene expression at ptarg <dig> loci, the persistence of prokaryotic vector sequences at transgene loci can in some circumstances be problematic  <cit> . removal of unwanted vector dna from target and insertion constructs prior to transfection might therefore be considered desirable. for target constructs this may be achieved simply by digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes. for insertion constructs, which must remain circular, this might be achievable by inclusion of a second loxp site and use of cre recombinase in vitro.

the use of ssr to integrate transgenes at sites that support tissue-specific or ubiquitous expression in mice is established  <cit> . for tet-regulated expression, ssr has been used to target either to defined loci, such as the hprt  <cit>  or cola <dig>  <cit>  genes in mouse embryonic stem  cells, and the dhfr locus in chinese hamster ovary  cells locus <cit> , or to specific but undefined loci in e.g. cho  <cit> , human cervical  <cit>  and rat pancreatic cells  <cit> . while these systems introduce the valuable aspect of reproducibility into transgene integration in a given cell line, the chosen target sites are not necessarily optimal for stringency or for cellular homogeneity of induction. furthermore, establishing these systems in new cell lines is demanding.

in an approach more closely related to scin, puttini et al  <cit>  used i-scei-stimulated homologous recombination  to target transgenes to a locus that was identified by its ability to support stringent tet-regulation of another reporter, secreted alkaline phosphatase . in practice, this approach was limited by the low efficiency of hr-mediated integration, the inability to use seap assays to assess cellular heterogeneity and the presence of a promoter/enhancer close to the tre. in another approach related to scin, a tet-regulated gpt gene was linked to a promoterless goi and randomly integrated into the genome  <cit> . after selecting clones with optimally-regulated gpt, ssr was use to invert the dna segment carrying gpt and goi, placing the goi under control of a tre. this system suffered from the low stringency of gpt selection and the need to select optimally-regulated clones for each new goi.

emphasis in this paper has been on the use of transgenes for the analysis of gene function in cultured cells. the scin may also be valuable when extended to mice. for this, however, methods must be developed to screen for es cell clones that support tet-regulated gfp expression not just in culture, but also in all tissues of es-derived animals. provided its tta/rtta gene can be deleted , the chosen clone can then be used repeatedly for the targeted insertion of any goi, and the generation of mice to be crossed with transgenic lines chosen for their tissue-specific expression of tta/rtta.

CONCLUSIONS
the screen and insert approach described is a highly effective way to achieve stringent and reproducible tet-regulated transgene expression. reagents developed here  can be used immediately in a simple 3-step protocol to achieve such expression in an ht <dig> background. furthermore, additional reagents we describe , can be used to establish the select and insert method in other cell lines. the method is particularly attractive for analyses of gene function in situations where the gene product is likely to have biological effects even when expressed at very low levels and/or where the effects of several related genes are to be compared. cell lines expressing stringently regulated i-scei or rad <dig>  generated in the course of this study, will be useful in studies of dna damage and repair.
