BACKGROUND
thiamine pyrophosphate  is a cofactor found in virtually all living systems and is important to the function of enzymes in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle , amino acid biosynthesis, and other metabolic pathways  <cit> . many prokaryotes and some eukaryotes  can synthesize tpp  <cit> , whereas mammals and other vertebrates require this cofactor in their diet in the form of vitamin b <dig>   <cit> . this “thio-“or “sulfur-containing” vitamin consists of a thiazole ring linked to a pyrimidine, with the moieties synthesized separately and then coupled to form thiamine  <cit> .

thiazole biosynthesis in bacteria is well characterized and involves a complex chain of oxidative condensation reactions that use 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate, glycine  and a sulfur source  <cit> . sulfur is thought to be derived from cysteine and incorporated into the thiazole ring by a series of enzyme-mediated sulfur transfer steps that include this, thif, thig, thii, and iscs . in this process, this is adenylated at its c-terminus by thif in a mechanism analogous to the activation of ubiquitin. the adenylated this is converted to a thiocarboxylate at the c-terminal glycine residue by sulfur transfer from thii and cysteine desulfurase . this thiocarboxylate serves as a sulfur donor for formation of the thiazole ring via thiazole synthase .

molecular details of thiazole ring formation in fungi, yeast and plants are revealed by study of thi <dig> family proteins. early work demonstrated that thi <dig> gene expression is repressed by thiamine and that disruption of this gene in yeast generates strains that are auxotrophic for thiamine, but able to grow in the presence of a thiazole precursor of thiamine  <cit> . thus, yeast thi4p was examined for thiazole ring formation and found to catalyze a single turnover reaction in which thi4p cys <dig> serves as the source of sulfur to form a thiazole precursor of thiamine with nad and glycine as co-substrates  <cit> .

thiazole biosynthesis in archaea is poorly understood. most archaea have homologs that cluster to the thi <dig> family  of proteins, but lack the conserved cysteine residue of the yeast thi4p that is required for sulfur transfer in formation of the thiazole ring and instead have a histidine residue which is well conserved. there are conflicting reports on the function of these archaeal thi <dig> homologs. initially, the proteins from methanocaldococcus jannaschii  and methanosarcina acetivorans  were reported to convert ribose- <dig> -bisphosphate  into ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate, the substrate of ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase   <cit> . with respect to the experimental details, however, the authors did not measure the assumed activity of a r15p isomerase  but measured stimulation of incorporation of labeled co <dig> into an acid-stable compound which was identified as pga , the product of rubisco. as an additional complication, the starting product 5-phosphoryl-1-pyrophosphate had to be subjected to heat treatment prior to performing the assay. despite this ambiguity, the conclusions of the initial report with respect to the existence of an archaeal r15p isomerase activity have been confirmed in a subsequent study  <cit> . these authors directly measured r15p isomerase activity and even put this activity into the wider context of an amp metabolic pathway . however, they assigned the r15p isomerase activity to a completely different protein. this protein, referred to as tk-e2b <dig>  is tk <dig>   <cit> . tk <dig> clusters with the e2b <dig> family  and has no resemblance whatsoever with members of the thi <dig> family. tk <dig> was active in an in vitro r15p isomerase assay. the authors also tested tk <dig>  the thermococcus thi <dig> family member and ortholog of mj <dig>  in their in vitro r15p isomerase assay, but did not detect any activity. in addition, they point out that the three enzymes of their amp metabolic pathway  and deoa) share a common phylogenetic profile while tk <dig> does not. this implies that the original function assignment to mj <dig> and ma_ <dig> as r15p isomerase may not be correct. whatever the function of mj <dig> and the other thi <dig> members with a histidine rather than cysteine may be, there is not the slightest hint that it may be related to thiamine biosynthesis.

here we report that archaeal thi <dig> homologs with a conserved catalytic cysteine residue are linked to thiamine biosynthesis. deletion of the hvthi <dig> gene homolog  of haloferax volcanii was found to confer an auxotrophic requirement for thiamine. the conserved active site cysteine residue of hvthi <dig>  was needed to restore the growth of this thiamine autotroph to wild-type levels. overall, our results provide new insight that archaeal thi <dig> family  members with conserved active site cysteine residues are important in thiamine biosynthesis and that most halophilic archaea and ammonia oxidizing archaea  are likely to use a thi4-type mechanism for sulfur relay to the thiazole ring.

RESULTS
two distinct mechanisms for incorporating sulfur into the thiazole ring of thiamine predicted in select archaea by genomic reconstruction
an updated genomic comparison of thiamine metabolism homologs of select archaea was performed . based on this analysis, hfx. volcanii and related archaea were predicted to use bacterial related enzymes for synthesis of the pyrimidine moiety  of thiamine. by contrast, the mechanism used for formation of 4-methyl-5- thiazole phosphate  containing the thiazole ring was less clear for these organisms. a critical step in formation of the thiazole ring is the incorporation of sulfur. genomic reconstruction detected two distinct mechanisms for sulfur transfer to synthesize the thiazole ring including: a bacterial thif-this related system  and a yeast thi4p-type mechanism . however, a conundrum existed in that the ubaa-samp system lacked a predicted interaction partner  and that archaeal thi <dig> homologs  are reported to function as r15p isomerases  <cit> , thus being unrelated to thiamine biosynthesis. to shed some light into this enigma, we analyzed the members of the thi <dig> protein family in more detail.

haloarchaea and other select archaea have thi <dig> homologs with a conserved active site cysteine
to determine the metabolic potential of the archaeal members of the thi <dig> protein family  in thiamine biosynthesis, archaeal homologs were compared to thi4p of yeast  and plant  by multiple amino acid sequence alignment and cluster analysis . by these comparisons, the majority of archaeal thi <dig> homologs were found to have a histidine residue conserved in the position of the active site cysteine residue  of the yeast thi4p, with some even having a proline residue. archaeal thi <dig> ‘histidine-containing’ homologs from methanogenic archaea  are implicated in r15p isomerase reactions not associated with thiamine metabolism to provide ribulose-bisphosphate as a substrate of archaeal ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase  <cit> . in a subsequent study, archaeal r15p isomerases were put into a wider context of co <dig> fixation via the amp pathway  <cit> . phylogenetic profile analysis as well as in vivo and in vitro studies assigned r15p isomerase activity to tk <dig>  a protein unrelated to thi4p  <cit> . by contrast, the thi4p homolog of t. kododaraensis  did not show any r15p isomerase activity by in vitro analysis  <cit> . even though the results of these earlier studies are controversial  <cit> , none implicates a thi4p homolog to be involved in thiamine biosynthesis in an archaeon.figure  <dig>

the scthi4p cys <dig> residue is highly conserved among eukaryotic thi <dig> homologs, is required for thi <dig> activity, and is thought to be used as a sulfur donor in an iron-mediated sulfur transfer reaction to form the thiazole ring, based on ms-based detection of a dehydroalanine residue at this position after a single-turnover reaction  <cit> . since the majority of archaeal thi <dig> homologs lack the conserved active site cysteine, these enzymes are not predicted to use a yeast thi4p-type mechanism of thiazole biosynthesis. however, a subset of archaeal thi <dig> homologs was detected that displayed not only an overall amino acid sequence similarity to scthi <dig>  but also harbored a cysteine residue analogous to the scthi <dig> active site cys <dig>  for example, the hfx. volcanii thi <dig> homolog  had a conserved active site cysteine residue  and 31% overall amino acid sequence identity to scthi4p with a blast query coverage of 92% and e value of 3e- <dig>  the subset of archaeal thi <dig> homologs with the conserved active site cysteine residue was found to cluster  and included thi <dig> homologs of all of the haloarchaea and ammonium-oxidizing thaumarchaeota examined as well as the crenarchaeote aeropyrum pernix, and select euryarchaeota including pyrococcus sp. strain na <dig> and p. yayanosii strain ch <dig> as well as methanobacterium sp. strains al- <dig> and swan- <dig> . these select species of pyrococcus and methanobacterium had two thi <dig> homologs .

to further compare thi <dig> family proteins, the 3d-stuctures of the hvo_ <dig>  tk <dig> and ma_ <dig> homologs were predicted by phyre2-based fold-recognition and model building . the resulting 3d-models were overlaid with the x-ray crystal structures of thi4p of s. cerevisiae  and n. crassa   to identify structurally conserved active site residues using chimera  <dig>  to visualize the models  <cit> . conserved active site residues were identified based on analogy to residues shown to be important in scthi4p structure and activity  <cit>  as well as residues bound to adenosine diphosphate 5--4-methyl-thiazole-2-carboxylic acid  in the atomic structure of n. crassa thi4p. from this analysis, all three archaeal thi <dig> homologs were found to have close structural similarity to the yeast and fungal enzymes . however, only the hvthi <dig> protein hvo_ <dig>  was found to have residues analogous to those bound to ahz in the atomic structure of n. crassa thi4p as well as the conserved catalytic cysteine of scthi4p required for sulfur mobilization to the thiazole ring .figure  <dig>

generation of a thiamine auxotroph of haloferax volcanii by deletion of the thi <dig> homolog
to further understand the molecular mechanisms used by archaea with predicted this/thif- and thi4-type pathways to synthesize the thiazole ring of thiamine, a genetic strategy was used in which hfx. volcanii strains with targeted deletions of gene homologs in the two predicted pathways were analyzed for growth in the absence of supplied thiamine. consistent with our metabolic reconstruction results, hfx. volcanii has the metabolic capacity for thiamine biosynthesis as shown by its ability to grow on minimal medium in the absence of an exogenous source of thiamine  <cit> . hfx. volcanii is also demonstrated to synthesize key metabolic enzymes that are tpp-dependent including the 2-oxoacid : ferredoxin oxidoreductases used to mediate the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate  <cit>  and three 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases used under nitrate-respirative conditions  <cit>  including one involved in growth on isoleucine  <cit> . the Δubaa mutant required to analyze the this/thif-type pathway was already available from previous study  <cit> . a Δthi <dig>  mutant strain  was generated for this study  using a pyre based pop-in/pop-out strategy similar to generation of the Δubaa mutant .figure  <dig>

gene and its in-frame deletion.  schematic representation of the thi <dig> gene on the genome of hfx. volcanii ds <dig>  hvo_ <dig> encodes a thin homolog with a predicted n-terminal helix-turn-helix  dna binding domain. the pcr primer pairs  used to generate the thi <dig> gene deletion and the pcr primer pairs  used to screen for the thi <dig> gene deletion are indicated.  pcr products generated for the Δthi <dig>  mutant and parent  strains using primer pairs p5/p <dig> and p7/p <dig> as indicated. size reduction with primer pair p7/p <dig> and the absence of a signal with primer pair p5/p <dig> confirm the deletion in the Δthi <dig> strain.



once generated, the Δubaa and Δthi <dig> mutant strains were compared to parent h <dig> for thiamine-dependent growth. growth was monitored by optical density  under aerobic conditions on glycerol minimal medium  with and without the addition of thiamine after transfer from rich medium  and subculture from gmm  . the Δubaa and parent strains were found to exhibit generation times  of 8–10 h and specific growth rates  of  <dig>  to  <dig>  h− <dig> that were similar and relatively independent of thiamine supplementation . stationary-phase cultures of these strains  reached comparable cell densities of  <dig>  –  <dig>  od <dig> units . likewise, the Δthi <dig> mutant strain displayed growth patterns similar to the parent when cultured on medium supplemented with thiamine. however, little to no growth was observed for the Δthi <dig> mutant when successively cultured in the absence of thiamine . we classify the Δthi <dig> mutant as a thiamine auxotroph according to its growth behavior. in addition to thiamine, the growth defect of the Δthi <dig> mutant observed in the absence of thiamine could be overcome by supplementation of growth medium with the thiazole moiety 4-methyl-5-thiazole  . thus, the Δthi <dig> mutant strain is able to salvage the thz thiazole moiety for re-use in thiamine synthesis and presumably phosphorylate this to thz-p for condensation with hmp-pp , a purine derivative that is synthesized by a separate branch. these results provide strong evidence that synthesis of the thiazole moiety of thiamine  is disrupted in the Δthi <dig> mutant strain and that hfx. volcanii uses a thi4-type  mechanism for sulfur incorporation into the thiazole ring.figure  <dig>

hfx. volcanii strains including h <dig> parent , hm <dig> , nc <dig> , nc1011-pjam202c , nc1011-pjam <dig> , and nc1011-pjam <dig>  were grown in gmm supplemented with and without thiamine or thz as indicated and described in the materials and methods. first round  and successive growth curves  are presented with the mean ± standard deviations shown.



we next wanted to confirm that the thiamine auxotrophy of the hfx. volcanii Δthi <dig> mutant was directly attributed to the thi <dig> deletion by complementation analysis. we also wanted to analyze the influence of the conserved cysteine residue  on hvthi <dig> activity. to answer these questions, the Δthi <dig> mutant strain was transformed with plasmids encoding wild-type and c165a variant forms of hvthi <dig>  and the transformed strains were compared to Δthi <dig> and parent h <dig> for growth on thiamine minus medium . the plasmid expressed forms of hvthi <dig> contained a c-terminal strepii tag to facilitate detection of the protein produced in hfx. volcanii by anti-strepii western blotting. growth of the Δthi <dig> mutant strain trans complemented with a wild-type copy of thi <dig> was similar to the parent h <dig>  revealing that the thiamine auxotrophy is due to the absence of thi <dig> and not a distal effect of the in-frame deletion of this gene. addition of the c-terminal strepii tag had no apparent impact on this trans complementation suggesting hvthi4-strepii is activated. in contrast to wild type hvthi <dig>  the gene encoding the hvthi <dig> c165a variant was unable to trans complement the Δthi <dig> mutation. western blotting against the c-terminal strepii tag of hvthi <dig>  confirmed that the wild-type and c165a variant forms of hvthi <dig> were produced as proteins at similar levels in the cell suggesting that the differences in complementation are not due to hvthi <dig> protein levels and instead are based on enzyme activity. thus, the conserved active site cysteine  of hvthi <dig> is likely required for catalytic activity similarly to thi4p cys <dig> of yeast.figure  <dig> 
the thi <dig> homolog  and its c165a variant are synthesized with c-terminal strepii tags as stable derivatives in
haloferax volcanii
. production of the hvthi4-strepii and hvthi <dig> c165a-strepii proteins in the trans complemented strains  was detected by anti-strepii western blotting . equivalent protein loading was assessed by staining blots with ponceau red s  and parallel sds-page gels with coomassie blue r- <dig> .



based on these results, we suggest that thi <dig> functions as a suicide thiamine thiazole synthase in hfx. volcanii similarly to yeast  <cit> . if so, build-up of inactivated hvthi <dig> in its dehydroalanine form is anticipated. when expressed in hfx. volcanii, the primary isoform of hvthi <dig> and its c165a variant that accumulated in cells was observed at 40 kda, which is in relatively close agreement to the theoretical molecular mass of  <dig>  kda for an acidic protein  likely to bind less sds than the protein standards used to estimate its molecular mass  <cit> . however, at least four protein bands of  <dig> to 150 kda were detected for the wild type form of hvthi <dig> that were not observed for the c165a variant. if hvthi <dig> uses a suicide mechanism, the “dehydroalanine” form of hvthi <dig> cys <dig> generated after sulfur transfer to the thiazole ring precursor would be inactivate and, thus, the protein ‘reagent’ may be susceptible to aggregation or some type of post-translational modification that could facilitate its elimination from the cell. the sampylation system may fulfill this role in archaea by covalently attaching ubiquitin-like samp moieties to thi <dig> and targeting it for proteasome-mediated degradation  <cit> . alternatively, hfx. volcanii cells may have a mechanism to minimize overproduction of thiamine through modification of thi <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
here we resolve the enigma of how sulfur is incorporated into the thiazole ring of thiamine in archaea such as hfx. volcanii and propose a model in which bacterial related enzymes are used for synthesis of the pyrimidine moiety  and eukaryotic enzymes are used for formation of the thiazole derivative  of thiamine . while genomic reconstruction suggested hfx. volcanii used two distinct mechanisms for sulfur incorporation into the thiazole ring, in vivo analysis revealed that only the yeast thi4-type  system was required. in particular, the conserved catalytic cysteine residue  of the hfx. volcanii thi4p homolog  was found to be essential in the trans complementation of a Δthi <dig> mutant for growth in the absence of thiamine or thz. cluster analysis of thi4p homologs revealed a clear separation of archaeal homologs with a conserved active site cysteine residue, such as hvthi <dig>  from those having a histidine residue in its place . based on this distinction, we propose a yeast-type thi4p mechanism, which uses an active site cysteine residue for sulfur incorporation into the thiazole ring of thiamine, is relatively widespread in archaea including halophilic archaea of the phylum euryarchaeota and ammonium oxidizing archaea of the phylum thaumarchaeota.figure  <dig>
