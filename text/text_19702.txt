BACKGROUND
mastitis is the most common disease of dairy cows and mainly caused by bacterial infection of the mammary gland . subclinical form cannot be detected by naked eyes with characteristics of increased scc and decreased milk production . in china, 40–80 % of milking cows are subclinically infected, which account for the annual economic loss of more than  <dig> million dollars  <cit> . the antibiotic therapy is generally used for the treatment of mastitis, however it may lead to drug resistant bacteria and also attribute to residue in the human food chain  <cit> . in sweden, antibiotic treatment during lactation is not recommended in case of subclinical mastitis. moreover, the use of antibiotic is on prescription only  <cit> . therefore, looking for a novel alternative therapy for bovine mastitis is an urgent topic.

since the end of 1980s, sordillo and daley  <cit>  reviewed the use of cytokines as immunomodulators and potential therapeutic agents for mastitis therapy. recombinant interferon-γ has exhibited effectiveness in experimentally induced escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus imis  <cit> . the extract from the root of panax ginseng c.a. meyer has been reported to have immunomodulatory property . intramammary infusion of ginseng saponins  has been found to modulate the immunity of mammary gland by potentiating mrna expression of proinflammatory cytokines  in cows at drying off  <cit> .

atractylodis macrocephalae koidz. is a plant of compositae having its natural resource in zhejiang provinces in china. its rhizome  has been used as a traditional chinese medicine for about 2000 years  <cit> . ram consists of various active fractions, such as polysaccharides, volatile oil and lactones  <cit> . previous investigation has shown that oral administration of the extract made from ram has enhanced immune responses of mice. later investigation has shown that polysaccharides  extracted from ram is active for the immune enhancement. recent research has shown that injection of ramp together with foot-and-mouth disease  vaccine significantly enhanced both humoral and cellular immune responses . therefore, we hypothesized that injection of ramp may be useful in reduction of imis by stimulating the immunity in cows. the objective of this study was to estimate an oil emulsified ramp  as a potential therapeutic agent to treat subclinical mastitis by subcutaneous injection of ramp-o in the area of supramammary lymph node in lactating cows via analysis of scc, imis and nagase.

RESULTS
characterization of ramp
the polysaccharide contained in ramp was  <dig>  % as measured by phenol-sulfuric acid method and it did not contain reducing sugar and starch-type polysaccharides on the basis of negative fehling’s reagent and iodine-potassium iodide reactions. uv analysis and triketohydrindene hydrate reaction showed that ramp was not contaminated with protein. the ftir spectrum of ramp measured in kbr pellets was shown in fig.  <dig>  the characteristic strong broad band of absorption at  <dig>  cm− <dig> was attributed to o-h stretching vibration of the polysaccharides. the band at  <dig>  cm− <dig> was ascribed to c-h stretching vibration in carbohydrates and the band at  <dig>  cm− <dig> was due to the presence of bound water. the featured signal ester carbonyl groups at  <dig>  cm− <dig> suggested that ramp was uronic acid-contained polysaccharide. the bands in the range of 1400–1200 cm− <dig> represented the variable-angle vibrations of c-h in polysaccharides. the bands between  <dig> and 1150 cm− <dig> were attributed to the stretching vibration of c-o-c group. the characteristic peak of absorption at  <dig>  cm− <dig> was due to the variable-angle vibration of β-configuration c-h of pyrnoase, while the band at  <dig>  cm− <dig> was attributed to the variable-angle vibration of c–h of furan ring. the absorption peak at 350–660 cm− <dig> indicated that it was a pyran-type polysaccharide. the 1h nmr spectrum of ramp was shown in fig.  <dig>  in general, the vibrations at δ <dig> - <dig>  ppm indicate that the polysaccharide has an α-configuration, while the vibrations of a β-configuration are at δ <dig> - <dig>  ppm. the signals of ramp showed that it was a polysaccharide with both α and β configurations, but the β-configuration was dominant.fig.  <dig> ftir spectroscopy of ramp. the fitr spectrum of ramp showed a strong broad band of absorption at  <dig>  cm− <dig> attributed to o-h stretching vibration of the polysaccharides. the band at  <dig>  cm− <dig> was ascribed to c-h stretching vibration in carbohydrates and the band at  <dig>  cm− <dig> was due to the presence of bound water. the characteristic peak of absorption at  <dig>  cm− <dig> was due to the variable-angle vibration of β-configuration c-h of pyranose. the band at  <dig>  cm− <dig> was attributed to the variable-angle vibration of c-h of furan ring. the absorption peak at 350–660 cm− <dig> indicated that it was a pyran-type polysaccharide

stability and viscosity of ramp-o
no separation was observed between aqueous and oil phases after ramp-o was centrifuged for 15 min at 4000 rpm; it took  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  s, respectively, for the oil emulsion containing  <dig>  and 12 mg of ramp per ml to flow out of the pipette, indicating that ramp-o had a low viscosity.

irritation induced by subcutaneous injection of ramp-o in the area of supramammary lymph node
initially, we injected 32 mg of ramp-o in a clinically healthy cow with milk scc of  <dig> /ml. no visible local reactions were observed at the injection site and no obvious change of scc was detected in composite milk during 3 days following that injection . additionally, no side effects were found at the injection site throughout experiments  <dig> and  <dig> fig.  <dig> irritancy of ramp-o on milk scc. scc of composite milk in cows before and after subcutaneous injection of ramp-o in left and right areas of supramammary lymph node in cow 435



simultaneous injections of ramp-o in both left and right areas of the supramammary lymph node reduced scc and nagase activity in milk
in experiment  <dig>  low , middle  and high  doses of ramp-o were used for injection in the area of the supramammary lymph node in groups  <dig> to  <dig>  during three weeks after the treatment, both scc and nagase activity in milk were progressively declined in groups  <dig> to  <dig> . although there was no significant difference among the three groups, the highest decrease was found in groups  <dig> and  <dig>  compared with the control, scc decreased by  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively, in groups  <dig> and 3; nagase decreased by  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively, in groups  <dig> and  <dig>  since there were no significant difference between the two groups, 32 mg of ramp-o was used in our subsequent study.table  <dig> influence of ramp-o on composite milk scc

discussion
in this study, we demonstrated a therapeutic effect of oil emulsified polysaccharide fraction of atractylodis macrocephalae koidz.  on bovine subclinical mastitis. the use of immunomodulators to modulate bovine mammary gland has been previously reported. for example, it was found that intramammary administration of antibiotics in combination with recombinant bovine il- <dig> for staphylococcus aureus imis improved therapeutic efficacy by 20–30 %  <cit> . ginseng saponins  has been reported to stimulate lymphocyte proliferation and pmn phagocytosis from bovine peripheral blood and milk . recently, intramammary infusion of gs significantly increased il-1α, il-1β and tnf-α mrna expression in cows at drying off  <cit> . in the present study, the number of infected quarters was significantly reduced after ramp-o treatment. as ramp-o itself has no antibacterial activity, the diminished imis may be attributed to its immunomodulatory property.

ramp was extracted from the rhizome of atractylodis macrocephalae koidz. the drug is traditionally orally administered for the treatment of diarrhea and infections in humans and animals. zhou  <cit>  reported a successful treatment of chronic respiratory infections using shen ling bai zhu san  with an effective rate of 96 %. oral administration of the soup or ramp made from the rhizome has significantly enhanced the immune responses of mice to a model protein antigen ovalbumin or fmd vaccine  <cit> . in  <dig>  chai found an enhanced antibody response to ovalbumin by injection of ramp with the antigen. therefore, both oral and parental administrations of ramp can improve the immune response. chemical study has shown that ramp is composed of rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, glucose, and galactose with molar ratios of  <dig> :  <dig> :  <dig> :  <dig> :  <dig> :  <dig>   <cit> . in this study, we further analyzed the structure of ramp using ftir and 1h nmr spectra and the results indicated that it was a polysaccharide with both α- and β-configurations, while the main component was β-configuration. previous investigations have shown that many polysaccharides isolated from herbs possess biological activities . for example, the polysaccharides isolated from the root of astragalus membranaceus have a backbone structure composed of glucoses and have been widely used for their immunomodulatory activities  <cit> . ramp has been demonstrated to have the similar polysaccharide structure which may contribute to the therapeutic effect of ramp-o on bovine subclinical mastitis.

subcutaneous injection of ramp-o in the area of supramammary lymph node significantly reduced milk scc, nagase and imis in subclinically infected lactating cows.

mastitis is the most common disease of dairy cows. it is characterized by pathological alterations in the mammary tissues and compositional changes in the milk  <cit> . the economic losses caused by mastitis continue to bring heavy burden to dairy farm. although current practices have reduced its occurrence, the disease remains heavily prevalent in many dairy herds  <cit> . mastitis is mainly caused by invasion of bacteria in the mammary gland. when bacteria break through the physical barrier of teat canal, they encounter the second line of defense built by humoral and cellular protective factors of the mammary gland  <cit> . the humoral factors include immunoglobulin, complement, lactoferrin, lysozyme, lactoperoxidase system and so on while the cellular factors consist of macrophages, polymorphonuclear leukocytes , lymphocytes, etc.  <cit> . if the bacteria are virulent enough, they will settle in the mammary gland and establish the infection. the invading bacteria release chemotactic factors to attract large number of pmn flux into the mammary gland from blood stream, causing dramatically increased milk scc up to millions of cells per ml of milk. increased scc is frequently used as an indicator for the intramammary inflammation  <cit> . in this study, we showed that subcutaneous injection of ramp-o in the areas of supramammary lymph node in subclinically mastitic cows significantly reduced milk scc in both experiments  <dig> and  <dig> with the largest scope in decrease found in the cows injected with  <dig> or 48 mg of ramp-o. the decrease in milk scc may be attributed to diminished imis as less infected quarters were observed in cows treated with ramp-o than the control as demonstrated in experiment  <dig> 

nagase is an intracellular lysosomal enzyme which is released into milk from neutrophils during phagocytosis and cell lysis  <cit> . nagase is mostly located in pmn and thus freezing and thawing of the milk samples are used for a maximal release of the enzyme  <cit> . the enhanced phagocytes in the mammary gland is correlated with the increase of the enzyme. therefore, milk nagase is used as an indicator for imis. a successful antibiotic treatment could result in decrease of milk nagase activity  <cit> . in the present study, significantly decreased nagase  could be explained by reduced milk scc which could be due to declined imis following ramp-o treatment.

CONCLUSIONS
after observing the above results, we concluded that subcutaneous injection of ramp-o in the areas of supramammary lymph node had therapeutic value in the treatment of bovine subclinical mastitis by reducing scc, nagase and imis in milk. considering the therapeutic effect and the cost of ramp-o, 32 mg per dose was found most suitable to reduce milk scc and nagase. therefore, ramp-o needs further study for its use in treatment of bovine mastitis.
