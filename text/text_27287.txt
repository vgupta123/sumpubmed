BACKGROUND
microorganisms, because of their phenomenal biodiversity, are a rich natural resource of many biologically active compounds such as proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, pigments and polysaccharides  <cit> . metabolites produced by microorganisms often display high biological activities and their potential health benefits make them valuable ingredients in nutraceuticals, cosmetics and the food industry  <cit> . moreover, investigations related to the search for new bioactive compounds from industrially important microbial strains are of continued importance because of the high potential economic value of these metabolites  <cit> .

demand for carotenoid  pigments has been growing annually at a rate of  <dig> % and is a market predicted to reach at least us$  <dig>  billion in value by  <dig> as consumers continue to look for natural alternatives. among them, canthaxanthin  is used extensively in the food, fishery, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries  <cit> . d. natronolimnaea is one of the most important sources for the microbial production of cx from a commercial and industrial point of view  <cit> . to meet the growing demand of cx, a cost effective scaling-up of the industrial process is imperative  <cit> . in conventional methodology, nutritional factors and others necessary for growth of the microorganism are optimized by changing one at a time while keeping all others constant.  <cit> . this approach is the simplest to implement, and primarily helps in selection of significant parameters affecting the cx yield  <cit> . retrospective techniques are not only time restrictive, but also ignore any effects that interaction among various biophysical and nutritional parameters may have  <cit> . it is necessary to optimize the conditions for cx-producing mutant strains to explore their industrial potential.

optimization of microbial strains for the overproduction of industrial products has been the hallmark of all commercial bioderived production processes  <cit> . traditionally, improvement of bioactive compound yields in wild-type strains has been achieved through ultraviolet  mutagenesis, selection of naturally occurring mutants, or genetic recombination.

in recent years, the term irradiation technology has also been used to refer to novel techniques such as x-rays, ionizing irradiation, and heavy-ion irradiation. heavy-ion beam irradiation is a type of high linear energy transfer  irradiation that bombards the target with higher energy. such irradiation usually relies on different doses of irradiation to kill the vast majority of the bacterial cells  <cit> . following irradiation, the surviving microbes may often contain one or more mutations. for a very small percentage of the survivors the mutation may lead to an improved ability to produce a specific metabolite. irradiation of bacteria to produce mutant strains that result in the overproduction of primary or secondary metabolites is an intricate process. the successful development of d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig>  mutant strains for example requires knowledge of biophysics, microbiology, cell dynamics and physiology, optimization and control of process parameters, and the design of creative fermentation processes  <cit> .

the production of microbial cx is generally carried out through fermentation processes. such processes provide an excellent system for the large-scale production of carotenoids in general because of their ease of manipulation  <cit> . d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig>  strains have an advantage over other natural bioresources, as the fermentation process can be easily controlled to achieve higher growth rates and greater cell density without infringing on production constraints such as space and time. studies have shown that maximum production potential of a microbial species can be induced using a number of different approaches. these include supplementation of carotenoid stimulating factor to support enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathways, empirical optimization of environmental culture conditions through statistical experimental designs, use of stirrer fermenters to boost continuous production of cells in suspension, use of immobilized cell fermenters, screening and selection of optimal procedures for separation, purification, and membrane processing, and the preparation of mutants necessary for genetic engineering and gene expression techniques  <cit> .

detailed measurements of carotenoid and cx levels produced by d. natronolimnaea hs- <dig> mutants have previously been reported by gharibzahedi, s.m.t., et al.  <dig>  <cit> . the objective of this study therefore, was to apply a microdosimetric kinetic model with mg2+ as a trace element and carry out detailed measurements of cx produced by d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig>  strains using response surface methodology . this work focuses on the various influencing factors that may be employed to improve d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig>  strains and also addresses the complex problems of media optimization and the fine-tuning of process conditions. furthermore, this work aimed to explore emerging technologies and optimal media design for tracking mutants displaying enhanced production of microbial cx or other desirable attributes.

RESULTS
mathematical description of surviving fraction
d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig>  strains were irradiated by four energies:  <dig> mev u- <dig>   <dig> mev u- <dig>   <dig> mev u- <dig> and  <dig> mev u- <dig>  generated by a 12c6+ heavy ion accelerator. initial let beam energies of the 12c6+ ions were  <dig> kev μm- <dig>   <dig> kev μm- <dig>   <dig> kev μm- <dig> and  <dig> kev μm- <dig>  respectively. figure  <dig> shows survival curves of the strains with different energies and lets. the survival curves were fitted by a linear quadratic model, which for the four energies gave values of  <dig> ± <dig>  gy- <dig> and  <dig>  gy- <dig>   <dig> ± <dig>  gy- <dig> and  <dig>  gy- <dig>  and  <dig> ± <dig>  gy- <dig> and  <dig> ± <dig>  gy- <dig> respectively. the essential difference compared with equation  is, that the linear-quadratic approach allows for a finite initial slope to be calculated  <cit> . the different values correspond to curves obtained from the standard graph and use of equation   <cit> . these curves assume the effectiveness towards microdosimetry is completely described by the linear α-term in equation   <cit> . fitting two parameters to the limited survival data of these strains would cause large errors because of anticorrelation between α and β values  <cit> . for this reason only the α value was fitted with a constant β value. this is analogous to the microdosimetric kinetic model  used to calculate relative biological effectiveness  values. equation  is a general formula used in the local effect model  <cit> ; it does not rely on any particular representation of the photon dose response curve  <cit> . the formula can be applied even if only numerical values of s are available  <cit> . for practical reasons, however, a linear-quadratic approach for the low-let dose response curve is generally used  <cit> .

interpretation of the parameter fitting rbe/let dependencies in this study indicating an increased rbe is not unique for carbon ions of charged particle radiation. the rbe values derived from the survival curves support the known dependence of rbe on let, particle species and dose  <cit> . for 12c6+ ions, the transportation safety technologies -calculated rbe/let dependencies gradually increase with increasing let until they reach a maximum value, after which they slowly decrease  <cit> . the dependencies rely strongly on the particular physical characteristics of the ion beam determined for example by the energy and let of the particles under consideration  <cit> . this is demonstrated in figure  <dig> , where survival curves of d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig>  cells after irradiation with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> kev μm- <dig>  and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mev u- <dig>  12c6+ ions are compared. each survival curve has been constructed using a linear-quadratic model  <cit> . rbe decreases with increasing particle energy  <cit> , and the same increased ionization density should hold true for all cell types  <cit> . because the 12c6+ ions have a higher energy for any given let, lower energy density and thus lower rbe result. one must bear in mind, however, that high ionization densities will lead to more extensive damage that is more difficult to repair. cellular defects arising from damage repair may not necessarily translate into increased effectiveness because even simple damage is not always repairable by the cell  <cit> . survival data of the d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig>  cells were plotted using a logarithmic function of the surviving fraction versus dose. for comparison purposes the curves were represented mathematically, based on hypothetical models for the mechanisms associated with lethality. interpretation of the shape of the survival curve is still in question, as is the best way to mathematically present these types of data sets. the interpretation of the shape of the cell survival curve is still debated, as is the best way to fit these types of data mathematically. as already indicated in figure 1a-d, after reaching a maximum at  <dig> kev μm- <dig> surviving fraction not further increases, but instead decreases towards higher dose values. for the 12c6+ heavy ion irradiation  surviving fraction values as low as 1% are observed. the strain cells survival as a function of dose follows almost exponential behaviour, and thus survival curves are generally shown in figure 1a-d. the most prominent feature of most survival curves is thus the deviation from such a simple curve; namely, the dose response curve typically shows a shoulder . for the d. natronolimnaea strain cell types, survival curves start with a moderate slope, and with increasing energy and dose, the slope correspondingly increases. therefore, the efficiency per energy and dose increment increases as well. this can be understood in terms of the effectively of radiation induced mutations. at low energies and doses, only a few mutations are induced with a large spatial separation, and a considerable fraction of these mutations can be irradiated effectively. in contrast, at high energies and doses, the density of mutations increases, leading to an interaction of mutations and thus a reduced surviving fraction.

effect of different 12c6+ irradiation on cell growth
following irradiation, serial dilutions of the cell suspension to be tested were prepared. ten microliters of each dilution was inoculated into a 96-well plate containing  <dig> μl of the growth medium. for each dilution  <dig> replicates were prepared. plates were incubated at 27°c for  <dig> hours as previously described. the cell concentration was determined using the reed and muench method  <cit> . in each individual experiment, a cell culture was divided into aliquots and subjected to a predetermined set of irradiation doses, including no irradiation exposure. the aliquots were diluted in growth medium immediately after irradiation and plated in duplicate or triplicate  <cit> . for each experiment, the multiple platings of unirradiated  aliquots were counted and averaged to give the initial cell density in cfu ml- <dig>  this value represented 85–100% cell growth of the strain and was used as a base level comparison for all irradiated aliquots of the same culture. optical density  measurement at  <dig> nm was used to monitor cell growth. wherever necessary, samples were diluted to a final od value lower than  <dig>   <cit> . for all irradiation conditions examined, the concentrations of viable cells increased in an exponential fashion, followed by the typical stationary and death phases . microdosimetry using 12c6+ ions for the mutagenesis of d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig>  strains clearly shows an exponential decrease in the growth rate from 85% , to approximately 27%  . 113%  at lets , energies  and dose , to about 111%  at lets , energies  and dose , to about 97%  at lets , energies  and dose . interestingly, many survivors of the high-energy irradiation displayed a significant delay in growth and required extended incubation times to allow formation of measurable sized colonies. many of the low-energy survivors, however, displayed significant growth acceleration and therefore required shorter incubation times to form macroscopic colonies  <cit> . figure 2e–h shows the maximum growth rate  for  <dig> h obtained using irradiation parameters,  <dig> mev u- <dig> , 60– <dig> kev μm- <dig>  and  <dig> – <dig>  gy . figure 2m–p presents the minimum growth rate  for  <dig> h obtained using the irradiation parameters,  <dig> mev u- <dig> , 60– <dig> kev μm- <dig> , and  <dig> – <dig>  gy . these data suggest that the cellular growth rate of the d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig>  strain is dependent on the irradiation energy of the 12c6+ions. significant differences in the effects of 12c6+ ions at the same doses were also observed. this suggests a strong dependence of low-dose effects on let .

effect of irradiation dose on productivity of d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig> 
different irradiation doses showed a notable affect on the growth rate and conidia aggregation in d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig> . cx production in  <dig> l cultures of d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig>  mutants was, shown to be sensitive to irradiation dose . overall, for cx producing strains of d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig>  mutants, increasing the irradiation dose from the standard  <dig>  to  <dig>  gy led to a considerable decline in dry cell weight , from around  <dig>  ± <dig>  to  <dig>  ± <dig>  g l- <dig>  respectively. the cx yield, however, showed an almost two-fold increase from  <dig> ± <dig>  to  <dig> ± <dig>  mg l- <dig>  to find the optimal 12c6+ irradiation dose for the process, a considerable amount of cell culture was carried out using similar irradiation experiments. figure 3a shows that up to a dose of  <dig>  gy irradiation, the d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig>  strains productivity increases by almost six-fold. optimal production of  <dig>  mg l- <dig> h- <dig> was detected at a irradiation dose of approximately  <dig>  gy at an  <dig> kev μm- <dig> let and  <dig> mev u- <dig> energy level . in contrast, 12c6+ irradiation with a let of more than  <dig> kev μm- <dig>  and energy level of greater than  <dig> mev u- <dig> reduced the rate of production . 12c6+ irradiation with let , energy  and dose  led to perfect mycelial growth . the increased irradiation dose of 12c6+ however led to a decrease in biomass in this strain . figure 3b depicts the bdw and productivity of the strains with respect to different energy  versus an irradiation dose with a let of  <dig> kev μm- <dig>  productivity increased with increasing irradiation dose and energy up to  <dig>  gy and  <dig> mev u- <dig> respectively. the specific productivity decreased at radiation doses less than  <dig>  gy. in contrast, the bdw yield decreased with increasing irradiation dose and energy up to  <dig>  gy and  <dig> mev u- <dig> respectively. figure 3d depicts the bdw and productivity of the strains with respect to different energy  versus an irradiation dose at a let of  <dig> kev μm- <dig>  as the radiation dose  and energy  increased, the bdw yields decreased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  g l- <dig>  however, the maximum specific productivity was measured at just  <dig>  mg l- <dig> h- <dig>  further increases in radiation doses resulted in decreased bdw and specific productivity. the wild type strain of d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig>  was used in this study to substantiate the findings made with irradiated strains. just  <dig> cell cultures using wild type strains were carried out. this resulted in the wild type strains displaying a higher standard deviation  compared with the standard deviation of the  <dig> irradiated strains. throughout the study, it was observed that the bdw declined concomitantly with increasing bacterial specific productivity. the bdw dropped to its minimum when microorganism specific productivity peaked. from our findings it is evident that irradiation doses  greater than  <dig>  gy can both damage cells and/or change cell morphology, which leads to reduced cx yields. the optimal let, energy and irradiation dose for the non-lethal induction of point mutations by 12c6+ ions  are also ideal for maximising cx specific productivity in d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig> .

statistical evaluation and optimization of factors affecting productivity by rsm
canthaxanthin production is generally carried out through fermentation processes  <cit> . because of their ease of manipulation microorganisms provide an excellent system that facilitates large-scale production of cx. optimization of conditions favouring cx production in irradiated strains is necessary to explore their industrial possibilities  <cit> . this can be achieved through rsm, a type of modelling used to study the effects of simultaneous variation of several factors  <cit> . rsm studies help to determine the accurate optimum values of test variables on the basis of a limited number of experiments  <cit> . carbon source was examined in a supplemented basal medium containing, d-glucose, maltose, mannose, lactose, galactose and glycerol. preliminary investigations demonstrated that d-glucose and mannose were significant carbon sources for production of cx . trace elements such as cu2+, fe3+, zn2+ mn2+ and mg2+ act as cofactors for several enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of carotenoids, and at certain concentrations, can improve metabolite production  <cit> . in addition, it has been reported that supplementation of the growth medium with various ions  improved carotenoid production by various yeast strains including rhodotorula glutinis <cit> . it has also been reported that the rate of carotenogenesis in the fungus blakeslea trispora was significantly elevated in the presence of fe3+, mg2+ and cu2+ ions. a preliminary investigation demonstrated that divalent ions including mg2+, boron, cobalt, iron, manganese, molybdenum, selenium and vanadium had the highest effect on cx biosynthesis in d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig>  mutants . rsm was used to evaluate the effect of four variables on the growth and cx production of d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig>  12c6+ irradiation mutants. these were d-glucose content , mg2+ concentration , mannose content  and irradiation dose . where sqrt is equal to cx production, the model incorporating the four variables  is as follows:

  sqrt=ϖ0+ϖ1a+ϖ2b+ϖ3c+ϖ4d+ϖ11a2+ϖ22b2+ϖ33c2+ϖ44d2+ϖ12ab+ϖ13ac+ϖ14ad+ϖ23bc+ϖ24bd+ϖ34cd 

based on central composite design ,  <dig> treatments, each at three different levels  were carried out. experiments were randomized to minimize the effects of unexplained variability in the observed responses due to extraneous factors  <cit> . these preliminary studies showed that upon addition of the four growth factors  to the culture medium, desirable amounts of bdw and cx were produced by the mutant strain .

the statistical significance of the model equation  was determined by fishers test value. the degree of variance illustrated by the model is given by the r squared value  <cit> . the statistical treatment combinations of the process parameters along with the bdw concentrations  and cx production  as response variables are listed in table  <dig>  the regression equation was assessed statistically by anova, the results of which are presented in table  <dig>  analysis of variance showed a high degree of significance for cx yield, which is also evident from the fisher f test , which gave a very low p value in both cases.

the f- value of  <dig>  in table  <dig> implies that the model is significant. there is only  <dig> % chance that a “model f-value” so large could occur due to noise. anova indicated that the linear model terms, d-glucose content , mg2+ concentration , mannose content , dose , and the quadratic terms, d-glucose a <dig> , mg2+ concentration b <dig> , mannose content c <dig> , dose d <dig>  and four interaction terms were significant. anova was used to analyze the responses under different combinations as defined by the design . the application of rsm gave rise to the regression equation  for cx production. the quadratic equation specifies an empirical relationship between cx yield and the test variables.

  sqrt= <dig> + <dig> a+ <dig> b+ <dig> c+ <dig> d− <dig> a2− <dig> b2− <dig> c2− <dig> d2− <dig> ab+ <dig> ac− <dig> ad+ <dig> bc+ <dig> bd+ <dig> cd 

the anova regression model demonstrated an adjusted coefficient of determination  of  <dig> , indicating  <dig> % variability in the response could be explained by this model. a very low value of coefficient of variation  indicates better precision and reliability of the executed experiments. an acceptable precision value of  <dig>  was obtained as a measure of the signal-to-noise ratio, with a ratio > <dig>  deemed desirable  <cit> . in this case, higher ratio indicates an adequate signal, and also proves that model can be used to navigate the design space  <cit> .

table  <dig> shows the linear effects of d-glucose content and mg2+ concentration were significant  on the cx produced by d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig>  mutants, whereas mannose content was significant. the quadratic effects of mannose content and mg2+ concentration were significant at the  <dig> % level. in table  <dig> depicts an interaction between d-glucose and mannose content was not significant. these observations were also substantiated by a highly significant  interactive effect between the variables on biomass production. the 3d response surface plots and two dimensional contour plots were used to understand the interaction effects of medium components and optimum concentration of each component required for maximum cx production. in each set, two variables varied within their experimental range, while the other two variables remained constant at zero level. this reveals that variation in the cx value could be explained as a nonlinear function of the d-glucose and mannose content. the most significant  effect on cx was shown to be the linear effect of mg2+ concentration, followed by the linear effect of d-glucose content and the quadratic effect of mg2+ concentration, as presented in table  <dig>  the concentration of mg2+ can therefore significantly influence the production and accumulation of biomass  <cit> . mg2+ acts as a stimulant by affecting the growth and activity of the microorganism, which in turn leads to a significant improvement in microbial biomass and production of cx  <cit> . figure 4a shows the response surface contour plot and 3d plots for the interactive effect of d-glucose and mannose on cx production. it was observed that mutants of d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig>  grown in d-glucose medium and supplemented with  <dig>  g l- <dig> mannose showed an increase in cx . however, cx concentration significantly decreased upon further increases in mannose content. this was likely due to inhibition facilitated by sugar concentrations higher than  <dig>  g l- <dig> <cit> . the results suggest that a culture medium containing  <dig>  g l- <dig> d-glucose,  <dig>  g l- <dig> mannose and  <dig>  ppm mg2+ is optimal for obtaining maximum cx production.

response surface contour and 3d plots were employed to determine the interaction of the independent variables and the optimum levels that have the most significant effect on cx production . table  <dig> indicates the quadratic effects of irradiation dose and mannose content significantly  influenced the production of cx. moreover, the interaction between irradiation dose and d-glucose concentration was significant . among the four interaction parameters studied, irradiation dose was the most significant factor to affect the cx obtained from d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig>  mutants. this was followed by the linear effect of d-glucose content and the quadratic effect of mannose content, according to the significance of the regression coefficients in the quadratic polynomial model  and slope of the 3d response surface plot . figure 4b shows that high d-glucose and mg2+concentrations were responsible for the high cx value. the interaction response of d-glucose with mg2+ resulted in an increasing cx yield with increasing d-glucose and mg2+ concentrations up to  <dig>  g l- <dig> and  <dig> ppm, respectively. the cx production increased when mg2+ concentrations > <dig>  ppm. the optimal values for d-glucose content and mg2+concentration were  <dig>  g l-1and  <dig>  ppm, respectively. figure 4c illustrates the interactive effect of d-glucose content  and irradiation dose  on cx production. it was observed that a combination of both irradiation dose and d-glucose content was solely responsible for achieving a relatively high cx yield of  <dig>  mg l- <dig> as predicted by the model. cx production in the bacterial strain, d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig>  could therefore theoretically be increased  <dig>  fold from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg l- <dig>  using mutagenesis. to our knowledge, the maximum cx production by d. natronolimnaea strains without the use of cofactors and mutagenic processes was reported at  <dig>  mg l- <dig>  <cit> . the mutant d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig>  strain obtained from 12c6+ mutagenesis in the presence of a radiation dose of  <dig> – <dig>  gy therefore exhibited  <dig> % more cx production than the wild type. in comparison, the mutagenesis work of gharibzahedi et al. on the same bacterium reported cx production of  <dig>  mg l- <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
microdosimetry using a 12c6+ heavy ion irradiation model used parametric models for determination of the optimal doses required for the non-lethal induction of mutations . statistical evaluation and response surface methodologies were used to model optimization of cx production from the mutant strain of d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig> . ccd was a key tool for optimizing the components of the nutrient medium. the model was successfully demonstrated by raising the productivity of the mutant d. natronolimnaea svgcc <dig>  strain. a  <dig> % increase in cx production was evident when nutritional factors  and irradiation doses  were optimized. at the very least, 12c6+ random mutagenesis can be used as a first step in a combined approach with continuous fermentation processes. we believe that the data obtained from this work are valuable and should be developed further.
