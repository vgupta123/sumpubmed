BACKGROUND
the dynamic process of gene regulation is essential for embryonic development and cellular function. gene regulation is primarily mediated by the combinatorial effects of transcription factors interacting with cis-regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers. therefore, accurate identification of transcription factor binding sites within the genome is necessary to understand a wide range of cellular processes from cell differentiation to homeostasis to cancer. however, identifying these sites within the genome remains a complex biological and computational question.

one of the challenges in predicting transcription factor binding sites is that identification of the strongest binding sequence, or consensus site, is not sufficient. research analyzing genome wide transcription factor occupancy has shown that low affinity binding sites are also significantly occupied in both yeast and drosophila  <cit> . furthermore, transcription factors from the same family have been shown to bind identical high affinity sites, but distinct low affinity sites  <cit> . therefore, identification of both high and low affinity sites will be essential to fully understand transcription factor specificity within the genome.

current transcription factor motif algorithms generally rely on a statistical model, such as a position weight matrix , generated with information derived from homology between co-regulated promoters, conserved regions in orthologous genes, known binding sites, or in vitro binding assays  <cit> . however, these methods have a low level of specificity and sensitivity  <cit> . this problem is due to both experimental and theoretical errors. experimental errors include alignment of a limited set of binding sites  <cit> , resulting in a pwm that is information poor, and non-physiological conditions used in in vitro binding assays  <cit> . theoretical errors stem from assumptions used as the basis of the pwm model. pwms assume that contributions by individual bases within a binding site are independent and additive, and that the binding energy contribution is proportional to their frequency in the position weight matrix. however, all three of these assumptions have been called into question. interdependencies have been demonstrated at least in a subset of transcription factors resulting in contributions to binding affinity that are both interdependent and non-additive  <cit> . position weight matrix scores have also been experimentally shown to be a poor predictor of binding affinities in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems  <cit> .

nkx <dig>  is a homeodomain transcription factor expressed in the ventral neural tube, intestine and pancreas  <cit> . a consensus sequence aagttt) has been identified by selex and a corresponding pwm was generated and deposited in the transfac database  <cit> . however, experiences in our lab and others have shown that the predictive power of this pwm is low. more recently, berger et al.  <cit>  generated a pwm for nkx <dig>  using protein binding microarray  technology. pbms use a mathematically constructed set of oligos to quantitatively measure protein-dna binding for all possible octamers. this should, in theory, result in a pwm that is more information rich than those constructed by other methods.

here, we show the results of an in-depth analysis of the pbm data for nkx <dig> . the original nkx <dig>  consensus sequence contains an invariable "aagt" core. we have identified an alternative low-affinity core sequence with a wobble in the first position to contain "gagt". we also mapped the pbm data directly to the genome to identify putative nkx <dig>  binding sites. using this method, we identified  <dig> novel nkx <dig>  binding sites within the proximal promoters of genes differentially expressed in wildtype and nkx <dig>  null pancreata and confirmed approximately 90% of these sites by emsa and/or chip analysis. six of the sites confirmed by emsa and chip contain the alternative "gagt" core sequence. we also show that using a moving average of e-scores from the protein binding microarrays to predict relative binding affinity outperformed both the transfac pwm and the pbm-based pwm. since the pbm-based pwm and the method described in this study rely on the same input data, these results show that the assumptions used to generate pwms do not accurately describe nkx <dig>  binding. therefore, creating genome-wide maps by directly using experimental data will greatly increase the specificity and sensitivity of transcription factor binding site  predictions over statistical models. furthermore, these experiments revealed a gene battery that includes a large number of genes required for insulin secretion functions in the β-cell that is controlled by nkx <dig> . we demonstrate that this same method can be adapted to other transcription factors. based on these findings, we propose that pbm-mapping can be used to create composite tfbs maps across the entire genome. such a map would greatly aid in the identification of cis-regulatory elements and the understanding of gene regulation.

RESULTS
identification of an alternative nkx <dig>  binding site core sequence
nkx <dig>  was previously shown to specifically bind a  <dig> base-pair sequence containing an invariable "aagt" core sequence flanked by several less conserved bases  <cit> . to date, only two in vivo binding sites  identified using this sequence have been successfully verified  <cit> . one possible explanation for the low predictive power of this consensus sequence is that it does not completely encompass the possible binding motifs for nkx <dig>  binding. more recently, berger et al.  <cit>  published a protein binding microarray  analyzing the binding affinity of the nkx <dig>  homeodomain. pbms generate an enrichment score  with a range from - <dig>   to  <dig>   for every possible 8-base combination based on the relative intensity readouts from microarray data  <cit> . therefore, it has the potential to be more information rich than other methods because it allows for complete coverage of possible binding sequences and provides quantitative binding results. we used this data as a basis to identify additional nkx <dig>  dna binding motifs.

we first selected and analyzed all nkx <dig> -bound octamers with an e-score greater than  <dig>  . of these,  <dig>  contained the previously published "aagt" core sequence or its reverse complement. of the remaining  <dig> octamers,  <dig>  had an alternative sequence "gagt." three octamers did not contain either core sequence. we next calculated the average e-score for octamers containing aagt and octamers containing gagt. the average of all possible octamers was used as a baseline control. aagt and gagt containing octamers had a mean e-score value of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, which are significantly greater  than the mean for all possible octamers .

several combinations of two core sequences are possible within a single octamer. in order to identify the effect of two adjacent cores on nkx <dig>  binding, we analyzed these "dual-core" octamers . dual-core octamers for nkx <dig>  binding can be divided into  <dig> groups based on which core sequence  is included and their relative orientation . interestingly, all octamers containing two cores in the reverse compliment orientation had e-scores >  <dig>  while octamers with inline cores had e-scores <  <dig> , independent of which cores were contained in the octamer.

the two identified core sequence motifs differ only in the first position. in order to determine whether significant enrichment could be achieved with the other two possible first position bases, we plotted a histogram of the number of occurrences of each possible base in the first position for all e-scores . we found that there is a significant enrichment of only the aagt and gagt core sequences.

to experimentally test the alternative gagt binding site, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay  experiments using the previously published nkx <dig>  consensus sequence as a baseline probe  <cit>  . we mutated this probe to contain the alternative gagt core sequence  and compared binding to both the original consensus probe  and a probe with a deleted core sequence . the gagt containing probe showed significant binding with in vitro translated nkx <dig>   or nuclear extract from pancreatic cell lines with or without exogenously expressed nkx <dig> , although binding was weaker than the aagt containing probe. taken together, these experiments show that gagt represents an alternative core sequence for nkx <dig>  binding sites, although its relative binding affinity is lower than the canonical aagt core sequence.

identification of novel endogenous nkx <dig>  binding sites using protein binding microarray mapping
several methods to predict genomic transcription factor binding sites using pbm data have been developed. the most common methods rely on pwm creation by the "seed-and-wobble" algorithm or parametric methods  <cit> . however, these methods are limited by the inaccuracies of the pwm model. e-scores of single octamers have also been suggested to be correlated with transcription factor binding affinity, suggesting that they might be able to be directly used to predict binding sites  <cit> . however, the dataset of e-scores has been shown to be somewhat noisy  <cit> . in order to compensate for dataset noise, grove et al.  <cit>  used an average of  <dig> e-scores based on a perfectly conserved core sequence . however, we show in this study that the core sequence may not be completely conserved. therefore, we sought to develop a novel algorithm that utilizes a moving average of e-scores for overlapping octamers to predict endogenous nkx <dig>  binding sites without the bias for pwm-derived consensus core sequences and with more overlapping octamers than were used in the avges method . we refer to this method as pbm-mapping. briefly, e-scores are mapped to each octamer in the genome and a moving average of several overlapping octamers is calculated. we experimentally determined that using a moving average of  <dig> octamers predicted binding affinity with the greatest accuracy . sequences with a moving average higher than a determined threshold are then deposited into a database that can be queried to identify putative sites. we show by dna binding assays that the threshold should be set to approximately  <dig>  for nkx <dig> , although this threshold may vary for other transcription factors .

we tested our algorithm by searching for nkx <dig>  binding sites throughout the genome. complete analysis of the genome resulted in  <dig> ×  <dig> predicted sites, which falls within range of the expected number of binding sites in the genome for a single transcription factor, based on statistical probability of the sequence occurring in the genome. in order to investigate sites that are most likely to be biologically relevant, we selected sites within regulatory regions from  <dig>  kb upstream to  <dig> kb downstream of the transcription start site of  <dig> genes with expression levels significantly  changed in nkx <dig>  null embryos  <cit> . a total  <dig> putative binding sites were identified in  <dig> differentially expressed genes including  <dig> of the  <dig> genes with increased expression in the nkx <dig>  null pancreas, and  <dig> of the  <dig> genes with decreased expression in the nkx <dig>  null pancreas. furthermore, genes with differential expression in the nkx <dig>  null embryo were more likely to have predicted sites within  <dig> bp upstream of the transcriptional start site .

we chose to test the binding of  <dig> putative sites that were randomly selected from the promoters of differentially expressed genes using emsa analysis . we also included  <dig> predicted sites that were located outside of the designated promoter region because they fell in genes of particular interest, including a site in the recently described region iv enhancer of the pdx <dig> promoter  <cit>  and additional sites in the promoter regions of irs <dig>  and nkx <dig>  . in addition, we tested a previously published nkx <dig>  binding site in the insulin <dig> promoter  that is the only previously published nkx <dig>  site not predicted by pbm-mapping  <cit> . the published nkx <dig>  site in the mafa promoter  was used as a positive control  <cit> . of the  <dig> sites tested by emsa, only the ins <dig> - <dig>  the nkx <dig>  + <dig>  and the glucagon - <dig> sites did not show detectable binding. consistently, the gcg - <dig> and nkx <dig>  + <dig> sites had averages e-score of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, and represented the lowest scores of any predicted site tested. the ins <dig> - <dig> site was below our original threshold with an average e-score of  <dig> .

although emsa analysis shows the sequence specificity of transcription factor binding, it does not take into account cell-specific chromatin states or cooperative factors that may affect binding in vivo. in order to confirm nkx <dig>  occupancy of these sites in β-cells, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation  using the βtc <dig> cell line . we did not include the nkx <dig>  - <dig>  nkx <dig>  + <dig>  irs <dig> + <dig> and tm4sf <dig> + <dig> sites in this analysis because they fell in low complexity regions, which hindered the design of appropriate primers. precipitation with the nkx <dig>  monoclonal antibody resulted in significant enrichment of all predicted promoters that were tested . the promoter for the housekeeping gene gapdh was used as a negative control. this data shows that promoters containing predicted sites are occupied in vivo. however, chip results cannot distinguish between multiple sites in of the gcg, ins <dig>  iapp, nkx <dig> , and tm4sf <dig> promoters due to the close proximity of the sites.

pbm-mapping accurately predicts relative nkx <dig>  binding affinity in vitro
transcription factor binding in vivo is not a binary event but a continuum of site occupancy proportional to the binding affinity  of the transcription factor and its binding site. therefore, the ideal tfbs prediction algorithm would generate a score that is highly correlated with transcription factor binding affinity. it has been proposed that the e-score from pbm experiments is indicative of relative binding affinity and preliminary experiments have shown correlation between individual octamer e-scores and binding affinity  <cit> . therefore, in order to test whether single octamer and average e-scores are correlated with relative nkx <dig>  binding affinity, we quantified the fraction bound for each site in the emsa analysis  and graphed it against single e-scores for the highest octamer and averages of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> oligos . the fractional occupancy of a transcription factor bound to a dna binding site is indicative of the relative binding affinities of the ligands  <cit> . the average of  <dig> overlapping scores showed the highest correlation with relative binding affinity  and outperformed both the transfac pwm score  and the pbm seed and wobble matrix score  . in order to confirm the correlation between the pbm-mapping score and biochemically-derived binding affinity values, we analyzed  <dig> binding-sites with kd values that were determined for the nkx <dig>  drosophila homolog, vnd  <cit> . the homeodomains of the fly and mouse proteins contain 95% amino acid identity and greater than 98% similarity, therefore the kd values for nkx <dig>  and vnd should also be very similar. regression analysis of pbm-mapping scores against the kd values for  <dig> vnd sites showed strong correlation . taken together, these experiments show that pbm-mapping represents a highly accurate prediction method to find genome wide binding sites.

aagt and gagt core sequences contribute to nkx <dig>  binding in the neurod <dig> promoter
although there is overlap between pwm based predictions and pbm mapping, the predictions are significantly different for sites within the neurod <dig> gene, which have previously been shown to be directly regulated by nkx <dig>   <cit> . in the neurod <dig> promoter, previous analysis for nkx <dig>  binding predicted two sites that could not be confirmed by emsa analysis  <cit> . pbm-mapping did not predict either of these sites, but predicted a novel site at - <dig> that was bound in emsa experiments . the pbm-mapping predicted nkx <dig>  site within the neurod <dig> promoter is unique because it is predicted to consist of two adjacent nkx <dig>  binding sites . one binding site contains the previously published "aagt" core sequence while the other has the novel "gagt" core sequence identified in this study. mutation of each individual core sequence showed a reduction in binding while mutation of both cores simultaneously was necessary to completely ablate nkx <dig>  binding , suggesting that both cores contribute to nkx <dig>  binding. interestingly, we did not detect a slower migrating protein complex forming on the double site, suggesting that dimer formation is prevented, possibly by steric hindrance. this may represent a unique mechanism to increase transcription factor occupancy on the promoter.

identification of a novel nkx <dig>  binding site in the insulin promoter
an nkx <dig>  binding site in the insulin promoter  was previously identified  <cit> . this site is predicted by the transfac pwm and the pbm seed and wobble matrix, but is not predicted by pbm-mapping . we were unable to confirm nkx <dig>  binding to the previously published site by in vitro generated nkx <dig>  . however, pbm mapping predicted a site  <dig> bases upstream of the previously published site that was confirmed by emsa . chip analysis showed nkx <dig>  occupancy with primers for both the published and the newly predicted site, although occupancy appeared to be stronger on the pbm-mapping predicted site . although the chip results are unable to completely distinguish between occupancy of both sites because of their close proximity relative to the dna fragmentation size, it is also possible that nkx <dig>  binds the ins <dig> - <dig> site through cooperative binding with cofactors that would not have been detected by emsa analysis using in vitro translated nkx <dig> . therefore, we performed additional emsa analysis using βtc <dig> nuclear extract . a strong shift was observed when βtc <dig> nuclear extract was incubated with the ins <dig> - <dig> probe and this shift was inhibited by addition of nkx <dig>  antibody . a weaker nkx <dig>  containing complex could also be detected bound to the ins <dig> - <dig> site . therefore, it appears that nkx <dig>  may be stabilized on the ins <dig> - <dig> site by interacting factors, although this interaction appears to be much weaker than the - <dig> site identified by pbm-mapping.

pbm-mapping accurately predicts hnf4α binding sites
to test the wider applicability of pbm-mapping for the general prediction of transcription factor direct targets, we applied a moving average of e-scores from  <dig> overlapping octamers to the nuclear receptor family member hnf4α. hnf4α has been shown to bind dna as a homodimer to a site containing two direct repeats of the consensus binding site   <cit> . therefore, hnf4α represents a transcription factor that is structurally and functionally distinct from nkx <dig> . we applied pbm-mapping to  <dig> putative hnf4α binding sites  that were previously tested by emsa analysis  <cit> . at a threshold value of  <dig> , pbm-mapping predicted  <dig> of the  <dig>  confirmed binding sites and correctly did not predict any of the negative sites . adding or subtracting the number of overlapping octamers did not improve prediction scores for the analyzed data set . this data suggests that pbm-mapping may be directly applicable to a wide range of transcription factors.

discussion
the identification of transcription factor binding sites is an important biological question. to date, the majority of methods to detect these sites have focused on creating statistical models, such as position weight matrices, of transcription factor specificities. however, these models are limited due to the fact that they must make generalized assumptions about transcription factor binding properties that are not completely understood. other recent technologies have been developed such as chip-seq to look at genomic transcription factor occupancy  <cit> . however, these technologies do not identify the precise binding sites, are technically difficult, and limited by the lack of high quality antibodies for many transcription factors. therefore, bioinformatic prediction of transcription factor binding sites remains a powerful and useful tool for understanding transcriptional regulation. in this paper, we propose a modified technique for creating genome-wide tfbs site maps using direct mapping of protein binding microarray data . this method is technically simpler than chip-seq methods and does not rely on the assumptions used in statistical models.

we have shown that pbm-mapping more accurately predicts relative binding affinity than previously reported transfac or pbm based pwms. pwm inaccuracies have been attributed to both experimental and theoretical errors  <cit> . our studies support both of these limitations. the transfac pwm was developed from the alignment of  <dig> sequences enriched using selex experiments. the pbm-pwm was based on microarray experiments, which provide data for all possible octamers. in our experiments, the pbm-pwm was more highly correlated with observed relative binding affinity than the transfac pwm, most likely due to the increased information content in the pbm-pwm. however, pbm-mapping scores correlated to a greater extent with relative binding affinity than either pwm method, even though it was generated from the same data used for the pbm-pwm. therefore, the pwm statistical model does not accurately model nkx <dig>  binding.

numerous methods for generating pwms exist and there are several statistical corrections that can be applied to the pwm model, however accurately testing and comparing all of these corrections is technically difficult and therefore were outside the scope of this study  <cit> . predictions based on the combined results of more than one pwm could also be attempted. however, these predictions would still be susceptible to the limitations of the pwm model to account for the influence of neighboring nucleotides and flanking regions.

a method for using the average e-score of  <dig> overlapping octamers surrounding a previously identified core sequence  has been utilized for predicting binding sites in c. elegans  <cit> . however, this method was not fully tested for accuracy and is biased by the assumption of a completely conserved 4-basepair long core sequence. our results show that using an average e-score from an increased number of overlapping octamers improved the accuracy of transcription factor binding site prediction. interestingly, an average e-score of  <dig> overlapping octamers resulted in the highest correlation with relative binding affinity. this represents the greatest number of overlapping octamers possible with at least one base pair common between all oligos. nkx <dig>  binding has been reported to be influenced by the flanking dna sequence  <cit> . therefore, the increase in accuracy is most likely due to accounting for the flanking regions; however, it may also be due to reductions in the inherent noise present from microarray quantification  <cit> . it remains possible that bases outside of the  <dig> octamer window can affect binding affinity, although using a window larger than  <dig> overlapping octamers resulted in decreased accuracy. this may be due to limitations of using  <dig> bp long motifs for generation of pbm data. it remains to be seen if increasing the length of dna-binding sequences used in the microarray based experiments to generate e-scores would further increase the accuracy of binding affinity prediction.

we did not observe a large difference between the flanking regions of "aagt" and "gagt" containing sequences. furthermore, both core sequences share common flanking regions in the octamers with the highest e-score . however, the magnitude of the effect that base substitutions in the flanking regions have of the overall score of the site differed between "aagt" and "gagt" containing sites. for example, conversion of "g" to "c" in the last position of the above mentioned octamers reduces the single octamer e-score of the "aagt" site by  <dig>  and the "gagt" site by  <dig> , confirming that the bases in these positions are not independently additive, but are dependent on other bases in the binding site, even when these bases are not immediately adjacent.

we tested pbm-mapping using the homeodomain transcription factor nkx <dig> . nkx <dig>  has been shown to act as both an activator and a repressor during pancreatic islet formation  <cit> . β-cells are completely absent in the nkx <dig>  null embryo  <cit> . there was also a corresponding decrease in many, but not all, β-cell markers  <cit> . however, it was unclear which of these genes were down-regulated due to direct transcriptional control by nkx <dig>  or because the β-cell population was absent. we used pbm-mapping to predict novel nkx <dig>  binding sites within bound promoters of genes differentially expressed between wildtype and nkx <dig>  null embryos. interestingly, a large majority of differentially expressed genes had predicted sites, suggesting that between e <dig>  and e <dig>  the changes seen in the nkx <dig>  null pancreas are largely due to direct regulation by nkx <dig>  and not a cascade of downstream transcription factors. we were also able to predict binding sites in several β-cell specific genes, including a battery of genes encoding proteins present in secretory vesicles, such as insulin, iapp and chgb that appear to be coordinately activated by nkx <dig> .

several studies have shown that relatively weak or secondary binding sites are biologically important  <cit> . these sites may create genomic binding profiles dependent on protein concentrations or they may differentially bind closely related transcription factors that share a common primary binding motif  <cit> . careful analysis of the pbm data for nkx <dig>  revealed a previously unidentified alternative "gagt" binding site motif for nkx <dig> . gagt containing sites were also represented in our predicted sites --confirming the ability of the algorithm to predict secondary sites. this is the first secondary motif that has been identified for an nkx <dig> family member, although a unique secondary motif has been identified for nkx <dig>   <cit> . pbm-mapping does not predict that nkx <dig>  binds the gtac core sequence; however this is not surprising since the homeodomain sequences between nkx <dig> and nkx <dig> family members are not well conserved and the two protein families are known to preferentially bind different core sequences  <cit> . further research is necessary to determine whether the gagt motif identified in this study is unique to nkx <dig>  or is shared among several nkx <dig> genes.

the importance of weak or secondary binding sites highlights the importance of finding a suitable threshold for determining positive prediction results. in our study, we set the threshold for putative nkx <dig>  binding sites at  <dig>  based on the results from our emsa analysis. however, this may not accurately reflect in vivo binding. for example, the gcg - <dig> site, which had an average e-score just below our threshold, did not show binding in emsa analysis , but appeared to be occupied in chip . therefore, it is possible that our threshold is overly stringent or that nkx <dig>  binding to weak sites is dependent on the presence of cofactors. the appropriate threshold may also vary between cell types due to different expression levels of the transcription factor. furthermore, our results show that the appropriate threshold for different transcription factors will differ.

CONCLUSIONS
although our studies to test pbm-mapping mainly focused on nkx <dig> , we believe that it could be widely applied to other transcription factor binding sites. homeodomain proteins generally bind to a motif with a strong 4- <dig> base pair core with less conserved flanking sequences  <cit> ; therefore, the pbm-mapping algorithm should be directly applicable to most homeodomain containing proteins. we also show that pbm-mapping can be applied to the nuclear receptor protein hnf4α, but with a different threshold score and number of overlapping octamers than nkx <dig> . not surprisingly, this suggests that the different dna-binding site profiles associated with each class of protein will necessitate modifying the number of overlapping octamers used in each analysis. this will especially apply to transcription factor classes that contain shorter or longer binding sites. for example, several zinc finger proteins are thought to have binding sites that contains a 3-base pair core, while some bhlh factors have a  <dig> bp core sequence  <cit> . a shorter core sequence may rely more heavily on flanking sequences for binding specificity, which would require increased octamer coverage, whereas a longer core may be more self-contained and require fewer octamers for predictive coverage. threshold values may also need to be adjusted for each protein analyzed. therefore, adapting this method to other transcription factor families may require a training set of known binding sites to determine an appropriate threshold for each transcription factor. if previously identified binding sites are not available, a training set can be generated from a subset of pbm-mapping predicted sites that span a wide range of pbm-mapping scores, as was done in this study. although small adaptations may be necessary, the application of this method to other transcription factors merits further investigation.
