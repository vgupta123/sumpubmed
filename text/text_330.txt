BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome  is considered to be one of the most significant viral diseases, causing serious economic losses to the swine industry worldwide  <cit> . the etiological agent, prrs virus , is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense rna virus, which is a member of the family arteriviridae including equine arteritis virus , lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus , and simian hemorrhagic fever virus   <cit> . the viral genome is approximately 15 kb in length and contains at least nine open reading frames   <cit> . the nonstructural proteins  are encoded in orf1a and orf1b, which are situated in the 5’-proximal two-thirds of the genome. some of these nsps and host cellular factors are assembled into the double membrane vesicles  derived from endoplasmic reticulum  to form the viral replication and transcription complex  for viral replication, subgenomic  mrna transcription, and translation  <cit> . the membrane-enclosed structure in which the viral rna synthesis takes place likely provides a stable and confined environment for replication and also protects viral rna genome from being recognized by host response proteins  <cit> .

exposure of cells and tissues to extreme conditions such as heat, oxidative and osmotic stress, heavy metals, uv irradiation, microbial and viral infection leads to selective transcription and translation of heat shock proteins   <cit> . hsps are highly conserved and ubiquitous cytoprotective proteins, many of which are chaperone molecules that facilitate protein folding, trafficking and also prevent their aggregation and degradation  <cit> . based on their molecular weight, hsps are divided into different classes: hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and small hsps  <cit> . as a central component of the cellular chaperone network, hsp <dig> is frequently recruited by numerous viruses  <cit> . hsp <dig> can be involved in different stages of the viral life cycle, including entry  <cit> , uncoating  <cit> , replication of the viral genome  <cit> , gene expression  <cit>  and virion morphogenesis  <cit> . evidence is growing that hsp <dig> is associated with the formation of viral rtc and regulates the replication of many viruses, such as hepatitis c virus  <cit> , flock house virus  <cit> , herpes simplex virus type  <dig>  <cit> , tomato bushy stunt tombusvirus  <cit> . however, the function of hsp <dig> during prrsv infection has not been investigated.

we have previously shown that transcript abundance of hsp <dig> is elevated in prrsv infected lungs relative to uninfected negative control  lungs  <cit> , suggesting hsp <dig> may play a potential role in prrsv infection. in this study, we aimed to investigate the role of hsp <dig> during prrsv infection. our results showed that hsp <dig> is up-regulated in prrsv-infected cells. the quercetin-mediated inhibition of hsp <dig> expression and sirna-mediated knockdown resulted in inhibition of viral infection. we also observed that hsp <dig> colocalized with the viral dsrna generated during viral replication and knockdown of hsp <dig> decreased the dsrna levels, suggesting hsp <dig> is involved in the formation of viral rtc and thus affects the viral replication.

RESULTS
prrsv infection induces the expression of hsp70
we firstly investigated the effect of prrsv infection on the expression of hsp <dig>  quantitative rt-pcr and western blotting were performed, respectively. the level of hsp <dig> mrna was up-regulated from 6 hours post infection  and viral n gene mrna could be detected from 12 h.p.i . the western blotting analysis revealed that the hsp <dig> was induced from 9 h.p.i and viral n protein could be detected from 15 h.p.i . meanwhile, the levels of hsp <dig> were detected at different time points after infection with prrsv at  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> multiplicity of infection . the induction of hsp <dig> was observed , which is consistent with the results shown in figure 1b.

quercetin reduces the viral production
to investigate the function of hsp <dig> during prrsv infection, we modulated the hsp <dig> expression by heat shock treatment or quercetin, and analyzed the effect on viral production. quercetin had no significant toxicity on marc- <dig> cells at lower concentrations , but cytotoxicity was found increasing at higher concentrations  . besides, the expression of hsp <dig> was significantly induced from 8 hours after heat shock treatment . thus, we performed the following experiments at 8 hours after heat shock treatment or with the quercetin at the concentration of 100 μm to induce or inhibit hsp <dig> expression, respectively. quercetin treatment decreased the production of viral progeny at different times post infection as indicated, and remarkably at 36 h.p.i . in contrast, heat shock treatment increased the viral production slightly at  <dig> and 18 h.p.i. however, this promotion was not found at  <dig> and 36 h.p.i .

quercetin prevents the viral protein expression
we then examined the effect of hsp <dig> expression on the viral protein level. western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence assay  were performed to detect the level of viral n protein. western blotting analysis showed that the synthesis of hsp <dig> was inhibited with quercetin treatment. meanwhile, the n protein expression was found decreased at different times post infection . quercetin reduced the n protein level in a dose-dependent manner . in contrast, heat shock treatment resulted in a slight increase of viral n in protein level compared to control .

previous heat shock treatment attenuates the inhibitory effect of quercetin
in order to determine whether the up-regulation of hsp <dig> could attenuate the inhibitory effect of quercetin on prrsv infection, marc- <dig> cells were submitted to heat shock treatment and subsequently infected with prrsv at the presence of quercetin. the results showed that quercetin reduced the n protein expression in a dose-dependent manner , which is in accordance with the results showed in figure 3b. the previous heat shock treatment could attenuate the inhibitory effect of quercetin on viral protein synthesis . the effect on viral production was also analyzed. as expected, previous heat shock treatment also could attenuate the inhibitory effect on viral production .

the effect of knockdown of hsp <dig> on the viral infection
quercetin is shown to suppress the cellular levels of heat shock factor  and result in the reduction of cellular hsps synthesis. hence, quercetin is not a specific inhibitor of hsp <dig>  in order to investigate the role of hsp <dig> during prrsv infection more specifically, sirna-mediated knockdown was performed. we observed that specific sirna could inhibit the expression of hsp <dig> in a dose-dependent manner. meanwhile, our results showed that the knockdown of hsp <dig> resulted in significant reduction of the amounts of viral n protein . however, these inhibitory effects on viral n protein expression could be rescued with heat shock treatment following sirna transfection . similar results were obtained by measuring the ccid <dig> .

the knockdown of hsp <dig> decreases the level of viral dsrna
the viral genome is transcribed into complementary negative-stranded rna which in turn is used as a template to synthesize new strands forming dsrna replicative intermedias  during positive-sense rna virus infection. in order to investigate whether the inhibition in viral protein synthesis and viral production is due to the replication inhibition, we detected the level of the viral dsrna generated during viral replication with specific antibody . our results showed that the level of dsrna was reduced by sirna in a dose dependent manner , suggesting hsp <dig> is important for prrsv replication.

hsp <dig> colocalizes with viral dsrna
positive-sense rna virus infection generates the rtcs which contain viral and host proteins, endoplasmic reticulum  membranes, as well as dsrnas. hence, dsrna has been used as a marker to conveniently examine the formation of viral replication and transcription complexe  in cells infected with many positive-sense rna viruses, such as kunjin virus  <cit> , rubella virus  <cit> , hepatitis c virus  <cit>  and prrsv  <cit> . the knockdown of hsp <dig> reduced the amount of prrsv dsrna , implying that hsp <dig> may be involved in the formation of rtc. to understand the relationship between hsp <dig> and viral rtc, confocal microscopy was performed to detect hsp <dig> and dsrna. our results showed that hsp <dig> was detected as diffuse staining in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic regions in uninfected cells, while it was found mostly accumulating in the perinuclear region and colocalizing with dsrna in prrsv-infected marc- <dig> cells .

quercetin reduced prrsv infection in porcine alveolar macrophages
porcine alveolar macrophages  are known to be an important primary target for prrsv replication, thus the anti-prrsv effect of quercetin was evaluated in pams. pams were more sensitive to quercetin compared to marc- <dig> cells, and the minimal toxicity was found at concentration below 50 μm . similar inhibitory effect on prrsv infection was found in pams with quercetin treatment . notably, hsp <dig> was induced in prrsv-infected pams , which is consistent with the observation shown in figure  <dig> 

discussion
prrsv infection results in substantial economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. however, no effective countermeasures exist to combat this deadly viral infection so far. the identification of host factors and exploration of their functions during virus infection not only will enable greater insight into the molecular mechanisms of viral pathogenesis, but also will provide a potential for the development of antiviral strategies.

virus infection leads to changes of many host proteins expression, and up-regulation of hsp <dig> following viral infection has been widely observed  <cit> . recently, hsp <dig> was also found to be elevated after prrsv infection based on transcriptome and proteome approaches  <cit> . in this study, we observed that prrsv infection induced hsp <dig> expression in vitro , implying that hsp <dig> may play a potential role in prrsv infection.

virus-induced hsp <dig> could be utilized to facilitate viral infection or to enhance intracellular defense against the invading microorganism. hence, hsp <dig> can regulate the viral infection positively or negatively  <cit> . to better understand the role of hsp <dig> during prrsv infection, we modulated the expression of hsp <dig> and analyzed the effect on viral infection. we observed that the down-regulation of hsp <dig> significantly reduced the level of viral n protein and viral production . pams are known to be the primary host cellular target for prrsv replication, thus the significant anti-prrsv effect of quercetin in these cells  suggests that it might also be effective agent against prrsv infection in vivo. however, overexpression of hsp <dig> following heat shock treatment resulted in slight increase of viral protein level and viral production , which is consistent with a previous research  <cit> . this is likely due to the fact that prrsv infection induced a rather high level of hsp <dig>  which is sufficient to support prrsv replication.

as expected, previous heat shock treatment could attenuate the inhibitory effects of quercetin on the prrsv . notably, quercetin at the concentration of 100 μm still has a strong inhibitory effect even with the previous heat shock treatment . this is likely because that quercetin at higher concentration powerfully inhibits the hsps protein synthesis, and up-regulation of inducible hsps  induced by previous heat shock treatment can not compeletly compensate the inhibition effect of quercetin. these results suggested other chaperones which are generally constitutive and not sensitive to stimuli may also be involved in the prrsv life cycle, such as heat shock cognate protein  <dig>  and hsp90β  <cit> . hsc <dig> can be involved in different steps of viral life cycle, such as entry  <cit> , disassembly  <cit> , translocation  <cit>  and release  <cit> . hsp90β, a constitutive cytoplasmic isoform of hsp <dig>  has been reported as a critical host factor required for japanese encephalitis virus  infectivity in bhk- <dig> cells  <cit> . further studies may be required to address whether hsc <dig> and hsp90β are involved in the prrsv life cycle and to figure out their role during viral infection.

using sirna-mediated silencing approach, we specifically established the importance of hsp <dig> during prrsv infection. we observed that sirna-mediated depletion of hsp <dig> led to inhibition of viral protein synthesis and viral production in a dose-dependent manner. however, this inhibition could be rescued by heat shock treatment following transfection . these results indicated that hsp <dig> is essential for prrsv infection, suggesting its proviral nature.

positive-sense rna virus infection forms dsrna ri following the synthesis of complementary negative-sense rna which is used as template to synthesize new strands. to investigate whether hsp <dig> play any role in the prrsv replication, we detected the dsrna level using specific antibody . our results showed that the knockdown of hsp <dig> resulted in reduction of dsrna , indicating hsp <dig> is important for prrsv replication. viral dsrna is contained in the rtc, hence dsrna is used as a marker to examine the formation of viral rtc  <cit> . the reduction of dsrna level may be due to the blockade of viral rtc formation. confocal microscopic analysis was performed to examine if hsp <dig> associates with the rtc. we observed a strong colocalization of cytoplasmic hsp <dig> and dsrna in prrsv-infected cells , suggesting hsp <dig> may be involved in the formation of viral rtc and thus affect the viral replication. the formation of rtc composed of viral dsrna ris, viral replicases, altered cellular membranes and some cellular proteins, is a hallmark of all positive-stranded rna viruses  <cit> . hsp <dig> is frequently recruited to help the assembly of viral replicases into the rtc  <cit> . previous studies have implicated that several replicases of prrsv, including nsp1β, nsp <dig>  nsp <dig>  nsp <dig>  nsp7α, nsp7β, nsp <dig> and nsp <dig> may be included in the prrsv rtc  <cit> . hsp <dig> may be recruited to enhance these nsps stability and to assist their translocation into the rtc. further studies are required to address the interactions of hsp <dig> with these nsps, and to figure out how these interactions might regulate viral replication.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our study has demonstrated that hsp <dig> is a crucial host factor recruited by prrsv and plays a positive role in regulating the viral replication. furthermore, our findings suggested that inhibition of hsp <dig> might be an efficient antiviral strategy against prrsv infection. the direct interactions of hsp <dig> and viral proteins should be determined in details in the future.
