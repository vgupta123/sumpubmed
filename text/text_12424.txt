BACKGROUND
the amphinomid polychaete hermodice carunculata  is a cosmopolitan and ecologically important omnivore inhabiting coral reefs and other habitats throughout the atlantic ocean, including the gulf of mexico and the caribbean sea, as well as the mediterranean and red seas  <cit> . it is known to prey on a diverse suite of reef organisms such as zoanthids  <cit> , scleractinian corals  <cit> , milleporid hydrocorals  <cit> , anemones  <cit>  and gorgonians  <cit> . hermodice carunculata is also a winter reservoir and spring-summer vector for the coral-bleaching pathogen vibrio shiloi  <cit>  and plays a complex and potentially ecologically important role in coral reef ecosystem health.

amphinomidae is a well-delineated clade within aciculate polychaetes and it comprises approximately  <dig> described species from  <dig> genera  <cit> . amphinomids are distributed worldwide and are known to inhabit intertidal, continental shelf and shallow reef communities, with a few species also recorded from the deep-sea  <cit> . the clade is primarily identified by a series of morphological apomorphies including nuchal organs situated on a caruncle, a ventral muscular eversible proboscis with thickened cuticle on circular lamellae, and calcareous chaetae  <cit> . due to the lack of knowledge regarding their morphological variability , previous studies based mainly on morphology have failed to clarify the evolutionary history of the group, leading to taxonomic problems. in fact, several nominal species have been regarded as conspecifics, often without evaluation of molecular data, which might explain the common occurrence of cosmopolitan species within the clade  <cit> . consequently, detailed revisions of species and even genera are needed  <cit> , which incorporate molecular phylogenetic studies to clarify the affinities within the family  <cit> . additionally, amphinomids are group with unclear phylogenetic position within annelida as different studies find different evolutionary affinities for the group  <cit> , but regarded as morphologically primitive and considered of prime interest for determining the root of the annelid tree of life  <cit> . however, the availability of genomic data in public databases for hermodice carunculata and other amphinomid species is particularly scarce. previous to this study, only  <dig> sequences were accessible in ncbi for h. carunculata.

furthermore, the annelid hermodice carunculata is a representative of the lophotrochozoa, a clade of protostome bilaterian animals that comprises about half of the extant animal phyla, including mollusca, the second most diverse phylum  <cit> . annelids, in general, are of interest within lophotrochozoans because they are among the first coelomates  <cit>  and polychaetes in particular, exhibit ancestral traits in body plan and embryonic development  <cit> . nevertheless, polychaete annelids and lophotrochozoans have been heavily underrepresented in sequencing efforts, therefore, genomic resources for this key bilaterian clade are still relatively poor compared to the other two major bilaterian clades   <cit> . a more complete representation of taxa in the genomic databases is needed to better understand animal evolution and unravel the origins of organismal diversity, especially of crucial clades such as the lophotrochozoa  <cit> .

here, we provide a de novo transcriptome assembly of hermodice carunculata, a cosmopolitan lophotrochozoan polychaete that inhabits coral reefs throughout the atlantic ocean. in this study we use the illumina hiseq platform to generate a cdna library for h. carunculata. these next-generation sequencing  libraries have an enormous sequencing depth and better effectiveness, producing at least  <dig> to  <dig>  times higher throughput than classical sanger sequencing  <cit> . this allows for the examination of thousands of transcripts from uncharacterized species and renders it useful for a wide range of biological applications including phylogenomics  <cit> , regulatory gene discovery  <cit> , molecular marker development  <cit> , single nucleotide polymorphism  identification for trait adaptation  <cit> , haplotype detection  <cit> , and differential gene expression profiling  <cit> . in this study we provide a reference set of mrna sequences for h. carunculata, which will facilitate annotation of the genome and future studies of polychaete evolution, systematics and functional genomics. we specifically focused on major signaling pathways and housekeeping genes, as well as genes related to reproduction and immune response, and we provide a comprehensive list of genes related to these key processes in the annelid h. carunculata.

RESULTS
sequencing and de novo assembly
total rna was extracted from the body-segment h. carunculata. the + rna was isolated, sheered to smaller fragments, and reverse transcribed to make cdna for sequencing with hi-seq illumina  <dig>  four hundred million paired-end strand-unspecific reads were obtained from one lane of one plate, generating  <dig>  gigabase pairs  of raw data that were uploaded to ncbi. reads were checked for phred-like quality scores above the q <dig> level with fastqc  <cit> . we used the pipeline proposed in  <cit>  to remove low quality reads for de novo assembly. hiseq illumina read sequences were assembled into  <dig>  contigs longer than 200 bp, with an n <dig> of  <dig>  and mean length of  <dig>  bp, using abyss  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , followed by blat   <cit>  for redundancy removal. a range of 8 k-mers  were used for abyss runs, with the parameter q =  <dig> to trim low-quality bases from the ends of reads for each run. the final data set was filtered for contigs longer than 200 bp. summary statistics for each k-mer assembly, as well as for the merged and redundant-removed set of contigs is outlined in table  <dig>  paired-end reads and assembled contigs that do not contain ambiguous bases have been deposited into ncbi and can be downloaded at the ncbi sequence read archive: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/srx194586%5baccn%5d.table  <dig>

for each k-mer, data from abyss is shown. the final assmbly is the result of merging the abyss k-mer assemblies using blat to remove the redundancies. predicted orf’s longer than 200aa’s from this final contig set were used for annotation. k-mer = required length of overlap match between two reads in abyss; n50 = length weigthed median contig length; bp = base pair; orf = open reading frame.



assemblies at higher k-mers  had lower mean length and n <dig> than assemblies at lower k-mers  . this is in agreement with other summary statistics of ngs reported de novo assembly data  <cit> . the lower n <dig> and mean in the final merged dataset, compared with k-mer  <dig> and k-mer  <dig>  is due to addition of shorter sequences from lower k-mer assemblies. as outlined in table  <dig>  the n <dig> has changed from  <dig> in k-mer  <dig> to 1095 bp in the merged set of contigs, indicating an improvement in the assembly contig length. although the majority of the contig length is between 200–600 bp, we obtained  <dig>  contigs, with length greater than  <dig>  bp . this result indicates that the data has a very high quality for further annotation. lastly, the assembled sequences were deposited in transcriptome shotgun assembly  at the ncbi.figure  <dig> assembled contig length distribution. each number on top of each bar represents number of assembled contigs per length category.



a six frame translation  from stop to stop for each assembled contig was generated using the emboss package, version:  <dig> . <dig>   <cit> . this file contained  <dig>  predicted orfs longer than  <dig> aa, with the n <dig> of  <dig> aa, and mean length of  <dig>  aa.

comparative sequence similarity with other annelids
for comparative annotation, all orfs longer than  <dig> aa  were initially searched against two existing annelid genomic datasets, capitella teleta  and helobdella robusta ; and subsequently against paramphinome jeffreysi and eurythoe complanata, using blastp  <cit>  with a significant e-value of 2e− <dig>  similarity search showed that  <dig>   orfs have similarity higher than 70% against c. teleta, while  <dig>   orfs have similarity higher than 70% against h. robusta . this indicates that the proportion of sequences with matches in the proteome of c. teleta is greater than the proportion of matches for h. robusta. this is expected, as c. teleta and h. carunculata are both polychaete annelids, as opposed to h. robusta, a leech . in total,  <dig>  transcripts had a significant hit  in both datasets. furthermore,  <dig>  of these orfs showed homology to p. jeffreysi and  <dig>  to e. complanata. of these orfs,  <dig>  were homologous to both paramphinome jeffreysi and eurythoe complanata. these shared sequences can be used for future genome annotation of both annelids and amphinomids, respectively .figure  <dig> venn diagram distribution of similarity search results for hermodice carunculata. based on  <dig>  predicted open reading frames  of genes longer than  <dig> amino acids. the number of unique sequence-based annotation is the best sum of unique blastp hits  from capitella teleta and helobdella robusta proteome, respectively.



functional annotation and characterization
one of the important aspects of mining the transcriptomic data is assigning function to individual transcripts. functional annotation is an effective way to categorize genes into physiological classes to assist in understanding the large quantity of transcripts and for evaluating functional differences between subgroups of sequences. these data provide a tool for designing custom microarray experiments related to annotated functions  <cit> . gene ontology   <cit>  is an extensive scheme for this purpose. this framework covers a wide biological scope, and with its directed acyclic graph  structure, it accounts for biological dependencies. in addition, programs such as interproscan  <cit>  provide an integrated platform for domain-based searches against databases such as prosite  <cit> , prints  <cit> , pfam  <cit> , and smart  <cit> , in addition to others. over the past few years, resources have been developed for automatic go term and interpro id assignment to unknown sequences. blast2go  <cit>  was utilized for functional annotation, visualization and its associated statistics.

as part of the blast2go pipeline, orfs longer than  <dig> aa  were subjected to sequence homology search against the non-redundant protein database  at ncbi, using blastp . followed by mapping to collect go terms, and assigning reliable information to each query sequence. default values of blast2go annotation parameters were chosen to optimize the ratio between annotation accuracy and coverage  <cit> . this provided a framework for categorizing genes into functional annotation groups, namely biological process , molecular function , and cellular compartment. furthermore, interpro ids  were assigned to sequences by running interproscan .

out of  <dig>  predicted orfs,  <dig> %  of the data contained definitive functional annotation. these sequences were classified into three categories : biological process, cellular component and molecular function. the summary of classification of annotation is reported at level  <dig> of go category. in the molecular function, the clusters relating to “binding” and “catalytic activity” were enriched  . in the biological process classification, “metabolic process” with  <dig>  sequences, “cellular processes” with  <dig>  sequences, and “biological regulation” with  <dig>  sequences were large compared to “regulation of anatomical structure size” and “cell growth” with about  <dig> sequences each . this is expected, as these data are not collected from a developmental stage with high rate of divisions. in the cellular component category, the cluster size of “cell” with  <dig>  sequences and “organelle” with  <dig>  sequences were highly represented compared to “microbody” or “extracellular matrix” with less than  <dig> sequences each . this pattern is very similar to a recent analysis of lymnae stagnalis  transcriptome functional annotation  <cit> .figure  <dig> functional annotation of hermodice carunculata transcripts. the  <dig> most abundant goslim terms based on a molecular function, b biological processes, c cellular component.



in terms of length distribution of annotated sequences, 70% to 90% of the sequences with length ranging from  <dig> aa to  <dig>  aa were functionally annotated, while 100% of the sequences with length between  <dig>  aa to  <dig>  aa had a go term assigned to them . this result indicates that longer sequences have a higher rate of annotation than shorter sequences. the annotated sequences and a table representing sequence ids with their assigned go terms and interpro ids and enzyme codes are reported .figure  <dig> percentage of functionally annotated transcripts relative to their length.



identification of candidate genes and potential phylogenetic markers
signaling pathway and housekeeping genes
we identified  <dig> homologs of housekeeping genes belonging to cat, mat, pfk, atp synthase and  <dig>  homologs of signaling pathways belonging to activin, deltex, dpp, fringe, jagged, notch, notch <dig>  smad, tgf- β; . riesgo and colleagues  <cit> , in their analysis of ten transcriptomes of newly sequenced invertebrates, found similar homologs in mollusk and annelid transcriptomes.

immune response genes
we identified  <dig> orthologous sequences of  <dig> genes involved in immune response , including caspase, interleukin, toll-like receptors, irf genes, ficolin, antistasin and angiopoietin among others.

reproduction genes
we identified  <dig> homologous sequences to  <dig> genes in>volved in reproduction, including attractin, vasa, germ cell-less, piwi, smaug, nanos, zona pellucida, spermatogenesis-associated proteins and zonadhesin .

potential phylogenetic markers
using reciprocal blast searches between the hermodice carunculata transcriptome and publicly available sequences, we have identified putative h. carunculata homologues of genes that have been previously used as phylogenetic markers in annelida but were unavailable for h. carunculata and amphinomids in general, with a few exceptions. we identified  <dig> homologous sequences of ef-1α,  <dig> homologous to h <dig>   <dig> homologous to cytb, and  <dig> homologous to u <dig> snrna. we chose the longest sequence in each category for downstream phylogenetic analysis. the alignment of each of these sequences, along with the five best hits retrieved by blast from the ncbi database, are available in the supplementary materials . sequences were deposited in genebank.

light production genes
a search for sequence homology in the transcriptome of hermodice carunculata against  <dig> known bioluminescent-related proteins, such as the photoproteins obelin, aequorin, and other luciferases, found eight sequence transcripts with an average of  <dig> % homology to the luciferase protein of the phylogenetically distant sea pansy renilla reniformis . an alignment of the h. carunculata putative luciferase with renilla luciferase is generated  and the corresponding cdna sequences are included .figure  <dig> overlapping region of amino acid sequence alignment of homologous proteins sequences to luciferase from the sea pansy, renilla sp.



in silico quantification of the hermodice carunculata transcriptome
in order to identify poor quality and potentially misassembled transcripts, reads were mapped back onto the non-redundant set of transcripts  <cit> . the number of reads corresponding to each transcript ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> with an average of  <dig>  reads, indicating a wide range of expression . this indicates that very low expressed transcripts were represented in our dataset. furthermore, we analyzed the coverage of the functionally annotated transcripts. the minimum coverage was  <dig> fpkm and maximum was  <dig>  fpkm. among these,  <dig> transcripts had a mean coverage less than  <dig>  or gaps were removed from dataset .table  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
relying on next generation sequencing techniques and a thorough bioinformatics pipeline we have generated a comprehensive list of major signaling pathways, housekeeping genes, and genes related to reproduction and immune response in a representative of the lophotrochozoa, the polychaete annelid hermodice carunculata, whose phylogenetic placement within annelida has been difficult to resolve. major signaling pathways are highly evolutionarily conserved across metazoa and play an important role during embryonic and adult development, regulating many fundamental cellular processes such as proliferation, stem cell maintenance, differentiation, migration or apoptosis  <cit> . in addition, some genes such as those involved in notch signaling might have a role in segment formation and adult regeneration in polychaetes  <cit> . housekeeping genes are required for the maintenance of essential basal cellular functions and consequently, under normal conditions, they are expressed in all cells regardless of tissue type or developmental stage  <cit> . they are especially interesting because they represent the minimal set of genes required to sustain life and they can be used as comparative controls for experimental and computational studies  <cit> , for example, to assess the suitability of transcriptome datasets for gene discovery  <cit> . immune response genes are also of great concern especially among invertebrates because they represent an early model of the more highly evolved innate immune system of vertebrates  <cit> . knowledge of the invertebrate immune system is based mainly in two ecdysozoan model organisms, drosophila melanogaster and caenorabditis elegans, and although lophotrochozoan systems show some distinct differences  <cit> , studies focusing on this group are very limited. lastly, characterization of the reproductive genes of polychaetes is of interest as they exhibit an astonishing diversity of reproductive strategies, including both sexual and asexual reproduction, and range from spawning and external fertilization to brooding or viviparism, often involving marked morphological, physiological and behavioral modifications  <cit> . for example, some amphinomids such as eurythoe complanata or cryptonome conclava exhibit both sexual and asexual reproduction, the latter accomplished by architomic scissiparity: the body fragments in two or more parts which regenerate head, tail or both  <cit> .

sex pheromones have been postulated to drive cryptic speciation in oligochaetes  <cit> . within polychaetes, there are several species known to use pheromones to attract the opposite sex and to control the release of gametes, such as the scale worm harmothoe imbricata  <cit> , the rag worms nereis succinea and platynereis dumerilii and the lugworm arenicola marina  <cit> . the sex pheromone attractin has been suggested by previous authors as a potential phylogenetic marker  <cit> . as part of our annotation pipeline, we have identified seven sequences homologous to attractin in the transcriptome of hermodice carunculata. a phylogenetic analysis was performed to evaluate the potential of the h. carunculata attractin protein as a reliable phylogenetic marker for polychaete systematics and evolutionary studies. our analysis corroborates results by previous authors  <cit>  suggesting that attractin represents an effective phylogenetic marker, recovering deep metazoan relationships  and important clades such as bilateria, its split into deuterostomia and protostomia, and the subdivision of the latter in ecdysozoa and spiralia . attractin also recovers annelida as a monophyletic group .figure  <dig> maximum likelihood tree of  <dig> attractin proteins and one newly identified attractin sequence from hermodice carunculata. the newly identified attractin is colored red.



several so-called cosmopolitan species within amphinomids have proven to comprise various cryptic species  <cit> . hermodice carunculata has a widespread distribution and has been reported throughout the atlantic ocean, caribbean, mediterranean and red sea  <cit> . despite its widespread distribution, its representation in ncbi consisted of only  <dig> nucleotide sequences and only a handful of studies have examined genetic aspects of h. carunculata. for example, in a species delineation study, two mitochondrial genes  and the internal transcribed spacer  <dig>  were used to test for cryptic speciation in h. carunculata  <cit> . this analysis showed that genetic divergence is low among samples across the atlantic ocean, and these particular three genes do not reflect any genetic basis for the observed morphological differences  among populations. therefore, identification of informative loci for phylogeographic application is necessary. however, a different study using coi sequences has found that eurythoe complanata represents a complex of three genetically distinct and morphologically indistinguishable lineages inhabiting the atlantic and pacific oceans. also, the deep-sea genus archinome has been shown to comprise four genetically distinct lineages with no apparent morphological differences  <cit> . therefore, the de novo assembled transcriptome presented herein for hermodice carunculata, can also be used to develop additional molecular phylogenetic markers to aid forthcoming studies of species boundaries and evolutionary relationships within amphinomidae. furthermore, amphinomids are a morphologically plesiomorphic group of annelids, considered as a highly important taxon for reconstructing relationships at the base of the annelid tree  <cit> . thus, the vast amount of molecular data provided herein can also help to elucidate the basal relationships of annelida.

within annelid polychaetes there are a number of bioluminescent species distributed in various families such as acrocirridae , chaetopteridae , flabelligeridae , polynoidae , syllidae , terebellidae  and tomopteridae   <cit> . to date, no bioluminescent protein sequence has been reported from this phylum, but we do report homologous sequences of a luciferase protein . the fact that the putative hermodice carunculata luciferase shows highest homology to the luciferase of a phylogenetically distant cnidarian  can probably be attributable to the lack of publicly available luciferase sequences from more closely related organisms. the transcriptomic dataset presented herein can greatly help identify and characterize this putative photoprotein and facilitate future studies investigating the genetic and biochemical basis of light production in annelids. in addition, we report both green and red biofluorescence in hermodice carunculata, yet the search of the genome showed no homology to any known fluorescent protein species .figure  <dig> fluorescent macro image of hermodice carunculata using 450–500 nm excitation and 514 nm lp emission ; white light image ; and fluorescent macro comparison  ; confocal images  obtained with a olympus fluoview fv <dig>  confocal laser scanning microscope using an olympus lumfl 60×/ <dig>  w objective , illustrating distrubution of green and red fluorescence;  emission spectra using an ocean optics usb2000+ miniature spectrometer  equipped with a hand-held fiber optic probe .



an additional recent approach in estimating more accurate intergeneric and intrageneric level relationships utilizes conserved blocks of homologous sequences shared between genomic regions of multiple species  <cit> . our data provides a complementary resource for this kind of application in the future. also, the annotation of the genomes is reliant on transcriptome data for the exon intron boundary delimitation. our data provide a base for future genomic and ecological research on hermodice carunculata, as well as a resource to understand the natural history of polychaetes and the evolution of annelids in general.
