BACKGROUND
chitinase-like proteins  are structurally homologous to chitinases but lack the ability to degrade chitin  <cit> . several clps have been identified in mice and humans  <cit> . mice express primarily breast regression protein- <dig>  , ym <dig>  and ym <dig> , whereas humans produce ykl- <dig> , the human homologue of brp- <dig>  but do not synthesize ym <dig> and ym <dig>  <cit> .

brp- <dig> and ykl- <dig> are glycoproteins that are secreted by various cell types, including macrophages and chondrocytes as well as tumor cells  <cit> . the amino acid sequence of mouse brp- <dig> shares 73% identity with that of ykl- <dig>  <cit> . a recent study has shown that brp- <dig> and ykl- <dig> are functionally equivalent  <cit> . ym <dig> shows a high degree of sequence homology to ym <dig> with 91% amino acid sequence identity, but these proteins exhibit different expression patterns  <cit> .

based on sequence similarities, clps belong to the family  <dig> of the glycosyl hydrolases  <cit> . family  <dig> of the glycosyl hydrolases includes two catalytically active mammalian chitinases, chitotriosidase  and acidic mammalian chitinase   <cit> . the conserved sequence involved in catalysis in family  <dig> of the chitinases is dxxdxdxe, where e is assumed to be the catalytic residue  <cit> . it is generally assumed that the lack of chitinase activity in clps is due to the mutation of crucial residues within the conserved catalytic sequence during evolution  <cit> .

increased levels of clps mrnas and/or proteins have been noted in many inflammatory conditions  <cit> . brp-39/ykl- <dig> levels are increased in individuals with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, alcoholic cirrhosis and different types of malignant tumors  <cit> . ym <dig> is synthesized during inflammation caused by parasitic infections  <cit> . ym <dig> and ym <dig> are expressed during allergic pulmonary inflammation  <cit> . thus, clps may play important roles in many pathophysiological conditions  <cit> . however, the contribution of these proteins to the pathophysiology of these diseases remains to be determined.

recently we established quantitative real-time pcr  using a single standard dna to quantify the expression levels of chitinases and reference genes  <cit> . this method enables us to quantify and compare the expression levels of multiple genes in the same scale. because clps lack chitinolytic activity and detectable functions, their biochemical properties have only been partially defined  <cit> . the individual quantification of brp- <dig>  ym <dig> and ym <dig> is an important step in gaining insight into the in vivo regulation of the clps.

in this study, we established qpcr system to quantify the expression of brp- <dig>  ym <dig> and ym <dig> individually and compared their expression levels to reference genes using the same scale in mouse tissues. our study shows that the expression levels of brp- <dig> and ym <dig> in the mouse lung are higher than those of two active chitinases and are comparable to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , a housekeeping gene which is constitutively expressed in all tissues to maintain cellular functions  <cit> .

methods
rna and cdna preparation
the qpcr assay has been designed according to the minimum information for publication of quantitative real-time pcr experiments  guidelines  <cit> .

we used two types of rna samples in this research. one is the commercially available total rna samples pooled from 200 ~  <dig>  mice . the company tested rigorously the rna integrity. we used the total rna samples to examine the distribution of the transcripts in various mouse tissues. moreover, we used total rna isolated from the lungs and stomachs of 3-month-old male mice . all animal procedures were conducted according to the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals of the riken and were approved by the riken institutional animal care and use committee . c57bl/6 j mice  were bred at the riken brain science institute animal facility. lung and stomach tissue samples for rna analysis were immediately frozen at -80°c. those tissues for mrna preparation were provided by drs. miyazaki and nukina at riken brain science institute. total rna was prepared from the tissues using trizol reagent  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. to remove the trace amounts of contaminating genomic dna, the samples were treated with rq <dig> rnase-free dnase  according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. the ratio of absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm is used to assess the purity of dna and rna. the ratio of each sample was ~ <dig>  using a biophotometer plus . the concentrations of the nucleic acids were determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm.

the total rna samples  were subjected to reverse transcription using random hexamers. the reaction mixture  contained the enzyme buffer , 100 ng of random hexamers , 10 mm dithiothreitol, and  <dig>  mm deoxynucleotide triphosphates . after heating the solution to 60°c for 5 min and incubating the mixture at 37°c for 5 min,  <dig> u of recombinant murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase  was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37°c for 45 min. the reverse transcription was terminated by heating to 95°c for 5 min.

selection of primer pairs for qpcr
primers for qpcr were designed based on primer express software  and were synthesized commercially . the pcr reactions were performed in a final volume of 13 μl containing  <dig> x sybr green master mix ,  <dig>  ng of mouse cdna or appropriate dilutions of the external standards , and  <dig>  pmol of the primers for the three clps. the pcr reactions were performed using mx3005p qpcr system . the pcr program was as follows: 10 min of denaturation at 95°c, 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°c for 30 sec, annealing at 55°c for 1 min and polymerization at 72°c for 1 min. melting curves were generated after amplification. the pcr products were electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed using the luminescent image analyzer . the nucleotide sequences of the primers that were used for the qpcr are shown in supplementary information . the chit <dig>  amcase, pepsinogen c, gapdh and β-actin primers have been previously reported  <cit> .

construction of the mouse refs/clps standard dna
the cdna fragments covering the pcr-target region plus 11– <dig> nucleotides of the flanking regions of brp- <dig>  ym <dig> and ym <dig> were amplified from a mouse tissue cdna mixture by pcr. the forward and reverse primers are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the primers contained 6-bp long ecori, bglii or xhoi recognition sites  and 25-bp long sequences corresponding to the nucleotides of each clp cdna . these primers also contain additional 4-bp extra nucleotides  to ensure the efficient cleavage of the amplified cdnas by the restriction enzymes . each amplified dna fragment contained restriction sites anchored to the pcr primer sets. these pcr products were purified using the wizard sv gel and pcr clean-up system  and then digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, separated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and re-purified using the clean-up system. each fragment was then ligated using t <dig> dna ligase . the ligated fragments were pcr-amplified again using the forward primer  and the reverse primer  . the resulting fragments were used as the clps standard dna.

construction of the five reference genes  and three clps  standard dna for the mouse genes was performed as previously described  <cit> . briefly, mouse refs standard dna consisting of amcase/pepsinogen c/chit1/gapdh/β-actin and containing an ecori restriction site at the 3’ terminus, was amplified from the standard dna for mouse chitinase using pcr  <cit> . both the clps and the mouse refs standard dnas were digested with ecori and ligated using t <dig> dna ligase. the ligated fragments were amplified using the forward primer  and the reverse primer  . the pcr product was purified, and 3’-da was added to the amplified dna using takara taq hs  and the resulting fragment was cloned into the pgem-t easy vector . the plasmid containing the cdna insert was sequenced using the abi prism big-dye terminator v <dig>  cycle sequencing kit and the  <dig> genetic analyzer instrument . the mouse refs/clps standard dna  was prepared by pcr reamplification from the plasmid dna using the same primers; the pcr product was purified as described above and was thereafter used as the standard dna.

the mouse refs/clps standard dna with pgem-t easy vector  was prepared by pcr from the plasmid dna using the forward primer  and the reverse primer . the amplified dna was purified and subsequently used as the mouse refs/clps standard dna with pgem-t easy.

preparation of brp- <dig>  ym <dig> and ym <dig> cdnas covering the entire coding region
the cdna covering the entire coding regions of brp- <dig>  ym <dig> and ym <dig> were amplified from mouse lung  or stomach  tissue cdna by pcr using primers  and were subcloned into the pcdna <dig> /v5-his c vector . the cdnas were sequence-verified . the subcloned fragments were reamplified from the plasmid dnas using the same primers , and the resulting fragments were used as the entire coding regions of the cdnas.

standard curves and mrna quantification using qpcr
the molar concentration of the standard dna was calculated based on the concentration and the molecular weight. the concentrations of the nucleic acids were determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. the molar concentration of the multigene-containing dna standard was calculated based on the concentration and the molecular weight. serial dilutions were prepared starting with the standard template concentration, which yielded a ct of approximately  <dig> . the standard dna was subjected to 10-fold serial dilutions, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> molecules, and the aliquots were kept frozen at -20°c until use.

standard qpcr was performed as follows: initial denaturation and polymerase activation step at 95°c for 10 min, 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°c for 30 sec, annealing at 55°c for 30 sec and polymerization at 72°c for 10 sec. the standard curves were constructed, and mrna quantification was performed. each sample was amplified in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least two times.

statistical analyses
data are shown as mean with standard deviation . we used student’s t test for mrna-level analyses. statistical significance was set at p <  <dig> .

RESULTS
establishment of a qpcr system for the detection of clps in mouse tissues
first, we aimed to quantify the clps genes expression levels across normal mouse tissues and to compare the mrna levels of clps and the mammalian chitinases and reference genes .

we first established qpcr system that is capable of determining the multiple mrnas levels using the same scale. we designed primer sets to analyze clp expression using quantitative pcr, as described in the methods section. ym <dig> shared extensive nucleotide sequence homology with ym <dig>  with an identity of 94% along the entire molecule   <cit> . to prevent mispriming, we designed reverse primers that were unique at the 3’ terminal region . however, because ym <dig> and ym <dig> share very high sequence homology, we have to choose the forward primers highly homologous between ym <dig> and ym <dig> . we also designed brp- <dig> specific primers .we evaluated primer suitability based on whether they produced single products, as reflected by a single melting temperature  and a single band on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. the pcr products were amplified from a mouse tissue cdna mixture. as shown in figure 4a-c, only single peaks appeared in the dissociation curves for ym <dig> , ym <dig>  and brp- <dig> . figure 4d shows clear single bands at the expected sizes for the ym <dig> , ym <dig>  and brp- <dig>  pcr fragments. these results indicate that the pcr is specific producing single amplicons from the mouse tissue cdna mixture.

construction of the mouse refs/clps standard dna
we set up a qpcr system for which a standard dna was necessary for accurate quantification of three clps. we used two chitinases and two housekeeping genes, gapdh and β-actin, along with pepsinogen c, as reference genes. to evaluate the clp levels, we used gapdh and β-actin because they are constitutively expressed at high levels in most tissues  <cit> . in addition, we chose pepsinogen c  as a reference gene in the stomach. pepsinogen c is an aspartic protease that functions as a digestive enzyme and is produced in the stomach. this enzyme constitutes a major component of the gastric mucosa  <cit> . using these reference genes, we evaluated gene expression of three clps and chitinases in mouse tissues.

we ligated the clps standard dna with the five reference genes cdna in a one-to-one ratio and then cloned this dna fragment into the pgem-t easy vector. the  <dig> -nucleotide-long dna contained five reference genes  and three clps cdna fragments that spanned the pcr target regions and 9- <dig> nucleotides of the flanking regions and contained several restriction sites . we name this molecule as the mouse refs/clps standard dna in this report.

evaluation of the mouse refs/clps standard dna with pgem-t easy
next, we examined whether the target cdnas were amplified from the mouse refs/clps standard dna using the primer sets for the eight cdnas. although the ym <dig> primers gave a single product, as reflected by a single melting temperature and a single band on a 10% polyacrylamide gel , the ym <dig> primers yielded three peaks and multiple bands . these results indicated that multiple products were amplified from the mouse refs/clps standard dna using the ym <dig> primers.

to understand and overcome this problem, we compared the nucleotide sequences of the standard dna and the ym <dig> forward primer using the ncbi blast search  tool and found that the ym <dig> forward primer can anneal to ym <dig>  and can be misprimed to the amcase cdnas. ym <dig> and ym <dig> did not share any homology with brp- <dig> and chit <dig>  therefore, in addition to the amplification of original ym <dig> cdna, two cdnas  can be amplified from the standard dna using the ym <dig> primers . this problem could not be solved by the annealing temperature modification.

many researchers have designed primers that span introns or intron/exon boundaries for rt-pcr analysis  <cit> . we cloned the mouse refs/clps standard dna into the pgem-t easy vector . to increase the distance between the amcase/ym <dig> and ym <dig> fragments, we prepared a linear standard dna containing the pgem-t easy sequence that contained brp-39/ym2/pgem-t easy/amcase/pep c/chit1/gapdh/β-actin/ym <dig> by pcr using the brp-39-forward  and ym <dig> reverse  primers . this standard dna is referred to as the mouse refs/clps standard dna with pgem-t easy .

we next examined whether the ym <dig> primers only amplified ym <dig> cdna from this standard dna. to avoid the misprimed amplification, we shortened the annealing and extension time in the qpcr program . after the pcr was performed, the ym <dig> primers yielded a single product, as reflected by a single melting temperature  and a single band on a 10% polyacrylamide gel at the expected size for the ym <dig> pcr product , as was case for the ym <dig> products ; these results indicated that a single product was amplified from the mouse refs/clps standard dna with pgem-t easy  using the ym <dig> primer. thus, the pgem-t easy sequence  worked as an intron sequence in the pcr reaction. therefore, we used the mouse refs/clps standard dna with pgem-t easy as the standard dna unless otherwise specified.

validation of the standard curve and the qpcr system
the quantification of the clp, chitinase and the reference mrnas relies on standard curves. we next examined whether the three clps and five reference genes mrnas were accurately quantified using this system. serial dilutions of the mouse refs/clps standard dna with pgem-t easy  were used to construct an individual standard curve to compare and evaluate the qpcr quantification strategies that were used to analyze the eight mrnas. each standard curve was generated using 10-fold serial dilutions of the standard dna and the eight different primer pairs, yielding a dynamic range of seven orders of magnitude .

we next evaluated the qpcr quantification by analyzing the eight cdnas. to test the absolute equality of the curves, known concentration of the entire coding cdna  was amplified and subsequently analyzed as an unknown sample. as shown in figure 5a-h, blue closed rhombuses, equal quantities were observed for each tested dilution used to construct the standard curve. thus, we could quantify the clps and the reference mrnas using the same scale.

expression of clps in normal mouse tissues
to study the in vivo regulation of brp- <dig>  ym <dig> and ym <dig> gene expression, tissue cdnas reverse transcribed from total rna from four embryonic stages and eight adult tissues were analyzed using qpcr with the mouse refs/clps standard dna with pgem-t easy . the brp- <dig>  ym <dig> and ym <dig> mrnas were widely expressed in the mouse tissues .clear tissue specificities were observed in the expression patterns of these clps mrnas. brp- <dig> mrna was also widely expressed in normal mouse tissues . the highest levels of brp- <dig> mrna were detected in the lung, followed by the 7-day embryo, eye, stomach and 17-day embryo .similarly, the highest levels of ym <dig> mrna were detected in the mouse lung, followed by 7-day embryo , whereas the highest levels of ym <dig> mrna were detected in the mouse stomach, followed by the lung . in other tissues, the ym <dig> and ym <dig> mrnas were expressed at low, but easily detectable levels above background . when compared to the levels of ym <dig> mrna, brp- <dig> and ym <dig> were synthesized at the higher level in the lung tissue .

the expression levels of clp, chitinase and reference gene mrnas in mouse lung and stomach tissues
many studies on the pathophysiology of clps and mammalian chitinases have been performed using lung tissue  <cit> . in this study, we showed that ym <dig> mrna is highly expressed in mouse stomach tissue . additionally, amcase mrna was overexpressed in mouse stomach  <cit> .

we next compared the expression levels of the clps and reference genes using the lung and stomach tissue cdna as described in the methods. figure 7a shows the results obtained from mouse lung tissue. chit <dig> is a well-characterized mammalian chitinase in lung tissues. when the chit <dig> levels were set at  <dig> , the relative expression levels of the cdnas were  <dig> for brp- <dig>   <dig> for ym <dig>   <dig>  for ym <dig>   <dig>  for amcase,  <dig> for gapdh and  <dig> for β-actin in the mouse lung tissues . the lung tissues express higher levels of brp- <dig> and ym <dig> than chit <dig> and amcase, active mammalian chitinases . furthermore, the expression levels of brp- <dig> and ym <dig> in the mouse lung tissues were comparable to the level of gapdh, a well-known housekeeping gene that is constitutively expressed at high levels in most tissues  <cit> . these results indicate that brp- <dig> and ym <dig> are abundantly transcribed in the mouse lung.

figure 7b shows the results obtained in the mouse stomach tissues. when chit <dig> levels were set to  <dig> , the relative expression levels of the cdnas were  <dig>  for brp- <dig>   <dig>  for ym <dig>   <dig>  for ym <dig>   <dig> for amcase,  <dig> for gapdh,  <dig> for β-actin and  <dig>  for pepsinogen c in the mouse stomach tissues . the stomach tissues express much lower levels of brp- <dig> and ym <dig> than chit <dig> . although ym <dig> mrna was highly expressed in the stomach, its expression was lower than chit <dig>  an active mammalian chitinase . furthermore, the ym <dig> expression level was much lower than the levels of amcase, gapdh, β-actin and pepsinogen c. these results indicate that ym <dig> mrna is abundant in the stomach tissues.

discussion
clps are structurally related to chitinases but lack chitinolytic activity  <cit> . clps levels are increased in a number of serious pathological conditions. thus, the biomedical importance of clps has attracted considerable attention. in this study, we established a quantitation method for discriminating chitinase-like proteins and compared their mrna levels with those of the five reference genes. we showed that catalytically inactive brp- <dig> and ym <dig> are constitutive genes in mouse lung.

in our previous studies, we quantified and compared chit <dig> and amcase expression levels in mouse and human tissues  <cit> . here, we applied our methodology to the clps’ levels analysis. there was a concern that the primers for ym <dig> and ym <dig> could cross-react with each other because the nucleotide sequences of ym <dig> and ym <dig> are very similar. however, our primers for ym <dig> and ym <dig> can discriminate and amplify corresponding cdnas from the mouse tissue cdna mixture . the reverse primers for ym <dig> and ym <dig> contain unique sequences at their 3’ terminal regions, which strongly affect pcr efficiency, while the forward primers are similar between the ym <dig> and ym <dig> cdnas . our results indicate that either the forward or the reverse primer can contain unique sequences for the specific amplification of a target cdna, even though the nucleotide sequences are very similar between these cdnas. this notion can be applied to quantify molecules that are very similar to each other, such as ym <dig> and ym <dig> 

when we validated the mouse refs/clps standard dna, multiple products were amplified from the mouse refs/clps standard dna using the ym <dig> primers. this result suggested that there could be cross-reactions between ym1/amcase and ym <dig> . in general, when for designing primers for rt-pcr, intron sequences are included in the target region to avoid amplifying non-target products from the contaminating genomic dna  <cit> . because mammalian introns are more than approximately ~ <dig> kbp long, in general, genomic sequences are difficult to be amplified by pcr compared to target cdna. because the mouse refs/clps standard dna was cloned into the pgem-t easy vector , we prepared a linearized mouse refs/clps standard dna with pgem-t easy sequence between ym <dig> and ym <dig> using pcr . additionally, we changed our qpcr protocol . as a result, we overcame the problems, and through the validation of the mouse refs/clps standard dna with pgem-t easy, we could individually quantify ym <dig> and ym <dig> using the standard dna .

our results for the gene expression pattern of brp- <dig>  ym <dig> and ym <dig> were essentially consistent with previous reports  <cit> . additionally, our analysis was sufficiently sensitive to detect the clps and to provide a comprehensive survey of the gene expression patterns of the clps and reference genes using the same scale in mouse tissues. the order of mrna levels in mouse lung tissues were as follows: gapdh ≈ brp-39 ≈ ym1 > amcase > chit1 > ym <dig> 

we found that brp- <dig> and ym <dig> mrna displayed similar expression patterns . ym <dig> mrna was expressed at high levels in mouse lung, whereas ym <dig> mrna was detected in stomach, followed by lung. although ym <dig> and ym <dig> show high sequence homology, there is differential expression between them. a detailed characterization of the promoter regions of the clps genes and the identification of the cis- and trans-acting factors will be required to understand the selective gene expression of these clps in mice.

in mouse lung tissues, we found that the mrna levels of brp- <dig> and ym <dig> were higher than chit <dig> and amcase, which are active chitinases. the levels of brp- <dig> and ym <dig> mrna were comparable to those of gapdh, a typical constitutive gene. in the lungs, chit <dig> and amcase can act as part of the host defense system to protect against chitin-containing pathogens, such as fungi and mites  <cit> . compared with active chitinases, brp- <dig> and ym <dig> are highly expressed in the mouse lung. in addition, brp- <dig> and ym <dig> seem to be co-expressed in mouse lung . qureshi et al. reported that brp- <dig>  ym <dig> and ym <dig> are overexpressed in a model of inflammation-promoted incipient neoplasia  <cit> . they suggested that these clps may promote tissue remodeling and amplify immune responses  <cit> . although brp- <dig> and ym <dig> have been reported to lack detectable chitinolytic activity, the high levels of their expression in mice suggest the physiological importance as biological defense in the mouse lung.

amcase is predominantly overexpressed in the mouse stomach  <cit> , and a robust peak of activity was observed at ph  <dig> , suggesting that amcase can function as a digestive enzyme that breaks down chitin-containing foods  <cit> . chit <dig> is highly expressed  in stomach as compared to lung tissue . because chit <dig> does not possess any chitinolytic activity at low gastric ph  <dig>  <cit> , it seems that chit <dig> does not contribute to chitinase activity in stomach. it has been shown that chit <dig> is produced at sites of near-neutral ph, such as the non-glandular portion of the stomach and the small intestine  <cit> . thus, chit <dig> may also function as a digestive enzyme that breaks down polymeric chitin under the neutral tissue conditions such as small intestine.

ym <dig> expression was lower than chit <dig> and amcase but was much higher compared to brp- <dig> and ym <dig>  the function of ym <dig> is not yet known, although surface plasmon resonance has demonstrated that ym <dig> can bind to chitobiose, chitotriose and chitotetraose; additionally, heparin sulfate has also been suggested as a candidate ligand  <cit> . ym <dig> is also a clp protein of unknown function that is closely related to ym <dig>  <cit> . the high expression of ym <dig>  together with amcase, may be involved in food processing and defense mechanisms in the mouse stomach.

increased levels of chitinase and clp mrnas and/or proteins have been noted in many inflammatory conditions  <cit> . the level of chit <dig> is elevated in gaucher disease, in smokers and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  and alzheimer disease  <cit> . amcase expression and activity are also up-regulated during allergic airway responses in mouse models of asthma and by polymeric chitin administration  <cit> . thus, chitinases and clps may play important roles in many pathophysiological conditions  <cit> . however, the contribution of chitinases and clps to the pathophysiology of these diseases remains to be determined.

in many studies on clps expression, the relative quantification using qpcr or western blotting have been used for evaluation of clps levels  <cit> . both methods involve the normalization of the expression levels of the gene of interest with those of the housekeeping genes such as gapdh or β-actin. the relative quantification is easier to perform than the absolute quantification as the mrna levels of the gene of interest are compared to the housekeeping genes. however, relative quantification methods fail to compare the levels of the different gene transcripts on the same scale. although our method requires multiple steps associated with the construction of the standard dna, it can provide gene expression data that are directly comparable between different genes.

recent studies reported that the increased expression levels of brp-39/ykl- <dig> in diseased mouse and human lungs might be the result of expression deregulation  <cit> . furthermore, using brp-39-deficient and ykl- <dig> transgenic mice, it was demonstrated that these proteins are functionally equivalent and play roles in tissue remodeling, regulation of the cell death pathway and airway obstruction  <cit> . moreover, brp- <dig> is induced during bacterial infection, during which it promotes bacterial clearance by controlling cell death, inflammation, and remodeling via interleukin - <dig> receptor α <dig>  <cit> . using the quantification system described here, the clps mrna levels can be compared with mammalian chitinases across mouse tissues using qpcr. this type of analysis can help to understand the biological function of clps, particularly in the pathophysiological studies using murine models.

CONCLUSIONS
we established and validated a qpcr system for individual quantification of the expression of three clps and comparing their expression levels with those of reference genes using the same scale in mouse tissues. we found that brp- <dig> was the most highly expressed clp in the mouse lung, and its expression was comparable to that of gapdh, a major housekeeping gene. ym <dig> mrna was also expressed at a high level in the mouse lung, whereas ym <dig> mrna was abundant in the stomach. our results indicate that catalytically inactive brp- <dig> and ym <dig> are constitutively expressed in normal mouse lung.
