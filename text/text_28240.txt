BACKGROUND
genome-wide association studies  have identified hundreds of genetic loci for cardiovascular disease and it’s risk factors, including chronic inflammation and lipids . some of the identified genetic variants are associated with more than one phenotype, termed genetic pleiotropy  <cit> . examples are apoc <dig> and hnf1a , which are associated both with lipids and c-reactive protein   <cit> . as randomized clinical trials have shown a coextending effect of statin treatment on the lowering of ldl-cholesterol and crp, we do expect inflammation and lipids to share certain biological pathways  <cit> . moreover, there is accumulating evidence that the pleiotropic effects are partially independent, although the biological mechanisms are not fully understood  <cit> . the identification of further pleiotropic genes could provide insight into the biological mechanisms that link chronic inflammation to lipids.

therefore, we aimed to identify further shared genes for lipids and crp. in order to enhance the statistical power of genetic studies to find pleiotropic genes for the correlated phenotypes of interest, we applied a method that combines gwas meta-analysis summary statistics allowing for mixed directions of effect, a common observed phenomenon in genetic pleitropy  <cit> . in a second step we sought to replicate novel associations with lipids and crp in an independent sample of  <dig>  genotyped individuals for lipids and  <dig>  genotyped individuals for crp. we identified multiple overlapping genetic variants between crp and lipids and confirmed novel genes implicated in the biology of chronic inflammation.

RESULTS
bivariate genome-wide association analysis
we performed bivariate gwas meta-analyses by combining summary statistics  from the univariate gwas of crp pairing with the summary statistics of each gwas of the lipid phenotypes, using an empirical-weighted linear-combined test statistics   <cit> . this method allows mixed genetic effects in the univariate phenotype gwas, a phenomenon commonly observed in genetic studies.

crp and ldl-cholesterol
manhattan plots for the bivariate gwas are depicted in fig.  <dig>  table  <dig> indicates the results from the bivariate analysis combining crp and ldl-cholesterol genetic association data. the bivariate analysis resulted in  <dig> potentially pleiotropic loci. we identified fourteen loci associated with crp levels which had no genome-wide significant snp in the original gwas of crp. these potential novel associations were located in or near celsr <dig>  irf2bp <dig>  abcg <dig>  gcnt <dig>  hla-dqb <dig>  frk, trib <dig>  fads <dig>  st3gal <dig>  brap, c12orf <dig>  carm1/ldlr, ncan and rasip <dig>  the potential novel associations for ldl-cholesterol were located in or near gckr, il1f <dig>  rora, rasip <dig> and in hnf4a. the snps identified in the bivariate gwas near hla-dqb <dig>  frk, brap, c12orf <dig> and carm1/ldlr were not genome-wide significant in the original univariate gwas on ldl-cholesterol, however other snps in their vicinity were significant in the original gwas on ldl-cholesterol and the loci have thus been reported previously. the variants in and near ppp1r3b, hnf1a and apoc <dig> were already genome-wide significant in both gwas of crp and ldl-cholesterol.fig.  <dig> manhattan plots of the bivariate genome-wide association studies combining c-reactive protein with ldl-cholesterol, hdl-cholesterol, triglycerides and total cholesterol

replication of the novel pleiotropic loci
in total, we sought replication for  <dig> potential novel snps for crp in  <dig>  genotyped individuals from three independent cohort studies. using a bonferroni corrected threshold for multiple testing , three snps remained significantly associated with crp levels when we performed replication analysis . these variants included the snps rs <dig> in ctsb/fdft <dig> , rs <dig> near fto  and rs <dig> near stag <dig> .

we aimed replication for  <dig> potential novel snps for lipids  in an in silico analysis including  <dig>  individuals. we could significantly replicate  <dig> variants for ldl-cholesterol , three for hdl-cholesterol , one for triglycerides  and one for total cholesterol  .

expression quantitative trait loci 
to annotate the effect of the replicated pleiotropic variants to the expression level of nearby genes, we investigated the association between the pleiotropic variants and gene expression levels in three different tissues relevant to crp and lipids by use of large publicly available datasets: whole blood   <cit> , liver  and adipose tissue  <cit>  . for the replicated pleiotropic variant rs <dig> near ctsb and fdft <dig>  we observed significant associations in whole blood with expression levels of two genes: ctsb itself , and fdft <dig> . in addition, the snp rs <dig> near stag <dig> and pccb was strongly associated with expression of the gene pccb in whole blood . no eqtl effect was observed in the liver and adipose tissue.

discussion
we identified fifty potential pleiotropic snps which affect both crp and lipid levels, of which we replicated three novel crp variants: rs <dig> , rs <dig>  and rs <dig> . in silico expression analyses suggested a role for rs <dig> in the gene expression of both ctsb and fdft <dig> and rs <dig> appeared to have an effect on the gene expression of pccb.

the locus harboring rs <dig> near ctsb and fdft <dig> that was identified for crp in our study has previously been identified for triglycerides in the joint analysis of the global lipids genetics consortium combining gwas data with metabochip association results  <cit> . we observed a significant effect of rs <dig> on the expression of both ctsb and fdft <dig>  the effect of the crp increasing allele  was weakly associated with a decrease in the expression of ctsb, whilst we observed a strong association of the t-allele with an increase of fdft <dig> gene expression. fdft <dig> encodes the enzyme squalene synthase which is involved in the cholesterol biosynthesis  <cit> . apart from lipids, fdft <dig> has been identified in a gwas on fatty liver disease  <cit> . squalene synthase inhibitors  have been developed and are successful in the reduction of cholesterol levels as well as crp levels  <cit> . this pleiotropic effect of cholesterol synthesis blockers on both lipid levels and inflammation is thought to be the consequence of altered isoprenoids levels that may activate pro-inflammatory pathways  <cit> . the observation that the crp increasing allele is associated with an increase in fdft <dig> gene expression suggests an effect of rs <dig> on serum crp through fdft <dig>  however, we searched in large databases to identify robust eqtl effects of the novel variants. therefore, we were unable to test the association between the expression and crp and we cannot draw a firm conclusion on the causal effect of the gene expression in the association between the genetic variant and crp.

we identified the snp rs <dig>  as a pleiotropic variant for hdl-cholesterol and crp. we confirmed the effect of rs <dig> on serum crp in an independent set of individuals and this genomic region has been identified in a gwas of lipids  <cit> . the snp rs <dig> is located within stag <dig>  but has a strong effect on the expression of pccb, located ±300 kb downstream of rs <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  pccb has been identified in a gwas of the protein fibrinogen, an acute phase response protein sharing many genes with crp  <cit> . our results provide further evidence that the pccb gene is involved in inflammation.

we identified the fto gene as a pleiotropic locus for crp and hdl-cholesterol. the a allele of rs <dig> was associated with an increase of crp and a decrease in hdl cholesterol. in several gwas on bmi, the a allele of rs <dig> was also associated with an increase in bmi  <cit> . previous studies have highlighted the causal effect of obesity on inflammation  <cit> , and the effect directions are consistent with mediation of both the association with crp and hdl-cholesterol by bmi. we have previously shown that the effect of fto on crp is indeed mediated through bmi  <cit> . further research is needed to demonstrate whether this is also true for hdl-cholesterol. our results provide further evidence for the role of obesity in inflammation and highlight the pleiotropic effects of the fto locus on both chronic inflammation and lipid metabolism.

genetic pleiotropy can be divided in biological and mediated pleiotropy  <cit> . in biological pleiotropy, the effect of the pleiotropic variant on two or more phenotypes is independent. in mediated pleiotropy, one phenotype mediates the association between the genetic variant and the second phenotype. both biological and mediated pleiotropic effects may occur for crp and lipids  <cit> . in the current study, we did not disentangle the different subtypes of pleiotropy. moreover, we observed pleiotropic variants with an opposite direction of effect than expected based on the phenotypical correlation in observational epidemiological studies. in biological pleiotropy, opposite directions of effect may occur. as an example, although crp and ldl-cholesterol are positively associated in observational epidemiological studies, the a-allele of the snp rs <dig>  is associated with lower crp levels but higher ldl-cholesterol. opposite direction of effects are often seen in genetic studies and highlight the complex interplay between correlated phenotypes, in our study crp and lipids  <cit> . we did not disentangle the different subtypes of pleiotropy, which is a limitation of the current study.

our study has certain strengths. we add to previous studies showing that the multivariate method we applied can be effectively utilized to identify potential novel and pleiotropic loci. this method only requires gwas summary data instead of individual level data from all participating cohorts. thanks to close collaboration between studies across the world, researchers have performed large gwas meta-analyses for a vast amount of phenotypes and this data is available for further research. second, we used the largest gwas meta-analyses that have so far been done on crp and lipid levels to identify pleiotropic genetic loci. by doing so, we enhanced the statistical power to detect these loci considerably. third, we provided robust evidence for three novel crp loci by replication in an independent sample of genotyped individuals. a limitation of the bivariate meta-analysis is that very strong signals in one of the individual traits may overshadow the weak association with the other phenotype. we set a criterion for the univariate p-values < <dig>  to minimize the chance of false positive findings. in many instances the effect of the pleiotropic loci on crp or lipids is very small. we did not replicate all our pleiotropic loci. this could be due to lack of power in the replication. in concordance, we replicated a larger proportion of the lipid variants in the larger lipid replication sample compared to crp. also, variants closer to significance did replicate in the replication study of both crp and lipids. also, several variants had substantial heterogeneity i <dig> in the replication which lowers the power for replication. furthermore, the replication sample size was for some variants smaller than  <dig>  due to absence of the variants in one or more of the replication studies. however, we cannot rule out the possibility that bivariate p-values are driven by strong associations with one of the phenotypes and produce false positive results. in addition, for the replication of the lipid variants, we used the metabochip results from the glgc. several variants selected for replication were not present on the metabochip. although we selected the best available proxy snp for replication, variants in moderate ld may have limited power for replication. the method used in the current manuscript to prioritize variants with pleiotropic effects among inflammation and cholesterol are hypothesis generating and further functional work regarding the role of the identified variants in cholesterol metabolism and inflammation is necessary.

CONCLUSIONS
our results provide evidence for substantial overlap in genetic susceptibility for chronic inflammation and lipid metabolism. in addition, through bivariate genome-wide association studies and replication in an independent sample of individuals we could identify novel genes for crp.
