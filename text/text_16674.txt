BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen frequently emerging from the mucosa-associated intestinal microbiota, which can cause severe septicemia in immuno-compromised hosts. several interaction mechanisms of p. aeruginosa with intestinal epithelial cells , especially adhesion and penetration, have been studied in detail  <cit> . conversely, little attention has been given to other species of the same genus, like pseudomonas fluorescens.

pseudomonas fluorescens has long been considered as a psychrotrophic microorganism, unable to grow at temperatures over 32°c, however we have recently shown that some strains isolated from a clinical environment are able to grow at or above 37°c  <cit> . p. fluorescens is a widespread gram-negative bacterium present in a variety of ecological niches such as refrigerated food products, soil, water  <cit>  and in the digestive tract  <cit> . interestingly, a highly specific antigen of p. fluorescens, designated as i <dig>  was detected in the serum of 54% of the patients suffering from ileal crohn's disease   <cit>  and a direct link between the severity of the pathology and the level of circulating i <dig> antigen has been demonstrated  <cit> . surprisingly, the proinflammatory potential of this bacterium or its interaction with the intestinal epithelium has never been investigated.

several studies have focused on the mucosal immune response to pathogenic bacteria. human iecs infected with pathogenic bacteria generally produce proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin - <dig>  <cit> . the latter has a chemotactic role and can recruit polymorphonuclear cells into the infected site and promote their infiltration of the epithelial layer infected by invasive or noninvasive bacteria  <cit> . il- <dig> gene expression is regulated by two major transcriptional factors: nuclear factor kappa b  and activator protein - <dig>  <cit> . nf-κb has a pivotal role in the immune and inflammatory response, but also controls cell survival, proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . recent works demonstrated that nf-κb signaling is a critical element of the homeostatic immuno-inflammatory function in the gut. indeed, epithelial nf-κb preserves the integrity of the gut epithelial barrier and coordinates the antimicrobial actions of the innate and adaptive immune systems  <cit> . nevertheless, hyperactivation of this transcription factor results in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases  <cit> . activation of ap- <dig> is dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinases  that are central in many physiological processes, including regulation of cytokine and stress responses and cytoskeletal reorganization  <cit> .

p. fluorescens mfn <dig> is a clinical strain recently isolated in our laboratory  <cit> . it displays hemolytic activity toward sheep erythrocytes  <cit> , however, its infectious potential on human iecs is still unknown.

in the present study, we investigated adhesion and cytotoxic properties of p. fluorescens mfn <dig> on caco-2/tc <dig> and ht- <dig> cell lines in comparison to the psychrotrophic strain, p. fluorescens mf <dig> and the well-known opportunist pathogen p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  the proinflammatory potential of p. fluorescens mfn <dig> was also evaluated by the measurement of il- <dig> secretion on both caco-2/tc <dig> and ht- <dig> cells, and analysis of nf-κb and ap- <dig> activation using the reporter gene strategy.

RESULTS
adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells
the binding index of the clinical strain p. fluorescens mfn <dig> on caco-2/tc <dig> and ht- <dig> cells was determined after  <dig> h of incubation and compared to p. fluorescens mf <dig> and p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  the data presented in figure  <dig> show that these bacterial strains adhere to both cell lines but the binding index was higher for caco-2/tc <dig>  than for ht- <dig> .

p. aeruginosa pao <dig> showed the highest adhesion potential on caco-2/tc <dig> cells compared to p. fluorescens mf <dig> and p. fluorescens mfn <dig>  when the cells were infected with a  <dig> cfu or  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> bacterial solution, the mean adhesion index of p. aeruginosa pao <dig> reached  <dig>  ±  <dig>  or  <dig>  ±  <dig>  bacteria cell- <dig>  respectively, whereas the adhesion of p. fluorescens was quite similar for the two strains with  <dig>  ±  <dig>  or  <dig>  ±  <dig>  bacteria cell- <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  or  <dig>  ±  <dig> bacteria cell- <dig> for mf <dig> and mfn <dig>  respectively.

the same experiment using ht- <dig> cells showed that the binding index of p. aeruginosa pao <dig> remained the highest  but the index of p. fluorescens mfn <dig>  was significantly higher than that of mf <dig> .

cytotoxicity assay
the cytotoxic effect of pseudomonas strains on caco-2/tc <dig> and ht- <dig> cells was determined by quantification of lactate dehydrogenase  released in culture medium .

p. fluorescens mf <dig> exhibited the lowest cytotoxic activity  with only  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  or  <dig> ±  <dig> %  of cell lysis after  <dig> h of infection on caco-2/tc <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  or  <dig> ±  <dig> %  of cell lysis for ht- <dig> cells . the cytotoxicity of mfn <dig> was higher with  <dig> ±  <dig> % or  <dig>  ±  <dig> % lysis for infection respectively with  <dig> or  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> on caco-2/tc <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  or  <dig>  ±  <dig> % lysis after infection with  <dig> or  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> respectively on ht- <dig>  p. aeruginosa pao <dig> led to a total lysis of caco-2/tc <dig> at the two bacterial concentrations tested and on ht- <dig>  with infection rates of  <dig> or  <dig> cfu ml- <dig>  ldh release was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % or  <dig>  ±  <dig> % respectively. at the end of infection, caco-2/tc <dig> and ht- <dig> cells were observed by light microscopy. figure  <dig> shows the cell monolayers after infection with moi of  <dig> . when caco-2/tc <dig> cells where infected with p. fluorescens mf <dig>  a slight cell detachment was detectable while more cells were detaching after infection with mfn <dig>  infection with p. aeruginosa pao <dig> led to a complete disappearance of the organized caco-2/tc <dig> and ht- <dig> monolayers.

induction of il- <dig> secretion
the bacterial proinflammatory effect was assessed by measuring il- <dig> secretion. compared to untreated cells, the three pseudomonas strains induced significant stimulation of il- <dig> secretion in both caco-2/tc <dig>  and ht- <dig> cells . mean values of il- <dig> on ht- <dig> and caco- <dig> in response to p. fluorescens mf <dig> and mfn <dig> were similar for these two strains and it is noteworthy that il- <dig> secretion was significantly increased in ht- <dig> compared to caco- <dig> cells.

nf-κb and ap- <dig> activation in caco- <dig> and ht- <dig> reporter cell lines
to further explore the immuno-modulatory properties of p. fluorescens mfn <dig>  we tested the effects of this bacterium on nf-κb or ap- <dig> activation using caco- <dig> and ht- <dig> reporter cell lines. we observed that p. aeruginosa pao <dig> stimulated nf-κb activity by  <dig> -fold over control in both caco-2/κb-seap- <dig> and ht-29/κb-seap- <dig> reporter clones  while it had no effect on the ap- <dig> pathway . interestingly, p. fluorescens mf <dig> and mfn <dig> had an opposite effect. indeed, none of these strains induced nf-κb activation  whereas they both activated the ap- <dig> pathway by  <dig> -fold over control in caco-2/ap1-luc- <dig> and ht-29/ap1-luc- <dig> reporter clones .

discussion
p. fluorescens is present at low level in the human gut and has been linked to crohn's disease   <cit> , however little is known about the potential interaction of this bacterium with the intestinal mucosa. in the present paper, we aimed at determining its potential to adhere to iec, to induce cell cytotoxicity and trigger a proinflammatory response. we selected two strains, a classical psychrotrophic strain  and a recently characterized clinical strain adapted to grow at 37°c . the behaviour of these bacteria was compared to that of the opportunistic pathogen p. aeruginosa.

since adhesion and cytotoxicity to iecs are crucial events in the infection process, the three strains were tested on two epithelial cell lines. except for adhesion, the two iecs models used in this study gave similar responses to the three strains of pseudomonas. indeed, a dose dependent adhesion of bacteria to caco-2/tc <dig> and ht- <dig> cells was observed with the greatest effect obtained with the opportunistic pathogen p. aeruginosa. it is noteworthy that, compared to the psychrotrophic strain mf <dig>  the clinical strain p. fluorescens mfn <dig>  which is adapted to develop at 37°c displayed statistically significant higher adhesion potential to ht- <dig> but not to caco-2/tc <dig> cells. this observation suggests that the clinical strain may express a greater diversity of adhesion factors than mf <dig> and could explain, at least in part, the higher cytotoxicity effect of mfn <dig> 

although differences exist between surface proteins expressed by caco-2/tc <dig> and ht- <dig> cell lines in comparison to normal human iecs, our results support the hypothesis that p. fluorescens should be able to colonize the intestinal mucosa. pseudomonad are rarely searched for and detected as fecal bacteria, and are usually considered as a sub-dominant population  <cit> . in addition, there is now ample evidence that the circulating bacterial population in the intestinal lumen is very different from the resident microbiota that comes in contact with the apical surface of the enterocytes and is tightly associated to the mucus/glycocalyx layer  <cit> . for an aerobic bacterium such as p. fluorescens, the best ecological niche should be at the vicinity of the epithelium, where oxygen concentration is the highest in the intestinal environment  <cit> . this is supported by the evidence showing that the p. fluorescens-specific i <dig> antigen sequence is systematically detected in ileal mucosa samples  <cit> . moreover, in cd patients, there is a positive correlation between blood level of circulating anti-i <dig> antibodies and the severity of the disease  <cit>  suggesting that the i2-producing bacteria, i.e. p. fluorescens, are in close contact with enterocytes and could contribute to cd pathogenesis.

the ldh release assay showed that the cytotoxicity of p. fluorescens on caco-2/tc <dig> and ht- <dig> cells is lower than that of p. aeruginosa. this limited virulence of the p. fluorescens strains seems to be normal for a species that should be a resident in the intestine whereas p. aeruginosa is typically an opportunistic pathogen only detected in case of declared infection  <cit> . this hypothesis is also in agreement with the hierarchy of the cytotoxic activity of the two tested strains of p. fluorescens, the clinical strain mfn <dig> being more virulent than the environmental and psychrotrophic strain mf <dig>  bacterial cytotoxicity is a highly complex phenomenon combining the virulence of the prokaryote and the intrinsic sensitivity of the eukaryotic cell. in opposition to the present results, chapalain et al found that the cytotoxic activity on glial cells was higher for p. fluorescens mf <dig> than mfn <dig>  <cit> . these observations are in agreement with the work of picot et al showing that in the case of p. fluorescens, the necrotic and apoptotic activities are not simply correlated to the adhesion potential of the strain  <cit> .

in contrast to p. aeruginosa, the proinflammatory effect of p. fluorescens strains has not been elucidated. in this study, we demonstrated that similarly to p. aeruginosa, p. fluorescens mfn <dig> and mf <dig> exerted a direct proinflammatory effect on iecs as demonstrated by induction of il- <dig> secretion. the homogenous proinflammatory response of iecs induced by the two p. fluorescens strains studied suggests a link between the proinflammatory properties and a common pathogenic factor of these strains. il- <dig> gene expression is regulated by several signaling pathways including mainly nf-κb and ap- <dig> transcription factors. previous studies have shown that p. aeruginosa activates nf-κb in mouse monocyte/macrophage cell line  <cit>  and mapk signaling pathways in lung epithelial cells  <cit> , which in turn leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnf-α . in our study, the two p. fluorescens strains failed to activate the nf-κb pathway in contrast to p. aeruginosa, however the two strains were able to activate ap- <dig> signaling, suggesting that the proinflammatory effect of these bacteria in iecs is linked to the activation of mapk signaling pathways. the mapk form a group of three pathways, including extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases  and two stress-activated protein kinases designated p <dig> and jnk   <cit> . the activation of mapk has been reported to be involved in response to infection by invasive bacteria, such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium or listeria monocytogenes, in iecs  <cit>  or in macrophages  <cit> . moreover, it has been shown that enteroadherent escherichia coli activate this pathway and both bacterial attachment and secreted proteins might be implicated in cytokine responses  <cit> . p. aeruginosa as well as p. fluorescens contain multiple cell surface factors, including flagellin, pili, lps, type iii-mediated toxin secretion and quorum-sensing molecules which could interact with distinct epithelial membrane proteins, such as asialylated glycolipid receptors, toll like receptors , or combinations of these proteins  <cit> . we have shown that purified flagellin strongly activated nf-κb pathway in ht- <dig> and to a lower extent in caco- <dig>  whereas both cell lines poorly responded to lps . in contrast, purified flagellin and lps do not activated the ap- <dig> pathway in the two cell lines . thus, we can conclude that p. fluorescens activated ap- <dig> pathway in caco- <dig> and ht- <dig> independently of flagellin and lps expression. further investigations will be needed to identify the exact nature and function of p. fluorescens compounds responsible for mapk activation in iecs.

CONCLUSIONS
p. fluorescens mfn <dig>  p. fluorescens mf <dig> and p. aeruginosa pao <dig> were found to adhere to caco-2/tc <dig> and ht- <dig> cells and the cytotoxicity towards these cell lines was higher for the clinical strain mfn <dig> than for mf <dig>  we showed that the two strains of p. fluorescens induced il- <dig> secretion by caco-2/tc <dig> and ht- <dig> cells via the ap- <dig> signaling pathway whereas p. aeruginosa pao <dig> potentially used the nf-κb pathway. to our knowledge, this work is the first to demonstrate the interaction and the proinflammatory potential of p. fluorescens on iecs.
