BACKGROUND
grapevine  was domesticated in the
neolithic period   <cit>  from wild populations of vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris <cit> . archaeological data traced back the location of the earliest evidence for
large-scale winemaking, likely linked to the use of domesticated plants, to the north of
zagros mountains and in the caucasian region  <cit>  around 6000– <dig> bc which supports that geographic area as the location
for primo domestication events. from there, grapevine cuttings were widely spread: first
from north to south; and later from east to west around the mediterranean basin pathway  <cit> . vegetative propagation and dissemination, spontaneous events of
hybridization among cultivars, breeding with local wild plants and likely secondary
domestication events generated the pattern of admixture that is observed in current
cultivars  <cit> – <cit> . the use of different genetic pools along the process of grapevine
domestication and human selection for different uses such as fresh consumption, raisin
or wine production have resulted in large variation for cluster size, compactness and
architecture among cultivars from different geographic locations  <cit> .

the size and shape of grapevine clusters is determined by the development and growth of
inflorescences as well as the efficiency of pollination, fruit set and berry growth.
generally, wine grape cultivars present small  and compact clusters with
small berries, while table grapes generally have large  and less compact
clusters with large berries. some of them can even be extremely big weighting up to
1000-1500 g  <cit> . negrul  <cit>  distinguished different grape morphotypes based in part on cluster and berry
traits. cluster architecture has implications on disease susceptibility, since cultivars
with compact clusters are more susceptible to rot by botrytis cinerea than
those of loose clusters  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . in spite of the relevance of cluster structure and compactness, very little
is known about its genetic control probably due in part to the complexity of the trait,
which depends on many different variables along the growth of the plant as well as the
environmental interactions during its reproductive development. there is a need to
define cluster shape and size in terms of quantitative variables to understand its
genetic determination. so far, only a few studies have tried to identify the main
variables responsible for variation in bunch compactness in grapevine. in this sense,
vail and marois  <cit>  identified cluster weight as the main factor to explain its variation while
shavrukov et al.  <cit>  proposed total cluster length and node number per rachis as two of the main
ones. recently, tello and ibañez  <cit>  evaluated  <dig> indexes to estimate cluster compactness highlighting the role of
various cluster parameters such as branch length and number. the study proposed a fast
and good estimator for cluster compactness based on cluster weight and length.

genetic and molecular analyses in model plants, such as arabidopsis thaliana,
demonstrated the interaction between terminal flower  <dig>  and
leafy   <cit> , <cit>  in the establishment of inflorescence architecture. their interactions
supported a simple model explaining the evolution of plants inflorescence architecture  <cit> . tfl <dig> belongs to a small gene family first identified in mammals as
encoding phosphatidyl ethanolamine-binding proteins   <cit> , which participates in a wide variety of biological functions in eukaryotes.
in arabidopsis, tfl <dig> has been shown to function in the transcriptional
repression of flower meristem identity genes  <cit> . lfy encodes a plant specific transcription factor  <cit> , which serves as a flower meristem identity regulator activating the
transcription of other flower meristem identity genes  <cit> . recently, the existence of a common genetic pathway controlling
inflorescence architecture in arabidopsis and rice has been demonstrated
indicating that this pathway could be highly conserved in angiosperms  <cit> . following this report, four mads-box genes are required to suppress
tfl <dig> in emerging floral meristems; what seems to be indispensable to
initiate their differentiation.

in grapevine, the family of pebp encoding genes includes at least five genes; three of
them have deduced protein sequences related to arabidopsis tfl <dig>  being
vvtfl1a the closest homologous sequence  <cit> . in fact, over-expression of vvtfl1a in transgenic arabidopsis
plants generates phenotypes of large and late flowering inflorescences reminding those
observed when over-expressing the endogenous arabidopsis gene  <cit> . likewise, recent findings show that the extreme cluster proliferation and
delayed anthesis observed in the reiterated reproductive meristems  somatic variant
of grapevine cultivar carignan was caused by a single dominant mutation in the
vvtfl1a gene. this dominant mutation was identified as the insertion of a
class ii transposable element, hatvine1-rrm, in the vvtfl1a promoter,
triggering up-regulation of the corresponding vvtfl1a allele in reproductive
and vegetative organs of the shoot apex  <cit> . these results suggested a role for vvtfl1a in the determination of
inflorescence structure as well as on the branching pattern of the grapevine fruit
clusters and the time of anthesis.

to further analyze the contribution of vvtfl1a to the phenotypic variation
observed for reproductive and inflorescence traits in grapevine, the nucleotide
diversity shown by this gene in a core collection of grapevine accessions was analysed
and a candidate gene association approach on the variation observed for fertility index,
phenological variables as well as several inflorescence and berry related traits was
carried out. herein the identification of vvtfl1a sequence polymorphisms
associated with flowering and cluster traits is reported, being the most relevant ones
corresponding to several indels in two intron regions. these indels are in ld with
additional snps defining three ld blocks, which correspond to three major haplogroups.
interestingly, these haplogroups are characteristic of either wine or table cultivars in
agreement with the cluster and flowering phenotype to which they are associated to.

methods
plant material
the plant material consisted of  <dig> grapevine cultivars corresponding to a core
collection of vitis vinifera l. subsp. vinifera intended to
maximize agro-morphological diversity for  <dig> qualitative and quantitative traits  <cit> . all the cultivars are maintained at the inra experimental station of
domaine de vassal, marseillan-plage, france
. the list of cultivars,
pedigree when available, classification according to use ,
geographical group according to bacilieri et al.  <cit> , lacombe et al.  <cit>  and available data of the vitis international variety catalogue
 are shown in additional file  <dig>  classification according to eastern and western origin was obtained
considering cultivars from the iberian peninsula , western and central europe
 and the italian peninsula  as occidental cultivars; whereas cultivars
from the balkans , russia and ukraine , eastern mediterranean and
caucasus , middle and far east  were considered as oriental cultivars.
for newly bred grape varieties, their pedigree was used to assess western or eastern
origin to classify them according to their genetic origin and not according to
breeding location. when genetic origin of pedigree was questionable, the cultivar was
considered to present mixed origin.

phenotypic evaluation
ten morphological traits related to the reproductive biology of grapevine were
considered in this study. among them, four were related to phenology ; one to yield ; and
five to berry and cluster features . cluster compactness was estimated from available data such as
  <cit> . principal component analysis separated on axis  <dig> phenological traits from
cluster size traits being fertility index opposite to all other traits on axis 1
. strongest correlations were found
between maturity and veraison time  as
well as between cluster weight and width . all
traits were scored at the domaine de vassal and were expressed as the mean value for
five plants per accession analysed a maximum of three years following the recommended
oiv descriptors as shown in table  <dig> <cit> . details of phenotypic values obtained for each cultivar are given in
additional file  <dig>  the phenotype distribution for these
traits within the core collection is provided in additional file  <dig> 

genotyping
for each genotype,  <dig>  kb of the vvtfl1a gene  were amplified and sequenced using primers
listed in fernandez et al.  <cit> . dna was extracted from young leaves of each genotype as described in
adam-blondon et al.  <cit> . amplifications were carried out using taq dna polymerase  as
recommended by manufacturer. pcr products were treated with exosap-it reagent as
recommended by manufacturer and sequenced at the genomic service of the parque
cientifico de madrid in an abi prism  <dig>  dna sequencer. base
calling, quality trimming and alignment of abi chromatograms was performed using
seqscape v <dig>  . sequence polymorphisms were manually verified to
establish genotypes. the nomenclature system used to name polymorphisms corresponded
to letters followed by numbers: single letter correspond to the involved nucleotide
substitution using the iub’s conventional nomenclature and “ins” is
used to designed indel; positive or negative numbers corresponded to polymorphism
position from the first base of the “atg start codon”. linkage
disequilibrium  calculations between polymorphisms were carried out using the ld
option implemented in tassel v. <dig>   <cit> .

molecular diversity parameter estimates were calculated using dnasp v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . per site nucleotide diversity   <cit> , watterson θ estimate  <cit>  and tajima’s d  <cit>  were calculated for the whole haplotype set and separately for the three
structured sub-populations .

association tests
knowing that population structure can bias association studies, the structured
association  method  <cit>  and the mixed linear model mlm  <cit>  were used to reduce false positives. population structure of the core
collection was determined using  <dig> ssr markers well scattered throughout the  <dig> grape
linkage groups   <cit>  by a bayesian clustering implemented in structure v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the admixture model was applied assuming that segregation of alleles was
independent. a burn-in period of  <dig>  followed by  <dig>  markov chain monte carlo
 iterations with  <dig> replicate runs were carried out for each value of population
structure tested . the optimal
sub-population model was selected with the maximal likelihood
k =  <dig> according to the Δk method  <cit>  and later corrections for Δk artefacts  <cit> . the corresponding q-matrix was used for structured association tests. an
arbitrary cut-off value of 50% ancestry was set to assign each individual to one of
the three sub-population clusters .
individuals not assigned in one sub-population were considered as admixed. this
structure discriminates cultivars according to their use and geographic origin with
k <dig> mainly constituted by western wine cultivars , k <dig> by eastern table cultivars
 and k <dig> composed by eastern and western wine cultivars and table cultivars
. the kinship matrix was calculated on the
basis of the same set of ssr markers  <cit>  using tassel v. <dig> .
v.vinifera
core collection. schematic representation of estimated membership was
obtained using structure and classification of the individuals to one of the
three genetic groups  was obtained using 50% of ancestry.
geographic origin  and fruit use  of each cultivar are
indicated using colour codes.

comparison of the naïve general linear model  test, the structured
association test  and the structured mixed linear model  using tassel
v. <dig> identified the last one as the most conservative model and was therefore selected
to perform the association tests. mlm-q association tests were carried out using the
r v. <dig>   <cit>  and tassel v. <dig> software. polymorphic sites carrying rare alleles
 and unbalanced genotypic classes
 were discarded to avoid biased
associations. rare genotypic classes were in this last case replaced by missing data.
polymorphisms were codified to test both additive and dominant effects using r to be
similar with marker model tested using tassel. for traits showing significant
associations after bonferroni correction  using
either tassel or r, multi-locus mixed-models using forward-backward stepwise
regression  were implemented using the r software to identify major
non-redundant associated markers  <cit> . population structure and kinship were both included in the multi-locus
analysis. best models were selected according to the extended bayesian information
criteria  and the multiple bonferroni criteria  according to segura et
al.  <cit> .

haplotype reconstruction and networks
as v. vinifera genotypes are generally highly heterozygous  <cit> , the unphased genotypic dataset was analysed to identify the succession of
linked polymorphisms along the sequenced dna region. haplotypes were reconstructed
using a plem algorithm  <cit>  implemented in phase v <dig>  applying default values of the iterative scheme  <cit> . reconstructed haplotypes were submitted separately and simultaneously to
three recombination detection tests implemented in the recombination detection
program v3beta <dig>  <cit> . those were the maxchi method with a window size of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or 30
variables sites  <cit> , the chimaera method with a window size of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> variables
sites  <cit>  and the 3seq method  <cit> . to ensure consistency, haplotypes showing a significant probability of
being the result of recombination  in at least two tests were
considered as recombinants and excluded from further analysis as previously done by
fournier-level et al.  <cit> .

network analysis was carried out using the median-joining method  <cit>  implemented in network v <dig> . <dig>   and
fixing a weight of  <dig> for the polymorphisms showing best associations with traits
. three haplogroups hga, hgb and hgc were defined
according to the three ld blocks.

RESULTS
vvtfl1a structure and sequence polymorphisms
a total of 3646 bp of the vvtfl1a gene corresponding to 2442 bp
and 1204 bp before and after atg, respectively, were sequenced in all the
individuals of the core collection. translation of coding sequences identified the
annotated four exons in the v. vinifera pn <dig> genome sequence  <cit>  of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 218 bp and three introns of  <dig>   <dig> and
107 bp . nucleotide sequence analyses
enabled the identification of  <dig> polymorphisms . among them,  <dig> polymorphisms were located in the promoter sequence,
 <dig> in the 5’ untranslated region, and  <dig> and  <dig> polymorphisms were located in
exonic and intronic regions, respectively. indel ins- <dig> and ins- <dig>  located in
the promoter, and ins <dig> in intron  <dig>  involved  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides, respectively;
whereas ins- <dig> and ins- <dig> in the promoter, and ins <dig> in intron  <dig> represented
microsatellite variations with ins <dig> being biallelic and the other two multiallelic
. out of the five exonic snp, only three
 caused non-synonymous amino acid substitutions and are shown
in figure 2a. among the  <dig> polymorphisms,  <dig>  were
represented by a rare allele , with  <dig> of them grouped between
position − <dig> and − <dig> before atg. the complete genotypic data set is

vvtfl1a nucleotide diversity
a total of  <dig> haplotypes, including  <dig> singletons, were identified based on phase
reconstruction using the  <dig> segregating polymorphisms . genetic diversity of vvtfl1a gene was estimated in
terms of number of segregating sites  and polymorphism  for all
the haplotypes and according to population structure. comparison of genetic diversity
index among the  <dig> genetic groups inferred within the analysed core collection  indicated that despite k <dig> sub-population included a smaller
number of haplotypes than the two other k <dig> and k <dig> sub-populations; this presented a
high number of segregating sites and π and θ polymorphism indexes
. the tajima’s d-tests showed a
general neutral value considering all haplotypes and a slight but non-significant
negative value in k <dig> sub-population compared with k <dig> sub-population, which showed a
slight positive value . when tajima’s
d-test was estimated in sliding windows along vvtfl1a; the test
revealed a similar pattern of variation for k <dig> and k <dig> sub-populations with a general
negative value along vvtfl1a promoter .
in contrast, the value of d along the transcribed region in k3
sub-population increased to reach a positive value. in k <dig> sub-population,
tajima’s d-test showed general positive value in both promoter and
transcribed regions. these patterns indicated different selection or demographic
events between haplotypes within the three genetic groups.

vvtfl1a haplotypes
in order to study relationship between vvtfl1a haplotypes, those likely
resulting from recombinant events were detected to avoid bias. among the 62
haplotypes originally identified,  <dig> were considered recombinants  and were removed for haplotype network analysis.
haplotype network was constructed using  <dig> non-recombinant haplotypes that included
 <dig> singletons. haplotype network discriminated three groups of closely related
haplotypes or haplogroups , which were clearly structured in
relation with mutations in linkage disequilibrium  . within hga major part of the haplotypes  were present in
cultivars of the k <dig> sub-population including eastern and western cultivars used as
table and wine grapes. the remaining haplotypes of hga were similarly found in
cultivars of the k <dig> and k <dig> sub-population . regarding hgb
and hgc 52% and 68% of their haplotypes were detected in cultivars of the k2
sub-population mainly represented by western wine cultivars .
of
vvtfl1a
. network analysis was carried for haplotypes identified for 70
polymorphic sites in the vvtfl1a gene excluding recombined haplotypes.
haplotypes are represented by circles with circle size proportional to
haplotype frequency . the haplotypes colours relate to the accessions
classification according to according to structured genetic groups . black dots represent mutational steps.
colour lines represent the mutations in ld that separated the three haplogroups
identified .

haplotypes  <dig> and  <dig> were the most frequent  and belonged to hga and hgb,
respectively. most of the cultivars of the core collection were heterozygous for two
different haplotypes  with 20% of them being heterozygous for a combination of
hga and hgb haplotypes . only 20
cultivars were homozygous  with eight and five varieties homozygous for hga and
hgb haplotypes, respectively. two cultivars were homozygous for haplotype  <dig> of hgc
and the remaining homozygous accessions presented putative recombinant
haplotypes.

regarding the recombinant haplotypes, haplotype  <dig>  which was the most frequent
, corresponded to a recombination between haplotypes
from hga and hgb . indeed, no allele
specifically assigned to hgc was present in this haplotype, which was always combined
with alleles typical of both hga and hgb haplotypes. interestingly; haplotype  <dig> was
present only in cultivars of k <dig>  and k <dig>  sub-populations classified mainly
as eastern table grapes, with two cultivars being homozygous for this haplotype
. furthermore, among the individuals
that presented at least one hgc haplotype mainly composed by cultivars of the k2
sub-population, the only one eastern table cultivar belonging to the k3
sub-population was a combination with haplotype  <dig> 

certainly, ld pattern along vvtfl1a gene revealed three main blocks of
linked polymorphisms : linked polymorphisms
specific of hga  located in the
promoter, the first and the third introns of vvtfl1a gene; linked
polymorphisms specific of hgb  identified in the distal promoter region and in the three
intron regions; and linked polymorphisms specific of hgc  located in the promoter and the
second intron of the vvtfl1a gene. thus, haplogroups hga, hgb, and hgc are
consistent with the existence of three ancestral alleles or evolutionary branches
supported by polymorphisms in the three ld blocks.

and utr by grey boxes. polymorphism classification into three ld blocks is

candidate gene association
considering the biological function established for the arabidopsis tfl1
gene as well as the phenological traits altered in the carignan rrm somatic variant,
the candidate gene association study was focused on those phenological and cluster
morphological traits that could be related with its putative biological function in
grapevine. association tests for vvtfl1a gene were run between the 38
polymorphisms showing minor allele frequency ≥5% and each phenotypic trait.
rare genotyping classes  were excluded from the association tests. out of
the  <dig> polymorphisms, only  <dig> presented significant associations  using either r or tassel with flowering time, berry
weight and cluster width .

the strongest association was found between berry weight and snp m-196
 explaining 16% of the trait
variation. the highest association for flowering time and cluster width was found
with ins <dig>  that explained 10%
and 13% of trait variation, respectively. interestingly, ins <dig> characteristic of hga
also associated significantly  with berry weight
. at a lesser extent, ins422
from hgc associated with the three traits explaining 9%, 6% and 7% of flowering time,
berry weight and cluster width variations, respectively.

in order to determine whether the different associations detected were only due to ld
or were the result of the particular effect of each polymorphism, the multi-locus
mixed-model analysis was carried out. flowering time showed the strongest
associations with polymorphisms characteristic of hga and hgc under single-locus
approaches . in the multi-locus analysis, the
best models to explain flowering time variation identified one and two polymorphisms
based on optimal mbonf and ebic criteria, respectively . the optimal models included ins <dig> from hga specific ld block and
w <dig> without ld with other polymorphisms and explained up to 16% of flowering time
variation. association between w <dig> and flowering time was not identified with the
single-locus approach; the use of ins <dig> as covariate in the model revealed w1087
association. the remaining markers, not included in the model, had minor and/or
redundant effects with those ones. similarly, the best models explaining up to 25% of
berry weight variation included m- <dig> and ins <dig> in agreement with the highest
associations detected with the single-locus approach. instead, cluster width
variation showing associations with polymorphisms within the three ld blocks under
single-locus approaches was only explained by polymorphism ins <dig>  after the
multi-locus mixed-model analysis. the effect of polymorphisms characteristic of hgb
was minor and redundant with those of ins <dig>  therefore, in addition to its high
association  in single-locus analyses with three traits
, ins <dig> was selected in the three
best multi-locus models explaining the variation of those traits. besides, ins883
explains alone cluster width variation. these results highlight the major influence
of indel ins <dig> in the possible role of vvtfl1a on phenology and cluster
traits.

the models presented corresponded to the optimal models, i.e., optimizing
ebic and mbonf criteria. r <dig> markers = variance explained by
polymorphisms in each model, r <dig> model = cumulative variance
explained by markers and genetic variance .

phenotypic values related to major haplotypes
based on haplotype network and association results, two molecular polymorphisms
 were selected that discriminated the three haplogroups 6-ins4227; hgb:
ins8835-ins4227; hgc:
ins8835-ins4228). the  <dig> allele of
ins <dig> was associated with late flowering time, high berry weight and large cluster
width . all haplotypes in hga presented the
 <dig> allele, in contrast with haplotypes in hgb and hgc that contained
the  <dig> allele regarding ins <dig>  the  <dig> allele was
associated with early flowering time, low berry weight and small cluster width
. all haplotypes carrying the
 <dig> allele belonged to hgc, mainly represented by haplotype  <dig>  while
haplotypes in hga and hgb contained the  <dig> allele.

as other polymorphisms appeared associated with these phenotypic traits, the
phenotypic values were also analysed considering the three major haplotypes  <dig>   <dig> and
 <dig> from hga, b and c, respectively. as an average, individuals presenting at least
one haplotype  <dig> exhibited late flowering, big berries and large cluster clearly in
contrast to the phenotypic features of individuals containing at least one haplotype
 <dig> or  <dig> . this was more obvious when homozygous
individuals or heterozygous individuals for haplotypes  <dig> and  <dig> were taken into
account considering the absence of homozygous individuals for haplotype 60
. the phenotypic value for the more frequent
recombinant haplotype  <dig> found in eastern table cultivars was also analysed, which
presented the  <dig> allele at the major indel ins <dig> such as haplotypes of
hga. phenotypic values for flowering time, berry weight and cluster width for
haplotype  <dig> were slightly higher than those of individuals carrying haplotype 32

discussion
arabidopsis tfl <dig> plays a critical role in the specification of the
inflorescence meristem and inflorescence architecture  <cit> , <cit> . this role seems to be conserved in other plant species  <cit>  likely through a conserved regulatory pathway  <cit> . in grapevine, the previous identification of misexpression of the
arabidopsis homolog vvtfl1a as the molecular cause of the
reiteration of reproductive meristems  mutant  <cit> , also supported the possible conservation of its biological function in this
species in agreement with previous results  <cit> , <cit> . phenotypic characterization of the rrm plants showed that vvtfl1a
overexpression was related to a delay in the time of anthesis and to an increase in the
size and branching pattern of the inflorescences  <cit> , similar to the effects of tfl <dig> overexpression in transgenic
arabidopsis  <cit> . to provide additional evidence on the involvement of vvtfl1a in
natural variation for flowering time and inflorescence development and to identify
nucleotide sequence polymorphisms that could be partially responsible for those traits
in grapevine, a genetic diversity analysis of this gene sequence and genetic association
studies with those traits were carried out.

nucleotide variations for vvtfl1a in the grapevine core collection analysed is
relatively high with an average of one polymorphic site every  <dig> nucleotides. however,
only five out of the  <dig> polymorphisms detected are located in exonic regions and only
three of them result in non-synonymous amino acid substitutions. this result is in
agreement with the slight negative tajima’s d values observed along
vvtfl1a coding sequences and suggests that the protein structure admits few
variations. reduction in overall level of nucleotide variation was also reported for the
arabidopsis tfl <dig> gene when compared with other flowering genes  <cit> . among the three non-synonymous polymorphisms identified in vvtfl1a,
w <dig>  located in first exon, had a very low frequency and was not considered for the
association analyses. the two other, w <dig> and m <dig>  are located in the fourth exon in
a region of the protein responsible for the functional divergence between ft and tfl <dig>  <cit> ; although the substituted amino acids do not correspond to conserved residues  <cit>  and the snp did not associate with inflorescence related traits under
single-locus models. however, w <dig> was selected by the multi-locus mixed-model analysis
to explain part of flowering time variation together with ins <dig> suggesting a possible
functional effect of this snp in this trait. regarding the  <dig> polymorphisms found in
intron regions, two indel  showed significant association with
flowering and cluster trait variation. indel ins <dig> is located in intron  <dig> and
corresponds to a microsatellite sequence of ga repetitions; while indel ins <dig> is
located in intron  <dig> and corresponds to a g nucleotide repetition. the  <dig> remaining
vvtfl1a polymorphisms identified in the core collection were located
upstream of the translation start codon and included four indel. no traces of the
hatvine1-rrm transposon were detected in the promoter of vvtfl1a in
the whole core collection which demonstrates the specificity of the insertion event
causing the carignan rrm mutant phenotype  <cit> .

nucleotide polymorphisms in vvtfl1a ld blocks that discriminate the three
haplogroups displayed differential association with cluster traits under linear
regression models. among all traits analysed, polymorphic sites characteristic of hga
and hgc haplogroups explained part of the phenotypic variation for flowering time, berry
weight and cluster width. in the same way, polymorphisms specific of hgb associated with
cluster width as well as polymorphisms from hga. these results suggest that variation at
vvtfl1a has an effect on flowering time, berry weight and cluster width with
different alleles having differential effects on the traits. interestingly, both
flowering time delay and cluster width increase were observed in the phenotypic
characterization of the rrm somatic variant related to vvtfl1a overexpression.
unfortunately, berry size was not measured in that study  <cit> .

among all the polymorphic sites tested, insertion ins <dig> discriminating hga from hgb and
hgc explained alone part of flowering time, berry weight and cluster width variations.
according to the multi-locus analysis, ins <dig> explained up to 16%, 13% and 25% of
flowering time, cluster width and berry weight variation in the best models, being the
only polymorphism contributing to berry weight variation. indel occurring in
functionally important regions of genes could affect gene function, through gene
expression modification  <cit>  or rna structure alterations  <cit> . however, a preliminary vvtlf1a rt qpcr expression analysis carried
out in young inflorescences of the cultivars of the core collection did not reveal any
association between gene expression variation and the vvtfl1a polymorphisms
. likewise, no clear correlation  between
vvtfl1a expression and phenotypic traits was identified .
nevertheless, these negative results do not discard a possible role of this intron
sequences in transcriptional or posttranscriptional processes given the difficulties in
carrying out transcriptional comparisons among different genotypes with different
flowering behaviour. analysis of maize tfl <dig> homologs expression in different
tissues and developmental stages showed the existence of differential transcript
processing  <cit> . in fact, in a preliminary study, the existence of alternatively spliced rna
forms was detected for the first and the second introns of vvtfl1a . further research will be required to demonstrate any functional role of this
alternative splicing as well as its relationship with the described vvtfl1a
ins <dig> polymorphism. in any case, further association analyses using larger samples and
specific segregation analyses will be required to confirm the detected associations.

together with ins <dig>  m- <dig> and w <dig> without ld with other vvtfl1a
polymorphisms explain part of berry weight and flowering time variation according to
multi-locus analysis, respectively. in contrast to ins <dig> that discriminates haplotypes
of hga from those of hgb and hgc, m- <dig> and w <dig> corresponded to mutations
differentiating haplotypes within the hga haplogroup . the m- <dig> base change located in the proximal promoter and the w1087
non-synonymous substitution in the fourth exon of vvtfl1a might represent
relevant structural modifications at the promoter and the protein sequence,
respectively, likely affecting vvtfl1a function in a non-redundant way with
ins <dig>  moreover, in silico analysis using sift program
 predicts that substitution of t by s at position
 <dig> of the vvtfl1a sequence affects protein function with a score of  <dig>  based on the
alignment of  <dig> closely related sequences.

vvtfl1a haplotype network differentiates three haplogroups of closely related
haplotypes. each hg is represented by a high frequency haplotype, haplotypes  <dig> for hga,
 <dig> for hgb and haplotype  <dig> from hgc. consistent with the results of the association
analyses, individuals containing haplotype  <dig> of hga, exhibited late flowering, large
cluster width and larger berries. interestingly, most of the cultivars of k <dig> and k3
classified to table or table/wine uses, characterized by these phenotypic features  <cit> , present hga haplotypes. this relationship is also true for accessions
carrying the recombinant haplotype  <dig>  indeed, haplotype  <dig> contains ins <dig> insertion
present in hga haplotypes and mostly present in eastern table cultivars belonging to k1
and k <dig> genetic groups. the fact that cultivars carrying haplotype  <dig> display late
flowering, large cluster width and larger berries supports a clear relationship between
ins <dig> polymorphism and the eastern table cluster characteristics. in contrast,
individuals containing haplotype  <dig> of hgc with ins <dig> insertion exhibited early
flowering, shorter cluster width and smaller berries. consistently, hgc haplotypes are
enriched in western wine grape cultivars mostly belonging to k <dig> genetic group, which are
known to display those cluster and berry features  <cit> . finally, hgb haplotypes do not contain ins <dig> or ins <dig> insertions. the
phenotype of individuals containing haplotype  <dig>  is similar to
some extent to that of cultivars carrying haplotype  <dig> . consistently with this
phenotype, hgb haplotypes are mostly present in cultivars for wine use. because no
homozygous individuals were observed for haplotype  <dig> in the core collection, the
phenotypic effect of this haplotype is supposed to be much stronger in homozygous state,
which suggests that haplotype  <dig>  related to extreme phenology and cluster
characteristics, could be less favored in cultivars in homozygous state than haplotype
 <dig>  interestingly, partial sequencing of vvtfl1a in 20 v.v ssp.
sylvestris plants from the iberian peninsula identified wild haplotypes
similar to haplotype  <dig> and belonging to hgc . these data could indicate
a western origin for haplotypes of hgc.

CONCLUSIONS
three major vvtfl1a haplogroups were identified in cultivated grapevines based
on the presence of three main polymorphism ld blocks. these haplogroups are associated
to characteristic phenotypic values for flowering time, cluster width and berry size.
phenotypic differences between vvtfl1a haplogroups are consistent with the
classification of grapevine phenotypic diversity in three different morphotypes proposed
by negrul  <cit>  and could result from the use of different genetic pools in grapevine
domestication and/or the existence of different selection pressures on the development
of table and wine cultivars. polymorphic markers identifying haplogroups can also be
relevant in marker-assisted breeding programs addressing the improvement of cluster
structure and berry size.
