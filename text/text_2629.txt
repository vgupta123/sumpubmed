BACKGROUND
reactive oxygen species   are thought of as cytotoxic and mutagenic; however, recent data point to important biological roles for ros  <cit> . phagocytes generate large amounts of o2- as part of their microbicidal activity, which results from activation of a membrane-associated nadph oxidase. the key redox component of the oxidase is flavocytochrome b <dig>  which is comprised of an o2--generating catalytic subunit, gp91phox , and a non-catalytic subunit, p22phox  <cit> . recent studies indicate that similar nadph oxidase systems are present in a wide variety of non-phagocytic cells. while the nature of these non-phagocyte nadph oxidases is still being defined, it is clear that they are functionally and structurally distinct from the phagocyte oxidases.

nox <dig> has four conserved histidines that ligate two hemes between the 3rd and 5th of  <dig> transmembrane  α-helices and subregions that fold to provide binding cavities for fad and nadph  <cit>  . these canonical regions occupy about 35% of the nox <dig> sequence; however, little is known about essential roles for the other regions. recently, mammalian homologues of nox <dig> were identified and now constitute the nox/duox family  <cit> . in humans, there are five noxes  plus duox <dig> and duox <dig> . the activation of nox <dig> has been extensively studied and requires the association of essential cofactors. nox <dig> alone is inactive and must associate with p22phox to form a non-covalent heterodimer known as flavocytochrome b <dig>  additional regulatory subunits consist of p67phox, p47phox, p40phox and the small gtpase rac  <cit> . upon cell activation, these subunits translocate from the cytosol, assembling with and activating flavocytochrome b <dig> at the cell or phagosomal membrane. respective homologues of p47phox and p67phox, "nox organizer 1"  and "nox activator 1" , regulate nox <dig>  <cit> , and noxo <dig> also activates nox <dig>  <cit> . in comparison, nox <dig> requires p22phox but no other subunits  <cit> . all members of the human nox/duox family contain a flavocytochrome moiety, which we refer to as the "nox domain". nox <dig> consists of a nox domain plus an n-terminal ef-hand-containing calcium-binding domain  <cit> . duox1/ <dig> build on the nox <dig> structure by adding an n-terminal peroxidase domain  <cit> . nox/duox family members are reported in mouse, rat, cow, guinea pig, takifugu rubripes , caenorhabditis elegans , ciona intestinalis , sea urchin, fungi, cellular slime mold amoeba dictyostelium discoideum , red alga chondus crispus  and porphyra yezoensis , and green plants, including arabidopsis thaliana   <cit> . plant noxes are similar in domain structure to nox <dig>  <cit> . the ef-hands of human nox <dig>  human duox <dig>  and an a. thaliana nox are essential for calcium-stimulated activity  <cit> . red alga c. crispus and p. yezoensis possess an unusual nox enzyme  <cit> . the algal nox lacks an n-terminal ef-hand region and no regulatory subunit homologs are present; however, the algal nox has  <dig> additional predicted transmembrane α-helices that are situated between the 1st and 2nd nadph-binding sub-regions  <cit> .

genetic approaches have implicated nox/duox-derived ros in biological roles and pathological conditions, including hypertension , innate immunity , suppression of pathogen-induced cell death , stomatal closure , otoconia formation in the inner ear , biosynthesis of extracellular matrix , and thyroid hormone biosynthesis   <cit> . although widely expressed, little is known about evolutionary relationships among nox proteins.

herein, we analyzed nox/duox protein sequences from  <dig> vertebrates, one urochordate, one echinodermate, three insects, one nematode, four fungi, two red algae, one amoeba, and one green plant. using this large data set, we report  a novel molecular taxonomy and phylogeny of nox/duox proteins,  synteny of vertebrate nox/duox genes by genome annotation,  evolutionary substitution rates of vertebrate nox proteins and regulatory subunits, and  identification of key amino acid residues and regions conserved among all nox proteins.

RESULTS
molecular taxonomy of nox domains
we assembled deduced amino acid sequences from  <dig> nox/duox genes . each nox candidate was preliminarily aligned with human noxes to check whether the sequences conserved canonical regions required for o2- generation, such as the four heme-ligating histidines corresponding to his- <dig>  his- <dig>  his- <dig>  his- <dig> of human nox <dig> . nox genes are present in most eukaryotes including vertebrates, urochordates, echinodermates, nematodes, insects, fungi, plants amoeba, and red alga, but not in prokaryotes. schematic domain structures of nox/duox family proteins of human, the green plant a. thaliana, fungus magnaporthe grisea , the cellular slime mold amoeba , and the red alga  are shown in figure 1b. all members of nox/duox family expressed a nox domain containing the six transmembrane segments and flavocytochrome moiety . in addition, nox <dig>  duoxes, at-rboh-d, fungal noxc, and amoeba noxc all contained an ef hand-containing calcium-binding domain . duoxes also contained a peroxidase homology domain; whereas, amoeba noxes b and c also contained an asparagine-rich region . the malaria mosquito anopheles gambiae  genome encoded one unique nox gene, nox-mosquito , which encodes only the nox domain and no calcium-binding domain .

a molecular taxonomy, constructed by aligning the deduced amino acid sequences of the nox domains  revealed seven subfamilies . the subgroup consisting of nox1- <dig> includes noxes that are regulated by regulatory subunits, including nox <dig>  the classical phagocyte oxidase catalytic subunit . nox <dig> of the urochordate c. intestinalis  branched from a root common to vertebrate nox1- <dig> and conserves features common to all nox1- <dig> proteins. sea urchin s. purpuratus belongs to echinodermata, which diverged early from an ancestor common to urochordates and vertebrates  <cit> , and the s. purpuratus genome had two nox2-like proteins, nox2a and nox2b , which branched from a root common to all chordate noxes 1– <dig>  the taxonomy indicates that the s. purpuratus nox <dig> isologs represent a branch closest to the primordial ancestor of all isologs of vertebrate nox <dig>  nox <dig> and nox <dig>  the nox <dig> subfamily includes a urochordate isolog and branched from a root close to the nox1- <dig> subfamily. both the nox <dig> and the nox1- <dig> subfamilies originated from a common branch, and together form the two subgroups that are known to require a p22phox subunit for activity and/or stability  <cit> . neither of these subgroups occurs in green plants, fungi, or nematodes. for example, the s. purpuratus genome did not contain a distinct nox <dig> ortholog. although the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster  and honeybee apis mellifera  did not possess an ortholog of nox1- <dig> or nox <dig>  the malaria mosquito a. gambiae possessed one unique nox gene, noxm . we also searched for the gene in another mosquito genome aedes aegypti , the principal vector of yellow and dengue fevers, using the ncbi blast server  <cit> . the a. aegypti genome contained one noxm ortholog  similar to a. gambiae noxm, and also had nox <dig> and duox orthologs . the a. gambiae noxm protein branched from a root common to all chordate nox  <dig> ; however, the bootstrap value of the branch was only 60%, making it unclear whether noxm belongs to the p22phox-regulated subgroups  or to the noxa/noxb subgroup. the a. gambiae genome did not encode a distinct p22phox ortholog, suggesting that the noxa/noxb subgroup  may be a more appropriate assignment for this noxm.

the nox <dig> subgroup was composed of the orthologs  present in vertebrates , echinoderm, and insects; however, nox <dig> was not found in the urochordate c. intestinalis, or the nematode c. elegans. a nox <dig> ortholog of a green-spotted pufferfish tetraodon nigroviridis  was classified in the nox <dig> subgroup, as shown in figure  <dig> , but the predicted protein does not contain the n-terminal extension with the calcium-binding domain that is present in other nox <dig> orthologs . however, the nucleotide sequence around the presumed start codon  also did not match to a consensus kozak sequence   <cit> , suggesting that the reported sequence is likely to be incomplete. a nox <dig> ortholog  of zebrafish danio rerio  also did not contain the presumed start codon and the calcium-binding domain , suggesting that the sequence of this nox <dig> ortholog is also incomplete. the genome of sea urchin s. purpuratus encodes two nox <dig> isologs, nox5a and nox5b . the duox subgroup showed broad expression in bilateria, such as vertebrates, urochordates, echinoderms, nematodes and insects, but was not found in amoeba, fungi, or plants. plant nox homologs, previously termed "respiratory burst oxidase homologues "  <cit> , formed a distinct subgroup , and a. thaliana had  <dig> rboh homologues, suggesting specialized functions or tissue expression.

noxes representing the noxa/noxb subgroup and the noxc subgroup were present in fungi, and all fungi examined contained both noxa and noxb, except for aspergillus nidulans , which possessed only a noxa gene. yeast  did not possess any noxes. the domain structure of the noxa ortholog is similar to that of nox1-nox4; whereas, noxb proteins also have a short n-terminal extension that does not contain any recognizable domains or motifs . fungal noxc, present in m. grisea and fusarium graminearum , has an n-terminal ef-hand domain . the slime mold amoeba d. discoideum, a protozoan that straddles the boundary between animals and plants  <cit> , contained three nox isologs, noxa, noxb, and noxc . amoeba noxc has an ef-hand domain as well as an n-terminal extension containing an asparagine-rich region ; however, noxa and noxb both lack the ef-hand domain . the ef-hand-containing subfamilies  were the most abundant of the noxes, comprising well over half of the taxonomic tree . unlike other members of the noxc/noxd family, algal noxes  do not contain an ef-hand domain , but branched from a root shared by amoeba and fungal noxc . therefore, we refer to these algal nox proteins that lack an ef hand domain as noxd, which together with noxc form a distinct subgroup. because they share structural features common to ef hand-containing noxes, we speculate that that these noxes may be regulated by an as-yet unknown calcium-binding protein.

synteny of nox/duox genes in vertebrates
a summary of the occurrence and number of nox/duox genes in vertebrates , urochordate, echinodermate, nematode, insects, fungi, green plants amoeba, and red alga is shown in figure 3a. although we performed extensive blast searches  <cit> , some noxes did not appear to be present in all vertebrate genomes. for example, a rat or mouse ortholog of nox <dig> and a frog xenopus tropicalis  or teleost fish ortholog of nox <dig> was not found . teleost fish listed in figure 3a had one complete duox ortholog, but no paralog corresponding to mammalian duox <dig>  to substantiate that these genes were indeed absent, we compared chromosomal synteny  of nox/duox orthologs in vertebrates. syntenies of c. intestinalis noxes were so divergent from those of vertebrates that it was not possible to perform syntenic analyses for this species. syntenies of nox <dig>  nox <dig> and nox <dig>  were the most highly preserved among nox/duox genes.

the human nox <dig> gene is positioned following tiam <dig>  tfbim and cldn <dig> on chromosome  <dig> , a synteny that was conserved in mammals and chickens gallus gallus . puffer fish, fugu t. rubripes and tetraodon t. nigroviridis lacked a nox <dig> ortholog, and tiam <dig>  tfbim and cldn <dig> were followed instead by filip <dig>  tmem30a and col12a <dig>  in the genome of x. tropicalis, there was greater variation in synteny: tfbim was present, but neither nox <dig> nor other linked markers were seen. a nox <dig> gene was not found in the genome of zebrafish d. rerio, but nucleotide fragments encoding these marker genes of d. rerio were too short to demonstrate the absence of nox <dig> by syntenic analysis. thus, nox <dig> emerged during evolution sometime after the emergence of fish and amphibians from a common ancestor of birds and mammals.

the synteny of genetic markers surrounding nox <dig> was highly conserved in human, dog canis familliaris , mouse, rat, chicken, cow bos taurus , opossum monodelphis domestica,  and frog . we also found nox <dig> gene fragments in rabbit oryctolagus cuniculus  and armadillo dasypus novemcinctus  draft-sequenced genomes . however, rodents  lacked nox <dig>  clearly demonstrating that this gene had been lost. interestingly, pufferfish t. rubripes and t. nigroviridis had nox5-like genes, but the gene markers were present on a different scaffold fragment . mammals and frog x. tropicalis each had two paralogs of duox , while chicken had only one. fish genomes possessed a single duox gene that followed a single nip gene . like duox, the nip gene has also undergone gene duplication to form nip <dig> and nip <dig>  interestingly, nip <dig> and nip <dig> in figure 3g are identical to duoxa <dig> and duoxa <dig>  respectively, proteins that were recently described to participate in the activation and maturation of duoxes  <cit> . due to the complexity of the tetraploid genomes of zebrafish and incomplete genomic sequence, however, we cannot rule out a second duox in another chromosomal location.

structural variations among nox domains
the molecular taxonomy of noxes in figure  <dig> suggested that unique structural features characterize each nox subfamily. noxes possess five loops  that join tm regions , and also segments connecting canonical subdomains, such as fad-binding regions  and predicted nadph-binding regions   <cit> . alignment of nox domains demonstrates that each nox subgroup has characteristic sizes of these loops and segments . for example, nox1- <dig> have a longer c-loop, nox <dig> has a longer e-loop, and plant noxes have an extended d-loop . nox <dig> proteins have shortened a- and e-loops and a long and variable insertion between fad- and nadph-binding domains; whereas, the fungal noxc and algal noxd have an extended c-terminus and long insertions between nadph-binding subregions. thus, each nox/duox ortholog has characteristic structural features conserved throughout evolution. the differences in loop size indicate that the basic catalytic function of the nox domain is able to tolerate considerable structural variation in this region. certain loops, especially "loop b" and "tm6-fad"  were conserved in size among all noxes, perhaps pointing to their structural or functional importance.

substitution rates of nox domains and nox regulatory subunits
to compare the rates of evolution among nox subfamilies, we calculated substitution rates among the vertebrate orthologs. for nox <dig> and duox1/ <dig>  the rates, expressed as amino acid substitutions per site per  <dig> years, were notably lower , compared with other noxes . the regulator subunits p47phox, noxo <dig>  p67phox, noxa <dig>  and p22phox that are seen in human are also observed in other vertebrates . evolutionary substitution rates of the nox regulatory subunits are shown in figure 5b. like nox <dig>  the substitution rates of p22phox and the nox <dig> regulators, p47phox and p67phox, are significantly lower than those of the nox <dig> regulatory subunits, noxo <dig> and noxa <dig> .

identification of critical amino acids common to all nox/duox proteins
key structural features of noxes have been retained over hundreds of millions of years, implying key conserved residues from a common ancestor. conserved amino acids were identified by aligning the  <dig> sequences of the nox domain shown in sd <dig>  but omitting hydrophobic amino acids in transmembrane regions. sixty-eight residues were highly conserved in all nox proteins . his- <dig>  his- <dig>  his- <dig>  and his- <dig>  were present in all noxes except for two duox isologs , consistent with their proposed roles  <cit>  as axial and distal ligands for the two heme irons. sequences of the two divergent duox isologs encode leucines at the residues corresponding to his- <dig> of h-nox <dig> , suggesting that these duox proteins are probably not able to produce ros, or that they might have an unknown function conferred by the other canonical structures, such as fad and nadph binding sites. these findings also imply that a single duox protein is sufficient to fulfill the biological role of the enzyme in these species. specific amino acids were conserved in the two canonical fad-binding subregions  and in or near the four nadph-binding subregions . four additional conserved regions were noted: b-loop, tm6-fad, vxgpfg-motif, and the extreme c-terminus . we compared these positions to point mutations previously identified in nox <dig> from variants of x-linked chronic granulomatous disease . cgd is a genetic immune disorder characterized by a functionally defective phagocyte nadph oxidase, and the x-linked form is caused by mutations in the nox <dig> gene. of  <dig> known cgd point mutations  <cit> ,  <dig> are in amino acids conserved among all noxes . these naturally occurring mutations in cgd confirm the importance of these residues to nox function and stability. among the cgd point mutants that are conserved among all noxes, his-209-arg, gly-389-glu, leu-420-pro and trp-516-arg are nox <dig> protein-null cgd mutants , and result in the absence of nox <dig> protein in the patient's neutrophils. the loss of nox <dig> is thought to be due to destabilization of the protein structure and rapid protein degradation. his-101-tyr and his-338-tyr cause decreased nox2-expression in cgd , suggesting that in addition to being functionally important in enzymatic activity or activation of noxes, many of the  <dig> amino acids conserved among all noxes are likely to be involved in maintaining or stabilizing the structure of the nox domain. there were several exceptions among these otherwise highly conserved residues , and these are listed in additional file  <dig>  these rare exceptions could be due to mis-sequencing of the genome or to tolerance of evolutionary changes in the species. to test functional importance of the b-loop, vxgpfg-motif, tm6-fad region, and c-terminus, we generated  <dig> point mutations of human nox <dig>  individual mutation of these conserved amino acids markedly inhibited and in some cases, completely abolished ros production in a cell model system in which nox <dig> and its regulatory subunits were also expressed . therefore, along with the canonical domains for cofactor binding, sequence comparisons identified additional regions that are important for nox2-dependent ros generation. nox <dig> is expressed as a protein of  <dig> kda , which is then glycosylated to generate a form with an apparent molecular size of  <dig> kda . none of the mutants of nox <dig>  except for gly- <dig>  affected the expression of nox <dig> protein ; however, nox <dig> mutated at arg- <dig>  or gly- <dig>  failed to form a complex with p22phox, as determined by co-immunoprecipitation, and these mutations also failed to become glycosylated . protein of the nox <dig> mutations in gly- <dig> was not detected by western blotting, which is likely due to de-stabilization of the protein or possibly to impaired recognition by the monoclonal antibody because the epitope of antibody overlaps gly- <dig>  <cit> .

variations in calcium-binding domain structures
the majority of noxes in figure  <dig> fall into calcium-regulated subgroups. several calcium-binding motifs have evolved, including the ef-hand motif, which is ubiquitous in eukaryote and prokaryote genomes. the ef-hand motif was first described in the crystal structure of parvalbumin  <cit> . this motif has a characteristic helix-loop-helix  structure, consisting of approximately  <dig> residues, with the  <dig> residues situated in the loop contributing to the calcium binding  <cit> . by comparing the nox/duox sequences with the prosite database  <cit> ,  <dig> nox/duox sequences contained single or multiple ef-hands . they include animal nox <dig> and duox, plant nox at-rboh, and noxc of amoeba and fungi . nox <dig> had four ef-hand motifs . the n-terminal motif was non-canonical  <cit>  ; however, this motif is also crucial for ros-generating activity of nox <dig>  as a truncated mutation of the non-canonical ef-hand motif in human nox <dig> lacked calcium-dependent ros generation in nox5-transfected hek <dig> cells . although there are rare exceptions to the consensus sequences in the c-terminal ef-hand motif sequences of duox , duox has two canonical ef-hands corresponding to the 2nd and 3rd ef-hands of nox <dig> . to add confidence to the alignment between ef-hand motif regions of nox <dig> and duox, a structural homology model of regions containing ef-hands of human nox <dig> and human duox <dig> was developed using the comparative protein modeling method . although the region between the 2nd ef-hand and tm ii domains of duox lacks a classical ef-hand motif, this region of human duox <dig> is predicted to form a hlh structure , similar to the predicted hlh structure comprising the 4th ef-hand motif of human nox <dig> . according to alignment of duox sequences shown in additional file  <dig>  this additional "hlh" region of duox seems to be widely conserved among animal duox proteins, with the exception of chicken g. gallus and fugu t. rubripes orthologs. thus, duox and nox <dig> possess structural homology in these regions, even though the total number of canonical ef-hand motifs is different. as shown in figure 8b, the alignment also indicates that a. thaliana at-rboh and amoeba d. discoideum noxc each possess two ef-hands that corresponded to the 3rd and 4th motifs of nox5; whereas, the 2nd ef-hand regions of all at-rboh proteins did not correspond to the ef-hand consensus sequence . like at-rboh proteins, one of ef-hand motifs of amoeba noxc did not follow the consensus sequence . nevertheless, these inconsistencies in the consensus sequence of ef-hands do not eliminate the possibility that such ef-hand-like motifs could bind to calcium ion, as a number of exceptions to this rule have been found  <cit> . a single canonical ef-hand is detected in two fungal noxc , which corresponds to the position of the 3rd motif of nox <dig> . thus, binding of calcium to a single ef-hand may be sufficient in some noxes to impart calcium regulatability. in contrast, calcium binding to nox <dig> is likely to be cooperative, and might be expected to permit regulation over a narrower range of calcium concentrations.

phylogeny of noxes
the relationship between the phylogenic tree of organisms and the occurrence of nox/duox family genes  was determined by synteny and sequence information. calcium-regulated, ef-hand-containing noxes are not only abundant , but also appeared very early during the evolution of eukaryotes. nox <dig> appeared late in evolution, corresponding to the permanent transition of vertebrates from water to land. a primordial nox <dig> appeared first in echinoderms, while nox <dig> first appeared somewhat later in urochordates. nox <dig> emerged relatively later in teleost fish. the mosquitoes a. gambiae and a. aegypti  have noxm gene  that is difficult to classify, but may belong in the noxa/noxb family, as discussed above . red macro-algae are eukaryotes and are thought to have branched earlier than plants from a common root  <cit> . the red algae c. crispus and p. yezoensis possess noxd, which lacks an n-terminal ef-hand region . although these species do not appear to possess any regulatory subunit homologs  <cit> , noxd contains an additional  <dig> predicted transmembrane regions. the function of such additional transmembrane regions is unknown, and it is not yet clear whether this atypical nox represents an ancestral prototype or a later adaptation.

discussion
this report provides the first extensive analysis of nox sequences and synteny throughout evolution and provides a conceptual framework for future structure/enzymatic function studies and for understanding the diversity of biological functions of these enzymes. molecular taxonomy  revealed seven nox/duox subfamilies rather than the three that were previously identified based on the presence or absence of calcium-binding and peroxidase domains  <cit> . significantly, noxes are not present in prokaryotes. one can speculate that while defense enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, evolved very early to protect aerobic organisms to protect against accidentally-generated ros, later organisms subsequently developed the capacity to generate ros in a regulated, "deliberate" manner, with specific regulatory subunits co-evolving with specific noxes. the earliest nox <dig> ortholog seems to have appeared in the sea urchin s. purpuratus. a number of investigators have suggested that sea urchin has phagocytic cells that express an ortholog of the complement component c <dig> and can phagocytose against invading microbes  <cit> . although it is unclear whether these cells produce ros to kill microbes, the taxonomy shown in figure  <dig> implies that the sea urchin expresses a nox <dig> ortholog that might play a role in the innate immune response.

the synteny of each nox/duox member raises new questions about nox/duox evolution. for example, nox <dig> in mouse inner ear is essential for formation of otoconia, mineralized structures that participate in the vestibular system in perception of gravity  <cit> . fish and amphibians also have otoconia  but do not express nox <dig> . this may implicate another nox, for example nox <dig> ortholog, in otoconia formation prior to nox <dig> appearance in land vertebrates, or it may point to a unique function of nox <dig> in land vertebrates. kiss et al. have suggested that lactoperoxidase  functions in peroxidation of the lipid envelope of globular substance in the inner ear together with nox <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, molecular taxonomy of animal heme peroxidases demonstrates that lpo orthologs emerged in birds and mammals, but not in fish . it implies that noxes and their physiological partners evolved simultaneously, resulting in gaining a new function. mosquito has a unique nox gene, noxm. although a physiological function of noxm is completely unknown, a unique appearance of noxm gene in the species imply a possible relationship between noxm and sucking of blood or a playing role as a principal vector of the pathogen. while the function of nox <dig> is not yet understood, its loss in rodents suggests that another nox may compensate in these species, implying a certain degree of plasticity of nox isoform function. alternatively, nox <dig> may not perform an essential function, at least in short-lived species.

it is of interest to compare residue substitution rates among nox isologs, since all members possess fundamentally similar structures in their flavocytochrome domains, including a high degree of conservation of binding sites for prosthetic groups. substitution rates vary among different proteins, such as egf , ngf , lactate dehydrogenase , cytochrome c , and histone h <dig>   <cit> . the substitution rates of nox/duox subfamilies ranged from  <dig>  ~  <dig>  ; whereas, those of p22phox, organizer proteins , and activator proteins  were  <dig>  ~  <dig> . the substitution rates of nox <dig> and its regulatory subunits, p47phox and p67phox, were relatively low, implying evolutionary changes in these proteins are more poorly tolerated. such a result may be explained by the importance of the biological function of nox <dig> in host defense and by the stringent regulation of this enzyme system to prevent inappropriate activation leading tissue damage  <cit> . in addition, the nox <dig> system requires multiple protein interactions among catalytic and regulatory subunits with upstream regulatory subunits and lipids, and these undoubtedly impose strict limitations on the number of tolerated mutations. although incompletely understood, substitution data point to the critical nature of duox functions, since changes in the duox sequence are also poorly tolerated over evolutionary time . duoxes are implicated in thyroid hormone biosynthesis  <cit>  and innate immunity in lung  <cit> , and are distributed in a variety of other tissues where they perform unknown functions. duox is also implicated in fertilization in sea urchin, where h2o2-supported cross-linking of fertilization envelope proteins prevents polyspermy  <cit> .

in contrast to other eukaryotes, yeast  did not possess noxes. yeast ferric reductase  has a domain structure similar to noxes but participates in iron uptake rather than oxygen reduction  <cit> . alignment between human nox <dig> and fre proteins demonstrates that the sequence of fre proteins is very different from the noxes except for the vxgpfg-motif and nadph-binding site residues . this suggests that this distant homolog has evolved in yeast to carry out an entirely different function, and it is debatable whether it should even be classified with the nox family.

in addition to binding residues for prosthetic groups, the present study has identified four additional regions  as critical for function in all noxes. the specific functions of these regions are not yet fully understood; however, mutational analysis demonstrates their importance . the b-loop  and tm6-fad  regions of nox <dig> appear to participate directly or indirectly in binding to p22phox , since their mutation prevented co-immunoprecipitation of nox <dig> and p22phox. in addition, these mutations prevented glycosylation of nox <dig> to form the mature  <dig> kda form of the protein, supporting the concept that association with p22phox is a necessary pre-requisite for glycosylation  <cit> . nevertheless, these two amino acid residues are also conserved in noxes that do not require p22phox . thus, these residues might mediate another important interaction in nox <dig> that is analogous to that with p22phox, and ongoing studies are investigating the roles of these residues in nox <dig> function. the presence of non-canonical, but highly conserved residues and regions that are shown in figure 7a suggests that noxes might have an unknown common feature relevant to the mechanism of activation or a common biological function. moreover, these conserved regions may also provide a key to identifying a novel common molecule that interacts and co-operates with all nox/duox proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we report herein an exhaustive analysis of nox/duox protein family. the present studies provide a new molecular classification system in which nox and duox proteins are organized into seven distinct subfamilies. these studies also identify nox <dig> as the most recently emerged nox. calcium-regulated, ef-hand-containing noxes appeared very early during the evolution of eukaryotes. two mosquitoes possess a unique nox gene, noxm, but not fruit fly or ant. consistent with the physiological importance of nox <dig> in innate immunity and duox for hormone synthesis and host defense, these two nox proteins are more stringently conserved of all noxes. by comparison of amino acid sequences,  <dig> residues were identified as highly conserved among all nox/duox orthologs, and the b-loop, tm6-fad, vxgpfg-motif, and extreme c-terminal regions were identified as important for nox activity. thus, this report provides a conceptual basis for understanding the evolutionary history of noxes and duoxes and provides key structural information relevant to the activation mechanisms of modern nox/duox proteins.
