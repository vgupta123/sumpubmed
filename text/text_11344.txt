BACKGROUND
lily and tulip  are monocot perennial herbs that have unsurpassed beauty and great commercial significance. they are also very interesting from an evolutionary point of view since both species have very huge genomes . the two species are comparable in several aspects: both are bulbous monocots, have 2n = 2x =  <dig> chromosomes, and a long growth cycle . for both species genetic resources are limited.

the genus lilium, includes around  <dig> species which are taxonomically classified into seven sections: martagon, pseudolirium, lilium, archelirion, sinomartagon, leucolirion, and oxypetala <cit> . different species within each section are relatively easy to cross and hybrids are fertile
 <cit> . hybrids within sections leucolirion, archelirion, and sinomartagon represent the most important groups for breeding and are referred to as: longiflorum , trumpet , asiatic , and oriental  hybrids. an extensive number of cytogenetic studies explored karyotypes of lily e.g.
 <cit> . meiosis of interspecific hybrids and cytological maps of three complete genomes of lilies  based on recombination sites in bc progenies of two interspecific hybrids
 <cit>  were studied. on the other hand, genetic mapping of lily has not yet been well studied. the currently available genetic maps which were constructed using dominant markers  are not well saturated
 <cit> . the available est data
 <cit>  in the sequence database is very limited with only  <dig>  ests deposited
 <cit> .

the genus tulipa l. comprises about  <dig> species
 <cit>  that are taxonomically classified into two subgenera: tulipa and eriostemones <cit> . subgenus tulipa is subdivided into five sections named: tulipa, eichleres, tulipanun, kolpakowskianae, and clusianae. the commercial cut flower assortment of tulips consists mainly of cultivars from tulipa gesneriana  and t. fosteriana 
 <cit> . so far, there are no genetic maps or molecular markers published for tulip, and additionally no ests are found in the databases for this species.

lilium and tulipa are expected to be highly heterozygous species since both are outcrossing species and derived from a number of interspecific crosses. however there is no data available on the actual levels of heterozygosity within each species.

breeding in these two species is limited by their long juvenile phase whereas the success of new cultivars is increasingly influenced by the presence of disease resistances against fusarium, botrytis, and tulip breaking virus
 <cit> . these resistances are difficult to breed for using classical breeding because of the quantitative nature of the resistances and/or elaborate disease tests. for instance, fusarium resistance in lily is known to be controlled by six putative qtls  and disease tests are highly influenced by environment
 <cit> . developing user friendly, efficient, transferable, and co-dominant markers such as snps and ssrs markers that can be implemented in molecular assisted breeding  applications will help to speed up breeding in these two species.

recent studies have shown that next generation sequencing technology can be an effective tool to generate huge amounts of sequence data in a short time which can be implemented in all types of genetic and genomic studies such as: transcriptome characterization, molecular marker development
 <cit> , ecological genetics
 <cit> , and evolutionary studies
 <cit> . with the purpose of generating the first broad survey of genes in lily and tulip, we sequenced and assembled transcriptomes of four lily and five tulip genotypes using  <dig> pyro-sequencing. the sequence assemblies were used to identify a set of snps suited for high throughput genotyping purposes, and to screen for est-ssrs. orthologous genes between lily and tulip were identified and compared with the model species ‘rice’. the whole set of generated contigs for lily and tulip were annotated and described according to go  terminology. common markers that can be genotyped and mapped in both species were identified based on orthologous genes.

RESULTS
est sequencing and assembly
we performed  <dig> gs flx titanium pyro-sequencing on nine normalized cdna libraries constructed from leaves of four lily genotypes , and five tulip genotypes . the number of sequenced reads obtained varied between  <dig>  reads for ‘connecticut king’ and  <dig>  reads for ‘kees nelis’ . the percentage of sequence reads that was retained for assembly after quality filtration ranged between 67% and 75%  which was somewhat higher than those for 454/sanger data of eucalyptus 
 <cit> , and close to the 79% for pinus contorta <cit> . average read length ranged between 278 bp for ‘bellona’ and 389 bp for ‘cantata’ . these results were comparable  with that obtained in other studies like blanca et al.
 <cit>  where the processed reads of cucurbit retained after trimming was 64% with an average read length of 321 bp. after filtration, remaining reads were used for de novo assembly using clc.

currently, a total of  <dig>  lily’s ests are available in the nucleotide sequence databases generated from lilium formosanum 
 <cit> , l. longiflorum , oriental hybrids , and l. regale . these ests could be clustered into just  <dig> contigs
 <cit> . in this study, we generated  <dig>  consensus sequences  representing gene fragments from the four main groups of lilium. also,  <dig>  contigs for tulip, representing the two main groups of commercial tulips: t. fosteriana and t. gesneriana, were generated which present the first est data for tulip. overall, the number of lily contigs generated in this study is comparable to that obtained in other transcriptome analyses such as for cucurbit 
 <cit> , and for eucalyptus 
 <cit> . the number of tulip contigs is at the high end. it is, however, important to keep in mind that number of generated contigs does not reflect number of genes. fragments of one gene could be assembled in different contigs due to: short contigs length  compared with the average gene length , missing overlap among contigs which might be related to the not fully unbiased cdna synthesis step in sequence library construction using random hexamer primers, or orthologous sequences among genotypes are assembled into different contigs due to high genetic divergence among different genotypes.

running assembly for the four lily genotypes together  or for the five tulip genotypes together  resulted in a dramatic increase in singleton and contig numbers . these effects can be explained because different sets of genes were being sequenced among the different genotypes, and/or that orthologous sequences among genotypes tend to split up into different contigs due to the high level of heterogeneity among the genotypes
 <cit> . for lily, the four genotypes were a result of interspecific crosses between different species within their respective sections. in tulip, there is a slightly similar situation for the difference between t. gesneriana and t. fosteriana. the fact that the assembly of reads from the tulip genotypes within their respective t. gesneriana and t. fosteriana sections shows a much better performance confirms the influence of heterogeneity in the assembly.

clc assembler with default setting was used to assemble lily and tulip data since it showed to be capable to handle sequence data of heterozygous nature more efficiently compared with other assemblers like: cap <dig>  mira, velvet, and soap regarding number of contigs, number of singletons, and redundancy
 <cit> . the parameters of clc were not tested further as using less stringent parameters might lead to an increase of chimeric contigs due to the assembly of paralogs in one contig
 <cit> . absence of a complete genome sequence for lily and tulip, or for a close relative, makes it difficult to check the most optimal assembly settings with respect to the quality of assembly. consequently, lily-all and tulip-all assemblies were not used for markers development to avoid possible mistakes related to the assembly of these relatively distant genotypes. instead orthologous groups determined by orthomcl were used for marker development between different genotypes .

an estimation of transcriptome coverage of lily and tulip genotypes was made . there is no information about the total size or number of genes in lily and tulip. therefore, transcriptome size was assumed to be similar to that of rice, which is also a monocot species. the gene space of rice was estimated to be around 82 mb . gene coverage for each lily and tulip genotype was calculated based on total number of bases generated  as a percentage of the assumed gene space . in lily, gene coverage varied between 26% in ‘connecticut king’ and 46% in ‘trumpet’, with average gene coverage of 37%. in tulip, gene coverage was on average 39%, varying from 23% in ‘bellona’ to 63% in ‘kees nelis’. the combined t. gesneriana cdna sequences seem to cover the entire gene space although two-thirds was derived of singletons . the large number of contigs generated and good coverage of the transcriptome for both species shows the high efficiency of next generation sequencing technology, especially taking into account that a single  <dig> run of normalized cdna libraries, constructed out of one tissue and from a single growing stage was used. however to further improve transcriptome coverage, sequencing different tissues and developmental stages is needed.

the estimated percentage of transcriptome coverage for each genotype was calculated based on the number of genes and average gene size in rice.

snp marker detection
contigs that contain at least one snp  were identified using qualitysnp
 <cit>  software and their percentage of the total contig number was calculated . this percentage exceeded 40% for lily genotypes except for ‘connecticut king’ . similarly in tulip, this percentage also exceeded 40% in t. fosteriana, while it was lower in t. gesneriana genotypes . these results were comparable to those detected in other outcrossing species like eucalyptus 
 <cit> .

* percentages of contigs that contain at least one snp calculated according to the total number of contigs.

** percentage of snp markers from total nr. of contigs that contain at least one snp.

number of contigs that contain at least one snp was calculated. snp markers with 50 bps flanking sequences free of secondary snp, and with one secondary snp allowance in the flanking sequences were identified.

qualitysnp
 <cit>  software was also used to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms that can be used as snp markers by comparing reads within each contig. we analyzed only snps and excluded all indels due to the fact that  <dig> has serious problems with mono-nucleotide tracts and may introduce indels without biological significance frequently.

two sets of snp markers were developed. the first set consisted of markers that have no other snps in the 50 bp flanking regions of the target snp. the percentages of these markers compared to total number of contigs that have at least one snp were calculated . the highest percentage in lily was for ‘connecticut king’ , while the other three cultivars showed lower percentages . in tulip, the percentage of snp markers for t. fosteriana cultivars  was two times higher than for t. gesneriana genotypes . the second set of snp markers also allowed markers that have one secondary snp in the 50 bp flanking regions, which caused a  <dig> to  <dig> times increase in the number of snp markers . the number of snp markers identified in each genotype then ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  snp markers in lily and between  <dig> and  <dig>  snp markers in tulip. compared with the  <dig> snp markers generated in eucalyptus when no control on the flanking snps was applied
 <cit>  this indicates that the heterozygosity of both bulbous crops is considerable.

mining for microsatellites
we screened lily and tulip contigs for the presence of ssrs, and analyzed their nature and frequency . percentages of est-ssr  found in lily genotypes were comparable with each other  except for ‘connecticut king’ that showed a lower percentage . in tulip, percentages of est-ssr in contigs were similar within t. fosteriana genotypes , and similar within t. gesneriana genotypes , although lower in t. gesneriana compared to t. fosteriana. having the same criteria for ssr retrieval, the percentages of ssrs found for lily and tulip were higher than results found for medicago truncatula 
 <cit> , comparable to grape and barley 
 <cit> , and lower than for pigeon pea 
 <cit> .

* percentage of ssr repeats calculated according to the total number of contigs.

** percentage of ssr repeats from total nr. of ssrs.

frequency and distribution of di-, tri-, tetra-, and hexa-nucleotide repeats were analyzed in each genotype . in both species, the most frequent repeat motif was ag/ct for di-nucleotide repeats and ccg/cgg for tri-nucleotide repeats. similar results were found in barley
 <cit>  which is also a monocot with a large genome size. more than 86% of the identified est-ssrs in lily and tulip are di- or tri- nucleotide repeats. in lily, tri-nucleotide repeats were just slightly more abundant than di-nucleotide repeats although almost equal amounts were found in ‘star gazer’ and ‘trumpet’ . in tulip, tri-nucleotide repeats were around two fold more abundant than di-nucleotide repeats . this finding in tulip is in agreement with previous findings in grape and castor bean
 <cit> .

previous studies have shown a dominance of tri-nucleotide repeats in coding regions as can be expected because length variance for tri-nucleotide motifs does not result in frame shifts in genes
 <cit> . accordingly di-nucleotide repeats were found to be dominant in the 5′- and 3′-utr regions
 <cit> . our analysis in lily and tulip showed a selection against di-nucleotide repeats in coding regions compared with utr regions . the percentage of di-nucleotide repeats in coding regions  was half of that in utr regions , while tri-nucleotide repeats were spread with equal frequency over coding and utr regions . these results, are in line with the result in wheat
 <cit> .

orthologous sequences
having cdna sequence data, allows the use of comparative genomics to reveal regions of sequence conservation
 <cit>  and hence improve our understanding of the species evolution. to define conserved genes between lily and tulip, and compare that with the most sequenced and annotated monocot species ‘rice’, orthologous groups that are shared among them were identified. protein sequences of the rice genome  were retrieved from phytozome  for comparison. contig sequences of the nine lily and tulip genotypes were translated using estscan2
 <cit>  and compared with rice proteins using orthomcl
 <cit> . a total of  <dig>  protein sequences of rice, lily, and tulip were clustered into  <dig>  orthologous groups. a total of  <dig>  orthologous groups for rice,  <dig>  orthologous groups for lily, and  <dig>  orthologous groups for tulip were generated . overall,  <dig>  groups contained sequences from all three species,  <dig> groups were specific for lily and rice,  <dig> groups were specific for tulip and rice, and  <dig>  groups were specific for lily and tulip . the  <dig>  groups that are shared among the three monocot species represent 31% of the total number of orthologous groups identified in this study. this percentage is far less than the 71% shared orthologous groups among three monocot grasses species: rice, sorghum, and brachypodium <cit> . however, the divergence among rice, sorghum, and brachypodium dated back  <dig> myr ago
 <cit> , while the divergence between rice and lilium or tulipa is much older. it has been reported that the divergence between rice and musa took places around  <dig> myr ago
 <cit>  and between rice and allium is more than  <dig> myr ago
 <cit> . consequently, the divergence between rice  and lilium and tulipa  is expected to be between 170– <dig> myr ago
 <cit>  which explains the lower number of shared orthologous groups identified between rice and liliaceae in our study.

the number of orthologous groups between lily and tulip  is less than the 67% shared orthologous groups between tomato and potato
 <cit> . this low percentage of shared orthologous groups between lily and tulip might be related to the older divergence time  between members of liliaceae family
 <cit> , compared with  <dig>  myr tomato-potato divergence
 <cit> . however, we do expect that the percentage of shared orthologous groups will increase by sequencing more tissues and different developmental stages of the different genotypes.

gene annotation and gene ontology
for gene annotation we used the assemblies lily-all and tulip-all to survey what types of genes are present in both flower bulb species. also the  <dig>  orthologous groups from the orthomcl analyses were annotated to identify the type of genes that are shared among the three monocot species .

a blast analysis using the non-redundant protein database  from ncbi with an e value threshold of 1e- <dig> was performed using blast2go software
 <cit> . at least one significant blast hit was found for 49% of lily-all contigs , 30% of tulip-all contigs , and 93% of the orthologous groups . as was expected, oryza sativa  showed to be the closest species to both lily and tulip because most first hits were with sequences from this species. having only 49% and 30% of lily-all and tulip-all contigs annotated, respectively, demonstrates the very rich source of not yet identified genes that need to be annotated. however, not all genes in the genebank are annotated, and it is also possible that genes from lily and tulip deviate significantly at the sequence level from the existing orthologous genes in databases at the threshold value of 1e- <dig>  or that the length of part of the contigs is not enough to find significant similarity.

gene ontology provides a structured and controlled terminology to describe gene products according to three categories: molecular function , biological process , and cell component 
 <cit> . since genes can be part of different pathways or have more than one function at the same time, the same gene can have more than one go description  and thus belong to more than one of the earlier mentioned categories. the annotated contigs of lily-all, tulip-all, and the orthologous sequences among lily, tulip, and rice were used for gene ontology assignments. gene ontology assignments of lily-all contigs were divided into: 42% , 31% , and 27% . in tulip-all contigs, gene ontology assignments were divided into: 19% , 42% , and 39%  contigs.

both species showed to have similar go terms in the three categories. the differences were in the amount of contigs annotated for each go term. in the category molecular function, the most represented go terms were of binding function such as ‘protein binding’, ‘atp binding’, ‘binding’, ‘nucleic acid binding’ in addition to all types of activities such as ‘protein kinase activity’, ‘transferase activity’, ‘transporter activity’, ‘catalytic activity’, and ‘oxidoreductase activity’ . the go terms that were identified in lily and tulip  were identified as well in medicago truncatula, cucurbita pepo, cucurbita melo, and oryza sativa <cit> . ion binding terminology such as ‘calcium binding’, ‘iron binding’, and ‘zinc binding’ were highly represented in lily , similar to olive leaf
 <cit> .

in the category biological process, there were clear differences between lily and tulip in the enrichment of go terms . lily’s contigs were more concentrated in activities like ‘auxin biosynthetic process’, ‘oxidation reduction’, ‘metabolic process’, ‘carbohydrate metabolic process’, ‘translation’, ‘protein amino acid binding’, and ‘transmembrane transport’ whereas response to biotic and biotic stresses such as responses to salt, heat, cold, nematode, bacteria, virus, and fungus stresses were more represented in tulip .

the go terms ‘flower development’, ‘embryonic development’, and ‘pollen development’ are present in our data although we sequenced young leaves. this is either related to the combination of flowering and vegetative growing stages ), or genes are involved in different pathways and not only in flower development. on the other hand, the high level of ‘auxin biosynthetic process’ recorded in lily might reflect the central on-going processes which are mainly plant-cell elongation, apical dominance , and rooting processes which are all known to be controlled by auxin.

the go terms of cellular compound category showed significant representation of ‘mitochondrion’, ‘plastid’, ‘plasma membrane’, ‘membrane’, ‘nucleus’, ‘cytosol’, ‘chloroplast’, and ‘integral to membrane’  which was similar to previous studies
 <cit> . all contigs of mitochondria, chloroplast, and plastid that were defined here , are very interesting for phylogenetic studies but may be less suitable for marker development aiming at mapping for breeding purposes.

go assessment of the  <dig>  orthologous groups among tulip, lily, and rice were divided into: 31% , 41% , and 28% . a summary description of annotated contigs for the orthologous genes in each go category is provided in figure 
 <dig>  genes essential for growing and defense processes are shown to be the main orthologous sequences between the three species. genes involved in response to biotic, abiotic, and endogenous stimulus were also defined . under molecular function category, mainly binding activity was identified . overall, the majority of orthologous genes were housekeeping genes. more detailed data has become available that can serve as a major resource for further research . it is interesting to study the go terms enrichment of orthologous groups specific for lily and tulip  because they may consist of genes specific for bulbous crops.

identification of common snp markers and ssrs within and between lily and tulip
exchanging genetic information between two related species by linking their genetic maps would be of great interest. this linking will facilitate comparative mapping of genes across distantly related plant species by direct comparison of dna sequences and map positions such as between wheat and barley, tomato and potato, and arabidopsis and brassica <cit> . identification of polymorphisms in orthologous sequences that allow marker development in both species will provide a set of common genetic loci that can be implemented for comparative mapping and thus improve our understanding of the evolutionary history  of the lily and tulip genome. for this, snp markers and est-ssr were developed from the parents of mapping populations in lily  and tulip . the orthologous groups identified by orthomcl were extracted for each of the four parents’ combinations. these orthologous groups were searched for snp markers and ssrs.

as a result, ‘connecticut king’ showed to have  <dig> and  <dig> snp markers in common with ‘kees nelis’ and ‘cantata’, respectively; ‘white fox’ has  <dig> and  <dig> common snp markers with ‘kees nelis’ and ‘cantata’, respectively . as for common ssrs, ‘connecticut king’ showed to have  <dig> and  <dig> common est-ssr with ‘kees nelis’ and ‘cantata’, respectively. similarly, ‘white fox’ has  <dig> and  <dig> common est-ssr with ‘kees nelis’ and ‘cantata’, respectively . thus,  <dig> common snp markers and  <dig> common est-ssr were identified between the lily and tulip populations. similarly, common snp markers between the parents of the lily population and between the parents of the tulip population were identified. ‘connecticut king’ and ‘white fox’ have  <dig> common snp markers and  <dig> common est-ssr; and ‘cantata’ and ‘kees nelis’ have  <dig> common snp markers and  <dig> common est-ssr .

efficiency of these markers in a comparative study depends largely upon how many of these markers will be mapped on the genetic maps and also on how well these markers will be distributed over the chromosomes. this also will define if the current number of markers is sufficient to carry out such a synteny study or that more markers should be generated.

CONCLUSIONS
 <dig> pyro-sequencing provides a rich resource for marker development and comparative genomic studies for species with an uncharacterized genome. large numbers of snps amendable for high throughput genotyping purposes were generated for each genotype providing a very rich resource for fast development of markers in lily and tulip. microsatellites that were mined and characterized for lily and tulip confirmed that there is a selection against di-nucleotide repeats in coding regions while tri-nucleotide repeats were equally spread over coding and utr regions. running comparative genomic analysis among lily, tulip, and rice not only identified genes that are shared among these three monocot species, but also identified a set of genes that are present in the two monocot flower bulb species but not in rice. studying this group of putative specific genes of flower bulbs may provide insight in the biology of these specialized monocots. to improve our understanding of evolutionary history  of the lily and tulip genomes, we identified common genetic loci with snp or ssr polymorphisms that can be used as marker in the available mapping populations for lily and tulip.
