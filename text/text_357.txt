BACKGROUND
campylobacter is a zoonotic pathogen naturally present in the gastrointestinal tract of many domestic animals and pets  <cit> . in denmark and in many other developed countries, campylobacter enteritis is the predominant food borne disease  <cit> . in denmark, fresh poultry meat has been identified as the main risk factor for human campylobacteriosis  <cit> . consumption of undercooked chicken meat and cross contamination with ready-to-eat foods through improper food handling contributes to human infections  <cit> . c. jejuni is the predominant species in broilers as well as in humans  <cit> . a danish surveillance study comparing campylobacter species in humans, domestic animals and food products revealed that 93% of the speciated isolates from humans were c. jejuni. among these, 63% belonged to the penner serotypes o: <dig> , o: <dig>  and o:4c , that likewise were the most frequent serotypes isolated from broilers , cattle , and food   <cit> . c. coli constituted  <dig> % of the human isolates. this species was occasionally found in poultry but predominantly found in pigs  <cit> . strategies to improve food safety by reducing the risk of campylobacter include efforts in the primary production, at the slaughter line, and at the consumer level  <cit> . risk assessments have suggested that one of the most efficient ways to reduce the incidence of campylobacteriosis is through methods that reduce numbers of campylobacter in poultry meat  <cit> . one such method is freezing, which has been shown to reduce the number of viable campylobacter cells approximately  <dig> fold  <cit> . unfortunately, frozen products do not suit the consumer demands for chilled products, that are ready to cook without thawing. therefore, other methods to control the level of campylobacter in the final product are required.

one potential strategy for controlling bacterial pathogens in food production is the application of virulent phages, viruses that can kill bacterial cells  <cit> . the phage reproduces inside the bacterial cell and cause it to lyse releasing progeny phage into the environment. phages possess several advantages compared to traditional antibiotics, including self-replication/self-limitation and selective modification of the bacterial flora  <cit> . most bacterial species are challenged by their own specific bacteriophages that seldom cross species barriers. campylobacter phages have been recovered from environments harboring campylobacter  <cit>  and seem to be a natural part of the intestinal flora of campylobacter colonized broilers  <cit> . to reduce numbers of campylobacter in chicken meat, the bacteriophages may be orally administrated to the broilers before slaughter or applied onto the meat after slaughter. studies have shown that the use of bacteriophages as biocontrolling agents significantly reduced campylobacter and salmonella shedding from live birds and contamination on chicken skin  <cit> .

one concern in relation to commercial use of bacteriophages in the chicken production is the narrow host range displayed by these viruses  <cit> . the host range of campylobacter phages has previously been investigated on strains representing the phage types of the united kingdom typing scheme, phage typed reference strains of human origin, and strains isolated during fieldwork for characterization  <cit> . even though the work has described phages by grouping them into different classes of lytic spectra and has reported qualitative information about the phages capability of killing campylobacter strains, a study combining epidemiological studies on campylobacter and phage host range has been missing.

the aim of this study was to isolate and characterize campylobacter specific phages from the danish poultry production  and investigate their effectiveness against the penner serotypes that are commonly present in poultry and humans in order to be able to select effective phages for future biocontrol.

RESULTS
isolation of phages
a total of  <dig> samples were collected and analyzed for campylobacter phages. as shown in table  <dig>   <dig> samples were isolated from broiler intestines. of these samples,  <dig> % originated from flocks that were recorded by the danish campylobacter surveillance program to be campylobacter positive. for the remaining samples  the flock status where not known. table  <dig> shows that the type of poultry  had greater influence on the phage isolation rate than sample type . the isolation rate from broiler samples was approximately 3%. however, phages could be isolated from approximately 50% of the duck samples, making ducks the best source for campylobacter phages in this study. of the four phages isolated from the intestine of broilers with known flock status, one phage  was isolated from a flock with a campylobacter negative status and the remaining  <dig> from flocks with a positive status. for initial phage isolation, campylobacter strains nctc  <dig> and  <dig> were used as hosts for all  <dig> samples. toward the end of the campylobacter season in denmark , strain nctc  <dig> was added as an additional isolation host for the last two collected samples, and phages were recovered from both of these. nctc  <dig> supported the isolation of 80% of the phages. strain  <dig> supported the isolation of one phage, f <dig>  which was isolated from the same sample as phage f <dig> . it was found that some of the phages, isolated from three independent broiler abattoir samples, were unstable during storage, therefore they were excluded from further investigation.

molecular characterization and transmission electron microscopy
the phages were analyzed by pfge and rea to determine genome size and sensitivity towards digestion with the restriction enzyme hhai. eventhough a signal were visible in the f <dig> well no dna were observed to enter the the pulsed field gel, which precluded estimation of the genome size. a prolonged running time of  <dig> h did not change the observed outcome for phage f <dig>  phage f <dig> displayed the largest genome  and the remaining phages had each an estimated genome size of approximately  <dig> kb . rea showed that the dna isolated from phage f <dig> could not be digested with hhai. an attempt to digest the expected f <dig> dna with hhai was unsuccesful, since dna bands still were absent in the gel . all phages with a genome size of ~ <dig> kb could be digested with hhai. each phage displayed between 2– <dig> strong bands in the pfge ranging in size between 9– <dig> kb . the rea allowed for categorizing the  <dig> kb phages into five different restriction patterns  .

six representatives of the isolated phages were further subjected to morphological studies by transmission electron microscopy . all had icosahedral heads and contractive tails, which place them into the family of myoviridae  <cit>  . the morphology and sizes of the selected phages were not significantly different from each other. the length of the phages was approximately  <dig> nm and the average diameter of the phage heads was approximately  <dig> nm.

analysis of phage host range
the host range was investigated by the selected campylobacter panel presented in table  <dig>  the c. jejuni serotypes most prevalent among human clinical isolates and broilers in denmark were each represented by 4– <dig> strains, and is referred to as the common serotypes. a selection of other serotypes were represented by one strain each, and are referred to as the less common serotypes. in total the phages were tested on  <dig> different serotypes of which seventeen were c. jejuni and seven were c. coli. of the c. jejuni strains tested in spot test 89% could be lysed by at least one of the phages, whereas only 14% of the c. coli strains could be lysed. the phages examined were generally well suited for infecting the campylobacter strains within the serotypes o: <dig> , o:  <dig> and o:4c, but showed less virulent towards the other c. jejuni serotypes tested, with exception of serotype 5j  and serotype  <dig>   that could be eliminated by  <dig> and  <dig> phages, respectively. the widest phage host range was achieved by phage f <dig>  which affected  <dig> of the  <dig> tested campylobacter strains, or  <dig> of the  <dig> serotypes. phage f <dig> had a diverging host range by being most effective in eliminating the campylobacter strains different from the o: <dig> ; o: <dig> and o:4c serotypes.

discussion
broilers have for other investigators been a fertile source for campylobacter phages  <cit> . in this study campylobacter phages were isolated much more frequently from ducks than from broilers, indicating that our method was best suited for the former purpose. several factors can influence the harvest of phages from a particular source. the choice of host is important, since the narrow host range characteristic of most phages can cause them to remain undetected in the screening process. to overcome this obstacle, the c. jejuni strain nctc  <dig>  known from the british phage typing system to be sensitive towards a broad range of phages  <cit> , was chosen as a host in this study. even though the nctc  <dig> strain, with regard to penner serotype, is not common in the danish broiler production, most of the isolated phages were detected by this strain  <cit> . however, the frequency of phage isolation from broilers was lower than previously reported from the united kingdom  <cit> . the two other campylobacter strains used for phage isolation  and nctc  <dig> ) represent common serotypes in danish poultry. however, although all samples were screened on strain  <dig>  only one phage was isolated. this is surprising since  <dig> proved sensitive to most of the phages. two samples were screened for phages on nctc  <dig>  and phages were isolated from both, indicating that an extended use of nctc  <dig> possibly would have resulted in more isolated phages. unfortunately, this strain was only included in the last two samples. finally it should be emphasized that only  <dig> % of the total investigated broiler flocks were campylobacter positive. this is likely to have had a negative impact on the quantity of phages isolated, since presence of a phage depends on the presence of a host in the environment.

our investigation, as well as results reported by other investigators indicate that a genome size of ~ <dig> kb is common for campylobacter phages, even though campylobacter phages with genomes ranging from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb have also been described  <cit> . despite several attempts, phage f <dig> was the only phage that failed to provide dna bands in this study, and thus the genome size could not be determined for this phage. unfortunately, we have not been able to clarify the reasons for this result. a signal, which could be due to the presence of nucleic acid or proteins, could be observed in the f <dig> well after running . however, if this were dna we would expect some dna movement into the gel, irrespective of genome size of the phage dna. we propose that the result can be due to lack of phage capside degradation during the preparation, which would result in a lack of free dna in the well. it should be noted that campylobacter phages that are unable to produce visible dna bands have previously been described by atterbury and co-workers  <cit> .

based on genome size and rea the phages were divided into three categories. i: phages with genome size of ~ <dig> kb and refractory to digestion with hhai ; ii: phages with genome size of ~ <dig> kb and digestible by hhai ; and iii: phage genome undetectable in the pfge . phages within each of these categories also displayed considerable differences in campylobacter host range. the category i phage infected mainly the less common serotypes in danish poultry, category ii phages mainly infected the common serotypes o: <dig> ; o: <dig>  o:4c, and finally the category iii phage had a broader host range and infected both strains with common serotype and some of those with a less common serotype. the ~ <dig> kb phages digested by hhai could be further classified into five groups having different rea patterns . there were no indications of special band patterns being connected to a particular source of isolation. all together we can distinguish between seven types of phages within the twelve isolated phages.

tem analysis of six phages, each representing one of the types of phage found in this study, showed that the phages all belonged to the family myoviridae and were of the same size as previously reported for campylobacter phages  <cit> .

the narrow host range often displayed by bacteriophages has been emphasized as an advantage in phage therapy, compared to chemical antibiotics, due to the limited adverse effect on the natural bacteria population  <cit> . on the other hand, a phage or a cocktail of phages marketed for commercial use should at least reduce the majority of the species to be controlled. the host range of category ii and iii phages reveals that they have potential to infect and lyse the penner serotype o: <dig> ; o: <dig> and o:4c. a product aimed at these serotypes will potentially be capable of reducing the campylobacter infections in approximately 60% of the infected broiler flocks in denmark  <cit> . in laboratory studies it is possible to reduce c. jejuni infections in broilers by 1– <dig> logs  <cit> . this is a reduction that can cause a considerable decrease in human infections  <cit> . it will be possible to enhance the host range by producing a mixture of several phages, for example by mixing phages from each of the three categories mentioned above.

coward et al.  <cit>  have suggested that phage sensitivity in campylobacter strains might in some cases be connected to the capsular polysaccharide  of the cell, which also is the serotypic determinant of the penner heat-stable serotyping system  <cit> . in our study there seem to be some correlation between phage sensitivity and serotype, especially for group ii. however this correlation is not conclusive.

CONCLUSIONS
we have characterized and identified the host range of  <dig> danish campylobacter phages. due to their ability to infect the common serotypes in denmark we suggest the phages can become an effective agent in the effort to reduce the incidence of campylobacteriosis in denmark. this study provides the basis for future experiments in campylobacter phages, and knowledge for the selection of campylobacter phages for biocontrol in broilers.
