BACKGROUND
recombinant protein production in mammalian cells is an important topic in biotechnology  <cit> . one of the critical steps in the production of recombinant proteins is the isolation of stable single cell clones expressing high levels of the protein of interest. commonly, this is achieved by random genomic integration of a vector containing a promoter, a gene of interest and a selectable marker. although this method is simple and straight forward, it lacks of reproducibility. expression from such vectors is substantially influenced by the surrounding chromatin to the integration site and tends to be silenced over time. this makes the selection of suitable clones a tedious and time consuming procedure  <cit> . several strategies have been developed to overcome the positional effects of the adjacent chromatin. for example, "anti-repressor" elements flanking the vectors  <cit>  have been used or vectors have been integrated specifically into chromosomal loci with open chromatin  <cit> . ideally, a vector for recombinant protein production should display three features: 1) expression should be independent of the integration site in the genome, 2) expression should correlate with the number of integrated transgene copies and 3) expression should be maintained over time. interestingly, large vectors that fulfill these criteria such as bacterial artificial chromosomes  have been widely used for generation of transgenic mice  <cit>  but not for production of recombinant proteins. bacs are vectors derived from the f factor of e. coli that are maintained as low copy replicons. bacs offer a clear advantage compared to "classical expression vectors": due to their large cloning capacity , bacs can accommodate most  of the elements that are responsible for the expression of a gene of interest. thus, bacs can be considered as complete expression units. consequently, expression from bacs based vector is less affected by the surrounding chromatin to their insertion site in a host genome. in this sense, bacs containing genes that are considered as open chromatin , such as rosa <dig>  β-actin, gapdh etc. are attractive tools in the field of eukaryotic recombinant protein production. on the other hand, due to their large size, bacs can not be manipulated using traditional cloning techniques. modification of bacs is done via homologous recombination in e. coli , however, there are several existing methods that allow to modify a bac via homologous recombination in e. coli, thus making the use of bacs as expression vectors a relative simple task  <cit> . in this work, we explore the suitability of a bac containing the rosa <dig> locus as expression vector applied to the production of the fc fragment of the constant region of human igg <dig> in hek  <dig> cells.

methods
plasmids and cell culture
the caggs fc expression vector was assembled by conventional cloning methods and is flanked by two attb sites . the rosa26bac caggs fc bac vector was generated as previously described  <cit> . briefly, the caggs fc vector was recombined into a bac containing the rosa <dig> locus using ɸc <dig> mediated cassette exchange into the exon  <dig> of the rosa <dig> antisense transcript.

to establish the bulk cultures,  <dig> μg caggs fc and rosa26bac caggs fc bac vectors were linearized with noti and transfected into hek  <dig> cells using lipofectamine  <dig> . two days after transfection, g <dig>  was added to the media . selection was carried out over  <dig> days. thereafter, all the cultures were grown in the absence of g <dig> and fc protein production in the bulk cultures was measured  <dig> week later.

human igg1-fc protein determination
 <dig> ×  <dig> cells were seeded into each single well of a  <dig> well plate in  <dig> ml of medium.  <dig> hours after seeding, the fc protein concentration was measured in the supernatants using an elisa assay. for the elisa, goat anti-human-igg  f <dig> fragment  was adsorbed at  <dig> μg/ml onto microwells of a maxisorp plate over night at 4°c, followed by blocking with 5% bsa in pbs for  <dig> h at 25°c. after washing, the samples and the standard, respectively, were added in dilution series to the blocked microwells and incubated for  <dig> h at 25°c. the plate was washed and bound fc was detected by protein a – hrp  diluted 1: <dig> in pbs/bsa followed by staining with tmb substrate solution . the elisa was measured at  <dig> nm with the reference wavelength  <dig> nm.

rosa26bac caggs fc copy number analysis
the rosa26bac caggs fc culture was enriched twice using eyfp facs sorting. single clones were established using a dilution technique. cells were seeded in  <dig> well plates at  <dig>  cells per well. clones were expanded progressively up to  <dig> cm dish, at this point , cells were considered passage  <dig>  during subcloning, expansion and subsequence analysis of the cultures no selective pressure was used. the number of transgene copies in the single cell clones  was quantified by real time pcr with genomic dna as template. the rosa <dig> bac was amplified with oligos rosaf 5' tcttgtccttttacctcccttgta rosar 5' gaacatattcaaaacaccaggattt. these oligos recognize a sequence that is identical in the rosa <dig> bac  and in the endogenous rosa <dig> locus . the β-actin locus was amplified with oligos, actinf 5' tcatgtttgagaccttcaacacc and actinr 5' gatcttcatgaggtagtcagtcaggt as internal control to normalize the amount of genomic dna used.

RESULTS
in order to test the efficacy of bacs in the production of recombinant proteins, we have generated two expression vectors: the caggs fc vector, which consists of a caggs promoter  <cit> , the fc fragment  of human igg <dig> as gene of interest  containing a leader peptide for secretion  <cit> , an ires/eyfp reporter and a pgk-neomycin cassette. the second vector, rosa26bac caggs fc, consists of the caggs fc vector that has been recombined into a bac backbone containing the rosa <dig> locus . hek  <dig> cells were transfected with the caggs fc and the rosa26bac caggs fc vectors. after  <dig> days of g <dig> selection we obtained more than  <dig> g <dig> resistant clones for the caggs fc vector and 200– <dig> with the rosa26bac caggs fc vector. cells from each culture were pooled and two bulk cultures for the caggs fc and rosa26bac caggs fc vectors respectively were established. analysis of the fc protein production in the supernatants showed a yield of  <dig>  and  <dig>  pg/cell/day in the caggs fc and the rosa26bac caggs fc bulk cultures, respectively , demonstrating that the use of a bac-based vector improves the protein production substantially.

next, we analyzed the correlation between the number of transgene copies and the fc protein yield.  <dig> subclones were established from the of rosa26bac caggs fc culture that harbored  <dig> to  <dig> copies of the transgene. protein yield in the supernatants of these cultures correlated with the transgene copy numbers and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> pg/cell/day . the correlation coefficient r <dig> between the copy number of the bac vector and protein production was  <dig> . this suggests that the protein production is proportional to the number of integrated transgene copies when using a bac-based expression vector.

finally, we investigated long-term protein production over time and increasing passage numbers.  <dig> subclones from the rosa26bac caggs fc culture were grown for  <dig> passages and protein production was analyzed. the yield of the fc protein was not significantly decreasing from passage  <dig> to passage  <dig>  indicating that bac-based vectors provide stable long-term production of recombinant proteins.

discussion
in this work, we have used a bac containing the rosa <dig> locus for protein production. the rosa <dig> locus is considered to be a region of open chromatin  and has been successfully used to express genes of interest in transgenic mice  <cit> . with this approach, we have shown that a bac-based vector improves recombinant protein production substantially when compared to a conventional vector. further improvements of bac-based vectors for recombinant protein production could include the use of endogenous/natural promoters that are highly active in the producer cell. for example, a transcriptional profiling of hek  <dig> cells has identified strong expression levels of the rpl23a gene which encodes a ribosomal protein  <cit> . therefore, the use of a bac containing the rpl23a locus in hek  <dig> cells could further improve recombinant protein production.

CONCLUSIONS
the rosa <dig> bac fulfills the ideal characteristic of an expression vector applied to protein production in stable cell lines. it increases protein production by a factor of  <dig> when compared to a conventional vector and it confers copy number dependent and stable protein expression. these results suggest that bac-based expression vectors overcome negative effects of the surrounding chromatin at the transgene integration site. consequently, bac-based expression vectors represent an important tool to improve recombinant protein production.
