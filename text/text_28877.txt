BACKGROUND
in contrast to animals, plant development is highly plastic, with new organs being formed continuously from pools of stem cells maintained in structures called meristems. this plasticity allows plants, within certain limits, to adapt their body shape in response to developmental, physical and environmental cues. the ability to form new organs throughout their life cycle requires tight control of the meristems to avoid unregulated growth. plants have evolved an elaborate genetic network that controls meristem size and maintenance  <cit> . at the core of the network that regulates the size of the stem cell population in the shoot meristem are the homeodomain transcription factor wuschel  and the clavata  ligand-receptor system  <cit> . wus is expressed in the organizing centre  of the meristem and positively regulates clv <dig> expression in the stem cells, which are localized above the oc  <cit> . clv <dig> encodes a small secreted peptide, which cell non-autonomously represses wus in the oc  <cit> . it has recently been shown, that clv <dig> directly binds to the ectodomain of the lrr receptor kinase clv <dig>  <cit> . similarly, it has been suggested that the receptor-like protein clv <dig> interacts with the novel receptor kinase coryne  to establish a functional clv <dig> receptor  <cit> . thus a feedback loop is established, which is essential to set up and maintain the stem cell population at the shoot meristem. however, the relationship between wus and clv <dig> is not static; the wus-clv system can compensate for changes in clv <dig> expression over a wide range  <cit> .

wus expression is also controlled by phytohormones, which have been implicated in maintaining the stem cell system as well as setting up developmental compartments at the shoot meristem and in establishing the developmental fate of cells that are derived from the stem cell pool . besides hormones, sugars also appear to play an important role in establishing and maintaining meristem identity . for example, it has been shown that growth arrest caused by loss of the wus-related homeodomain factor stimpy/wox <dig> was rescued to a large extent by providing sucrose in the growth medium. this demonstrates that sucrose can compensate for the loss of at least some genes normally required for meristem development  <cit> .

here we present an initial characterization of a plant-specific gene family - fantastic four  - with four members in arabidopsis thaliana . we show that the faf genes are expressed throughout the life cycle of the plant, but exhibit strong temporal and spatial regulation. faf <dig> and faf <dig> expression was detected in the centre of the shoot meristem by rna in situ hybridization and gus reporter constructs. in addition, expression of the faf genes was detectable in the developing and mature vasculature. faf gene overexpression negatively affected growth of both the shoot and the root. at the molecular level, the arrest of shoot growth was accompanied by a marked decrease in wus expression. we further show that meristematic expression of faf <dig> and faf <dig> is under negative control by clv <dig>  together these data suggest that the faf proteins are capable of modulating shoot growth by repressing wus in the oc of the shoot meristem.

RESULTS
the fantastic four  genes define a plant specific gene family
the arabidopsis thaliana faf genes first caught our attention because two of them, faf <dig>  and faf <dig> , responded strongly and rapidly to a shift in photoperiod in a microarray experiment   <cit> . faf <dig> and faf <dig> belong to an uncharacterized gene family that also includes faf <dig> and faf <dig> . both pairs of genes, arabidopsis thaliana faf1/faf <dig> and faf3/faf <dig>  appear to be recently duplicated paralogs  <cit> . the proteins encoded by the faf genes do not contain any domains of known function . in addition, the arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes a more distantly related protein , which we call faf-like . faf and faf-like proteins share several conserved domains, among them a stretch of acidic residues in their c-terminal half.

since the faf genes have not been previously described, we wished to determine how widespread they are among other species. to address this question we searched publicly available sequence databases by reciprocal blast analysis for potential orthologs of the faf genes. phylogenetic analysis suggests that the faf genes originated from a faf-like gene and that today's faf genes arose through several rounds of duplications within the dicotyledonous plants . faf genes were not apparent in the rice genome or any other monocotyledonous species, even though proteins sharing homology with the arabidopsis thaliana faf-like gene were clearly present . sequence homology searches failed to identify any potentially homologous proteins outside the plant kingdom, indicating that the faf gene family is plant-, possibly eudicotyledonous-specific.

expression of faf genes throughout development
in order to determine the temporal and spatial regulation of the expression of the four faf genes throughout development, we consulted the atgenexpress arabidopsis thaliana expression atlas  <cit> . all four faf transcripts were detectable throughout development . expression of faf <dig> and faf <dig> at the shoot apex increased during the transition to flowering, while faf <dig> and faf <dig> decreased, confirming the results observed in the first microarray dataset . however, faf <dig> and faf <dig> exhibited strong differences in their expression profiles in other tissues. for example, while faf <dig> and faf <dig> were both highly expressed in the apical region during the floral transition, only faf <dig> expression was maintained at high levels during later stages of flower development, especially in carpels. in contrast, faf <dig> expression appeared to be more transient, with some expression maintained in stamens. similarly to faf <dig>  faf <dig> was expressed in stamens, but was also strongly expressed in the youngest leaves formed by the plant . this expression, however, disappeared as the leaves aged. expression of all four faf genes was detectable in young siliques, but expression faded as seed maturation progressed. taken together, our analysis of microarray data showed that the faf genes are dynamically expressed throughout development.

faf genes are expressed in the centre of the shoot meristem and in vascular tissue
to analyze faf expression at cellular resolution, we carried out rna in situ hybridization . expression of all four faf genes was detected in provascular and vascular tissue at different stages throughout development. faf <dig> and faf <dig> were only weakly expressed in the vasculature of vegetative plants . in addition to the vasculature, faf <dig> mrna was also detectable in the centre of the vegetative meristem . in contrast, faf <dig> and faf <dig> could easily be detected in the vasculature , but neither seemed to be expressed in the vegetative meristem .

expression of the faf genes changed upon the onset of flowering , as already observed in the microarray experiments . faf <dig> and faf <dig> were induced in the inflorescence vasculature and young flower buds as flowering commenced . in contrast, faf <dig> and faf <dig> expression in inflorescences was restricted to the vasculature, but was largely absent from young flowers . both, faf <dig> and faf <dig> were, however, detected in the centre of the inflorescence meristem .

upon fertilization, expression of faf <dig>  faf <dig>  faf <dig>  but not faf <dig> could also be detected in the developing embryo, starting from the early heart stage and lasting until torpedo stage . faf <dig> expression was, however, detectable in the funiculus .

the dynamic nature of faf gene regulation was confirmed by the dramatic changes in reporter gene activity observed during the first  <dig> days after germination . faf1::gus activity, for example, was initially restricted to the hypocotyl, but expression gradually shifted to the root over the following four days. starting on day  <dig>  faf1::gus became active in the vasculature of the cotyledons and subsequently also in the leaves. similar, but distinct, dynamic regulation of reporter gene activity could also be observed for the other faf promoters . in addition, faf2::gus was observed in the centre of the vegetative shoot meristem  as already shown by rna in situ hybridization . after the onset of flowering, faf1::gus was observed most strongly in anthers , while faf2::gus expression was strongest in the carpel, particularly in the funiculus , where faf <dig> rna had also been detected . faf3::gus activity was restricted to anthers , whereas faf <dig> was expressed at the base of the flower and in the vasculature of the pedicels and the inflorescence stem . in differentiated tissues such as root and leaves, the faf genes were predominantly expressed in the phloem, as shown for faf <dig> .

in summary, faf <dig> and faf <dig> are expressed in the centre of the shoot meristem, suggesting a potential role for these two faf proteins in meristem development. in addition, all faf genes are expressed in the vasculature, where they may function in a partially redundant manner.

faf proteins can affect growth and meristem size
to study the function of the faf proteins during development, we first searched for knock-out lines . most of the lines investigated showed either wild-type mrna levels, indicating that expression of the corresponding faf gene was unaltered in these lines or the presence of the t-dna could not be confirmed or the lines were not available from the stock centre. only for faf <dig> a potential rna-null line  could be recovered. this line, however, did not show an obvious phenotype, possibly due to redundancy with the other faf genes. attempts to knock-down individual or certain combinations of faf genes by constitutive and inducible rnai  resulted in pleiotropic phenotypes in all t <dig> lines investigated. unfortunately, all lines that eventually did set seeds were silenced in t <dig>  making further analysis impracticable. besides regular rnai, artificial micrornas  were prepared to knock-down faf mrnas either individually or in combination, but these did not result in a significant degradation of the targeted transcripts and lines showed no discernable phenotypes  <cit> . finally, tilling of faf genes  also failed to produce alleles with major changes such as premature stop codons  <cit> .

given the difficulty of obtaining loss-of-function lines, we resorted to misexpression experiments. we constitutively expressed faf genes under the control of the viral  <dig> s promoter in planta. in general we observed similar phenotypes, regardless of which faf gene was overexpressed, indicating that all four faf proteins can perform the same function. lines expressing faf genes at a very high level, as determined by qrt-pcr , arrested shoot growth shortly after germination . arrest this early in development was observed in 2%  to 12%  of independent t <dig> lines .

the strongest lines were sterile, therefore we focused our analysis on those plants with intermediate expression levels , for which stable lines could be established. in these lines we observed a strong reduction in root growth  when compared to wild-type plants . this was accompanied by an increased formation of adventitious roots at the hypocotyl. the arrest of the root growth could be overcome when 1% sucrose was supplied in the medium .

moderate faf overexpressing plants were smaller than wild-type, and leaf vasculature appeared to be reduced . apart from this they developed normally, until after the transition to flowering and bolting, at which point inflorescence meristems ceased producing new organs and shoot elongation stopped . in the last flowers to be formed before the meristem arrested, floral organs, in particular the stamens and carpel, were retarded in development . when we examined the meristems in more detail , we found that the width of the inflorescence meristems in faf overexpressing lines was on average reduced by approximately 30% when compared to wild-type .

faf proteins can repress wuschel in the organizing centre of the shoot meristem
loss of wus function results in a reduction of meristem size, similar to what we observed in faf overexpressing lines. moreover, two faf genes are expressed in the centre of the meristem, overlapping with the site of wus expression in the oc. this prompted us to analyze expression of wus in the meristem of faf overexpressing lines . we found that wus expression was strongly reduced in both inflorescence and flower meristems. since wus is required for maintenance of meristem function, the reduction in wus expression is consistent with the meristem arrest phenotype seen in strong  and moderate  faf overexpressing plants.

expression of wus in the oc of the shoot meristem is under negative control of clv3-dependent signalling. we found that clv <dig> expression was essentially normal in faf overexpressing lines , indicating that the reduction in wus expression was not caused by an increase or expansion of clv <dig> expression.

repression of faf <dig> and faf <dig> in the shoot meristem by clavata3
the fact that wus expression is reduced in faf overexpressing lines suggested that faf <dig> and faf <dig>  which are normally expressed in the meristem, might be involved in the clv <dig> mediated repression of wus. we therefore analyzed faf <dig> and faf <dig> expression in clv3- <dig> mutants . we found that expression of faf <dig> was strongly enhanced in the centre of clv3- <dig> inflorescence meristems , while its expression in the vasculature appeared to be not affected. although meristems are enlarged in clv3- <dig> mutants, the simple increase in cell number does not explain the strong staining observed, suggesting that faf <dig> is under repression by clv <dig>  similarly, we found faf <dig> to be expressed more strongly in the enlarged centre of clv3- <dig> meristems , though the increase was not as pronounced as for faf <dig>  in order to confirm the upregulation of faf <dig> and faf <dig> in the inflorescence meristem of clv3- <dig> mutants, we analyzed microarray expression data of col- <dig> and clv3- <dig> inflorescence meristems from the atgenexpress transcriptome atlas. we found significant  and strong induction of faf <dig>  and faf <dig>  in clv3- <dig> inflorescence meristems when compared to col- <dig> control plants . confirming the quality of the array data, wus was also found to be significantly and strongly  induced in the clv3- <dig> mutant. neither faf <dig> nor faf <dig> changed significantly and strongly  in the clv3- <dig> microarray data set.

the observed upregulation of faf <dig> and faf <dig> in clv3- <dig> inflorescence meristems could either indicate that these two faf genes are under repression by clv <dig> or that they are positively regulated by wus. to be able to distinguish between these two possibilities we examined the response of faf genes to inducible ectopic wus expression in a microarray dataset from 12-day-old seedlings  <cit> . we found that none of the faf genes were induced, suggesting that they are not positively regulated by wus but are more likely to be under repression by clv <dig> .

taken together, our results indicate that faf proteins, when expressed at high levels, can affect shoot meristem size in arabidopsis thaliana by modulating clv3-dependent wus expression. in wild-type plants, only faf <dig> and faf <dig> are likely to participate in the regulation of wus since only these two genes are normally expressed in the centre of the shoot meristem. in addition, faf <dig> and faf <dig> expression in the meristem appears to be under negative control by the clv <dig>  however, the observation that constitutive expression of any of the four fafs can affect meristem size demonstrates that the ability to repress wus is intrinsic to all four faf proteins.

discussion
the shoot apical meristem is initiated early during embryogenesis and harbours a small population of pluripotent stem cells from which all aerial parts of the plant are derived  <cit> . establishment and maintenance of these stem cells depends on the activity of the wus and clv genes, which are mutually regulating each other's expression in a spatial negative feedback loop  <cit> . wus expression in the oc of the shoot meristem promotes stem cell fate in the cells above while the stem cells themselves secrete a small peptide, clv <dig>  which is perceived by clv <dig> and, possibly, the clv2/crn receptor complex  <cit> . ultimately, clv3-dependent signalling limits the size of the wus-expressing oc. the wus-clv system is rather dynamic and can, over time, compensate for even 10-fold differences in clv <dig> expression, indicating that clv <dig> expression confers information about stem-cell position to the underlying oc rather than information about stem cell number  <cit> .

analysis of faf overexpressing lines by rna in situ hybridization demonstrated that wus was strongly downregulated in these lines. the fact that the expression of wus was affected regardless of which faf gene was constitutively expressed, suggests that the ability to repress wus is intrinsic to all four faf proteins. in wild-type, faf effects on wus are likely to be exerted only by faf <dig> and faf <dig>  which are the two faf genes expressed in the centre of the shoot and/or inflorescence meristem in a domain that appears to be overlapping with the site of wus expression.

in the clv3- <dig> mutant the expression domains of wus and faf2/faf <dig> appear to be largely exclusive. wus is limited to the second meristem layer  but is no longer detectable in the centre of the meristem  <cit> . in contrast, expression of faf <dig> and faf <dig> were found to be upregulated in the centre of the meristem but are mostly excluded from the l <dig>  this suggests that in wild-type expression of faf2/faf <dig> might attenuate wus expression in the centre of the meristem whereas high levels of faf2/faf <dig> in clv3- <dig> prevent wus from being expressed in the centre of the meristem and limit its expression to the l <dig>  based on our results, we propose that faf genes function in the shoot meristem, with clv <dig> negatively regulating faf <dig> and faf <dig> expression, which in turn contribute to the repression of wus. in this context it is interesting to note that all four faf proteins harbour a short sequence motif  that is reminiscent of the ear repression motif  <cit> . this would be in agreement with the proposed role of faf proteins as repressors of wus.

expression of faf <dig> and faf <dig> in the centre of the meristem would put them in place to compensate for the effects of positive regulators such as stimpy on wus expression in the oc. interestingly, we found that clv <dig> expression was not decreased in faf overexpression lines, even though wus levels were severely reduced. expression of wus in the oc is under constant surveillance by several other positive and negative regulators . for example, in jba- <dig> d plants, a mutant in which the mir166g is overexpressed, wus expression is highly induced, while the relative level of clv <dig> transcription remains unchanged compared with wild-type plants  <cit> . these observations together with data presented here suggest that the expression of clv <dig> is maintained over a wide range of wus levels, similar to what has been shown for the effect of clv <dig> on wus  <cit> . in addition, several other transcription factors, as well as a number of proteins involved in chromatin remodelling, have been shown to regulate wus. having established the faf proteins as negative regulators of wus, it will be interesting to analyze possible genetic interactions between the faf genes and the other wus regulators in detail.

wus is not only expressed in the oc of the shoot meristem, but also in young flower meristems, where it directly regulates expression of the homeotic gene agamous  in the centre of the newly formed flower  <cit> . ag is normally required for the development of the inner two whorls of the flower  <cit> . reduction of wus expression in the flower meristem could result in a downregulation of ag, which could explain the observed defects in flowers of faf overexpressing plants.

apart from defects in the shoot meristem, faf overexpression resulted in an arrested root meristem. this finding suggests that the faf proteins can influence meristem maintenance at both poles of the growing plant. since wus is not expressed in the root meristem, it will be interesting to investigate, which wox gene takes on its function in the root. stimpy , a homeodomain transcription factor related to wus, has recently been shown to promote wus expression in the vegetative shoot meristem  <cit> . based on the severity of loss-of-function alleles on both the shoot and the root meristems, stip seems to play a more general role in meristem maintenance than wus. in this context it is interesting to note that, similar to faf overexpression, loss of stip function can be compensated for by exogenous sucrose, which is in agreement with the proposed function for stip in maintaining cell division. this suggests that stip and the fafs might have opposing functions in integrating sugar signalling into the meristem maintenance network.

the faf proteins are likely to have functions other than meristem maintenance since all are expressed in vascular tissue. consistent with a functional role for the fafs in these tissues, we observed a reduction of tertiary and quaternary vein formation in faf overexpressing lines . it has been reported that clv <dig> and a clv1-like gene are expressed in the phloem and cambium. also, two members of the clavata3/esr-related  family, cle <dig> and cle <dig>  are preferentially expressed in the phloem and/or the cambium  <cit> , and it has recently been shown that application of dodecapeptides with two hydroxyproline residues encoded by the cle gene family suppress xylem cell differentiation and promote cell division in zinnia cell cultures  <cit> . thus it seems possible that fafs affect vascular development by a mechanism similar to the one we propose for faf function in the shoot meristem. in such a scenario the faf proteins would act as general repressors of cell division in both the cambium and the root and shoot meristem, but are themselves under the control of the different clavata/cle proteins. taken together our findings suggest that faf proteins might act as transcriptional regulators, the question how exactly they exert their function remains to be determined.

CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates that the four arabidopsis thaliana faf genes most likely arose from the faf-like gene present in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant species, through two rounds of gene duplications. the expression of the faf genes is under developmental regulation and individual faf genes are expressed in distinct, though overlapping domains. the latter suggests that the faf proteins might act partially redundant, which would explain why t-dna insertion lines  were indistinguishable from wild-type plants. consistent with a certain amount of redundancy among the faf genes, rnai and artificial micrornas to knock-down individual or at maximum two faf genes also did not result in any consistent and reproducible phenotypes. based on the expression of faf <dig> and faf <dig> in the centre of the shoot apex, however, we assume a role of these two members of the faf family in the shoot meristem. supporting this idea was the finding that constitutive overexpression of the faf genes resulted in a marked reduction of meristem size. in addition, expression of wus, a central player in the regulation of meristem size was strongly reduced in the faf misexpression lines. finally, expression of faf <dig> and faf <dig> themselves appear to be under the control of the wus-clv <dig> feedback loop, as these two faf genes were strongly induced in the meristem of a clv <dig> mutant. taken together, our data suggest a scenario in which faf <dig> and faf <dig> modulate meristem size while the function of the other two faf genes remains to be investigated.
