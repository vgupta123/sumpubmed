BACKGROUND
leptospira, a slender and flexuous spirochaete with tight coils, contribute to leptospirosis  <cit> . the leptospira genus has been divided into  <dig> species based on dna-dna hybridization studies. pathogenic species include l. interrogans, l. kirschneri, l. noguchii, l. borgpetersenii, l. weilii, l. santarosai, l. alexanderi and l. alstonii  <cit> . leptospira can also be classified into about  <dig> serovars based on the lipopolysaccharide  structure. antigenically related serovars have been grouped into at least  <dig> serogroups  <cit> .

leptospirosis exists widely in both temperate and tropical climates and has become a serious public health threat in both developed and developing countries. human infection results from exposure to the urine of infected animals, either directly or via contaminated soil or water <cit> . the clinical manifestations of human leptospirosis are highly variable, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to severe forms of infection with jaundice, pulmonary hemorrhage, multiple organ failure  and even death  <cit> . different clinical characteristics and maintenance hosts are usually associated with certain serovars  <cit> . therefore, the serology based taxonomic unit is essential for epidemiology studies, diagnosis and prevention strategies. however, leptospira serotyping is performed by microscopic agglutination test  using antisera raised in rabbits against the corresponding standard references strains. this typing method is laborious and time consuming  <cit> .

chemical, immunochemical and ultrastructural data on lps show that the epitope for serovar specificity is the o-antigen  <cit> . recently, the o-antigen gene cluster of gram-negative bacteria has been intensively studied. these genes encode proteins involved in the biosynthesis of the o-antigen and can be divided into three groups  <cit> . they are nucleotide sugars precursors' biosynthesis genes, glycosyltransferase genes and the o-antigen processing genes. these genes are generally found on the chromosome as an o-antigen gene  cluster. o-genotyping has been used successfully in several bacteria genus, such as e. coli  <cit> , s. enterica  <cit> , s. boydii  <cit> , and y. pseudotuberculosis  <cit> . target genes of these kinds of methods are mainly the second and the third group genes that encode glycosyltransferase and o-antigen processing proteins.

dna-based typing methods, including variable-number tandem-repeat  typing  <cit> , insertion-sequence -based typing  <cit> , pulsed-filed gel electrophoresis   <cit> , restriction fragment length polymorphism <cit>  and randomly amplified polymorphic dna  <cit>  have also been employed for the discrimination of serogroups of leptospira. compared with o-genotyping method, the results of these methods are not easy to analyze. lacking of sequences of o-antigen gene clusters from various serogroups, this kind of o-genotyping has not been developed in leptospira, however.

it has been confirmed that genetic variation in the o-antigen gene cluster underlies the structural variation in the o-antigen  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that o-antigen gene clusters of representative strains from different serogroups of leptospira were not conservative, especially in the 5'-proximal end  <cit> . in this research, we sequenced the o-antigen gene cluster of four representative strains belonging to more epidemic serogroups  in china  <cit> . analyzing the o-antigen gene clusters of  <dig> sequenced strains , we developed simple and practical pcr assays for six epidemic serogroups in china  <cit>  that target serogroup-specific genes and employed to identify strains isolated from clinical samples.

RESULTS
mat
all strains, including  <dig> reference strains and  <dig> isolated strains, were tested by mat with standard rabbit serum. the results are shown in additional file  <dig> table s <dig> and additional file  <dig> table s <dig>  the serology results for all reference strains are consistent with those of the national institute for the control of pharmaceutical and biological products. of the  <dig> isolated strains,  <dig> strains belong to serogroup icterohaemorrhagiae,,  <dig> strains belong to serogroup autumnalis,  <dig> strains belong to serogroup grippotyphosa,  <dig> strain belongs to serogroup hebdomadis and  <dig> strains belong to serogroup sejroe.  <dig> isolated strains were validated by mat as serogroup ballum, australis, javanica and sarmin, respectively. six strains were unable to be classified. none of strains belong to serogroup canicola

development of pcr-based assays
we assigned functions of all orfs by comparing homology genes. most of predicted proteins are shown to be related to o-antigen biosynthesis except for some hypothetical proteins .

for typing bacteria, several different approaches have been used in leptospira. serological typing is based on strain to strain differences in the structure of lipopolysaccharide, mainly in the structure of the o-antigen. recently, pcr-based typing methods targeting specific genes were employed for dicrimination certain serogroups of several bacteria  <cit> . these targeted genes are mainly those encoding glycosyltransferase and enzymes involved in o-antigen assembly. among them, two highly specific genes: wzx  and wzy , are o-genotyping targets, usually. previous analysis of the o-antigen of leptospira showed that the biosynthesis of lps in leptospira is a wzy-dependent pathway  <cit> . in conjunction with published data  <cit> , our comparison of the o-antigen clusters in all  <dig> strains shows that the wzy protein has a high identity among the different serogroups. similarly, wzx shows high similarity across other serogroups . so we discarded these two genes as pcr assays targets.

to identify highly specific genes for pcr typing, we analyzed all predicted orfs by the blast program. first, we selected genes that exhibit less than 70% amino acid similarity with their counterpart genes. second, we compared these selected genes with draft data generated by  <dig> sequencing and discarded genes with more than 70% nucleotide similarity to any sequence in the draft data. in silico analysis of sequence of o-antigen clusters in  <dig> representative strains  showed that several glycosyltransferase genes and sugar synthesis genes may be serogroup-specific. primer pairs were designed to target these genes and pcr were performed.

analyzing the pcr products, we excluded primer pairs that could generate false-positive results in strains belonging to other serogroups and selected primer pairs that could discriminate as many strains belonging to the serogroups to be tested as possible. the primer pairs listed in table  <dig> were our final selections. as shown in fig.  <dig>  dna from strains belonging to the corresponding serogroups were able to produce pcr products of the expected size, but no pcr products were obtained from strains belonging to all other serogroups. the results of  <dig> reference strains are listed in additional file  <dig> table s <dig>  we also tested the specificity of six primer pairs using  <dig> clinically isolated strains; the results are listed in additional file  <dig> table s <dig>  all strains belonging to the six serogroups gave pcr products of the expected size with the exception of four reference strains  belonging to the serogroup sejroe. we speculate that the o-antigen gene clusters of these strains have been undertaken a process of recombination, where target genes may lose through recombination events. since a few sequences of o-antigen gene clusters from leptospira are available, only six serogroups of strains have been discriminated so far. there are also six strains cannot be discriminated by both mat and o-genotyping in clinical isolates. we proposed that they are from other serogroups which beyond the field we can characterize.

CONCLUSIONS
we found that six o-antigen-specific genes can be used to discriminate certain serogroups. we verified this dna-based typing approach, which based on detecting leptospira o-antigen-encoding genes, as a credible and convenient method for epidemiological research. to our knowledge, this work is the first to discriminate serogroups of leptospira based on the presence or absence of a pcr product.
