BACKGROUND
rad <dig>   <cit> , smc <dig>  smc <dig> and scc <dig> are the core subunits of a complex required for sister chromatid cohesion  <cit> . sister chromatid cohesion in budding yeast is established during late g <dig> and s phase  <cit>  and is abolished during the metaphase/anaphase transition, to allow the correct and timely mitotic sister chromatid segregation  <cit> . sister chromatid cohesion is also established de novo during the g2/m diploid phases when dna dsb are formed  <cit> . this de novo cohesion induced by dna dsb occurs in budding yeast on a genome-wide scale  <cit> . in contrast, in human cells at the g <dig> phase, the rad <dig> cohesin is recruited and targeted specifically to the vicinity of the dna dsb loci  <cit> . it has been proposed that the de novo cohesion establishment tethers the dna dsb damaged strand with its identical and intact sister chromatid counterpart to promote error-free dna repair  <cit> .

dna dsb can be repaired via different dna repair pathways such as the error-free homologous recombination  pathway, which requires a homologous dna strand template for repair, or via other alternative dna dsb repair pathways that do not require a homologous template. the latter, such as the canonical non-homologous end-joining , the single strand annealing and the micro-homology end-joining dna repair pathways are mostly error-prone  <cit> . in imbibed seeds, for example, dna dsb can be repaired via different dna dsb repair pathways. accordingly, mutations that affect either hr or c-nhej have been reported to cause loss of viability, or developmental delay, in seedlings germinated from imbibed mutants seeds of arabidopsis thaliana  and maize exposed to dna dsb damage inducing agents  <cit> .

other than triggering de novo cohesion, dna dsb damage also triggers changes in gene expression. some of the arabidopsis genes that code for proteins required at the early stages of hr repair of dna dsb, such as atrad <dig>  atbrca <dig>  atrpa-related, atgr1/com1/ctip and gmi <dig>  increase gene expression after dna dsb induction  <cit> . yet, not all arabidopsis genes involved in hr, namely atrad <dig> and atnbs <dig> , are transcriptionally responsive to dna dsb damage  <cit> . dna dsb damage also induces increase of the expression levels of the atwee <dig>  cycb1: <dig> and atrad <dig>  genes that are involved in cell cycle arrest at g <dig>  <cit> . this dna dsb induced g <dig> cell cycle arrest is detected mainly in meristems  <cit> . the observed increase of steady-state transcript levels, induced by dna dsb, of the genes mentioned above and of atrad <dig>  is mediated by the atm kinase  <cit> .

arabidopsis has three rad <dig> homologous genes; atrad <dig> /syn <dig>  atrad <dig> .2/syn <dig> and atrad <dig> /syn <dig>  <cit> . atrad <dig>  transcripts are detected in low levels in most plant tissues  <cit> , yet in the shoot apex and particularly in seeds , higher levels of atrad <dig>  transcript can be found  <cit> . atrad <dig>  transcripts become more abundant upon dna dsb induction, in an atm dependent manner, after dna dsb induction  <cit> . the detection of higher atrad <dig>  expression levels in seeds and the shoot apical apex is particularly interesting since these contain actively dividing meristem cells where maintenance of genomic integrity is crucial. like atrad <dig> , the atrad <dig>  gene is also expressed in different tissues at low levels  <cit> . yet, and unlike atrad <dig> , atrad <dig>  steady-state transcript levels have been shown not to increase in response to dna dsb damage induction  <cit> . in contrast, the cohesin atrad <dig>  exhibits the highest steady-state transcript levels of all atrad <dig> genes  <cit> . atrad <dig>  has been shown to play a role in genome stability and to be associated with replication factors  <cit> . indeed, the atrad <dig>  mutant experiences genomic instability  and chromatid alignment defects  <cit> , yet, unlike the atrad <dig>  mutant, the atrad <dig>  single mutant has not been reported to be associated with dna dsb damage repair nor to exhibit a dna dsb damage hypersensitivity phenotype  <cit> . however, and unexpectedly, atrad <dig>  is involved in dna dsb damage repair.

here, we report for the first time that atrad <dig> , like atrad <dig> , also plays a role in somatic dna dsb repair. both atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  single mutants have a higher basal level of dna dsb, in comparison to wild-type columbia- <dig> . additionally, the atrad <dig>  mutation also affects the kinetics of dna dsb damage repair after the induction of dna dsb. furthermore, the combination of both mutations renders the imbibed seeds of the atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  double mutant more hypersensitive to dna dsb induction than the atrad <dig>  and the atrad <dig>  single mutants.

we also show that the emergency-like atrad <dig>  gene expression response to dna damage is triggered immediately and abruptly after the induction of dna dsb.

RESULTS
the atrad <dig>  complementation construct is sufficient to promote resistance to ionising radiation-induced damage in imbibed seeds
the atrad <dig>  mutation  renders arabidopsis imbibed seeds hypersensitive to dna dsb-inducing agents  <cit> . to establish that the described phenotype is caused by the atrad <dig>  mutation alone, and not derived from chromosomal rearrangement or the disruption of another gene not physically linked to the t-dna insertion  <cit> , atrad <dig>  mutant plants were transformed with the complementation construct.

to obtain the complementation construct, the genomic region comprising the atrad <dig>  gene and its  <dig>  bp upstream sequence, was amplified as a single pcr product and cloned. sequencing of the genomic complementation construct confirmed that the coding sequence in the construct is identical to the coding sequence of the atrad <dig>  wild-type allele. sequencing also confirmed that the complementation construct atrad <dig>  gene sequence is cloned in frame with the epitope-tags gfp-6xhis .

the transformation of atrad <dig>  homozygous plants with the complementation construct yielded, at least, nine independently transformed complementation lines . five of these lines were further analysed and shown to rescue the atrad <dig>  mutant phenotype, exhibiting wild-type-like resistance to a dose of 150 gy  of ionising radiation . these plants were genotyped and confirmed to carry the complementation construct and the atrad <dig>  mutant allele . hence, our results show that the atrad <dig>  gene and its upstream sequence are required and sufficient to rescue the atrad <dig>  mutant phenotype  . molecular characterisation of a comp line exposed to ionising radiation also suggests a correlation between the re-established col-like resistance to ionising radiation and the high amounts of atrad <dig> -gfp-6xhis transcript detected ; .figure  <dig> 
the genomic construct, comprising the putative
atrad <dig> 
promoter region and gene, complements the
atrad <dig> 
mutation. the complementation lines  are not hypersensitive to dna dsb damage inducing ionising radiation, unlike the atrad <dig>  mutant. plants were photographed 27 days after exposure of the imbibed seeds to ionising radiation . two independent complementation lines   and the atrad <dig>  mutant  are shown.



the complementation lines also demonstrate that the atrad <dig>  mutant retains the ability to be transformed and integrate t-dna into its genome and that the epitope-tag  fused to the predicted c-terminal end of the atrad <dig>  protein does not affect the function of the atrad <dig>  protein in γ-ray irradiated imbibed seeds . unfortunately, we were not able to detect gfp signal using fluorescence microscopy, either in non-irradiated or in γ-ray irradiated complementation lines , possibly due to conformational changes of the gfp tag in the context of the recombinant protein.

atrad <dig>  expression: an emergency-like response to dna dsb damage induction
it has been shown that the transcription of atrad <dig>  is responsive to the induction of dna dsb damage   <cit> , and that the atrad <dig>  mutant imbibed seeds are hypersensitive to dna dsb damage  <cit> . this suggests that the atrad <dig>  transcript content increase, induced by dna dsb, may be required for dna dsb damage repair.

it has been reported that, 1 hour after the exposure to 100 gy of ionising radiation, no significant change in atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  gene transcription is detectable in a northern blot  <cit> . yet, it is not known whether transcription also remains unchanged when higher doses of ionising radiation are applied and more dna damage is induced. the atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  gene transcription dynamics at different time points after the induction of dna dsb damage are also unknown. hence, due to the importance of the rad <dig> cohesin in dna repair, and due to the lack of a more detailed characterisation of arabidopsis atrad <dig> gene expression responsiveness to dna dsb, we monitored the dynamics of atrad <dig> , atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  transcript content at different time points, during the first 48 hours after exposure to ionising radiation . the atrad <dig> genes’ transcript content variation was monitored in rosette leaves from four weeks old col plant, using quantitative real-time pcr , after exposure to 316 gy of ionising radiation .

as early as 5 minutes aei, we observed a 50-fold increase of atrad <dig>  transcript content in irradiated versus control  samples  and s2; additional file 1: table s2). the amount of transcript peaked circa  <dig> to 2 hours aei, being almost 100-fold higher than in non-irradiated samples . at 4 hours aei, the steady state levels of atrad <dig>  transcript progressively decrease, approaching non-irradiated levels after 48 hour aei . the presented data was obtained from three independent replicates, and using two different primer pairs  targeting two different regions of the atrad <dig>  transcript .figure  <dig> 
atrad <dig> 
has an emergency-like transcription response to dna dsb damage. steady-state atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig> transcript levels increase abruptly immediately after the end of irradiation exposure  in four weeks old col rosette leaves irradiated with 316 gy ; non-irradiated samples were used as reference . the atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig> steady-state transcript level peak is detected  <dig> to 2 hours  ; peaks of circa 100-fold and 317-fold increase in atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  respectively. atrad <dig>  steady-state transcript levels revert to normal expression levels after 48 hours  aei. atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  transcript levels variation is mild, in comparison to atrad <dig> , even if atrad <dig>  transcript steady-state levels increase by two-fold in response to dna dsb. values are the mean of three biological replicates for each time point. the relative transcript content was calculated using actin <dig> and atef1αa <dig> as the reference genes, and normalized against the non-irradiated sample. the error bars represent the standard deviation. quantitative rt-pcr data is available in additional file 1: table s <dig> 



atrad <dig>  a gene involved in hr  <cit> , and atrad <dig>  have very similar patterns of transcript steady-state content variation. this variation is, however, much more pronounced in atrad <dig> than in atrad <dig> . atrad <dig> reaches a peak of 317-fold increase in transcript steady-state levels, 2 hours aei  and s2; additional file 1: table s2).

reports on atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  gene expression after dna dsb induction are limited to certain time points , and suggest that the expression of these genes is not responsive to the induction of dna dsb. our results show that atrad <dig>  transcript content is diminished during most of the period of 48 hours after the induction of dna dsb ; the atatm mrna content variation after the induction of dna dsb is more difficult to interpret since a decrease as well as an increase in transcription content is detected ). in contrast, the qrt-pcr data shows that the steady-state atrad <dig>  transcript levels double after the exposure to 316 gy of ionising radiation. atrad <dig>  expression, which is not as responsive as atrad <dig>  is to dna dsb induction, reaches its peak between  <dig> and 8 hours aei in contrast with atrad <dig>  transcript levels that reach their peak circa  <dig> to 2 hours aei ). these observations suggest that these two cohesin genes may be required for different roles in the cell since the dynamics of their rna content variation, after the induction of dna dsb damage, is not identical.

atrad <dig> , in association with atrad <dig> , confers resistance to ionising radiation-induced damage
because qrt-pcr data shows that the induction of dna dsb induces the doubling of the atrad <dig>  steady-state transcript content, we investigated further if atrad <dig>  does play a role in dna dsb repair. unlike atrad <dig> , the atrad <dig>  single mutant does not exhibit clearly discernible dna dsb damage hypersensitivity phenotypes   <cit> . hence, we used the atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  double mutant to more easily identify and characterise the role played by atrad <dig>  in dna dsb. the rational is that any atrad <dig>  induced dna dsb damage phenotype  will be more easily detected in the double mutant. the atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  double mutant plants are viable and fully fertile, producing a full seed set in each silique .

30 days after irradiating  imbibed seeds with 150 gy , atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  seedlings exhibit a more acute hypersensitivity to γ-irradiation than the atrad <dig>  seedlings . the atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  γ-ray hypersensitivity phenotype, in comparison to the atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  single mutants’, is characterised by a higher incidence of seedlings that bear only two expanded cotyledons and no true leaves . this is particularly evident at 100 gy  ; additional file 1: table s <dig> and figure s3), although a few seedlings do develop more true leaves. the higher incidence of seedlings with no true leaves in the atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  double mutant, in comparison to the atrad <dig> single mutants and col, is clearly reflected in the value of the medians ), modes and means . furthermore, according to the mann–whitney u-test analysis of the number of true leaves data ), the atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  double mutant is significantly different  = <dig>  2-tailed hypothesis) from col ). comparatively to the double mutant γ-ray hypersensitive, atrad <dig>  mutant seedlings bear more true leaves. still, atrad <dig>  is developmentally delayed in comparison to wild-type as far as the number of true leaves and the size of the leaves is concerned . at 100 gy, atrad <dig>  is already significantly different from col, albeit with a higher p value  than the double mutant . in contrast, atrad <dig>  is not significantly different from col at 100 gy . only at 150 gy is it possible to detect a significant difference between atrad <dig>  and col ; additional file 1: figure s4). ultimately, many, if not all, of the seedlings exhibiting hypersensitivity to ionising radiation  will senesce.figure  <dig> 
the
atrad <dig>  atrad <dig> 
double mutant is more hypersensitive to dna dsb damage than
atrad <dig> 
. both the atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  double mutant and the atrad <dig>  single mutant are hypersensitive to exposure to ionising radiation , being the former more hypersensitive than the latter; as observed in different experimental replicas. in contrast, the atrad <dig>  single mutant reaches a development stage more similar to col, even after exposure to 150 gy of ionising radiation. the differences in development are highlighted in the blown up images  of seedlings after exposure to 150 gy of ionising radiation. these illustrate the predominant double mutant seedlings’ phenotype; development arrest and senesce at an early developmental stage, namely in seedlings with none or one true leaf. these blown up images also show that atrad <dig>  seedlings experience severe development delay, yet not as severe as in the double mutant . in both the single and double mutants, some plants manage to develop further, forming more true leaves. all seedlings were germinated from irradiated imbibed seeds exposed to 150 gy of γ-rays  and photographed 30 days after. 0 gy - not exposed to ionising radiation. col - wild-type columbia- <dig> plants.
dna dsb severely affects development in the
atrad <dig>  atrad <dig> 
double mutant. 
atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  displays the severest dna dsb damage induced developmental arrest. the highest frequency of seedlings arrested at the early stages of development  in the atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  double mutant illustrates its high hypersensitivity to dna dsb damage. at  <dig> gy, this frequency is higher in the double mutant than in the single mutants and col; only at  <dig> gy does this frequency, in atrad <dig>  and the double mutant, become similar. at  <dig> gy, the frequency of seedlings with  <dig> and  <dig> true leaf, in col and in atrad <dig> , is similar; but at  <dig> gy it becomes higher in atrad <dig> . 
atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  are significantly different from col . medians and the mann-whitney non-parametric test < <dig> , 2-tailed hypothesis) show that dna dsb induces severe development arrest in atrad <dig>  atrad <dig> , and less so in atrad <dig> . both mutants are significantly different from col . only at  <dig> gy is atrad <dig>  also significantly different from col. error bars: standard deviation of the data . black asterisk: significant difference , . grey asterisk: significant difference  at  <dig> gy: ; and at  <dig> gy: , , . atrad <dig>  is not significantly different from col at  <dig> gy . figure 4

the kinetics of dna dsb damage repair is affected, and higher basal levels of dna dsb are detected, in the atrad <dig>  mutant
to further characterise the role of atrad <dig> cohesins, we monitored repair of dna dsb by comet assays in 10-days-old seedlings exposed to bleomycin. we chose to use bleomycin, a radiomimetic cancerostatic agent that induces dna dsb in a similar manner to ionising radiation  <cit> , because it allowed us to compare our results with previously published data of dna dsb repair kinetics  <cit> . three different atrad <dig> homozygous mutants were used in the comet assay . the atrad <dig>  mutant was excluded from this and other assays because, to the best of our knowledge, there are no viable atrad <dig>  homozygous mutant knockout lines available  <cit> .

repair kinetics observed in seedlings of wild-type col, atrad <dig> , atrad <dig>  and the atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  double mutant control  and exposed to 10 μg/ml bleomycin are not significantly different . however, when higher bleomycin concentrations  are used, which result in the induction of more dna dsb  <cit> , impaired dna dsb repair becomes perceptible in the single mutants relative to wild-type. significant differences are particularly evident between  <dig> to 60 minutes after dna dsb induction ), i.e. in the transition period from the initial fast phase of dsb repair kinetics to the following slow phase of dsb repair kinetics  <cit>  . unlike the single mutants, atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  has wild-type-like  dna dsb damage repair kinetics when exposed to 30 μg/ml bleomycin. yet, the double mutant as well as the atrad <dig>  and the atrad <dig>  single mutants exhibit a significantly higher content of nuclear dna dsb  then the wild-type ), even when there is no induction of dna dsb.figure  <dig> 
dna dsb basal levels and repair kinetics are altered in the atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  mutants. 
atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  single mutants’ dna dsb damage repair kinetics is similar. during the first 60 minutes after dna dsb damage induction, atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  mutants retain more unrepaired dna dsb than col. this difference is more striking at 10 minutes , 20 minutes  and 60 minutes  after dna dsb damage induction. the atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  double mutant has a col-like dna dsb damage repair kinetics. dna dsb damage quantification was carried out on nuclei from 10-days old seedlings harvested  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 180 minutes after exposure to 30 μg/ml bleomycin. col - wild-type columbia- <dig> plant. 
atrad <dig> , atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  mutants have higher basal levels of dna dsb than col. the amount of dna dsb detected, by comet assay, in nuclei obtained from seedlings not exposed to dna dsb inducing agent, indicates that the amount of dna dsb detected in col is significantly lower than the amount detected in atrad <dig> , atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  mutants. dna dsb damage quantification was carried out on nuclei from 10-days old seedlings that were not exposed to bleomycin. error bars represent the standard error. col - wild-type columbia- <dig> plant. comet assay data is available in additional file 1: table s <dig> 



the atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  double mutant hypersensitivity to dna dsb damage is less acute than in the atku <dig> atrad <dig>  double mutant and the atku <dig> single mutant
dna dsb are repaired via different dna repair pathways. rad <dig> has been proposed to facilitate dna dsb repair via hr by keeping the homologous dna sequences of sister chromatids in close proximity  <cit> . however, in plants, dna dsb are predominantly repaired via direct joining of double stand breaks’ ends , which do not require an extended homologous dna sequence strand for repair  <cit> . to determine the consequences of disrupting atrad <dig>  in a c-nhej dna repair pathway mutant, we’ve introgressed the atrad <dig>  mutant allele into the atku <dig> mutant background  <cit>  to produce the atrad <dig>  atku <dig> double mutant.

the atku <dig> atrad <dig>  double mutant plants were genotyped  and shown to be viable. under normal growth conditions , these plants have a normal vegetative and fertility phenotype; seed set in each silique of the double mutant is indistinguishable from that of col plants . when the imbibed seeds of atku <dig> atrad <dig>  double mutant, and the atku <dig> mutant, are exposed to γ-rays , both mutants exhibit a similar acute hypersensitivity phenotype . no hypersensitivity to dna dsb is detected when imbibed col, atku <dig> and atku <dig> atrad <dig>  mutant seeds are irradiated with 50 gy  of ionising radiation .figure  <dig>

dna dsb damage hypersensitivity. comparison of the dna dsb damage induced phenotypes of the c-nhej associated atku <dig> mutant versus the hr associated rad <dig> mutations. imbibed seeds of mutants homozygous for the atku <dig> mutant allele  are extremely hypersensitive to dna dsb; furthermore, they are more hypersensitive to dna dsb than the atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  double mutant and even more so than the atrad <dig>  single mutant; this has been confirmed in different experimental replicas. the blown up  seedlings’ pictures show atku <dig> and atku <dig> atrad <dig>  exhibiting a more severe hypersensitivity to dna dsb damage than atrad <dig>  atrad <dig> . while some atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  seedlings are still able to form some true leaves  after irradiation with 100 gy of ionising radiation, atku <dig> and atku <dig> atrad <dig>  development is arrested at an earlier stage . the atrad <dig>  seedlings exhibit the least hypersensitive phenotype of all four mutants. imbibed seeds were exposed to 100 gy of ionising radiation ; 0 gy were not exposed to ionising radiation. the seedlings germinated from the irradiated imbibed seeds were photographed 23 days after the exposure to ionising radiation. col - wild-type columbia- <dig> plant; ws - wild type wassilewskija- <dig> plant.



comparison of hypersensitivities to dna dsb induced by ionising radiation shows that atku <dig> and atku <dig> atrad <dig>  mutants are clearly more hypersensitive to dna dsb than the atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  double mutant, and even more so then the atrad <dig>  single mutant .

these observations indicate that even though the atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  cohesins play an important role in dna dsb repair in imbibed seeds, the atku <dig> protein, that is associated with c-nhej, plays a predominant role in dna dsb repair. this is in agreement with previous reports that show that the c-nhej repair pathway is the predominant repair pathway in plants  <cit> . due to the severity of the atku <dig> and atku <dig> atrad <dig>  mutant phenotypes it is not possible to determine if the dna damage hypersensitivity phenotype observed in the atku <dig> atrad <dig>  double mutant is identical to that of the atku <dig>  or if it is cumulative, yet masked by the severity of the atku <dig> phenotype.

discussion
atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  arabidopsis thaliana cohesins’ emergency response to dna dsb damage
the increase of steady-state atrad <dig>  rna levels, and more dramatically, the rapid and immediate increase of steady-state atrad <dig>  rna levels after the induction of dna dsb suggests that both cohesins play a role in an emergency response to dna dsb damage . transcription upregulation of the atrad <dig> -gfp-6xhis transgene in the complementation line plants upon exposure to ionising radiation  and the rescue of the atrad <dig>  dna dsb damage hypersensitivity phenotype in these same lines  links the atrad <dig>  emergency response to dna dsb repair. this data suggests that the upregulation of atrad <dig>  transcriptional activity could be directly correlated with an increase in cohesion induced by dna dsb . this hypothesis is in accordance with the reported observation that dna damage induces in col an increase in sister chromatid cohesion just 10 minutes after exposure to irradiation  <cit> . moreover, and also 10 minutes after the induction of dna dsb damage, the atrad <dig>  mutant experiences a striking delay in dna dsb repair ). together, these observations suggest that, as observed with rad <dig> homologues in other organisms, atrad <dig>  could also be involved in dna dsb induced de novo cohesion required for dna dsb repair in arabidopsis. indeed, in yeast and human cells, it has been proposed that the recruitment of rad <dig> cohesin to chromosomes after dna dsb induction  <cit>  reinforces the tethering of sister chromatids by quickly establishing dna dsb induced de novo cohesion. further experiments will be required to demonstrate if this atrad <dig>  emergency response indeed leads to the de novo cohesion and the increased sister chromatid cohesion. the upregulation of atrad <dig>  transcription  and the concurrent slower dna dsb repair detected 10 minutes after the induction of dna dsb  suggest that atrad <dig>  may also be involved in an atrad <dig> -like dna dsb repair emergency response.

finally, the similar timing of atrad <dig> and atrad <dig>  transcript content increase  suggests that atrad <dig>  might also be required during the first stages of dna dsb repair. atrad <dig>  similarly to its homologues in yeast, is thought to be involved in dna strand invasion and homology search during the first stages of recombination  <cit> . hence, atrad <dig>  may play a role at the early stages of somatic recombination  too.

both atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  are required for dna dsb repair
atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  are required for dna dsb repair when numerous dna dsb are induced  ), as well as when plants are not exposed to dna dsb inducing agents ).

atrad <dig> , atrad <dig>  single mutants, and the atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  double mutant, exhibit similar and significantly higher basal level of dna dsb when compared to col ). this indicates that atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  are probably required for the repair  of dna dsb induced by endogenous stresses  or naturally occurring environmental stresses.

dna repair kinetics data from atrad <dig>   <cit> , atrad <dig>  ), and other arabidopsis mutants affecting hr in somatic tissue and with no apparent deleterious defects during meiosis, such as atrad <dig>  <cit>  and gmi <dig>   <cit> , shows that these mutants experience a delay in dna dsb repair when many dna dsb are induced. this delay is evident, as early as  <dig> to 20 minutes after bleomycin treatment, in the atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  mutant seedlings ), as well as in the gmi <dig> mutants  <cit> . these similarities suggest that like gmi <dig>  atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  may also be involved in hr. the decrease in dna dsb repair kinetics observed in the atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  single mutants has also been observed in yeast strains that contain low amounts of rad <dig> protein  <cit> . this suggests a correlation between the amount of induced dna dsb in the cell, and the amount of rad <dig> protein required for the dna dsb repair. indeed, when low bleomycin concentration  is used, inducing few dna dsb, the observed repair kinetics between col, the atrad <dig> , atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  is not significantly different . one possible explanation for the similarity in repair kinetics being that the level of chromosome cohesion remaining in the mutant lines is sufficient to countervail the small amount of dna dsb produced, and hence the efficiency of dna dsb repair is not affected. yet, when more dna dsb are produced   <cit> , the lack of atrad <dig>  or atrad <dig>  in the single mutants becomes critical for dna repair.

we hypothesise that an increasing number of dna dsb in the cell leads to an increasing need of an abundant pool of cohesin proteins to establish de novo cohesion, to allow dna dsb hr repair. hence, a less abundant pool of cohesins in the atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  single mutants would account for the less efficient dna repair  observed during the first  <dig> to 20 minutes after the induction of a high incidence of dna dsb ). the slower dna repair kinetics observed in the atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  single mutants could also be caused by an atrad21-dependent dna-damage-repair-checkpoint. indeed, the yeast rad <dig> mutation has been correlated with the disruption of dna-damage-induced-checkpoints. likewise, in mammalian cells, rad <dig> is involved in dna-damage-induced cell cycle progression arrest during dna replication and at the g2/m cell cycle stages  <cit> .

in the particular case of the atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  double mutant, which has a wild-type-like repair kinetic ), it is plausible that due to the knockout of both atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  genes , an atrad21-dependent dna dsb repair pathway becomes fully compromised. consequently, we propose that in the double mutant, the dna dsb repair is switched to an atrad21-non-dependent dna dsb repair pathway with a kinetics similar to the one observed in the atku <dig> mutant  <cit>  and wild-type. atku <dig> is associated with nhej dna repair, unlike rad <dig> , atrad <dig> and gmi that are associated with hr  <cit> .

further experiments will help validate these or other hypothesis.

acute hypersensitivity to dna dsb in the atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  double mutant
despite the lack of atrad <dig>  protein, which has been attributed a role in sister chromatid arm cohesion and centromere cohesion  <cit> , the atrad <dig>  single mutant morphology appears not to differ from that of col, after exposure to ionising radiation . only a more detailed characterisation  of the atrad <dig>  mutant indicates that only after exposure to high doses of radiation ; 150 gy) does the difference between atrad <dig>  and col becomes significant. furthermore, the lack of atrad <dig>  cohesin in the atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  mutant background results in a higher dna dsb hypersensitivity phenotype, comparatively to the atrad <dig>  single mutant’s and col’s dna dsb hypersensitivity phenotype . these results indicate that both atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  contribute to the plant’s ability to cope with dna dsb damage, with atrad <dig>  having a synergistic and non-redundant effect on the atrad <dig>  function. other examples exist of synergistic actions on dna dsb damage repair and genome stability, namely atrad <dig> and tert, nbs <dig> and tert, nbs <dig> and atm  <cit> .

a shift from an atrad21-dependent, possibly error free hr repair, to an error-prone-atrad21-independent dna dsb repair pathway could be at the origin of the increased hypersensitivity of the atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  double mutant to dna dsb damage. this shift would give rise to an increased frequency of deleterious mutations resulting from the dna dsb repair, hence inducing the enhanced hypersensitivity to dna dsb observed in the double mutant . increased frequency of genomic lesions has been observed in the moss physcomitrella patens ppmre <dig> and pprad <dig> mutants  <cit> . these authors propose that this increased frequency of lesions is caused by a shift to an error-prone dna repair pathway that directly joins the dna dsb ends after processing them, and also by the disruption of the rad <dig> and mre <dig> role in tethering the two dna dsb ends in close proximity.

even though atrad <dig>  atrad <dig> , atku <dig> and wild-type have comparable dna dsb repair kinetics, the double mutant is not as hypersensitive to dna dsb as the atku <dig> mutant  <cit>  . one can speculate that this difference is caused by the choice of different dna dsb repair pathways in the imbibed seeds of the atku <dig> and atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  mutants.

proposed role of atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  in sister chromatid cohesion and dna repair
in this work we show that both atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  are involved in dna dsb repair. in figure  <dig> is illustrated an hypothesis that proposes that upon induction of dna dsb, the atrad <dig>  emergency transcriptional response ensures an enriched pool of atrad <dig>  that will reinforce sister chromatid cohesion after the induction of dna dsb. this function appears to be required at the early stages of dna dsb repair , and is crucial since the atrad <dig>  is hypersensitive to dna dsb damage. atrad <dig>  upregulation is also proposed to contribute, but at a later stage, to the pool of atrad <dig> cohesin proteins required for dna dsb repair after the induction of dna dsb. however, the atrad <dig>  primarily role may be to establish chromosome cohesion and contribute to chromosome structure regardless of the presence or the absence of dna dsb. indeed, data from takahashi and quimbaya et al.  <cit>  hint that atrad <dig>  cohesion may be associated with dna replication. hence, the major atrad <dig>  contribution to the repair of dna dsb may be to provide a pre-existing chromosome scaffold and cohesion that will aid the repair of dna dsb that arise subsequently.figure  <dig> 
proposed model: atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  before and after induction of dna dsb damage.  before the induction of dna dsb, sister chromatid cohesion is promoted by atrad <dig>  , and possibly also by some atrad <dig>   associated with dna dsb created by endogenous factors.  after the induction of dna dsb breaks , atrad <dig>  expression is enhanced. this is expected to increase the pool of cohesin complexes containing atrad <dig>   in the cell, hence contributing to promote and enhance sister chromatid cohesion.  the dna dsb damage induced increase of atrad <dig>  transcript content , is also expected to contribute to increase the pool cohesin complexes containing atrad <dig>  . these cohesin complexes  may reinforce sister chromatid cohesion, or they may replace  the atrad <dig>  cohesin complexes  that generated the de novo cohesion. it has been proposed that the increased cohesion facilitates dna dsb repair by promoting physical proximity between the chromatid with a dna dsb  and its intact sister chromatid . green and red rings: cohesin complexes tethering the two sister chromatids . yellow lines: the site of the dna dsb. flash : the dna dsb inducing agent.



the conjecture that atrad <dig>  plays a role in chromosome structure is based on evidences that the rad <dig> protein, in metazoans, is involved in chromatin structure  <cit>  and associates with the nuclear matrix  <cit> . interestingly, like for the atrad <dig>  mutant  <cit>  , it has also been reported that the mis-expression or the knocking-out of some matrix-associated proteins that contribute to chromatin remodelling, also affects flower-bolting time  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the identification of atrad <dig> ’s involvement in dna dsb damage repair adds another player to the group of known proteins that are involved in dna dsb repair in arabidopsis. a role for atrad <dig>  in dna dsb damage repair is clearly demonstrated by the comet assay data and the γ-ray hypersensitivity phenotype observed in the atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  double mutant. likewise, the reduced number of true leaves in the atrad <dig>  single mutant, in comparison to col, particularly after exposure to high dosages of radiation , is also an indication that atrad <dig>  plays a role in dna dsb damage repair. furthermore, the different γ-ray hypersensitivity phenotypes exhibited by the atrad <dig> , atrad <dig>  and atrad <dig>  atrad <dig>  mutants, and the fact that both genes are upregulated in response to dna dsb damage indicates that their functions in dna dsb damage repair are not redundant. our data reveals an increased level of complexity to the involvement of cohesins in dna dsb damage repair that could be specific to plants.
