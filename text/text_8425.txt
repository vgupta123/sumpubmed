BACKGROUND
the accumulation of γ-aminobutyrate  in plants subjected to abiotic stress is often attributed to the ca2+/calmodulin - or ph-mediated stimulation of glutamate decarboxylation, although polyamines may also contribute  <cit> . plant glutamate decarboxylase  requires pyridoxal 5′-phosphate  as a co-factor, is specific for l-glutamate and maximally active at approximately ph  <dig> , and exists as dimeric or hexameric complexes  <cit> . gad activity in cell-free extracts prepared in the presence of protease inhibitors and partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography is typically assayed as the production of 14co <dig> from radiolabeled glutamate or gaba from unlabeled glutamate with or without the addition of cam antagonists such as trifluoperazine . the activation of gad activity by ca2+/cam is more dramatic at neutral ph than optimum ph.

the c-terminal cam-binding domain  of gad is highly variable and evidence exists for a c-terminal domain in rice gad  that does not bind cam, but is autoinhibitory  <cit> . the extent of the ca2+/cam stimulation of activity can also vary widely among various recombinant gads   <cit> . possible explanations for this variability could be the final purity of the protein being tested, as well as the method used for purification. there is also evidence to suggest that a tag may influence yield, conformation and biological activity of the recombinant protein  <cit> ; however, the time required to remove the motif may be detrimental to the activity of an unstable protein.

the accumulation of gaba in apple fruit stored under controlled atmosphere conditions was recently reported  <cit> , and now there is increasing interest in the biochemical mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon  <cit> . here, we report the identification of three gads in apple fruit and demonstrate, via the use of suitable tagging/purification strategies, that two are cam-dependent and one is cam-independent.

RESULTS
gad activity in cell-free extracts from apple fruit
gad activity in cell-free apple extracts at ph  <dig>  in the absence or presence of ca2+/cam was similar with bisamino-trismethane  and pyridine-hcl buffers . thus, we used these two buffers to study gad activity at several phs between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the ph optimum was approximately  <dig>  to  <dig> , and at these phs ca2+/cam stimulated activity by about 70% and tfp inhibited activity by 35-60% in the presence of ca2+/cam. at ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig>  the stimulation by ca2+/cam  and the inhibition by tfp increased markedly. tfp did not affect activity in the absence of added ca2+/cam.

alignment of three putative apple gads with previously characterized plant gads
mdgad <dig> , mdgad <dig>  and mdgad <dig> , respectively, encode proteins of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  amino acids, which are 64-75% identical to each other and 60-85% identical to several plant gads that have been characterized experimentally . the region of greatest variability in the sequences of these proteins is in the c-terminus, the location of the cambd  <cit> . the c-terminal segments of the three apple gads are 3-27% identical to each other and 4-46% identical to those in gads of the other plant species, although this region of mdgad <dig> has only 3-6% identity. closer examination and manual editing of the sequence alignment indicates that two conserved positively charged clusters of lysines flanking the cambd and a conserved tryptophan residue are involved in cam binding  <cit>  . notably, osgad <dig> is missing the first lysine cluster and the tryptophan and does not bind cam  <cit> . in general, both mdgad <dig> and mdgad <dig> contain most of the conserved features, but mdgad <dig> contains none of these features.

expression of three putative apple gad genes in various plant organs
transcripts for the three gad genes were detectable in the fruit, leaf and inflorescence, but mdgad <dig> was the most prominent, followed distantly by mdgad <dig> and mdgad <dig> . the relative proportions of mdgad <dig> and mdgad <dig>  compared to mdgad <dig>  were highest in the fruit and lowest in the inflorescence.

impact of ph and ca2+/cam on the activity of various recombinant apple and arabidopsis gads
we investigated the impact of ca2+/cam on the performance  of recombinant full-length mdgad1- <dig> and truncated mdgad3Δc <dig>  apple gad activity was compared to the performance of the full-length atgad <dig> and in most cases a truncated version of the atgad <dig> lacking the c-terminal cambd , ensuring that the purification and assay of the enzymes were effective. because atgad1Δc <dig>  mdgad <dig> and mdgadΔc <dig> could not be purified by cam-affinity chromatography, a 6-his motif was added , prompting us to also investigate the impact of the tag on gad activity. assays of gad activity and determination of spectral properties were simultaneously conducted as soon as possible after the recombinant protein was extracted to minimize proteolysis that seemed to occur even in the presence of several popular protease inhibitors.

initially, the n-terminal his-tagged versions of mdgad <dig>  mdgad3Δc <dig>  atgad <dig>  and atgad1Δc <dig> were compared. after purification via ni2+- affinity chromatography, these recombinant proteins were thrombin-digested to remove the his-tag and concentrated for determining activity and spectral properties. each of these preparations had a prominent band on a sds-page gel at the predicted molecular mass; only the preparation of hatgad <dig> appeared to contain a second prominent band, which was of a slightly lower molecular mass than the other and possibly a degradation product resulting from the sensitivity of the cambd to proteolytic activity . the highest activities of the various gads were evident at ph  <dig>  and varied less than 1-fold , and there was no stimulation of these activities by added ca2+/cam . activities declined with increasing ph and for hatgad <dig> this was accompanied by 2- and 4-fold stimulations by ca2+/cam of activity at phs  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. however, there was no stimulation of hatgad1Δc <dig>  hmdgad <dig> and hmdgad3Δc <dig> activities by ca2+/cam at these phs. since both hatgad <dig> and hatgad1Δc <dig> responded to ca2+/cam as predicted, these data support the notion that ca2+/cam could not bind to either hmdgad <dig> or hmdgad3Δc <dig> 

in a follow-up experiment, hmdgad <dig> was compared to hatgad <dig>  hatgad1Δc <dig> and atgad <dig>  with the first three recombinant proteins being purified by ni2+-affinity chromatography and the fourth by cam-affinity chromatography. steps involving thrombin digestion and concentration were omitted. as above, preparations of purified hatgad <dig>  as well as atgad <dig>  had one main band at the predicted molecular mass on a sds-page gel, as well as a slightly smaller prominent band; the other gads showed only one main band . activities reached  <dig> μmol mg prot-1 min- <dig> at ph  <dig>  decreased with increasing ph, and appeared to be more variable than in the initial experiment . ca2+/cam stimulated the activities of atgad <dig> and hatgad <dig> at ph  <dig>  by 9- and 5-fold, respectively, but had no impact on the activities of hatgadΔc <dig> and hmdgad <dig>  therefore, the response of hatgad <dig>  hatgadΔc <dig> and hmdgad <dig> to ca2+/cam was similar to that in the initial experiment. notably, the impact of ca2+/cam was slightly greater with the atgad <dig>  suggesting that the presence of the his tag influences the conformation of the protein. overall, these results confirm that the c-terminus of atgad <dig> is autoinhibitory at neutral ph and that this autoinhibition can be relieved when bound to ca2+/cam. they also indicate that the c-terminus of mdgad <dig> is not autoinhibitory and that it does not bind ca2+/cam.

subsequently, mdgad <dig> and mdgad <dig> were compared to atgad <dig>  all three recombinant proteins were purified by cam-affinity chromatography and steps involving thrombin digestion and concentration were omitted . purified atgad <dig> had one prominent and one minor band, mdgad <dig> had one major band, and mdgad <dig> had two bands of equal prominence . the higher molecular mass bands were equivalent to the predicted subunit molecular masses for the three proteins. the activity of atgad <dig> at ph  <dig> was similar to that in the previous experiment, but in this case the stimulation by ca2+/cam at ph  <dig>  was 150-fold because the activity in the absence of ca2+/cam was very low . the activities of mdgad <dig> and mdgad <dig> at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, were stimulated by approximately 1- and 9-fold, and 3- and 1-fold. these results indicate that mdgad <dig> and mdgad <dig>  like atgad <dig>  have an autoinhibitory domain, but the ph optimum for mdgad <dig> and mdgad <dig> may differ somewhat from each other.

impact of ph and ca2+/cam on the spectral properties of various recombinant apple and arabidopsis gads
recently, gut et al.  <cit>  attributed absorption bands for atgad <dig> at 338 nm and 415 nm, respectively, to the enolimine and ketoenamine tautomers of the schiff base of plp and enzyme  . here, the absorption bands were compared among atgad <dig>  hatgad1Δc <dig>  mdgad <dig>  mdgad <dig> and hmdgad <dig> . as found previously for atgad <dig>  <cit> , both bands were evident over the ph range of  <dig>  to  <dig> , the 415 nm band prevailed at low ph where the enzyme is most active and the 338 nm band prevailed at neutral and basic phs, the absorption values at 338 nm or 415 nm displayed a sigmoidal curve with ph, and ca2+/cam essentially abolished the ph-dependence . also, the absorption bands for a truncated version of the protein lacking the cambd displayed a ph-independent pattern and was characterized by the prevalence of the 415 nm band over the entire ph range, regardless of whether ca2+/cam was present or not ; these characteristics are similar to those observed with a version of atgad <dig> in which lys <dig> and lys  <dig> in the cambd are replaced by alanine residues  <cit>  . here, the prevalence of the bands was similar in both mdgad <dig> and mdgad <dig> at low ph, but the 415 nm band decreased with increasing ph and the 338 nm band increased, although the change in levels was not as dramatic as with atgad <dig> and the sigmoidal relationship between absorbance and ph was less evident . nevertheless, ca2+/cam essentially abolished the ph dependence . for hmdgad <dig>  the levels of the bands were similar, although they increased slightly over the ph range; ca2+/cam had no effect on this pattern . together, these data indicate that ph and ca2+/cam influence the spectral properties of mdgad <dig> and mdgad <dig> in a manner similar to that observed for atgad <dig>  although the magnitude of the response is less dramatic, and that hmdgad <dig>  like hatgad1Δc <dig>  is essentially unaffected by ph and ca2+/cam.

discussion
gad activity in cell-free extracts of apple fruit was regulated by both ph and ca2+/cam
gad enzymes are ubiquitous across all kingdoms, and in plants both transcript accumulation and activity may be induced during development and in response to abiotic and biotic stress perturbations  <cit> . in plants subjected to temperature stress, drought, salinity or mechanical handling, there is an increase in intracellular ca2+ concentration  <cit> , which would promote stimulation of gad by ca2+/cam, whereas exposure to elevated co <dig>  o <dig> deficiency and wounding would influence gad activity by cytosolic acidification in numerous plant tissues and species  <cit> . as gaba has been shown to accumulate in apple fruit during controlled atmosphere storage, and this level is higher during prolonged treatment with elevated co <dig> <cit> , we hypothesized that apple fruit gad activity is stimulated by cytosolic acidification and/or ca2+/cam. gad activity of cell-free extracts of apple fruit displayed optimal activity at ph  <dig>  in the presence of plp and saturating glutamate ; the final specific activity is comparable to in vitro activities of vegetative tissues of petunia, soybean, arabidopsis and maritime pine seedlings  <cit> . apple fruit gad activity was more dramatically stimulated by ca2+/cam at near physiological ph than at acidic ph , indicating that it may be regulated in planta by both ca2+/cam and ph. as there was no effect of the cam anatagonist, tfp, on in vitro gad activity, it is suggested that gad was not bound with endogenous cam and the binding of ca2+/cam to gad is tightly controlled by specific controlled atmosphere stress parameters. overall, the biochemical properties of gad activity in cell-free extracts of apple fruit provide support for the existence of a ca2+/cam-regulated gad, as is typical of most plants  <cit> . notably, three homologous gad genes , designated as mdgad <dig>  mdgad <dig> and mdgad <dig>  were present in the apple plant . mdgad <dig>  like atgad <dig>  was abundant and ubiquitous, whereas mdgad <dig> and mdgad <dig>  like atgad <dig> and atgad <dig>  were expressed at much lower levels and might be candidates for induction in fruit by the stresses  imposed during controlled atmosphere storage   <cit> .

recombinant gads from apple fruit were both cam-dependent and cam-independent
with our tagging/purification strategies, we were able to confirm that recombinant atgad <dig> is activated at physiological ph by ca2+/cam whether or not the 6-his tag was retained during the assay of activity and spectral properties . however, the degree of activation appeared to be greatest with the recombinant form of the native protein, which could be attributed to the very low activity found in the absence of ca2+/cam. while this interpretation is complicated somewhat by the variable amount of a smaller contaminating protein, probably a degradation product, in the final protein preparation, these findings do suggest that interpretation of the impact of ca2+/cam on the conformation and biological activity of tagged recombinant plant gads should be done with caution  <cit> .

here, his-tagged or untagged versions of the three apple gads were expressed in escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity or near homogeneity . the predicted subunit mr of the three recombinant apple proteins  is similar to the majority of plant gads, which exist as hexamers of 43–62 kda subunits  <cit> . the recombinant apple gads displayed a similar ph profile as shown for gad activity in the cell-free extracts of apple fruit , as well as a similar ph optimum with the majority of plant gads, and activities with ca2+/cam at physiological ph that are as high or higher than their maximal activities in the literature  <cit> . unlike most plant gads, mdgad <dig> was not activated by ca2+/cam at near physiological phs, even though the technique/assay used in this study was clearly able to demonstrate such a relationship . historically, the binding of cam to the conserved c-terminal domain has been considered necessary to relieve autoinhibition of gad at physiological ph  <cit> . however, osgad <dig>  was found to be cam-independent and possess a c-terminal region that is autoinhibitory  <cit> . mdgad <dig> is only the second reported plant gad that cannot be purified by cam-affinity chromatography and whose activity and spectral properties are not affected by ca2+/cam. notably, mdgad <dig> is the first plant gad that possesses a c-terminal region that is not autoinhibitory .

alignment of the c-terminal region of mdgad <dig> and mdgad <dig> with biochemically characterized plant gads demonstrated that key cambd residues are conserved in the apple enzymes, and that these are absent in osgad <dig> . the well-conserved tryptophan and a pair of lysine residues at the c-terminal end are crucial for interactions with cam and the formation of high molecular weight oligomers in phgad and atgad <dig>  <cit> . in comparison to plant gads known to be stimulated by ca2+/cam, mdgad <dig> is missing two positively charged flanking regions  and the trp488-lys489-lys490-phe491-tyr <dig> motif . their substitution by non-conserved residues may explain the lack of ca2+/cam stimulation of the recombinant mdgad <dig>  interestingly, almost all cam-binding residues in plant gads are conserved in mdgad <dig> and mdgad2; the main exceptions in which charge is not conserved are substitutions at lys <dig> and lys  <dig> in mdgad <dig> and lys <dig> in mdgad <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
plant gads typically differ from microbial and animal gad enzymes in possessing a c-terminal 30– <dig> amino acid residue cambd  <cit> . to date, osgad <dig> is the only exception to this generalization; notably, the c-terminal region of this protein still functions as an autoinhibitory domain . in the present study, gad activity in cell-free extracts of apple fruit could be stimulated by ca2+/cam at physiological ph. based on bioinformatics analysis of the apple genome, we identified three apple gad genes and then monitored their expression in various plant organs, including apple fruit. like most plant gads, the activity and spectral properties of recombinant mdgad <dig> and mdgad <dig> were regulated by both ca2+/cam and acidic ph and possessed a highly conserved cambd. in contrast, the activity and spectral properties of recombinant mdgad <dig> were not affected by ca2+/cam and they were less sensitive to ph; furthermore, the c-terminal region neither bound cam nor functioned as an autoinhibitory domain. these observations suggest that:  mdgad <dig> is constitutively active, whereas osgad <dig> needs an activator other than ca2+/cam to be activated; and  cam–dependent and -independent mdgads enzymes serve different roles in gaba production during the onset of physiological injury associated with controlled atmosphere storage conditions .
