BACKGROUND
pleistocene glaciations and subsequent postglacial recolonisation events have profoundly affected biota within the northern hemisphere in terms of the distribution of genetic diversity and phylogeographical lineages  <cit> . evolution did not, however, cease after the last glaciation. thus, in several cases it has been difficult to disentangle population differentiation that can be ascribed to postglacial processes, i.e. within the past ca.  <dig>  years, versus longer term evolution pre-dating the last glaciation  <cit> .

this problem is particularly evident in freshwater fishes such as whitefish  and threespine stickleback , both of which show extensive phenotypic variability and comprise sympatrically and allopatrically divergent morphs  <cit> . polymorphisms involving both benthic and limnetic forms and differences in lateral plate number have been extensively studied in sticklebacks, and it has been found that similar morphs have evolved repeatedly and independently, primarily representing postglacial divergence  <cit> . in coregonus, "dwarf" vs. "normal" sized morphs and morphs with high vs. low gill raker number have attracted considerable interest, and the situation appears highly complex. in north america dwarf-normal forms and high-low gill raker forms in lake whitefish  have in some cases been found to represent different phylogeographical lineages and in other cases postglacial divergence  <cit> . moreover, for dwarf-normal systems parallel evolution has been suggested to involve the same loci  <cit> . in the closely related european lake whitefish , most gill raker morphs appear to represent postglacial divergence  <cit>  and there are striking examples of other phenotypic forms that have evolved within the past few thousand years  <cit> .

cases like these pose significant challenges in the context of setting conservation priorities. are similar phenotypes mono- or polyphyletic in origin? how much of the phenotypic diversity represents long-term evolutionary processes  and how much represents more recent  evolution? how should the outcomes of recent versus longer-term evolution be weighted in conservation priorities? important components of these questions involve the estimation of long- and short-term adaptive divergence and reproductive isolation  <cit> .

the north sea and jutland peninsula region  are interesting both in terms of geology and freshwater fish biogeography. immediately after the last glaciation, ca.  <dig>  years bp, the current north sea, the jutland peninsula and the continent to the south was one coherent land mass. the postglacial elbe river extended through this region and had its outlet in the current skagerrak sea, which was at that time a trough separating norway and sweden from jutland. west flowing rivers in the jutland peninsula were tributaries to the postglacial elbe river thus constituting one large river system. as glaciers melted, the sea level started to rise, and eventually the melting of the gigantic ice masses of the north american wisconsinan glaciers from ca.  <dig>  -  <dig>  years bp led to the formation of the current north sea, isolating the rivers of western jutland from the elbe river system. today, a number of freshwater fish species including grayling  and dace  are found only in rivers draining to the north sea, presumably reflecting recolonization via the postglacial elbe river system and absence of immigration via the baltic sea  <cit> . european lake whitefish  shows a similar distribution pattern, although it spread further via ancient waterway connections into the limfjord in northern jutland and further to a few rivers, including the gudenaa river on the jutland east coast  <cit>  .

the north sea houting , categorised by traditional taxonomy as c. oxyrhynchus, is a morphologically and ecologically divergent form of whitefish. its most prominent feature is an elongated snout, which on average constitutes  <dig> % of the total fork length . conversely, in lake whitefish  from the same geographical region the relative snout length is  <dig> %, and the differences are statistically significant  biologi i vidå-systemet. aarhus, denmark: institute of biology, university of aarhus;  <dig>  m.sc. thesis). the feature of an elongated snout is nevertheless not unique to nsh, and has also been described in other populations  <cit> . however, what makes nsh stand out within the c. lavaretus complex is its ability to tolerate oceanic salinities  <cit> . anadromy is not uncommon within this complex, involving migration into brackish environments such as fjords and the baltic sea with salinities ranging from near zero to approx.  <dig> ‰. in contrast, nsh undertakes feeding migrations into the north sea, where salinity is approx.  <dig> ‰  <cit> .

nsh was previously distributed throughout the wadden sea area, a coastal zone of the north sea extending from southern jutland to the netherlands characterized by huge tidal flats, where it spawned in tributary rivers, including major rivers like the rhine and the elbe. at present, all but one extant and indigenous population of nsh remains in the danish vidaa river, due to extensive pollution and habitat degradation. however, its species and conservation status is controversial. based on microsatellite and mitochondrial dna analysis hansen et al.  <cit>  found nsh to be closely related to other danish elw populations, but did not rule out that it represented a recent speciation event. similarly, Østbye et al.  <cit>  analysed mitochondrial dna variation in populations of the c. lavaretus complex encompassing most of its distributional range in europe and found that nsh did not constitute a divergent lineage relative to other populations. finally, freyhof & schöter  <cit>  analysed snout length and gill raker numbers in preserved specimens of whitefish from extant and extinct populations. they concluded that the remaining extant nsh population represents the same species as other danish whitefish , whereas the "true" nsh  was restricted to the rhine river region but is now extinct. however, the basis for this conclusion must be considered questionable, as homoplasy for morphological traits is common within coregonus  <cit> .

the extant nsh population is now subject to a large-scale rehabilitation programme, which involves habitat restoration and removal of impassable dams in rivers along the danish wadden sea coast. nsh has also been reintroduced into other danish and german rivers in the region. nevertheless, knowledge of the evolutionary history of nsh and its relationships to elw populations in the region remains scarce. the studies undertaken so far have either focused on the evolutionary history of the c. lavaretus complex on a large geographical scale  <cit>  or made deductions about genetic relationships based on estimates of genetic differentiation  <cit> . both in the context of setting conservation priorities and understanding the dynamics of postglacial phenotypic divergence there is an important need to obtain specific knowledge of historical and contemporary gene flow and to assess reproductive isolation between nsh and elw.

we analysed variation at  <dig> microsatellite dna loci in  <dig> populations of the c. lavaretus complex . one elw population was from the baltic sea, five populations represented elw from the north sea region, and nsh was represented by samples from the extant vidaa river and samples from two rivers subject to reintroduction efforts. temporal samples from 1977– <dig> and to the present were available from the vidaa  and the ringkøbing fjord  populations.

information about the sampled populations, year of sampling, sample codes, source of dna, taxonomic status, geographical region of the sample localities, the indigenous or reintroduced status of populations and sample size. elw denotes european lake whitefish  and nsh north sea houting .

the main objectives of the study were to analyze postglacial recolonization patterns and assess the evolutionary distinctiveness of nsh vs. elw. this was achieved by analysing contemporary and historical gene flow and reproductive isolation between populations. based on these results we assessed whether nsh fulfils the criteria of the biological species concept  <cit> , and we used the frameworks described by waples  <cit> , moritz  <cit> , crandall et al.  <cit>  and green  <cit>  for assessing its conservation priority.

methods
samples and populations
we analysed  <dig> samples from  <dig> populations, summarized in table  <dig>  all except two populations are anadromous, but only nsh populations migrate into a fully saline environment, whereas the other populations migrate into brackish environments . two of the samples  consisted of archived scale samples, whereas the remaining samples consisted of adipose fin clips stored in 96% ethanol. the fish were caught either by electrofishing  or by net .

microsatellite dna analysis
dna was extracted from tissue samples using either phenol-chloform extraction  <cit>  or proteinase k – chelex extraction  <cit> . dna from archived scale samples were extracted using a phenol-chloform extraction procedure modified for "ancient" dna  <cit> . twelve microsatellite loci were analysed: sfo <dig>  <cit> , bwf <dig> and bwf <dig>  <cit> , bfro <dig>  <cit> , c2- <dig>  <cit> , cocl-lav <dig>  cocl-lav <dig>  cocl-lav <dig>  cocl-lav <dig>  cocl-lav <dig>  cocl-lav <dig> and cocl-lav <dig>  <cit> . details about pcr conditions, electrophoresis and scoring are given in  <cit> .

statistical analyses
deviations from hardy-weinberg equilibrium were tested by exact tests  <cit>  using genepop  <dig> d  <cit> . genetic variation within samples was quantified by observed  and expected  heterozygosity, and by allelic richness  <cit> , a measure of the number of alleles independent of sample size.

we tested for outlier status and possible selection at each of the microsatellite loci using the method and software fdist <dig>  <cit> . we assumed a model of  <dig> populations exchanging migrants and sample sizes of  <dig> individuals and further based the simulations on a step-wise mutation model.

genetic differentiation was estimated by θst  <cit>  and by rst, the latter of which incorporates mutational information and assumes a step-wise mutation model  <cit> . the software arlequin  <dig>   <cit>  was used for estimating θst and the significance was tested by permuting individuals  <dig>  times among samples. rst was estimated using spagedi  <dig>   <cit> , and by permuting allele sizes among alleles  it was tested whether rst was significantly higher than θst  <cit> . the genetic relationships among populations were further visualized by a multidimensional scaling plot based on θst between pairs of samples, using vista  <dig> . <dig>  .  <dig>  chapel hill, nc, l.l.thursone psychometric laboratory, university of north carolina). all tests for significance of hardy-weinberg disequilibrium and pairwise θst and rst were corrected for multiple tests by calculating the false dicovery rate   <cit> .

we used the bayesian clustering approach implemented in structure  <dig>   <cit>  for 1) estimating the number of populations/groups represented by the sampled individuals  and 2) assigning individuals to populations without using prior information of the sample of origin. for estimating the most likely k we conducted runs assuming k =  <dig> . <dig>  we assumed an admixture model and correlated allele frequencies. each run consisted of a burn-in of  <dig>  markov chain monte carlo  steps, followed by  <dig>  steps. ten replicates were conducted for each k. we plotted the probability of the data  and the ad hoc statistic Δk  <cit> , the latter of which measures the steepest increase of the probability of k. structure  <dig>  was furthermore used for estimating individual admixture proportions in the var <dig> and var <dig> samples, which represent an introduced nsh population that we suspected had become admixed with elw. we used individuals from vid and rin as baseline samples, chose the option "use popinfo" for vid and rin individuals, assumed an admixture model and correlated allele frequencies, and then estimated individual admixture proportions and their 90% posterior probability intervals for the var <dig> and var <dig> individuals.

population level admixture proportions in var <dig> and var <dig> were analysed using the method and software admix  <dig>   <cit> , with standard deviations estimated based on bootstrapping  <dig>  times over loci. given that admixture was expected to have occurred recently, we did not consider molecular distances between alleles.

contemporary gene flow among most populations was considered unlikely, as this would require migration through highly saline water. however, given that nsh can tolerate oceanic salinities, gene flow may occur between vid, rib and var and the neighbouring rin and nis elw populations. this was analysed using the individual assignment based method bayesass  <dig>   <cit> , which estimates migration rates based on the inferred proportion of immigrants within the past two generations. initial runs showed that genetic differentiation was too low for estimating migration involving vid and rib and rin and nis, respectively, and due to possible hybridization in var  this population was not included. consequently, vid and rib and rin and nis were pooled into two groups of populations. three independent runs showed that  <dig> mcmc steps, of which the first  <dig> steps were burn-in, were sufficient to achieve convergence. we then conducted a final analysis based on  <dig> ×  <dig> mcmc steps, of which  <dig> ×  <dig> steps were burn-in.

we further estimated effective population size  in vid and rin using 1) a temporal method which assumes a closed population  <cit> , and 2) a temporal method which assumes a population open to gene flow and estimates immigration rate  and ne  <cit> . this was based on the temporal samples from vid taken in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and from rin taken in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  when ne and m was estimated for vid, all temporal samples from rin were pooled to represent a possible source of migrants and vice versa. we assumed a generation length of  <dig> years for nsh  <cit>  and for rin elw we estimated the mean age of reproduction to be  <dig>   years based on unpublished data from scale readings, and used this value as a proxy for generation length.

historical gene flow and effective population size was analysed as implemented in the software migrate  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the method is based on a coalescence model with mutation and migration and estimates a measure of effective population size, θ, defined as 4neμ, where μ denotes mutation rate, and migration m, defined as m/μ, where m denotes migration rate. to provide unscaled parameters we estimated mutation rates for the individual loci based on an analysis of the gud sample using the method msvar  <dig>   <cit> . this approach yielded mutation rates ranging from  <dig>  × 10- <dig> to  <dig>  × 10- <dig> for individual loci, with a geometric mean value of  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  this value corresponds well with an estimate of mutation rate for microsatellite loci in cyprinus carpio of  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  <cit>  and a mean mutation rate of ca. 10- <dig> for microsatellites in humans  <cit> . we assumed a step-wise mutation model and based estimates on fifteen short  and five long  chains. to ensure convergence, we used the "adaptive heating" option with one "cold" and three "hot" chains. three runs were conducted, with run number two and three using the estimates of the previous run as starting parameters. the results did not change much after the first analysis, suggesting that convergence had been achieved, and we report the results of the third run. we omitted the rib and var populations from the analyses, as they are assumed to represent introduced populations, and we used the most recent samples from the vid and rin populations .

finally, we estimated historical effective population sizes, migration rates and splitting time between the vid and rin populations using the bayesian, coalescence and mcmc based method ima  <cit> . the method assumes an isolation-with-gene-flow model, where a single population at some point back in time splits into two, which are subsequently connected by some level of gene flow. the following parameters are estimated: θa, the effective population size in the ancestral population prior to splitting; θ <dig> and θ <dig>  the effective population size of population  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, after splitting; m <dig> and m <dig>  the migration rate from population  <dig> into population  <dig> and vice versa; and t, the point back in time when the ancestral population split into two. all parameters are scaled by mutation rate. to provide unscaled parameters we used the same mutation rate estimate as described for migrate . we conducted several initial runs and found that a heated chain approach with  <dig> chains  and an initial burn-in of  <dig> mcmc steps followed by  <dig> ×  <dig> steps was required to reach convergence. we assumed a generation time of four years and the following additional parameters: q <dig> = q <dig> = qa =  <dig>  m <dig> = m <dig> =  <dig> and t =  <dig> 

RESULTS
genetic variation and relationships among populations
variation at the  <dig> microsatellite loci ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> alleles . eleven significant deviations from hardy-weinberg equilibrium were observed among a total of  <dig> tests . three deviations were observed at the locus sfo <dig> and three at locus cocl-lav <dig>  however, there were no general patterns suggesting null alleles at these loci, although we cannot rule out that null alleles may be present at varying frequencies among populations.

θst  <cit>  among all populations was moderate but statistically highly significant . a test for outlier status of individual loci using fdist <dig>  <cit>  identified one locus, cocl-lav <dig>  as a significant outlier . this locus showed low variation , and one allele  exhibited a frequency of  <dig>  in vid, whereas another allele  was present at a frequency of  <dig>  in ros. we were unable to distinguish if diversifying selection is acting on this locus or if the strong differentiation is due to a combination of a signal of postglacial recolonization and low variability. however, we omitted the locus from analyses based on coalescence , where selection at a locus could result in seriously misleading outcomes.

pairwise θst between all samples showed low and mainly non-significant differentiation between temporal samples from the nsh population vid and the elw population rin, whereas significant differentiation was observed between temporal samples of nsh from rib and var . significant differentiation was evident between samples of nsh from vid and rib vs. the two geographically most proximate elw populations, rin and nis . curiously, however, the var sample from  <dig> showed closer genetic relationships to the rin and nis elw samples  compared to the var sample from  <dig>  the gud elw population showed relatively close relationships to rin and nis and more distant relationships to the other populations. both limfjord populations  and particularly the baltic sea population ros, showed strong genetic differentiation to other populations .

θst  <cit>   and rst  <cit>   between all pairs of samples, along with tests of their significance. samples of north sea houting are denoted by boldface. * significant at the 5% level, ** significant at the 1% level, *** significant at the  <dig> % level

a multidimensional scaling plot based on pairwise θst values identified four groups of samples separated along dimensions  <dig> and  <dig> . the first consisted of nsh samples from vid and rib along with the var sample from  <dig>  the second consisted of elw samples from rin, nis and gud. the var sample from  <dig> was intermediate between these two groups. the two limfjord populations kil and fly formed a third group, whereas the fourth group consisted only of ros, which was distinct from all other populations. applying other genetic distances, such as nei's da  <cit>  yielded essentially similar results.

rst was  <dig>   among all populations. pairwise rst values between samples are shown in table  <dig>  if rst > fst  this would imply that mutation as opposed to drift plays a significant role in creating genetic differentiation among populations, suggesting that divergence has occurred over very long time scales. however, the test for rst > θst  <cit>  yielded no evidence for a higher rst than θst among all samples. tests between pairs of populations, after pooling temporal samples within populations, also yielded no significant outcomes across all loci . at the single locus level,  <dig> tests among a total of  <dig> tests yielded p-values <  <dig>  . five of these involved the locus sfo <dig> and the ros population, which was the most divergent population in terms of θst , whereas thirteen tests involved the locus bwf <dig> and samples of north sea houting from vid, rib and var. thus, we do not entirely rule out that mutation has played a minor role in generating genetic divergence, but drift has played the predominant role.

bayesian clustering of individuals
replicate estimation of the probability of the data  using structure  <dig>   <cit>  and assuming k =  <dig> . <dig> showed that p reached a plateau for k =  <dig> . conversely, estimation of Δk, which measures the steepest increase in p  <cit> , was clearly highest for k =  <dig> . inspection of the partition of individuals showed that individuals from nsh samples were split from the remaining populations at k =  <dig>  but k =  <dig> and  <dig> provided further partitioning of populations. assuming k >  <dig> did not identify more groups, and we therefore conclude that k =  <dig> captures most of the biological information in the data. the partitioning of individuals at k =  <dig> is shown in fig.  <dig>  the first cluster consists of individuals from nsh populations , and the second cluster consists of individuals from the elw populations rin, nis and gud. interestingly, the var <dig> and particularly var <dig> samples appear to consist of a mixture of these two groups. this analysis, involving all samples and not making use of learning samples, does not resolve whether or not interbreeding occurs between nsh and elw. consequently, we conducted more detailed analyses of individual admixture proportions in var using vid and rin as baseline samples and assuming k =  <dig> . the third cluster consists of the populations fly and partly kil, both from the limfjord region, whereas the ros population from the baltic sea makes up the fourth cluster. analyses of the four clusters separately did not identify additional groups .

contemporary gene flow and effective population size
contemporary gene flow estimated using bayesass  <dig>   <cit>  was very low:  <dig>   from nsh to elw  and  <dig>   from elw to nsh .

effective population size  estimated using a temporal method assuming no migration  <cit>  yielded values of  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, in vid and rin . using a method which assumes a population open to gene flow and which simultaneously estimates ne and m   <cit>  yielded very low m values, i.e.  <dig>  in vid and  <dig>  in rin. however, under this assumption ne estimates differed considerably;  <dig> in vid and  <dig> in rin , demonstrating that ne estimates with this method are highly sensitive towards inferred migration rates  <cit> .

estimates of effective population size  and migration rate  and their 95% confidence intervals in vid and rin, using two temporal methods assuming a closed population  <cit>  and a population open to gene flow  <cit> , respectively.

historical gene flow and splitting time
analysis of historical demographic parameters using migrate  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  yielded θ values ranging between  <dig>   and  <dig>   . assuming a geometric mean mutation rate of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> as estimated for the loci analysed in this study, this would correspond to historical ne estimates ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  historical migration rate estimates, m, ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . assuming the same mutation rate as above this corresponds to migration rates ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig> . the direction of migration and approximate migration rates are shown in fig.  <dig>  the results suggest historical migration in a north-eastern direction from vid, along the jutland north sea coast and via the limfjord, with bidirectional gene flow occuring within regions . ros from the baltic sea was the most isolated population.

estimation of splitting time between the indigenous nsh population vid and the geographically most proximate elw population rin using the ima software  <cit>  resulted in a scaled splitting time parameter, t, of  <dig>  . assuming the estimated mutation rate of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> this corresponds to  <dig> years before present . the inferred estimates of historical ne and m showed good correspondence with those obtained using migrate .

estimates of historical demographic parameters and their 90% credible intervals in vid and rin, analysed using ima  <cit>  and assuming that these two populations have split from a common ancestral population. parameters scaled by mutation rate and unscaled parameters are provided. scaled parameters: θ <dig>  θ <dig>  θa = historical effective population size in vid, rin and the ancestral population, respectively, m <dig>  m <dig> = migration rate from rin to vid and vid to rin, respectively, and t = splitting time. unscaled parameters: n <dig>  n <dig>  na = historical effective population size  in vid, rin and the ancestral population, respectively, m <dig>  m <dig> = migration rate  from rin to vid and vid to rin, respectively, and t = splitting time .

admixture analyses
several of the analyses suggested that the var population, which was supposed to represent nsh reintroduced from vid, was in fact admixed with elw. we obtained information that the var river had been stocked with elw in the 1980s originating from either kil or rin . however, the results using structure  <dig>   pointed to rin or nis as the most likely contributors rather than kil. analysis of admixture proportions using admix  <dig>   <cit>  and assuming vid, rin and kil as baseline populations showed a negative admixture proportion of kil in the var <dig> sample, suggesting that kil had not contributed to admixture, whereas vid and rin contributed approx.  <dig> and 20%, respectively . a positive, albeit small admixture proportion of kil , was found in the var <dig> sample, whereas vid contributed 50% and rin 41% . thus, we conclude that var is an admixed population with the major proportions contributed by vid and rin, whereas kil has made a minor, if any contribution.

admixture proportions in samples of putative nsh from var, taken in  <dig> and  <dig>  baseline samples consisted of nsh from vid and elw from rin and kil. the analyses were conducted using the method and software admix  <dig>   <cit> .

we further used structure  <dig>   <cit>  for analysing individual admixture proportions  in var <dig> and var <dig> using vid and rin as learning samples. in the var <dig> sample there was limited evidence for hybridization, although two individuals showed intermediate q values . the var <dig> sample, however, contained several individuals showing intermediate q values and with 90% confidence intervals not including  <dig> and  <dig> . a total of  <dig> individuals  showed individual admixture proportions of rin ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . we cannot be certain that they all represent admixed individuals and the results do not allow for distinguishing f <dig> hybrids from backcrosses. nevertheless, the results provide evidence that nsh and elw are not reproductively isolated when they occur in sympatry.

discussion
our study's results suggest that the sampled populations constitute four major groups, one of which represents nsh, and that all populations except ros from the baltic sea show modest genetic differentiation, presumably reflecting a recent common ancestry and a single postglacial recolonization event. moreover, the two geographically closest indigenous populations of nsh and elw  must be considered reproductively isolated at present but have nevertheless split recently, perhaps within the past few thousand years. finally, nsh and elw appear to interbreed where they have been brought into contact in one locality . we discuss these findings below along with their implications for species designation and for prioritizing populations for conservation.

postglacial recolonization and genetic population structure
subfossil remains of fish from the coregonus lavaretus complex, northern pike , burbot , ruffe  and smelt  have all been recovered from a lake deposit in northern jutland and dated to approximately  <dig>  years bp  <cit> . hence, whitefish were among the first freshwater fish species to recolonize the jutland peninsula. in general, whitefishes, northern pike and burbot exhibit a circumpolar distribution and bear genetic signatures of rapid postglacial expansion  <cit> , thereby conforming to the definition of pioneer species sensu hewitt  <cit> . there was moderate genetic differentiation among all samples  and the tests for rst > θst  <cit>  suggested that mutation has played a minor role in generating population differentiation. this indeed suggests rapid recolonization of the jutland peninsula, predominantly from a single source. the inferred direction of historical gene flow  also supports a recolonization event from the south to north via the postglacial elbe river system and further into the limfjord, though some historical migration may also have occurred in the opposite direction within regions. this result is in accordance with the study by Østbye et al.  <cit>  based on mitochondrial dna sequence data, which suggested a northward expansion of a central european lineage, encompassing the jutland peninsula. however, this study also found a minor contribution of a separate northern european lineage in several danish populations, a finding that would be difficult to confirm by analyzing microsatellite dna markers. moreover, our results do not allow for distinguishing whether this admixture of lineages occurred prior to postglacial recolonization, or if a separate minor recolonization event by the northern european lineage took place.

the bayesian clustering of individuals  might at first seem to contradict a common source of recolonization of all populations, given that elw from rin, nis and gud formed one cluster, whereas the two populations from the limfjord, kil and fly, formed a separate cluster. these latter two populations are interspersed between nis and gud on the supposed route of recolonization via the elbe river , so it seems illogical that they should not belong to the same cluster. however, whereas the environment in gud has been relatively stable in the long term, the limfjord is a highly dynamic region, which has experienced repeated opening and closure of the connection to the north sea. the latest disconnection from the north sea lasted from ca.  <dig> to  <dig>  and during that period the main part of the limfjord was brackish and supported large populations of elw  <cit> . in  <dig>  a storm reconnected the limfjord and the north sea, and the increased salinity caused immediate extirpation of most whitefish. the fly and kil populations can be considered remnants of these large populations, and we suggest that repeated extinctions, recolonizations and population size fluctuations during cycles of brackish and high salinity conditions have led to stronger drift and changes in allele frequencies as compared to other danish elw populations.

whereas gene flow has occurred historically between populations, they must now be considered reproductively isolated, although contemporary gene flow might still take place between certain elw populations owing to their low genetic differentiation . the region inhabited by rin and nis is marshy with several smaller lakes and rivers, which could become connected at high water levels. hence, occasional gene flow is certainly a possibility. available temporal ne estimates  in rin and vid, were also relatively high . detailed analyses of the demographic history of vid further showed that ne has been stable over the past ca.  <dig> years  <cit> . we cannot be certain that current ne is also high in the other samples for which temporal samples were not available. however, since historical ne  did not vary much among populations , it is reasonable to assume that all populations are relatively large. hence, nsh and elw of the jutland peninsula can be described as a system of relatively large populations sharing a common postglacial ancestry, which are now reproductively isolated and potentially following separate evolutionary trajectories.

reproductive isolation and species designation
the taxonomy of the coregonus lavaretus complex is chaotic and numerous species have been described  <cit> . these species designations have been based on the phylogenetic species concept  <cit> , which defines species as the smallest lineages or population groups that can be united by synapomorphic characters, i.e. shared characters derived from a common ancestor. nsh has traditionally been considered a species  separate from elw  based particularly on its elongated snout and its ability to tolerate oceanic salinities  <cit> . it has also sometimes been denoted as a high gill raker morph, although by comparison to other c. lavaretus populations the gill raker numbers must be considered intermediate; the mean gill raker number is  <dig>   in vid vs. a range of mean values from  <dig>  –  <dig>  in other european populations, and a range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in rin, nis, fly and gud . hence, gill raker number does not separate nsh from geographically proximate elw populations. on the other hand, nsh is distinct by showing a higher age at reproduction than elw;  <dig>  years in nsh from vid vs.  <dig>  years in elw from rin , and a considerably higher mean length at reproduction in vid than in rin  biologi i vidå-systemet. aarhus, denmark: institute of biology, university of aarhus;  <dig>  m.sc. thesis). all together, these characters might justify separate species designation of nsh adopting a phylogenetic species concept, but the lack of demonstration of the genetic basis of these characters and absence of analysis of phenotype-environment associations would inevitably cast doubt on this classification.

from an evolutionary biology perspective, adoption of the biological species concept  <cit>  is more satisfactory, as it directly addresses the issue of reproductive isolation; species are defined as biological entities that show reproductive isolation even when they occur in sympatry. the presence of both elw and nsh in var provides a rare opportunity for testing reproductive isolation in sympatry, and the results suggest interbreeding in the var <dig> sample, as  <dig> out of  <dig> individuals showed individual admixture coefficients ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . it is puzzling that there is a lower contribution of elw and fewer hybrids in the var <dig> sample. based on records from  <dig> we assume that this is due to biased sampling, where individuals with elw morphology were omitted.

the results suggest that nsh and elw may not qualify as separate species according to a biological species concept. the acid test would involve demonstration of interbreeding beyond the f <dig> generation and lack of postzygotic selection against hybrids, which could otherwise act to maintain species integrity despite interbreeding. there was insufficient statistical power in the structure analyses to unambiguously identify backcrosses, which would require analysis of many more loci given the relatively low genetic differentiation  <cit> . it should be noted that further analyses using the method newhybrids  <cit>  yielded qualitatively similar results, but also failed to distinguish f <dig> hybrids from f <dig> and backcrosses .

a more pragmatic alternative to the biological species concept would be mallet's concept of genotypic clusters  <cit> , where species are identified as groups of individuals separated into discrete clusters of genetic variation. this concept allows for interbreeding between species as long as clustering is maintained. nsh and elw have recently come into contact in var and some discreteness of clustering would be expected even in the case of random mating. however, continuous monitoring of individual clustering using structure could provide a test of species integrity according to the concept of genotypic clusters.

although nsh and elw do not show reproductive isolation in var, their sympatric occurrence is an artefact resulting from stocking. different statistical methods based on fundamentally different principles  <cit>  all suggest contemporary reproductive isolation between allopatric nsh and elw populations. however, estimated splitting time between vid and rin was surprisingly recent, ranging between  <dig> –  <dig> years under the assumption of the estimated mutation rate of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> . the formation of the wadden sea dates back to the rise of sea level  <dig>  –  <dig>  years bp, though it has since then been a dynamic region  <cit> . the estimate of splitting time is highly dependent on the assumed mutation rate, and it would require only a slightly lower mutation rate,  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  for the 90% credible interval for splitting time to encompass  <dig>  years. we therefore conclude that nsh and elw have split within the past few thousand years, but we are unable to provide a more exact timing. given that nsh inhabits the wadden sea area we find it most plausible that its divergence is associated with the formation of this marine region.

the question remains whether the vid population is in fact a remnant of a single species or morph previously distributed throughout the wadden sea region. coregonids show extensive potential for homoplasy in morphological traits  <cit> , and the possibility certainly exists that similar morphs have evolved repeatedly and independently within the region from the rhine river in the south to the varde river in the north. answering this question would require analysis of samples from other, now extinct populations. analysis of dna from archived historical samples, such as scales, is probably the only option for resolving this issue  <cit> .

conservation priorities
questioning species designation can be contentious, as species have previously been conceived as the primary units for conservation. however, it is becoming increasingly apparent that conservation should also recognize intraspecific diversity to conserve the evolutionary legacy of species  <cit> . in the following we apply four different approaches for defining conservation units to the case of nsh vs. elw.

the evolutionarily significant unit  concept as defined by waples  <cit>  states that an esu is a population or group of populations that shows substantial reproductive isolation from other populations and constitutes an important component of the evolutionary legacy of the species. under natural circumstances nsh does show reproductive isolation from elw populations in the region. however, most allopatric elw would also fulfill that criterion. nsh is also morphologically distinct and shows adaptation to oceanic salinities. the latter property could be regarded as an important component of the evolutionary legacy of the c. lavaretus complex, though it ranks as one among a number of other recently evolved remarkable features found among populations within the complex . hence, nsh would qualify as an esu, but so would numerous other recently diverged forms. this would be biologically defendable  <cit> , but would lead to a very large number of units with limited resources to protect them all. on the scale of the north sea region and the jutland peninsula, nsh would stand out more clearly as a distinct unit.

the second approach by moritz  <cit>  adopts the criteria that esus should exhibit reciprocal monophyly for mtdna haplotypes and significant genetic differentiation at nuclear loci. this approach operates with a second category, management units , i.e. populations showing significant differentiation at nuclear loci but not reciprocal monophyly at mtdna. as this esu definition stresses the time-frame over which populations have been reproductively isolated, it is unsurprising that nsh does not qualify as an esu; mtdna haplotypes in nsh vs. neighbouring elw populations do not show reciprocal monophyly  <cit> . instead, the three phylogeographical lineages identified by Østbye et al.  <cit>  would be designated as esus. given the significant differentiation at microsatellite loci, nsh would be categorized as an mu within the central european lineage, but most of the other studied populations would also be granted mu status.

crandall et al.'s  <cit>  framework for defining conservation units assesses both reproductive isolation and adaptive divergence by considering hypotheses of genetic exchangeability  and ecological exchangeability . moreover, these criteria are considered on both a contemporary and historical time scale. we reject the hypothesis of contemporary genetic exchangeability between all populations. if we define historical exchangeability as dating back to postglacial recolonization, then we accept the hypothesis of historical genetic exchangeability of all populations. however, if "historical" is defined as pre-dating major anthropogenic influence, tentatively  <dig> years bp, then we reject the hypothesis for most populations, including vid vs. rin.

the data on ecological exchangeability is much scarcer. we are not aware of any adaptive divergence among the elw populations of the study. this, however, does not preclude that adaptive divergence actually exists. the only feature that really stands out is high salinity tolerance in vid  and we therefore reject the hypothesis of contemporary ecological exchangeability between nsh and elw. there are no long-term data relating to ecological exchangeability. if we consider a postglacial time-scale, then we would assume that ecological exchangeability existed, while it is most likely that high salinity tolerance was present in vid  if we consider a time scale of  <dig> years bp. depending on the definition of historical exchangeability the recommendation would then be to treat vid  as a distinct species  or a distinct population .

finally, the designatable unit  described by green  <cit>  is closely related to waples' esu definition  <cit> , but additionally takes extinction risk into account. as previously discussed, nsh must be considered a separate unit, though its uniqueness depends on the scale considered. it is virtually impossible to assess extinction risk across the whole c. lavaretus complex, but on a local scale none of the studied elw populations are considered endangered. the vid population appears stable and not immediately endangered  <cit>  but is nevertheless the only remaining indigenous population of nsh. hence, nsh and the vid population would qualify as a designatable unit, but its conservation priority and need for a recovery plan would require more detailed analysis of extinction risk.

altogether, nsh stands out as a separate conservation unit, although its distinctiveness varies considerably depending on the framework applied. moreover, prioritization depends on the spatial or temporal scale considered, with highest prioritization granted on finer or shorter scales.

the current rehabilitation program for nsh is based on restoring habitat in four rivers in the danish region of the wadden sea, including the vidaa river. these rivers harbour a number of other endangered species listed in the berne convention on the conservation of european wildlife and natural habitats. this includes the last remnants of indigenous atlantic salmon  populations in the region from the jutland peninsula to northern france  <cit> , twaite shad  and sea lamprey , all of which would benefit from a nsh conservation program. thus, an integrated approach combining conservation priority of nsh relative to other c. lavaretus forms with principles for identifying areas of importance for biodiversity conservation  <cit>  might be a fruitful way to settle uncertainties, and would undoubtedly result in higher priority for the rehabilitation program as a whole.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that fishes of the c. lavaretus complex that have recolonized the jutland peninsula after the last glaciation are the result of recolonization, which mainly or exclusively took place via the ancient elbe river system. the present populations arose due to vicariance following rising sea levels that disconnected water bodies from the elbe river.

based on all existing scientific information, nsh is genetically and ecologically distinct albeit closely related to elw populations in the same region. in particular, the ability of nsh to tolerate high salinities is unique within the c. lavaretus complex. estimates of splitting time suggest that divergence has occurred within the past few thousand years. natural gene flow does not occur at present between nsh and elw, but the observation of interbreeding in one location where they have been brought into contact by stocking, suggests that reproductive isolation is incomplete. depending on the degree of interbreeding beyond the f <dig> level and the presence or absence of postzygotic reproductive barriers this may call the separate species status of nsh and elw into question, and nsh is perhaps best regarded as an ecologically and morphologically divergent morph and incipient species. nsh should be managed separately from elw populations in the region, but the degree to which it should be prioritized depends on the spatial or temporal scale considered.

the case of the north sea houting and european lake whitefish provides an important example of postglacially evolved biodiversity in the northern hemisphere. it also illustrates the challenges for setting conservation priorities for species complexes exhibiting a shallow phylogeny but potentially considerable phenotypic and adaptive diversity. even though analysis of molecular markers may greatly increase knowledge about genetic contingency and reproductive isolation, evidence for adaptive divergence in most cases remains scarce and circumstantial, unless demanding tests such as common garden experiments are conducted. there are also no ideal frameworks available for assessing conservation priorities at the subspecific level. even putatively objective methods involve subjectivity, such as defining time scales for historical exchangeability using crandall et al.'s  <cit>  approach or defining the geographical scales to consider. this calls for pragmatism, where the subjectivity involved is acknowledged and clearly presented. finally, just as identification of conservation units should consider intraspecific biodiversity, our study shows that consideration of biodiversity at the species level in the region of interest may help to settle otherwise unclear cases of conservation priorities.
