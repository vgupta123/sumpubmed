BACKGROUND
the united states dog agility association  alone, registers over  <dig>  competitors and organizes over  <dig> days of agility competitions each year in the united states, puerto rico, canada, mexico, bermuda, and japan
 <cit> . the percentage of dogs injured during agility exercise is estimated at 33%
 <cit> . with such a high rate of injury, determining the effects of this type of exercise on the physiologic responses of dogs including the degree of oxidant stress and eicosanoid production induced by this exercise, is important to understanding why injury rates are so high.

canine agility exercise has been shown to induce significant increases in blood lactate and hence an anaerobic metabolic state
 <cit> . in addition, plasma chloride, hematocrit, and triglycerides increase with agility exercise whereas, serum albumin, calcium and phosphorus concentrations decrease immediately after this exercise
 <cit> . no alteration in plasma protein, sodium, potassium or creatinine concentrations has been found with agility exercise in dogs
 <cit> . the alterations that do occur have been attributed to splenic contraction in addition to increased movement of fluid from the interstitium into the vascular space, and subsequently into contracting muscle cells
 <cit> . therefore, there is an overall minimal change in plasma volume in dogs during agility exercise but a tremendous necessity for anaerobic metabolism. a wide variety of dog breeds participate in agility events, and there are a wide variety of competition levels in the sport. hence, due to differences in fitness and innate athletic ability, some dogs may experience greater effects of exertion than others during physical activity in agility. the effect of skill and intensity level on specific physiologic variables in agility competition dogs is unknown.

exercise increases the rate of oxygen consumption, subsequently resulting in the production of free radicals or reactive oxygen species. the reactive oxygen species cause lipid peroxidation and cell injury, which may overwhelm cellular antioxidant mechanisms
 <cit> . in humans, intense exercise induces acute oxidant stress, reflected by increased 15f2t isoprostane excretion in urine
 <cit> . isosprostanes form when arachidonic acid reacts with reactive oxygen species in cell membranes and they are considered a marker of oxidant activity and lipid peroxidation in vivo in humans and several other species
 <cit> . the period of time required for recovery from exercise-induced oxidant damage is unknown, but in humans, isoprostane production returned to baseline within  <dig> hours following exercise
 <cit> . in sled dogs undergoing endurance exercise, plasma isoprostanes increase following exercise and correlate with the logarithm of serum creatinine kinase activity, a marker of muscle damage
 <cit> . to the authors’ knowledge, the excretion of 15f2t isoprostanes in the urine of dogs following agility exercise has not been previously reported nor have hematological and biochemical parameters been followed for 4-hours post agility exercise and compared between skill groups.

exercise in horses and humans induces an inflammatory response and has been shown to alter eicosanoid production
 <cit> . dogs experience an anaerobic metabolic state during agility exercise with increases in plasma lactate, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count, however to the authors’ knowledge, the effects of agility exercise on eicosanoid production in dogs of different skill levels has not been previously investigated
 <cit> .

the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of agility exercise on dogs of different skill levels with respect to 15f2t isoprostane, thromboxane b <dig> , 6-keto prostaglandin f1α , prostaglandin e <dig> metabolites , and  <dig> -dihydro-15-keto prostaglandin f2α excretion in the urine and systemic hematological and biochemical changes in the plasma; and to determine if alterations in these parameters had resolved within  <dig> hours of the high intensity exercise.

methods
animals
the study protocol was approved by the oregon state university animal care and use committee and written informed consent was obtained from all owners of dogs participating in the study prior to participation of the dogs. a local agility dog club was contacted and volunteers were requested to participate in the study. dogs were reported by their owners to be competitors in agility either at the novice , intermediate , or masters classes. dogs earn entry into each class through competition and their scores in those competitions
 <cit> . owners reported how often their dogs trained on a weekly basis and if their dogs were currently receiving any medications. the sex, age and breed of each dog were also recorded. each dog was examined by a veterinarian prior to participating in the agility exercise during which the heart and lungs were auscultated and their gait was examined for signs of lameness or dysfunction. dogs were excluded from the study if they were receiving electrolyte supplements, exhibited signs of lameness the day of the experiment, or had an elevated body temperature prior to beginning the experiment . dogs were not allowed to eat within  <dig> hours prior to the agility test but they were allowed training treats in small amounts following the test. a full meal was not given to any dog until after the 4-hour sample collection was performed. at no time was water consumption restricted from the dogs during the assessment.

agility exercise test
prior to the agility test, a heart rate monitor  was placed around the girth of each dog using an elastic harness. each dog ran a course, consisting of  <dig> jumps and  <dig> tunnels,  <dig> times with a  <dig> minute rests period between the first and second, then second and third runs. the dogs ran the course three times to duplicate the exercise they would experience during an agility competition. the height of the jumps was adjusted for each dog with dogs less than  <dig> inches in height at the shoulder jumping  <dig> inch tall jumps, dogs  <dig> to  <dig> inches tall jumping  <dig> inch tall jumps, dogs  <dig> to  <dig> inches tall jumping  <dig> inch tall jumps and dogs over  <dig> inches jumping  <dig> inch tall jumps
 <cit> . each dog ran the course  <dig> times in succession with a 5-minute rest period between runs one and two and two and three. each dog was allowed to sit, lie down, or walk during the rest period, but not trot or run. each run was timed in seconds with a stopwatch and the times recorded for each dog. the number of missed jumps or obstacles taken out of sequence was also recorded for each dog. heart rate, respiratory rate, and rectal temperature were recorded prior to, immediately following and  <dig> hours following the  <dig> runs through the agility course.

sample collection
blood was collected from each dog within  <dig> hours prior to participating in the agility exercise, and within  <dig> minutes of completing the agility exercise test, and 4-hours after completing the test via jugular venipuncture. blood was placed into edta and lithium heparin tubes immediately following collection, and heparinized blood was immediately submitted for determination of venous blood lactate using an automated blood gas analyzer  for determination of venous blood lactate. packed cell volume and total protein were determined immediately following collection. hematological analyses were performed using the advia  <dig> hematology analyzer , and biochemical parameters with the hitachi  <dig> chemistry analyzer . all hematological and biochemical analyses were performed within  <dig> hours of sample collection. urine was collected from each dog by free catch technique within  <dig> hours prior to the agility exercise test, within  <dig> hour following the test, and within one-half hour of  <dig> hours following the exercise test. urine was stored within  <dig> hour of collection at -80°c until analysis.

isoprostane determination
samples were analyzed in duplicate and in batches according to the manufacturer’s instructions to reduce interassay variation. the isoprostane assay and urinary creatinine assays have undergone extensive analytic validation by the manufacturers, as indicated in the results provided in the package insert. urine 15f2t isoprostane  was determined using a competitive enzyme immunoassay  after sample pre-treatment with β-glucuronidase . a spectrophotometric plate reader was used at 420nm. the specificity of the eia is reported by the manufacturer as 100% cross reactivity for 8-isoprostane and 8-iso prostaglandin f2α ethanolamide,  <dig> % for 8-iso prostaglandin f3α, and 4% for  <dig> -dinor-8-iso porstaglandin f2α. samples were analyzed in duplicate and in batches to reduce interassay variation. this assay has undergone extensive analytic validation by the manufacturers, as indicated in results provided in the package insert. intra-assay coefficient of variation ranged from  <dig> : at  <dig> pg/ml to  <dig> % at  <dig> pg/ml and inter-assay coefficient of variation ranged from  <dig> % at  <dig> pg/ml dose to  <dig> % at  <dig> pg/ml. in-house validation was performed with urine samples previously collected from healthy dogs as part of unrelated, previously published research in dogs
 <cit> . our previous validation of the assay included the assessment of dilutional parallelism of canine urine samples  and determination of interassay variability 
 <cit> .

urinary eicosanoid determination
urine samples were kept at -20°c until analysis for their prostanoid content. thromboxane b <dig> , 11-dehydro-thromboxane b <dig> , 6-keto prostaglandin f1α , prostaglandin e <dig> metabolites , and  <dig> -dihydro-15-keto prostaglandin f2α  are not species-specific compounds and urinary excretion was determined using ace™ competitive enzyme immunoassay  per the manufacturer’s instructions. samples were analyzed in duplicate and batched to reduce interassay variation. the txb <dig> and 11-txb <dig> assays have undergone extensive analytic validation by the manufacturers and use of 11-txb <dig> in canine urine has been validated previously
 <cit> . the pgf1α assay for prostacyclin excretion has undergone extensive analytic validation by the manufacturers and with cross reactivity to prostaglandin d <dig> < <dig> %, prostaglandin f2α=11%, and txb <dig> = <dig> %. the prostaglandin e <dig> metabolite assay used is recommended for analysis of urine for metabolites of pge <dig> since pge <dig> is rapidly converted in vivo to its  <dig> -dihydro-15-keto metabolite which is unstable and rapidly degraded to  <dig> -dihydro-15-keto pga <dig>  the assay used to determine  <dig> -dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin a <dig> and  <dig> -dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin e <dig> concentrations in the urine and has been validated by the manufacturer with cross-reactivity to prostaglandin d <dig>  prostaglandin f2α, 6-keto-prostaglandin f1α, prostaglandin f1α, and txb <dig> < <dig> %. the pgf2α assay has been used for direct quantitation of  <dig> -dihydro-15-keto prostaglandin f2α in urine and the manufacturer has performed extensive analytical validation of the assay with cross reactivity for prostaglandin d <dig>  6-keto-prostaglandin f1α, prostaglandin f1α, and txb2< <dig> %.

urine creatinine concentration was determined using detectx™ competitive enzyme immunoassay  with plates read at spectrophotometer settings at 490nm as per the manufacturer’s instructions. this assay has been validated for use with dog urine by the manufacturer and the intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation were reported as  <dig> % and  <dig> % or less, respectively. results for iso are reported as pg/ml divided by creatinine in mg/dl. results for txb <dig>  pgf1α, prostaglandin e <dig> metabolites, and pgf2α are reported as pg/ml divided by creatinine in mg/dl.

statistical analyses

 <cit> . significance was set at p <  <dig> .

RESULTS
skill groups
fifteen dogs were enrolled in the study. masters dogs were an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>   years of age . novice dogs were  <dig>  ±  <dig> , median  <dig> , range 1- <dig> years, n= 6) which was slightly younger than intermediate level dogs . seven of the  <dig> dogs were spayed females and the rest were neutered males. the masters level dogs had spent  <dig>  ±  <dig>  years performing agility , the intermediate level dogs  <dig>  ±  <dig>   years and the novice level dogs  <dig>  ±  <dig>   years. the height of the jumps was not different between the skill groups  inches, intermediate  <dig> ±  <dig>  , masters  <dig>  ±  <dig>   inches, p> <dig> ). the breeds in the masters level group included two mixed breeds, a border collie, a jack russell terrier, and a pembroke welsh corgi. the intermediate level dogs contained a golden retriever, a belgian terrier, an australian shepherd, and a standard poodle. the novice level group contained a golden retriever, a boxer, a standard poodle, a miniature poodle, a welsh terrier, and a queensland heeler. six of the  <dig> dogs were administered glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate supplements daily. two dogs were intermittently treated with antibiotics and antihistamines for owner reported skin allergies. two other dogs had been previously diagnosed as hypothyroid and were receiving thyroid supplementation that upon testing resulting in serum t <dig> concentrations within the reference range for the lab. the frequency with which each group trained their dogs was not different between the groups and on average the masters level dogs spent  <dig>  ±  <dig>   hours per week in training while the intermediate level dogs spent  <dig>  ±  <dig>   hours and the novice level dogs  <dig>  ±  <dig>   hours per week in training, respectively, p> <dig> .

the time taken to complete the course was significantly different between the skill groups  and for each run . the masters level dogs took the least time to complete their runs  and had the least mistakes  compared to the intermediate level  or novice level dogs , run  <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig>  , run  <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig>   seconds).

hematological profile
results of the hematology analysis are reported in table
 <dig>  red blood cell count , hematocrit , hemoglobin, and serum albumin increased immediately following the agility exercise . albumin decreased to values similar to pre-exercise values by 4-hours following the exercise test, however, rbc, hct and hemoglobin were decreased at 4-hours compared to pre-exercise values. rbc, hct, hemoglobin, and albumin were different in different skill groups; they increased the greatest in the masters group followed by intermediates and the least in the novice dogs immediately after exercise . none of the other hematological parameters examined  were affected by time or skill level of the dogs, p> <dig> .

biochemistry profile
biochemistry parameters are reported for each skill group and time point in table
 <dig>  serum creatinine and total plasma protein were not affected by the exercise test or skill level . lactate increased significantly immediately after the exercise test  and differed between skill groups, table
 <dig> . lactate increased most in the masters skill group, then the intermediate group, and it changed little in the novice dogs following agility exercise. phosphorus increased in dogs immediately after the exercise test and continued to rise 4-hours following the test, with the greatest increase in novice and intermediate dogs and least change in the masters group . creatinine kinase activity increased slightly but not significantly following exercise in all groups . creatinine kinase was affected by skill level of the dogs with the novice group having the highest values . blood urea nitrogen, calcium, sodium, potassium and chloride did not significantly change over time or between dog skill levels, p> <dig> .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the skill levels of the dogs reported in this study was determined by the rules set out by the usdaa and may have seemed arbitrary. the groupings proved accurate in these dogs, however, since each successive skill group was significantly faster than the novice group and the group level below it. the labeling of these groups as novice, intermediate and masters could have been labeled instead by their time through the simulated exercise test, however, this would have been less applicable to dogs in actual agility competition.

agility exercise, as performed by dogs in this study, is of sufficient intensity to induce mild oxidant stress and lipid peroxidation based upon the slightly increased urinary excretion of iso following the exercise test. the intensity of muscle contraction associated with agility exercise increases production of reactive oxygen species due to increased oxygen consumption, resulting in elevated superoxide anion production in skeletal muscle mitochondria
 <cit> . all dogs in this study had similar increases in iso regardless of skill level and speed through the course, indicating that agility exercise routinely stimulates intense muscle contraction and results in mild lipid peroxidation. it is unlikely, given the results reported here, that the mild oxidant stress encountered in a single agility exercise session has a significant effect on physiologic function and performance. previous reports have documented oxidative stress in dogs exercising for  <dig> minutes  and many hours , however, this is the first report, to the authors’ knowledge, of the effect of very short duration, intense exercise on lipid peroxidation and oxidation in the dog
 <cit> . many agility dogs participate in more than one trial in a single day or weekend. in humans, intense exercise elevates urinary iso excretion for  <dig> hours, and following a soccer game, humans experience oxidant stress and reduced performance for up to  <dig> hours
 <cit> . muscle fatigue due to oxidant stress may be a contributing factor to joint injuries, at least in humans
 <cit> . whether oxidant stress plays a role in injury to dogs during agility competition with repeated runs through a course in a single day remains unknown, however determining the level of oxidant stress that develops over time and the length of time before isoprostane production returns to pre-exercise levels in actual agility competition  may be warranted based upon the results of this study and the high incidence of injury following participation in this activity
 <cit> . collection of urine at more precise time points following the agility exercise may have altered the results in our study by reducing variability between the subjects. future research determining other markers of oxidant stress at exact time points prior to and following agility exercise is indicated by the results of this study.

a significant limitation of this study is the use of an eia for determination of f <dig> isoprostanes in the urine of dogs. analysis of the methods used to determine urinary f <dig> isoprostane excretion have found that eia results do not correlate with gas chromatography negative ion chemical ionization-mass spectroscopy  in dogs
 <cit> . the results of this study cannot be compared to other studies, however, mildly increased lipid peroxidation following the intense, short-duration exercise of agility competition occurred in the dogs reported here and was not affected by the speed or training of the dogs. further research, preferably using gc/nici-ms for urinary f <dig> isoprostane determination, is required to determine the extent of oxidant stress induced by this type of exercise in relation to long duration exercise in sled dogs and to disease states including lung injury
 <cit> , neurologic disease
 <cit>  and heart disease
 <cit> . future research is warranted to determine the effect of agility exercise on other parameters of oxidant stress including glutathione, glutathione-peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase.

another limitation of this study is the lack of data regarding antioxidant status in these dogs. antioxidants are either supplements or endogenous mechanisms of consumption or removal of reactive oxygen species and include superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathioperoxidase, glutathione reductase, vitamin e, vitamin c, and ubiquinone
 <cit> . hunting dogs exercised for  <dig> minutes to  <dig> hours duration decrease their biological antioxidant potential following the exercise but the return of this potential is within one hour
 <cit> . determination of antioxidant status may be warranted in future studies of dogs participating in agility exercise.

the plasma lactate increased markedly in the dogs following the exercise test. the changes in plasma lactate were inversely proportional to the speed through the course . plasma lactate concentration at a specific speed or level of intensity is strongly correlated to physical fitness in horses as well as human athletes
 <cit> . in the current study, all three skill groups had normal plasma lactate concentrations by  <dig> hours after exercise, indicating that recovery from lactic acidosis in agility dogs occurs quickly, similar to other athletic events, and before recovery from oxidative stress
 <cit> .

in greyhounds following high intensity sprint exercise, plasma lactate increased to  <dig>  meq/l or more, and similar to the dogs reported here, returns to baseline in less than  <dig> hours following the exercise
 <cit> . during field trial competition, labrador retrievers also increase plasma lactate concentrations similar to the masters level dogs in this study
 <cit> . increased plasma lactate was most likely the result of anaerobic metabolism in contracting muscles during the sprint exercise
 <cit> . studies of the greyhound have indicated that this breed has higher concentrations of type ii fast twitch muscle fibers
 <cit> . these fibers have the greatest glycolytic/anaerobic capacity and therefore are capable of producing large amounts of lactate during high intensity exercise
 <cit> . the relative amount of muscle fiber types present in the dogs in this study is unknown, however, a higher percentage of type ii fibers may have resulted in greater increases in plasma lactate following the exercise test and significantly shorter times through the agility course. elite sprinters in men and horses have higher proportions of type ii fibers than their slower counterparts and plasma lactate has been shown to correlate with racing speed in thoroughbred horses and female cyclists
 <cit> .

lactic acidosis and oxidant stress may be causes of muscle fatigue
 <cit> . the mechanism by which reactive oxygen species cause muscle fatigue during intense exercise is not fully understood, however, supplementation with the antioxidant, n-acetylcysteine alleviates muscle fatigue in humans and animals
 <cit> . muscle fatigue due to oxidant stress may be a contributing factor to joint injuries, at least in humans
 <cit> . increasing lactate production by high intensity-contracting muscle will result in decreased ionized calcium release from the sarcolemma and contribute to muscle fatigue
 <cit> . muscle fatigue has been linked to increased bone strain in dogs experimentally, and may contribute to the development of stress fractures
 <cit> . further research is warranted to determine the muscle fiber types of elite agility competitors and whether, in competition, plasma lactate correlates with injury rates in these dogs.

platelets increased immediately following the agility exercise but by  <dig> hours later had returned to values similar to pre-exercise; and at all time-points, values were within reference range for the laboratory . in humans, increased platelet count occurs with intense exercise and are thought to be mobilized from the spleen, bone marrow and lungs, but they may also increase due to hemoconcentration from respiratory water loss as a result of panting
 <cit> . the small reduction in platelet counts following exercise may be due to plasma volume expansion that occurs during recovery or reduced catecholamine-induced platelet release
 <cit> .

similar to previous reports in agility dogs, increases in red blood cell count, hemoglobin and hematocrit occurred in all groups immediately following exercise
 <cit> . increases in these variables without a rise in total plasma protein is consistent with splenic contraction with similar findings reported in greyhounds after racing
 <cit> . rbc count, hct, and hemoglobin concentrations were decreased at 4-hours following the agility exercise test. in humans, during the hours following exercise, there is an increase in plasma volume termed “autohemodilution” resulting in decreased concentrations of rbc’s, hct and hemoglobin
 <cit> . this phenomenon may explain the decreased red blood cell parameters in the dogs reported here at 4-hours following exercise without alteration in protein or albumin concentrations as fluid from the interstitial space moves into the vascular space. to the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report indicating “autohemodilution” in dogs and further research is needed. plasma albumin concentration increased immediately after exercise  but remained within reference range and returned to pre-exercise values within  <dig> hours, table
 <dig>  no other alterations in hematological or biochemical parameters were found.

increased txb <dig> production without concomitant increase in prostaglandin e <dig> or pgf1α as reported here in agility dogs has also been reported in horses following treadmill exercise
 <cit> . in endurance exercise, horses may also increase 6-keto-prostaglandin f1α production, however this did not occur in the dogs of this study where the duration of exercise lasted less than  <dig> minutes
 <cit> . the dogs with the greatest skill level  had a significantly greater increase in txb <dig> and this association has also been reported in horses
 <cit> . high intensity exercise reportedly stimulates increased txb <dig> production whereas submaximal exercise induces increases in pgf1α rather than txb <dig> in humans
 <cit> . urinary 11-txb <dig> has been determined to be a reflection of in vivo platelet activation in humans
 <cit> . txb <dig> in urine includes renal production of thromboxane a <dig> and may not reflect systemic circulation or platelet production of the unstable prostaglandin, thromboxane a <dig> <cit> . in this study both txb <dig> and 11-txb <dig> increased following exercise and remained increased  <dig> hours post exercise indicating systemic increases in thromboxane a <dig> occurred in the dogs. interestingly, only txb <dig> was significantly increased when skill levels were examined and not 11-txb <dig> which may indicate greater renal production of thromboxane a <dig> only in the fastest dogs. potential sources of txb <dig> may include endothelial cells activated by shear stress or catecholamine activated platelets, however the source was not determined in this study. future research to determine why improved performance is associated with increased txb <dig> in the urine is warranted.

the dogs participating in the exercise test were not controlled for breed, age, sex, or nutritional status. restriction of these variables was not enforced since a very wide variety of dogs participate in agility sports and many of them go on to injure themselves in this exercise; therefore, we sought to ascertain the degree of physiological alteration that occurs in a variety of agility dogs. future research may limit the participants by breed etc. and investigate dogs during actual agility competition rather than a simulated test.

agility competition in dogs has become a popular sport with a high incidence of injury
 <cit> . development of methods to reduce increases in urinary txb <dig> and plasma lactate in elite canine athletes warrants investigation and determination of their effects on injury rates in dogs is a possible next step in this research. possible methods to reduce these alterations might include improved maintenance of hydration with readily accessible water during agility exercise, adequate warm-up and cool-down exercise prior to participation in any agility exercise to improve musculoskeletal blood flow, and training methods that increase aerobic muscle capacity. further understanding of the physiological responses to this type of intense, short-duration exercise may improve performance and reduce injury in dogs participating in this sport.
