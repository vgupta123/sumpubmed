BACKGROUND
circular dichroism  spectroscopy measures the differential absorbance of left- and right-handed circularly polarised light as it passes through a sample of chiral molecules. in the far ultraviolet  region of the electromagnetic spectrum, the electronic transitions of amide backbone groups dominate the cd spectra of proteins, with different types of secondary structures producing characteristic spectra. hence, the far uv cd data have been used for empirical determinations of protein secondary structure contents by employing the different reference dataset/algorithm combinations currently available  <cit> . a reference dataset consists of the cd spectra of a group of proteins, along with their corresponding secondary structure assignments derived from crystal structures. there are many methods of assigning protein secondary structures from crystallographic data including those based on cα coordinates  <cit>  or hydrogen bonding patterns only  <cit> , or in combination with phi and psi angles  <cit> . in addition, the xtlsstr algorithm  <cit>   was developed with the aim of being more relevant to spectroscopic measurements. currently, however, there is no consensus as to which of these secondary structure assignment methods correlates best with cd spectroscopic data.

the accuracy of an empirical analysis depends on the reference dataset containing representations of the types of structures present in the unknown protein  <cit> . whilst existing methods tend to produce excellent results for the helical content, they are generally not very accurate in defining β-sheet and β-turn structures, and for the most part do not break down the secondary structural types into several of the components that are now seen to be functionally important, namely polyproline ii  helixes,  <dig> helices and different types of turns.

synchrotron radiation circular dichroism  beamlines, which provide very bright light sources, can routinely enable the measurement of cd data to much lower wavelengths than can be achieved in conventional lab-based cd instruments  <cit> . recently a new larger and broader-based reference dataset containing the srcd spectra of proteins of known structure has been produced  <cit> . this contains the spectra of more than  <dig> proteins and has been designed for extensive coverage of both secondary structure and fold space. the components were chosen based on the cath classification of protein structures to include representatives of all major cath architectures and examples from each identified "superfamily" as well as to encompass the range of secondary structures present in all proteins found in the protein data bank. it also incorporates low wavelength  data  <cit> . electronic transitions in this wavelength range also includes information on protein secondary structure  <cit> , however, the existing algorithms used to calculate protein secondary structures from far uv cd data have not been designed to take optimal advantage of the additional information in the low wavelength data.

the availability of this new, significantly larger reference dataset has now provided the means by which to assess both existing and new algorithms as well as different secondary structure assignment schemes, and to examine the utility of the lower wavelength data for improving these analyses.

where fcd = fraction of secondary structure determined from cd data, fx = fraction of secondary structure calculated from the protein data bank  <cit>   structure, and n = number of cd spectra.

in addition to these values, it is useful to consider δ in relation to the population standard deviation of the experimentally determined secondary structure fractions of the reference dataset   <cit> .

the ratio of δ to σx  gives an indication of how much better a prediction method is than random . values of ζ less than  <dig>  indicate that the secondary structure prediction is worse than what would be obtained from random guesses. the ζ parameter thus flags instances where secondary structure content analyses are meaningless.

it is essential that any assessment of a dataset's predictive ability is carried out using a full cross-validation procedure. in this method the predictive performance is determined by sequentially removing a spectrum from the dataset and running the prediction method on that spectrum using the remaining spectra.

comparisons of algorithms
the accuracy prediction parameters were used to test and compare a number of algorithms, including several versions of selmat  <cit> , one of the currently available best methods for cd analyses, several popular chemometric methods, including partial least squares , simultaneous partial least squares  and principal component regression , as well as neural network  and support vector machine  techniques . the best results  produced by any of the algorithms for each secondary structure type are shown in bold in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> 

the  tag indicates that the cross-validation was carried out under more stringent  conditions such that no proteins in the training set with the same cath homologous superfamily as that of the test protein were included. the best results  for each secondary structure type with the sp <dig> and sp <dig> datasets are shown in bold.

the results shown are for the optimal number of principal components k·n is the proportion of residues in the reference dataset identified as having this type of secondary structure. those secondary structures with ζ values greater than  <dig>  are shown in bold.

the  tag indicates that the cross-validation was carried out under the more stringent conditions where no proteins in the training set with the same cath homologous superfamily as that of the test protein were included. the best results for each secondary structure type for the standard and non-redundant datasets are shown in bold.

the  tag indicates that the cross-validation was carried out under more stringent conditions where no proteins in the training or validation set with the same cath homologous superfamily as that of the test protein were included. the best results for each secondary structure type are shown in bold.

the secondary structure assignment scheme is the three-state α-helix , β-sheet  and other . the best results for each secondary structural type are highlighted in bold; they indicate that  <dig> neurons are marginally optimal overall for the sp <dig> dataset.

in the first instance, the most commonly cited secondary structure assignment method, the regular/distorted helix/sheet structure classification  <cit>  was used to assess the methods. the new sp <dig> dataset has been shown to give a good prediction accuracy  using this secondary structure assignment method  <cit>  with the selmat <dig> algorithm. improvements relative to selmat <dig> were seen for the αr, βr, turn, and 'other' fractions using the pls or pls-opt algorithms . furthermore, normalising the spectral data at each wavelength such that μ =  <dig> and σ =  <dig> before running selmat <dig>  resulted in improvements in most of the performance accuracies relative to selmat <dig>  selmat <dig> could not be used with the normalised data because the hennessey & johnson solution  <cit>  for the data scaled in this way was very poor. however, selmat <dig> and selmat1_norm both gave greater accuracy for the αd and βd fractions relative to either of the pls-based algorithms. but it should be noted that the αd and βd types were originally defined for use with the selmat3-type method.

the simpls and pcr algorithms could not be tested with the standard assignment scheme because six dependent variables exceeded the maximum that could be used with these algorithms with the sp <dig> data.

cross-validations were also carried out under more stringent  conditions such that no proteins in the training set from the same cath homologous superfamily as that of the test protein were included . these analyses showed little difference from those done with the dataset containing proteins from the same superfamily.

to summarise the results for the standard secondary structure assignment scheme, either of the pls methods or selmat1_norm work well and generally produced better results than the selmat <dig> algorithm.

alternative secondary structure assignments
an important issue with respect to the assignment scheme described above is that it is not easily reconciled with the definitions of secondary structures found in the crystallographically-derived assignments produced by the dssp algorithm  or those used by graphical packages for the display of protein structures, nor with the definitions used in sequence-based methods for prediction of secondary structures. hence correlation of cd data with an assignment scheme that more closely relates to these definitions could find significant utility in structural biology studies. another issue to be considered is which additional types of secondary structures could be quantitatively predicted from the sp <dig> dataset that have not been separately assigned by the existing scheme. as a result of both of these issues, in this study several other secondary structure assignment schemes were examined . analyses were done using the pls algorithm and choosing the best cross-validated result after varying the number of principal components  from  <dig> to  <dig>  the results show that β-turns ii and parallel β-sheet fractions have ζ values less than or equal to  <dig> , and even  <dig> helices have values near  <dig> , indicating that the predictions for these types of structures are little better than random. it is expected that the reason for this poor performance may be the small number of residues present in these conformations in the sp <dig> dataset  . the parallel β-sheet assignment has a much poorer performance than the case where the β-sheet assignment is not sub-divided, although the separate anti-parallel sheet assignment is reasonable and provided additional information content. filtering the dssp β-sheet to only include residues in the core β-sheet region of the ramachandran plot  <cit>  produced a slightly better result than did the βr definition. the pp-ii helical content, which has been shown to have important biological functions in a number of proteins, is reasonably well predicted.

in view of the above results a possible novel overall secondary structure assignment scheme of α-helix, βd, core β-sheet, pp-ii helix and other was tested. the results showed high secondary structure prediction accuracies . four of the five types of secondary structures have r >  <dig> , with even pp-ii helix having a reasonable r value of ~ <dig> . using this scheme, the pls, pcr and simpls methods perform similarly well and outperform the selmat <dig> method for all secondary structural types except the βd structures.

a simpler three-state secondary structure assignment scheme α-helix , β-sheet  and 'other'  , that has previously been shown to give good results for cd as well as ftir data  <cit>  was also tested. cross-validation of the sp <dig> reference datasets with this secondary structure assignment show very high prediction accuracies , with all of the  <dig> new methods giving better results for all structural types compared to selmat <dig> 

neural network  and support vector machine  methods
for neural network methods, the number of network weights must be kept to a minimum. hence only the three-state assignment scheme was used. the performance of the neural network trials undertaken with varying numbers of hidden layer nodes greater than  <dig> gave similar results , with  <dig> hidden nodes giving marginally the best overall performance. using the extra inputs to the neural network from the simpls helix and sheet predictions  improved their prediction accuracies further . the best nn performance was for the simpl-nn algorithms and, indeed, this produced the best overall results for the three-state model.

effect of low-wavelength cut-off
the effect of the low wavelength cut-off on the simpls, pls, pcr and selmat <dig> algorithms was assessed. simpls, pls and pcr algorithms gave similar results so only results from simpls are shown . if  <dig> principal components are used, the results for helical secondary structures are relatively insensitive to the low-wavelength cut-off as long as data to  <dig> nm is included. when the low-wavelength cut-off is above ~ <dig> nm there is a massive drop in the prediction accuracies. for β-sheet determinations, there is a slow but significant decrease in performance over the region from  <dig> to  <dig> nm, suggesting the availability of the low wavelength data may be more important for accurate analyses of β-sheets, a type of secondary structure not particularly well-analyzed with only far uv data. none of the alternative values of k for the algorithms are able to prevent the drop in performance in this region so the effect is not due to including either an excessive or inadequate number of principal components. hence it would appear that for general use of the simpls algorithm, k =  <dig> is the optimal value for the sp <dig> dataset. for  <dig> helices, there is little difference in the accuracy with the inclusion of the low wavelength data , however, for pp-ii helices, the accuracy is, like β-sheets, slightly improved as more low wavelength data is included.

these modest wavelength cut-off results are somewhat surprising given that the peptide backbone produces a number of electronic transitions below  <dig> nm. this suggests that perhaps the magnitudes of the peaks at wavelengths higher than  <dig> nm dominate the analyses. to test this, the spectral shapes were left unchanged but scale factors of different magnitudes were applied to change the spectral magnitudes and the analyses were repeated. this was done because an important practical consideration in analyses of cd spectra is the correctness of the spectral magnitude. significant errors in magnitude can arise from inaccurate determinations of protein concentration or optical cell pathlength  <cit> . to understand the effects of these errors on the accuracy, analyses as a function of low wavelength cut-off were undertaken. the results  show that for the α-helix secondary structure the cross-validated performance of the correctly scaled sp <dig> dataset was similar to that of the sp <dig> dataset with a small scaling error added  for all the low wavelength cutoff values used. however, as progressively greater magnitude scale factors were applied, the cross-validated performance accuracy became more dependent on the low-wavelength cut-off value. for instance, when errors on the order of only 10% are present, the improvement in accuracy with the addition of low wavelength data is quite dramatic: the value of r increases from  <dig>  to  <dig> . this suggests that the lack of correlation of low-wavelength data cut-off with cross-validated performance of the sp <dig> dataset can be partly attributed to the high accuracy of the concentration and pathlength determinations in the component spectra of the dataset. it also indicates that when the sp <dig> dataset is used for analyses of other proteins, the low wavelength data will provide some robustness against magnitude error.

CONCLUSIONS
we have described several novel algorithms, including support vector machine and neural network methodologies, that produced higher accuracies for secondary structure determination than those currently in use for cd analyses. the selmat algorithms remain the best for predicting the αd and βd secondary structures, but these classifications are not easily correlated with standard secondary structure categories.

we have shown which structures can and cannot be quantitatively determined from the cd spectra of the new larger and broader-based sp <dig> dataset . excluding non-core β-sheet residues from the β-sheet fraction makes sense in view of the large variety of dihedral angles assigned as β-sheet by the dssp algorithm. this method improves the general prediction of the remaining secondary structures. a simple 3-state prediction of α-helix , β-sheet  and 'other'  has been shown to give very good quantitative prediction for all fractions . with this method α-helix  and β-sheet  have values of r as high as  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the alternative three-state assignment scheme discussed here mimics the types of secondary structures described for crystal structures and identified by graphics programs and sequence/secondary structure prediction programs more closely than some of the more obscure assignment methods often used for cd data analyses. it is anticipated that this will be a robust method since proteins with high  <dig> helix  and β-bridge  content will not necessarily have an α-helical or β-sheet type spectrum because of length effects. also this secondary structure assignment method can be easily applied in conjunction with three-state sequence prediction methods using a compatible secondary structure assignment algorithm such as the sspro <dig> server  <cit> . the alternative secondary structure assignments of α-helix , β-sheet  and 'other'  would need to be used with some commonly-used sequence-based structure prediction methods  <cit> . we would expect the h, e, o assignment to be better in cases where proteins have large amounts of g relative to h, or large amounts of b relative to e since length effects will be important in these instances. it should be noted, however, that the sp <dig> dataset is particularly lacking in proteins with significant disorder , so these types of structures have not been separated out from "other" components in this study.

in order to examine the effect of spectral redundancy in the reference dataset, the accuracies of the methods were tested with redundant and non-redundant versions of the reference dataset. in this study, there was little degradation of either the analysis quality associated with removal of these data from the reference dataset nor was there a change in the ordering of which method works best. hence, the improvements described do not arise from the algorithms exploiting structural redundancy in the dataset. however, the results do suggest that in the future the most valuable additions to the reference dataset will be from proteins with unique structures.

all of the methods implemented in this paper, with the exception of selmat, are only capable of mapping linear relationships in the data. the neural network and svr methods used linear transfer/kernel functions, respectively. as the sp <dig> reference dataset is expanded in the future by supplementation with additional spectra, it may be possible to use non-linear versions of the svr  and nn  which are more demanding of input data to allow mapping of non-linear relationships.

paradoxically, an important result emerges in the sharp cut-off of prediction accuracy observed when the broadly-based dataset is truncated to a low-wavelength cut-off at ~ <dig> nm. with srcd it is possible to collect data to ≤  <dig> nm in almost any solvent and buffer commonly used in biological studies, including  <dig> m guanidine hydrochloride and urea. thus, these methods should provide especially good improvements for assessing secondary structure in protein folding and unfolding studies.

a final, and very significant result, which will find practical application in cd analyses, is that when accurate information on protein concentration is unavailable , the inclusion of the low wavelength vuv data will produce much better analyses than if only the far uv data is used.

in conclusion, the simpls and pls methods appear to work consistently amongst the best methods with all of the secondary structure assignment schemes tested. for the three-state  scheme, the more complicated simpl-nn produced the best overall results. however, due to its much greater simplicity, the simpls method should be preferred over the simpl-nn method until a larger cd reference dataset is available.
