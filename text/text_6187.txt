BACKGROUND
tetraspanins are a superfamily of small integral membrane proteins that were first identified in mammals as cell-specific antigens  <cit>  and, since then, in fishes, insects, worms, sponges  <cit>  and fungi  <cit> . they are not found in plants, although tetraspanin-like proteins were identified in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . to date, at least  <dig> distinct tetraspanins have been identified in humans,  <dig> in drosophila melanogaster and  <dig> in caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . animal tetraspanins interact tightly and specifically with other membrane proteins and have been proposed to act as molecular facilitators of membrane protein complexes  <cit> . animal tetraspanins are also able to interact with other tetraspanins to form a scaffold that promotes the recruitment of tetraspanin-associated proteins, hence creating a web  <cit> . as a consequence of this complexity, tetraspanin webs from different cell types differ markedly in their protein composition and probably also in their cellular function. this may explain the diversity of phenotypes observed among tetraspanin knockout mutants in animals. indeed, tetraspanin null mutants are altered in diverse unrelated processes such as sperm-egg fusion, susceptibility to parasites or viruses, neuronal or lymphocyte cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion, motility and polarity and protein trafficking  <cit> .

although tetraspanins display limited amino acid sequence similarity, they share conserved structural hallmarks consisting of four transmembrane domains , a small extracellular loop , an intracellular loop  and a large extracellular loop  containing a characteristic cysteine-based pattern  <cit> . in fungi, the first tetraspanin identified was in the plant pathogenic fungus m. grisea and was named pls <dig> . since then, genes homologous to pls <dig> have been identified in other ascomycetes  <cit>  and basidiomycetes  <cit> . the functional role of pls <dig> in the fungal cell has been investigated in three plant pathogenic ascomycetes  <cit> , namely m. grisea , botrytis cinerea  and colletotrichum lindemuthianum . these fungi are responsible for major diseases of agriculturally important plants, m. grisea causing the most devastating fungal disease of rice  worldwide, b. cinerea being a necrotrophic pathogen affecting more than  <dig> different host plants and c. lindemuthianum causing anthracnose diseases on a wide range of crops and ornamental plants. during the infection process, these fungi differentiate a specialized cell called the appressorium that is able to perforate the plant cuticle and cell wall, allowing the fungus to penetrate into host tissues. the Δmgpls <dig>  Δbcpls <dig> and Δclpls <dig> null mutants were all non-pathogenic on intact host plant tissues. although the mutants could differentiate appressoria, these infection structures were unable to direct the penetration of the fungus into host plant tissues  <cit> . these results demonstrate that pls <dig> tetraspanins are involved in a function conserved among fungi that is essential for appressorium-mediated penetration.

previous studies suggested that fungal genomes possess a single tetraspanin gene  <cit> . however, analysis of recently sequenced fungal genomes revealed that besides pls <dig> orthologs, basidiomycetes have other tetraspanins called tsp <dig>  <cit> . this prompted us to systematically search for novel tetraspanins in fungal genomes and est databases to better characterize this protein family in fungi. using low stringency blastp and hmm  searches using the pfam tetraspanin profile , we identified a novel tetraspanin  and a tetraspanin-like protein  in m. grisea and their orthologs in other ascomycetes. furthermore, genes from the tsp <dig> family were identified in newly available basidiomycete genomes and they displayed a complex evolutionary history with numerous paralogs. the expression profiles of pls <dig>  tsp <dig>  tsp <dig> and tpl <dig> were determined by quantitative rt-pcr in m. grisea or by microarray analysisin the symbiotic l. bicolor. expression of these genes was also estimated in silico by compiling their occurrence in est or cdna libraries. finally, a functional study of tsp <dig> and tpl <dig> was performed in m. grisea, whereby deletion mutants were constructed by targeted gene replacement and compared to the existing Δpls <dig> mutant. in marked contrast to this latter mutant, which was fully non-pathogenic on barley and rice, the Δtsp <dig> and Δtpl <dig> mutants were reduced in pathogenicity only on rice. thus deletion of these genes has a host-specific effect on the pathogenicity of m. grisea which is different from that of the pls <dig> deletion.

RESULTS
pls <dig> tetraspanins are widespread in ascomycetes and basidiomycetes
proteins homologous to pls <dig>  and  were identified using blastp in all available sequenced genomes of ascomycetes  and basidiomycetes , except ustilago maydis, cryptoccocus neoformans, aspergillus species, mycosphaerella graminicola, and all saccharomycotina species . another strategy based on the use of the tetraspanin hmm profile  revealed a single pls <dig> tetraspanin in the same fungal genomes. sspls <dig>  lmpls <dig>  papls <dig>  gzpls <dig>  cppls <dig> cdnas were obtained either from cdna libraries or reconstructed from ests and used to define introns and start and stop codons in the corresponding genes.

the sequence conservation between the different pls <dig> tetraspanins is essentially in the tm domains, some regions of the ecl <dig> including its cysteine-based pattern -c-x-c-x-tm4) and the c-terminal tail . the ecl <dig> sequences are more variable, as those in basidiomycete pls <dig> proteins  are shorter than in ascomycetes . similarly, the conserved motif in icl from pls <dig> proteins of basidiomycetes  is very different from that found in pls <dig> from ascomycetes . three tm domains contain charged/polar amino acids  conserved among all pls <dig> proteins. some pls <dig> proteins from ascomycetes have additional charged/polar amino acids . in animal tetraspanins, these conserved polar/charged amino acids are thought to stabilize interactions between transmembrane domains  <cit> . a putative palmitoylation site  is located at the end of tm <dig> in most pls <dig> tetraspanins, except those from the leotiomycetes, botrytis cinerea and sclerotinia sclerotiorum . in animals, the palmitoylation of several conserved juxtamembrane cysteine residues influences the formation of tetraspanin-enriched membrane microdomains  <cit> . a variable region is located in the ecl <dig> loop of fungal pls <dig> tetraspanins , between the last two cysteine residues whereas, it is located between the second and the last cysteine residues of the ecl <dig> in animal tetraspanins. interestingly, in animals this variable region contains sites involved in specific tetraspanin protein-protein interactions  <cit> . the cysteine-based pattern of fungal pls <dig> tetraspanins -c-x-c-x-tm4) contains a conserved tyrosine residue located after the ccg motif that is not in the cysteine-based pattern of animal tetraspanins . the cysteine-based pattern of ascomycete pls <dig> ec <dig> -c-x-gc-x-tm4) is slightly different from that found in pls <dig> from basidiomycetes -c-x-c-x-tm <dig>   and ) suggesting their ecl <dig> tertiary structure slightly differs from those of ascomycetes. the amino acid sequences of the c-terminal tail of fungal pls <dig> tetraspanins are strongly conserved and are rich in charged/polar amino acids . indeed, these c-terminal tails display a conserved rxexerf/yxxidxk motif found in pls <dig> from ascomycetes as well as from basidiomycetes . this conservation suggests that the c-terminal tail of fungal pls <dig> tetraspanins plays a functional role as does that of animal tetraspanins  <cit> .

tsp <dig> tetraspanins are restricted to basidiomycetes
prior to this study, the first set of tsp <dig> tetraspanins was identified in basidiomycetes such as coprinus cinereus , phanerochaete chrysosporium  and cryptococcus neoformans . tsp <dig> proteins display a long n-terminal tail  and a long c-terminal cytoplasmic tail . these domain lengths are characteristic of the tsp <dig> family as pls <dig> tetraspanins contain only short n-terminal and c-terminal tails . furthermore, the c-terminal tails of tsp <dig> proteins are not as rich in charged amino acids  as those of pls <dig> proteins . we identified four homologues of tsp <dig>  in the basidiomycete l. bicolor. the correspondingcdnas reconstructed from ests were used to define introns and start/stop codons in the corresponding genes. this family displays all the structural hallmarks of tetraspanin secondary structure with four transmembrane domains, a small extracellular loop , a small intracellular loop , a large extracellular loop  with a typical cysteine-based pattern -cy/f-x-gck-x-tm4) and a conserved c-terminal cytoplasmic tail . three tm domains contain one or two conserved charged/polar amino acids  as observed for animal and fungal pls <dig> tetraspanins  <cit> . one putative conserved palmitoylation site  is located at the end of tm <dig>  proximal to the inner side of the membrane according to the predicted fungal tetraspanin topology. additionally, lbtsp2a and pctsp <dig> display another putative palmitoylation site  at the start of tm <dig>  proximal to the inner side of the membrane. we were not able to identify proteins orthologous to tsp <dig> in ascomycetes using blast analysis or the tetraspanin hmm profile.

tsp <dig> is a novel tetraspanin family specific to ascomycetes
we identified a novel tetraspanin in m. grisea which we named mgtsp <dig>  using the tetraspanin hmm profile . mgtsp <dig> is a modified version of mgg_ <dig>  and annotation errors were corrected using the tsp <dig> cdna sequence. this novel tetraspanin displays the structural hallmarks of tetraspanins including a characteristic cysteine-based pattern -c-x-c-x-tm4) and a c-terminal tail containing a high proportion of polar/charged amino acids . however, it differs from pls <dig> of ascomycetes in the following features: a lack of charged/polar amino acid in tm domains, a smaller ecl <dig> , a longer icl  and a longer c-terminal tail  similar in size to that of tsp <dig> proteins from basidiomycetes .

proteins homologous to tsp <dig> were detected only in ascomycetes, including p. anserina, t. reesei, n. crassa, c. globosum, g. zeae, s. nodorum, b. cinerea, s. sclerotiorum and uncinocarpus reesii . a tsp <dig> homologue was identified in aspergillus niger, this being the first report of an aspergillus tetraspanin . in marked contrast, the tsp <dig> protein is absent from basidiomycete genomes. the amplification of mgtsp <dig> cdna obtained by rt-pcr allowed the identification of three introns at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp. other tsp <dig> genes were aligned to ests when available , allowing prediction of their exon positions and their corresponding proteins in n. crassa and s. sclerotiorum. the number of introns varies between one and four in the sordariaceae, with a conserved intron at position  <dig> bp from the start codon . tsp <dig> genes from leotiomycetes  have four introns at conserved positions . sntsp <dig> and trtsp <dig> did notdisplay four transmembrane domains; however, this is probably due to a sequence gap and an incorrect intron annotation, respectively. for this reason, these genes were not included in the comparative analysis. overall tsp <dig> sequences are not as conserved as pls <dig> and tsp <dig> proteins from the same range of species . in particular, icl and c-terminal tail are not conserved, unlike that in pls <dig> proteins .

tpl <dig> is a tetraspanin-like protein restricted to ascomycetes
in addition to the tetraspanins described above, the m. grisea genomecontains a tetraspanin-like gene, which we have named tpl <dig> . this gene was identified by use of the tetraspanin hmm profile  not only in m. grisea but also in other ascomycetes such as c. globosum, s. nodorum, n. crassa, p. anserina and a. nidulans . in marked contrast, the tpl <dig> protein is absent from basidiomycete genomes. the mgtpl <dig> cdna was reconstructed from ests and used to define introns and start/stop codons. mgtpl <dig> has two introns at position  <dig> and  <dig> bp from atg . tpl <dig> proteins display some structural hallmarks of tetraspanins such as the presence of four transmembrane domains, a small ecl <dig> loop , a short icl loop , a large ecl <dig> loop  and a c-terminal cytoplasmic tail  similar in size to that of pls <dig> tetraspanins . however, tpl <dig> proteins markedly differ from pls <dig>  tsp <dig> and tsp <dig> tetraspanins in that they lack the typical cysteine based-pattern in the ecl <dig>  instead, they have two conserved cysteine residues close to the tm <dig> and tm <dig>  respectively . for this reason, we have classified these proteins as tetraspanin-like.

phylogeny of fungal tetraspanins reveals paralogs only in the tsp <dig> family
protein sequences from pls <dig>  tsp <dig> and tsp <dig> families were aligned using clustalx  <dig>  . a phylogenetic analysis was then conducted using the phyml software. the tpl <dig> tetraspanin-like family was excluded from this alignment as these proteins are too divergent from pls <dig>  tsp <dig> and tsp <dig> proteins to be aligned correctly. the resulting phylogenetic tree  shows that pls <dig>  tsp <dig> and tsp <dig> form three distinct families. this phylogenetic tree also shows that the pls <dig> genes from ascomycetes and basidiomycetes are orthologs, as the tree is congruent to the corresponding species phylogeny  <cit> . similarly, tsp <dig> genes are orthologs . the tsp <dig> family consists of numerous paralogs, some being recent as their closest relative gene is in the same species . the tsp <dig> cluster is rooted by tetraspanins in the zygomycete, r. oryzae . the presence of tetraspanins in r. oryzae shows that this family of tetraspanins is ancient and predates the split between zygomycetes and higher fungi.

the number of introns in pls <dig> genes varies from one to three in ascomycetes and from three to four in basidiomycetes . one intron position is conserved in all pls <dig> genes from ascomycetes  except in the related bcpls <dig> and sspls <dig> . this intron conservation supports the orthology found between pls <dig> genes from ascomycetes. in pls <dig> from basidiomycetes, three of the four intron positions are conserved  confirming a common origin for these three genes. the number of introns in genes from the tsp <dig> family varies from zero to four. however closely related tsp <dig> genes such as cctsp2a, cctsp2b, lbtsp2b and lbtsp2d  that cluster as a single clade in the phylogenetic tree  share the  <dig> among three introns, suggesting that they result from recent duplications in both c. cinereus and l. bicolor genomes. in sordariaceae, tsp <dig> genes contain three introns  except n. crassa which has four, although this may be due to an incorrect exon/intron annotation in the n. crassa gene that could not been corrected since it has no ests. other tsp <dig> genes have three conserved intron positions  except in the related bcpls <dig> and sspls <dig> , which have an additional specific intron. this conservation of intron number and position supports the orthology between tsp <dig> genes.

expression of fungal genes encoding tetraspanins
the expression patterns of pls <dig>  tsp <dig>  tsp <dig> and tpl <dig> were evaluated in different fungal species in silico , and by quantitative pcr in m. grisea for mgpls <dig>  mgtsp <dig> and mgtpl <dig>  or by microarrays in l. bicolor for lbpls <dig>  lbtsp2-a, lbtsp2-b, lbtsp2-c and lbtsp2-d .

ests corresponding to genes from the pls <dig> family were identified  in m. grisea , t. reesei,b. cinerea , s. sclerotiorium , gibberella moniliformis , p. anserina ,c. cinerea , p. chrysosporium  and l. bicolor . in all these fungi pls <dig> genes are expressed, ruling out the possibility that they correspond to pseudogenes. indeed pls <dig> cdnas of l. maculans, s. sclerotiorium and c. posadasii were obtained by the screening cdna libraries. qpcr expression profiling in m. grisea revealed that mgpls <dig> mrnais expressed at similar levels in mycelia and perithecia  and in spores, appressoria and infected barley leaves . in l. bicolor, pls <dig> is constitutively expressed in all tissues analyzed .

the expression patterns of the different tsp <dig> genes in l. bicolor were determined using genome wide long oligonucleotide microarrays . lbtsp2-a shows a barely detectable expression level in contrast to lbtsp2-b, lbtsp2-c and lbtsp2-d, which are expressed in all tissues of l. bicolor. lbtsp2-b is highly expressed in mycorrhiza and mycelia and at a lower level in fruiting bodies. transcripts corresponding to lbtsp2-c are mainly found in fruiting bodies, whereas lbtsp2-d is over-expressed in mycorrhiza . ests corresponding to tsp <dig> were found in p. chrysosporium, c. neoformans, c. cinerea  and l. bicolor  suggesting that these genes are expressed in the corresponding species.

ests corresponding to tsp <dig> were identified in g. zeae , t. reesei , trichoderma harzianum , b. cinerea , s. sclerotiorium  and a. niger . quantitative pcr expression profiling in m. grisea showed that mgtsp <dig> is only weakly expressed in perithecia  and mycelia , and negligible in spore and appressoria . spliced tsp <dig> transcripts were detected by rt-pcr using mycelial rna  suggesting that tsp <dig> is indeed expressed in mycelia, although at a very low level.

ests for tpl <dig> were only identified in m. grisea and p. anserina . quantitative pcr expression profiling in m. grisea revealed that mgtpl <dig> is over-expressed in perithecia and mycelia , but its expression is not detected in spores and appressoria .

functional analysis of tsp <dig> and tpl <dig> in m. grisea
the m. grisea deletion mutants of tsp <dig> and tpl <dig> were obtained by targeted gene replacement in a p <dig> -Δku80::bar mutant background that increases the frequency of homologous recombination  <cit> . fifteen and  <dig> hygromycin-resistant transformants of tsp <dig> and tpl <dig>  respectively, were isolated andanalyzed by pcr for the replacement of their wild-type alleles. deletion mutants were obtained with an efficiency of 100%  and 82%  for tsp <dig> and tpl <dig>  respectively. their mycelial growth and sporulation rates were similar to those of p <dig> -Δku80::bar . these mutants were inoculated on detached barley leaves using droplets of conidial suspensions or on barley plants by spraying. mutants Δtsp3::hyg or Δtpl1::hyg caused foliar lesions identical in number, size and aspect to those induced by the reference strain p <dig> -Δku80::bar. the penetration frequencies of thesemutants on barley epidermis were similar to those of wild type, suggesting that tsp <dig> and tpl <dig> are not involved in pathogenicity on barley . this behavior differs from Δpls <dig> mutant which is non-pathogenic on barley  <cit> . these mutants were spray-inoculated on two different rice cultivars compatible with m. grisea isolate p <dig> , azucena  with an intermediate level of partial resistance to m. grisea and co- <dig>  that is more susceptible to m. grisea than azucena. quantitative analysis of leaf blast infection revealed that the pathogenicity of Δtsp3::hyg and Δtpl1::hyg deletion mutants is significantly reduced on both cultivars. on cv. azucena, the Δtsp3::hyg and Δtpl1::hyg mutants produced respectively less than 30%  and 35%  of the number of foliar lesions induced by the p <dig> -Δku80::bar reference strain . on cv. co- <dig>  the Δtsp3::hyg and Δtpl1::hyg mutants produced respectively less than 55%  and 40% , respectively, of the number of foliar lesions produced by the p <dig> -Δku80::bar strain .

the up-regulation of tsp <dig> and tpl <dig> in perithecia suggested involvement of these genes in mating. to address this question, the differentiation of perithecia and ascospores was examined in crosses between wild-type th <dig> isolate and Δtsp3::hyg or Δtpl1::hyg mutants. a cross between the p <dig> -Δku80::bar mutant  and wild-type th <dig> isolate was used as control. production of perithecia was monitored and three weeks after mating and those ascospores were observed and then allowed to germinate. no significant differences were observed in the fertility in crosses between Δtsp3::hyg, Δtpl1::hyg and wild type m. grisea strains, indicating that these genes are not essential for sexual reproduction.

discussion
we have performed an exhaustive search for tetraspanins in fungal genomes. in addition to expanding the previously described pls <dig>  <cit>  and tsp <dig> tetraspanin families  <cit> , we have identified a new tetraspanin family  and a tetraspanin-like family . these gene families display a different evolutionary history. an ancestral tetraspanin family specific to zygomycetes  appears to be lost in higher fungi . the identification of a tsp <dig> tetraspanin in the zygomycete rhizopus oryzae  shows that this family is ancient and predates the divergence between this phylum and higher fungi. pls1-encoding genes were identified in almost all ascomycete and basidiomycete species. their absence in zygomycetes suggests that the pls <dig> family is more recent than the tsp <dig> one . the tsp <dig> and tpl <dig> families are restricted to ascomycetes suggesting a more recent origin than the pls <dig> and tsp <dig> families. the absence of tetraspanins in all hemiascomycete species suggests that these genes were lost early after the divergence of these fungi from the other ascomycetes. in the aspergilli, the unique tetraspanin identified belongs to the tsp <dig> family. interestingly no tetraspanin genes were found in the basidiomycete, u. maydis.

the pls <dig> family is highly conserved in higher fungi and is present as a single copy in each genome, defining a family of orthologous genes. in phytopathogenic fungi, pls <dig> is essential for infection and is required for appressorium-mediated penetration into host plant in three species . the corresponding null mutants have appressoria that are unable to form functional penetration pegs that direct the penetration of the fungus into host plant  <cit> . these results support the hypothesis that pls <dig> tetraspanins are involved in a conserved cellular function essential for appressorium function. however, the existence of pls <dig> in the human ascomycete pathogen coccidioides posadasii, in saprotrophic fungiand in symbiotic basidiomycetes such as ectomycorrhiza suggests that pls <dig> plays other cellular roles than appressorium-mediated penetration of host tissues since these fungi do not differentiate appressoria. at present, these functions of pls <dig> remain unknown. in fungi, functional studies are just beginning to be applied to discover such functions. furthermore, the presence of a single copy of pls <dig> in these fungal genomes offers an advantage in deciphering its cellular functions, compared to animals that have numerous tetraspanins with possible functional redundancy  <cit> .

the tsp <dig> tetraspanins are highly conserved suggesting an important functional role in most basidiomycetes although it is curious that the ustilago maydis genome does not contain tetraspanins. interestingly, this tsp <dig> family is multigenic in l. bicolor and c. cinerea, which contrasts with other fungal tetraspanins families. indeed, l. bicolor displays four tsp <dig> paralogs and c. cinerea contains three tsp <dig> paralogs. the functional significance of this multigene family is unknown. the finding in l. bicolor that lbtsp2b, lbtsp2c and lbtsp2d were expressed in all analyzed tissues suggests that corresponding proteins could be involved in the formation of a tetraspanin web, as described in animals  <cit> . however, differential expression profiles were observed; lbtsp2b is over-expressed in mycelia, lbtsp2c is over-expressed in fruiting bodies and lbtsp2d is over-expressed in mycorrhiza. this tissue specific expression of tsp <dig> tetraspanins may explain the redundancy of this family.

although tsp <dig> and tpl <dig> are over-expressed in perithecia, no particular phenotype was observed in perithecia when either of these genes was mutated. perithecial production after mating and ascospore germination were identical to the wild type strain. no significant differences in the fertility were observed in crosses between Δtsp3::hyg, Δtpl1::hyg and wild type m. grisea strains. in animals, analysis of mutants with deleted tetraspanins showed no effect on development, but often had slightly altered phenotypes. for example, deletions of murine tetraspanin genes led to a mild alteration of lymphocyte proliferation and motility  <cit> . even, in the drosophilae the deletion of about 25% of all tetraspanins does not affect viability or fertility and results only in a transient defect in neuromuscular innervation during the larval stage  <cit> . m. grisea may not be an appropriate model to characterize sexual reproduction and anastomosis. therefore, it would be interesting to investigate the role of the tsp <dig> and tpl <dig> genes in other 'model' fungi such as n. crassa or p. anserina, which have large sexual fruiting bodies and higher reproduction frequency, and thus may be more suitable to analyze subtle phenotypes.

in m. grisea, the Δtsp <dig> and Δtpl <dig> mutants showed a significant reduction in pathogenicity only on rice. the rice cultivars used in this study are generally more resistant to m. grisea compared to the barley cultivars. thus, barley may not be resistant enough to reveal differences in pathogenicity between the Δtsp <dig> and Δtpl <dig> mutants and a wild type strain. our findings show that tsp <dig> and tpl <dig> are involved in the pathogenicity of m. grisea but have only a quantitative effect on pathogenicity, in contrast to the loss of pathogenicity caused by deletion of pls <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
higher fungi contain three canonical tetraspanin families: the pls <dig> family identified in ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, the tsp <dig> family specific to basidiomycetes and the tsp <dig> family restricted to ascomycetes. paralogs were only identified within the tsp <dig> family in the basidiomycetes c. cinereus and l. bicolor. a tetraspanin-like family  was also identified although only in ascomycetes. our results demonstrate that the deletion of tsp <dig> and tpl <dig> reduced the pathogenicity of m. grisea on rice. at present, functional studies of fungal tetraspanins are limited to phytopathogenic fungi producing appressoria. the function of tetraspanin remain unknown in saprophytic fungi, basidiomycetes and human pathogenic fungi. future functional study of tetraspanins in these fungi may highlight other cellular roles than in appressorium-mediated penetration in host plants. finally, the role of tetraspanin-like proteins in fungi needs to be investigated in more depth. for example, the possibility of functional interactions with canonical tetraspanins should be assessed as observed in animals  <cit> .
