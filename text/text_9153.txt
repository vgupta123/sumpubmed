BACKGROUND
estrogen receptor α , a member of the nuclear receptor  superfamily of transcription factors, plays a crucial role in the control of epithelial cell proliferation and mammary gland development  <cit>  as well as in the development and progression of breast cancer  <cit> . classically, erα is activated by estrogen binding, and this leads to receptor phosphorylation, dimerization, and to recruitment of coactivators to the estrogen-bound receptor complex  <cit> . oncogenesis in breast cancer frequently involves excessive activation of the erα signaling due primarily to overexpression of erα and/or its coactivators  <cit> . factors that affect the balance of erα and its cofactors in breast cancer cells can modulate erα signaling and thereby alter the cell growth response to estrogen stimulation. human mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells express functional erα and display estrogen-dependent growth, and have been widely used as an in vitro model for studying the regulatory mechanisms of erα action in estrogen-dependent breast cancer  <cit> .

most coactivator proteins contain different activation domains or enzyme activity modules that include classical histone acetylase, bromo, chromo, su 3- <dig>  enhancer of zeste, trithorax and atpase domains, by which coactivators facilitate the assembly of the transcription initiation complex through their chromatin remodeling activities  <cit> . lrp <dig> is a member of the macro domain superfamily with a simple structure compared to other members because it contains only a single stand-alone macro module in its c-terminal region  <cit> . lrp <dig> was previously identified as a target gene for both erα and the androgen receptor   <cit> . the proximal region  of the human lrp <dig> promoter contains a 1/ <dig> ere/sp <dig> site and multiple gc-rich elements that confer estrogen responsiveness and is sufficient for estrogen action  <cit> . lrp <dig> protein interacts with both erα and ar and enhances their transcriptional activities in a ligand-dependent manner, thus establishing a positive feedback regulatory loop between lrp <dig> and erα/ar signal transduction  <cit> . in addition, lrp <dig> has also been reported to act as a potential coactivator that amplifies the transactivation of  <dig> other nrs  <cit> . overexpression of lrp <dig> can stimulate the proliferation of mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells by enhancing estrogen-stimulated transcription mediated by erα  <cit> . inhibition of lrp <dig> gene expression significantly suppresses the proliferative activity and invasiveness of estrogen-responsive epithelial cancer cells  <cit> . consistent with findings in cell culture, a positive correlation was found between lrp <dig> mrna levels and the progression of primary breast cancers  <cit> . although the mechanisms of estrogen regulation of lrp <dig> expression and the functional role of lrp <dig> in erα-mediated transcriptional regulation are relatively well characterized, the regulation of the functional availability of this coactivator protein is unclear.

the cytoskeleton of epithelial cells is predominantly formed by intermediate filament protein keratins  that are subclassified into type i  and type ii  families  <cit> . k <dig>  is expressed in single-layer epithelial cells of the human body and is localized in the cytoplasm and perinuclear region. in the normal mammary epithelium, k <dig> is expressed in the luminal cells that represent the differentiation compartment  <cit> . k <dig> has been recognized for many years as an epithelial marker in diagnostic histopathology  <cit> . the level of k <dig> expression has been inversely associated with the progression of breast cancer: 25% to 80% of all breast carcinomas exhibit loss of k <dig> expression and this is associated with significantly poorer prognosis  <cit> . transfection of k <dig> into erα-negative mda-mb- <dig> breast cancer cells caused significant reduction of malignancy both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . results from cell-culture experiments and clinicopathological parameter analyses have also revealed a relationship between decreased amounts of k <dig> in the cytoplasm and increased proliferative activity of breast cancer cells  <cit> . these previous studies suggest that k <dig> plays an important role in tumor progression in breast cancer patients, but the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood.

in the present study we first used the yeast two-hybrid system to investigate proteins interacting with lrp <dig>  this revealed that k <dig> physically interacts with lrp <dig> through its c-terminal region. moreover, k <dig> binding sequesters lrp <dig> in the cytoplasm and prevents its enhancement of erα-mediated transcription in mcf- <dig> cells. using estrogen-responsive mcf- <dig> cells as a model we have demonstrated that k <dig> modulates both estrogen activation of erα target genes and cell cycle progression. these results suggest that loss of k <dig> expression in erα-positive breast cells, and failure of cytoplasmic sequestration of the erα coactivator lrp <dig>  may contribute to tumor proliferation by increasing erα signaling in the nucleus.

RESULTS
k <dig> is a novel interactor of lrp16
the yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen for new polypeptides interacting with lrp <dig>  sequences from a mcf- <dig> breast cancer cell cdna library were screened for binding to lrp16; this identified nine clones corresponding to  <dig> different potential lrp16-binding proteins. one such cdna clone was found to contain a full-length coding sequence  for the cytokeratin k <dig>  the specificity of the interaction between lrp <dig> and k <dig> was demonstrated by chromogenic assay using x-gal; no staining developed using either factor alone or in pairwise controls containing only the gal <dig> activation domain  or the gal <dig> dna binding domain  .

to confirm the specificity of the interaction between k <dig> and lrp <dig> we analyzed glutathione s-transferase  fusion proteins and in vitro-translated proteins by pulldown assays. gst-lrp <dig> efficiently bound to in vitro-translated 35s-labeled full-length k <dig> . a series of k <dig> deletion constructs were then used in gst pull-down assays to identify the region within k <dig> that is required for lrp <dig> binding. gst-lrp <dig> failed to bind to either k18-n  or k18-f  but bound strongly to both k18-c <dig>  and k18-c <dig>  . we then tested n- and c-terminal lrp <dig> deletion constructs for k <dig> binding. full-length k <dig> polypeptide bound strongly to gst-lrp16-c  but only weakly to gst-lrp16-n ; k <dig> failed to bind to gst alone . together these results indicate that the interaction between k <dig> and lrp <dig> is mediated primarily by the c-terminal region of k <dig> and the single macro domain of lrp <dig> 

we then used co-immunoprecipitation  to confirm that k <dig> interacts with lrp <dig> in mammalian cells. a pcdna <dig>  expression vector directing the expression of lrp <dig>  was transfected into mcf- <dig> cells; cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against either k <dig> or lrp <dig>  precipitates were resolved by gel electrophoresis and probed with antibody against lrp <dig>  the empty pcdna <dig>  expression vector provided a negative control. an intense band corresponding to lrp <dig> was detected in anti-k <dig> antibody immunoprecipitates from lrp16-overexpressing mcf- <dig> cells . in addition, a weak band corresponding to endogenous lrp <dig> was detected in anti-k <dig> immunoprecipitates from vector-transfected mcf- <dig> cells . nonspecific igg antibody failed to immunoprecipitate lrp <dig> . to confirm the specificity of lrp16-k <dig> complex formation we transiently transfected flag-tagged empty vector or flag-k18-c <dig>  into mcf- <dig> cells for coip assays. as shown in figure 4b, the exogenous flag-k18-c <dig> and the endogenous lrp <dig> could be reciprocally coimmunoprecipitated by use of anti-flag and/or anti-lrp <dig> antibodies. these results confirm that k <dig> can bind to lrp <dig> in mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells.

k <dig> modulates the nucleo-cytoplasmic localization of lrp <dig> in mcf- <dig> cells
k <dig>  a member of the family of intermediate filament keratins, is localized to the cytoplasm and is not generally found in the nucleus. by contrast, lrp <dig> acts as a common coactivator for the nuclear receptors erα and ar, and this implies that lrp <dig> is present in the nucleus. the physical association between k <dig> and lrp <dig> therefore suggested the possibility that k <dig> might modulate the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of lrp <dig> 

to address this possibility we examined whether increased k <dig> expression in mcf- <dig> cells might alter the subcellular distribution of a lrp16-gfp fusion protein. as expected for a nuclear protein, lrp16-gfp fluorescence was found primarily in the nucleus, and nuclear fluorescence was detected in 78% of gfp-positive cells; cytoplasmic fluorescence was only detected in 22% of gfp-positive cells cotransfected with empty vector . however, the distribution was reversed when cells expressing lrp16-gfp were cotransfected with a construct directing the expression of k <dig>  here nuclear fluorescence was detected in only 32% of gfp-positive cells whereas 68% exhibited cytoplasmic localization . these results suggest that the ectopic expression of k <dig> can sequester lrp <dig> into cytoplasm.

to further confirm this finding transfected cells were physically separated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and the distribution of lrp <dig> was analyzed by immunoblotting. mcf- <dig> cells were transfected with a k <dig> expression construct, flag-k <dig>  or with empty vector, and total, cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were analyzed using antibody to lrp <dig>  as shown in figure 6a, total lrp <dig> protein levels were not altered by ectopic expression of k <dig> in mcf- <dig> cells; by contrast, k <dig> expression significantly increased lrp <dig> levels in the cytoplasm and reduced the proportion present in the nucleus, a finding consistent with k <dig> sequestration of lrp <dig> in the cytoplasm.

to address whether endogenous k <dig> polypeptide also sequesters lrp <dig> in the cytoplasm we studied the effects of inhibiting endogenous k <dig> expression on the distribution of lrp <dig>  three different small interfering rna  duplexes directed against human k <dig> mrna, sirna <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were designed and transfected into mcf- <dig> cells; levels of lrp <dig> in the total, nuclear, and cytoplasmic fractions were measured by immunoblotting as before. levels of k <dig> polypeptide were significantly reduced by transfection with all three k <dig> sirnas as compared to cells transfected with a control sirna; knock-down activity declined in the order sirna <dig>   <dig>   <dig> . none of the sirnas affected the total levels of lrp <dig>  but knockdown of endogenous k <dig> expression with the three sirnas led to a significant and graded decrease in cytoplasmic lrp <dig> levels and a corresponding graded increase in nuclear levels . similar effects of k <dig> overexpression and knockdown on the subcellular distribution of endogenous lrp <dig> protein were also observed in human cervical cancer hela cells . together these data indicate that endogenous k <dig> sequesters lrp <dig> in the cytoplasm.

k <dig> binding to lrp <dig> modulates erα signaling
our previous studies demonstrated that lrp <dig> is a coactivator of erα in the nucleus and that knockdown of lrp <dig> in mcf- <dig> cells can significantly attenuate estradiol -stimulated erα signaling  <cit> . because k <dig> can sequester lrp <dig> from the nucleus into the cytoplasm it is possible that k <dig> expression might modulate erα signaling. to explore this possibility we assayed e2-activation of a construct in which expression of a luciferase gene  is under the control of three estrogen-response elements . cotransfection of mcf- <dig> with the 3× ere-tata-luc reporter construct and with erα and the pcdna <dig>  empty vector revealed background luciferase activity . reporter gene activity increased by  <dig> -fold on treatment with e <dig>  . however, activation was significantly attenuated by cotransfection with a construct directing k <dig> expression . consistent with our previous report  <cit> , the e2-activated reporter system was further augmented by lrp <dig> transfection , but this lrp16-enhanced reporter gene activity was also markedly impaired by cotransfection with the k <dig> expression construct . comparison of reporter gene activities in lanes  <dig> and  <dig> revealed that k <dig> suppression of e2-stimulated erα transcriptional activity was efficiently antagonized by overexpression of lrp <dig>  we next used rna interference in the cotransfection system to explore k <dig> suppression of reporter gene expression in mcf- <dig> cells. sirna directed against k <dig> was found to enhance erα-mediated transactivation in the presence of e <dig>  in the absence of e <dig>  however, knockdown of endogenous k <dig> failed to increase reporter gene expression . furthermore, coip analysis revealed that ectopic k <dig> expression in mcf- <dig> cells markedly attenuated the association of erα with lrp16; there was no evidence for any direct interaction between k <dig> and erα . consistent with our previous observations  <cit> , e <dig> stimulation enhanced the interaction between lrp <dig> and erα but had no effect on the interaction between k <dig> and lrp <dig> . together these results indicate that k <dig> can suppress e2-stimulated erα transactivation by blunting the binding of lrp <dig> to erα.

to address whether k <dig> affects e <dig> induction of erα target genes in mcf- <dig> cells we used quantitative pcr to measure mrna expression levels of the ps <dig>  cyclin d <dig>  and c-myc genes whose expression is known to be e2-regulated in mcf- <dig> cells  <cit> . as shown in figure 8a, e <dig> treatment produced a marked increase in the mrna levels of ps <dig>  cyclin d <dig>  and c-myc but not of the control gene hprt. however, this induction was attenuated by overexpression of k <dig>  overexpression of lrp <dig> efficiently relieved k <dig> inhibition of e2-induced expression of these target genes. we next analyzed e <dig> induction of these target genes in mcf- <dig> cells transfected with k <dig> sirnas. as shown in figure 8b, knockdown of endogenous k <dig> expression greatly increased the level of e2-induced up-regulation of ps <dig>  cyclin d <dig>  and c-myc mrna.

to confirm that the effects of k <dig> are mediated at the transcriptional level we used chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays to analyze erα recruitment at the ps <dig> promoter region. as shown in figure 8c, erα binding at the ps <dig> promoter was significantly increased in the presence of e <dig>  but binding was substantially blunted by overexpression of k <dig> 

we previously reported that knockdown of lrp <dig> can markedly inhibit e2-stimulated growth of mcf- <dig> cells  <cit> . to determine whether the k18-lrp <dig> association might modulate the e2-stimulated transition from the g <dig> to s phase of the cell cycle, mcf- <dig> cells were transfected with constructs directing the expression of k <dig> and/or lrp <dig> as well as with a gfp expression plasmid. the extent of dna synthesis was assessed by incorporation of brdu into gfp-positive cells. as shown in figure 9a , s-phase entry was 13% greater in e2-treated cells than in control cells , whereas in cells transfected with a construct expressing k <dig> there was only a 4% increase in s-phase entry in k18-transfected cells . furthermore, overexpression of lrp <dig> substantially increased e2-stimulated s-phase entry ; however, this increase was blocked by k <dig> overexpression . we next performed brdu incorporation assays on mcf- <dig> cells transfected with k <dig> sirna. as shown in figure 9b, transfection of k18-specific sirnas greatly increased e2-promoted s-phase entry compared to controls. together these data indicate that, by sequestering lrp <dig> in the cytoplasm, k <dig> can effectively inhibit estrogen-promoted cell-cycle progression of estrogen-sensitive mcf- <dig> breast cancer cells.

discussion
regulation of transcription factor and cofactor activity by subcellular compartmentalization is well documented  <cit> . a common mechanism is sequestration of the factor into inactive compartments, and this typically takes place via direct or indirect association with the cytoskeleton  <cit> . lrp <dig> is a new type of erα coactivator that augments the receptor's transcriptional activity in a ligand-dependent manner and can have a profound impact on the final output of cellular signaling  <cit> . lrp <dig> is though to modulate erα activity in the nucleus; in the present paper we have confirmed that a lrp16-gfp fusion protein localizes primarily to mcf- <dig> cell nuclei. we also report a new lrp <dig> ligand, k <dig>  identified by yeast two-hybrid screening. k <dig> is a member of the family of intermediate filament proteins that contribute to cytoskeletal architecture. in the present study we report that k <dig> binds to and sequesters lrp <dig> in the cytoplasm, thus preventing its nuclear action and attenuating both e2-induction of erα target genes and e2-stimulated cell cycle progression of mcf- <dig> cells. these findings underscore the functional role of k <dig> in regulating the erα signaling pathway.

lrp <dig>  a member of the macro domain protein superfamily, contains a single stand-alone macro module in its c-terminal region  <cit> . we recently demonstrated that lrp <dig> is a non-redundant coactivator of both erα and ar  <cit> . lrp <dig> was also able to interact with another  <dig> nuclear receptors  in vitro, including estrogen receptor β, the glucocorticoid receptor, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α and γ, and can efficiently amplify the transactivation of these nrs in a ligand-dependent manner  <cit> . our finding that k <dig> binds to and sequesters lrp <dig> in the cytoplasm suggests that differential tissue expression of k <dig> could constitute a new layer in the regulatory cascade of signaling pathways in which lrp <dig> participates.

keratins  provide mechanical stability to tissues, as evidenced by the range of pathological phenotypes seen in patients bearing mutations in epidermal keratins  <cit> . the intermediate filament network in simple glandular epithelial cells predominantly consists of heterotypic complexes of krts k <dig> and k <dig>  additional evidence for a more widespread role of krts comes from mouse gene knockout studies. double deletion of the genes encoding k <dig> and k <dig> results in complete loss of a functional cytokeratin skeleton and embryonic lethality  <cit> . the assembly of intermediate filament involves several steps during which the α-helical rod domain of the cytokeratin molecules plays a central role  <cit> . the head and the tail domains are not thought to be part of the filamentous backbone, and instead these protrude laterally and contribute to profilament and intermediate filament packing and to intermediate filament interaction with other cellular components  <cit> . by associating with signal transduction factors k <dig> may modulate both intracellular signaling and gene transcription. for example, k <dig> is known to bind specifically to the tumor necrosis factor  receptor type 1-associated death domain protein  through its n-terminal region and prevent tradd from binding to activated tnfr <dig>  thus attenuating tnf-induced apoptosis in simple epithelial cells  <cit> .

we report here that k <dig> binding to lrp <dig> is primarily mediated by the c-terminal region of k <dig> and the single macro domain of lrp <dig>  we used two independent approaches, including subcellular localization analysis of gfp-tagged lrp <dig> and cytoplasmic/nuclear lrp <dig> protein expression analyses, to demonstrate that ectopic k <dig> expression in mcf- <dig> cells sequesters lrp <dig> in the cytoplasm. conversely, knockdown of k <dig> gene expression increased the nuclear localization of lrp <dig>  by binding to and sequestering lrp <dig> in the cytoplasm, k <dig> prevents the nuclear action of lrp <dig> and attenuates erα signaling, thus blunting estrogen-stimulated cell-cycle progression of erα-positive breast cancer cells.

accumulating evidence from clinicopathological observations has shown that the level of k <dig> gene expression correlates inversely with the progression of breast cancer  <cit> . several reports have proposed that downregulation of k <dig> might increase the invasiveness of breast cancer cells  <cit> . it was previously demonstrated that overexpression of k <dig> in the erα-negative and highly invasive mda-mb- <dig> breast cancer cell line caused a marked reduction in the aggressiveness of the cells in vitro and in vivo but had no significant effect on cell growth rate. this change was accompanied by complete loss of the previously strong vimentin expression in the parent cell line and upregulation of adhesion proteins such as e-cadherin  <cit> . however, experimental studies and clinicopathological observations also revealed a significant association between k <dig> expression and the proliferation rate of breast cancer cells. analysis of the association between k <dig> expression and different clinicopathological risk factors revealed that k <dig> expression is highly and significantly correlated with size , differentiation grade, and mitotic index of the primary tumor  <cit> . these parameters are a function of the proliferation rate of the primary tumor, and this suggests that there is a relationship between downregulation of k <dig> expression and increased proliferative activity. in addition, the expression of the proliferation-associated antigen ki- <dig> is significantly associated with the downregulation of k <dig> in a subset of primary breast carcinomas  <cit> . moreover, cell culture experiments on bone-marrow micrometastases of breast cancer have indicated that most proliferating tumor cells lack detectable expression of k <dig> protein  <cit> . these previous data suggested that k <dig> might make an important contribution to tumor metastasis as well as to tumor cell growth. in the present study we have demonstrated that, by blunting estrogen-stimulated erα signaling activity, k <dig> can significantly suppress the growth response of mcf- <dig> cells to estrogen. we propose that the regulatory mechanism of erα transactivation by the k18-lrp <dig> association might explain in part the relationship between k <dig> downregulation and increased proliferative activity of breast cancers. however, k <dig> loss is also associated with the metastasis of erα-negative breast cancers , and it therefore appears likely that k <dig> can modulate breast cancer progression by more than one mechanism.

oncogenesis in breast cancer commonly involves excess activation of erα signaling. we previously reported that lrp <dig> mrna is overexpressed in nearly 40% of all primary breast cancer samples  <cit> . lrp <dig> overexpression in breast cancer cells is tightly linked with cell proliferation and enhanced erα activation  <cit> . as a functional suppressor of lrp <dig>  k <dig> is frequently absent from different types of breast carcinoma  <cit> . excess activation of erα function in tumor cells is commonly mediated by overexpression of erα and/or its coactivators including lrp <dig>  <cit> . we now propose a further level of regulation that can modulate erα function in breast cancer. loss of k <dig> from erα-positive breast tumor cells releases the functional activity of lrp <dig>  and is thus likely to promote tumor cell proliferation. tests that evaluate the subcellular localization of lrp <dig> in erα-positive breast tumor cells therefore have potential in the categorization of different clinopathological stages.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, these findings provide evidence that k <dig> binding to lrp <dig> leads to cytoplasmic sequestration of lrp <dig>  by determining the nuclear availability of the receptor coactivator lrp <dig>  k <dig> can not only modulate the transcriptional activity of erα in response to estrogen but can also govern estrogen-stimulated cell cycle progression of mcf- <dig> cells. loss of k <dig> from erα-positive breast tumor cells releases the functional activity of lrp <dig>  and such loss is thus likely to promote tumor proliferation. these findings underscore a functional role for k <dig> in regulating the erα signaling pathway.
