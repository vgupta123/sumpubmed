BACKGROUND
nematodes are among the most common, abundant and ecologically diverse animal groups. free-living species inhabit almost every environment, and are extremely abundant in soils and aquatic sediments, both freshwater and marine  <cit> . most nematode diversity is represented by these free-living species  <cit> . nematode parasites of plants and animals are also frequently encountered, and cause reductions in agricultural productivity, and disease in humans, domestic animals and wildlife  <cit> . plant-parasitic nematodes attack a wide variety of commercial crops, mainly causing damage to root tissues  <cit>  that impacts on the physiology of the host plant  <cit> , particularly water transport. plant parasites are usually microscopic, and may feed on plant tissues as ectoparasites or endoparasites, depending on the species. among the most remarkable specializations of plant parasites are sedentary endoparasites that induce nurse cells in host plant roots that serve as metabolic sinks and nematode feeding sites, sustaining the sedentary female nematode during its lifetime in the host tissue. other plant-parasitic species have more diverse feeding habits. for example, the pine wilt nematode bursaphelenchus xylophilus, which is transmitted by wood-boring beetles, has both phytophagous and mycophagous phases in its life history.

molecular phylogenies based on ssu rdna  <cit>  indicate that three traditional orders of plant parasites, dorylaimida pearse  <dig>  triplonchida cobb  <dig>  and tylenchida thorne  <dig> evolved independently. modern taxonomic systems for nematodes  <cit>  are mainly based on the phylogenetic framework provided by ssu rdna in combination with new interpretations of developmental and morphological features. in the taxonomy of de ley and blaxter  <cit> , which is used herein, orders dorylaimida and triplonchida  are retained, whereas the phylogenetic framework guides taxonomic reorganization of a diverse assemblage of species  within suborder tylenchina . within tylenchina, the infraorder tylenchomorpha includes stylet-bearing nematodes with representatives that are plant-parasites, insect associates or parasites , and fungal feeders. several of the superfamilies within tylenchomorpha include important plant pathogens  <cit> , particularly tylenchoidea , but also aphelenchoidea, the superfamily that includes insect associates, fungivores, and plant-associates that in some cases are either direct causative agents of plant disease , or through fungal feeding are associated with root disease . the relationship and taxonomy of groups now classified as tylenchomorpha, and specifically the relationship of aphelenchs to other stylet-bearing tylenchina, has been a topic of debate among nematode taxonomists for several decades.

some arguments for a close relationship between aphelenchs and tylenchomorpha have been based on morphology, for example, the highly similar protrusible stylets  in these taxa  <cit> , or aspects of female genital structure  <cit> . however, siddiqi  <cit>  suggested that the similar stylets of these nematodes arose independently, with the stylet of aphelenchs derived from diplogasteromorph ancestors, thus rejecting the concept of their close evolutionary relationship. siddiqi  <cit>  recognized aphelenchs as a separate evolutionary group  <cit> .

in recent years, phylogenetic relationships inferred from ssu rdna sequences  <cit>  have provided an alternative framework for nematode classification. representatives of tylenchomorpha including certain aphelenchs  comprised a clade, with the fungivorous aphelenchidae typically the sister group to plant-parasitic tylenchomorphs. however, the aphelenchoidea were not monophyletic  <cit> , with plant pathogens such as aphelenchoides spp. and bursaphelenchus spp.  either unresolved among tylenchina  <cit>  or more closely related to panagrolaimomorpha, but in the latter case with support levels varying substantially, depending on inference method  <cit> . recent fine structure reconstructions of the pharynx also call into question the monophyly of aphelenchoidea, revealing lack of cellular homology underlying structures previously assumed to unite aphelenchidae and aphelenchoididae  <cit> . it is unclear if artefacts such as base compositional bias or long-branch-attraction may be influencing the position of bursaphelenchus spp. and other aphelenchoididae in ssu trees, but this potential caveat has been suggested as one possible explanation for non-monophyly  <cit> . for this reason, independent phylogenetic evidence from other gene loci is needed to test this and other hypotheses of nematode relationships.

as in many other metazoan groups, comparative analysis of nematode mitochondrial  genome information  appears useful for resolving relationships at different divergence levels  <cit> . to date,  <dig> complete mt genomes have been reported for nematodes , however, taxon sampling is biased toward parasites of vertebrates. despite their importance to agriculture, tylenchomorpha are undersampled for complete mitochondrial genomes. published reports include the complete sequence of the burrowing nematode  <cit> radopholus similis , and partial genome, but complete coding sequences of the soybean cyst nematode  <cit> heterodera glycines . however, the focus of these studies has been on idiosyncratic features of the mt sequences and not phylogenetic context. in this study, we determined the complete mitochondrial dna sequences of bursaphelenchus xylophilus, the first representative of the aphelenchoidea and pratylenchus vulnus, the second representative of the family pratylenchidae, respectively, and used these data for inferring phylogenetic relationships among the major groups of chromadoreans.

RESULTS
gene contents and organization
the complete mitochondrial genomes of b. xylophilus  and p. vulnus  are  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively. the mtdna of p. vulnus is the largest among chromadorean nematode mtdnas published to date. it is much larger than radopholus similis , the first complete mtdna for tylenchoidea  <cit> , and p. vulnus is third largest among all nematodes reported to date, following two mermithida, romanomermis culicivorax  and hexamermis agrotis . unlike enopleans, the mtdna genomes of chromadorean nematodes do not normally exceed  <dig> kb. the exception is the soybean cyst nematode heterodera glycines that is estimated to have a 21– <dig> kb-circular mtdna chromosome  <cit> . the remarkably large size of p. vulnus mtdna is due to abnormally lengthy non-coding regions that harbor tandemly repeated sequences. this feature was also reported for the root-knot nematode meloidogyne javanica , which contains a  <dig> kb control region with different numbers of tandemly repeated sequence units  <cit> . in some enoplea , size variation ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kb is relatively common and is attributed to a ‘hypervariable’ segment that includes both coding and putative nonfunctional regions . the complete mitochondrial genomes of b. xylophilus  and p. vulnus  contain  <dig> genes that comprise  <dig> protein-coding genes  but lacking atp <dig>   <dig> trna and  <dig> rrna genes, all encoded in the same direction. this gene content is common to all other nematode mtdnas so far sequenced, except for trichinella spiralis  in which atp <dig> is also encoded  <cit> . the details of gene order and size for mtdna of b. xylophilus and p. vulnus are shown in table  <dig>  the nucleotide composition of the mtdna genome of each species has a strong bias toward a+t-richness with overall content of  <dig> % in b. xylophilus  and  <dig> % in p. vulnus , respectively . the a+t richness in these two species is related to the propensity for high frequency use of t-rich and/or a-rich codons in their protein-coding genes and higher a+t content in non-coding regions .

* <dig> bp intergenic sequence between trne and cox <dig> 

protein-coding genes 
twelve pcgs were identified from both species, ranging from  <dig> bp  to  <dig>  bp  for b. xylophilus and from  <dig> bp  to  <dig>  bp  for p. vulnus. total length of the  <dig> pcgs of b. xylophilus mtdna is  <dig>  bp, accounting for  <dig> % of its total mtdna genome length. this value is slightly lower than most chromadoreans, such as caenorhabditis briggsae , ascaris suum  and anisakis simplex . in contrast, total length of the  <dig> pcgs of p. vulnus mtdna  accounts for less than half  of its entire genome length. this lowered proportion of pcg sequence in p. vulnus is due to extraordinarily lengthy non-coding regions. this is very uncommon in other chromadorean nematode mtdnas except for heterorhabditis bacteriophora , but known for enoplean mitochondrial genomes, for example, hexamermis agrotis , and romanomermis culicivorax .

out of  <dig> pcgs of b. xylophilus mtdna, nine  are inferred to use att as the start codon, whereas three  start with ata . although atg is known to be the most commonly used initiation codon for mitochondrial pcgs  <cit> , use of others such as ttg is very common in some other nematode mtdnas, including anisakis simplex  and enterobius vermicularis . out of  <dig> p. vulnus pcgs, six  are inferred to use ata as the start codon. four genes  start with att, whereas nad <dig> and nad <dig> start with ttg . the most commonly used start codon for p. vulnus  is also the most frequently used in xiphinema americanum mtdna . more rarely, tta is used as a start codon in nematodes, for example, ancylostoma doudenale , brugia malayi  and steinernema carpocapsae .

for b. xylophilus, nine genes  terminate with taa and cox <dig> uses tag as its termination codon; atp <dig> and cob are inferred to terminate with incomplete stop codon t. among these, cox <dig> is inferred to overlap with trnh by two nucleotides  and nad <dig> is also inferred to overlap with atp <dig> by five nucleotides. the truncated  termination codon  is inferred for the atp <dig> and cob of b. xylophilus; truncated termination ‘t’ is believed to be completed by polyadenylation  <cit> . for p. vulnus, eight genes  are predicted to terminate with tag and four  with taa, all without overlapping any adjacent gene boundary. the use of taa as a termination codon in p. vulnus is generally consistent with another tylenchoidea, h. glycines <cit> , but is in marked contrast to the idiosyncratic codon usage found in the other sequenced member of the same superfamily, r. similis in which taa, the canonical stop codon in the standard invertebrate genetic code, is reassigned to encode tyr  <cit> .

as in other published nematode mtdnas, the mitochondrial pcgs of these two species are notably biased toward using amino acids encoded by t-rich codons. the three most frequently used codons have more than two ts in a triplet : in b. xylophilus, ttt , tta , and att ; in p. vulnus, ttt , tta , and att . these t-rich codons account for  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the total codons used. in addition, there is nonrandom use of synonymous codons; avoidance of c in the third codon position is pronounced in two- and four-fold degenerate codon families. as an example, there are large differences in the relative frequency of codons for phenylalanine usage between ttt  and ttc  in b. xylophilus and between ttt  and ttc  in p. vulnus. the higher frequency of amino acids encoded by t-rich codons, and unequal synonymous codon usage with bias against c-rich codons is consistent with the high percentage of a+t content in the nucleotide composition of pcgs .

transfer rna and ribosomal rna genes
twenty-two discrete nucleotide sequences  were predicted to fold into secondary structures of trnas , similar to those found in other published nematode mtdnas  <cit> . the predicted structures of trna genes in both species include an amino-acyl stem of seven nucleotide pairs , a dhu stem of  <dig> ntp with a loop, an anticodon stem of  <dig> ntp with a loop, and a tv replacement loop. twenty of the  <dig> trna genes of both species have a unique feature in that the tΨc arm and variable loop are replaced by a tv replacement loop. the two exceptions are the serine trnas  that lack a dhu arm, but have a tΨc stem-loop structure. these features are found in other nematode mtdnas  <cit> , except for t. spiralis in which some trnas have the canonical cloverleaf structures  <cit> . the small-subunit ribosomal rna  and large-subunit ribosomal rna  of each mtdna were initially identified by comparing with homologous gene sequence of other nematode species. the rrnl  and rrns  for b. xylophilus are positioned between trnh and nad <dig>  and between trne and trns <dig>  respectively. the rrnl  and rrns  for p. vulnus are positioned between trnl <dig> and nad <dig>  and between cob and trny, respectively.

non-coding regions
for the b. xylophilus mtdna, a total of  <dig> intergenic sequences, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp, were found. of these, the largest non-coding region , located between nad <dig> and cox <dig> genes, contains four identical repeat units of 147-nt, four identical repeat units of 101-nt, plus three identical repeat units of 56-nt with only a single nucleotide mismatch in the first repeat of the 56-nt repeat units. this ncr is extremely a+t-rich , much higher than the entire mtdna sequence . in p. vulnus mtdna,  <dig> intergenic sequences were found, ranging from a singleton to  <dig>  bp , accounting for  <dig> % of the genome sequence. among these, two non-coding regions  are very conspicuous due to their lengths; ncr <dig>  between cox <dig> and trnh, and ncr <dig>  between trnh and trnl <dig> . there are three repeated units of a 494-bp sequence  found in the 5’ region of ncr <dig>  the mitochondrial ncr in many metazoans contains a sequence motif for replication origin  that varies from a few hundred bp to tens of kb, with tandemly repeated sequence blocks in a ‘head-to-tail’ fashion. the presence of lengthy repeated segments in non-coding regions is responsible for exceptionally large mtdna genome size and often contributes to genome size variation among and within individuals  and/or species in some other metazoans including american shad  <cit> , bark weevils  <cit> , root-knot nematodes  <cit> , scallops  <cit>  and some mermithid nematodes  <cit> . comparative analysis of size variants might be useful for estimating the genetic structure of populations within species and between closely related species  <cit> .

mitochondrial phylogeny among major chromadorean groups
we conducted bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide  and amino acid  sequence datasets  for  <dig> nematode species, including the two newly sequenced species. the sequence alignments are deposited in treebase . phylogenetic relationships were mainly consistent with previous reports based on mitochondrial genome analysis  <cit> . chromadoreans formed a monophyletic group in all analyses with robust nodal support  and  <dig> - <dig>  bayesian posterior probability , . within the chromadorea ‘clade iii’  as previously recovered from ssu rdna  <cit>  was not monophyletic, regardless of the dataset analyzed or tree-building method. the position of oxyuridomorpha within chromadorea varies among the mtdna analyses. for the nt dataset, oxyuridomorpha was sister to the spiruromorpha  with high nodal support , but in the aa dataset, oxyuridomorpha was sister to a large chromadorean clade , with moderate  or strong  support . the relationship of pristionchus pacificus, the only representative of the free-living infraorder diplogasteromorpha, differed among analyses. for the nt dataset, p. pacificus was nested within certain rhabditomorpha  and this relationship was strongly supported  and  <dig>  bpp in bi . for the aa dataset, the position of p. pacificus differed by inference method, with ml  showing p. pacificus as sister to the rhabditoidea clade. in contrast, bi of the aa data  depicted p. pacificus as nested within the sampled rhabditoidea, with strong support .

gene order pattern in metazoan mitochondrial dna has often been used as an additional tool for inferring relationships  <cit> . there are some reports of lineage-specific idiosyncratic gene order patterns in metazoans including nematodes , and these cases illustrate that phylogenetic interpretation of gene arrangement data should be made with great caution. for example, gene order patterns for enoplean species are not only very diverse, but radical gene rearrangements occur between relatively closely related species  <cit> . in contrast, mitochondrial gene order of chromadoreans is more conserved with substantial gene order pattern similarity  within groups inferred to be monophyletic based on analysis of mtdna sequences. with the exception of s. sterocoralis and h. bacteriophora in which substantial idiosyncratic gene arrangements distinguish them from other ordinal members , shared gene order patterns for chromadorean species has been interpreted as an additional indicator of their phylogenetic affinity  <cit> . the highly similar gene arrangement shared among most rhabditomorpha, ascaridomorpha, and the few representatives of diplogasteromorpha and aphelenchoidea for which data are available, may reflect common ancestry. however, within this clade, gene order data provides little information on relationships due to the high overall similarity.

phylogenetic relationships of aphelenchoidea and tylenchoidea
one aim of the present study was to assess tylenchomorpha relationships, and specifically between b. xylophilus and species of tylenchoidea. the hypothesis of tylenchomorpha monophyly was examined with respect to relationships among chromadorean lineages. the phylogenetic trees inferred from both nucleotide and amino acid sequences are in agreement that tylenchomorpha is not monophyletic . instead, b. xylophilus  was consistently found within the clade consisting of rhabditomorpha, panagrolaimomorpha, diplogasteromorpha, and ascaridomorpha , and usually  “between” strongyloides stercoralis and steinernema carpocapsae . the clade of sampled tylenchoidea, consisting of radopholus similis , heterodera glycines  and pratylenchus vulnus , was sister to the other sampled chromadorea in all analyses with very high nodal support  and  <dig>  bpp in bi  for the nt dataset and 100% bp in ml  and  <dig>  bpp in bi  for the aa dataset). this result indicates that there is no support from the mtdna genome tree for a sister-group relationship between tylenchoidea and b. xylophilus , or monophyly of tylenchomorpha as currently defined  <cit> . statistical evaluation of the alternative phylogenetic tree of highest likelihood with the constraint of tylenchoidea plus b. xylophilus monophyly was a significantly worse interpretation of these mtdna data . phylogenetic hypotheses based on nuclear ssu rdna also do not support monophyly of tylenchida-aphelenchoidea  <cit> , but with different relationships recovered than for mtdna. in ssu trees including the most compre-hensive sampling for tylenchomorpha, aphelenchs are polyphyletic, with fungal-feeding taxa such as aphelenchus spp.  more closely related to plant-parasitic tylenchoidea  <cit> , and the aphelenchoididae such as b. xylophilus and aphelenchoides spp. either more closely related to panagrolaimomorpha, or nested among a polyphyletic assemblage of panagrolaimomorph taxa  <cit> . lack of appropriate taxon sampling for mtdna genomes precludes direct comparison with these ssu results or statistical evaluation of certain alternative topologies, highlighting the need to sequence mtdna genomes representing a greater diversity of nematoda, especially additional tylenchina , and other families and superfamilies within tylenchomorpha. this lack of taxon representation in the mtdna genome tree may influence the sister-group relationship of tylenchoidea to other chromadorea, because adding taxa  tends to break long branches, such as those characteristic of p. vulnus, r. similis, and h. glycines.

alternative topologies tested are provided in additional file  <dig> 

in the mtdna analyses of tylenchoidea, the two sampled members of pratylenchidae were not sister taxa, instead, r. similis  was sister to h. glycines  with very strong support  and  <dig>  bpp in bi ) for the nt dataset. in terms of mtdna gene arrangement patterns, r. similis and h. glycines share gene boundaries for atp6-nad5-trnq-trna, rrnl-nad <dig>  trni-cox <dig>  trnt-nad <dig>  and trns1-trnc, whereas these two species share less gene order similarity with p. vulnus . the monophyly of tylenchoidea was strongly supported with p. vulnus  sister to r. similis and h. glycines  and  <dig>  bpp in bi  for the nt dataset and 100% bp in ml  and  <dig>  bpp in bi  for the aa dataset, respectively). comprehensive phylogenetic hypotheses based on ssu rdna sequences also strongly support the monophyly of tylenchomorpha, but not pratylenchidae  <cit> . as in the mtdna results, analysis of ssu rdna shows that r. similis is more closely related to heterodera spp. than to p. vulnus or other pratylenchus spp.  <cit> . thus, phylogenetic analysis of both ssu and mtdna genome data independently show that pratylenchidae, as traditionally defined, is not a natural group.

thorne  <cit>  first proposed that aphelenchs and tylenchs should be treated as two superfamilies  within a separate order , distinguishing this group from other nematodes. subsequently, taxonomic authorities have offered several different interpretations for the relationships and taxonomic ranking of these nematodes. many systematists have given special emphasis to morphological similarities shared between aphelenchs and tylenchs, as discerned by light microscopy, such as the protrusible stomatostylet, esophageal structures, and genital structure in females  <cit> . maggenti  <cit>  hypothesized that plant parasitism in nematodes evolved from fungal-feeding ancestors, and that the progenitors of these taxa were diplogasteromorph-like. similarly, poinar  <cit>  emphasized a close relationship between tylenchs, aphelenchs and diplogasteromorphs based on similarities in pharyngeal structure. later, maggenti  <cit>  recognized tylenchs and aphelenchs as separate orders within a subclass . this ‘diplogasteromorph origin’ was hypothesized on the basis of the general similarity of esophageal structure among tylenchs, aphelenchs, and diplogasteromorphs and inferences concerning development of stoma armature  from stomatal features of certain diplogasteromorphs. siddiqi  <cit>  argued that these morphologically similar stylets arose independently in tylenchs and aphelenchs, asserting that plant parasitism in these two groups had separate evolutionary origins, with the former evolved from cephalobomorph/oxyuridomorph-like ancestors and the latter from diplogasteromorph-like ancestors. our mitochondrial genome phylogeny  did not support a close relationship between diplogasteromorphs  and either tylenchs  or aphelenchs . similarly, oxyuridomorphs  and tylenchs did not form a clade. tree topology tests indicated that alternative phylogenies constraining a sister-group relationship between diplogasteromorpha and tylenchoidea, diplogasteromorpha and aphelenchoidea, or oxyuridomorpha and tylenchoidea were significantly worse interpretations of these mtdna data . considering the gene arrangement pattern among these nematodes  the sampled rhabditomorpha, panagrolaimomorpha, diplogasteromorpha, ascaridomorpha and b. xylophilus have almost identical patterns with only a translocation of trnn for b. xylophilus . indeed, except for the non-coding region ,  <dig> of the species within the clade containing b. xylophilus share this most common gene arrangement type. in contrast, the gene order of only four blocks comprising two consecutive genes  is shared between p. vulnus, r. similis and b. xylophilus. moreover, only a single block  is shared between b. xylophilus and all three tylenchs .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we investigated the phylogenetic relationships of chromadorean nematodes, including new sequences of tylenchomorpha previously unrepresented in mtdna genome trees. the mitochondrial genomes of b. xylophilus and p. vulnus are  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively, and identical to all other chromadorean nematode mtdnas in that they contain  <dig> genes  encoded in the same direction. pratylenchus vulnus has the largest mitochondrial genome of any chromadorean nematode sequenced, due to a large fraction  of non-coding sequence. phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide and amino acid sequence datasets using maximum likelihood and bayesian methods did not support monophyly of tylenchomorpha. instead, b. xylophilus was nested within the rhabditomorpha+ascaridomorpha+panagrolaimomorpha+diplogasteromorpha clade, and tylenchoidea  was sister to all analyzed chromadoreans. comparison of gene arrangement data was also consistent with the phylogenetic relationships as inferred from sequence data. statistical comparison of alternative tree topologies revealed that constraining tylenchomorpha to be monophyletic was a significantly worse interpretation of these mtdna data. these results confirm previous findings based on nuclear ssu rdna, indicating that aphelench and tylench plant parasites do not share an exclusive most recent common ancestor, and revealing that certain morphological similarities between these stylet-bearing nematodes must result from convergent evolution.
