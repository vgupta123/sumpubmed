BACKGROUND
the innate immune system is referred to as the first line in host defense against invading pathogens  <cit> . its highly developed ability to recognize microbial patterns and host-derived danger signals relies on so-called pattern recognition receptors , especially on the toll-like receptors  . in humans, the tlr family is composed of  <dig> members, which are located at the cell surface with the exception of tlr <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which are localized on intracellular endosomal membranes . the tlrs are involved in the recognition of a wide variety of ligands, including pathogen associated molecular patterns , such as bacterial cell wall components and viral rna, as well as damage associated molecular patterns   <cit> . this leads to subsequent intracellular signal transduction, triggering the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, but it can also lead to anti-inflammatory responses as has been recently shown for tlr <dig> acting as a heterodimer with tlr <dig>  <cit> .

the recognition of pamps and damps by different tlrs is directed by structurally conserved leucine-rich repeats  motifs of the tlrs ectodomains   <cit> . cell-surface tlrs can mediate binding to pamps by homodimerizing, like tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> that recognize lipopolysaccharide   <cit>  and flagellin  <cit> , respectively. in contrast, other tlrs form heterodimers like tlr <dig> that associates with tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  in conjunction recognizing lipopeptides and lipoproteins  <cit> . the diversity of tlr <dig> dimer combinations is thought to be responsible for its extensive recognition ability, ranging from the diverse components of various pathogens to the host heat-shock protein  <dig>  <cit> . tlr <dig> plays an important role in resistance to the infection induced by mycobacterium tuberculosis   <cit> . for example, mcbride et al. demonstrated that tlr <dig> knockout mice show enhanced cell infiltration and inflammation in lungs upon low dose chronic infection with mtb, and fail to stably control the bacterial burden  <cit> . a series of components of mtb can trigger the tlr <dig> signaling pathway upon infection, such as triacylated lipoprotein lprg, lpqh and phos <dig>  <cit> , and glycolipid lipoarabinomannan  <cit> . pam3cysserlys <dig>  is a synthetic triacylated lipopeptide that mimics the triacylated lipoprotein of mycobacteria and classical gram-positive bacteria, which can be recognized by tlr2/tlr <dig> heterodimers and induce the production and release of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines , chemokines  and interferon  . most of these studies on the responses of the tlr <dig> signaling pathway have been performed in cell culture systems. a notable exception is the reported transcriptome response of mouse mononuclear phagocytes recruited to lungs challenged with pam3csk <dig> as measured by micro-arrays  <cit> . as another example 8 day old mice were treated with pam3csk <dig> and analyzed for the expression of several inflammatory genes using qpcr  <cit> .

the zebrafish embryonic model has much potential to study the ligand specificity of tlrs at the organism level  <cit> . importantly, zebrafish offers the possibility to study the innate immune system separated from the adaptive immune system in their embryonic and larval stages  . to date, a number of tlr signaling pathway mediators have been identified and studied in zebrafish such as the adaptor proteins myd <dig>  tirap , trif and sarm <dig> , and the downstream signaling intermediates irak and traf <dig>  <cit> .

in work previously published by our group, we demonstrated that the function and regulation of the zebrafish homologs of human tlr <dig>  tlr5a and tlr5b, are conserved with their mammalian counterparts. both tlr5a and tlr5b are strongly up-regulated in response to salmonella typhimurium infection  <cit> . furthermore, in the same study it was shown that knockdown of these two genes prevented or weakened the activation of genes for several inflammatory mediators like mmp <dig>  cxcl-c1c, il1b and il <dig> upon flagellin stimulation  <cit> .

in this study, we aimed to study tlr <dig> function, in comparison with tlr <dig>  in zebrafish using transcriptome analysis. injection into the blood stream of the tlr2/tlr <dig> ligand pam3csk <dig>  was followed by transcriptome profiling to characterize key genes involved in the early response to this pamps. in addition, by comparing the transcriptome response towards treatment with flagellin, we were able to discriminate non-specific immune responsive genes from a set of genes which are regulated by tlr <dig> but not by tlr <dig> 

methods
zebrafish husbandry
wild-type zebrafish of the ab/tl strain were handled in compliance with the local animal welfare regulations and maintained according to standard protocols . embryos were raised in egg water  at  <dig>  °c. for the duration of bacterial injections, embryos were kept under anesthesia in egg water containing  <dig>  % buffered 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester . the breeding of adult fish was approved by the local animal welfare committee  of the university of leiden. all protocols adhered to the international guidelines specified by the eu animal protection directive 2010/63/eu.

morpholino injections
morpholino oligonucleotides  were diluted to desired concentrations in 1× danieu’s buffer  <dig>   <dig>  mm hepes ) containing 1× phenol red . for knockdown experiments, tlr <dig> atg-morpholino  was injected with the optimal concentration at  <dig>  mm and 1 nl volume per embryo at 0 ~  <dig> cell stage. tlr <dig> translation was blocked via injecting 1 nl of the tlr5a and tlr5b atg-morpholinos at a dose of  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm at 0 ~  <dig> cell stage, as previously published by stockhammer and coworkers  <cit> . control embryos were injected with the standard control morpholino .

ligands injection
for the ligands injection assay, purified pam3csk <dig>  and flagellin from s. typhimurium  were respectively diluted to 1 mg/ml and 100 μg/ml in sterile water. for their administration, 1 nl of the ligands was injected into the blood stream at  <dig> hpf, and sterile water was used as control. injections were perormed using a femtojet microinjector  and a micromanipulator with pulled microcapillary pipettes.

rna isolation, cdna synthesis and qpcr
rna was extracted using trizol reagent  and purified by column according to the manufacturer’s instructions of rneasy minelute cleanup kit . the concentration and quality of rna were detected by nanodrop 2000/2000c . 1 μg cdna synthesis reactions and qpcr were performed as described in the manufacturer’s instructions  and normalized against the expression of ppial as a housekeeping gene  <cit> . pcr analysis was performed using the following protocol: 95 °c 3 min, 40 cycles real time of 95 °c 15 s and 60 °c 45 s, and final melting curve of 81 cycles from 95 °c 1 min to 55 °c 10 s. results were analyzed using the ΔΔct method. primer sequences used can be found in additional file 1: table s <dig>

RESULTS
the immune response of zebrafish embryos to injection of pamps in the caudal vein
in a recent study by stockhammer et al, it was shown that flagellin injected into the caudal vein at 27 h post fertilization  induced several immune response marker genes as measured by qpcr  <cit> . to further characterize the response to another well characterized pamp, we injected pam3csk <dig> using the same method. the expression levels of cytokine genes il1b, tnfa and il <dig>  the chemokine gene il <dig>  and anti-inflammatory gene il <dig>  were measured by qpcr at  <dig>   <dig> and 6 h post injection  respectively . the results show that there was a significant up-regulation of these genes upon pam3csk <dig> stimulation. for all these marker genes the induction was transient and followed by a gradual decrease over time. the il1b gene was the only marker of which up-regulation was observed at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi, with a significantly higher expression than the control group . for the tnfa, il <dig>  il <dig> and il <dig> genes there was a more obvious decrease of induction over time . these results show that pam3csk <dig> induces similar responses in zebrafish as in mammalian cells  suggesting that this response is also mediated via the tlr <dig> signaling pathway.fig.  <dig> immune genes expression at different time points upon pam3csk <dig> stimulation. embryos were injected at  <dig> hpf with 1 ng pam3csk <dig> and expression levels of il1b , il <dig> , tnfa , il <dig>  and il <dig>  were determined at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hpi by qpcr. data  are combined from at least three biological replicates  and expressed relative to their corresponding mock injection  control, which is set at  <dig>  statistical significance of differences between mock and pam3csk <dig> groups was determined by anova analysis and tukey’s multiple comparisons test, *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> 




the function of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> in the immune response towards flagellin and pam3csk4
in order to study the function of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> in the above described responses to pam3csk <dig> and flagellin we used morpholinos to knockdown these genes. there are two orthologous genes of human tlr <dig> in zebrafish, tlr5a and tlr5b and previous studies in our group showed that they are required for activation of host defense genes upon flagellin stimulation. this was shown by simultaneous co-knockdown of tlr5a and tlr5b by morpholinos  <cit> . in this study, tlr5a and tlr5b morpholinos were injected separately and, subsequently the morphants were stimulated with flagellin at  <dig> hpf. embryos treated with standard control morpholino were used as a control  <cit> . the expression of il1b was measured at 1hpi by qpcr. our results revealed that abrogation of both tlr5a and tlr5b effectively prevented the il1b up-regulation observed in control embryos upon flagellin stimulation .fig.  <dig>

the function of tlr <dig> in recognition of pam3csk <dig> was tested in the same manner. our results showed that tlr <dig> morphants did not exhibit up-regulation of il1b expression upon pam3csk <dig> stimulation, while the control morphants did . in contrast, tlr <dig> morphants stimulated with flagellin, still showed a significant induction of il1b expression .

identification of a common response gene set for pam3csk <dig> and flagellin stimulation
since comparisons of the transcriptome response to pamps that activate different tlrs has not been described before in a whole organism we decided to perform rna deep sequencing  of embryos treated with flagellin and pam3csk <dig> at  <dig> hpi.

embryos injected with sterile water were used as control and rna was isolated from a pool of at least fifteen embryos per condition. triplicates of biological samples were analyzed with illumina rnaseq and at least  <dig>  million mapped reads were obtained for each library . although such reads numbers are insufficient to detect changes in very lowly expressed genes  approximately  <dig> million total reads is currently a good cost efficient number that matches the sensitivity of microarrays  <cit> . the results of the transcriptional responses are summarized in fig. 3a and additional file 3: figure s <dig>  the results show that at any given p-value , flagellin leads to a higher number of differentially expressed genes  than pam3csk <dig>  to further analyze the data, we arbitrarily used a threshold of 2-fold change and p-value < <dig> . this p-value corresponds to fdr adjusted p-values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in the different experiments. these selection criteria are not very stringent so as to prevent loosing genes that are very lowly expressed and therefore with the used sequencing depth will have obtained only low numbers of reads. the entire list of responses without any selection criteria is given in additional file 4: table s <dig> and additional file 5: table s <dig>  applying these settings we obtained  <dig> degs from the pam3csk <dig> stimulated group, composed of  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated genes, and  <dig> degs from the flagellin injected group, composed of  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated genes . therefore, with both treatments there are more genes up-regulated than down-regulated. in the list of top induced and repressed genes there is a lack of any annotation in the data bases . we compared these two groups of genes and found an overlap set of only  <dig> genes that include many immune marker genes, such as il1b, tnfb, irak <dig> and irg1l, and transcription factors, like fos, fosl <dig> and junba, as shown by the gene ontology terms  annotation in fig. 3b and additional file 6: table s <dig> .fig.  <dig> rnaseq experimental setup and comparison of gene sets responsive to pam3csk <dig> or flagellin stimulation. a, setup of the rnaseq experiment. zebrafish embryos received a 1 nl injection of 1 mg/ml pam3csk <dig> and 100 μg/ml flagellin respectively into the caudal vein at 27hpf. control embryos were injected with water. samples for rnaseq were taken at 1hpi. the numbers of differentially expressed genes were assessed by two criteria: 1) p <  <dig> ,  <dig> fold-change or 2) adjusted p-value < <dig> , without fc cut-off. b venn diagram showing the overlap between degs from pam3csk <dig> and flagellin stimulations and their go terms annotation. c fold-change values of inflammatory genes in rnaseq. d filtering of  <dig> degs from pam3csk <dig> stimulation  by the flagellin non-specific set  results in  <dig> pam3csk <dig> specific genes, which are grouped according to their go terms annotation. e filtering of  <dig> degs from flagellin stimulation  by the pam3csk <dig> non-specific set , results in  <dig> flagellin specific genes, which are grouped according to their go terms annotation. degs, differentially expressed genes; fc, fold-change



the induction of il1b, tnfa and il <dig> by pam3csk <dig> shown using qpcr  was confirmed by the rnaseq data , but in the case of il <dig> and il <dig> there was no induction with flagellin.

identification of gene sets that are specifically regulated by pam3csk <dig> and flagellin
this study unexpectedly revealed that there is a relatively large group of genes that are only induced or repressed by either pam3csk <dig> or flagellin . to further test whether this specifically induced group is completely unaffected by the other pamp treatment we used a rigorous filtering approach as shown in fig. 3d and e. for this approach, the degs from the pam3csk <dig>  and flagellin  stimulation groups were compared with the group of genes that were not affected by flagellin  and pam3csk <dig> , respectively, with a cut-off setting at < <dig> -fold change and p >  <dig> . by taking the overlap of these sets we thereby exclude genes that were inducible by the other ligand even at very low stringency. this resulted in a set of  <dig> genes  for which the response is specific to pam3csk <dig> and a set of  <dig> genes  for which the response is specific to flagellin. go analysis indicated that these two groups contain different categories . most notably, genes with high fold-change  from the pam3csk <dig> specific group include many transcription factors involved in the tlr signaling pathway, such as junbb, cebpb, fosb, fosl1a, egr <dig> and nr4a <dig>  in the flagellin specific group of genes this is not the case and an obvious enriched category could not be identified.

to confirm the result of deep sequencing, qpcr was performed to verify the responses of genes from the pam3csk <dig> specific gene set, namely junbb, cebpb, fosb, fosl1a, egr <dig> and nr4a <dig> . as expected, the expression level of all these transcription factors confirmed the deep sequencing result. moreover, these genes did not exhibit an apparent differential expression in zebrafish upon flagellin stimulation except fosl1a and junbb . even though the expression of these both genes showed significant induction upon flagellin stimulation, the induction level was still far lower than that upon pam3csk <dig> stimulation.fig.  <dig> qpcr analysis of transcription factors genes responsive to pamps stimulation. expression levels of fosl1a, fosb, junbb, cebpeb, egr <dig> and nr4a <dig> following pam3csk <dig> and flagellin stimulation are determined by qpcr. data  are combined from at least tree biological replicates  and expressed relative to their corresponding water control, which is set at  <dig>  statistical significance was determined by two-way anova analysis and tukey’s multiple comparisons test, *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> , ****p <  <dig> 




function of the tlr <dig> and tlr5a genes in the transcriptome responses to pam3csk <dig> and flagellin
to confirm that the transcriptome responses upon pamps stimulation described above  are tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> specific, we performed rnaseq analyses of the pam3csk <dig> and flagellin responses under tlr <dig> and tlr5a knockdown conditions, again using biological triplicates of each group. setting a threshold of  <dig> fold-change and p <  <dig> , we found that the  <dig> common degs responsive to both pam3csk <dig> and flagellin were reduced by tlr <dig> and tlr5a knockdown . furthermore, all the  <dig> genes  from the pam3csk <dig> specific group showed no longer a differential expression or an anti-correlated expression after tlr <dig> knockdown and, similarly all the  <dig> genes  from the flagellin specific group showed no longer a differential expression or an anti-correlated expression upon tlr5a abrogation . overall, these results confirm the specificity of both morpholinos and show that zebrafish tlr <dig> and tlr5a are key mediators of the transcriptomic response triggered by injection of pam3csk <dig> and flagellin respectively.fig.  <dig> effects on tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> knockdown on the expression of pam3csk <dig> and flagellin responsive genes a, based on rnaseq data, all the  <dig> pam3csk <dig> specific fold-changes are inhibited or down-regulated in tlr <dig> morphants  upon this pamp stimulation. b, based on rnaseq data, all the  <dig> flagellin specific fold-changes are inhibited or down-regulated in tlr5a morphants  upon this pamp stimulation. c, d, all the  <dig> common fold-changes are inhibited or down-regulated in tlr <dig> and tlr5a morphants. fc, fold-change. panel a, b, c, d: for the quantitative data and accession numbers of the shown genes  we refer to additional file 7: table s <dig> and additional file 6: table s3



discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the signaling pathways underlying recognition of pamps have been studied intensively and this has led to a broad understanding of key regulators of innate immunity based on studies of cell cultures and the use of knockout rodent mutants. the new possibilities for analysis of transcriptomes using rna deep sequencing make it highly attractive to analyze the responses of an entire test animal model at the system biology level. in this manuscript we have chosen the zebrafish embryo model for such an approach and have included functional analysis of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> in the response towards two well-known pamps, flagellin and pam3csk <dig> 

the results show that there is a relatively limited overlap between the transcriptome responses towards flagellin and pam3csk <dig> . the overlap includes well known downstream immune mediators that were previously shown to be induced by flagellin  <cit>  such as il1b, tnfa, irak <dig>  mmp <dig>  cxcl-c1c and il <dig>  in contrast, il <dig> and il <dig>  that are associated with an anti-inflammatory response, were induced much stronger by pam3csk <dig> than by flagellin. a relatively much larger group of genes showed a differential response to flagellin or pam3csk <dig>  including a group of genes of which the transcription is specific for activation by one of the two treatments .

go terms analysis of the genes specifically regulated by these two pamps show that there is an enriched category of transcription factors in the pam3csk4-specific group, of which most of genes are up-regulated and only one is down-regulated. additionally, a less enriched category of immune response genes is found in this group as well, which include a down-regulated crp . for the flagellin-specific group of genes, there are only five genes under the go-term regulation of transcription of which two are down-regulated. many of the genes specifically induced by pam3csk <dig> have also been shown to be strongly regulated by infection in the zebrafish embryo system  <cit>  and therefore we would like to further study this group of genes in more detail in future research.

for functional analysis of the transcriptome response towards flagellin and pam3csk <dig> we used morpholinos that were selected on basis of their blocking effect on downstream signaling using qpcr and subsequently confirmed by rnaseq analysis. surprisingly for tlr <dig> we found that a morpholino against each of the two copies of this gene, tlr5a and tlr5b had an effect on downstream signaling, with the tlr5a morpholino giving a complete block of induction of il1b by injection with flagellin and a partial effect of the tlr5b morpholino. these data suggests that these two tlr <dig> copies function in concert, perhaps by forming heterodimers.

an important question that comes from our work is how to explain the difference in gene sets that are regulated in response to pam3csk <dig> and flagellin?  since our detection system seems sufficiently sensitive to detect even minor effects on gene transcription, a limitation in dosing is not a likely explanation for this difference, so instead we think of another two possible alternative explanations. in the first place we could speculate that there are specific downstream signaling partners for tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  however, such partners have not yet been indicated by previous studies, in contrast, there are evidences that all known direct binding partners are common for both tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> proteins: including the adaptor proteins myd <dig>  and tirap  that have been implicated in signaling of both proteins  <cit> . furthermore, the functions of these genes in the direct recognition of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> ligands have not been tested yet in whole animal models. mutants for tirap have not been described yet in zebrafish making the specific function of this gene currently difficult to investigate. another possible explanation is that the differential response of zebrafish embryos to these two pamps is the result of an additive effect of the recognition by different cell types. in this case, the common group of activated downstream genes might be encoded by the response of common immune cells which have a full repertoire of tlr receptors whereas the specific response might be the result of a distinct transcriptional response of specialized cells that do not encode all tlr receptors. the detailed study of these transcription factors will provide valuable information on the specific immune transcriptional signatures elicited by different pathogens. for this purpose the genetic tractability of the zebrafish system will allow the generation of new reporter lines that will contribute to the understanding of how these responses modulate the innate immune system. in addition, such reporter lines will be of general interest since pam3csk <dig> and flagellin signaling pathways are broadly used to study the tlrs function in inflammatory microbial infection. furthermore, this signaling pathway is also relevant for studies of atherosclerosis and autoimmune diseases processes  <cit> . therefore the used systemic approach can be highly useful for future studies of a broad spectrum of immune-related diseases.fig.  <dig> specific and common responses to tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> ligands. the whole organism transcriptome response of zebrafish embryos to treatment with the tlr <dig> ligand pam3csk <dig> or the tlr <dig> ligand flagellin results in the induction of specific and common transcription factor genes as indicated in the figure. the common transcription factor genes , likely function upstream of the effector genes commonly induced by pam3csk <dig> and flagellin. the transcription factor genes induced by only one of the two ligands are likely to contribute to further specificity in the transcriptional responses of downstream effector genes
