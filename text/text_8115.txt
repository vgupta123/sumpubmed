BACKGROUND
the clinical outcomes of non-typhoidal salmonellosis range from self-limiting gastroenteritis to life-threatening systemic infections  <cit> . many serovars of salmonella enterica cause these infections, serovar enteritidis being among the most common  <cit> . the acute gastrointestinal infection caused by salmonella may result in complications such as reactive arthritis   <cit> . originally, rea was described as an aseptic inflammation that develops after an infection elsewhere in the body  <cit> . rea is an asymmetric polyarthritis and the outcome of the disease ranges from mild symptoms to severe and chronic clinical manifestations. up to 80% of patients with rea express the hla-b <dig> antigen  <cit> .

macrophages are important in the pathogenesis of salmonella infections. they are an integral part of the immune response as they present antigens to the innate defence system and communicate with the adaptive immune system to resist the bacterial infection  <cit> . however, unlike many other pathogens, salmonella can survive inside macrophages by adapting to this particular intracellular environmental niche. after salmonella uptake into macrophages, the intracellular bacteria reside in large membrane-bound phagosomes, called spacious phagosomes , which develop into salmonella-containing vacuoles   <cit> . the formation of sp or scv favours the survival and replication of salmonella in macrophages. even so, salmonella encounter intracellular host defence mechanisms, including reactive oxygen and nitrogen species , antimicrobial peptides, lysosomal enzymes, and adaptive immune responses  <cit> . in order to survive in the host and to avoid clearance by the host immune system, salmonella express virulence factors to deal with this stressful environment  <cit> .

many virulence genes of pathogenic bacteria are located in large multigene chromosome regions termed pathogenicity islands   <cit> . in salmonella, they are called salmonella pathogenicity islands   <cit> . two spis, spi- <dig> and spi- <dig>  encode structurally similar but functionally distinct type iii secretion systems , specialized protein export machineries that salmonella uses to deliver virulence proteins into the cytosol of host cells  <cit> . the spi-1-encoded t3ss is active extracellularly. spi- <dig> mediates invasion into non-phagocytic cells  <cit> , and it is required for the intestinal inflammatory responses  <cit> . the spi- <dig> virulence genes are expressed intracellularly and are required for the survival of bacteria in macrophages and systemic infections. spi- <dig> mutant strains are dramatically attenuated, showing a 104-fold reduction in virulence in ld <dig> in the murine salmonellosis model  <cit>  and impaired intracellular replication and survival in macrophages  <cit> .

hla-b <dig> confers a very strong genetic predisposition towards the development of a group of rheumatic disorders called spondyloarthropathies , including ankylosing spondylitis  and rea. hla-b27-positive individuals have a five-fold higher incidence of rea than the general population  <cit> . rea occurs following certain infections, e.g. those caused by salmonella and yersinia pathogens  <cit> . expression of hla-b <dig> also increases the risk that the patient will suffer a more severe and prolonged disorder  <cit> . the interaction between rea-triggering bacteria and hla-b27-positive subjects is abnormal and leads to increased persistence of the causative microbes/microbial antigens in hla-b27-positive patients  <cit> . the interaction between hla-b <dig> molecules and arthritogenic microbes was investigated more thoroughly using in vitro infected cells. experiments investigating the invasion of hla-b <dig> cells by gram-negative bacteria, including salmonella, are inconclusive. studies have shown either decreased  <cit>  or similar  <cit>  levels of invasion of hla-b27-transfected murine l fibroblasts compared with control l cell lines  or increased invasion of hla-b27-transfected intestinal epithelial henle- <dig> cells by salmonella  <cit> . once inside the host cells, salmonella is able to replicate more quickly  <cit> , and is eliminated more slowly, in hla-b27-positive cells  <cit>  than transfected control cells. the survival and persistence of salmonella in the intracellular environment is associated with bacterial gene expression  <cit> . however, little is known about salmonella gene expression in association with hla-b <dig> during bacterial infection and persistence.

RESULTS
cell surface expression of hla-b <dig> and hla-a <dig> molecules
the transfected hla-b <dig> and hla-a <dig> were always expressed on the surface of the respective cells, as detected by immunofluorescence in new batches of the cell lines . the level of expression of the transfected molecules in u <dig> cells was similar to that of hla-b <dig>  one of the mhc class i molecules endogenously expressed by u <dig> cells  <cit> . in addition, the surface expression levels of the transfected molecules corresponded to the levels of those molecules endogenously expressed on peripheral blood monocytes  <cit> .

increased replication of salmonella in hla-b27-positive u <dig> cells
we used the in vitro model of infection established earlier in our laboratory to monitor growth of s. enteritidis in macrophage-like u <dig> cells  <cit> . cells transfected with hla-b <dig> or hla-a <dig> were infected with complement-opsonized salmonellae. hla-a <dig> transfected cells were used as a negative control since it is a common tissue antigen that is not related to the development of rea  <cit> . at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h post infection, the host cells were lysed and the number of living intracellular bacteria per cell was determined by counting the number of colony forming units  . consistent with our previous results, no difference in the uptake of salmonella was observed between the two cell lines   <cit> . however, more bacteria were recovered from hla-b27-expressing cells than hla-a2-expressing cells at  <dig> h and even up to  <dig> h post infection, suggesting that hla-b27-transfected cells become permissive for intracellular salmonella survival and replication, which is also consistent with our previous studies  <cit> .

global gene expression profiles of s. enteritidis in hla-b27- and hla-a2-transfected u <dig> cells
the 'salsa' genomic salmonella serovar microarray containing  <dig> salmonella oligonucleotides was used to monitor gene expression in salmonella grown in the host cells  <cit> . gene expression was compared between salmonella grown in u <dig> cells and in lb broth. in total,  <dig>  genes of salmonella grown in hla-b <dig> cells and  <dig>  genes of salmonella grown in hla-a <dig> cells showed statistically significant differences in expression at  <dig> h post infection when compared to the transcriptome in lb broth culture. at  <dig> h post infection, the expression of  <dig>  genes of salmonella grown in hla-b <dig> cells and of  <dig>  genes of salmonella grown in hla-a <dig> cells showed statistically significant differences from salmonella grown in lb broth. the genes that showed significant expression differences and were up- or down-regulated more than two-fold for each individual comparison are listed in additional file 1: supplemental tables 1- <dig>  the categories of salmonella genes showing differential expression between hla-b <dig> cells and lb and between hla-a <dig> cells and lb at  <dig> h post infection can be found in figure.  <dig>  in particular, the functional categories analysis showed large differences in the expression of genes required for cell motility and secretion, flagellae and chemotaxis and oxidative phosphorylation. these differences in gene expression reflect bacterial adaptation to the intracellular environments.

to confirm the microarray data, quantitative real time rt-pcr was performed on six genes selected from different functional categories and showing differential up- or down-regulated expression between hla-b <dig> and a <dig> cells: mgtc, rpoe and ssag ; flic, fumc and nuoa  . rt-pcr was performed using the same bacterial rna from hla-b <dig> cells, a <dig> cells and lb broth, as was used in microarray experiments. it is important that the genes selected covered the whole scale of the microarray data from high expression level to medium and to low expression level, as well as in differential expression from high fold changes to low fold changes in u <dig> cells vs. in lb, among up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively. the quantity of cdna for each gene was obtained after normalization to the levels of rfah cdna, which was chosen as a control since rfah is expressed stably at moderate levels under most of the conditions tested . the rt-pcr results of the six genes studied were consistent with the microarray data , but due to the small number of genes studied with rt-pcr, data may be considered preliminary.

salmonella gene expression is regulated by hla-b <dig> at the  <dig> h time point
to determine whether bacterial gene expression plays a role in salmonella replication/persistence in hla-b <dig> cells, we assessed the transcriptome of s. enteritidis in the two cell lines. differential expression of the genes betweeen hla-b <dig> cells and hla-a <dig> cells is based on the comparison of the gene expression in hla-b <dig> cells to lb and the gene expression in hla-a <dig> cells to lb. for example, for the gene whose expression is 6-fold in hla-b <dig> cells compared to lb, and 2-fold in hla-a <dig> cells compared to lb, the expression is 3-fold in hla-b <dig> cells compared to hla-a <dig> cells. no genes showed significant differences when the transcriptomes of salmonella grown in hla-b27- and hla-a2-transfected cell lines were compared at  <dig> h post infection. this is consistent with the similarity observed in the intracellular growth of salmonella at this time point. in contrast,  <dig> genes showed significant differences in expression between salmonella grown in hla-b <dig> cells and in hla-a <dig> cells at  <dig> h post infection . bacterial gene expression reflects the environmental conditions in which the bacteria reside. the difference between bacteria grown in hla-b <dig> and hla-a <dig> cells suggests that hla-b <dig> modulates the intracellular environment and causes changes in salmonella gene expression during macrophage infection, resulting in increased survival and replication in hla-b <dig> cells. this modulation may be due to changes in host cell signalling pathways  <cit> . this is the first observation showing that salmonella gene expression is influenced by hla-b <dig>  the analysis of functional categories revealed that the groups of genes most altered in the presence of hla-b <dig> included those involved in salmonella virulence, dna replication, energy conversion and metabolism, and uptake and metabolism of nutrients.

α fdr  was set up during microarray data analysis.

up-regulation of spi- <dig> genes may prevent damage by ros
spi- <dig> genes have been shown to make salmonella capable of growing intracellularly by avoiding killing by reactive oxygen species   <cit> . during salmonella replication in macrophages, the innate defence systems of the host cells are triggered to limit the infection. ros produced by phagocyte nadph oxidase  are the most effective anti-bacterial agents  <cit> . nadph oxidase catalyzes the univalent reduction of molecular oxygen and produces superoxide, which has modest antibacterial activity but serves as a precursor for more toxic substrates, such as hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals  <cit> . compared to those grown in hla-a <dig> cells, salmonella grown in hla-b <dig> cells showed increased expression of spi- <dig> genes including ssan, ssao, ssar, ssas, ssav, ssca, ssei and ssph <dig> . spi- <dig> deficient mutants have impaired ability to grow in macrophages but are able to survive and are virulent within gp91phox knockout mice  <cit> . patients with x-linked gp91phox mutations  or gp91phox knockout mice that are unable to produce ros are extremely susceptible to bacterial infection, including those caused by salmonellae  <cit> . taken together, these findings indicated that spi- <dig> is required for survival in the presence of ros. the up-regulation of spi- <dig> genes in hla-b <dig> cells contributed to the increased intracellular growth and replication of salmonella.

intracellular growth of salmonella spi- <dig> mutants affected by hla-b27
to verify the significance of spi- <dig> genes in salmonella replication in hla-b <dig> cells, three genes most markedly up-regulated in hla-b <dig> cells - ssan, ssar and ssph <dig> - were deleted; ssan and ssar belong to the spi- <dig> secretion apparatus and ssph <dig> is an effector gene. the intracellular growth of the mutants was compared with that of wild-type s. enteritidis pt <dig> ks8822/ <dig>  mutation of ssar dramatically impaired intracellular salmonella growth in hla-b <dig> cells, decreasing it 19-fold at the  <dig> h and 33-fold at the  <dig> h time points . it has previously been shown that Δssar mutants cannot grow intracellularly in murine macrophages or form the elongated salmonella-induced filaments  in epithelial cells  <cit>  required for the formation of salmonella-containing vacuoles   <cit> . the formation and maintenance of scv promotes the survival and proliferation of bacteria in macrophages  <cit>  and the lack of formation of sifs by ssar mutants may account for the attenuation of this strain. the effector protein ssph <dig> is co-localized with vacuole-associated actin polymerization involved in the maintenance of scv membrane integrity  <cit> . the ssph <dig> mutant was also attenuated more than 4-fold in hla-b <dig> cells at both  <dig> and  <dig> hours after infection . unexpectedly, the mutant carrying the ssan deletion showed dramatically increased proliferation in hla-b <dig> cells:  <dig> -fold at the  <dig> h and  <dig> -fold at the  <dig> h time points . the increased growth of the ssan mutant in hla-b <dig> cells might indicate that this mutant has good fitness in hla-b27-positive u <dig> cells. the previous study by eriksson et al  <cit>  showed that the selection for s. typhimurium mutants performed in murine macrophage-like j774-a. <dig> cells provided bacterial variants capable of a selective downregulation of nitric oxide  expression. these variants showed increased host fitness. this is especially interesting, as in our model with murine l cells  <cit> , inos activity and no production were decreased in hla-b <dig> positive cells, which correlated with increased s. enteritidis growth. however, human u <dig> cells show very low inos activity and produce only small amounts of no in general, and no difference between hla-b27-positive and control cells was detected in this respect  <cit> . so the increased proliferation of the ssan mutant in hla-b <dig> cells, and no effect on growth in hla-a <dig> cells , perhaps indicates another specific and delicate relationship between ssan and hla-b <dig>  these observations demonstrated a delicate balance between bacterial growth and pathogenesis.

regulation of bacterial dna synthesis by hla-b27
as salmonella replicates more in hla-b27-transfected cells than in hla-a <dig> transfectants, it is not surprising that genes involved in dna synthesis are up-regulated in hla-b <dig> cells compared to hla-a <dig> cells. dna polymerase iii  holoenzyme is a major replicase responsible for dna synthesis  <cit> . it is a multiprotein complex containing over  <dig> distinct subunits. the α subunit encoded by dnae is one component of the catalytic core  of the pol iii holoenzyme and mutations affecting the α unit result in reduced growth of s. enteritica serovar typhimurium  <cit> . the expression of the gene dnae was induced  <dig> -fold in hla-b <dig> cells compared to hla-a <dig> cells at  <dig> h time point . other dna genes including dnaa encoding dna replication initial protein, dnab encoding putative replicative dna helicases, and dnan encoding β-subunit of dna polymerase iii were up-regulated  <dig> -,  <dig> -, and  <dig> -fold, respectively. however, dnaq encoding ε-subunit of dna polymerase iii was expressed at the similar level in two cell lines . the up-regulation of most dna genes in hla-b <dig> cells compared to hla-a <dig> cells might indicate more dna replication in hla-b <dig> cells. two genes  required for the production of the heterotetramer-dna gyrase were also up-regulated in hla-b <dig> cells compared with the control cells. dna gyrase is an essential enzyme for bacterial dna synthesis; it introduces negative supercoils into dna during replication  <cit> . the induction of gyra and gyrb perhaps indicates that more dna was synthesized by salmonella resulting in increased bacterial proliferation in hla-b27-transfected cells.

salmonella substrate and energy metabolism
growth in a nutrient-limited environment may be echoed in changes in gene expression. expression of genes involved in substrate and energy metabolism, including nuojkmn encoding nadh dehydrogenase i chains , cyocd encoding cytochrome o ubiquinol oxidase subunits iii and iv, and acef encoding a putative dehydrogenase was up-regulated in hla-b <dig> cells compared to hla-a <dig> cells. this suggests that more energy was produced in hla-b <dig> cells under aerobic conditions, which could be connected to the enhanced bacterial replication observed in hla-b <dig> cells  <cit> .

up-regulation of amino acid metabolism by salmonella growth in hla-b <dig> cells compared to hla-a <dig> cells was evident from the induction of gltb, gltd and glna encoding glutamate synthase/glutamine synthetase, and glngl encoding a two-component regulator of glutamine synthetase  <cit> . glutamate is an important precursor of other amino acids and of pyrimidine and purine synthesis in bacteria  <cit> . moreover, sugar catabolism genes such as acef, frua, fruf and pykf were elevated in hla-b <dig> cells. collectively, these data suggest that hla-b <dig> affects intracellular substrate metabolism and energy production by salmonella during infection of u <dig> cells, probably due to the increased bacterial proliferation in these cells.

hla-b <dig> modified ionic transport systems
magnesium is involved in the stabilisation of the cellular membrane and functions as a coenzyme. mgta and mgtb are two inducible transporters, and high up-regulation of mgtb and mgta in both hla-b <dig> and hla-a <dig> macrophages might suggest that mg2+ is extremely limited within the scv of infected u <dig> cells  <cit> . from  <dig> to  <dig> h after infection, the degree to which these two genes were up-regulated was increased in both cell lines, indicating that the amounts of magnesium decreased during the course of infection. mgtc is also involved in mg2+ transport in the intracellular survival of salmonella and other bacteria in macrophages  <cit> . the two genes mgtc and mgtb are located in one operon, mgtcb, which belongs to spi- <dig> on the salmonella chromosome  <cit> . our data showed that both mgtc and mgtb were less induced in hla-b27-positive cells than in hla-b27-negative cells, suggesting that hla-b <dig> modulates the acquisition of mg2+ in macrophages.

phosphate availability is limited in macrophage vacuoles  <cit> . these observations are supported by our microarray data showing that the phobr regulon, the pstc and psts genes responsible for phosphate uptake and/or transport, were up-regulated during intracellular growth. the genes were induced to similar levels in both cell lines at  <dig> h after infection but the expression of pstc was down-regulated in hla-b <dig> cells compared to hla-a <dig> cells at  <dig> h postinfection. taken together, these results suggest that hla-b <dig> affects the intracellular ionic status of the scv.

CONCLUSIONS
we have elucidated the global gene expression profile of s. enteritidis pt <dig> ks8822/ <dig> during intracellular growth in human monocyte/macrophages for the first time. the gene expression profile shown by s. enteritidis during intracellular growth is very different from that exhibited in lb broth. however, it is similar to the patterns of gene expression reported for s. typhimurium bacterial intracellular growth in macrophages  <cit> . approximately one quarter of s. enteritidis genes showed up- or down-regulation in host cells compared to lb broth. among the genes up-regulated intracellularly were spi- <dig> virulence genes, nutrient acquisition system genes, and ionic uptake and/or synthesis genes. similar differences in intracellular s. typhimurium gene expression were also seen between macrophages and medium in vitro  <cit> . spi- <dig> genes are broadly induced to evade immune responses by host cells. acquisition and transport system genes were elevated to take up the necessary elements. among the down-regulated genes, some were related to central metabolism, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, indicating that the level of oxygen is extremely low in the scv intracellular environment, which seems contrary to the observation of intracellular s. typhimurium growth  <cit> . also, salmonella metabolism and energy production were slower intracellularly than during growth in lb medium. these changes reflect the intracellular environment that the bacteria encounter during infection of macrophages  <cit> .

the survival and proliferation of pathogens within macrophages is critical for establishing systemic infection, and this process is related to bacterial gene expression  <cit> . the expression of hla-b <dig> in the u <dig> cells appeared to generate a favourable environment for intracellular salmonella growth compared with hla-a2-transfected cells, resulting in more bacteria in hla-b27-transfected cells. the increased ability of salmonella to survive is probably due to the altered gene expression. the expression of  <dig> genes at  <dig> h after infection differed significantly between hla-b <dig> cells and hla-a <dig> cells, suggesting that hla-b <dig> modified salmonella gene expression and/or affected the intracellular bacterial growth environment during the infection of macrophages. expression of spi- <dig> genes, which play a key role in the increased persistence of salmonella in macrophages, was up-regulated in hla-b <dig> cells compared to hla-a <dig> cells. dna replication, energy production and nutrient metabolism were also increased, suggesting that more bacterial physiological activities occurred in hla-b <dig> cells. this is consistent with the increased replication and survival of salmonella in hla-b27-transfected macrophages. interestingly, expression of many spi- <dig> genes, energy production and nutrient metabolism are also increased in epithelial cells where salmonella replicates intracellularly  <cit> , whereas e.g. cyo and cyd terminal oxidases, which use oxygen exclusively as terminal acceptor, are strongly downregulated in salmonella inhabiting restrictive cells, fibroblasts  <cit>  and hla-a <dig> cells .

mutagenesis of the spi- <dig> genes demonstrated the crucial role of spi- <dig> in the survival and replication of salmonella in hla-b <dig> cells, as has been seen in other macrophages  <cit> . the intracellular replication and survival of the strains bearing deletion of either ssar or ssph <dig> was impaired in comparison with wild-type pt <dig> . both proteins participate in the maintenance of the scv membrane, which is important for the survival of salmonella in infected macrophages. increased growth of the ssan mutant in hla-b27-positive cells might indicate a special connection between this mutant and hla-b27-positive cells, and may even be relevant to the pathogenesis of hla-b27-associated rea.

hla-b <dig> modifies the host cell's signalling pathways during salmonella infection. our group recently demonstrated that mitogen activated protein kinase  p <dig> is involved in salmonella replication in u <dig> cells, and that the p <dig> mapk pathway is deregulated in hla-b27-transfected cells  <cit> . salmonella uses type iii secretion systems  encoded in spi- <dig> or - <dig> to deliver virulence proteins into host cells, which subsequently interfere with the host cell's signalling pathways  <cit> . further experiments will be required to determine how salmonella genes, particularly spi- <dig> genes, affect intracellular signalling pathways and cause increased replication of bacteria in hla-b <dig> cells. nevertheless, these findings give new insights into the disturbed microbe-host interaction in hla-b27-positive cells.
