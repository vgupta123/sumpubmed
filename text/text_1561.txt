BACKGROUND
given the complexity of gene regulatory networks, knowledge of the properties of individual components in the network are not sufficient to elucidate the cell physiology. thus systems biology has evolved to uncover "emergent properties" that arise from the intricate interactions of gene networks. one such emergent property, "switch-like behavior" or "bistability", describes a dynamic feature of a particular gene  <cit>  to preferentially toggle between two steady-states. multiple steady states are often observed in chemical and biochemical reactions  and are characterized by a non-linear response. bistability happens to be a special case involving two steady-states, giving rise to a "switch-like behavior". in biochemical reactions, such "bistable" behavior shows a sharp sigmoid function or a hysteresis structure , whereby the state of the variable flips between high and low levels. such an "all-or-none" state transition usually depends on a threshold, i.e., the concentration of the stimulator or regulator. hysteresis depends further on the previous state of the system.

the expression level of a gene switch does not change gradually but rather has two distinct steady-states: high or low, on or off, all or none. the ability of switches to convert a graded signal into a binary response ensures that a cell responds in a decisive manner or unambiguously commit to a specific program  <cit> . furthermore switches have been noted for their noise-filtering capacity. endogenous noise are typically lower for fully repressed or induced expression states than in a gene where the state changes continuously  <cit> .

bistable behavior of gene switches have been reported to play pivotal roles in many important aspects of cell physiology, including cell fate decisions, cell cycle control, and cellular responses to environmental stimulation  <cit> . e. coli lac operon is a famous gene switch that uses a hysteretic feedback to decide between glucose and lactose utilization  <cit> . many bistable systems have been discovered in bacteria, including the genetic transformation in bacilius subtillis and sporulation in many bacterial species  <cit> . in mammalian systems, gene switches and bistability have been postulated as the underlying mechanism for cellular differentiation, but rarely has this been confirmed experimentally, until recently with the work on neutrophil differentiation  <cit> . another interesting observation is that cells have "memory", and hysteresis has been shown to govern short-term memory in lymphoid cells, preserving information of past encounters with antigen  <cit> . thus, the discovery of gene switches in cellular responses has become a milestone in molecular biology and prompt strong interest in understanding the function and design of gene networks  <cit> .

despite the importance of gene switches, identifying multiple steady-states, and in particular switches, has been difficult. our understanding of gene switches has been mostly based on simulations of generic feedback circuits and well-characterized biological modules  <cit> . theoretical studies of feedback circuits have elucidated general principles of network dynamics, but they usually lack solid evidence to associate these principles with real physiological processes in cells. few studies have succeeded in demonstrating functional roles of actual switches in biological systems by coupling detailed kinetic modeling with rigorous experimentation  <cit> . this is because well-characterized models with equations and kinetic parameters are difficult to obtain for real, complex biological systems, in part because current techniques are not able to quantitatively measure reaction constants at the single-cell resolution for all the network components. alternatively, researchers in synthetic biology have designed artificial gene networks with specific functions and implemented the interactions by manipulating or bringing together exogenous genetic components  <cit> . thus current methods of experimentally studying switches have been limited to well-characterized or synthetic small modules.

switches play a central role in cell decision, and the ability to predict whether switches can occur without a priori detail information of the network would be significant. for instance, the ability to identify which genes are turned on or off in cancer versus normal cells would have a tremendous impact on identifying the most pertinent molecular signatures or targets for drug therapy. therefore a major challenge confronting the field, which we address in this study, is how to effectively identify gene switches or bistable states by mining high-throughput data.

previous approaches addressed this question by analyzing the network topology. these studies assume that bistability requires particular feedback structures  <cit> , and discovered dynamic features by searching for these structures  in protein-protein interaction and protein-dna interaction networks  <cit> . however, these feedback structures do not ensure switch-like behavior. from modeling and simulations of genetic circuits, positive feedback  has been shown to be neither necessary  <cit>  nor sufficient  <cit>  to ensure switch-like behavior. furthermore, it is less likely that one can uncover a dynamic property from static networks.

alternatively, we theorize that the dynamic "behavior" of a switch could be identified by analyzing the gene expression profiles from a wide range of conditions. we propose a top-down mining approach to identify gene switches from microarray gene expression data. taking advantage of the tremendous amount of expression data, our approach aims to identify bimodality, which we hypothesize is an essential characteristic of a gene switch. we perform theoretical analysis and provide proof-of-concept applications on both synthetic and yeast microarray datasets. we further apply our methodology on an integrated human expression dataset to probe the characteristic signatures of human cancer and confirm that our approach is able to identify a gene with switch-like behavior. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at applying mining approaches to explore gene switches on a genome-scale.

since the state of gene switches in the genetic network governs the phenotype  <cit> , we postulate that recognizing specific gene switches will enable one to identify biomarkers or molecular signatures that would be better drug targets for treating a disease. we demonstrate the utility of our mining approach in human breast cancer by analyzing a paired breast cancer/normal tissue expression dataset against the integrated human gene expression dataset. we uncover two types of potential gene switches in breast cancer, with one type  showing bimodality within the breast cancer and a second type  showing predominantly one modality in breast cancer.

known therapeutic targets for breast cancer are uncovered under the type  <dig> genes, such as estrogen receptor  and human epidermal growth factor receptor  <dig> , which are identified as gene switches for this cancer, and their bimodality in the cancer samples represent well-known subtypes in breast cancer. the other type of gene switch shows predominantly one modality in the breast cancer samples, and is where we discover the tacstd <dig>  gene. the expression of tacstd <dig> is turned off in most normal samples but on in almost all of the breast cancer samples independent of the subtypes. we predict through sequence matching of transcription factor  sites that creb could regulate tacstd <dig>  thereby implicating a novel transcriptional mechanism by which tacstd <dig> is regulated. our experimental studies on multiple breast cancer cell lines confirm the switch-like behavior of tacstd <dig> and provide evidences for the transcriptional regulation of the gene. these results demonstrate the ability of our mining approach to identify gene switches that could be candidate biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets in breast cancer.

RESULTS
a gene switch has two steady states, which will produce a bimodal distribution in its expression profile when sampled across different conditions. figures 1-a and 1d show the gene network topology of two typical regulatory circuits that exhibit bistable behavior. figure 1-a is a positive self-feedback transcriptional system under the control of a transcriptional repressor. figure 1-d is a double-negative feedback system, also known as a toggle switch, which produces mutually exclusive activation of two genes. both circuits have been synthesized and implemented in cell systems  <cit>  to confirm their switching behavior. simulations based on the kinetic models of these systems  <cit>   confirm the on/off and toggle-like switching behavior in their response curve  and state space . by simulating random samples from a wide range of conditions with different initial states, this unique feature of two distinct steady-states of gene switches results in a gene expression histogram profile containing two modes . this bimodality is observed despite the noise  imposed on the parameters.

a challenge in experimentally identifying gene switches is their population effect. in single cell experiments, if obtainable, the response curves would represent individual cell measurements, and a gene that switches will exhibit a steep jump between the steady states . however many biological measurements , including microarray analysis, provide the population-average. in fact, even with single cell measurements, individual clones can contribute cell-cell variances, with differences in the protein expression levels across different cells. in figure 1-h the cell-cell variance is modeled by a gaussian distribution in the protein expression and different cells in a clone would then respond differently to stimulation, leading to a continuous change in the averaged response curve . this explains, in part, the difficulty in identifying switches through standard experiments.

we proposed that an unbiased sampling across a range of different conditions could address this issue and help reveal the dynamic feature of gene switches. in figure 1-i we show analytically, potential response-curves  in the whole state space of a gene switch. each sample within the system would asymptotically approach one of the two possible steady states . since the on/off states are the steady states which most cells will concentrated in upon stimulation, the samples will have higher probability of staying in these states, leading to a bimodal distribution in the observed expression profiles. we use a Δaic value  to capture whether a gene is likely to show multistable behavior. compare with simpler criteria, such as separation and kurtosis  <cit> , Δaic is more reliable and more resistance to noisy data . the Δaic value is computed by comparing the goodness of fit of the data to either a gaussian mixture model or a single gaussian model, and assesses whether a bimodal distribution can explain the data better.

a proof-of-concept application of the e2f-rb network
the e2f-rb network is a well-characterized system in mammalian cell fate determination, whereby the retinoblastoma  protein regulates the transcriptional factor, e2f, to control the restriction point for the g1-s transition in cell cycle  <cit> . a simplified kinetic model was constructed for the e2f-rb system  <cit> , in which two genes myc and cycd  are activated by sufficient growth signal  to induce e2f activation, which then directs the synthesis of downstream factors, such as cyce for dna replication. the e2f self-activation and cyce-mediated e2f activation constitute two positive feedbacks in the system. it then was experimentally  <cit>  confirmed that the level of e2f switches on or off for cell-proliferation and cell-cycle arrest, respectively, suggesting e2f acts as a gene switch, while cycd and myc do not show such switch-like behaviors.

we perform simulations based on the kinetic model  <cit>  to generate a synthetic gene-expression dataset. the stimulation-response curve of a single-cell is shown in figure 2-a, and confirms a graded response for myc/cycd and bistable dynamics for e2f. the downstream factor cyce, controlled by e2f, also shows a switch-like response. introducing a distribution in the expression level to represent cell-cell variation within a clone, and averaging multiple simulations  shows that population averaging for any one condition disguises the switch-like behavior and is indistinguishable from a graded responses, which is consistent with previous rt-pcr experiments  <cit> .

we then simulate  <dig> cell clones, each clone with a random initial condition, and measure the steady state expression level of the network components for each clone. in this way we synthetically generate  <dig> "microarrays" for  <dig> different conditions. it is clear genes that have two steady states, i.e. e2f and cyce , exhibit two distinct modes in their expression profiles . each gene's Δaic value is calculated from the synthetic expression data and the switches exhibit higher Δaic values than the non-switches. thus Δaic can be used to rank and help uncover genes that are bistable.

a proof-of-concept application to yeast microarray data
we apply our mining approach to an integrated yeast microarray dataset containing  <dig> yeast experiments  and calculate the Δaic value for each gene in the dataset. with such a large set of conditions, the Δaic value is fairly robust . a histogram of the Δaic value among the yeast genes is shown in figure 3-a. most genes have low Δaic, and their expression appear unimodal. however, a few genes have high Δaic values and clearly show bimodality.

the genes with high Δaic values have distinct states under different conditions. by collating and comparing those conditions under the two distinct expression states, one can potentially identify the phenotypes in which the genes are functioning. given that a phenotypic ontology is not available, it is difficult to compare conditions. nevertheless, one approach is to categorize conditions by the type of perturbations, e.g. heat shock , hypo-osmotic shock , and extra carbon sources , etc., and check if one of the two states of a putative switch is enriched within a category of conditions. using this approach, we correctly uncovered genes that have switch-like behavior, namely gal <dig>  gal <dig>  gal <dig> and gal <dig> . these genes all have Δaic values that rank among the top 5% and show bimodality, with one of their two modes containing conditions from the same category, i.e. "adding extra carbon sources". the bimodal profiles show that by adding 2%  extra carbon sources into the media, with the exception of galactose as the extra carbon source, the expression of these four genes shut down. it has been reported that these four genes function in the same pathway for galactose utilization, i.e., the well-known "gal genetic switch" . the addition of alternative carbon sources results in "glucose-repression" of the gal pathway. during this process, the high level of glucose or other carbon sources  induces the formation of the repressor complex  and upon its binding to specific upstream repressing sequences  on the gal promoters, it prevents the activation of these four gal genes by the transcription factor gal <dig>  thereby turning off the galatose utilization pathway.

current knowledge on the existence and functional machinery of other gene switches is limited. however we show next that by integrating information of the regulatory network and proteomic data, the genes with high Δaic obtained from our analysis could be possible switches or at least important genes with respect to the phenotypes. we calculate the Δaic values of transcription factors in the yeast transcriptional regulatory network , and observe that the leaf-nodes --- genes that are only regulated by one factor and are not regulating any other transcription factors ---- tend to have significantly lower Δaic value . these genes which have few regulators and do not transcriptionally control transcription factors are less likely to have feedbacks at the transcriptional level, and therefore switching dynamics. thus the dynamic property we infer of the molecular components within a network is contingent on the network organization.

next, we analyze single-cell proteomic data that includes noise in the protein expression measurements. we find a weak but significant negative correlation between the Δaic value of a gene and its coefficient of variation, which captures the noise of its protein expression . this suggests that genes with higher Δaic value, showing bimodality, tend to express relatively lower levels of noise. this observation that genes with lower expression noise under normal conditions are more tightly controlled highlights their importance in the network, and is consistent with previous suggestions that gene switches have noise-filtering capacity  <cit> .

the application in human microarray data: identifying cancer molecular targets
we further apply the mining approach to an integrated human gene expression dataset  which collated  <dig> microarray experiments performed on the same platform, across a wide range of conditions and cell types, including normal human tissues, carcinoma cells and tissues, hematopoietic cells, and other diseases.

a similar Δaic distribution  is obtained where only a few genes show bimodality. for example in figure 4-a, we compare the histograms of expression levels of two genes, dtl, which is bimodal and ranked 32nd in terms of differential expression, and snrpe, which is unimodal and ranked 6th. dtl, however, shows a bimodal distribution with respect to cancer/noncancer  and is more predictive based upon information gain , indicating the prediction of the cancer phenotype based on dtl is slightly better than snrpe. this is consistent with previous studies where dtl was reported as an essential regulator of the early g2-m checkpoints  <cit> , and assumes important roles in cell cycle progression and differentiation  <cit> . dtl has been suggested as a gene marker for breast  <cit>  and prostate cancers  <cit> , while the snrpe gene has not been reported to be associated with cancer. moreover, among the top  <dig> most differentially expressed genes for distinguishing the cancer/non-cancer phenotypes, those with higher Δaic values provide more information . figure 4-b shows the correlations between Δaic value and the information gain for the top  <dig> most differentially expressed genes and suggests that bimodality could be a relevant feature in identifying potential molecular targets.

this large integrated dataset  <cit>  provides a sampling of the state-space of the gene network, and interestingly, the p <dig> gene , reported to be up-regulated in response to dna damage  <cit>  shows bimodality. this information cannot readily be obtained from comparing the expression data from just two conditions, normal and γ-irradiation  <cit>  for instance . recent single cell measurements with high temporal resolution observed p <dig> pulses with fixed amplitude and duration, suggesting an on/off rapid switching in the p <dig> dynamics  <cit> . although p <dig> is regulated coordinately on multiple levels , our analysis of bimodality provide evidence to support a possible switching dynamics of p <dig> at the transcriptional level.

identify characteristic signatures of human breast cancer
we analyze a paired breast cancer/normal tissue expression dataset   <cit>  against the integrated human gene expression dataset  <cit>  to identify characteristic signatures of human breast cancer. first, we calculate the separation value d  <cit>  for the top 10% ranked genes by Δaic to examine whether the expressions of these genes are bimodal when comparing the breast cancer  samples against all other phenotypes . biologically this indicates whether a gene potentially shows bistability and could be involved in the "switching" or transition to a breast cancer phenotype. d >  <dig> has been suggested to indicate whether the separation into two gaussian distributions or modes is distinctive  <cit> . considering the large amount of noise in the microarray data, we accept separation values of greater than or close to  <dig>  to indicate bimodality, which results in  <dig> genes showing distinct bimodality in breast cancer.

next, an independent microarray dataset  with  <dig> paired breast cancer samples of diverse histopathological characteristics is analyzed to test if the  <dig> genes are expressed differently and show distinct bimodality in breast tumor as compared to normal breast tissues. comparing such "local" expression profile  with the "global" expression profile  identified that of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes  show bimodality in both datasets . one type of genes is bimodal within the breast cancer samples, herein denoted type  <dig>  with estrogen receptor-alpha  having the highest separation. the other type of gene switch shows predominantly one modality within the breast cancer samples, herein denoted as type  <dig>  and is where we find the tacstd <dig>  gene having the highest separation value within this group.

many of the genes that show type  <dig> bimodal behavior also exhibit the biomdality within the breast cancer samples . known therapeutic targets for breast cancer, such as esr <dig>  erbb <dig>  and erbb <dig> , are identified as showing bimodality in their gene expression level in breast cancer. their bimodality in the cancer samples represents well-known subtypes in breast cancer, i.e. er+/er- and her2+/her2- subtypes. esr <dig>  is a well-known transcription factor involved in the development and progression of breast cancer. previous immunohistochemical analysis showed a bimodal distribution in estrogen receptors  expression ---- the majority of breast cancer patients express either er-negative  or unambiguously er-positive , of which  are er+, while moderate er immunostaining is rarely observed  <cit> . this supports our discovery of bimodality of the esr <dig> gene expression within the breast cancer samples. it has been a decade since researchers attempted to explore the mechanism underlying such an all-or-none expression pattern of estrogen receptors. it was previously reported that the esr promoter activity is increased by co-transfection of the wild-type esr expression vector, suggesting a positive contribution of esr to its own expression  <cit> . a recent study uncovered that mir- <dig> is involved in a forward feedback loop that regulates esr <dig> expression, whereby esr <dig> enhances mir- <dig> expression and mir- <dig> targets and reduces the expression level of rasd <dig>  gene, which is a transcriptional inhibitor of esr <dig>  <cit> . these studies provide evidence of a potential positive-feedback  induced bistability of the esr <dig> expression, as shown in figure 6-a, where the topology is similar to the toggle-switch design in figure 1-d. erbb <dig> and erbb <dig> interact with each other and are known to be transcriptionally regulated by esr <dig>  <cit> . a recent study  <cit>  identified a positive feedback of erbb <dig> through the transcription factor c-jun, which could provide a potential explanation for the bimodality observed for erbb <dig>  as shown in figure 6-b.

the molecular characterization of the type  <dig> genes  suggests the development of therapies for er+/pr+ and her2+ would be effective for these breast cancer subtypes, however ~15-20% of the breast cancer tissues expressing low levels of these biomarkers  have poor prognosis and few treatment options. moreover, patients that are responsive to commonly used drugs, such as tamoxifen  and trastuzumab , eventually acquire resistance to the drugs. ~30% of tamoxifen-responsive tumors become resistant  <cit> , and the resistance invariably ensues at some point with trastuzumab. given the increase in resistance to drugs that target the esr receptor alternative therapeutic targets are needed.

the second type of potential gene switch, herein denoted as type  <dig>  shows unimodal behavior in the breast cancer tissue  and is differentially expressed in almost all the paired breast tumor/normal tissues as compared with non-breast cancer samples. the top gene showing this type of switching behavior is tacstd <dig> . type  <dig> gene switches uncovered by our analysis show a distinct state in the breast cancer samples, and could be a potential biomarker or drug target that does not rely on the esr receptor. we characterized the tacstd <dig> gene, and found it to be distinctively expressed at higher levels in almost all of the breast cancer samples, er+/-, her2+/- subtypes . we confirm that the expression of tacstd <dig> gene is high in breast cancer cell lines mcf <dig> and mda-mb- <dig>  as compared with non-cancer cells .

currently little is known about the regulation of tacstd <dig>  promoter analysis  identified creb as a potential transcription factor that regulates the expression of tacstd <dig>  we observe a significant increase in the correlation between the expression level of creb and tacstd <dig> in the breast cancer samples. the correlation coefficients in the normal breast tissue are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  for the three creb probes in the affymetrix array, and the correlation coefficients in the breast tumor tissues are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , respectively, suggesting creb could regulate tacstd <dig> 

to assess the possible switching behavior and regulation by creb of tacstd <dig>  we performed flow cytometry to probe the tacstd <dig> protein level at single-cell resolution. for both mcf10a and mcf <dig> breast cell lines the tacstd <dig> protein level shows a bimodal distribution in their cell population , which is a property of a bistable system. we stimulated the cells with fi  to induce camp, which is an activator of creb  <cit> , and measured the tacstd <dig> levels. both tacstd <dig> mrna and protein levels increased significantly upon stimulation , thereby supporting a possible transcriptional regulation by creb. upon activation of tacstd <dig> by fi, a decrease in one of the modes with a concomitant increase in the other mode, instead of a gradual increase in the protein level,  is indicative of a switching behavior. the activation essentially increases the number of cells with tacstd <dig> levels at the on state and decreases the cells with tacstd <dig> at the off level. in contrast, the expression of the tacstd <dig> protein in primary rat astrocytes shows a unimodal expression under the same test conditions. furthermore stimulation of astrocytes by fi leads to a non-significant change in the protein level and with the cells predominantly remaining in the off steady-states .

the activation of tacstd <dig> has been suggested to transduce calcium signal, likely by mediating calcium release from intracellular stores  <cit> . it has been shown that the cross-linking  of the tacstd <dig> gene leads to a significant rise in the cytoplasmic calcium  level  <cit> . the release of calcium can activate creb  <cit>  and the mapk/erk pathway  <cit>  through calmodulin-dependent protein kinases . indeed it is reported  <cit>  in murine system that a high level of tacstd <dig> can activate mapk signaling to induce c-fos and ap- <dig>  this results in elevated levels of cycd <dig> and cyce as well as reduced levels of the cdk inhibitor, p <dig>  which together can de-regulate and promote cell proliferation  <cit> .

in light of these studies, our analysis uncovered tacstd <dig> gene to have a switch-like behavior, with creb as a possible regulator, which is activated in breast cancer and modulates the transcription of tacstd <dig>  creb can provide a positive feedback in the transcriptional regulation of tacstd <dig> , to thereby support a bimodal distribution in tacstd <dig> expression and possible bistable behavior.

discussion
mining approach to identify gene switches
researchers recognized that "genetic switches" behave in a discrete manner, but this feature is usually lost in biochemical analysis of large cell populations due to the difficulty in distinguishing between changes in the proportion of cells and their expression level in the two states  <cit> . for example, it is hard to determine from population measurements whether the expression level of a gene increases gradually by 70%, or whether 70% of the cells are "switched" on. in this study, we provide an alternative approach to identifying possible gene switches by capitalizing upon the large amount of available microarray data. the large sample set enables the characterization of the state space by uncovering the presence of the two attractor-states where the majority of the samples should fall. thus, if an on/off switch behavior exists in a system the state space will show bimodality or bistability, which are relatively stable with respect to perturbations  <cit> . it has been suggested that bistability or multiple steady states  <cit>  exists in large gene networks  <cit> , and these attractor-states represent different phenotypes  <cit> . thus, by sampling across different conditions, which are less affected by population averaging, one can reveal this dynamic feature of regulatory networks.

our mining approach demonstrates that in the absence of a priori knowledge of the specific network architecture, one can capitalize on genome-wide expression profiling to capture dynamic properties of a complex network.

meta-analysis of expression data
the increase in publically available microarray repositories provides a tremendous potential for data mining to unravel knowledge of cellular processes. current approaches that integrate and analyze the wealth of expression data continues to emerge. the concept of "meta-analysis" comes from statistics and has been extended to integrate analysis of expression data. however most of the current studies have focused on database comparison, integration, and clustering  <cit> . furthermore, the statistical analysis of combining datasets of differentially expressed genes  <cit>  have been used primarily to enhance the statistical power, i.e. reducing false discovery rate, as oppose to providing insight into the biological mechanisms.

our study provides a different perspective that takes advantage of the large integrated set of expression data, and suggests a mechanism-based framework to perform the meta-analysis. this approach of integrating microarray data from a diverse set of conditions provides a common "context" of gene behaviors, whereby one can obtain a better understanding of the specific function of a gene for a particular condition under investigation. the example of p <dig> expression, shown in figure 4-c is a case in point. p <dig> is known to be a major regulator in response to dna damage  <cit> , however it is difficult to identify from a small set of microarray experiment  since it does not appear in the top ranked differentially expressed genes . this is likely due to its multi-level regulation  and also the lack of appropriate control conditions in the experiment. nevertheless, by comparing the small set of samples against the global expression of the integrated dataset provides a "context", whereby one observes a significant reduction in the variance in expression within the small set of microarray experiment , and suggests tightly-controlled regulation of this gene in dna damage response.

although p <dig> has both switching and oscillation dynamic features  <cit> , we only discovered and discussed its switching property with our novel approach. our approach identifies switch-like behavior based on the bimodal distribution induced by the feature of bistability. oscillatory dynamics could have multiple  steady states and furthermore, the cells in the microarray experiments are not necessarily synchronized according to the periodic feature of the oscillation dynamics being investigated, thereby making it difficult to uncover this type of dynamics. our approach is designed to discover gene switches and currently cannot be directly apply to identify oscillatory dynamics.

tacstd <dig> is an attractive candidate for drug therapy of breast cancer
our mining approach uncovered a unique expression pattern of tacstd <dig> in breast cancer, and experiments confirmed tacstd <dig> show bimodal behavior in breast cancer cell lines. tacstd <dig>  is a cell surface glycoprotein, first discovered to be highly expressed in trophoblast cells that become invasive and metastasized to form the outer layer of blastocyst in embryo development  <cit> . recent studies, along with our analysis of breast cancer samples, found tacstd <dig> to be highly expressed in a variety of epithelial cancers and show low to no expression in normal somatic cells. high expression of tacstd <dig> in squamous-cell carcinoma  <cit> , pancreatic  <cit> , colorectal  <cit>  and gastric  <cit>  cancers have been associated with poor prognosis and higher incidence of metastasis and death. tacstd <dig> was identified as an oncogene in colorectal cancer cells  <cit> . although not essential for cell proliferation under normal condition, ectopic expression of tacstd <dig> enhances anchorage-independent cell growth, promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis in colon cancer cells. knock-down or inhibition of the protein reduces the invasiveness of aggressive colon cancer cells  <cit> . in our analysis we also found tacstd <dig> to be highly expressed in many colon cancer samples and shows bimodality , however the percentage of colon cancer samples with tacstd <dig> at the on state  are less than in breast cancer , suggesting tacstd <dig> could be a better target for breast cancer.

in previous microarray analysis of breast tumors,  <cit>  huang et al. studied "aggregate patterns of gene expression" with respect to lymph node status and recurrence, and identified "metagenes" that could predict the outcomes of the patients. tacstd <dig> is found among the metagenes in their list; however the list consists of more than a hundred genes with potential predictive value. in contrast, we find the tacstd <dig> gene to be the top gene in the list  that shows the type  <dig> behavior. interestingly, the distinctive high/low expression level of the tacstd <dig> gene has been implicated as a marker for stem cell characteristics in prostate basal cells  <cit>  and hepatic oval cells  <cit> . the prostate basal cells and hepatic oval cells, considered progenitor cells, show high expression of the tacstd <dig> gene and maintain self-renewal capability  <cit> , and thereby implicating a potential role of tacstd <dig> in cancer initiating stem cells.

although tacstd <dig> has been reported to be associated with cancer, the regulatory mechanism of tacstd <dig> remains unclear. combining computational prediction and experimental analysis, we found that creb could regulate tacstd <dig> in breast cancer cells, and suggest a potential feedback structure of tacstd <dig> regulation . to the best of our knowledge, this is the first regulatory circuit discovered to control tacstd <dig> expression.

studies of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells found these cells develop altered activation of creb and ap- <dig>  <cit> , which we speculate could be related to tacstd <dig> signaling. trastuzumab resistance in her2+ breast cancer cells is reported to involve elevated cyce expression level which is associated with the desensitization of p <dig> regulation  <cit> . given that tacstd <dig> could increase cyce level by inhibiting p <dig>  it provides a possible mechanistic connection with the tacstd <dig> gene as a potential target for erbb2/her <dig> regulation and trastuzumab resistance .

overall, our computational analysis demonstrate a distinctively high expression of tacstd <dig> in almost all er+/-, her2+/- subtypes of breast cancer. experiment shows that tacstd <dig> expression is high in breast cancer cell lines, mcf- <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> , and fi treatment enhances the expression of tacstd <dig> . comparing mcf- <dig>  and mda-mb- <dig>  cells, many more cells in the mda-mb- <dig> than in the mcf- <dig> cell line have tacstd <dig> in the on state . in fact most cells in the mda-mb- <dig> cell line have tacstd <dig> turned on. this observation, together with the information extracted from the microarray data , highlights tacstd <dig> as an important biomarker for both er+ and er- breast cancer subtypes, as well as an attractive candidate for drug therapy against the triple negative  and her2-) subtype of breast cancer, with potential implications for treating drug-resistant cases that are non-responsive to er/her2-targeted therapies. in addition, the presence of tacstd <dig> on the cell surface makes it more accessible to antibody-based therapeutics.

CONCLUSIONS
we propose a top-down mining approach to exploring gene switches on a genome-scale level. our mining approach demonstrates that in the absence of a priori knowledge of the specific network architecture, one can capitalize on genome-wide expression profiling to capture dynamic properties of a complex network. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in applying mining approaches to explore gene switches on a genome-scale. by applying the computational analysis on human microarray data, we uncovered a unique expression pattern of tacstd <dig> in breast cancer, and experiments confirmed tacstd <dig> show bimodal behavior in breast cancer cell lines, further, our perturbation study suggest a potential bistable mechanism is involved. to the best of our knowledge, this is a first case a single cell level bimodality and bistability can be predicted from microarray data. combining our computational and experimental analysis, together with previous studies in the literature, we suggest tacstd <dig> could be an attractive candidate for drug therapy against both er+ and er- subtypes, including possibly the triple negative  and her2-) subtype of breast cancer, and finally with potential implications for treating drug-resistant cases that are non-responsive to er/her2-targeted therapies.
