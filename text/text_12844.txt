BACKGROUND
a number of mg2+ transport proteins have been identified in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms . the bacterial cora mg2+ channel includes two transmembrane segments   <cit> . homologs of cora, termed alr proteins, were found in the plasma membrane of yeast  <cit> . human mrs <dig>  a mitochondrial mg2+ channel, shares many of the properties of the bacterial cora and yeast alr <dig> proteins . another family of bacterial mg2+ transporters comprises the mgta and mgtb proteins that have ten tmss and are members of the superfamily of p-type atpases . mammalian mg2+ transporters of the slc <dig> family share similarity with some regions of the bacterial mgte transporters, which possess five tmss . the mammalian ancient conserved domain protein  mg2+ transporters were also identified in prokaryotes . however, other mammalian transporters, including the trpm6/ <dig>  magt, nipa, mmgt, and hip <dig> families, were not identified in prokaryotic genomes .

four groups of proteins were shown to carry mg2+ ions in plants . the first group comprises transporters that are part of the cora superfamily  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana, this gene family has ten members, and the family was named mrs <dig>  <cit> , or alternatively mgt  <cit> . the slow-vacuolar  channel is a non-selective cation channel that can also carry mg2+ ions . the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel atcngc <dig> carries ca2+ and mg2+ ions  <cit> . the forth group consists of magnesium proton exchangers  proteins. the activity of a protein that exchanges protons with mg2+, zn2+ and cd2+ ions was first identified in vacuolar vesicles of rubber tree   <cit> . electrophysiological analysis and overexpression studies indicated that the a. thaliana mhx gene  encodes a mg2+/h+ exchanger, which exchanges protons with mg2+, zn2+, cd2+, and possibly fe2+ ions across the vacuolar membrane  <cit> . as the vacuole is acidic compared to the cytosol, atmhx apparently sequesters the metal cations into the vacuolar lumen, at the expense of releasing vacuolar protons into the cytosol. it is currently unknown whether the main impact of atmhx on plant physiology is related to metal or proton  homeostasis  <cit> . atmhx is highly expressed in the vascular region, particularly the phloem, of tissues with photosynthetic potential  <cit> . the 5′ untranslated region  of atmhx includes an aug codon upstream to the initiation codon of the main open reading frame . the resulting upstream orf  significantly inhibits atmhx expression, by inhibiting its translation  <cit>  and subjecting its transcript to degradation by the nonsense mediated mrna decay  pathway  <cit> .

atmhx showed high similarity  to mammalian sodium calcium exchanger  transporters  <cit> . ncx proteins are included in the ca2+/cation  exchanger superfamily. this superfamily was defined as a group of transporters that carry cytosolic ca2+ ions across membranes against their electrochemical gradient, by utilizing the electrochemical gradients of other cations, such as h+, na+, or k+ <cit> . the caca superfamily was classified into five major families, which were named, according to their first characterized member, yrbg, cax, ccx, ncx, and nckx  <cit> . yrbg transporters were mainly found in bacteria  <cit> . cax  are cation/h+ exchangers found in plants, bacteria, fungi, and lower vertebrates, but not in higher animals . all plant cax genes tested thus far transported ca2+, mn2+, cd2+, and zn2+ to varying degrees  <cit> . ccx  characterized thus far catalyse both na+/ca2+ and li+/ca2+ exchange . ncx are na+/ca2+ exchangers, and nckx are k+-dependent na+/ca2+ exchangers. ncx and nckx proteins were identified in mammals, nematodes, insects, squid, and algae  <cit> .vertebrates ncx proteins were clasified into four groups   <cit> .

the cardiac sarcolemmal na+/ca2+ exchanger   <cit>  is localized in the plasma membrane, and extrudes ca2+ to the extracellular space by utilizing the gradient of na+ ions. ncx <dig> is important for maintaining the balance of ca2+ ions during cardiac excitation/contraction, and its structure and function were extensively studied . the topology of ncx <dig> was investigated by mutating residues near the predicted tmss to cysteines and then examining the effects of intracellular and extracellular sulfhydryl-modifying reagents. based on this biochemical approach it was concluded that ncx <dig> includes a cleaved signal peptide, nine transmembrane segments , and two reentrant loops  <cit>  . it was suggested that the reentrant loops participate in the formation of the ion transport pathway of ncx <dig>  <cit> . the reentrant loops overlap two regions of internal similarity in ncx <dig>  designated the α <dig> and α <dig> repeats, which apparently resulted from an ancient gene duplication event  <cit> .

ncx <dig> includes a large intracellular loop between tmss  <dig> and  <dig>  this loop is not essential for na+-ca2+ exchange activity, but has a regulatory function  <cit> . ncx <dig> is activated by binding of intracellular ca2+ ions to two high-affinity ca2+-binding domains, called cbd <dig> and cbd <dig>  which are located in this large loop  <cit>  . ncx <dig> inactivation by intracellular na+ ions is mediated by a basic 20-amino acid segment of this large loop, called the xip  region  <cit>  .

the crystal structure of a prokaryotic na+/ca2+ exchanger  was recently characterized  <cit> . while the biochemically-determined topological model of the mammalian ncx <dig> exchanger only possesses nine tmss, the crystal structure of ncx_mj contains ten tmss.

with the recent increase in genomic information from various organisms, more knowledge is gained about the phylogenetics of plant metal transporters  <cit> . to increase our knowledge about the mhx group of mg2+ transporters, we present here a phylogenetic and structural analysis of  <dig> mhx proteins originating from  <dig> plant species.

methods
sequencing the cdna of the tomato, potato and wheat mhxs
we determined the cdna sequence of the mhx genes of solanum lycopersicum , solanum tuberosum , and triticum aestivum . all sequences were determined on both strands. the specific clones used for sequencing were ctoa20e <dig>  derived from s. lycopersicum cv. ta <dig>  st_bea0006l <dig>  derived from s. tuberosum cv. bintje, and whoh15o <dig> , derived from t. aestivum cv. chinese spring. the ctoa20e <dig> clone of s. lycopersicum includes a foreign dna insert of 112 bp, whose borders were determined by cloning the corresponding region of s. lycopersicum cv. vf- <dig> 

database searching and editing
the refseq  and phytozome databases were searched using the blastp and tblastn commands. the jgi database was searched  for additional algal proteins . additional file  <dig> presents a table of all proteins analysed in this study, and additional file  <dig> provides the sequences, accession numbers and explanations about manual modifications . proteins identified based on their similarity to atmhx are detailed in section  <dig> of additional file  <dig>  some sequences were partial, or apparently included extra n-terminal regions, probably due to misannotation of introns. these sequences were manually re-annotated based on similarity searches in the genomic sequences . most proteins were named here by their source organisms. the two mhx paralogs identified in each of the oryza sativa  subspecies, japonica and indica, were named o.sativa_j <dig> , o.sativa_j <dig>  o.sativa_i <dig> , and o.sativa_i <dig>  additional similarity searches were carried out using the proteins identified in chlamydomonas reinhardtii, selaginella moellendorffii, and physcomitrella patens as queries. only searches using the sequence from c. reinhardtii allowed us to identify new proteins, and this was followed by similarity searches using some of the new proteins as queries. the resulting  <dig> proteins are included in section  <dig> of additional file  <dig>  nine proteins that were identified in lower organisms based on their similarity to homo sapiens ncx <dig>  are included in section  <dig> of additional file  <dig>  the proteins in sections  <dig> and  <dig> of additional file  <dig> were named according to their source organisms, together with an arbitrary number when more than one protein was identified in the same organism .

the number of est clones derived from each of the m. guttatus and p. patens mhx genes was determined using files including the est data of these plants, which were sent to us ahead of publication by the phytozome database.

phylogenetic analysis and drawing of the phylogenetic trees
the phylogenetic analyses included marker proteins for the cax, ccx, nckx and yrbg families of the caca superfamily . these markers were chosen from the proteins classified by cai and lytton  <cit> , which performed the first phylogenetic analysis of the caca superfamily. the a. thaliana cax1- <dig> proteins served as markers for the cax family. the a. thaliana cax7- <dig> and cax <dig> proteins served as markers for the ccx family. although the latter proteins were initially called cax, they belong to the ccx family  <cit> . for clarity, the name of each marker protein included, besides the transporter name, the name of the family to which it belongs. for example, atcax <dig> was called atcax7_ccx. markers for the ncx family  were chosen from the proteins classified by marshall and co-workers  <cit> . the latter proteins were named by their source organisms, the name of their family , and a number that indicates to which of the four groups of vertebrate ncxs they belong, as indicated by  <cit> . updated sequence information  was retrieved from the databases for each of the marker proteins.

phylogenetic analyses were conducted using mega <dig> <cit> . we utilized the maximum likelihood method based on the jones-taylor-thornton  amino acid substitution model  <cit> . the bootstrap consensus trees inferred from  <dig> replicates  <cit>  were presented. branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates were collapsed. the phylogenetic trees were drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. all positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated.

topological analysis
hydropathy analysis and prediction of the tmss and their orientation were conducted using the tmpred algorithm  <cit> . the presence of a signal peptide was predicted by the signalp  <dig>  algorithm  <cit> .

sequence alignments and determination of pairwise similarity scores
protein sequences were aligned by clustalw <dig>  <cit>  or multalin  <cit>  as indicated in the text. the pairwise similarity scores presented in additional file  <dig> were determined by clustalw <dig> 

western blot analysis of atmhx under reducing and non-reducing conditions
western blot analysis of atmhx under reducing or non-reducing conditions  was carried out according to  <cit>  with some modifications. tobacco  plants overexpressing atmhx  <cit>  were grown in a climate-controlled greenhouse with a photoperiod of  <dig> h light and  <dig> h darkness. leaves of five-week-old plants were harvested and crushed into a fine powder in liquid nitrogen. frozen plant powder  was added into pre-weighted tubes containing  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm tris-hcl ph  <dig> , 20% glycerol, 6% sds,  <dig> % bromophenol blue, protease inhibitors , and either  <dig>  m β-mercaptoethanol or  <dig> mm n-ethylmaleimide . the samples were mixed well and incubated on ice for  <dig> h with frequent mixing. the samples were then centrifuged for  <dig> min at 4°c,  <dig>  g, and aliquots that derived from  <dig>  mg plant powder were fractionated by sds-page and blotted on a pvdf membrane . western blot analysis was performed by the chemiluminescence method, using polyclonal antibodies against a peptide from atmhx sequence  that were affinity-purified prior to use against the same peptide using the sulfolink coupling gel .

RESULTS
mhx proteins constitute a sixth family within the caca superfamily
genes with similarity to atmhx were searched in the databases or sequenced by us  . for the sake of clarity, most proteins were named here according to their source organisms. to determine the identity of the identified proteins, it was necessary to include in the phylogenetic analysis marker proteins for each of the five known families of the caca superfamily . in particular, many marker proteins were used for the ncx family.

phylogenetic analysis of all the sequences showed that mhx and ncx proteins belong to two separate families of the caca superfamily . the appearance of the mhxs as a subgroup of the ncx family in a previous analysis  <cit>  might result from the use of the hydrophobic regions only of the proteins analyzed, while the present analysis utilized the full protein sequences. the caca superfamily was originally indicated as containing five families  <cit> . our results indicated that mhx proteins constitute a sixth family within this superfamily. the pairwise scores of each protein similarity to atmhx, homo sapiens ncx <dig> , and the other proteins analysed are shown in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  the phylogenetic identity of each protein, as determined based on its position in the phylogenetic tree and the scores of its similarity to the marker proteins, is presented in additional file  <dig> 

mhx proteins were found in three divisions of the plant kingdom. the  <dig> mhxs identified in the first division, magnoliophyta  showed a similarly level of ~70% to each other . in the second division, lycopodiophyta, a protein showing 41% similarity to atmhx was found in s. moellendorffii, a vascular non-seed plant. in the third division, bryophyta, two proteins showing  <dig> and 40% similarity to atmhx were found in the moss p. patens, a non-vascular, non-seed plant. although the angiosperm and non-seed plant proteins appeared in two different clades , the non-seed plant proteins showed a higher similarity to angiosperm mhxs than to ncx proteins , and were, therefore, considered part of the mhx family. the existence of mhx family members in the moss p. patens indicates that although the vascular system is one of the major sites of atmhx expression in a. thaliana <cit> , mhx proteins also exist in non-vascular plants.

the mhxs apparently evolved from the ncxs after the split of the chlorophyte and streptophyte lineages
database searches identified proteins with similarity to atmhx in a fourth division of the plant kingdom, namely chlorophyta . within the chlorophyta, six proteins showing similarity to atmhx were identified in four single-celled algae - ostreococcus lucimarinus, ostreococcus sp. rcc <dig>  micromonas pusilla, and c. reinhardtii . the phylogenetic analysis showed that the protein identified in c. reinhardtii belongs to the ncx family, while the five proteins identified in the three other species belong to the nckx family . ncx and nckx proteins were previously identified in algae  <cit> . among the chlorophytes whose genomic information is currently available, no proteins showing similarity to atmhx were identified in volvox carteri or chlorella sp. nc64a. the currently available sequences of red algae do not include a protein with similarity to atmhx. proteins showing similarity to atmhx were identified in some algae that do not belong to the plantae but to the chromalveolata kingdom . among the nine proteins identified in chromalveolata, three belong to the ncx family while four proteins belong to the nckx family . two additional proteins identified in thalassiosira pseudonana apparently belong to a novel family of the caca superfamily .

most of the proteins identified by their similarity to the c. reinhardtii ncx  , as well as the proteins identified in lower organisms by their similarity to hsncx <dig> , were more related to ncx than to mhx proteins . searches in a large number of fungal species whose genome sequences were available revealed only five proteins showing limited similarity to atmhx. the protein identified in schizosaccharomyces pombe was classified to the ccx family  <cit> . the analysis showed that the proteins identified in botryotinia fuckeliana and yarrowia lipolytica were related to the ccx family as well . the proteins identified in the fungi aspergillus nidulans and schizophyllum commune could be the founder members of novel families of the caca superfamily . it, therefore, seems that there are no close homologs of mhx proteins in fungi. yet, it is possible that mg2+/h+ exchange is carried out in fungi by proteins with a different phylogenetic identity. it was reported that there is mg2+/h+ exchange activity in saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> , but the involved protein has still not been identified.

many prokaryotic proteins showed some degree of similarity to atmhx or hsncx <dig>  however, preliminary phylogenetic analyses showed that even the prokaryotic proteins with the highest similarity to atmhx or hsncx <dig>  which were identified in desulfococcus oleovorans and the cyanobacterium oscillatoria, respectively, did not belong to either the mhx or ncx families. we, therefore, did not include in the phylogenetic analysis other prokaryotic proteins except those of d. oleovorans, oscillatoria, and m. jannaschii. the latter species was added because the crystal structure of its na+/ca2+ exchanger was recently characterized  <cit> , and we wanted to evaluate the phylogenetic relatedness of this protein to mhx and ncx family proteins. as shown in figure  <dig>  the m. jannaschii na+/ca2+ exchanger belongs to the yrbg family, the d. oleovorans protein belongs to the nckx family, and the oscillatoria protein can belong to a novel family of the caca superfamily. it, therefore, seems that prokaryotes do not contain mhx-family proteins.

the analyses of all currently available sequences indicated that the mhx family is limited to plants and does not exist in other organisms. the plant kingdom includes two major phylogenetic groups that splitted ~ <dig>  billion years ago  <cit> , namely the streptophytes  and the chlorophytes . genomic information is not yet available for charophyte algae. the currently available chlorophyte genomes do not include proteins with homology to the mhxs, but only to ncx or nckx proteins. as indicated by their pairwise similarity scores , the mhxs are more similar to the ncxs than to the nckxs. the currently available data are consistent with the suggestion that the mhxs evolved from the ncxs after the split of the chlorophyte and streptophyte lineages of the plant kingdom.

evidence for functional diploidization of the mhxs
angiosperm mhx proteins were analysed separately in order to view their phylogenetic relationships at a higher resolution . in general, the similarity between mhx orthologs of different plant species correlated with the phylogenetic relationships of the plants. for example, mhx proteins clearly diverged into monocot and eudicot clades .

most plants had only one mhx ortholog. among the angiosperm whose genome sequences were available, two full mhx genes were identified only in mimulus guttatus  and o. sativa  . three of the plant species analysed here are polyploid: t. aestivum , and s. tuberosum and glycine max . the g. max genome had been completely sequenced. chromosome  <dig> of g. max includes a 1 kb fragment with high similarity to part of the full g. max mhx gene located on chromosome  <dig> . this 1 kb fragment cannot encode a full mhx protein. this indicates that the mhx loci were reduced to only two alleles subsequent to tetraploidization of the g. max genome. the secondary inactivation of some alleles subsequent to a previous polyploidization event, which results in the remaining of only two active alleles, was termed ‘functional diploidization’ . this process can occur, for example, by turning some of the genes into pseudogenes  <cit> . thus, the mhx loci of g. max underwent functional diploidization. only one cdna clone encoding a full mhx protein could be identified in the currently available databases of t. aestivum and s. tuberosum, and all the ests found were related to the single cdna identified in each of the two species. one possible explanation for the identification of only one mhx cdna in each of these species is related to the fact that their genomes have not been completely sequenced. yet, the absence of ests corresponding to another mhx gene in these polyploid species is in line with the possibility that their mhx genes underwent functional diploidization, which rendered extra gene copies non-functional.

zea mays  is a diploid but includes, in additional to a full mhx gene, two regions with similarity to parts of this gene . the existence of more than one copy of certain genes in diploid plants can be explained by the fact that there have been widespread genome duplication events throughout the history of flowering plants, including most species that are now considered to be diploid . a polyploidization event occurred about  <dig> million years ago  in the common ancestor of the major cereals  <cit> . maize underwent another genome-wide duplication event approximately  <dig> mya  <cit> . however, currently, only one functional mhx gene remains in the maize genome, indicating that the mhxs of this species underwent functional diploidization.

although o. sativa is a diploid, it has two mhx genes. the most recent genome-wide duplication event in rice history predated rice divergence from sorghum  <cit> . this fact, together with the phylogenetic trees shown in figure  <dig>  indicate that the two mhx genes of rice originated from isolated gene duplication and not from a genome-wide duplication event. the two proteins identified in each of the o. sativa subspecies japonica and indica showed a high similarity  to each other . these four proteins segregated into two mini-clades, each including one japonica and one indica ortholog . this suggests that mhx gene duplication in oryza occurred before the split between the o. sativa indica and japonica subspecies, which was estimated to have occurred  <dig> – <dig>  years ago  <cit> . it is interesting that the two indica mhx paralogs are located relatively close to each other  on chromosome  <dig>  whereas in japonica, one mhx paralog is located on chromosome  <dig> and the other on chromosome  <dig>  this indicates that one mhx paralog had translocated in one of the two subspecies . the two o. sativa orthologous mhx proteins of the first mini-clade, o.sativa_j <dig> and o.sativa_i <dig> , are highly similar to each other . the two orthologs of the second mini-clade, o.sativa_j <dig> and o.sativa_i <dig>  are somewhat less similar to each other . thus, the second mini-clade underwent a more rapid evolutionary divergence process compared to the first one. moreover, for both japonica and indica, all the ests of mhx genes that were found in the refseq database  originated from the first, but not the second, mini-clade. this suggests that the second mini-clade is expressed at a much lower level than the first, or its expression is much more restricted at the spatial or temporal level. these data are also consistent with the possibility that the genes of the second mini-clade turned into pseudogenes and are, therefore, neither expressed nor subjected to natural selection that restricts their divergence process. in accord with this possibility, we were unable to identify in the genomic sequence of the indica subspecies the coding region of the last ~ <dig> amino acids of the o.sativa_i <dig> protein, despite the high similarity in this region between the mhxs and, in particular, the three other o. sativa mhx sequences . o.sativa_i <dig> was, therefore, omitted from all sequence alignments.

the presence of two mhx genes in m. guttatus, which was sequenced from the diploid inbred line im <dig>  can be explained by the fact that members of the genus mimulus underwent polyploidization events in their history  <cit> . as far as we are aware, no data were published about the exact time of the polyploidization event in m. guttatus history, but the observation of only 74% similarity between the two mhxs of m. guttatus  suggests that considerable time had passed since this event. one est could currently be identified in the m. guttatus est database for each of its two mhx genes. this makes m. guttatus the only plant species in which evidence for the expression of more than one mhx-paralogous gene was obtained thus far.

the moss p. patens includes two mhx paralogous genes, whose deduced protein sequences share 65% similarity with each other . similar to all mosses, the enduring p. patens plant represents the haploid gametophyte. however, there is evidence that similar to most seed plants, p. patens is a paleopolyploid, which underwent a genome duplication event between 30- <dig> mya  <cit> . the phylogenetic analysis indicates that mhx gene duplication occurred in mosses  after the divergence of vascular plants from the mosses, which occurred approximately  <dig> mya . it is, therefore, likely that mhx gene duplication resulted from the indicated polyploidization event in p. patens history. one est was found in the database for the gene encoding p.patens_ <dig>  but no est was found for p.patens_ <dig>  in addition, we were unable to undoubtedly identify the sequence encoding the first ~ <dig> amino acids of p.patens_ <dig> in the p. patens genomic data, although this may result from the low similarity between the mhxs in this region. more data will be necessary to clearly determine if p.patens_ <dig> is expressed, but based on the current data it is possible that mhx underwent functional diploidization in  p. patens.

to conclude, the current est and genomic data suggest that the mhxs underwent functional diploidization in most plant species.

most plant mhx genes include uorfs
the 5′ utr of atmhx includes an uorf that substantially inhibits the expression of this gene by lowering its transcript content through nmd  <cit>  and by inhibiting its translation  <cit> . it was interesting to learn whether the mhx genes of other plants include uorfs as well. information about the 5′ utr was available for only some of the mhx genes. it was found that whereas only about 20% of the genes in plants include an uorf  <cit> , uorfs are present in a high percentage of the mhx genes . among the ten eudicot mhx genes whose 5′ utr sequences were available, all genes  included at least one uorf. three  of the six available 5′ utr sequences of monocot mhx genes included an uorf. this suggests that the presence of an uorf in mhx genes has some evolutionary advantage, possibly for restricting the expression of these genes.

in eukaryotes, the likelihood that an upstream aug  codon will be recognized by the ribosome and, hence, can inhibit expression, depends on the strength of its sequence  context  <cit> . the uaugs of plant mhx genes have not only weak but also sub-optimal and strong contexts . moreover, we showed that the uaug codon of atmhx is well recognized despite its weak context due to its stable secondary structure, resulting in strong inhibition of this gene expression  <cit> . recognition of uaug codons may lead to inhibition of translation and/or nmd  <cit> . the likelihood that either of the latter impacts will be realized is increased when the length of the uorf peptide is increased  <cit> . the potential uorf peptides of the currently identified mhx 5′ utrs are presented in additional file 6b. however, it is not possible to specify a definite cutoff size for peptide length that will inhibit translation  <cit> , and even the short uorf of atmhx inhibited translation and elicited nmd  <cit> . it will, therefore, be necessary to experimentally determine whether the expression of other plant mhx genes is inhibited by their uorfs. it will also be necessary to determine if uorfs, which are much more abundant in the mhxs than in most plant genes, play a role in functional diploidization of some mhxs. for example, there are two mhxs in o. sativa, but the 5′ utr sequence is available for only o.sativa_j <dig>  this 5′ utr does not include any uaug. our data suggest that o.sativa_j <dig> is expressed either exclusively or to a much higher level than o.sativa_j <dig> . in m. guttatus, the gene encoding the m.guttatus_ <dig> protein has a particularly high number of uaugs , including one with a strong kozak context. the 5′ utr of the gene encoding m.guttatus_ <dig> is currently unknown.

the peptides encoded by the uorfs of plant mhxs are not evolutionary conserved . this suggests that the amino acid sequence of the uorf peptide does not have a functional importance not only for atmhx <cit>  but also for the expression of other mhx genes. the similarity between the uorf peptides of the mhxs of a. thaliana and a. halleri, or s. lycopersicum and s. tuberosum  apparently resulted from the evolutionary relatedness of each pair of species.

conserved motifs in mhx and ncx transporters
we attempted to identify sequence elements that are conserved in the mhx and ncx families, as well as those that distinguish them from each other. we also attempted to identify sequence elements that characterize the mhx proteins of specific plant groups. this analysis can provide the basis for future experiments designed to determine the significance of the identified elements for the function and ion selectivity of these transporters. alignment of all currently identified mhx proteins is shown in additional file  <dig>  some of the proteins lack or apparently have few extra residues in the n-terminus. this is due to the low similarity between the mhxs in this region, which made it difficult to accurately predict the initiation point in the genomic sequence . the longest motif conserved in all mhx proteins, which includes six amino acids, is tadsai at position  <dig> of atmhx. there are also two conserved five-residue motifs – askia and elggp – at positions  <dig> and  <dig> of atmhx, respectively. as shown in additional file  <dig>  ncx proteins have, at the corresponding locations, similar motifs that are, however, not completely conserved in all ncxs. when only angiosperm mhx proteins were aligned, much longer conserved motifs could be identified .

to facilitate the presentation of sequence elements that characterize each group of proteins, the sequences of several representative proteins were aligned . the mhx proteins shown were from a. thaliana , o. sativa , p. patens , and s. moellendorffii . hsncx <dig> represented the ncx group. crncx was shown separately and was not taken into account in determining the consensus of ncx proteins due to its plant origin and in order to facilitate the visualization of its similarity to mhx and ncx proteins. the sequences labeled n <dig> and mj were used to present the current structural information about ncx <dig> and the m. jannaschii na+/ca2+ exchanger, respectively .

for each protein , only residues that were totally conserved in the whole group it represented were highlighted, either in gray or as detailed below. residues conserved among all mhx and ncx proteins investigated here were highlighted in red. the motif elgg  is the longest common sequence element of the two protein families, and it will be necessary to determine its functional significance. interestingly, ten of the  <dig> residues conserved between mhx and ncx proteins are glycines. it was suggested that glycines provide flexibility to active enzyme sites  <cit> . many conserved glycines were also identified in cax proteins  <cit> . ncx_mj, which similar to ncx <dig> functions as a na+/ca2+ exchanger, shares only four of the  <dig> residues that are completely conserved in all mhx and ncx proteins . thus, there might be some structural or functional properties that are shared by mhx transporters and na+/ca2+ exchangers of the ncx family, but not by other na+/ca2+ exchangers such as ncx_mj.

negatively charged residues are particularly important for the function of cation transporters. the negatively charged residues conserved between the mhxs and ncxs are glu200-glu <dig>  asp432-asp <dig>  and glu505-glu <dig> of atmhx and hsncx <dig>  respectively  . however, since mhx and ncx proteins carry different ions, these residues are unlikely to determine the ion specificity. the two-proline element at positions 361- <dig> and 758- <dig> of atmhx and hsncx <dig>  respectively, might be structurally significant . serine, threonine and cysteine residues shared by the mhxs, ncxs and ncx_mj will be discussed afterwards.

sequence elements that differ between mhx and ncx proteins
sequence elements that distinguish mhx from ncx transporters can provide a clue to the basis of the difference in their biochemical activities and ion specificities. to illustrate these elements, residues  that were totally conserved in all mhx proteins identified thus far were highlighted in light green . there are only three residues  in which all mhx proteins differ from all ncx proteins analysed. these three residues, which are located inside or near the functionally important α <dig> region, include:  asp at position  <dig> of atmhx - a negatively charged residue present in all mhxs, whereas all ncxs include the non-charged amino acid asparagine at the corresponding position. this asparagine is essential for ncx <dig> function, since its mutation into cysteine rendered the exchanger insensitive to regulation by cytoplasmic na+ or ca2+ ions  <cit> .  gln at position  <dig> of atmhx is a polar, non-charged amino acid found in all mhxs, while all ncxs have the negatively charged glutamate residue  at the same position. the different properties of gln <dig> of atmhx and glu <dig> of ncx <dig> have been previously noted  <cit> . it is also interesting to note that the mutation of glu <dig> of ncx <dig> into gln resulted in a complete loss of ncx <dig> activity  <cit> . this substitution is identical to the natural variation between ncx and mhx proteins at this position. it will be interesting to examine whether this mutation, despite abolishing na+/ca2+ exchange activity, allowed ncx <dig> to carry other ions.  the third residue that differs between all mhx and ncx proteins is asp at position  <dig> of atmhx, which parallels a glutamate residue of the ncxs . although both aspartate and glutamate are negatively charged, this variation can be functionally significant. for example, two ncx <dig> variants that had a glu-to-asp mutation at either position  <dig> or  <dig>  were completely inactive  <cit> . however, mutagenesis of glu <dig> into glutamine resulted in only 36% reduction in ncx <dig> activity  <cit> . among the three residues that differ between all mhxs and ncxs, ncx_mj shares the same residue with the ncxs only in the position that corresponds to gln <dig> of atmhx. residues in this position are, therefore, particularly interesting candidates for participation in the determination of the different ion selectivities of mg2+/h+ and na+/ca2+ exchangers.

it is likely that in addition to the three residues that differ between all mhx and ncx proteins, other residues can contribute to the different ion specificities of the two types of transporters. particularly interesting candidates are conserved mhx amino acids whose properties differ from those of the corresponding residues of most ncxs. such residues include , leu <dig>  – most ncxs have methionine at this position; ser <dig> – most ncxs have leucine at this position; glu <dig> and leu <dig> – most ncxs have threonine at these positions; gln <dig> – most ncxs have phenylalanine at this position; his <dig> – most ncxs do not have a positively charged residue at this position; pro <dig> – most ncxs do not have proline, a structurally important amino acid, at the vicinity of this position; and ala <dig> – most ncxs have a positively charged residue at this position.

according to the discussion about mhx evolution, crncx as well as the mhxs apparently evolved from an ncx protein that was present in the common ancestor of the streptophytes and chlorophytes. to visualize the similarity of crncx to the ncxs and the mhxs, residues of crncx that matched the conserved amino acids of either ncx or mhx proteins were highlighted in yellow or light green, respectively . crncx sequence is similar to that of the ncxs in almost all the conserved sites of the latter proteins, but the same doesn’t hold true for the mhxs. the few conserved ncx residues that do not match their corresponding crncx residues can provide the basis for a putative difference between the activities of crncx and ncx proteins . the consensus sequence of the mhxs, ncxs and crncx  apparently represents parts of the ancestral ncx protein that was present in the last common plant-animal ancestor, which existed ~ <dig>  billion years ago  <cit> .

sequence elements that characterize the mhxs of different plant groups
we also attempted to identify sequence elements that characterize the mhxs of different plant groups – vascular versus non-vascular plants, angiosperm compared to non-seed plants, and monocots versus eudicots. the differences between the mhxs of vascular and non-vascular plants could be functionally significant, considering the fact that atmhx is highly expressed in the vascular system. it is, therefore, possible that mhx proteins had to adapt for their role in this system during the evolution of vascular from non-vascular plants. residues that are conserved in the currently identified mhxs of all vascular plants, but differ from the corresponding amino acids of both p. patens mhxs , were highlighted in orange in figure  <dig>  among these residues, there is a relatively large difference between the properties of corresponding amino acids for trp <dig>  , thr <dig> , and ser <dig> . however, the current analysis is based only on the two sequences currently available from non-vascular plants, and it will be necessary to expand it in the future.

residues that are conserved in angiosperm mhxs but differ from the corresponding residues of all the currently identified mhxs of non-seed plants , are highlighted in dark green in figure  <dig>  six of these residues are localized between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> of atmhx, and it will be necessary to investigate whether this region is related to some functional properties that distinguish the mhxs of angiosperm from those of non-seed plants. in addition, there is a relatively large difference between the properties of corresponding amino acids for asp <dig> and asp <dig>  of angiosperm mhxs versus the corresponding two asparagines  of non-seed plants; his <dig>  of angiosperm versus leucine  of non-seed plants; and gly <dig> of angiosperm versus proline of non-seed plants. finally, residues that are conserved in either monocot or eudicot mhxs but differ between the two groups, are highlighted in olive-green in figure  <dig>  there are only three such residues and, among them, glu <dig> of the eudicots  should be particularly noted. it will be important to examine whether the variations described here between the mhxs of various plant groups are related to differences, if any, between the properties of these mhxs.

a structural model of the mhxs based on the resolved structures of ncx <dig> and ncx_mj
the structure of ncx <dig> and ncx_mj was extensively studied . we attempted to utilize this knowledge for gaining insight into the putative structure of mhx proteins. this could provide the basis for experimental investigation of mhx structure. figure  <dig> shows the hydropathy plots of the representative proteins included in figure  <dig>  the hydropathy plots of mhx transporters from various phylogenetic groups resemble each other, and also show high similarity to the hydropathy plot of hsncx <dig> and  ncx_mj . this supports the idea that the structures of mhx transporters resemble those of the latter proteins. the duplicate sequence of hsncx <dig>  and the sequence of ncx_mj  in figure  <dig> present the current structural information gained from biochemical analyses of ncx <dig> and crystallography of ncx_mj, respectively . the experimentally identified tmss of ncx <dig> and ncx_mj are highlighted in light blue on the n <dig> and mj sequences, respectively . although ncx_mj belongs to the yrbg family, it shares similarity with the ncxs, and was shown to function as a na+/ca2+ exchanger  <cit> . yet, whereas ncx <dig> was shown to possesses nine tmss and two reentrant loops  <cit> , the crystal structure of ncx_mj contains ten tmss  <cit> . it was noted that there could be some deviation between the structures of ncx <dig> and ncx_mj  <cit> . this possibility is sensible since despite its name , ncx_mj does not belong to the ncx but to the yrbg family. biochemical methods correctly identified that yrbg proteins contain ten tmss  <cit> . it is, therefore, reasonable that the biochemical analyses of ncx <dig> were able to correctly identify its nine tmss and two reentrant loops  <cit> . our suggested explanation for the basis of the structural difference between ncx <dig> and ncx_mj is delineated below. in general, there was a good correlation between tms position in ncx <dig> and ncx_mj . however, the region that corresponds to the 8th tms of ncx_mj was shown to be the second reentrant loop of ncx <dig>  <cit>  . there is a conserved gxg motif at positions 449- <dig> of atmhx and 846- <dig> of hsncx <dig>  it was noted  <cit>  that this motif in ncx <dig> is similar to the gyg motif in the p-loop of k+ channels  <cit>  and the gig motif in the pore region of the sarcoplasmic ca2+ release channels   <cit> . it was suggested that this gxg motif creates a tight turn in the second reentrant loop of ncx <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, this gxg motif is absent from ncx_mj , possibly providing a structural basis for the existence in this location of a reentrant loop in the ncxs as compared to a tms in ncx_mj. similar to the ncxs, the mhxs include this gxg motif. for this reason, in addition to the higher similarity of the mhxs to ncx <dig> than to ncx_mj  we assume that mhx structure is more similar to that of ncx <dig> than to the yrbg-family ncx_mj protein. therefore, the number and orientation of mhx tmss and loops were indicated according to those of ncx <dig>  however, except the difference detailed above, the crystal structure of ncx_mj agrees with the structural analysis of ncx <dig>  thereby strengthening the overall structural model presented in figure  <dig> 

in most regions, there was a good agreement between the experimental observations in ncx <dig> and the prediction of its tmss by the tmpred algorithm . the tmss predicted by tmpred in the mhxs are indicated by bold, underlined letters in the mhxs sequences. it is reasonable that the positions of mhx tmss correspond to those of ncx <dig>  particularly where the tmpred predictions for the two groups of proteins agree with each other and with the experimentally-identified positions of ncx <dig> tmss. as mentioned, ncx <dig> was shown to contain two reentrant loops  <cit> . the hydropathy plots of the mhxs resemble that of hsncx <dig> also in the regions that correspond to the two reentrant loops of ncx <dig> . this analysis suggests that the mhxs have nine tmss and two reentrant loops. however, it will be necessary to test this suggestion experimentally.

the tmss predicted by tmpred were mainly located at equivalent positions of the four representative mhx proteins shown in figure  <dig>  however, there were certain regions of dissimilarity, for example, an extra tms was predicted before tms <dig> in the mhxs of o. sativa and p. patens, but not a. thaliana or s. moellendorffii. it was interesting to examine if there are subgroups of mhx proteins with distinct structures, for example, whether the mhxs of all monocots show structural similarity to o.sativa_j <dig>  additional file  <dig> shows the tmss predicted by tmpred for all mhxs studied here. these tmss were predominantly located at equivalent positions for most mhxs. this suggests that there is a relatively large similarity in the structures of various mhx proteins. for only few proteins, tmpred predicted a deviation from the common structure in the region of tmss  <dig> and  <dig>  which surround the large central loop. it was predicted that the p. patens mhxs lack tms <dig>  and that seven out of the  <dig> mhxs analysed have an extra tms before tms <dig>  however, tmpred predictions for the large central loop region were not accurate also for ncx <dig>  which was also predicted to have an extra tms before tms <dig> , while experimental evidence proved that this is not the case. the tmpred analysis was useful for identifying that there was no clear distinction between the mhxs of different phylogenetic groups, e.g., of monocots and eudicots . based on this fact, together with the high sequence similarity between different mhx proteins , we assume it is not likely that some of them have a switched tms topology, and they are all likely to share the common structure indicated in figure  <dig>  the e. grandis mhx was predicted to have an extra tms before tms <dig>  the signalp  <dig>  algorithm suggests that the e. grandis mhx does not have a signal peptide, and it will be necessary to determine if the initiation point of this protein was correctly annotated.

while ncx <dig> has a cleaved signal peptide  <cit>  , the corresponding region is missing in the mhxs. except ncx <dig>  none of the other proteins presented in figure  <dig>  including crncx, was predicted to have a signal peptide by the signalp  <dig>  algorithm  <cit> . the same algorithm correctly predicted the presence of a cleaved signal peptide in hsncx <dig>  the experimentally determined orientations of ncx <dig> loops, as well as n- and c-terminal regions  <cit> , are indicated in figure  <dig>  for ncx <dig>  which is located in the plasma membrane, the “in” or “out” oriented loops face the cytosol or the extracellular space, respectively. however, mhx proteins studied thus far are localized in the vacuolar membrane  <cit> . for tonoplast proteins, cytosolic loops are considered to be internal, whereas loops that face the vacuolar lumen are considered to be external. this categorization is based on the similar biophysical properties of the vacuolar lumen and the extracellular space in terms of their ph and electrochemical potential. the electrochemical potential plays an important role in determining the orientation of membrane-protein loops  <cit> . it will be necessary to determine if the orientation of mhx loops is similar to that of the corresponding ncx <dig> loops. the large central loop, which exists in both ncx and mhx proteins and faces the cytosol in ncx <dig>  is much longer in ncx compared to mhx proteins . in accord with the segregation of the protein identified in c. reinhardtii with the ncx family, the length of its central loop is similar to that of hsncx <dig> .

the degree of sequence conservation was much higher in the predicted tmss than in non-tms regions of the various mhxs  . a similar phenomenon was observed in other membrane proteins. exceptionally, loop f , which includes the conserved motif elggp, shows a high degree of conservation  . the large central loop  of the various mhxs showed a low degree of conservation. as mentioned above, the corresponding loop of ncx <dig> is not essential for its transport activity. particularly notable is the high degree of conservation in tmss  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and in the second reentrant loop . these areas  largely overlap the α-repeat regions, which have great importance for the transport activity of ncx <dig> and ncx_mj  <cit> . the high degree of conservation of these regions in mhx proteins suggests that they play a critical role in the mhxs as well.

athe percentage of the completely conserved amino acids from the total number of amino acids in each tms or loop of mhx proteins. the latter regions were defined according to the indications on the consensus sequence in additional file  <dig> 

bthe total lengths assigned for the n-terminal and loop d regions were the averages of their lengths in the individual proteins .

the α <dig> and α <dig> repeat regions of ncx <dig>  as defined in  <cit> , are indicated in figure  <dig>  as mentioned, the α <dig> and α <dig> regions of ncx <dig> have internal similarity, and apparently originated from an ancient gene duplication event  <cit> . the α <dig> regions of the ncxs, mhxs and crncx were aligned to the α <dig> regions of the same proteins, either for each protein group separately  or in combination . the consensus sequence of the combined alignment  apparently represents part of the amino acid sequence of the ancestral parental protein that existed before the duplication event. it is also possible to identify residues  that have apparently diverged from this presumed ancestral sequence in most mhx or ncx proteins.

three of the ten glycines conserved in mhx and ncx proteins are located in the α1-reentrant loop  <dig> region and three are in the α2-reentrant loop  <dig> region . of the three glycines conserved in the second reentrant loop, two create the gxg motif discussed above. the central amino acid of this motif is mainly ile or leu. the only three proteins  in which the central amino acid of this gxg motif is not ile or leu, are the mhxs of s. moellendorffii and p. patens , where the xs are fhe and thr, respectively, and the ncx of a. pisum, where the x is val. while the ile, leu, and val residues have a similar nature, it will be interesting to learn if the benzyl or alcohol groups of fhe or thr, respectively, confer any special properties to the indicated mhxs of s. moellendorffii or p. patens, respectively.

a search for mhx elements that correspond to functionally important ncx <dig> and ncx_mj elements
the study of ncx <dig> resulted in identification of several sequence elements that play a critical role in the function of this transporter. amino acids whose mutation resulted in a complete loss of ncx <dig> activity  <cit>  are highlighted in cyan on the n <dig> sequence in figure  <dig>  these residues were mainly localized in the α repeat regions. many of these residues corresponded to ncx_mj amino acids that were shown to participate in ion binding , which were all from the two α repeats  <cit> . the nine residues whose functional significance was indicated in both ncx <dig> and ncx_mj  include two charged residues, six ser/thr residues, and asn at position  <dig> . the charged residues are glu <dig>  and d <dig> . interestingly, six of the positions whose functional significance was indicated in both ncx <dig> and ncx_mj include serine or threonine in almost all mhx and ncx proteins and in ncx_mj . serine and threonine can be used as phosphorylation sites. ncx <dig> is controlled by phosphorylation , and it will be interesting to determine whether the indicated ser/thr residues participate in regulating ncx  proteins by phosphorylation. these ser/thr residues are located at positions  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> , and  <dig>  . there are other sites in which serine or threonine residues  are almost completely conserved in the mhxs and ncxs, including positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> .

six α-repeat residues whose mutagenesis altered the ca2+ affinity of ncx <dig>  <cit>  are indicated by red letters on the n <dig> sequence. a mutations in thr <dig> altered ncx <dig> affinity for cytoplasmic na+ ions  <cit> . it was suggested that this interface of a cytoplasmic loop and tms <dig> is important for both na+ transport and secondary regulation by na+ ions . it will be interesting to examine the role of the corresponding residues of mhx proteins.

the large cytosolic loop of ncx <dig> regulates its activity  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the position in this loop of the regulatory ca2+-binding domains cbd <dig> and cbd <dig>  which are responsible for ncx <dig> activation by cytosolic ca2+ ions  <cit> . electrophysiological analysis showed that, similar to ncx <dig>  atmhx is activated when ca2+ ions are applied to its cytosolic  side  <cit> . the cbd domains of ncx <dig> include a high density of negatively charged residues . regions with relatively high densities of negatively charged residues are marked with red boxes on the central loops of the representative mhx proteins . the large cytosolic loop of ncx <dig> also includes the xip peptide responsible for ncx <dig> inactivation  <cit>  . electrophysiological analysis showed that atmhx undergoes an inactivation process with a time scale similar to that of ncx <dig>  <cit> . while the xip peptide of hsncx <dig> includes eight basic residues, the corresponding regions of plant mhxs, particularly of the angiosperm, include about four basic residues, most of which are evolutionarily conserved . the comparable region of crncx includes five basic residues. it will be necessary to determine if, according to the structural model presented in figure  <dig>  the large central loop of the mhxs faces the cytosol, if it is essential for mhx transport activity, and whether loop elements with similarity to the xip or cbd regions of ncx <dig> play a role in mhx inactivation or regulation by ca2+ ions, respectively.

altered mobility under reducing and non-reducing conditions suggests the presence of a disulfide bond in atmhx
ncx <dig> includes a disulfide bond between cys <dig> and a cysteine at position  <dig> or  <dig>  <cit> . ddisulfide bonds are, however, not essential for ncx <dig> function  <cit> . cys <dig> of hsncx <dig> and the equivalent cys <dig> of atmhx are conserved in all ncx and mhx proteins . in parallel to the cysteines at position  <dig> and  <dig> of hsncx <dig>  all mhxs possess a cysteine in the n-terminal region that is equivalent to cys <dig> of atmhx in most proteins . another cysteine residue - equivalent to cys <dig> of atmhx - is conserved in all mhx and ncx proteins. it is possible that some of these conserved cysteines participate in disulfide bond formation in mhx proteins.

the presence of disulfide bonds in ncx <dig> was demonstrated by comparing its mobility on sds-page under reducing and non-reducing conditions  <cit> . this approach is widely used to monitor the formation of disulfide bonds in proteins  <cit> . while under reducing conditions  ncx <dig> appeared as two bands in the gel  <cit> , only a single band was observed under non-reducing conditions . nem is a small compound that permanently blocks free cysteines, thereby trapping proteins at their original folding state  <cit> . the difference between the apparent molecular mass of ncx <dig> under reducing and non-reducing conditions indicated that it includes disulfide bonds  <cit> .

similar to ncx <dig>  we observed that in many cases atmhx appears as two bands when analysed by sds-page under reducing conditions . to explore the presence of disulfide bonds in atmhx, we treated leaves of tobacco plants overexpressing this protein with β-mercaptoethanol or nem . following fractionation by sds-page, the samples were subjected to western blot analysis using antibodies against a peptide from atmhx sequence  . similar results were obtained in two independent tobacco plants overexpressing atmhx, and when using antibodies against another atmhx-derived peptide . the two bands observed in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol had an apparent molecular mass of  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda. the molecular mass of  <dig>  kda is in excellent agreement with the value predicted for a single atmhx molecule based on the protein’s length . under non-reducing conditions , we observed only the lower band with apparent molecular mass of  <dig>  kda, whose intensity was doubled. the lower apparent molecular mass of the non-reduced atmhx protein is in agreement with the general observation that oxidized proteins migrate faster by sds-page compared with their reduced forms  <cit> . similar to the observations in ncx <dig>  <cit> , β-mercaptoethanol reduced only part of the oxidized atmhx protein, resulting in the appearance of two bands in the gel. as mentioned above, nem  traps proteins at their original folding state  <cit> . these data suggest that atmhx includes in planta at least one intramolecular disulfide bond.

CONCLUSIONS
the mhx family is limited to plants, and constitutes a sixth family within the caca superfamily. among the plants for which genomic information is currently available, more than one full mhx gene was identified only in o. sativa and m. guttatus. mhx gene duplication in o. sativa occurred de novo before the split between the indica and japonica subspecies, which happened  <dig> – <dig>  years ago. most likely, following an initial duplication in chromosome  <dig>  one mhx paralog translocated to chromosome  <dig> in japonica. some genomes include, in addition to a full mhx gene, loci with partial mhx-homologous sequences. genomic and est data suggest that mhx genes underwent functional diploidization in most plant species. currently, m. guttatus is the only plant in which an est was identified for more than one mhx-paralogous gene. the prevalence of uorfs in mhx genes is much higher than in most plant genes. these uorfs can limit expression and, potentially, contribute to functional diploidization of the mhxs. the currently available chlorophyte genomes do not include proteins with homology to the mhxs, but only to ncx or nckx proteins. the mhxs are more similar to the ncxs than to the nckxs. these data are consistent with the suggestion that the mhxs evolved from the ncxs after the split of the chlorophyte and streptophyte lineages of the plant kingdom, which occurred ~ <dig>  billion years ago.

a structural model of the mhxs, based on the resolved structure of ncx <dig>  implies that the mhxs include nine tmss. altered mobility in reduced and non-reduced conditions suggests the presence of disulfide bonds in atmhx. there are  <dig> residues that are completely conserved between all mhx and ncx proteins, among which ten are glycines. these conserved residues include an elgg motif in the last loop and a gxg motif that was implicated in the formation of a tight-turn in a reentrant loop. there are only three residues in which all mhx proteins differ from all ncx proteins analysed. the identification of sequence elements that distinguish between the mhxs and ncxs, or between the mhxs of specific plant groups, can contribute to clarification of the structural basis of the function and ion selectivity of mhx transporters.
