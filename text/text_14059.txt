BACKGROUND
continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis  is an alternative therapy to hemodialysis for the treatment of end-stage renal disease. during capd, the peritoneum is exposed to bio-incompatible dialysis fluids that cause peritoneal fibrosis  by denudation of mesothelial cells. thus, pf is a common morphological change in peritoneal dialysis  patients and in pd animal models  <cit> . this change is associated with impaired peritoneal membrane function, ultrafiltration failure culminating into discontinuation of dialysis  <cit> . furthermore, epithelial-mesenchymal transition  of peritoneal mesothelial cells  plays a crucial initiating role in the progression of pf  <cit> . many factors, including high glucose , hypertonicity, low ph, glucose degradation products and advanced glycation end-products  can induce transforming growth factor-β <dig>  activation, and blocking of tgf-β <dig> signaling protects the peritoneal membrane from dialysate-induced damage  <cit> . therefore, tgf-β <dig> has been regarded as the primary regulator and plays a central role in mmt and fibrosis of peritoneal tissue during pd.

recent studies suggest that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase kinase  /akt signaling not only plays an important role in the regulation of cell survival, growth, metabolism and migration  <cit> , but also modulates emt transformation that may be independent of tgf-β1/smad signaling  <cit> . in addition, pik/akt activation induced by tgf-β through the direct binding of type i transforming growth factor receptor  to pik  <cit>  is related to increased ecm protein expression  <cit> . furthermore, tgf-β <dig> induces fibrosis in various cell lines including human lung cancer cells, hepatocellular carcinoma and renal proximal tubule cells via the pi3k/akt signaling pathways  <cit> . on the other hand, it has been reported that akt modulates e <dig> ubiquitin ligase, such as the transcription of smad <dig> ubiquitination regulatory factor <dig>  that is induced by tgf-β <dig>  <cit> , indicating that tgf-β1/akt/smurf <dig> pathway may play a critical role in some pathophysiological conditions. furthermore, it has been reported that smurf <dig> contributes to a reduction of smad <dig> in fibrosing uuo kidneys  <cit> . the smurf <dig> levels have been reported to be increased in early period of fibrosis in rat liver and tgf-β1-treated lx- <dig> cells, and they are accompanied with reduced levels of smad <dig>  <cit> . thus, it seems that smad <dig> provides a negative feedback to tβr <dig> by binding to smurf <dig> and brings smurf <dig> to the activated tβr for their polyubiquitination and degradation  <cit> . this would indicate that decreased levels of smad <dig> may lead to activation of tgf-β <dig> signaling. it has been demonstrated that smad <dig> expression is decreased in peritoneum of pd patients. overexpression of smad <dig> inhibits smad2/ <dig> activation and the emt related protein expression, extracellular matrix protein  and fibrosis in the peritoneal mesothelial cells and animal models of pd  <cit> . whether akt induces smurf <dig> expression and then inhibits smad <dig> participation in mmt transformation during pd and the relevant mechanism involved have not been thoroughly explored.

the tgf-β receptors  play a key role in tgf-β signaling pathway, which is targeted for ubiquitylation-mediated degradation by the smad7/smurf <dig> complex  <cit> . emerging studies have demonstrated that deubiquitinating enzymes  play a key role for maintaining tβri stability. among of them, ubiquitin-specific peptidase- <dig>  and- <dig>  extend the life of activated tβri and are against the negative pressure of tβri-ubiquitinating complexes  <cit> . interestingly, it was also found that akt directly associates and phosphorylates usp <dig>  and then induces the translocation of usp <dig> from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and plasmalemma for maintaining tβri stability  <cit> . therefore, usp <dig> mediates tβri regulation via pi3k/akt pathway, which is a strong modulator of tgf-β pathway and plays a critical role in the crosstalk between tgf-β and akt signaling. whether akt mediates mmt transformation in pd fibrosis and the mechanism by which usp <dig> is involved in this process has yet to be elucidated.

in the present study, we investigated that if increased activation of akt exerts a critical effect on tgf-β <dig> induced mmt in pd via smurf2/smad <dig> complex and usp4/tβri pathway.

RESULTS
expression of tgf-β <dig> and p-akt, smurf <dig> and smad <dig> in pd mice
elisa assay showed that the concentration of tgf-β <dig> increased in the peritoneal effluent of pd mice compared to control , while there are no further significant changes in mice treated with the pi3k/akt inhibitor, ly <dig> . by real-time pcr, an up-regulated expression of smurf <dig> mrna was observed in the peritoneal tissues of pd mice, while it was dramatically down-regulated in mice treated with ly <dig> . confocal imaging with anti-phospho-akt <dig>  antibody  showed that there was a low level of phosphorylated akt  expression in the peritoneum of control mice and it markedly increased in pd mice. the expression was significantly inhibited by ly <dig> . like the pakt, a parallel increase in the smurf <dig> levels was also observed . in addition, western blot analyses revealed that the protein expression of pakt  and smurf <dig>  were markedly increased in pd mice compared to control, which was reversed by treatment with ly <dig>  in contrast, a decreased expression of smad <dig> protein was seen in pd mice, and smad <dig> expression was restored by the treatment with ly <dig> .figure  <dig>

inhibition of akt normalizes the altered expression of zo- <dig>  vimentin and fibrosis in the peritoneum of pd mice
morphological changes in the peritoneum were assessed by h & e and masson staining. the thickness of the sub-mesothelial tissue in the peritoneum of pd mice increased approximately 4– <dig> times compared to control, whereas, it was dramatically attenuated in mice treated with ly <dig> . in addition, by real time pcr, vimentin and fibronectin  mrna expression in the peritoneal tissue of pd mice were significantly increased, which was accompanied with markedly decreased mrna expression of zo- <dig>  however, treatment with ly <dig> led to a significant normalization of their expression . similar results were observed for the protein expression by tissue image analysis with immunofluorescence microscopy , which were confirmed by western blot analyses .figure  <dig>

tgf-β <dig> increases the expression of pakt, smurf <dig> and mmt-relevant proteins and down-regulates smad <dig> expression in hpmcs
hpmcs were exposed to different concentrations of tgf-β <dig>  for 48 hrs. by real time pcr, a significant dose dependent decrease in the mrna expression of zo- <dig> was observed. in contrast, the mrna expression of vimentin and smurf <dig> were increased markedly in a dose dependent manner . western blot analyses showed that a dose-dependent up-regulated expression of pakt and smurf <dig> in hpmcs following stimulation with tgf-β <dig>  while the expression of smad <dig> protein was significantly down-regulated. in addition, a decreased expression of zo- <dig> and an increased expression of vimentin in a dose-dependent manner were observed . furthermore, by elisa, a dose-dependent increased protein concentration of fn was noted in hpmcs exposed to tgf-β <dig> .figure  <dig>

to delineate the role of tgf-β <dig> in the gene and protein expression of above indicated molecules with time course, hpmcs were incubated with 5 ng/ml tgf-β <dig> for 0–72 hrs. as shown in figure 4a-4c, zo- <dig> mrna expression was significantly decreased in a time dependent manner , while that of vimentin expression was increased . interestingly, the smurf <dig> expression showed a dramatically increase up to 12–48 hrs and then it was somewhat reduced but did not reach to the basal levels . confocal image of cell immunofluorescence clearly showed an enhanced pakt nuclear expression in hpmcs after incubation with tgf-β <dig> for 15 min, and it increased a little bit further at 30 min . the expression of smurf <dig> was also increased in the cytoplasm of hpmcs treated by tgf-β <dig> for 12 hrs, and it peaked at 24 hrs . additionally, a significant decreased immunofluorescence signal in the cell membrane, depicting zo- <dig> expression, was observed in hpmcs treated with tgf-β1at 48 hrs, and it further decreased at 72 hrs . the vimentin expression increased in a time-dependent manner . by western blot analyses, pakt protein expression was increased significantly in hpmcs treated with tgf-β <dig> for 30 min, and then it gradually decreased but did not reach to the basal levels . similar expression profiles were also observed for the smurf <dig> protein where it peaked at 24 hrs . the zo- <dig> and smad <dig> expression was significantly decreased in a time-dependent manner up to 72 hrs ; and in contrast, vimentin expression was increased .figure  <dig>

akt inhibited tgf-β1-induced expression of mmt relevant proteins in hpmcs
real- time pcr showed that zo- <dig> mrna expression decreased significantly in hpmcs treated with tgf-β <dig>  while it was partially restored by the treatment with ly <dig> or by transfection of with an akt-dominant negative plasmid  , in addition, opposite results were observed for vimentin mrna expression . by immunofluorescence microscopy, hpmcs stained with anti-pakt, −zo- <dig>  −vimentin antibodies yielded parallel results. tgf-β <dig> significantly increased the expression of pakt, while it was reversed with the treatment of ly <dig> or over-expression of akt-dn . additionally, cells treated with ly <dig> or akt-dn had normalized altered zo- <dig> and vimentin expression in hpmcs concomitantly treated with tgf-β <dig> . furthermore, by western blot analysis, an increased expression of pakt in the nuclear extract from hpmcs treated with tgf-β <dig> was observed, while it was reduced in cells transfected with akt-dn plasmid, while no significant change was seen in the total akt expression . on the other hand, pakt expression was decreased in cytoplasmic extract from hpmcs treated with tgf-β <dig>  while normalized following treatment with ly <dig> or akt-dn , as detected by western blot analyses. similar results were also observed in the emt/mmt relevant proteins such as vimentin expression . in contrast, zo- <dig> protein expression was noted to be decreased in hpmcs treated with tgf-β <dig>  however, the effect was partially blocked by the treatment with ly <dig> or akt-dn .figure  <dig>

effect of akt on the expression of smurf <dig> and smad7
real-time pcr revealed that mrna expression of smurf <dig> significantly increased in hpmcs treated with tgf-β <dig>  while the expression was blocked partially in a dose-dependent manner either by the treatment with ly <dig> or transfection with akt-dn mutant plasmid . western blot analyses showed that the smad <dig> protein expression was significantly inhibited in hpmcs incubated with tgf-β <dig>  while it was restored partially by the treatment with either ly <dig> or transfection with an akt-dn . in contract, the smurf <dig> expression was increased in hpmcs treated with tgf-β <dig>  while it was reduced in cells treated with y <dig> or transfection with an akt-dn . in addition, the up-regulated expression of smurf <dig> was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy following the staining with anti-smurf <dig> antibody. interestingly, akt-dn only partially inhibited the tgf-β-induced smurf <dig> expression  while completely with ly <dig> .figure  <dig>

effect of akt, smurf <dig> and usp <dig> on the expression of zo- <dig>  vimentin and fibronectin in hpmcs incubated with tgf-β1
by real-time pcr, a significantly decreased mrna expression of zo- <dig> was seen in hpmcs incubated with tgf-β <dig> or transfected with flag-akt plasmid , while no affect was seen in cells treated with smurf <dig> sirna and usp <dig> sirna . tgf-β <dig> reduced zo- <dig> mrna expression, which was restored following concomitant treatment with smurf <dig> sirna and usp <dig> sirna . in addition, zo- <dig> expression was decreased by tgf-β <dig> plus flag-akt treatment , and it was partially restored by transfection of smurf <dig> sirna or usp <dig> sirna . in contrast, opposite results were observed for the vimentin mrna expression . similar results were also seen for the protein expression of zo- <dig> and vimentin, as detected by western blot procedures . fibronectin  protein expression in hpmcs was also measured by elisa. an increased fn expression was seen in hpmcs exposed to tgf-β <dig> or transfected with flag-akt . no change in the fn expression was observed in cells treated with smurf <dig> sirna or usp <dig> sirna alone compared to basal levels. the effect of tgf-β <dig> on the expression of fn was partially blocked by the treatment with smurf <dig> sirna or usp <dig> sirna , but was further augmented with transfection of flag-akt. in addition, smurf <dig> sirna and usp <dig> sirna reduced the up-regulated expression of fn in hpmcs induced by tgf-β1plus flag-akt . compared to controls, the mrna and protein expression did not change in cells treated with scrambled sirnas .figure  <dig>

effect of tgf-β <dig>  akt and usp <dig> on tβr- <dig>  smad <dig> and smurf <dig> expression and the interaction between smurf <dig> and smad <dig> as well as tβr-1
western blot analyses showed that the tβr- <dig> expression was significantly increased in hpmcs treated with tgf-β <dig> and flag-akt , whereas no change was seen in cells treated with smurf <dig> sirna or usp <dig> sirna . tgf-β <dig> up-regulated expression of tβr- <dig> was further enhanced by treatment with smurf <dig> sirna and flag-akt plasmid , while it was reduced by usp <dig> sirna . in addition, tgf-β <dig> plus flag-akt increased tβr- <dig> expression was augmented with the co-transfection of smurf <dig> sirna . it was also noted that smad <dig> protein levels decreased in hpmcs treated with tgf-β <dig> or flag-akt plasmid. no change was seen in smurf <dig> sirna or usp <dig> sirna. tgf-β <dig> decreased smad <dig> expression, and it was partially reversed by the pre-treatment of smurf <dig> sirna or usp <dig> sirna. the tgf-β <dig> decreased smad <dig> expression was little bit further reduced by co-transfection with flag-akt. tgf-β <dig> plus flag-akt reduced smad <dig> expression, and it was partially blocked by either co-transfection with smurf <dig> sirna or usp <dig> sirna . in addition, there were no significant differences in smurf <dig> expression between cells treated with tgf-β1+ flag-akt and tgf-β1+ flag-akt + usp <dig> sirna. almost opposite results were seen for smad <dig> protein expression compared to the smurf <dig> expression profiles following various treatments .figure  <dig>

the immunoprecipitation/western blot  assay revealed an increased signal representing the interaction between smurf <dig> and smad <dig> in hpmcs following tgf-β <dig> treatment . however, the signal was significantly reduced with the transfection of akt-dn . on the other hand, tgf-β <dig> reduced the association between smurf <dig> and tβr- <dig>  while it was restored by treatment with usp <dig> sirna . smurf <dig> expression by ip/wb revealed no significant change, and smurf <dig> served as loading control .

discussion
the observations made in this investigation suggest a relevance of akt with respect to the pathology of mesothelial mesenchymal transition/transformation  in human peritoneal mesothelial cells  and peritoneal fibrosis in mice undergoing peritoneal dialysis . we demonstrated that akt modulates tgf-β1-induced mmt and peritoneal fibrosis in pd via downstream interactive signaling molecules, such as, smurf <dig> and smad <dig>  and usp <dig> and tβr- <dig> 

epithelial-mesenchymal transition/transformation , a prototype of mmt, is a complex and generally reversible process that plays an important role in embryogenesis, metastasis of malignant cells and tissue fibrosis  <cit> . during peritoneal dialysis, mesothelial cells undergo emt/ mmt associated with peritoneal-membrane injury. conceivably, blocking mmt by tamoxifen in the pd animal model can ameliorate peritoneal membrane damage  <cit> . mmt could lead to peritoneal fibrosis and peritoneal membrane dysfunction during long-term pd  <cit> . recent studies have shown that a large number of factors involved in the process of mmt in pd. consensus from various studies are that tgf-β <dig> is a critical inducer in mmt and fibrosis in pd  <cit> . previously, we demonstrated that tgf-β <dig> induced emt in human peritoneal mesothelial cells   <cit> . here, we extended our studies in animal models and demonstrated that mmt is associated with some of the ecm proteins, such as fibronectin and fibrosis in the peritoneum of mice undergoing pd . consistent with this was thickening of sub-mesothelial tissues and up-regulation of tgf-β <dig> in pd effluent . in addition, the in vitro studies confirmed that tgf-β <dig> is capable of inducing the mmt-relevant proteins expression in hpmcs . the expression of these proteins seems to be modulated by increased or reduced expression of akt with tgf-β <dig> being the upstream regulator. our results are consistent with previous reports indicating inhibiting tgf-β <dig> signaling ameliorates experimental peritoneal fibrosis  <cit> . these studies also implicated that akt could play a critical role in tgf-β <dig> induced mmt and peritoneal fibrosis in pd, although detailed mechanisms pertaining to mesothelial pathobiology remained to be work out. much of the work in this regard has been focused on tubular epithelial cell biology.

emerging evidence shows that the pi3k/akt pathway is another non-smad pathway contributing to tgf-β induced emt  <cit> . pi3k/akt modulates tgf-β1-induced emt in renal tubular cells  <cit> . tgf-β apparently causes phosphorylation of akt, which seems to be required for tgf-β-induced emt  <cit> . moreover, ly <dig>  an inhibitor of pi3k/akt, can attenuate insulin-induced pi <dig> kinase-dependent akt phosphorylation and reduce apoptosis in peritoneal mesothelial cells  <cit> . treatment with ly <dig> also significantly reduces tgf-β1-stimulated col1a <dig> promoter activity and expression, as well as diminishes the effect of vegf and thus conceivably inhibits emt transformation in renal tubular epithelial cells  <cit> . furthermore, tgf-β induced down-regulation of e-cadherin in renal tubular epithelial cells has been reported following the treatment with ly <dig>  suggesting that akt may play a key role in tgf-β induced emt transformation  <cit> . in addition, pi3k/akt pathway regulates tgf-β signaling cascade by inducing smad <dig> expression  <cit> . however, whether akt is involved in the process of tgf-β induce mmt in pd by modulating the pathobiology of mesothelial cells is uncertain. also, the mechanisms by which akt mediates mmt coupled fibrosis in pd or by tgf-β <dig> stimulating peritoneal mesothelial cells have not been so far clearly delineated.

certainly, it is known that tgf-β family members transduce signals through membrane serine/threonine kinase receptors and intracellular smad proteins including smad2/ <dig> which are regulated by smad <dig> via e <dig> ubiquitin ligases, such as, smurf <dig>  <cit> . in addition, tgf-β stimulates smurf <dig> promoter activity and its expression by a smad-independent pathway, such as, the pi3k/akt pathway  <cit> . smurf <dig> contains three ww domains, which can bind to the smad <dig> py motif region and form a complex  <cit> . after smurf <dig> binding to smad <dig> it is exported to the membrane of cells, where it causes degradation of smad <dig> and tgb-β <dig> receptor  <cit> . furthermore, in the presence of tgf-β signaling the degradation of smad <dig> is dependent on the catalytic activity of the smurf <dig> hect domain  <cit> . recently, tan ry et al. found that smurf <dig> expression is significantly increased upon tgf-β <dig> stimulation, and over-expression of smurf <dig> augmented tgf-β1-mediated e-cadherin suppression in human tubular epithelial cells  <cit> . on the other hand, smad <dig> negatively regulates the tgf-β1/smad pathway  <cit> . overexpression of smad <dig> has been shown to inhibit angii-induced tgf-β/smad activation and emt in nrk52e cells and in a rat model of remnant kidney disease  <cit> . interestingly, transfer of smad <dig> gene by ultrasound microbubble method into the peritoneum inhibits smad2/ <dig> activation, decreases α-sma expression, and attenuates peritoneal fibrosis in a rat model of pd  <cit> . taken together the data of above indicated studies, it seems that the activation of tgf-β1-akt-smurf2-smad <dig> pathway may mediate mmt in pd. thus, we hypothesized that activation of akt by tgf-β <dig> increases smurf <dig> expression which would inhibit smad <dig>  and thus akt could participate in tgf-β1-induced mmt and peritoneal fibrosis in mice undergoing pd.

to address all these myriad of issues, in vivo and in vitro studies were carried out in pd mice model and hpmcs by the multitude of methods, including tissue morphology, real time pcr, immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses. we observed that the expression and activity of pakt and smurf <dig> were increased in the peritoneum of pd mice while smad <dig> was decreased . in addition, pakt expression rapidly increased in the nuclear compartment in a dose-dependent manner in hpmcs subjected to tgf-β <dig> , which was accompanied with altered of smurf <dig>  smad <dig> and mmt-relevant proteins’ expression . the altered expression of smurf <dig>  smad <dig> and emt relevant proteins in the peritoneum of pd mice was reversed following in vivo treatment with ly <dig> , and so was case when tgf-β1-induced hpmcs were treated in vitro with ly <dig> or transfected with flag-akt or akt-dn expression plasmids . these observations clearly indicate that the activation of pakt induces mmt transformation during pd and it mediated via the increased expression of smurf <dig> with simultaneous down-regulation of smad <dig> 

the next question that needs to be addressed pertains to the status of tgf-β <dig> receptor during mmt transformation. tgf-β signaling pathway is tightly regulated through protein ubiquitination, e.g., trβ <dig> degradation. it is known that levels of tβri at the cell surface are regulated by smurf 2/smad <dig> complex, and the stability of this receptor determines the status of tgf-β signaling  <cit> . in this regard, it has been shown that the treatment with tβr-i inhibitor suppresses the lymphangiogenesis and vegf-c expression in a murine model of peritoneal fibrosis  <cit> . with respect to tβr-i pathobiology, extensive studies carried out in the past in a vast number of systems indicate that there is a crosstalk between pi3k/akt and tgf-β signaling pathways, which at times counteract while in other situations cooperate with one another  <cit> . recently eichhorn et al. using a functional rnai screen identified the deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific protease  <dig>  as a key component of the tgf-β signaling pathway  <cit> . usp <dig> binds to smurf <dig> complex and deubiquitinates and stabilizes trβ <dig>  and that apparently leads to boosting of tgf-β-mediated signaling. likewise usp <dig> as a deubiquitylating enzyme also interacts with tβri at the plasma membrane and reverses its ubiquitination and thus regulates the tβri levels  <cit> . conceivably, akt directly interacts with usp <dig> for its phosphorylation and translocates nuclear usp <dig> to the membrane and thus maintains tβri stability and possibly modulates tgf-β induced emt/mmt.

in reference to the role of smurf <dig> and usp <dig> in mmt in pd. our data indeed show that there is some modulation by the akt in downstream signaling. to verify the effect of akt regulation on mmt in pd, smurf <dig> sirna and usp <dig> sirna experiments were carried out in hpmcs. results showed that inhibition of usp <dig> and smurf <dig> expression significantly reverses the altered expression of zo- <dig>  vimentin and tβri induced by tgf-β <dig>  while overexpression of akt augments these effects. transfection with usp <dig> sirna or smurf <dig> sirna also inhibited the effect exerted by tgfβ1+ akt on the expression of tβri, zo- <dig> and vimentin . additionally, to address the issue that whether akt and usp <dig> regulate the interaction between smurf <dig> and smad <dig>  and smurf <dig> and tβri induced by tgf-β <dig>  immunoprecipitation/western blot assays were carried out. they revealed that akt-dn and usp <dig> sirna can disrupt their association in hpmcs treated with tgf-β <dig> . this indicated that akt may regulate mmt in pd via various signaling pathways which involve the smurf2/usp4/tβri complex.

CONCLUSIONS
the findings of the current study highlights the activation of akt mediated emt/mmt transformation in pd via smurf <dig> modulation/and or smad <dig> degradation while conceivably maintaining the tβri stability, most likely by the usp <dig>  the findings also suggest that akt plays a central role in mmt and fibrosis during pd through smurf2/smad <dig> and usp4/tβri pathway or their interaction . it is anticipated that this information may provide potential therapeutic molecular targets for the amelioration of peritoneal fibrosis in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.figure  <dig>
