BACKGROUND
snps  are genetic markers of choice for both linkage and association mapping and for population structure and evolution analysis. they are virtually unlimited, evenly distributed along the genome, bi-allelic and co-dominant. massive snp discovery was first limited to the few species with an available reference genome. recently, with the advances in cheaper next generation sequencing  technologies, various accessions within species even with complex genomes could be sequenced  <cit> . the challenge of sequencing large genomes with high levels of repeated sequences first led to the development of novel approaches for reducing genome complexity  <cit> . cdna sequencing, which specifically addresses the expressed genic fraction, was largely developed and reviewed in duarte et al.  <cit> . restriction site associated dna  tags have been applied to a large range of organisms such as drosophila melanogaster  <cit> , fish and fungi  <cit> . in plants, rad-seq has been applied to a number of species for both large-scale snp discovery and the mapping of snp subsets in barley  <cit>  and rye-grass  <cit> . in legume species, deokar et al.  <cit>  first reported the use of rad-seq in chickpea to discover  <dig>  snps and subsequently map  <dig> recombination bins. restriction enzyme digest to reduce genome complexity followed by direct genotyping-by-sequencing was reported for maize rils and barley doubled haploid lines  <cit> , where  <dig>  markers were eventually mapped on the barley genetic map. in legume species, sonah et al.  <cit>  first used gbs in soybean to develop  <dig>  high quality snps. thus all these studies used genome reduction and various assembling tools.

pea is the third production in the world among temperate grain legume crops after soybean and common bean and is a major source of protein for humans and livestock. pea is particularly relevant in temperate cropping systems due to its capacity to fix nitrogen through symbiosis. nevertheless, the species suffers from significant yield instability due to its high susceptibility to abiotic and biotic stresses, among which aphanomyces root rot disease, due to the oomycete aphanomyces euteiches drechs. resistance quantitative trait loci  have been described, but the qtl confidence intervals are still large, especially due to the lack of markers and low resolution of existing genetic maps. it remains a challenge to reduce qtl confidence intervals, to discover underlying candidate genes and develop breeding programs using molecular markers strongly associated with phenotypes.

although pea has actually entered the genomic era  <cit> , it still suffers from limited genomic resources compared to other crops. the pea genome is  <dig>  gb, which is around  <dig> times larger than the genome of the model species m.truncatula  <cit> . this includes repeats mostly derived from transposon-based sequences  <cit> . recent reports indicated that large new sequencing resources are under development  <cit>  and that a consortium for pea genome sequencing is at work , however no full genome sequence is available yet. large numbers of new molecular markers are still needed to saturate pea maps and significantly improve qtl mapping both for research and breeding objectives. although transcriptome sequencing has recently been used in pea for snp discovery  <cit>  and mapping  <cit> , available genetic maps remain at low to medium density, and are mainly based on a few hundred ssrs  <cit>  and on a few hundred  <cit>  up to a few thousand  <cit>  snps, usually developed through dedicated genotyping facilities. the development of larger resources is therefore required for mapping and genetic improvement purposes.

to complement the existing resources, our objective was to develop a comprehensive snp resource in pea using genotyping by hiseq sequencing of whole genome dna and then to apply it for substantial genetic mapping. to our knowledge, this is the first report, in a species lacking a sequenced reference genome, of a whole genome genomic dna sequencing strategy for high-throughput snp discovery, genotyping  and genetic mapping. this novel approach was carried out at low sequence coverage, without prior genome complexity reduction and without sequence read assembly, on a ril population segregating for a.euteiches resistance. the quality of the snps was then validated through genotyping using a benchmark technology  <cit> . this was made possible by optimizing snp discovery tools that can work without data assembly or a reference genome  <cit> , and developing appropriate tools to map very large numbers of snps from mapping populations comprising a few individuals  <cit> .

RESULTS
snp discovery and selection of a subset of highly designable markers
to maximize the identification of relevant polymorphic snps, four genetically distant p. sativum genotypes were selected for genomic dna preparation and hiseq sequencing. these were the parental lines of the ‘champagne’ x ‘terese’ and ‘baccara’ x ‘pi180693’ ril mapping populations. raw and pre-processed sequencing data analysis across the four samples showed low levels of contamination, and unexpectedly low levels of sequence repeats. in addition, considering that the nuclei were not isolated prior to dna extraction, there were also rather low levels of organelle contaminants . the final clean sequences represented  <dig> to  <dig> % of the raw sequence data depending on the genotype .

from a total of  <dig>  billion cleaned reads from four p. sativum lines, the discosnp tool identified  <dig>  snps. a “post-discosnp” filtering step, based on the availability of sequence data for all the four lines, homozygozity of each pea line, global sequence coverage and minor allele coverage, was used to remove putative “false heterozygous” and multilocus snps. finally,  <dig>  snps considered as robust for genotyping were selected. most of them showed coverage between 6x and 14x , which was consistent with the corresponding sequencing coverage for each line at approximately 7-fold the pea estimated genome size . as expected discosnp filtering excluded snps with less than 5x coverage . to optimize potential future goldengate® or kasp™ genotyping assay designs, only  <dig>  snps were retained in two subsets of   <dig>  snps with a context sequence showing no other polymorphism at least  <dig> bp on either side of the snp    <dig>  snps with a context sequence showing no other polymorphism at least  <dig> bp on one side of the snp and no other polymorphism at least  <dig> bp on the other side . within the resulting  <dig>  snps, polymorphic snps between pairs of parental lines ranged from  <dig>  between the two spring sown field pea lines ‘baccara’ and ‘terese’ to over  <dig>  between each of these two lines and the fodder pea genotype ‘champagne’ .table  <dig> number of snps that were polymorphic between sequenced pairs of pea parental lines, from a subset of  <dig>  highly or very highly designable snps



snp inferring on the ‘baccara’ x ‘pi180693’ ril mapping population
forty-eight p. sativum rils from the ‘baccara’ x ‘pi180693’ mapping population were selected for genomic dna extraction, hiseq sequencing and genotyping.

raw and pre-processed sequencing data analysis  across the  <dig> rils was consistent with previous sequence analysis on the four parental lines, even with the twofold lower sequencing effort on the rils  than on the parental lines .

a total of  <dig>  snps  were polymorphic between the ‘baccara’ and pi180693’ parental lines. the kissreads module  <cit>  of the discosnp tool was then used to infer which of these snps were present in the  <dig> rils. most of these  <dig>  snps showed coverage ranging between 3x and 7x . this is consistent with the sequencing coverage for each of the  <dig> rils of approximately  <dig> -fold the estimated pea genome size .  <dig>  snps were genotyped on all of the  <dig> sequenced rils . a total of  <dig>  snps, which showed less than ten missing data points and less than  <dig> % of heterozygous data points among the  <dig> sequenced rils, was retained.fig.  <dig> frequency histogram of the number of missing data points in wggbs of  <dig> rils with the  <dig>  reliable snps that are polymorphic between the ‘baccara’ and ‘pi180693’ parentals 



a strict alignment of snp context sequences with the glint tool  showed that only  <dig> snps are  <dig> % identical between the  <dig>  snp set developed by duarte et al.  <cit> , and the  <dig>  ‘baccara’ x ‘pi180693’ polymorphic snp set generated in this study. only  <dig> snps were found to be identical between the  <dig> ‘baccara’ x ‘pi180693’ polymorphic snp set genotyped in a goldengate® assay and mapped to the duarte et al.  <cit>  reference consensus map, and the  <dig>  ‘baccara’ x ‘pi180693’ polymorphic snp set retained in this study from snp inferring on the  <dig> rils. genotyping data obtained with both methods  for the  <dig> common snps were identical for  <dig> snps, apart from a few missing data with each method and a few heterozygous loci identified with wggbs but not goldengate®. the remaining six snps totally failed in the goldengate® assay but were successfully genotyped by direct sequencing .

high density genetic maps
a first genetic ‘baccara’ x ‘pi180693’ duarte-derived map , was constructed from the ‘baccara’ x ‘pi180693’ polymorphic markers used in hamon et al.  <cit>  and duarte et al.  <cit> . positions of the resulting  <dig> mapped markers, covering  <dig> cm, were generally colinear with those of the reference consensus map  <cit> . linkage group  lengths in cm were either similar or smaller in the bp-duarte map than in the consensus map .table  <dig> comparative marker numbers, maps lengths and marker distributions per linkage group between the bp-wggbs, the bp-duarte and the consensus duarte et al.  <cit>  maps



a second high-density ‘baccara’ x ‘pi180693’ wggbs-derived map , including  <dig>  markers and covering  <dig> cm, was constructed from genotyping data used for the bp-duarte genetic map by adding the data for the selection of  <dig>  snps “genotyped-by-sequencing” on the  <dig> ‘baccara’ x ‘pi180693’ rils  to the previous matrix. this genetic map included  <dig> previously mapped markers and  <dig>   newly mapped genomic snps. snp context sequences, genotyping data on parental lines and positions on the new bp-wggbs of the  <dig>  newly mapped genomic snps are described in additional file 4: table s <dig>  detailed mapping and polymorphism data in the  <dig> ‘baccara’x‘pi180693’ rils are included in additional file 5: table s <dig> 

this new bp-wggbs map showed an average density of  <dig>  markers per cm. marker density was very high for all p. sativum lgs , and ranged from  <dig> markers/cm  to  <dig> markers/cm  . overall, new snp markers were usually densely and homogeneously distributed along the seven pea lgs, with a few notable exceptions:  two large areas remained without markers, i.e. two gaps larger than  <dig> cm between two contiguous markers , located on pslgi and pslgii ,  several spots showed  <dig> to  <dig> markers at the same genetic position, on pslgi, pslgii, pslgiii , and pslgvii. pslgvi showed a “staircase” curve alternating marker dense and marker poor areas .fig.  <dig> dot-plot of marker distribution along the p. sativum linkage groups. a flatter curve indicates a region denser in markers. the red vertical ellipses indicate gaps without markers. the blue horizontal ellipses indicate hot-spots of markers at the same genetic position



overall,  <dig>  % of the newly developed snps showed segregation distortion  among the  <dig> ‘baccara’ x ‘pi180693’ derived rils . most of the distorted markers clustered into genomic regions, mainly on pslgs ii , iii , iv , v  and vii . markers in a defined cluster always distorted towards one of the parental lines . pslgi and pslgvi showed negligible proportions of distorted markers.

positions of the  <dig> markers common to the bp-duarte and bp-wggbs maps were colinear between the two maps, as well as with their published positions on the duarte et al. consensus map  <cit>  . except for a few local inversions, colinearity of these markers was maintained along the three maps. map sizes were similar between the bp-duarte and bp-wggbs maps , and significantly lower than the size of the duarte et al.  <cit>  reference consensus map from four populations . the number of mapped markers in the bp-wggbs map was increased 31-fold and 70-fold compared to the consensus reference  and to the bp-duarte maps .

snp inferring on other pea parental lines
snp inferring on four supplementary sequenced parental lines showed that coverage of most of the  <dig>  snps as expected ranged between 6x and 13x . among these the  <dig>  newly mapped snps indicated a fair to high level of polymorphism between four other pairs of mapping population parents, ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % . the snp context sequence and polymorphism data for the eight p. sativum parents of the mapping populations are described in additional file 4: table s <dig> table  <dig> percentage of polymorphic snps among the  <dig>  newly developed snps mapped to the bp-wggbs map, between five pairs of parental lines of pea mapping populations




selection and validation of a snp sub-set in a kasp™ genotyping assay
based on mapping positions within qtl confidence intervals for biotic stress resistance and polymorphism data, we selected  <dig> snps out of the  <dig>  mapped on the bp-wggbs map. these were used for genotyping  <dig> samples corresponding to  <dig> different pea accessions , in a kasp™  <dig> -well plate format assay .

among these  <dig> snps selected,  <dig>  failed due to missing or non-readable signals. successful genotyping results were obtained with the other  <dig> snps , among which  <dig>  revealed the bi-allelic codominant polymorphism expected in the ‘baccara’ x ‘pi180693’ ril population. the remaining four markers  revealed a dominant polymorphism probably due to a failed probe design.

the  <dig> , <dig> genotyping data points consisted of  <dig>  % homozygous loci for alleles from ‘baccara’,  <dig>  % homozygous loci for alleles from ‘pi180693’,  <dig>  % heterozygous loci, and  <dig>  % unassigned data . the entire polymorphism data set generated by the kasp™ genotyping assay in the eight sequenced pea parental lines and  <dig> f1s from crosses between pairs of these lines is described in additional file 8: table s <dig> 

forty-five thousand seven hundred forty-four comparisons were made between kasp™ and wggbs genotyping data obtained with  <dig> snps on  <dig> rils. although there were higher levels of unassigned data generated with wggbs than kasp™ genotyping, both methods gave very similar results for the  <dig> rils genotypes . conflicting data between the two methods remained below  <dig>  % and included data:  where one method assigned a homozygote but the other a heterozygote , and which were mostly loci lying within regions showing residual heterozygosity and could therefore be re-assigned as heterozygotes;  showing two different homozygotes assigned by either method , most of which  clustered in specific areas of a single ril  and may therefore correspond to a seed divergence and the remaining  that could be true genotyping errors from either method .

discussion
in this study, we discovered  <dig>  genomic snps in whole genome sequences of four pea lines, but without prior genome reduction or sequence assembly. among them,  <dig>  appear robust for genotyping. for the first time in pea a wggbs-derived map was produced. it contains  <dig>  markers including  <dig>  new genomic snps added to  <dig> other markers that allowed this new high-density genetic map to be aligned to a previously published reference consensus map .

whole genome dna sequencing: a strategy without genome reduction for high density development of markers in an orphan species
snp development strategies usually call for a genome reduction step, either focusing on the expressed fraction of the genome, using tags or methylation at restriction sites, or capture, in order to produce sequencing data with a sufficient coverage to avoid false polymorphisms. although the pea genome is large  and thought to contain a large proportion of repeated sequences, we chose not to go through this genome reduction step and to work on direct whole genome dna sequencing, associated with reduced coverage thresholds to validate the snps. this strategy generated more than ten billion  <dig> bp high quality reads from eight pea lines and  <dig> rils, with a high level of polymorphism validation in other sequenced parental lines or in derived rils. results of the cleaning process were consistent for all lines, except ‘baccara’ which was not etiolated prior to tissue sampling. the unexpectedly low level of repeated sequences  could be because the mapping parameters in the cleaning method were very stringent or some pea genome repeated sequences are under-represented in the repbase and genbank databases. regardless, the remaining repeated sequences were taken into consideration during snp discovery with the discosnp tool and post discosnp filtering processes. thus we did not observe high snp coverage that could have corresponded to organelle or repeated sequence regions . the upcoming availability of the whole pea genome sequence will give further insights into the quantity and nature of its repeated sequences  <cit> .

snp calling without data assembly and without a reference genome
for a genomic snp discovery approach, a tool appropriate for a large genome without reference sequence and a large amount of data was a prerequisite. we therefore used discosnp software  <cit>  that filled the specifications for snp discovery from non-assembled reads. this tool, designed for calling snps from any number of input read sets, avoids the assembly and mapping processes, and therefore needed very limited time and memory to process ten billion reads. snp discovery on the four parental lines only needed  <dig> cpu,  <dig> gb ram and  <dig> h. snp inferring with the kissreads module of discosnp on the  <dig> rils used  <dig> cpu,  <dig> gb ram and  <dig> h. discosnp outputs pairs of sequences in a fasta file. sequences in the pair differ by a unique isolated nucleotide polymorphism, ie without any other polymorphisms in the context sequence on either side of the snp. although this is a strong limitation to the comprehensive detection of all possible snps, it is perfect for specifically selecting snps that can be directly used to design snp-based assays for genotyping such as illumina goldengate®, lgc kasp™ or affymetrix axiom®.

the header of the discosnp output sequences contains information about the read quality and coverage of each of the two alleles in each of the input read sets. thus we could apply filters specifically adjusted to our biological parameters. one filter removed false heterozygotes  due to low coverage and low depth of whole genome sequencing data. another filter, based on the coverage of the minor allele for snps detected on four pea lines, was used to remove questionable snps for complexity, multilocus status, copy number variations, or potential location in genome repeats. after this stringent filtering step, around  <dig> % of the  <dig>  snps for all four pea parental lines were retained. this is a much higher figure than currently reported for gbs strategies which usually result in high levels of missing sequence data and a large percentage of uncalled genotypes  <cit> . indeed, whole genome sequencing  inherently provides very good quality sequence data that are more comprehensive than gbs. however the combined use of a tool such as discosnp and a “post-discosnp” specific filtering strategy were needed for efficient snp discovery process. furthermore, the level of missing data after sequencing  <dig> rils was also very low, with  <dig>   snps showing less than  <dig> % missing sequence data . to our knowledge this is the first study conducted using discosnp on a real data set of reads from hiseq sequencing. it had been previously used on a much smaller  <dig> read set after reduction of the ixodes ricinus genome, to detect “ready to genotype” snps  <cit> .

only  <dig> of the  <dig>  newly discovered polymorphic snps  were in common with the  <dig>  gene-based snps developed by duarte et al.  <cit> . this may be due to  relatively lower coverage and lower sequencing depth provided in this study,  the specific detection of only isolated snps by discosnp. recently, alves carvalho et al. compared three snp calling methods, including discosnp, on the same set of sequence data. each detected the same numbers of robust snps, but only a quarter of the snps were in common in the three sets and only half between two sets  <cit> .

validation of the wggbs genotyping strategy using a snp kasp™ genotyping assay
despite the rather low average sequencing coverage in snp discovery  and in further snp inferring , several biological and technical observations confirmed the robustness of our strategy and showed its full efficiency in revealing reliable and designable snps. the polymorphism levels revealed between pairs of lines were consistent with previously described genetic distances between these lines  <cit> . indeed, polymorphism levels were lower for ‘baccara’/‘terese’ than for ‘baccara’/‘champagne’, ‘champagne’/‘terese’ or ‘baccara’/‘pi180693’. ‘baccara’ and ‘terese’ belong to the spring field pea group, ‘champagne’ to the winter fodder pea group, and ‘pi180693’ to the garden pea group. similarly, genotyping data for the  <dig> snps in common with the  <dig> snp set genotyped in a goldengate® assay and mapped by duarte et al. were entirely consistent with the  <dig>  genomic snps generated and genotyped-by-sequencing in this study . furthermore, almost all of the  <dig>  snps polymorphic between ‘baccara’ and ‘pi180693’ were successfully genotyped on the ril population . genotyping of  <dig> different pea accessions with a subset of  <dig> snps  using the kasp™ technology also revealed a very high rate of  <dig> true and reliable snps . thus, the chosen strategy of low average sequencing coverage  followed by discosnp-based snps discovery was fully validated.

finally, genotyping data obtained with both kasp™ and wggbs methods for the  <dig> snps on the  <dig> rils were very similar. the level of missing data , as well as the  <dig>  % inconsistent data between methods, suggests that wggbs is less robust in heterozygote discrimination, probably due to the low sequencing depth. however, wggbs was highly efficient and robust in revealing homozygous genotypes. thus we confirmed that the low average sequencing coverage  coupled with the use of the kissreads module of discosnp inferred robust and reliable genotyping data.

high-density genetic map construction from a p. sativum ril population
most developments in genotyping techniques in the last ten years have been clearly associated with multiplexing large numbers of markers  for each plant analyzed. wggbs approaches tend to also provide huge quantities of snp allele information for each plant. this leads to new challenges when building linkage maps. the main problem is that the number of plants in the mapping population is always far too small for a robust ordering of all the polymorphic markers. thus, two distinct objectives have to be considered to produce:  a robust map with the largest possible number of markers  for which the order is statistically supported for a given lod threshold; and  a “complete map” in which all polymorphic markers are given a position, but without the order between markers being statistically supported . another technical problem is the need for most mapping software to load the whole set of marker segregation data in memory, which makes it impossible to work with data sets beyond a certain size. the pipeline used in this study, developed in response to these different challenges, makes it possible to build both framework maps with orders supported by a lod threshold and complete maps saturating the genomic space with all polymorphic markers  <cit> . thus the map is suitable for qtl detection, gwas and genomic selection approaches. in addition, marker data are loaded sequentially in small batches, so there is no limit to the number of markers, regardless of computer memory size. this sequential approach needs a much shorter computation time compared to the direct use of the annealing command of the carhta gene tool: about  <dig> h were needed to map  <dig>  snps on the seven pslgs, whereas annealing commands in carhta gene would probably have taken months or years. we are currently working on parallelizing the code for multicore computers to further reduce this computation time.

this pipeline allowed us to generate the first high-density pea genetic map mainly based on snps developed and genotyped by sequencing whole genome genomic dna from a ril population. the map size obtained was significantly smaller than those observed in previous reference composite maps  <cit> , and similar to the sizes of recently reported individual maps  <cit>  and the bp-duarte individual map , but with a more than 70-fold increase in marker density. a very high level of colinearity was observed for the markers that were in common with other p. sativum composite  <cit>  or individual  maps. thus the newly developed bp-wggbs map is a useful tool for future studies focusing on variation in a given genomic region in pea.

a  <dig>  % segregation distortion  was observed for the newly developed snps among the  <dig> ‘baccara’x‘pi180693’ derived rils. this figure is very close to the  <dig> % identified for  <dig> markers in the ‘baccara’/‘pi180693’/‘552’ consensus map  <cit>  and the  <dig>  % identified for snps in the ‘baccara’ x ‘pi180693’ individual population data  <cit> . however it is much lower than the segregation distortion observed in other individual pea populations where large numbers of snps were genotyped and mapped  <cit> . the much higher marker number involved and the high resolution of the bp-wggbs map allowed regions of segregation distortion to be identified in this population towards one or the other parental line, probably carrying detrimental lethal or sublethal alleles. although the two parental lines are actually genetically distant  <cit> , sterility barriers were not noted in the ril production and fixation process. it is possible however that gametic or zygotic selection did take place and the issue of whether floral development or fertility genes lie in these regions still needs to be addressed. genotypic data for distorted markers was not specifically considered during the mapping process. it is possible therefore that some marker order inversions occur in the distorted regions. however, considering that all the markers are not distorted in a specific region and the wggbs-derived map aligns well with other maps , such inversions are probably localized and infrequent. information on marker distortion combined with future knowledge of localized recombination hot and cold spots, is of vital interest for some of the genomic regions that control traits of interest in this population. these are currently transferred through back-cross assisted breeding from ‘baccara’ x ‘pi180693’ rils to field pea spring and winter sown elite genetic backgrounds  <cit> . interestingly a  <dig> cm gap on pslgii separated two regions where markers showed distortions towards either parental line. although a single marker ensures the link between these two regions, it is validated by other individual ‘baccara’ x ‘pi180693’ maps  or consensus maps where the gap was also observed  <cit>  or not  <cit> . it is likely that in this region showing no recombination a chromosomal rearrangement occurred in the ‘baccara’ x ‘pi180693’ population.

by choosing to sequence whole genomic dna, we developed a large original resource of genomic snp markers corresponding to genic and extra-genic sequences distributed all along the pea genome. like genomic ssrs, but unlike cdna-derived snps, it can be considered as neutral regarding evolutionary selection pressure. this was confirmed by the dense and homogeneous distribution of newly developed snp markers along the seven pea lgs. a remaining  <dig> cm gap on pslgii  corresponds to a misassembly of two large blocks more than  <dig> cm apart, or to a  <dig> cm region without polymorphic markers between ‘baccara’ and ‘pi180693’ comprising three gaps of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  cm on two previous reference consensus maps  <cit> . interestingly no such gap was observed on the sindhu et al. consensus map  <cit>  that did not include the ‘baccara’ x ‘pi180693’ ril population. furthermore, the atypical distribution of markers along the pslgvi with a “staircase” curve alternating marker dense and marker poor areas , is consistent with what we know of the complex synteny with m.truncatula pseudo chromosomes  <dig> &  <dig>  <cit> .

a comprehensive tool for academic research and breeding in pea: the case of an a. euteiches resistance qtl
sequencing and mapping a ril population segregating for partial resistance to a. euteiches should lead to breakthroughs in the study of qtls involved in a.euteiches resistance  <cit> . there is now the potential for densification, fine mapping and candidate gene identification within the qtl confidence intervals. in addition, alignment of the bp-wggbs map with the duarte et al.  <cit>  consensus map  <cit> , anchors some of the markers to the genome of the model species m.truncatula, and opens the way for large-scale syntenic studies. the “metaqtl” area described by hamon et al.  <cit>  on a pslgvii region corresponding to flowering metaqtl morpho <dig>  and a. euteiches resistance metaqtls ae <dig> and ae <dig> is for instance defined between the ssr markers aa <dig> and ab <dig>  this region originally covered  <dig>  cm and included eight markers. now it covers a much shorter genetic distance  and includes  <dig>  markers on the ‘bp-wggbs’ map. the upper section of this region  can also be linked to a  <dig>  mb region of m.truncatula chromosome  <dig> using around  <dig> gene-derived bridge markers . mapping, alignment and redetection of a.euteiches resistance qtl from hamon et al.  <cit>  are currently in progress  <cit> .fig.  <dig> marker densification in a metaqtl region controlling partial resistance to a.euteiches between the ssr aa <dig> and ab <dig> reference markers on pslgvii. the left hand side shows this region on the duarte et al.  <cit>  consensus map and its projection on m. truncatula pseudochromosome  <dig> . the center shows the same region on the two individual bp-duarte and bp-wggbs maps, covering respectively  <dig> cm and  <dig>  cm. the right hand side shows the same region, detailed in hamon et al.  <cit> , covering  <dig>  cm and corresponding to three metaqtls morpho <dig>  ae <dig> and ae <dig> 



the alignment of this new bp-wggbs map to the consensus reference map  <cit>  from four ril populations including ‘baccara’ x ‘pi180693’ , will also facilitate the use of the snp resource to fine map genomic regions and qtls associated with traits of interest identified from other ril populations where maps with common markers are available  <cit> . as shown by the level of polymorphism observed in five pairs of mapping population parents  from sequencing only four pea lines , any pea line can be rapidly and cheaply sequenced to obtain polymorphism information for the newly developed and mapped snps. for example, the pslgvi region bordered by ps <dig> and fve markers including a major qtl for winter frost damage  <cit>  and syntenic with a  <dig>  mb region on the mtrchr <dig>  <cit>  potentially includes  <dig>  markers from the bp-wggbs map.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a major genomic snp marker resource was generated. it will be extremely valuable in future research of the genetic control of traits of interest, and breeding for the introgression and management of these traits into cultivated gene pools. the results show that it is now possible to generate and map reliable snp markers in a plant species with a large unsequenced genome. the novelty of our approach included using whole sequencing without genome reduction, direct snp discovery excluding sequence assembly, and a sequential mapping approach to handle tens of thousands of markers. the entire set can be used in single gene, association, or linkage mapping studies to capture new qtls and refine qtl localizations. this can be done in any pea genetic background since mapping alignments are provided and the markers show high levels of polymorphism in alien backgrounds. the resource can also be screened in linkage studies  aimed at specific regions when generating large segregating populations. finally, we generated a large choice of polymorphic markers internal to and bordering qtl confidence intervals. these provide an unprecedented tool for marker assisted selection.
