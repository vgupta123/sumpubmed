BACKGROUND
predicting gene function is a major goal of systems molecular biology in the post genome sequencing era. in this context, the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae has emerged as the eukaryotic model organism of choice for large-scale functional genomic investigations. yeast cells have been subjected to a number of high throughput investigations such as gene expression analysis  <cit> , protein-protein interaction mapping  <cit>  and synthetic genetic interaction analysis  <cit> . much knowledge relating to the functions of yeast genes has been collated but a significant number of genes are still not characterized in this model organism  <cit> . consequently, further studies are required to examine the function of uncharacterized genes, and to investigate novel function for genes that are not fully characterized.

increased sensitivity of gene deletion mutant strains to inhibitory compounds has been used extensively to study gene functions  <cit> . this approach is partly based on the theory that in general, the presence of redundant pathways compensates for genetic inactivation of a single pathway, with no phenotypic consequence  <cit> . however, the inactivity of a second functionally overlapping pathway, in this case using a chemical treatment, can cause a "double hit" effect and result in a phenotypic consequence that can be scored as a reduction in the rate of growth, or a sick/sensitive phenotype  <cit> . similarly, such chemical-genetic profile analyses can be used to study cellular target sites of various bioactive compounds  <cit> , pharmaceuticals  <cit>  and herbal extracts  <cit>  whose mechanisms of action are unknown.

in general, chemical sensitivity profiling of yeast gene knockouts can be studied using three complementary high throughput approaches. in the first case, deletion mutants can be grown individually in liquid cultures and their growth rates monitored spectrophotometrically using a microplate reader. the growth curve of micro-cultivated mutant strains in the presence and absence of a bioactive compound is used to determine strain sensitivity  <cit> . the second approach is based on synthetic lethality analysis on microarray   <cit> . a pool of tagged deletion strains are grown in the presence and absence of the target compounds. owing to the presence of a specific barcode in each mutant strain, the relative growth of each strain can be determined using microarray methodology, and sensitivity is measured on the basis of the relative growth of a specific mutant strain in the presence of other strains. the third approach concerns colonies of yeast gene deletion mutant strains being arrayed on solid media in the presence and absence of the target compounds  <cit> . the growth rates of individual colonies are estimated by their relative colony size relative to a control. each of these techniques has inherent advantages and disadvantages. the results obtained from these methodologies are considered to be complementary  <cit> .

recently, we showed that high throughput chemical sensitivity profile analysis of yeast gene knockout strains to paromomycin can be used to study novel gene functions, and reported that a previously uncharacterized open reading frame, tae <dig>  has a novel role in protein biosynthesis or translation  <cit> . in the present study, colony size reduction was used to screen and analyze the yeast gene knockout collection for their sensitivity to five bioactive compounds that target the process of protein biosynthesis. we followed up by studying the activities of three profiled genes for their involvements in protein biosynthesis and termed them tae <dig>  tae <dig> and tae <dig> for translation associated elements 2- <dig> 

RESULTS
drug sensitivity screens
the entire collection of the haploid yeast gene deletion array   was screened for increased sensitivity to the bioactive compounds cycloheximide, 3-amino- <dig> ,4-triazole , paromomycin, streptomycin and neomycin. these drugs have reported involvement in protein biosynthesis or translation. cycloheximide is a glutarimide antibiotic that binds to the  <dig> s ribosomal subunit and inhibits translation elongation  <cit> . 3-at is a competitive inhibitor of imidazole glycerol phosphate dehydratase, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the amino acid histidine  <cit> , and causes amino acid starvation  <cit> . paromomycin, neomycin and streptomycin are known to bind the small ribosomal subunit of eukaryotic cells, inhibit ribosomal translocation and compromise translation fidelity  <cit> . we hypothesized that sensitivity to these drugs could be used as a method of identifying new genes associated with the process of protein biosynthesis. sub-inhibitory concentrations of the drugs were used in this study. under these growth conditions only strains with increased sensitivity would demonstrate growth reduction and the growth of the remaining strains would be largely unaffected. each experiment was repeated three times and the total number of analyses exceeded  <dig> . we have previously reported analysis concerning sensitivity to paromomycin  <cit> . here, we present the collective analysis of the total data from the entire collection of sensitive strains.

colony size  measurement was used to determine sensitivity. the relative colony growths  on treated plates were compared with those grown under control conditions  as described previously  <cit> . cs measurement is an established method used to identify drug sensitive strains  <cit>  and is reported to identify approximately 63% of sensitive strains detected by standard large-scale spot test  analysis  <cit> . therefore, a number of sensitive strains that could be detected using st analysis may not have been detected using cs, indicating that our approach using cs to identify sensitivity is not exhaustive. furthermore, it is reported that 59% of the sensitive strains detected by cs are not detected by st and hence may represent novel/false positives.

to reduce false positive results, gene deletion strains with sensitivity to different unrelated bioactive compounds that we continuously observed in our previous independent screens, as well as those reported by others  <cit> , were eliminated from the list of sensitive strains. these genes typically represent multiple-drug resistant genes that are not linked to the cellular target sites of the drugs of interest. inclusion of these genes would complicate the analysis of the molecular activity of the target compounds. the final list of the genes that when deleted increased drug sensitivity to the tested bioactive compounds is presented in additional file  <dig>  there are  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes that, when deleted, confer increased sensitivity to cycloheximide, 3-at, streptomycin, neomycin and paromomycin, respectively. these are non-essential genes that are normally not required for the growth of yeast cells under typical laboratory conditions, suggesting that the slow growth phenotype of the corresponding deletion strains is a direct result of the inhibitory effects of the target drugs. cycloheximide, streptomycin, neomycin and paromomycin bind to ribosomes and cause defects in protein synthesis  <cit> . therefore, as expected, among gene deletion strains with increased sensitivity to these drugs, we identified numerous previously characterized protein synthesis related genes including ribosomal protein l27a gene yhr010w , translation initiation factor yjl138c , trna methyltransferase ydl201w , mitochondrial translation initiation factor yol023w  and eif4e-associated gene eap <dig> .

excluding genes with unknown functions, the clustering of the identified genes based on the cellular processes in which they participate is presented in figure 1a . the dominant clusters are protein biosynthesis related genes. for example, approximately 33% of strains sensitive to cycloheximide are linked to protein biosynthesis; approximately 24%, 15%, 13%, 5% and 10% are associated with metabolism, cellular compartments and biogenesis, transport and stress, dna repair and replication, and others, respectively. this was expected as cycloheximide, streptomycin, neomycin and paromomycin are known to interact directly with ribosomal subunits. 3-at also affects protein biosynthesis by altering the available pool of amino acids  <cit> .

smaller clusters could represent additional target sites  of the drugs. for example, neomycin is known to inhibit the phospholipase c pathway and thus interfere with signal transduction in eukaryotic cells  <cit> . this could explain the observation that deletion of yil050w , which codes for a member of a metabolism-associated pho85c kinase complex, confers cell sensitivity to neomycin. the smaller clusters could also represent novel secondary functions for certain genes, some of which may link translation to other cellular processes. for example, deletion of yer095w  or yol090w  increased sensitivity to cycloheximide. yer095w and yol090w are involved in repair of dna strand breaks. interestingly, yer095w is reported to have a genetic interaction  with the translation termination factor erf <dig> gene ydr172w  and the translation elongation factor ylr249w  gene  <cit> , and its product is reported to interact physically with glutamyl trna synthetase protein, ygl245wp   <cit> . similarly, the gene product of yol090w is reported to interact physically with the translation initiation factor eif4a, yjl138c   <cit> . this is in agreement with the recently reported link between dna damage response and translation  <cit> . alternatively, the smaller clusters could represent false positive results. however, the most likely scenario is that each of the aforementioned cases represents a different integrated part of the data. for example, secondary target sites of a drug can be investigated with the prior knowledge that the smaller clusters could contain genes with novel secondary functions as well as a number of false positives. an interesting observation is that the overall distribution of genes within each functional cluster was similar for each of the five drugs investigated herein . this could represent cross-talk between protein synthesis and the other four cellular processes. based on our previous observations of chemical-genomic profiles of other inhibitory compounds with diverse modes of action such as calcoflour white, methyl methane sulfate, and sodium dodecyl sulfate, the profiles presented in figure 1a are distinct .

as utilized previously  <cit> , a hierarchical clustering approach to drug sensitivity was used to analyze the chemical profiles . it is expected that compounds with similar modes of activity have similar profiles with considerable overlaps, and hence cluster together. as expected, the profiles for paromomycin and neomycin had considerable overlaps and hence these compounds were clustered together by hierarchical clustering using complete linkage. these aminoglycosides bind small ribosomal subunits and compromise translation fidelity and translocation. cycloheximide and 3-at also had considerable overlaps and were clustered together as expected; these drugs can affect the elongation phase of translation. cycloheximide does so by binding the  <dig> s ribosomal subunit  <cit>  whereas 3-at causes starvation of amino acids needed for successful elongation. interestingly, streptomycin, an aminoglycoside, had more overlap and was more closely associated with cycloheximide and 3-at. unlike other aminoglycosides, streptomycin does not bind the ribosomal a-site  <cit> , implying that streptomycin binding to the ribosome could result in an alternative ribosomal conformation that resembles the action of cycloheximide and 3-at. the effect of streptomycin on prokaryotic translation elongation, which is different from other aminoglycosides, is well documented  <cit> .

the overlap of strain sensitivities to different drugs is represented in figure 1c. a total of  <dig> gene deletion mutants were identified with increased sensitivity to a minimum of one drug ;  <dig> were sensitive to two or more drugs. a mutant for the vacuole gene ydr495cΔ  was sensitive to the five treatments. this mutant has been observed in other screens, suggesting non-specific involvement in multiple drug resistance. when analyzing the overlapping drug sensitive strains, the ratio of protein synthesis related genes did not increase significantly when sensitivities to two or more drugs were analyzed . enrichment in the category of transport and stress related genes, into which multiple drug resistant genes generally fall, was observed for some multiple drug sensitive groups. this highlights that selection based on several drugs could partially target multiple drug resistant genes.

to investigate the accuracy of our large-scale approach to detect drug sensitive mutants, five deletion strains were selected and subjected to spot test analysis . this analysis confirmed that deletion of ypl009c confers increased sensitivity to cycloheximide, deletion of ydr056c increases sensitivity to streptomycin and neomycin, deletion of yjr111c increases sensitivity to streptomycin, and deletions of yil137c and ypl183w-a increase sensitivity to 3-at. these results are in agreement with the large-scale analysis and confirm that this approach can identify strains that are sensitive to the drugs used in this study.

synthetic genetic array  analysis for tae <dig>  tae <dig> and tae4
the majority of mutants with increased sensitivity to the target drugs had deletions of genes with known functions in protein biosynthesis. therefore, the activities of three mutants for genes that are not well characterized, ypl009c, yil137c and ypl183w-a, were examined by studying genetic interactions with previously reported protein biosynthesis related genes. these genes have not been characterized but available literature and our unpublished data suggest possible associations with certain disease related-genes and phenotypes .

it is generally accepted that many genes/pathways in eukaryotic cells are functionally redundant and that compensation for loss of activity is prevalent  <cit> . however, deletion of a second functionally related gene/pathway could result in sickness or lethality, indicating an aggravating interaction. consequently, the sickness of double mutants can be used to investigate genetic interaction and functional relationships between genes   <cit> . the synthetic genetic interactions of ypl009c, yil137c and ypl183w-a with other protein biosynthesis genes were investigated by systematically examining double gene deletions for alterations in colony size  <cit> . if our targeted genes are involved in protein biosynthesis, it would be expected on the basis of their molecular function that they would interact genetically with other translation genes with related functions. as presented in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  ypl009c, yil137c and ypl183w-a interacted genetically with a number of translation genes as evidenced by the sick phenotype of the double mutants. these results suggest a functional association for our target genes with the process of protein biosynthesis. therefore, the studied genes were named tae <dig> , tae <dig>  and tae <dig> , or translation associated elements 2- <dig>  respectively. the largest group of genes that interacted with tae <dig> and tae <dig> were those involved in translation associated rna processing, with three and seven interactions, respectively. this group included genes such rna exonuclease ylr059c , which is involved in rrna maturation and processing, rrna binding protein yhr066wp , which is a constituent of the  <dig> s pre-ribosomal subunit, and nuclear pore complex protein ykl068wp , which is involved in mrna and rrna export and ribosomal protein import to the nucleus. tae <dig> interacted with five genes related to different small ribosomal subunit proteins including ylr441c, which codes for s1a, and yjl190c, which codes for s22a. tae <dig> had a general pattern of interaction and interacted with genes with differing functions. the largest groups of genes  that interacted with tae <dig> had five members each, with functions in amino acid biosynthesis, small ribosomal subunit proteins and regulation of translation.

in addition, some of the identified genetic partners were shared between the query genes . for example, ydr025w, which codes for the small ribosomal subunit protein s11a, interacted genetically with tae <dig> and tae <dig>  and yfr009w , which is involved in positive activation of gcn <dig> kinase, interacted with tae <dig> and tae <dig>  furthermore, a synthetic genetic interaction between tae <dig> and tae <dig> was observed.

in contrast to the aggravating interactions in which sickness of double mutants was investigated, interactions concerning double mutants with higher fitness than expected were examined. such alleviating interactions, also known as synthetic rescue, are thought to exist between genes in the same pathway  <cit> . six such interactions were identified in this study . in agreement with the synthetic sickness interactions, which showed that the largest functional interaction partners for tae <dig> and tae <dig> were involved in translation associated rna processing, it was observed that tae <dig> interacted with the rna processing gene ylr107w  and with ykl068w , a gene involved in rna transport from the nucleus and associated with rrna and trna export, and that tae <dig> interacted with another rna processing gene, ynl001w . tae <dig> had alleviating interactions with three genes with different functions, namely ykr059w , which has a role in translation initiation, ydr494w , which is involved in mitochondrial translation, and ydr450w , associated with the structure of small ribosomal subunits. the diversity of the interactions in which tae <dig> is involved mirrors the results of the synthetic sick interactions, leading to the conclusion that it did not interact with one major functional group.

a recent genome-wide synthetic genetic interaction study used tae <dig> and tae <dig> as query genes and demonstrated that they formed synthetic sick and lethal interactions predominantly with genes involved in protein biosynthesis   <cit> , confirming the results presented herein. similarly, the synthetic sick and lethal interactions reported for tae <dig> predominantly  concerned protein biosynthesis genes.

functional correlations for tae <dig> and tae <dig> with other protein synthesis related genes
overexpression of a gene often compensates for a phenotypic consequence caused by the absence of a functionally related gene  <cit> . therefore, one approach to studying protein function would be to investigate whether its overexpression can compensate for the absence of proteins with known functions. this approach was used to investigate further the biological activity of the gene products for tae <dig> and tae <dig> by investigating whether their overexpression could reverse the phenotypic consequences caused by the absence of other translation genes . for an unknown reason our multiple attempts to isolate an overexpression plasmid for tae <dig> from the yeast gene overexpression library were unsuccessful. consequently, tae <dig> was omitted from this part of the investigation. reduced growth was used as the target phenotypic consequence for gene deletion strains cultured in the presence of neomycin and streptomycin. as indicated in figure  <dig> , we observed that the growth defects in the presence of neomycin and/or streptomycin for a number of deletion strains for translation genes were compensated by the overexpression of tae <dig>  or tae <dig> . in agreement with the synthetic genetic interactions described previously, the two main functional categories that tae <dig> overexpression rescued included genes involved in translation related rna processing and  <dig> s ribosomal structure maintenance. for example, tae <dig> overexpression rescued the sensitivity to drugs of deletion strains for the pre rrna processing gene ygr159c  and the  <dig> s ribosomal subunit protein s <dig> gene ygr118w . these observations can be explained by a role for tae <dig> in  <dig> s biogenesis, which is in agreement with the synthetic sick and synthetic rescue interactions observed for tae <dig> 

as was the case with the synthetic genetic interactions for tae <dig>  the phenotypic suppression analysis suggested a general role for tae <dig> in translation. overexpression of tae <dig> compensated for the deletion of a number of genes with diverse roles in translation such as ymr242c , which codes for a  <dig> s ribosomal subunit protein, ydr462w , which codes for a mitochondrial ribosome protein, and ykr059w , which codes for the translation initiation factor eif4a.

three of the rescued gene deletion strains, ydl083cΔ , ypl081wΔ  and yil052cΔ , were shared between tae <dig> and tae <dig>  this is in accordance with the synthetic genetic interaction observed between these two genes . such interactions highlight the interconnectivity of a genetic interaction map for translation genes.

deletions of tae <dig>  tae <dig> and tae <dig> affect the process of protein synthesis
the genetic interaction analyses provide a direct link between tae <dig>  tae <dig> and tae <dig>  and the process of protein biosynthesis. to investigate this link further we examined the effect of deletion of the target genes on translation efficiency, stop codon readthrough and ribosome biogenesis. if any differences were detected we would expect them to be subtle owing to the importance of protein biosynthesis for cell survival and the fact that the deletion of the target genes does not change the growth rate of the mutants under standard laboratory conditions.

we first investigated the involvement of tae <dig>  tae <dig> and tae <dig> in translation efficiency. deletion mutants tae2Δ, tae3Δ and tae4Δ were subjected to  methionine incorporation analysis. tae2Δ, tae3Δ and tae4Δ mutant strains demonstrated approximately 30%, 14% and 10% reduced levels of  methionine incorporation, respectively . to complement these findings, we investigated the rate of protein synthesis using an inducible β-galactosidase reporter construct  under the control of a gal <dig> promoter  <cit> , which better highlights differences in translation efficiencies  <cit> . after four hours of induction, levels of β-galactosidase activity were six fold lower for tae2Δ and tae3Δ mutants, and five fold lower for tae4Δ  while their mrna contents remained relatively unchanged .

a plasmid-based β-galactosidase system with different premature termination codons was used to study stop codon readthrough. in this approach alterations in translation fidelity lead to an increase in termination codon readthrough and thus elevate the production of full length functional β-galactosidase. to this end, target deletion strains were transformed with three different plasmids, pukc <dig>  pukc817and pukc <dig>  <cit> , and the expression of β-galactosidase in each mutant was quantified. pukc <dig> contains no in-frame premature termination codon and was used as a control. pukc <dig> and pukc <dig> contain in-frame termination codons uaa and uag, respectively. apparent from the increased relative productions of β-galactosidase shown in figure 5c, deletion of tae <dig>  tae <dig> and tae <dig> resulted in higher levels of termination codon readthrough. comparable levels of β-galactosidase mrna were evident in each of the tested strains  demonstrating that the observed increase s in β-galactosidase activity were not due to altered levels of mrna.

a surprising observation was that deletion of tae <dig> resulted in a higher readthrough for the uaa  stop codon but not uag . generally, it is expected that alterations in translation fidelity result in more readthrough for a less stringent stop codon, in this case uag. this was observed for tae2Δ and tae3Δ but not tae4Δ. a possible explanation is that deletion of tae <dig> causes an alteration that is stop codon specific. for example, it could reduce the affinity of ribosomes for a specific translation release factor  but not others.

next, the ribosome profiles for tae2Δ, tae3Δ and tae4Δ gene deletion strains were investigated. the profiles had three peaks associated with free  <dig> s and  <dig> s subunits and  <dig> s monosomes, followed by a series of peaks representing polysomes . the ribosome profile for tae2Δ was comparable to the wild type strain . however, for tae3Δ, a reduction in polysomes was observed, as was an increase in free  <dig> s subunit . the free 60s: <dig> s subunit ratio for this mutant was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in comparison to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for the wild type. similarly, the profile for tae4Δ demonstrated a significant increase in free  <dig> s subunits, a slight increase in  <dig> s monosomes and a slight reduction in larger polysomes . the free 60s: <dig> s subunit ratio for tae4Δ was  <dig>  ±  <dig> . reduction of polysomes could explain the observed reductions in the efficiency of protein synthesis for tae3Δ and tae4Δ. alterations in the pool of free ribosomal subunits could relate to deficits in subunit biogenesis, suggesting that tae <dig> and tae <dig> could be involved in the process of ribosome biogenesis. the  <dig> s and  <dig> s subunits are in equilibrium with  <dig> s monosomes, therefore an increase in  <dig> s free subunits could relate to a defect in  <dig> s biogenesis  <cit>  as observed for tae3Δ and tae4Δ mutants. a more precise calculation for measuring free 60s: <dig> s involves measuring  <dig> s and  <dig> s subunits separated on a sucrose gradient with low concentrations of mg2+, but this was not carried out in the present study.

discussion
gene deletions that cause increased sensitivity to a bioactive compound can be used to identify pathways that buffer the cell against the activity of that compound  <cit> . therefore, chemical-genetic profiles of inhibitory compounds can lead to identification of their overall mode of action and any side effects associated with toxicity of the drug. furthermore, these profiles can help identify novel genes involved in specific cellular pathways targeted by compounds  <cit> . in this study the sensitivity of a yeast gene deletion array to five different bioactive compounds was investigated using colony size reduction as the endpoint. the overall profiles of these compounds were comparable, with the deletion of genes involved in protein biosynthesis being the dominant cluster. further investigations concerned three sensitive deletion strains for genes that are not well characterized, that here we term tae <dig>  tae <dig> and tae <dig>  genetic analyses provided evidence for involvement of these genes in protein biosynthesis.

there is limited information relating to the molecular activity of tae4p. in a large-scale investigation it was reported that deletion of tae <dig> rescued the temperature sensitivity of cdc13- <dig>  so it was thought to be a restrictor of telomere capping; cdc13p is an essential protein involved in checkpoint and telomere capping. the c-terminal domain of tae4p, amino acids 56- <dig>  has sequence homology to the prokaryotic ribosomal protein l <dig>  in the current study it was observed that tae <dig> formed synthetic sick interactions with two predominant categories of genes with functions in rna processing associated with protein biosynthesis and genes that code for  <dig> s ribosomal subunit associated proteins. furthermore, it formed phenotypic suppression interactions with the same two categories of genes, linking the activity of tae <dig> to rna processing and the  <dig> s subunit. tae <dig> involvement in  <dig> s biogenesis was confirmed by ribosome profile analysis and explains the observed effects of the deletion of tae <dig> on stop codon readthrough and the efficiency of translation. furthermore, tae <dig> is co-regulated with several rrna processing proteins such as the lsm protein yjr022wp  implicated in pre-rrna and pre-trna processing  <cit>  and a preribosome processing protein ylr409cp  involved in  <dig> s rrna processing  <cit> . these observations, together with the results presented here, provide strong evidence that the activity of tae <dig> is related to rna processing and ribosome biogenesis. the c-terminal domain of tae4p contains two rna binding domains. therefore, tae4p can affect rrna processing by directly binding to rrna or by recruiting other factors to rrna, which in turn can affect ribosome biogenesis.

tae <dig>  has no previously reported cellular function but its protein product shares a domain similar to the human colon cancer antigen  <dig>  and has some sequence homology with a putative rna binding protein in drosophila melanogaster. the synthetic sick and synthetic rescue genetic interaction analyses presented herein indicated a diverse interaction pattern for tae <dig> with various translation genes. tae <dig> overexpression rescued the phenotype of deletion strains for genes with different functions in various steps of translation, suggesting a general involvement of tae <dig> in protein biosynthesis that is not targeted to a specific pathway. deletion of tae <dig> caused an increase in stop codon readthrough and a decrease in translation efficiency. one possible explanation for these results is that tae <dig> could transiently aid in mediating the overall activity of ribosomes and hence translation efficiency and fidelity. translation in vivo is more efficient than in reconstituted in vitro experiments, indicating the presence of uncharacterized translation elements in vivo  <cit> . the activity of tae <dig> is supported by the observation that in large-scale affinity purification experiments tae2p co-purified with several ribosomal subunit proteins  <cit> . however, low concentrations of salt destabilize this interaction  <cit>  suggesting that tae2p transiently interacts with ribosomes. in addition, tae2p was recently computationally predicted to interact directly with the ribosomal subunit protein ydr418wp   <cit> .

tae <dig> predominantly formed synthetic sick interactions with rna processing genes involved in translation and formed synthetic rescue interactions with genes with similar rna processing functions. alterations in the ribosomal profile of the tae3Δ strain suggest a deficiency in  <dig> s subunit biogenesis, and a role for tae <dig> in rna processing associated with  <dig> s biogenesis could explain these observations. in addition, this would explain the observation that deletion of tae <dig> caused an increased stop codon readthrough and a reduction in the efficiency of protein synthesis. in agreement with this role for tae <dig>  the expression of tae <dig> is reported to be strongly co-regulated with essential translation genes including yal003w , which codes for a subunit of rnase mrp involved in pre-rrna cleavage, and ybl004w , which is involved in  <dig> s rrna processing  <cit> . tae3p does not appear to contain an rna binding domain. therefore, it is possible that tae3p may interact with an intermediate rna binding protein in order to exert its activity. in agreement with this, tae3p was reported to co-purify with yor272wp , a constituent of the  <dig> s pre-ribosomal particle  <cit> . in addition, we previously observed that deletion of tae <dig> reduced the efficiency of double stranded dna break repair, which could be an independent activity for tae <dig> .

the effect of tae <dig> deletion on stop codon readthrough is in agreement with a previous study  <cit> . however, the same investigation detected no apparent alteration in translation efficiency. a possible explanation for this difference is that the latter study utilized diploid homozygous gene deletion cells whereas the current study used haploid cells and the efficiency of induced translation was not measured in the former. differences between the experimental observations in the haploid and diploid systems have been reported  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the overall chemical-genetic profiles of the investigated compounds were comparable, with genes associated with protein biosynthesis being the dominant cluster, followed in a broad descending order by those involved in metabolism, cellular compartments and biogenesis, transport and stress, dna repair and replication, and others. this observation may further underline previously speculated links between protein biosynthesis and other fundamental cellular processes. the smaller clusters could also represent alternative modes of activities for these compounds. genetic investigations of three profiled genes further highlighted the effectiveness of chemical-genetic profiling for the investigation of gene functions for translation genes.
