BACKGROUND
deafness is a widespread problem with tremendous societal costs, but effective treatments for hearing loss have remained elusive. therapeutics that can successfully treat or prevent the onset of deafness are desperately needed. to develop such treatments, a thorough understanding of the process of auditory hair cell death and regeneration must be established. mammalian cochlear hair cells do not regenerate after they have been destroyed, and vestibular hair cells show limited capacity to regenerate  <cit> . however, avian and teleost sensory hair cells regenerate  <cit>  through direct trans-differentiation  <cit>  or mitosis  <cit> . the genes responsible for conferring teleost regenerative capacity are unknown; however, most of the zebrafish genome has been sequenced and resources are available for the identification of gene function  <cit> . the mechanosensory hair cell of teleosts resembles that of the human hair cell at both the structural and functional level  <cit> , and there is a high degree of evolutionary conservation of chromosomal synteny extending from zebrafish to human  <cit> . mammals share homologous genes with fish that are known to affect inner ear structure and/or function. for instance, the zebrafish mariner mutant possesses a missense mutation in the gene encoding myosin viia and presents functional and morphological hair cell defects that are similar to those found in mice defective in myosin viia  <cit> . foxi <dig>  a gene expressed in otic precursor cells, is necessary for normal inner ear development in both mice  <cit>  and zebrafish  <cit> . atoh <dig>  is required for differentiation of hair cells in rodents  <cit>  while a similar role is carried out by zebrafish homologs atoh1a and atoh1b  <cit> . since zebrafish share inner ear developmental and differentiation genes with mammals, examination of gene expression in the zebrafish during hair cell regeneration may uncover new targets for genetic manipulation leading to hair cell regeneration in mammals.

investigators have induced auditory hair cells to proliferate in postnatal mammals using gene therapies that disrupt the normal pathways that keep mammalian cochlear hair cells and their surrounding supporting cells in a terminally differentiated state. the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip <dig> , the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein , and transcription factor atoh <dig> have been investigated as potential therapeutic targets  <cit> . to date, gene manipulation studies have proven unsuccessful in producing auditory hair cells of the proper quantity and arrangement  <cit> , maturity and function  <cit> , or location  <cit> . adjusting the timing and/or sequence of manipulation of the above-mentioned targets may produce more satisfactory results; however, other targets that have not yet been identified may prove to be key regulators of auditory hair cell regeneration.

we have recently established a basic time line of sound-induced cell proliferation and hair cell bundle recovery in the zebrafish saccule following acoustically-induced damage  <cit> . by performing zebrafish-based transcriptomic analysis following acoustic overexposure, the purpose of the current study was to identify genes that are important in the recovery and regeneration of teleost, and perhaps mammalian, hair cells. such gene pathway analyses may help identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention. in this study, we report on the role of growth hormone-mediated signaling in hair cell proliferation and present a number of other genes differentially regulated following acoustic overstimulation, including those for major histocompatibility proteins and myosins.

RESULTS
comparative transcriptome analysis of time points following acoustic overexposure
we were interested in the changes in gene regulation that occurred on and between  <dig> and  <dig> days post-sound exposure  to a  <dig> hz tone at  <dig> db re  <dig> μpa root mean squared  for  <dig> h, as previous work indicated that this level of sound exposure produced significant hair cell damage in the zebrafish saccule. in this previous study, hair cell damage was followed by significant cell proliferation that peaked at  <dig> dpse and fell to control levels before  <dig> dpse. additionally, hair cell bundle density on the saccular macula decreased immediately following acoustic exposure and then increased between  <dig> and  <dig> dpse, indicating that hair cell replacement and/or repair took place during this time interval  <cit> . we hoped to detect differential expression of genes involved in zebrafish auditory hair cell replacement and/or repair during this time period.

rna samples extracted from whole inner ears from adult zebrafish were collected at  <dig> and  <dig> dpse  and were subjected to microarray analysis. pairwise comparisons were made between groups such that three gene sets were analyzed: day  <dig> , day  <dig> , and day 4: day  <dig> . differentially expressed genes with fold changes ≥ <dig>  and p-values ≤  <dig>  were considered to be significantly regulated. a number of significantly regulated transcripts were detected by each pairwise comparison. there were  <dig> transcripts that were differentially expressed two days following acoustic trauma,  <dig> transcripts on day  <dig>  and  <dig> transcripts on day 4: day  <dig> . to assess the reproducibility within control, day  <dig>  and day  <dig> microarray data, we compared gene expression between triplicate homotypic samples. the mean unnormalized correlation coefficients for all three of these datasets was  <dig> , indicating robust consistency between technical replicates. tables  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> show the top ten most highly up-regulated and top ten most highly down-regulated genes for each of the following pairwise comparisons- day 2:controls, day 4:controls, and day 4:day  <dig>  respectively. additional files  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> list the subpopulations of all genes whose expression was significantly regulated , sorted by fold change.

transcripts showing the greatest regulation on day  <dig> compared to control included growth hormone  <dig> , major histocompatibility complex, class i, ze , atrial myosin light chain , and slow muscle myosin heavy chain, like . on day  <dig>  the transcripts showing the greatest fold change included atrial myosin light chain  and slow myosin heavy chain  <dig>  like . transcripts showing the greatest fold change in the day 4: day  <dig> dataset included major histocompatibility complex class i ze  and gh <dig> . many of the genes that were significantly regulated on day  <dig>  were significantly regulated in the opposite direction on day  <dig> . for example, growth hormone  <dig> , matrix metalloproteinase  <dig> , major histocompatibility complex  class ii integral membrane protein alpha chain  <dig> , and junb were upregulated at day  <dig>  but downregulated at day  <dig> compared to day  <dig>  in contrast, mhc class i, ze  and mhc class ii integral membrane alpha chain  were downregulated at day  <dig>  but upregulated at day  <dig> compared to day  <dig> 

we used in silico tools  to identify pathways that may be associated with proliferation and hair cell recovery. functional analysis of the three sets of transcripts was used to identify significant processes or pathways being affected during the process of auditory cell regeneration in the zebrafish ear. while numerous pathways were significantly regulated, we present only the top  <dig> categories here . cancer and cellular growth and proliferation pathways were the most significant functional categories at both  <dig> and  <dig> dpse. this is not surprising since previous work showed that cell proliferation peaks at two days following acoustic trauma in the zebrafish ear  <cit> . additional files  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> present the categories and functions of all the genes analyzed for the day 2:control, day 4:control, and day 2:day  <dig> datasets, respectively.

cell death pathways were significantly regulated at day  <dig> compared to controls. other processes that were significantly regulated during the first four days following acoustic trauma included cellular development, inflammation, immunology, and dermatological diseases and conditions .

following this initial analysis, we sought to identify gene networks and biochemical pathways of zebrafish homologs of mammalian genes that may be significantly up- or down-regulated in response to acoustic overexposure. since cancer and cellular proliferation pathways were highly regulated in our dataset, we used functional network analysis to identify specific pathways involved in cellular growth. at day  <dig>  gh <dig> was the most highly overexpressed gene, but others included junb, fos, cga, socs <dig> and  <dig>  cdk <dig>  and mmp <dig> . by day  <dig>  most of these genes were significantly under-expressed .

zebrafish homologs of mammalian genes reportedly involved in growth hormone pathways were shown to be significantly regulated in the zebrafish microarray dataset . the jak-stat signaling pathway regulates the production of insulin-like growth factors . at day  <dig>  transcripts for socs , shp <dig> , and cebpa , a regulator of transcription, were upregulated. both socs and shp <dig> are inhibitors of jak, and cebpa can interact with cyclin-dependent kinases to arrest cell growth  <cit>  so their over-expression could be part of a negative feedback loop associated with a strong gh signal. in contrast, c-fos  is also upregulated, and is a proto-oncogene that promotes cell growth and proliferation  <cit> .

confirmation of microarray results with real-time quantitative pcr
in order to validate the results obtained through microarray analysis, we performed real-time quantitative pcr using probes obtained from custom taqman gene expression assays  designed against the following target genes: ef1alpha, gh <dig>  junb, atoh1a, rb <dig>  and cdkn1b. sybr green probes were designed against the following genes: smyhc1l , zgc: <dig> , mlc <dig>  mhc1ze, and ppia. the pattern of transcript abundance detected for these genes in the array was validated with the aid of real-time pcr . the target genes that were chosen included genes that were up-regulated , down-regulated , and not highly regulated . in addition, atoh1a and cdkn1b were chosen since they are known to regulate cell proliferation and hair cell regeneration in the mammalian ear  <cit> .

effect of growth hormone on cell proliferation in the zebrafish utricle and saccule
we were interested in the effect that overexposure to gh might have in the normal, non-acoustically exposed inner ear, given that gh <dig> levels were so dramatically up-regulated following acoustic trauma. zebrafish  were intraperitoneally injected with salmon gh and allowed to recover  <dig> h before treatment for bromodeoxyuridine  detection through immunofluorescence. two inner ear end organs were examined: the utricle, which is part of the vestibular system, and the saccule, which is the organ most fully characterized as a sound detector in fishes  <cit> . injection with growth hormone resulted in a significant increase in cell proliferation only in the utricle , although a deductable increase was also noted in the rostral portion of the saccule .

a small number of proliferating cells was detected in control saccules , which supports previous reports of ongoing proliferation in the adult zebrafish saccule  <cit> . proliferating cells in control saccules were noted primarily near the rostral tip and near the outer margins, although some brdu-labeled cells were observed in other portions of the saccule . proliferating cells observed in treatment saccules did not show a consistent spatial arrangement in the rostral area. in some saccules, proliferating cells were located primarily near the edges of the rostral area, while in other saccules labeled cells were concentrated in the center of the rostral saccule. the spatial distribution of proliferating cells in the caudal region of the saccule was similar in control and treatment groups. labeled cells occurred mainly in the outer margins of the macula.

proliferating cells were also observed in control utricles, primarily near the outer margins of the macula . labeled cells in treatment utricles were scattered widely across the entire surface of the utricular macula, with less observable clustering or concentration at the edges than in controls. proliferating cells in both control and treatment saccules and utricles were observed in multiple cell layers of the sensory epithelia.

discussion
our current approach has been to delineate regulated zebrafish genes in order to provide direction for future investigations into auditory hair cell regeneration in zebrafish and mammals. distinct patterns of gene expression were evident two and four days after acoustic trauma, suggesting that sound-induced damage in the zebrafish inner ear is a good model system for understanding pathways involved in hair cell regeneration. transcripts showing the most dramatic regulation over the time course of our study include transcripts encoding growth hormone, major histocompatibility complex, class i, ze, a light chain myosin, a heavy chain myosin, and a protein similar to atrial myosin light chain .

the short time period within which these transcripts were examined following acoustic trauma coincided with a sharp increase in cell proliferation and partial recovery of hair cell bundle density, which was observed in our previous experiment with zebrafish  <cit> , suggesting that these genes, as well as others listed in the datasets, may play a role in the regulation of cell proliferation and/or cellular repair. genes associated with transport, kinase activity, transcription factor activity, signal transduction, hormone activity, nucleobase, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolic process, extracellular region, cellular component, and calcium ion binding were also significantly regulated during this time period. however, a number of genes could not currently be assigned to any process or functional category. the roles of these transcripts during hair cell repair and regeneration remain undetermined. further work is needed to elucidate the specific roles of many of the genes uncovered in this study.

a. role of growth hormone in hair cell regeneration
mammalian growth hormone  and insulin-like growth factor  <dig>  affect growth in postnatal animals through independent and common pathways  <cit> , influencing final stature  <cit>  and facilitating neuron development and survival  <cit> . no previous study has been published concerning the effect of growth hormone in the inner ear, but other growth-related factors are known to affect hair cell production and survival in mammals. igf1-null mice exhibit altered inner ear maturation, abnormal innervation of the sensory cells in the organ of corti, and increased apoptosis of cochlear neurons  <cit> . vestibular hair cell proliferation can be stimulated in mammals through exposure to transforming growth factor-alpha and epidermal growth factor  <cit> . the zebrafish homologs of these genes were not listed among the differentially regulated transcripts in our study, but gh <dig> was dramatically upregulated 64-fold on day  <dig> and remained upregulated over five-fold on day  <dig>  indicating that growth hormone played a prominent role in post-sound exposure recovery of the inner ear of zebrafish. we speculated that the activity of gh <dig> in the zebrafish might induce proliferation in the ear, since administration of growth hormone can increase cell proliferation in cultured trout leukocytes  <cit>  and increase body mass in zebrafish  <cit> . to characterize the effect of gh <dig> on cells of the inner ear, we injected zebrafish with salmon growth hormone. the significant increase we observed in cell proliferation in non-sound-exposed zebrafish inner ear following injection with growth hormone suggests at least three things: 1) growth hormone has the ability to stimulate proliferation in the inner ear of zebrafish, 2) under normal conditions, cells of the utricle, a vestibular organ, are more sensitive to growth hormone-mediated signaling than are cells of the saccule, and 3) that the rostral portion of the saccule may be more sensitive than the caudal portion. the difference in growth hormone sensitivity between the zebrafish utricle and saccule, and the potential difference between the rostral and caudal portions of the saccule, was unexpected but intriguing.

a difference in growth hormone sensitivity may reflect differences in proliferative capacity among the inner ear end organs. the regenerative capacity of hair cells in the fish utricle and lagena has not yet been determined. however, other non-mammalian vertebrates are capable of regenerating hair cells in both the vestibular and auditory portions of the inner ear  <cit> , and rates of proliferation differ in vestibular and auditory systems in the absence of damage. for instance, supporting cells in the auditory portion of the chick inner ear, the basilar papilla, are normally quiescent in the absence of a damaging stimulus  <cit> . conversely, hair cells in the vestibular organs of chicks have a relatively short life span , undergoing spontaneous apoptosis and replacement though proliferation and differentiation of epithelial supporting cells  <cit> . hair cells in the mammalian auditory system do not regenerate, but vestibular hair cells exhibit a limited regenerative capacity  <cit> . low levels of apoptosis occur throughout the development of the zebrafish saccule  <cit> , but no data comparing the rate of apoptosis in the uninjured zebrafish saccule and utricle is currently available. this would be useful in elucidating whether the dissimilar sensitivity of different portions of the zebrafish inner ear to proliferation corresponds with dissimilar rates of apoptosis. in noise-exposed goldfish, apoptosis peaked in the saccule one day before a peak in apoptosis in the lagena, suggesting that patterns of cell damage can vary between different endorgans of the teleost ear  <cit> .

interestingly, although gh <dig> was up regulated approximately 64-fold at  <dig> dpse in our experiment with zebrafish, gh <dig> in the rat cochlea is down-regulated two-fold following temporary threshold shift induced by noise-exposure, and to a smaller extent following permanent threshold shift  <cit> . previous studies with mammals have shown that acute or chronic stresses can reduce gh levels in blood serum as well as in the brain  <cit> . while it is possible that exposure to sound produces a different growth hormone regulatory response in mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates like zebrafish, it is more likely that this is due to differential timing of sound exposure. in the rat cochlea experiment, noise exposures were only for  <dig> minutes whereas in the current study, zebrafish were exposed for  <dig> hours followed by a two day recovery period. thus, in zebrafish there could have been a decrease in gh during the initial stress of the acoustic exposure, followed by a subsequent increase during the recovery and regeneration phase. future experiments with more time points following acoustic trauma are needed to determine this.

b. other transcripts associated with cell proliferation
other genes that may have been up- or down- regulated in order to enable cell proliferation include signal transducer and activator of transcription  <dig> , stearoyl-coa desaturase , diacylglycerol o-acyltransferase , and major histocompatablility complex class ii  genes. the function of stat <dig> may be connected with gh <dig>  as it is in mammals, since growth hormone is known to activate signaling pathways that include stat proteins . the stat activation process is transient and influences a broad range of physiological processes depending on the activating ligands and tissue type  <cit> . the stats that are activated by growth hormone exposure can vary by cell type, possibly contributing to the specificity of the growth hormone response  <cit> .

proteins scd and dgat appear to regulate lipid biosynthesis, and possibly phospholipid membrane synthesis. proliferation depends in part on the ability to incorporate oleate with free long-chain fatty acids in order to form membrane phospholipids  <cit> . since the scd protein synthesizes the oleate necessary for the biosynthesis of membrane phospholipids  <cit> , the danio rerio scd gene may be up-regulated on day two in order to increase production of membrane phospholipids as required by cell proliferation. the protein encoded by dgat, another gene up-regulated at  <dig> dpse and down-regulated between days  <dig> and  <dig>  also participates in the regulation of membrane lipid synthesis. dgat proteins interact with diacylglycerols, which are common intermediates for both triacylglycerol and phospholipid synthesis. dgat tips diacylglycerol toward triacylglycerol synthesis. for instance, in vitro overexpression of dgat <dig> gene in human lung sv40-transformed fibroblasts reduces synthesis of the membrane phospholipids phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin by 30-40%, and reduces cell growth rate  <cit> . it is not clear why dgat was upregulated on day  <dig>  given that cell proliferation peaks at this time, but one possibility is that up-regulation of dgat occurred as part of the system to regulate proliferation.

several genes associated with immune function were identified in the microarray. these genes may play roles in cell proliferation following apoptosis. major histocompatibility  class ii molecules are found on professional antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells and b cells. mhc class ii molecules are observed in the cochlear cells of adult mice following a damaging event and may promote cell proliferation in the inner ear of organs that possess proliferative capability  <cit> .

deoxyspergualin, a drug that inhibits de novo cell surface expression of mhc class ii antigens, blocks cell proliferation in the kidney  <cit> . zebrafish mhc complex class ii integral membrane alpha chain gene  was significantly regulated on  <dig> dpse and between days  <dig> and  <dig> dpse. even more notable is mhc complex, class i, ze , which was down-regulated more than 67-fold on  <dig> dpse, but was not significantly regulated by  <dig> dpse. at this time, the function of mhc1ze has not been determined, but since mhc class i proteins are involved in antigen presentation on nearly all cell types in mammals, it seems probable that mhc1ze functions similarly in zebrafish. antibodies that bind human mhc class i molecules  and prevent them from presenting antigens induce increased proliferation of airway epithelial cells  <cit> . down-regulating mhc1ze in zebrafish may have a similar effect, encouraging proliferation by the reduction of antigen presentation.

it is not surprising that genes related to immune function were regulated following acoustic trauma since macrophages, a type of leukocyte, are recruited to sites of damage and may be involved in initiating wound healing and repair  <cit> . within hours of trauma to hair cell sensory epithelium, macrophages and other leukocytes are recruited to the area of damage. this has been reported in the lateral line of amphibians  <cit>  and zebrafish  <cit> , avian inner ear sensory epithelia  <cit> , and the mammalian organ of corti  <cit> . macrophages recognize and destroy cells undergoing apoptosis via phagocytosis  <cit>  and may secrete substances such as growth factors that could affect cell proliferation and other functions  <cit> . it has long been recognized that there is an interaction between the endocrine and immune systems in mammals. this appears to be true in fishes as well, and gh may be an important mediator between the two systems. for example, plasma gh levels and phagocytic activity are positively correlated in brown trout  during sea-water transfer  <cit> , and gh causes proliferation in leukocyte cultures of chum salmon, onchorynchus keta  <cit> . reciprocal effects are also evident. stress induces a rapid decrease of plasma gh levels in several fish species  <cit> .

another group of proteins that were highly regulated in our dataset were myosins. the most highly regulated were atrial myosin light chain  and slow muscle myosin heavy chain, like . mutations in non-muscle myosins myh <dig>  myh <dig> and myosin viia have been implicated in deafness in mammals  <cit> . myosins are a large superfamily with many shared domains among the members and are important regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, a prominent component of hair cell bundles. a large number of different myosins are expressed in developing neurons and sensory cells, helping to carry out a range of functions including morphogenesis, axonal transport, and synaptic and sensory functions , although the functions of many myosins are not known  <cit> .

it is not clear why smyhc1l was down-regulated following acoustic trauma; however, smyhc1l may play a role in the regulation of immune response in the inner ear. smyhc1l is a tmpit-like protein, which is induced by tnf-alpha  <cit> . since tnf-alpha is a cytokine involved in inducing immune response, apoptosis and inflammation  <cit> , it is reasonable to assume that the down-regulation that we see in smyhc1l may be associated with the down-regulation in tnf-alpha and other cytokines that one would expect during the recovery from inflammation. in support of this, a number of genes that are negative regulators of immune response were up-regulated two days post-trauma, including tcf family b cell activation factor , c1q tnf <dig> protein , and complement c1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein  <dig> precursor .

atrial myosin light chain  possesses an ef-hand domain  <cit> . ef hands are a superfamily of calcium sensors and calcium signal modulators. calcium-binding proteins such as calretinin, calmodulin, and parvalbumin have been used as markers for inner ear ganglion neurons and hair cells  <cit> . calmodulin is known to mediate inflammation, apoptosis, immune response, and cell cycling  <cit> , but it is unclear at this point if the calcium-binding properties of atrial myosin light chain are serving similar roles in the zebrafish inner ear.

c. genes associated with induced hair cell regeneration in mammals
zebrafish homologs of genes that have been used to induce hair cell regeneration in mammals, specifically, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27/cdkn1b, retinoblastoma <dig> , and atonal homolog  <dig>  were found to be regulated at the p-value  <dig>  level, but not at fold changes ≥ <dig> . two days following sound exposure, cdkn1b was down-regulated slightly , while cdkn1b and rb <dig>  both suppressors of cellular proliferation, showed up-regulation  at  <dig> dpse following the peak in proliferation . a similar pattern was evident for atoh <dig>  which was down-regulated at  <dig> dpse  and up-regulated at  <dig> dpse . thus, more work will need to be done to rule them out as players in the process of proliferation and differentiation of zebrafish hair cells.

in this study, we used rna isolated from whole ear tissue because of the very small size of the sensory epithelium of the zebrafish inner ear. rna collected only from sensory maculae or specific cell types may reveal significant regulation of low-abundance transcripts that was not detectable in whole ear samples. additionally, regulation of proteins, which would not be detected via microarray, likely affects cellular processes during regeneration in the inner ear. levels of existing p27kip <dig> protein may have been altered by ubiquitinylation in order to allow proliferation to occur. analysis of p27kip <dig> protein alteration in the sound-exposed inner ear will be necessary to ascertain whether p27kip <dig> protein regulation plays a significant role in naturally occurring hair cell regeneration in the zebrafish. interestingly, p <dig> kip <dig> was not found to be a part of the zebrafish hair cell transcriptome  <cit> , although it is a supporting cell marker in the mammalian organ of corti that inhibits cell cycle progression  <cit> . knock-out mice without this gene exhibit cell proliferation in the organ of corti  <cit> .

the gene rb <dig>  was also not significantly regulated in this study at the  <dig>  fold cut-off level, but since rb <dig> function is regulated by phosphorylation, significant changes in overall transcription levels may not be necessary to promote proliferation. hypophosphorylated rb <dig> is an active proliferation repressor, but rb <dig> loses all repression function if sufficiently phosphorylated  <cit> . the phosphorylation state of prb following noise exposure will need to be delineated to determine whether prb is an active regulator of cell proliferation in the zebrafish inner ear.

similarly, regulation of zebrafish atoh1a, homolog of the hair cell differentiation gene atoh1/math <dig>  was weak at  <dig> and  <dig> dpse in our study. atoh1a is a key regulator of differentiation of precursor cells that become hair cells in mice  <cit> . atoh1a and b are also necessary for hair cell differentiation in zebrafish  <cit> . the time points investigated in this study may have been too early in the recovery process for atoh <dig> detection, as atoh <dig> only promotes the final stages of hair cell development  <cit>  and may have peaked in the majority of regenerating hair cells later than  <dig> dpse.

d. hair cell genes
comparison of our microarray dataset with the zebrafish hair cell transcriptome  <cit>  revealed common hair cell genes. we identified significant regulation in zebrafish hair cell genes encoding proteins such as creatine kinase, alpha-tubulin, keratin  <dig>  and v-fos fbj murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog. two zebrafish genes encoding creatine kinase  and creatine kinase, mitochondrial  <dig> ) were significantly regulated in our microarray dataset. muscular creatine kinase performs a variety of functions, even in non-muscle tissues and cells  <cit> . in the inner ear, creatine kinase  is required to maintain energy homeostasis through atp delivery to plasma-membrane ca2+-atpase isoform  <dig> , an ion pump required for normal sensory transduction in stereocilia of mammals and birds  <cit> . in the avian utricle, creatine kinase b is primarily localized in hair cells, and creatine kinase/mitochondrial creatine kinase isoform double knockout mice exhibit elevated hearing thresholds of 20- <dig> db at  <dig> and  <dig> khz  <cit> .

significant regulation of transcripts encoding zebrafish inner ear structural proteins was noted in our study. alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin dimers are components of all polymerized microtubules. strong labeling for alpha tubulin is seen in sensory and supporting cells of the guinea pig inner ear  <cit> . keratin  <dig> is one of the major intermediate filaments, which provide structural support throughout many tissue systems. keratin  <dig> is thought to confer resistance to apoptosis induced by fas ligand or tnf family receptors  <cit> , both of which are implicated in cisplatin- and ethacrynic acid-induced apoptosis of hair cells in chinchillas  <cit> .

v-fos genes  are highly inducible in response to a variety of growth factors and differentiation-specific inducers, and can induce bone tumors in mice  <cit> . members of the fos and jun protein families can combine to form a complex called activating protein- <dig> . ap- <dig> induction by the hair cell-toxic antibiotic gentamicin is transient and occurs exclusively in hair cells in rat organ of corti explants  <cit> . inhibitors of the upstream pathway for ap- <dig> rescue hair cells  <cit> . it should be noted that the up-regulation of some genes found in our microarray data, such as c-fos, are indicative of a general neuronal stress response in fishes  <cit> , and acoustic stimuli can induce a short-term stress response in goldfish  <cit> . thus, it is unclear if such regulation is the response from hair cell damage or auditory nerve overstimulation, but it should not be indicative of neuronal changes in brain activity since our samples only contained ear tissue.

some of the regulated genes in the current study are similar to genes highly regulated in the hair cells of other model organisms as well. avian utricular hair cell genes include parvalbumin, which serves as a mobile ca2+ buffer in the avian inner ear, alpha-tubulin, creatine kinase, heat shock protein  <dig> , and an isoform of ca2+ transporting atpase  <cit> . additionally, pou domain transcription factors, thyroid hormone receptor  <cit> , heat shock proteins  <cit> , and collagen iv alpha chain  <dig>  <cit>  have been noted in mammalian hair cells. bcl- <dig>  another regulated gene in our dataset, is believed to play an essential role in prevention of sensory cell death in guinea pigs  <cit> . thus, a number of the gene products that were regulated in the zebrafish ear following acoustic trauma have been found in hair cells or have been found to regulate hair cells.

CONCLUSIONS
microarray analysis of rna from acoustically overexposed zebrafish inner ears revealed that genes involved in multiple processes were significantly regulated, including those involved with cell proliferation, apoptosis, wound healing, signal transduction, transcription, growth, immunity, and hair cells. some of these genes are prospective targets for manipulating cell proliferation and/or improving hair cell protection during or following noise exposure. genes previously identified in the hair cells of zebrafish, and homologs of avian and mammalian hair cell genes were also noted. more work will be needed to determine the functions of these and other genes identified in acoustically-overexposed zebrafish. although a clear candidate for regulation of mammalian auditory hair cell regeneration has not been identified in this study, the data point to possible additional targets of investigation and suggest that hair cell proliferation may be accelerated through treatment with growth hormone.
