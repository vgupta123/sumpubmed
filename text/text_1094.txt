BACKGROUND
conserved neuronal signaling pathways regulate synaptic plasticity, the ability of neurons to modify synaptic connections. "long-term" forms of neuronal plasticity require new gene expression that results in persistent synaptic change . thus, long-term forms of plasticity may be perturbed, in a variety of model systems, by protein synthesis inhibitors, or manipulation of either specific signaling kinases or critical downstream transcription factors  <cit> .

a major requirement in long-term plasticity for the erk/mapk  signaling cascade acting through creb  has been supported in diverse experimental paradigms  <cit> . activation of creb has been reported to enhance long-term memory in drosophila and rodents, and long-term facilitation in the sea slug aplysia  <cit> . normal erk signaling is required for hippocampal ltp formation, for bdnf-induced forms of structural plasticity, as well as for several forms of learning and long-term memory  <cit> . for example, erk activation is necessary for the formation of conditioned taste aversion and spatial learning in rodents, and blockade of erk signaling affects long-term, but not short-term, fear conditioning  <cit> . in addition, erk regulates synapse plasticity in flies and ltf and memory in aplysia  <cit> .

many "immediate-early genes" , including members of the ap- <dig> family of transcription factors , are induced in response to diverse stimuli in the brain, such as electrical stimulation, stress, psychotropic drugs, novel experience and spatial learning  <cit> . induction of ap- <dig> mrna in neurons requires creb activation  <cit> . although roles have been established for ap- <dig> components Δfosb and c-fos in synaptic and behavioral plasticity  <cit> , the specific mechanisms and signal transduction pathways that initiate and sustain ap- <dig> dependent neuronal processes have yet to be elaborated  <cit> . for instance, the requirement for kinase-mediated modification of immediate-early transcription factors remains poorly studied in the context of neural plasticity, and early-response genes downstream of these critical iegs, have not yet been identified.

while the majority of plasticity studies have focused on creb and the erk signaling cascade  <cit> , recent studies, especially of other map-kinase family members  <cit> , lead to a broader view of the molecules involved in neuronal plasticity and memory formation. the jnk/mapk  signaling cascade and ap- <dig> proteins have recently been shown to play critical roles in long-term plasticity and memory formation in mammals  <cit> . similarly, p38/mapk mediates memory formation in the rat hippocampus  <cit>  and both short- and long-term synaptic depression in aplysia  <cit> .

as suggested by its importance in the control of processes underlying cocaine addiction  <cit> , new data indicate that ap- <dig> may widely influence transcriptional events that underlie long-term synaptic plasticity. ap- <dig>  under regulation by jnk, positively regulates both synaptic growth and synaptic strength at the drosophila neuromuscular junction   <cit> . at this synapse ap- <dig> shows a wider range of influence than creb whose effects at the same synapse are limited to controlling synaptic strength  <cit> . thus, while neural induction of fos and jun together is sufficient to cause increases in synaptic size and efficacy at the nmj, creb activation, apparently dispensable for synaptic growth, is only essential for ap- <dig> induced changes in synaptic strength  <cit> . in other neural contexts, the exact roles and mechanisms of ap- <dig> and jnk signaling in long-lasting forms of plasticity are largely unknown  <cit> . while many genes regulated during creb and Δfosb  mediated cocaine reward  <cit>  have been recently identified, this study identified exclusively late-response genes whose expression levels were altered following 5-days to 8-weeks of either Δfosb and creb overexpression in the nucleus accumbens, or cocaine injection.

here, we address two outstanding questions regarding jnk and ap- <dig> function in synaptic change. first, using temporally controlled induction of a jnk-activating kinase in the fly nervous system, we address synaptic consequences of jnk activation at the drosophila neuromuscular junction. second, using dna microarray or sage  to profile neuronal transcripts in control and experimental animals, we identify groups of neuronal genes potentially regulated by either: a) jnk, or b) ap- <dig> in the fly cns within  <dig> hours of pathway activation. some of these changes were confirmed by quantitative real-time rt-pcr , including cg <dig>  that was previously identified in a screen as a potential gene required for normal memory formation in drosophila  <cit> . we found five genes are responsive to the progesterone-related steroid ru <dig> commonly used for temporal control of gal4-restricted transgene expression in drosophila  <cit> . in addition, the mini-white gene, a common marker used in most drosophila transgenes, is induced strongly by ap- <dig> and jnk signaling. these observations and their wider implications are discussed below.

RESULTS
neuronal jnk activation triggers synaptic growth
to assess the effect of neuronal jnk activation on synaptic change we expressed an activated jnk-kinase – hemipterous   <cit>  – in the nervous system and analyzed associated phenotypic consequences. chronic overexpression of hepact with neuronal gal <dig> drivers  caused lethality ranging from late embryonic to early 2nd instar larval stages.

in order to overcome this deleterious effect, we drove expression using the inducible geneswitch gal <dig>  system to express hepact acutely in postembryonic neurons  <cit> . age-selected larvae were exposed to the inducing ligand ru <dig> between late 1st instar and early 2nd instar larval stages and allowed to develop to climbing 3rd instar larval stage. neural overexpression of hepact resulted in a 30% increase in bouton number at the larval nmj compared to the non-ru <dig> fed sibling controls . changes in synapse size may not be attributed to the effect of ru <dig> since wild-type animals fed the steroid did not show a significant change in bouton number . thus, postembryonic activation of jnk signaling in the cns leads to synaptic growth at the larval motor synapse.

jnk activation disrupts transmitter release and alters presynaptic composition
to evaluate the effect of jnk activation on transmitter release and postsynaptic response, we measured both spontaneous and evoked junctional potentials with and without jnk activation in postembryonic cns. increased hepact resulted in an unexpected 60% decrease in the amplitude of excitatory junctional potentials  . increased neuronal jnk signaling also decreased the amplitude of spontaneous responses by ~50% . the quantal content of presynaptic transmitter release shows a 30% decrease when hepact is overexpressed in postembryonic neurons . therefore, while sustained postembryonic jnk activation in the cns triggers synaptic growth, the strength of the synapse is reduced. a potential cellular mechanism that underlies this reduction in quantal content was suggested by immunohistochemical analyses of nmjs in jnk-activated animals.

presynaptic proteins including synaptic vesicle proteins, synaptotagmin, csp and antigen recognized by anti-hrp were substantially decreased when jnk was activated in motor neurons . levels of syt staining were reduced by 45%, csp by 30% and anti-hrp by 50% . in contrast, postsynaptically enriched proteins, fasciclin ii and dlg, do not show any change in intensity.

because jnk has been implicated in axonal transport, we asked whether transport defects could possibly explain how jnk alters presynaptic composition  <cit> . defects in axonal cytoskeletal assembly or anterograde axonal transport cause accumulation of syt positive puncta on axonal tracts  <cit> . such organelle jams were not present in axonal tracts of larvae overexpressing hepact. the nerves were indistinguishable from control animals, indicating that visible axonal transport defects are not present after overexpression of hepact . for the purposes of this study, these results simply point to potential effects of jnk activation in the cns that go beyond its previously defined role as a positive regulator of ap- <dig> and, thereby, of synaptic growth and synaptic strength  <cit> .

genome-wide screen to identify jnk targets in neurons
to identify transcriptional targets of jnk signaling in the nervous system we performed a genome-wide analysis of jnk-responsive genes in the drosophila larval cns using serial analysis of gene expression . sage is an approach that has been extensively used in analyzing expression changes in cancer cells and other disease states as well as to analyze gene expression in the drosophila embryo and developing eye  <cit> . sage is based on generating unique  <dig> bp tags at a defined position in almost every transcript and, following random sequencing of some  <dig>  cdnas, analyzing the frequency at which each tag  occurs in a sample rna. we used sage to a) profile gene expression in the fly central nervous system; and b) identify transcriptional targets of neuronal jnk signaling. to identify early mediators of synaptic change, we analyzed rna expression  <dig> hours after jnk activation. we induced a 6-hour burst of neural hepact expression in third-instar larval nervous systems using ru <dig> feeding to induce transcription mediated by neural gs-gal <dig>  in experimental elavgs-gal4-hepact animals, we confirmed that jnk signaling was significantly activated by performing the following tests. quantitative pcr demonstrated a 16-fold induction of hep mrna in larval cns after hepact overexpression  . rna in situ hybridization of ru <dig> exposed larval cns showed a marked increase in hep mrna localization in the entire larval cns . immunostaining with an antibody specific for phsophorylated jnk showed induction of hepact mrna leads to activation of jnk . finally, we observed that downstream gene expression of a jnk target gene puc occurs after hepact induction in the cns. puc mrna is induced nearly 3-fold  by q-pcr analysis  and in an "enhancer trap" lacz line we were able to visualize puc promoter activity in the larval cns . thus, our protocol to stimulate neural jnk is sufficient to induce an established downstream target of jnk signaling. exposure of identically cultured, wild-type animals to ru <dig> did not lead to induction of hep or puc mrna or lead to activation of jnk . hence, changes observed between ru <dig> treated and untreated animals should be largely attributable to jnk signaling in the larval cns.

we sequenced approximately  <dig>  tags from individual libraries prepared from dissected larval nervous systems of either control or hepact expressing animals. about  <dig> unique sage tags represented in these libraries were associated with specific genes/genomic sequences using either a database containing predicted tags of all genes annotated by the bdgp  <cit>  or blast searches to identify other transcription units  <cit> . approximately 10% of tags with less than  <dig> matches to the genome mapped to regions with no predicted gene. about  <dig> % of all tags did not match the genome probably due to polymorphisms, errors in sequencing or possible gaps in the published drosophila genome sequence. comparison of the top  <dig> expressed genes in the cns sage library to embryonic and photoreceptor sage libraries revealed that while 32% of these genes are highly expressed in all  <dig> tissues such as the cytoskeletal protein betatub56d, 37% are enriched in the nervous system like the translation elongation factor ef1alpha100e . such comparisons could prove useful for understanding transcriptional regulation and other processes in different tissues .

potential jnk-target genes were identified by comparing the relative representation of specific tags in control and hepact expressing nervous systems . a tag was considered up or downregulated when present  <dig> or more times in a given library and changed at least 3-fold between the two libraries. by these criteria,  <dig> tags were increased while  <dig> were decreased following jnk induction. of these,  <dig> were "upregulated" and  <dig> "downregulated" more than 8-fold. approximately 50% of the induced or repressed tags in the hepact library mapped to genes that fell into different functional classes, ~35% of these tags mapped to genes that have no predicted function and ~10% mapped to parts of the genome without any predicted genes .

to determine whether predictions of sage could be confirmed by more careful single gene analyses, we performed q-pcr to measure relative levels of expression of selected candidate jnk-target genes in control and jnk-induced nervous systems. we selected  <dig> candidate genes for such q-pcr verification based on: 1) an abundance of tags for that gene in the hepact induced library ; 2) an interesting known function for the gene ; 3) presence of ap- <dig> binding sites in the promoter region of the gene ; and 4) random selection of genes that did not fall into the above criteria . from the  <dig> genes so examined,  <dig> that showed induction in at least two independent rt-pcr analyses were analyzed further, namely more extensive q-pcr analyses using rnas from  <dig> independent jnk-induction experiments. in the end, only three genes showed consistent jnk-responsiveness  . white showed consistent and robust increases in mrna levels, whereas appl and cher showed smaller magnitude inductions. to test if some of the candidate jnk target genes were robustly regulated in subsets of neurons, but diluted out in the q-pcr analysis, we examined the expression of rna in the larval cns using in situ hybridizations with probes for several candidate mrnas. we did not see a clear increase in expression in any of the putative target genes in hepact expressing larval cnss other than white .

the small number of sage-predicted jnk target genes confirmed by rna in situ and q-pcr analyses was difficult to explain without multiple repetitions for which sage, being expensive and time-consuming, is not ideally suited. also, we speculated that genes expressed at lower levels than those identified by sage may be true jnk/ap- <dig> target genes. to test and further these considerations, we used a different genomic approach – oligonucleotide microarrays – to search for neuronal ap- <dig> target genes.

whole-genome microarray screen to identify direct ap- <dig> target genes in the nervous system
we performed comprehensive analyses of transcript levels in fly heads using affymetrix drosophila genome <dig> genechip arrays representing the entire annotated genome at the time of its release . an outline of the microarray screen design is illustrated in figure  <dig>  the analysis compared mrna levels, with or without ap- <dig> induction using the same conditional gs-gal <dig> strategy described for the previous sage analysis. after treatment with ru <dig> for  <dig> hours to induce fos and jun we consistently achieved, respectively, ~ <dig> - and 9-fold induction of fos and jun transcripts in fly heads . untreated control animals showed no significant difference of either gene when levels were compared between age-matched siblings from the same experiment .

each array "experiment" included sibling flies split into three groups: group a was the experimental  population . thus, each experiment typically allowed transcript levels  to be compared between experimental and control samples , and between two identically treated controls . candidate ap- <dig> responsive transcripts would be identified as those with "a/b" and "a/c" ratios significantly different from control "b/c" ratios. this experimental design was useful because hybridization signals for some mrnas varied significantly more than others and could potentially confound a more straightforward analysis. through 5– <dig> repetitions of this basic experiment, we obtained  <dig> independent experimental versus control ratios, and  <dig> control-control ratios from which means, variances and sems could be determined. sibling, age-matched controls used in each experiment ensured that genetic background, which can have a large effect on transcriptional variance  <cit> , was not a confounding factor in our analyses.

based on analyses of  <dig> hybridizations we established that basic elements of the array technology, probe labeling, hybridization and scanning, were working efficiently and reproducibly . microarray hybridization data were passed through three statistical filters to select the most promising ap- <dig> responsive genes . filter 1: we asked that the average ratio of hybridization signal from ap- <dig> induced versus control mrna hybridization was significantly  different from  <dig>  by student's t-test. filter 2: we asked that the signal ratio be greater than  <dig> . filter 3: through analysis of variation observed in identical control-control comparisons, we ensured that genes passing filters  <dig> and  <dig> did not show wide variability, for instance based on physiological states of the flies.

using filter 1: of the ~ <dig> genes considered for analysis ,  <dig> showed altered expression after ap- <dig> induction, with a significance of p <  <dig>  . strikingly,  <dig> genes showed significant upregulation while only  <dig> were downregulated, a skew consistent with ap-1's expected role as a transcriptional activator.  <dig> candidates, at p <  <dig> , is substantially larger than predicted by random chance . however, when a second filter – a requirement that the signal ratio modulus be greater than  <dig>  – was applied, the number of candidates dropped to  <dig>  though small, such signal ratios could correspond to higher mrna ratios and have been reported as meaningful in previous microarray experiments. filter  <dig>  to eliminate "variable" genes, trimmed the list of candidate genes that respond consistently to ap- <dig> overexpression in the fly head to either  <dig>  or  <dig>  for which "a/b" and "a/c" ratios were significantly greater than control "b/c" values by student's t-test.

an internal control for the array screen and analysis was provided by drosophila jun , whose mrna was experimentally induced. we found that jun ranked highest once all three filters were applied and showed robust induction with an average log <dig> treated expression ratio of  <dig>   and an average untreated expression change of only - <dig>  . in contrast, fos did not pass these stringent filters although we consistently observed an average  <dig> -fold increase in fos transcript levels by quantitative rt-pcr . this discrepancy may arise from either of two limitations: a) that fos is a low-abundance transcript in the fly head, below the threshold for quantifiable gene expression change detection using affymetrix genechip arrays; or b) the fos probe on this particular array may not perform reliably  <cit> , perhaps hybridizing to other non-specific rna probes. many gene probes could have similar problems; indeed, other transcripts may exhibit altered expression levels beyond the scope and sensitivity of this assay.

we searched promoters  of the top  <dig> candidate ap- <dig> responsive genes for conserved ap- <dig> or creb binding sites and compared their frequencies of occurrence in this group with frequencies observed in a control group of  <dig> genes that appeared insensitive to ap- <dig> induction. this analysis revealed no significant enrichment of creb or ap- <dig> binding elements in promoters selected based on the microarray experiments .

microarray screen validation
a major task after initial microarray screening has been completed is confirmation of candidate gene transcript level changes using secondary, independent tests for gene expression. although the frequency of false-positives is substantially reduced through repetition, a subset of observed expression differences should be validated by other methods.

to confirm positives, a subset of the most robustly changing ap-1-responsive genes, exhibiting significant up- or down-regulation by microarray analysis, were selected as candidates for real-time quantitative rt-pcr validation using gene specific primers .  <dig> genes chosen from the group of  <dig> top candidates mentioned above, in addition to more than  <dig> genes from outside this stringent set – those with very low "p" values or specific predicted biological functions – were selected for these more careful confirmatory experiments. increases in transcript levels following ap- <dig> overexpression, detected by q-pcr, for fos, jun and  <dig> confirmed candidate genes  are shown in figure 8a. all mrna levels are normalized to the control gene rp <dig>  transcript levels for a second control gene, gapdh <dig>  are shown to demonstrate its levels do not change significantly by either ap- <dig> induced versus control  or control-control  comparisons.

five uncharacterized genes  were confirmed by q-pcr to be consistently altered in ru486-treated, ap- <dig> induced samples . in addition, overexpression of fbz with ru <dig> treatment also caused a similar change in transcript levels of these  <dig> genes. when treated with the steroid, wild type flies and all other transgenic lines tested showed consistent alterations of these  <dig> mrna transcripts in the head, suggesting they are hormone-responsive genes in the fly.

as in the larval cns, q-pcr experiments confirmed white gene induction in the adult fly head. white transcript levels are significantly increased in the head following ap- <dig> overexpression in the brain . further q-pcr experiments demonstrated white transcripts are increased to an even greater extent when hepact is induced in combination with ap- <dig> or by itself in the adult nervous system , although its levels are not increased to the degree seen in the larval cns . white is not induced when fbz is overexpressed, nor in wild type flies treated with ru <dig>  only primers designed to the 3' portion of the white transcript showed altered levels , which is consistent with the background strain used in all the experiments. this strain lacks the 5' portion of the white gene locus  <cit> , yet still contains sequence for and expresses the second through fifth exons  that are induced in response to jnk signaling in the fly head. the same transcriptional induction profile is observed in elavgs-gal4-hepact flies with the wild-type  copy of the white gene on the x chromosome as well as in a white null  background . this suggests white induction occurs via the mini-white cassette present in puast transgenes. rna in situ hybridization experiments confirmed the increase in mini-white transcript levels in the cns of larvae in which hepact has been induced . increases were also observed in larvae overexpressing ap- <dig> , albeit with smaller magnitude changes consistent with our findings from q-pcr analyses in the adult head .

cg <dig> induction following ap- <dig> overexpression was also confirmed in independent q-pcr experiments . consistent increases in transcript levels were observed in all ap- <dig> overexpressing heads but not in treated fbz or wild type heads . the induction observed by quantitative rt-pcr and microarray experiments was not reflected in follow-up in situ experiments; however, this is likely because the small magnitude increases in transcript levels observed by other means  are below the detection range for this method.

discussion
this extensive study makes three contributions:  it demonstrates unexpected and novel interactions between jnk and cellular processes that underlie synapse plasticity;  by sage analyses, it provides a genomic profile of mrnas expressed in the fly larval nervous system;  it presents two large-scale genomic approaches to identify jnk and ap- <dig> targets in the fly cns providing useful data pertinent to jnk/ap- <dig> signaling in neurons as well as to genomic analyses in the drosophila nervous system.

effects of jnk activation in postembryonic motorneruons
the immediate-early transcription factor ap- <dig> positively regulates both synapse size and synapse strength at the drosophila larval nmj  <cit> . while jnk signaling is necessary for the effect of ap- <dig> on synapse structure and function, it is not clear whether jnk signaling is sufficient for synaptic change. we show, first, that activation of jnk in post-embryonic neurons leads to significant synaptic alterations; second, that these alterations are inconsistent with jnk functioning solely through ap- <dig>  our finding that activation of jnk signaling leads to an increase in synapse number but decreases synapse strength indicates that jnk activates not only ap- <dig>  a positive regulator of growth and strength, but also a pathway that negatively influences synaptic strength.

the neural transcriptome, and its regulation by jnk and ap-1
the ability of sage to evaluate absolute expression levels of gene transcripts enables relatively facile, quantitative, profiling of gene expression in any given tissue . given the intense interest in drosophila neurobiology, a previous painstaking sequence analysis of some  <dig> cdnas from a fly brain cdna library provided useful new information on the neural transcriptome  <cit> . the analysis presented here, following sequencing of about  <dig>  ests from two independent brain libraries, substantially extends the previous study. the use of this resource is demonstrated by our simple survey of highly expressed neuronal rna-binding proteins, potentially involved in important neural-specific, post-transcriptional functions such as translational repression, mrna transport or rna editing. 10% of the  <dig> most highly expressed  mrnas in nervous system encode rna-binding proteins,  <dig> of which are enriched in neurons versus embryonic tissue. a significant fraction of these  have conserved homologs recently found on rna granules, organelles containing translationally repressed mrnas which are actively transported to synaptic sites  <cit> . we have recently begun functional analyses of some of these rna-binding proteins. similarly, we anticipate that identification of tissue-specific genes could provide unanticipated launch points for investigation into their cellular functions.

given the evidence to indicate wide effects of ap- <dig> and jnk on synaptic properties, we searched for ap- <dig> and jnk-target genes using both sage and microarray approaches to determine effects of jnk and ap- <dig> signaling on neuronal gene expression. of the two approaches, microarray analysis, being dependent on parameters such as hybridization and labeling efficiencies that vary among individual transcripts, is not ideal for quantitative analyses as outlined in the previous section. however, it provides information on transcripts with low to moderate levels of expression, is fast, and allows multiple iterations of each experiment at a small cost relative to sage.

in order to identify early transcriptional targets, most likely to link jnk and ap- <dig> activation to synaptic change, we used the steroid-inducible gal <dig> system, an increasingly popular strategy to achieve conditional, tissue-specific transgene expression in drosophila  <cit> . sage-derived transcript profiles of rna extracted from whole larval cnss showed several potentially significant targets. however, very few were confirmed by secondary low-throughput, gene-specific analyses. microarray-derived transcript profiles of adult head mrna showed similar results. several statistically significant targets of ap- <dig> signaling were initially identified; however, few were confirmed by carefully controlled application of the most commonly used transcript-specific analyses . while the implications of these results for neurogenomics are briefly discussed in the next section, we first consider the "positive" genes identified by sage and microarray screens.

quantitative rt-pcr validation of the generated sage data resulted in the identification of  <dig> genes, cher, appl and white, which were consistently upregulated following jnk activation in the larval cns. though we were unable to evaluate induction of cher and appl by rna in situ hybridization, white showed robust increases by this method as it did by q-pcr. a total of seven expression changes identified in the microarray screen were verified by q-pcr analysis; remarkably, five turned out to be genes responding to ru <dig> treatment itself rather than to consequent ap- <dig> induction. these steroid-responsive genes may be of significant biological interest. however, from our point of view they serve primarily to: a) further establish the bonafides of our experimental and analytical protocols; and b) as a useful caution for drosophilists and others using the steroid-inducible conditional expression system. the remaining two confirmed ap- <dig> target genes were w hite, also identified in the sage screen but shown eventually to be expressed from the p-element associated mini-white locus, and cg <dig>  of potential significance, cg <dig> has been implicated in olfactory associative memory  <cit> .

ap- <dig> responsiveness of cg <dig> was verified in q-pcr validation experiments . the gene was previously found in a mutational screen for putative memory genes required for normal olfactory conditioning in drosophila  <cit> . in addition, it is one of the few genes from the list of likely ap- <dig> targets  that has a conserved ap- <dig> binding site within  <dig> base pairs of its translation start site. it is therefore a promising candidate warranting further investigation into the role it plays in synaptic plasticity and memory formation.

lessons and limitations
it appears unlikely, if not inconceivable, that the  <dig> probable downstream genes enumerated above could mediate the demonstrated effects of ap- <dig> or jnk induction on motor-synapse properties. thus, the genomic approaches we have followed, while informative, have likely not led to the identification of jnk/ap- <dig> targets that link these signals to synaptic change. one possible interpretation, that the experiments were technically flawed, appears to be ruled out, not only because internal controls  were identified in the screens, but also because various standards for microarray hybridization data and sage library complexity were evaluated and shown to be well within the technically optimal range. thus, we are left with the second interpretation, that analysis of whole-brain mrna may not allow targets of signaling pathways to be unambiguously identified. a major issue is likely to be cell-type heterogeneity within the brain. if different subsets of neurons show substantially different genomic responses to jnk/ap- <dig> , then altered expression of the meaningful jnk/ap- <dig> targets in a subset of cells may be diluted by the large background of mrna deriving from other neuronal types.

at a conceptual level, barolo and posakony have nicely articulated the concept of "activator insufficiency" and the need for cooperative activation of multiple transcription factors for turning on transcriptional pathways governing developmental processes  <cit> . considerable evidence argues that neurons are a diverse class of cells with a range of distinct transcriptional ground states. for example, cell-type-specific binding of creb to known target gene promoters has been shown in various cell types under basal and stimulated conditions  <cit> . similarly, the response of different neuronal populations to tgfβ has been shown to be highly context dependent and to derive from variations in expression of specific tgfβ insensitive transcription factors  <cit> . thus, genomic analyses when applied to whole nervous systems may have significant intrinsic limitations.

nevertheless, some conserved downstream genes may still be revealed  <cit> . for instance, the steroid hormone, ru <dig>  used to induce transgene expression in our experiments presumably activates a set of hormone-responsive genes in a large subset of neural cells. however, for incisive mechanistic analyses for which drosophila is so convenient, we suggest that genome-wide screens described to study signaling responses in the nervous system be applied with specific refinements, such as emerging methodologies to prepare sufficient mrna from a homogeneous population of cells in which biological function of these signaling pathways have been evaluated  <cit> . various gfp transgene lines should make it possible to sort specific cell populations prior to genomic screens to identify transcriptional targets.

the availability of new genetic and molecular tools and refined functional genomic approaches should result in continued understanding of how kinases and transcription factors regulate molecular changes that occur in the drosophila nervous system, as well as intrinsic flexibility and constraints of these signaling pathways.

CONCLUSIONS
this study revealed unexpected relationships between jnk signaling and synaptic plasticity in drosophila that are inconsistent with a role for jnk acting solely through ap- <dig> to affect strength of the synapse. it also presents a profile of the transcriptome of the larval nervous system and, while providing potential transcriptional targets of jnk and ap- <dig> signaling in neurons, points out the pitfalls of genome-wide analyses in complex tissues such as the whole fly nervous system.
