BACKGROUND
endogenous small rnas, which consist of micrornas  and short interfering rnas , are important regulators of organ development, stress responses and genomic stability in plants  <cit> . roles of mirnas and sirnas in biotic and abiotic stress responses, e.g., viral infection, have been demonstrated in plants by many studies  <cit> . mirnas downregulated or upregulated in plants infected with virus, such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  might play a role in interactions between virus and plants  <cit> . plant endogenous sirna-mediated gene silencing was found to be involved in plant biotic stress, for example, bacteria-induced nat-sirnaatgb <dig> regulates r-gene mediated plant immunity  <cit> . rice stripe virus infection enhanced the accumulation of phased mirnas from a particular precursor  <cit> .

plant mirnas can trigger the production of phased secondary sirnas  from either non-coding  or protein-coding genes . trans-acting sirnas  are distinctive sirnas, which are generated from tas transcripts in 21-nucleotide  phases in relative to the mirna cleavage site. they act in trans to regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. biogenesis of tasirnas is triggered by interaction of mirna at single or dual ends of the precursor tas transcripts  <cit> . there are at least eight tas loci that belong to four tas families  in arabidopsis and four tas <dig> loci have been identified in rice  <cit> . recent studies demonstrated that plant genomes are rich in phased sirna -producing loci, or phas genes  <cit> , and may harbor hundreds of these loci in protein-coding genes  <cit> . for example, a batch of 21-nt and 24-nt phasirnas triggered by mir <dig> and mir <dig>  respectively, were identified in the developing inflorescence of rice  <cit> . biogenesis of phasirnas and their roles in posttranscriptional regulation have been well discussed in a recent review  <cit> .

geminiviruses are a group of single-stranded dna viruses that cause devastating economic losses worldwide. four genera  have been classified according to genome organizations, host ranges and transmission vectors, with begomovirus being the most numerous and geographically wide-spread  <cit> . begomoviruses have either monopartite or bipartite genomes. in the past decade, several studies have shown that many monopartite begomoviruses have acquired a betasatellite, formerly called dnaβ, and βc <dig>  the sole betasatellite-encoded protein, plays essential roles in symptom induction, in suppression of transcriptional and posttranscriptional gene silencing, and also involves in suppression of selected jasmonic acid responses  <cit> . tomato yellow leaf curl china virus  is a monopartite begomovirus associated with a betasatellite . tylccnv alone produced asymptomatic infection in nicotiana benthamiana and tomato plants. tylccnb is essential for induction of leaf curl symptoms in these host plants when co-infected with tylccnv. tylccnb mutants unable to express the βc <dig> protein abolished its ability to induce typical symptoms in plants when co-inoculated with tylccnv  <cit> . in our previous study, we identified tylccnv- and tylccnb-derived sirnas by deep sequencing small rnas from systemically infected n. benthamiana plant leaves and found that viral transcript might act as rna dependent rna polymerase  substrates resulting in secondary sirna production  <cit> . however, plant mirna profiles regulated by tylccnb remain largely unknown. recent release of the draft genome sequence of n. benthamiana  <cit>  provides an opportunity to identify mirnas and sirnas from the host plant and investigate expression changes of host mirnas and sirnas in response to viral infection. in this study, we identified n. benthamiana mirnas based on the draft genome and our previously generated small rna datasets using n. benthamiana plants infected with begomovirus, and found a number of mirnas, including a few putative phasirna triggers, were responsive to co-infection of tylccnv and tylccnb but not to tylccnv and a mutated tylccnb in n. benthamiana.

RESULTS
identification of mirnas in n. benthamiana
the n. benthamiana plant leaves systemically infected with tylccnv  alone , or co-infected with tylccnv and its betasatellite tylccnb  or a tylccnb mutant  were harvested for rna extraction and small rna sequencing  <cit> . in the  <dig>  million small rna reads or  <dig>  million unique reads from n. benthamiana leaves, a total of  <dig>  million reads or  <dig>  million unique reads could be mapped to the n. benthamiana genome . using the approach described in the methods and based on blast search against the public mirna database , we identified a total of  <dig> conserved mirnas from  <dig> families in the n. benthamiana genome . meanwhile, a total of  <dig> novel mirnas from  <dig> families were also identified . a further search  of these novel mature mirna sequences against the small rna populations from n. tabacum recently generated by us  <cit>  showed that  <dig> novel n. benthamiana mirnas is conserved in n. tabacum. target prediction indicated  <dig>  novel mirnas had at least one potential target . expression of two novel mirnas, nbe-mir <dig> and nbe-mir <dig>  together with the conserved mir <dig> could be detected by northern blot, although the expression levels of the two novel mirnas were much lower than that of mir <dig> , consistent with the well known phenomenon for lowly expressed non-conserved mirnas.

identification of putative phasirna triggers
based on the draft genome of n. benthamiana and the algorithm described by howell et al.  <cit>  , we found that over thousands of loci were able to generate 21-nt and 24-nt phasirnas . of these phasirna loci, mirna binding site could be predicted in at least  <dig> of 21-nt and  <dig> of 24-nt phasirna loci , suggesting that these mirnas are putative phasirna triggers in n. benthamiana . for these potential phasirna triggers or phase registers, their putative cleavage sites  were all located at a phase position. a total of  <dig> conserved mirnas from  <dig> families which could bind to phas loci were found, e.g., mir <dig> and mir <dig> . more than  <dig> phas loci seem to be triggered by n. benthamiana or nicotiana-specific mirnas, such as nbe-mir <dig> . one example was shown in figure  <dig>  in which nbe-mir <dig>  a novel n. benthamiana mirna, was predicted to trigger production of 21-nt phased small rnas in a n. benthamiana gene. in addition to non-coding transcript, such as tas genes, many protein-coding genes were also identified as mirna-triggered phas loci in n. benthamiana , including some loci targeted by conserved mirnas, such as mir <dig> and mir <dig> , which have been shown to generate phasirnas from protein-coding genes in several recent studies  <cit> . when an extremely strict phase score  was applied,  <dig> and  <dig> loci generating 21-nt and 24-nt phasirnas, respectively, could still be identified.

expression profiles of mirnas responsive to co-infection of tylccnv/ tylccnb
previous reports showed that some mirnas were differentially expressed after virus infection  <cit> . in this study, our focus was on the mirnas responsive to betasatellite  associated with tylccnv, i.e. those with a similar expression level in plants infected with tylccnv  and co-infected with tylccnv and a mutated tylccnb  but with an up- or down-regulated expression level in plants co-infected with tylccnv and a functional tylccnb . with the criteria of  <dig> -fold changes in y10a + y10β versus both y10a and y10a + y10mβ and rpm  ≥  <dig> in at least one of the three samples, we found that among the conserved mirnas, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were up-regulated whereas mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were down-regulated in responsive to tylccnb, and that among the novel mirnas, nbe-mir <dig>  nbe-mir <dig>  nbe-mir <dig>  nbe-mir <dig> and nbe-mir <dig> were up-regulated whereas nbe-mir <dig>  nbe-mir <dig> and nbe-mir <dig> were down-regulated in responsive to tylccnb . up-regulation of nbe-mir <dig> was confirmed by northern blot . in addition, down-regulation of mir <dig> observed in plants co-infected with tylccnv and a functional tylccnb, i.e. y10a + y10β, was also confirmed by the northern blot results; consequently, an up-regulation of its target gene aca <dig>  was detected by rt-qpcr .

the majority of mirnas had a similar expression level in n. benthamiana plants systemically infected with tylccnv alone  and co-infected with tylccnv and a mutant betasatellite tylccnb  , confirming an un-functional βc <dig> in the mutated tylccnb. this result also suggests that the aforementioned mirnas that were responsive to betasatellite most likely indeed have a role in interaction between begomovirus and n. benthamiana. interestingly, some of the differentially expressed mirnas, such as mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  were putative triggers of phasirna production .

discussion
the involvement of mirnas in diverse biotic responses  has been demonstrated by recent studies  <cit> . our study confirmed that the expression of host mirnas  is affected in response to betasatellite. there are at least two different kinds of mirnas: one is suppressed by the viral suppressors of rna silencing  while another is involved in anti-pathogen  by regulating plant innate immune receptors or hormone signaling pathway. viral encoded proteins interfere with host rnai pathways and thus distort the normal cellular activities  <cit> . they can bind directly to host mirnas and therefore making non-function of rna-induced silencing complex . mirnas are key regulatory molecules in diverse biological processes in plants, for example, mir <dig>  mir159/ <dig> for leaf development  <cit> . apparently, the typical leaf curl symptoms in n. benthamiana induced by co-infection of tylccnv and its betasatellite tylccnb could be caused by deregulation of those differentially accumulated mirnas in responsive to betasatellite . the differentially down-regulated mir <dig> in n. benthamiana plants co-infected with tylccnv and tylccnb was predicted to target an aca gene and could also be involved in leaf development, because a recent study showed that mir <dig> targets aca <dig> gene and plays a critical role in tomato reproductive growth  <cit> . in addition, the mirnas, such as mir <dig>  that were up-regulated in plants co-infected with tylccnv and a mutated tylccnb but the up-regulation level was much smaller than that in plants co-infected with tylccnv and a functional tylccnb could also have a role in response to betasatellite.

recent studies demonstrated a role of mirna-mediated phasirna pathway in diverse biological processes, including pathogen resistance  <cit> . for example, mir482/2118-mediated cleavage of disease resistance nbs-lrr genes not only plays an important role in non-race specific disease resistance but triggers production of phased small rnas that are able to regulate the expression of their targets in trans  <cit> . upon pathogen infection, the expression level of mir <dig> was down-regulated and consequently its targets, nbs-lrr genes, were up-regulated  <cit> . mir482/ <dig> belongs to a specific type of mirna that generated from pre-mirnas containing asymmetric bulges in the mirna/mirna* duplex and has been demonstrated to be the trigger for production of phased 21-nt secondary small rnas from their target transcripts through the rdr6/dcl <dig> pathway  <cit> . therefore, mir482/2118-mediated cleavage of target disease resistance genes is expected to cause both decay of their target mrnas and production of phased secondary small rnas from the target genes, such as shown in tomato, cotton and medicago truncatula  <cit> . furthermore, at least one of the secondary small rnas generated from a mir <dig> targeted nbs-lrr gene has been shown to target mrna encoding another defense-related protein  <cit> , indicating that the secondary small rnas generated from protein-coding genes can behave like tas loci in arabidopsis  <cit> . in this study, the expression level of mir <dig> was up-regulated in n. benthamiana plants co-infected with tylccnv and tylccnb compared to plants infected with tylccnv alone, which is in contrast with previous observation. meanwhile, this up-regulation of mir <dig> was also observed in plants co-infected with tylccnv and a mutated tylccnb . therefore, more investigation is required to understand the function of mir <dig> in response to betasatellite. in addition to mir <dig>  several other betasatellite-responsive mirnas, such as mir <dig> and mir <dig>  were potential triggers of phasirnas , suggesting that both these mirnas and the phasirnas generated from targets of these mirnas could play a role in interaction between begomovirus and n. benthamiana.

CONCLUSIONS
a total of  <dig> conserved mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were found in the genome of n. benthamiana. among them, several showed a differential expression pattern in n. benthamiana plants co-infected with tylccnv and tylccnb and co-infected with tylccnv and a mutated tylccnb, suggesting a role of these mirnas in interaction between the betasatellite associated with begomovirus and n. benthamiana plants. in addition, our study showed that several of these differentially expressed mirnas were potential triggers for production of phasirnas.
