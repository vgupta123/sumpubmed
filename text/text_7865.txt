BACKGROUND
huntington’s disease  is a fatal progressive neurodegeneration with motor, cognitive and psychiatric manifestations. it is caused by an expansion of a cag triplet repeat in exon  <dig> of the htt gene, which is translated to give an expanded glutamine tract at the n-terminus of the protein, huntingtin   <cit> . a series of genetic mouse models of the disease have been generated using various technologies to give transgenic and knock in models of the disease that include both truncated and full-length htt . these models have been tested in multiple behavioural paradigms and show deficits in tests of motor ability and in cognitive and behavioural assessments .

changes in gene expression have also been seen in the brains and other tissues of the mouse models of hd. these changes show a substantial overlap between the various mouse models tested and also overlap with gene expression changes seen in human hd brain  <cit> . the profiles of genes with reduced expression appear to overlap to greater extent between models and between models and human brain than those with increased expression  <cit> . treatments that alleviate the decreased expression can improve the phenotype in mouse models, whether directed at transcriptional mechanisms or not .

the yac <dig> model of hd carries a full length human htt gene in a gse <dig> artificial chromosome, and extensive behavioural testing has shown that it displays substantial phenotypes that correlate with human hd symptoms from a relatively early age  <cit>  including affective symptoms  <cit> . deficits on the rotarod were observed from 4 months of age and persisted throughout life, and deficits on the balance beam occurred from 8 months  <cit> . in the water maze, reduced ability to find the hidden platform was seen at 8– <dig> months with reversal learning showing deficits from 4 months  <cit> . deficits in reversal learning in a set-shifting task were seen by 6 months and of extra-dimensional set-shifting at 16 months  <cit> , although no implicit learning deficits were observed in these mice  <cit> . despite these early changes in the behavioural phenotype of the mice, frank neuronal inclusions were only visible from 15 months of age, although diffuse staining with antibodies that detect inclusions was seen from 12 months of age  <cit> .

as hd affects the caudate and putamen earliest and most profoundly and shows substantial gene expression dysregulation  <cit>  we chose to examine mouse striatum, as the nearest equivalent, in order to investigate whether dysregulated gene expression also occurred in the yac <dig> striatum. we examined global gene expression changes in the striata from wild-type  and transgenic mice from the yac <dig> mouse line at  <dig>   <dig> and 18 months. we observed alterations in gene expression at all time points, which overlapped with changes seen in human hd brain and in other mouse models of the disease. we observed that genes downregulated with age in normal mice tended to be even more decreased in expression in the yac <dig> striata.

RESULTS
the effects of age on gene expression
between  <dig> and 12 months,  <dig> mrnas  are altered in abundance in the wt animals and  <dig> mrnas  in the yac <dig> animals . of these,  <dig> mrnas , more than expected by chance, occur in both sets . between  <dig> and 18 months, more mrnas are altered:  <dig> mrna  <dig> genes) in wt mice and  <dig>  in yac <dig> mice, of which  <dig> mrna  are common to both cohorts . the overlapping probesets and corresponding genes are given in additional file 1: table s <dig>  a go term enrichment analysis  shows that few pathways show an over-representation of significantly differentially expressed genes: only translation  in the wt 6– <dig> month striata and cell adhesion  in the yac <dig> 6– <dig> month striata are close to significance. translation does not appear as even nominally significant in the yac <dig> data, nor cell adhesion in the wt data . between  <dig> – 18 months several processes are significantly over-represented in both wt and yac <dig> striata , including neuronal processes in both cohorts. cell adhesion  is significantly over-represented in the yac <dig> striata over this time period.table  <dig> pathways altered with age in mouse striatum in yac <dig> mice

the probesets and genes that were significant over time are given in table s <dig> and the full list of pathways in table s <dig>  count is the total number of significantly differentially expressed probesets in the go category and global is the number of genes in that go category.



effects of genotype on gene expression
analysis between genotypes shows that  <dig> probesets  are dysregulated between yac <dig> and wt animals when using data from all time points , of which  <dig> are up-regulated and  <dig> are down-regulated in the yac <dig> striata. using an fdr threshold of p >  <dig> ,  <dig> probesets are dysregulated ,  <dig> down- and  <dig> up-regulated. analysing the time points individually, at 6 months  <dig> , at 12 months  <dig>  and at 18 months  <dig> probesets  are altered in expression . between  <dig> and 12 months  <dig> probesets  are altered in abundance at both times  and between  <dig> and 18 months there are  <dig> such probesets  .table  <dig> probesets dysregulated between genotypes


probsets annotated to genes with a significant difference  between the two genotypes are given. each gene corresponds to a single probeset unless indicated otherwise, the probeset of lowest p-value for all ages has been quoted in such cases. fc = fold change, absfc = absolute fold change.



the tanova analysis  highlights a set of  <dig> probesets  dysregulated between genotypes but also includes the trajectory of change in expression over time. seventy-six genes are common to the tanova and limma fdr p <  <dig>  analyses. the tanova results show that if the trajectory of gene expression with increased age is towards decreasing mrna abundance, then these genes are much more likely to be decreased in expression in the striata of yac <dig> mice compared with wild-type:  <dig> such differentially expressed genes decreased in expression in yac <dig> mice compared with  <dig> increased in expression. the opposite is true for genes increased in expression with age in the yac <dig> mouse striatum: these are more likely to be increased in expression in the yac <dig> striata:  <dig> increased compared with  <dig> decreased mrnas. the full tanova plots of gene expression over time are given in additional file 4: figure s <dig> fig.  <dig> patterns of expression identified using tanova. each different pattern is illustrated by one gene showing a significant change in expression over time and between genotypes. the gene id and the affymetrix probeset id are given. expression is given as log- <dig> fold change and the time points are in months. wt = wild-type and hd = yac128

numbers of genes significant for each tanova pattern of change over time, given as number : some genes showed a mixed pattern of change and have not been included. nc = no change. for instance in the top left hand corner,  <dig> genes were seen to increase in expression with age in yac <dig> and wild-type striata, and of those  <dig> were reduced in expression in wt compared with yac <dig> expression and  <dig> were increased in expression compared with yac <dig> expression.



an over-representation analysis using ease and david  <cit>  of the differentially expressed genes by tanova does not reveal any over-represented categories, probably due to the small numbers of genes within each pattern of change. however, an over-representation analysis of the full sets of genes identified by limma analysis  shows that the largest number of pathways are identified by the down-regulated genes and that these are mostly related to g-protein and other intracellular signalling pathways. an examination of the genes that contribute to these significant processes shows that there are substantial overlaps of genes amongst these significant categories and that the most specific pathway highlighted  is go: <dig>  transmission of nerve impulse. categories relating to nervous transmission and synaptic events appear as nominally significant even if they are not signficant once the fdr correction has been applied . in order to highlight the most significant functional relationships in the data we conducted a david analysis  <cit>  visualised in cytoscape in fig.  <dig>  the most interconnected ontological term is membrane and all the other processes are related to membrane events: these include cell adhesion, neuronal projections, synaptic functions and transmission of nerve impulse.table  <dig> go terms showing over-representation amongst genes differentially expressed in yac <dig> compared with wt striata

comparison with human hd and other mouse models
a straightforward examination of the overlap between the yac <dig> and hdhq <dig> fdr controlled lists of differentially expressed genes shows that more genes are common to the two lists than might be expected . however this only examines a very small part of each genelist and the relationship of alterations in gene expression extends over a much more substantial proportion of the genes surveyed: in addition the simple analysis above does not take direction of change in gene expression into account. it is also hard to compare across species and gene expression platforms. to gain a more detailed understanding of the relationship between the striatal gene expression changes between the yac <dig>  human brain and other mouse model striata we examined the overlap by direction in ranked bins of the gene expression differences. the overlap between the top  <dig> probesets altered in abundance between the yac <dig> striata and human caudate is substantial )  <cit> . there is also a significant overlap with human cerebellum , human ba <dig> cortex  and ba <dig> cortex . the yac <dig> striatal genes altered in abundance overlapped significantly with those seen in the hdhq <dig> striata  and also r6/ <dig>  and r6/ <dig> whole brain   <cit> . the direction of these changes is also largely concordant . conducting the comparison at the individual time-points reveals that the substantial overlap between the expression profile of these tissues is already significant at 6 months and becomes increasingly significant over time . a direct comparison of the yac <dig> and hdhq <dig> gene expression profiles at the time points for which gene expression data are available shows that concordance and overlap increase over time although they are already substantial by 6 months . to ensure that the overlaps observed were not just a result of non-specific striatal pathology, we compared the yac <dig> gene expression data in this study to that from a study of mptp effects on gene expression which also generated gene expression profiles in mouse striatal tissue  <cit> . we detected no significant overlap of genes differentially expressed between the two studies .fig.  <dig> correlation of direction of expression changes in yac <dig> striata, other mouse models of hd and human hd caudate. a shows the overlap of genes within the fdr adjusteddifferentially expressed genes from the yac <dig> compared with the hdhq <dig> mouse striata. in b and c frequency  represents the fraction of the top  <dig> hdhq <dig> expression changes that map to a particular bin of ranked data  in the other dataset, which is then split to concordant or discordant direction of expression change. a higher frequency of concordant  rather than discordant  in the first bins indicates a similarity between the yac <dig> caudate and other model or human hd gene expression signature. b shows the comparison of yac <dig> striatal gene expression with human hd brain regions  <cit>  and the comparison with other mouse models and c shows the comparison at the same time points with the hdhq <dig> striatal gene expression.



despite the substantial overlap in gene expression profiles, there are genes whose variation in expression differs between the two models. differences between genotype and model were assessed using anova. this was done by fitting a regression model containing the main effects of genotype and model, together with their interaction term. a significant  interaction term was taken as evidence of a difference in gene expression between models. there were  <dig> probesets with a significant interaction term  . examination of enrichment does not reveal any significant functional pathways identified by these genes, but the most significant individual gene is htt itself.table  <dig> genes that show significantly different patterns of differential expression between yac <dig> and hdhq <dig> striata

comparison of inclusion prevalence between mouse models
to assess whether the gene expression changes correlated with htt-specific inclusions in the yac <dig> and hdhq <dig> mouse models we examined mutant htt and ubiquitin distribution in mouse brain using immunohistochemistry . all regions of the hdhq <dig> mouse brain showed widespread s <dig> mutant htt positive inclusions . in contrast the yac <dig> mouse brain at 18 months showed few frank inclusions , though there is nuclear filling in all regions and a few small inclusions in the hippocampus. the htt in the q <dig> mice is entirely mouse and all mutant, whereas yac128s have human mutant htt and endogenous mouse htt. in order to ascertain that the s <dig> was detecting similar inclusions we also assessed inclusion load using anti-ubiquitin . the anti-ubiquitin antibody also detects the inclusions in the q <dig> mouse brain, though they are less frequent than the s <dig> positive inclusions, showing that the inclusions shown by the hdhq <dig> brain are not a direct result of the relevant mutant htt epitope only being available to the s <dig> antibody in the hdhq <dig> but not the yac <dig> brains.fig.  <dig> comparative mutant htt pathology in the hdhq <dig>  and yac <dig>   mouse brain. comparative immunohistochemistry in brains from 18 month old yac <dig> or hdhq <dig> mice using either the mutant htt specific antibody s <dig> or the anti-ubiquitin at 100x magnification



discussion
the data demonstrate that the gene expression changes in the yac <dig> mouse striata are similar to those in the hdhq <dig> striata at all ages  <cit> . these results are directly comparable as samples from mice of the same age were arrayed on the same chip. the similarity increases with age which is most likely to indicate a convergent gene expression phenotype in the striata of these models as the effects of the mutation become more marked and overcome differences between the models. it also demonstrates that the trajectory of molecular changes in the striata of these two differently constructed model lines parallel each other very well, despite differences apparent in the onset of their phenotypic changes  <cit> .

the similarities in rna changes are also paralleled in the human hd brain, especially in the caudate  <cit> . it is unsurprising that the human caudate gene expression profile should more closely parallel that of the mouse striatum than those of the human cortex or cerebellum, as the mouse caudate is contained within the striatal tissue analysed. these data therefore indicate that the gene expression profiles of these two mouse models of hd are convergent over time, and this is reinforced by comparisons with other models and with human caudate.

one major difference between these two models of hd is in the development of htt-positive inclusions  <cit> . the yac <dig> model develops frank nuclear inclusions in the brain relatively late, from 15 months of age onwards, whereas the hdhq <dig> model has such inclusions present from 5 months of age. the reason for this difference is not understood, though it is possible that the human and mouse proteins show differences in reactivity to the s <dig> antibody: however, the ubiquitin immunohistochemistry also shows that intranuclear inclusions are present in the hdhq <dig> but not the yac <dig> mouse brain at 5 months. fewer ubiquitin-positive inclusions are observed than s <dig> positive inclusions which is consistent with previous data indicating that ubiquitin positive staining is a later event than mutant-htt positive staining of inclusions in mouse brain  <cit> . however, the trajectory of nuclear filling with mhtt immunoreactivity followed by inclusion formation is common to both models and thus it seems most likely that this is a true difference in mhtt aggregation in these models. the concentrations of mhtt present in the yac <dig> brain are probably similar to that in the hdhq <dig> model as we noted reduced expression of mhtt in the hdhq <dig> model such that it probably only expresses around half the wt endogenous level in brain  <cit> . however, the presence of normal mouse htt might inhibit inclusion formation. if endogenous mouse htt is recruited into the inclusions then the presence of heterozygous protein differences is known to slow aggregation of the cognate proteins in other neurodegenerative diseases where protein inclusions are present in the disease, for instance in prion-related disease  <cit> . while we have noted there are strong similarities in the striatal gene expression changes between these models, there are also differences, although the differences do not highlight any specific functional pathways: nevertheless these differences might contribute to the difference in inclusions observed. discordant inclusion formation and pathogenic effects have been noted previously in a number of different systems  <cit>  though the connection with similar gene expression profiles in the face of differential inclusion formation has not been made previously.

the significant differences between the gene expression profiles of the striata from the yac <dig> and hdhq <dig> lines do not highlight any obvious functional differences between the two models that could account for the observed differences in inclusion prevalence. grk <dig> is close to the htt locus in mice but it is not contained within the yac construct used to generate these mice  <cit> : thus this cannot explain the increased expression of this gene. other than this the significantly altered genes are not in the same chromosomal locations, so no chromosomally specific effect can be inferred that is due to the direct action of the transgene. the gene most significantly altered in expression is htt itself and this is expected in light of the substantial down-regulation of mhtt in the hdhq <dig> homozygous knock in striata  <cit> .

most of the genes that are differentially expressed between the models show increased expression in yac <dig> striata and it is possible that this is due to the increased expression of htt itself over the endogenous htt expression. mutant htt can rescue the lethal effects of knocking out wt htt  <cit>  so the mutant protein may well be exerting functional effects in relation to its normal as well as its pathological function. the expression of the yac transgene in the yac <dig> animals is close to the level of expression of the endogenous mouse gene  <cit> . the differential changes could potentially be related to the normal function of htt through the effects of increased overall huntingtin expression and thus enhancement of the normal function. the gain in weight of the yac <dig> animals over time compared with most hd mouse models has been suggested to be the result of the third copy of htt and higher huntingtin expression  <cit> . there is, however, no overlap with the genes found to be altered in htt null cell lines  <cit> , although this could be the result of the very different biological systems studied and the different chips used.

htr2a is expressed more highly in the yac <dig> than the hdhq <dig> striata. htr2a in humans is the major serotonin receptor in the brain and is a target of the ssri citalopram, which downregulates its expression . the potentially depressive-like symptoms noted in the yac <dig> animals  <cit>  might therefore relate to alterations in the expression of this receptor. the deficits in the forced swim test in the yac <dig> mice are thought to be a surrogate test for a syndrome related to depression in mice and this alteration in gene expression might underlie this observation. the ssri fluoxetine did not improve performance in the forced swim task in yac <dig> mice, but this test is confounded in these mice by the motor deficit and it is not clear that fluoxetine has the same effects on htr2a as citalopram. in addition, the improvement in symptoms seen in mice treated with ssris is thought to be mediated by bdnf levels: it is possible that these are so compromised in the yac <dig> mice that the drugs are incapable of improving them although levels of bdnf rna measured in the striata are unchanged in the cohort of animals that we used. however, given the prevalence of depressive symptoms in hd patients  this may shed light on their mechanism.

the differences in gene expression with age in these animals is not the same as for the hdhq <dig> animals. there are fewer changes and they do not highlight as many pathways, or the same pathways, as in the hdhq <dig> mouse striata, especially between  <dig> and 12 months  <cit> . between  <dig> and 18 months more pathways are highlighted some of which relate to perception of smell and neurological processes and notably genes for the perception of smell were enriched between  <dig> and 12 months in the hdhq <dig> cohorts. it is not clear why these differences exist, and it must be remembered that these are not true longitudinal data  but rather pseudo-longitudinal: the animals are maintained in the same way and are on the same genetic background but are different animals at the different time points. there may be subtle differences in the housing over time that have contributed to these differences in striatal gene expression profiles with age.

examining the effects of genotype with age using tanova shows that genes that are down-regulated in the wt animal striata with age are also down-regulated in the q <dig> knock in homozygote striata. this may indicate that the processes underlying the down-regulation of gene expression in hd model striata are related to those in normal ageing. the genes highlight a number of differentially regulated pathways including those involved in g-protein mediated signal transduction and homeostasis, although there is no direct overlap with the enriched pathways seen in the q <dig> striata, despite the strong concordant overlap in the expression of individual genes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the related pathways of cell adhesion, neuronal projections, synaptic functions and transmission of nerve impulse seen in the david analysis for enriched pathways indicates that the maintainance and regulation of connections between neurons is central to the molecular pathogenesis in yac <dig> striatum.

the similarities in striatal gene expression differences between this hd model and human caudate and with other mouse models indicate that similar molecular processes are probably occurring. these appear to occur despite differences in inclusion formation. this indicates that the presence of htt-positive inclusions is not necessary for these changes to occur. this separation of inclusion formation from the molecular consequences of the htt mutation is worthy of further investigation as many studies in in vitro systems use inclusion formation as a measurable end-point to assess the effects of potential therapeutics.
