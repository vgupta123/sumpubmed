BACKGROUND
maize originates from the highlands of central and south america’s tropical and subtropical regions and is adapted to warm temperatures  <cit> . although climatic factors, such as light, temperature, water, and co <dig> in air, all have significant influences on maize production, temperature is still the major factor affecting maize growth and development  <cit> . in recent years, with the increasing and frequent occurrence of extremely high temperatures due to global warming, high temperature has become one of the most important abiotic stresses restricting crop production worldwide  <cit> . heat stress affects maize flowering, pollination, and grain filling, which then results in the decline of seed setting rate and thus reduces maize production  <cit> . therefore, the adverse effect of high temperatures on maize production is increasingly becoming a concern.

maize seedlings grown under high temperatures for long durations will have thin leaf morphology, and their leaf colors gradually change from green to light green, and eventually become yellow. heat stress can cause the reductions in leaf extension rate, shoot biomass, and co <dig> assimilation rate  <cit> . high temperature during the flowering stage can lead to reduced pollen quality, low yield, and poor quality of the final products  <cit> . further research shows that heat stress can affect grain crude protein, crude fat, and lysine contents, which in turn leads to the low quality of maize products  <cit> . in addition, heat-resistant maize variety maintains higher levels of chlorophyll content, photosystem ii electron transfer rate, photosynthetic rate, and other important physical characteristics under heat stress  <cit> .

the molecular mechanisms underlying plant heat tolerance including the alteration of signaling cascades and transcriptional control, increasing production of antioxidants  <cit>  and osmoprotectants, and the expression of heat shock proteins  <cit> , have been presented. heat shock proteins  are a type of proteins with highly conserved amino acid sequences and functions. hsps function as molecular chaperones and are involved in repairing and refolding damaged proteins as well as synthesizing, folding and transporting normal proteins  <cit> . extensive studies have demonstrated the notable protection of hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and smhsps family proteins from heat stress.

transcriptomics is a powerful tool for discovering differentially expressed genes and has been widely applied in some crop species, including rice , maize  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , barley  <cit> , cotton  <cit> , rape  <cit> , potato  <cit> , tea  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , pepper  <cit> , watermelon  <cit> , phaseolus vulgaris  <cit> , vigna mungo  <cit> , pea  <cit> , chickpea  <cit>  and citrus fruit  <cit> . among them, the transcriptome profiling of rice  <cit> , barley  <cit> , pepper  <cit>  and maize  <cit>  in response to heat stress has been performed. however, comparative transcriptome analysis has only been performed in rice and pepper between heat-resistant and heat-sensitive cultivars. in this study, to detect the differential gene expression in different maize genotypes under heat stress, heat-resistant and heat-sensitive maize seedlings were treated at 42 °c, and the expression of genes in leaves collected at different time points was measured. a comparative transcriptomic analysis was performed to reveal the significantly up-regulated and down-regulated genes. gene ontology  classification of the proteins encoded by these genes was used to analyze their cellular locations. a pathway analysis was performed to reveal the biological pathways involving these genes. this study may provide a new insight into the transcriptional alterations in heat-resistant and heat-sensitive sweet maize varieties responding to heat stress.

discussion
high temperature is an adverse factor influencing both plant growth and development, thereby causing extensive loss of yield  <cit> . although the physiological effects of heat stress on crops has been extensively reported, the understanding of underlying molecular mechanism remains limited. in the present study, we found that most of proteins encoded by up-regulated genes were localized in chloroplast and its structural components, and involved in multiple biological processes associated with photosynthesis. obviously, they are closely related to function of chloroplast, especially photosynthesis, indicating that these chloroplast proteins play an important role in increasing heat tolerance in sweet maize. in contrast, the proteins encoded by  <dig>  down-regulated genes were localized in multiple cellular components, including cytoplasm, nuclear, non-membrane-bounded organelle, ribosome, vacuole, chloroplast and plasmodesma, and were involved in a series of biological processes from gene expression to translation, suggesting that lowering these processes may contribute to improved heat resistance in sweet maize.

here, we found there was an apparent connection between the heat tolerance of sweet corn and the alterations in  <dig> pathways, including the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, photosynthesis  and ribosome function , which was consistent with the results of previous studies  <cit> . apart from the above-mentioned pathways, the differences in  <dig> pathways including photosynthesis, photosynthesis-antenna proteins, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, diterpenoid biosynthesis, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, nitrogen metabolism, flavone and flavonol biosynthesis and monoterpenoid biosynthesis, were found between heat-tolerance and heat-sensitive sweet maize cultivars, which also appeared between heat-tolerance and heat-sensitive pepper ones  <cit> , indicating that they might be the most fundamental pathways involved in heat tolerance in other crop species.

interestingly, both up-regulated and down-regulated genes have been identified to be involved in  <dig> identical pathways including biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome p <dig> and drug metabolism- cytochrome p <dig>  indicating that genes involved in these pathways showed patterns of both upregulating and downregulating expression, which was likely to help keep these pathways in balance under heat stress.

previous studies showed that  <dig> hormones including aba, auxin, jasmonic acid , cytokinins , ethylene, gibberellin, and brassinosteroid were likely to be involved in heat stress  <cit> . interestingly, several hormones including aba, brassinosteroids , and ethylene possibly interacted through complex networks to regulate heat stress responses  <cit> . in the present study, we found that some genes related to two plant hormone signal pathways including zeatin biosynthesis and brassinosteroid biosynthesis had lower levels in xt  than in zf , indicating that reduced biosynthesis of zeatin and brassinosteroid was likely to be related to heat tolerance in sweet maize. accumulating evidences also demonstrated that changes in zeatin content were related to plant heat tolerance. in creeping bentgrass, the levels of various cytokinins, zeatin , zeatin riboside , dihydrogen zeatin riboside  and isopentinyl adenosine , showed dramatic decline in root and shoot under high soil temperature, which were correlated with decreased dry matter production  <cit> . in a dwarf wheat variety, high-temperature-induced decrease in cytokinin content was responsible for reduced kernel filling and its dry weight  <cit> . however, brassinosteroids conferred the basic thermotolerance to tomato and oilseed rape , but not to cereals  <cit> . therefore, it was suggested that heat-tolerant sweet maize might keep at lower growth level than heat-sensitive one through dowregulating expression of genes related to zeatin and brassinosteroid biosynthesis to better regulate heat stress responses.

CONCLUSIONS
comparative transcriptome analsis revealed  <dig> commonly up-regulated and  <dig>  commonly down-regulated genes between heat tolerant and heat sensitive sweet maize genotypes under heat stress. gene ontology classification and kegg pathway analysis of these differentially expressed genes showed that secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathway and ribosome were the most significant ones. further analysis revealed that  <dig> fundamental pathways,  <dig> identical pathways and  <dig> hormonal signal pathways  were likely to play important roles in regulating the response of maize to heat stress. therefore, our results provide a new insight into transcriptional alterations in heat-resistant and heat-sensitive sweet maize varieties under heat stress, which helps to address underlying molecular mechanism of maize in response to heat stress.
