BACKGROUND
cellular prion protein  is a ubiquitous glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol  anchored glycoprotein that has gained enormous attention as the central factor in prion diseases  <cit> . in these diseases prpc is converted through conformational change to a pathological form  that self-replicates using prpc as the substrate. the normal functions of prpc remain elusive despite concerted efforts. prpc has been implicated in cns development, neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival, early synaptic neuronal transmission and reorganization of neuronal circuitry within the hippocampus, regulation of circadian rhythm, memory formation and cognition, maintenance of ca2+-activated k+ currents of hippocampal ca <dig> pyramidal neurons, protection against brain injury in rat and mouse models of ischemic stroke, and in t cell development and function  <cit> . over-expression of prpc has been shown to exert a protective effect in bax and tnfα-mediated cell death and conversely a pro-apoptotic function in studies of staurosporine-induced cell death  <cit> . it has also been demonstrated that depletion of endogenous prp reduces susceptibility to staurosporine-induced caspase  <dig> and p <dig> activation  <cit> .

in a previous study we generated transgenic mice, tg, that express human prpc exclusively in the skeletal muscles under tight regulation by doxycycline  <cit> . we found that induced over-expression of prpc in the muscles leads to a progressive primary myopathy characterized by increased variation of myofiber size, centrally located nuclei and endomysial fibrosis, in the absence of cytoplasmic inclusions, rimmed vacuoles, or any evidence of a neurogenic disorder  <cit> . while the pathogenic mechanism of the prp-mediated myopathy was not determined, an interesting observation was that the myopathy was accompanied by preferential accumulation of an n-terminal-truncated prpc fragment, which was confirmed to be the c <dig> fragment  <cit>  resulting from normal prpc processing  <cit> . the c <dig> fragment is also found in the skeletal muscles of wild-type mouse, but at a much lower level and a molar ratio of close to 1: <dig> over full-length prpc, in contrast to a ratio of 3: <dig> in the dox-induced tg model  <cit> .

a number of studies have shown the expression of n-terminus truncated forms of prpc to be associated with toxicity in animal models  <cit> . the protein doppel, which is homologous to the c-terminus of prp, has also been shown to be cytotoxic when ectopically expressed in neurons  <cit> . in both cases, the toxicity can be abrogated by the co-expression of full length prpc  <cit> . the c <dig> fragment has also been reported to potentiate staurosporine-induced toxicity via caspase  <dig> activation in cultured cells  <cit> , but this toxic effect is similar to what was reported for full-length prpc  <cit> . we hypothesize that the high levels of the c <dig> fragment that accumulate in dox-treated tg mice is largely responsible for the toxic effect that leads to the development of myopathy in these mice. in order to understand the molecular mechanism that underlies this prp toxicity, we have performed microarray analysis to determine gene regulatory networks that are triggered following overexpression of prpc in the skeletal muscles of tg mice.

methods
animals and treatment
the doxycycline-inducible tg mice were described previously  <cit> . the hqk transgene contained two genes: reverse tetracycline responsive transcription activator  under the control of the mouse prp promoter of the half genomic prp clone, and human prp orf regulated by the tetracycline-responsive promoter  from the core plasmid  <cit> . the tg mice were generated in the fvb background, and tg/prnpo/o mice were obtained through breeding with the zurich i prp-null mice  <cit>  in fvb background. line tg <dig>  referred to as tg for simplicity, was used for this study.

animal treatment and specimen collection
wild type , prp-null , and tg mice were fed food pellets either lacking or containing  <dig> g doxycycline /kg food  to induce prpc expression. skeletal muscles from the quadriceps of hind legs were removed at day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days following administration of dox. for immunoblot and microarray analysis, the muscle tissues were immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80°c.

rna isolation
total rna was isolated from frozen skeletal muscle using the rneasy skeletal muscle rna isolation kit  following the manufacturer's specifications. the total rna preparations were further treated with turbo dna-free dnase  to remove residual genomic dna contamination, and examined with a bioanalyzer  <dig>  for purity and quantity.

rna amplification and labeling for microarray analysis
total rna was amplified and labeled for microarray analysis using the aminoallyl message amp ii arna amplification kit  following the manufacturer's specifications. in brief,  <dig> μg total rna was reverse transcribed to first-strand cdna, followed by subsequent second-strand cdna synthesis. in vitro transcription to synthesize amplified arna was performed and the resultant arna quantified. ten to fifteen micrograms of arna was designated as reference  or experimental , and then coupled to either alexa fluor succinimidyl ester  <dig> or alexa fluor succinimidyl ester  <dig> dye in 30% dmso/coupling buffer in the dark at room temperature for  <dig> hour. each sample was labeled individually with both alexa fluor  <dig> and  <dig> for subsequent dye-swapped hybridizations to account for intensity bias. uncoupled dyes were removed and labeled arna purified following the manufacturer's specifications.

cdna microarrays
a total of  <dig>  cdna expressed sequence tags from the brain molecular anatomy project  mouse brain library  were spotted in duplicate onto cmt-gaps gamma amino propyl silane coated glass slides  using the virtek chip writer. five micrograms of both reference  and experimental  alexa flour labeled arna were used in each competitive hybridization. each labeled arna was resuspended in  <dig> μl dig easy hyb™ hybridization buffer  containing  <dig> μg mouse cot <dig> dna and  <dig> μg poly-dna to block non-specific hybridization. three biological replicate samples from each of the reference and experimental groups were combined, heated for  <dig> minutes at 95°c, then cooled and maintained at 42°c. the labeled arna sample mixtures were added to a bmap microarray and incubated in the dark at 42°c overnight to competitively hybridize to reference and experimental samples. the number of slides hybridized in each experiment corresponded to the number of biological replicates in each group of experimental interest. following hybridization, the slides were washed once in low stringency wash buffer  preheated to 42°c for  <dig> minutes, once in high stringency wash buffer  for  <dig> minutes at room temperature, and then once in  <dig> × ssc for  <dig> minutes at room temperature. the slides were analyzed in two channels using the agilent ht microarray scanner . raw, background and net intensity values were collected using array-pro software . in order to account for variation in fluorescence, lowess sub-grid normalization was performed by gene traffic software , and the subsequent normalized log <dig> ratios obtained. the resulting ratio between reference and experimental signals for each individual gene was used as a measure of differential gene expression using edge , an open source software program for the significance analysis of dna microarray experiments .

edge implements statistical methodology specifically designed for time course experiments  <cit> . a significance measure is assigned to each gene via the q value  methodology  <cit> . we selected a q-value cutoff to display the genes that met our significance threshold. we performed a "between class" analysis of the data over time; the class variables, or biological groups, were the prp over-expressing mice  and the prp-ko mice.

agilent whole mouse genome oligonucleotide microarrays
one microgram of each alexa fluor  <dig> and  <dig> labeled samples as prepared above were fragmented, reference and experimental samples together, in  <dig> μl fragmentation mix in preparation for hybridization to agilent's whole mouse genome  <dig> k oligonucleotide microarrays. following the manufacturer's protocol, an equal volume of 2× hybridization buffer was added to stop arna fragmentation and prepare the samples for hybridization. four hundred fifty microliters of each mixture containing the reference and experimental samples was then added to an individual slide hybridization assembly and allowed to rotate at  <dig> rpm at 65°c for  <dig> hours. slides were washed and scanned as recommended in the protocol, then analyzed using agilent feature extraction software. raw, background and net intensity values were collected. a linear and lowess normalization correction method was selected in order to account for variations in fluorescence. a two-sided t-test of feature versus background, set at a p value of  <dig> , was used to obtain a list of genes whose log <dig> ratios were significant.

validation of gene expression using quantitative pcr
some of the genes that appeared to be differentially regulated were confirmed with quantitative real-time pcr , using probe specific taqman gene expression assays on the applied biosystems  <dig> fast real-time pcr system.  <dig> ng of total rna previously isolated and used for microarray analysis was reverse transcribed using the high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit. subsequently,  <dig> μl from each reverse transcription reaction was assayed in a  <dig> μl single-plex reaction for real-time quantification with the  <dig> fast pcr system using probes specific to those genes of interest. each sample was run in biological triplicate, of which  <dig> technical replicates were performed. gapdh was used as the endogenous control, and gene expression of target genes for ko and hqk samples were quantitatively measured relative to the wt samples. relative quantification values were determined using the 2-ΔΔct method, and expressed as fold-change over wt.

immunoblot analysis
mouse skeletal muscle tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer containing  <dig> mm tris ,  <dig> mm sodium chloride,  <dig> % sodium deoxicholate, and  <dig> mm edta. protein concentrations were determined by the bca protein assay . after addition of lds sample buffer  and sample reducing agents , the homogenates were denatured at 100°c for  <dig> minutes, and the proteins were resolved on 10% nupage tris-bis gels  and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes . for p <dig> protein detection, the membrane was incubated with a monoclonal anti-p <dig> antibody that detects total p <dig> proteins   at 4°c with gentle shaking overnight. for mef2c detection, the membrane was incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-mef2c antibody   at 4°c with gentle shaking overnight. the blots were developed with the immobilon western chemiluminescent hrp substrate  according to the manufacturer's instructions. skeletal muscle actin was probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody   similarly after stripping the blots with a stripping buffer containing  <dig> % 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% sds and  <dig>  mm tris . the western blots were scanned and the protein bands were quantified with the un-scan-it gel  <dig>  software .

RESULTS
induction of prpc specifically in the skeletal muscle of transgenic mice results in a temporally regulated transcriptional profile
the transgenic mice  used in this study have been described previously, in which prpc is exclusively expressed in skeletal muscles under the strict control of doxycycline  and the induced over-expression of prpc leads to a progressive primary myopathy  <cit> . to determine the temporal patterns of gene expression that accompany the induced myopathy, we carried out microarray analysis of skeletal muscles from tg mice, wild-type fvb mice  and prp-knockout control mice  using a  <dig> -gene cdna array constructed in our laboratory. skeletal muscles from the hind legs  of the mice were collected at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days following administration of dox. three animals were taken at each time point for each of the three mouse lines . temporally regulated genes in the quadriceps of tg and ko, in comparison to wt, were identified using edge , a significance method for analyzing time course microarray data  <cit> . a q value cut-off of  <dig> , and a fold change of  <dig> for at least one time-point, was the criteria used for the selection of differentially expressed genes. in the muscles of dox-treated tg mice,  <dig> differentially expressed genes were identified in comparison with similarly treated, age-matched wt mice; a cluster plot of all differentially expressed genes based on similarities in their expression profiles is shown in figure 1a. in contrast, only  <dig> genes showed significant differential expression in the muscles of ko mice in comparison with similarly treated, age-matched wt mice. to verify the expression of genes identified on our cdna array, and to sample a more complete set of genes covering the whole mouse genome, we purchased additional microarrays from agilent technologies. these arrays consisted of  <dig>  oligonucleotide probes representing the whole mouse genome. we re-examined the day  <dig> samples since the majority of the  <dig> temporally deregulated genes showed differential expression at this time point. a two-sided t-test of feature versus background, set at a p value of  <dig> , was used to obtain a list of genes whose log <dig> ratios were significant. this list was in good agreement with the data from our in-house manufactured cdna array, confirming the deregulation of almost two-thirds of genes originally identified by the cdna array, in addition a set of genes which were not represented by probes on our in-house cdna arrays were identified. in total,  <dig> selected genes were annotated in the ingenuity pathway analysis  database and are provided as additional file  <dig>  and additional file  <dig> . a summary of the most common biological functions and toxicity-related pathways associated with these genes is shown in figure 1b. gene ontology analysis revealed that up-regulated genes were particularly enriched for genes involved in development, cell cycle regulation, programmed cell death, lipid metabolism and ion homeostasis . down-regulated gene ontology categories were enriched for genes involved in cellular energy metabolism, particularly carboxylic acid metabolism, protein metabolism and muscle developmental processes .

prpc over-expression regulates multiple targets with established roles in myopathy
many of the gene expression changes identified in the tg muscle are consistent with the observed progressive atrophy, which is characterized by a decrease in myofiber size and total muscle mass accompanied by a concomitant accumulation of lysosomes. specific changes included a significant down-regulation of genes coding for the myofibrillar proteins myh <dig>  myh <dig>  myh <dig>  myl <dig>  myl <dig>  and an increase in expression of the transcription regulator mdfi  that acts as a negative regulator of myogenic proteins, and induction of myog , a muscle-specific transcription factor that can induce myogenesis in a variety of cell types in tissue culture. the mef2c  gene was also down-regulated in dox-induced tg muscles. immunoblot analysis showed that there was statistically significant reduction of mef2c protein level in the skeletal muscle from day  <dig> of dox treatment, and the reduction reached 50% after  <dig> days of dox treatment . mef2c has been studied extensively in muscle cells. it is a key regulatory transcriptional factor that plays an essential role in the transcriptional control of muscle development as well as remodeling of adult muscles in response to physiologic and pathologic signals  <cit> . it has been reported that mef2c directly activates the expression of a muscle specific protein kinase srpk <dig> and srpk3-null mice exhibit widespread centronuclear myopathy via an unknown mechanism  <cit> . we speculate that the down-regulated mef2c gene expression might play a role in the progressive central nucleus localization observed in the skeletal muscles of dox-treated tg mice  <cit>  through a reduction of the srpk <dig> activity.

a number of lysosomal peptidases were up-regulated including ctss, ctsd, ctsz, and dpep <dig>  coincident with an observed accumulation of lysosomes in tg mice over-expressing prpc  <cit> . the gene ctsl, which codes for a lysosomal cysteine proteinase, is commonly used as a universal marker for muscle atrophy but was not represented on our arrays  <cit> . qrt-pcr revealed expression of this gene was induced transiently following prpc induction, peaking at  <dig> days following the onset of dox treatment and returning to the baseline by  <dig> days post-induction. the genes encoding lysosomal proteins hexa, hexb and lamp <dig> were also up-regulated at late time points.

previous studies have shown that the development of muscle atrophy in a number of models of systemic wasting states  and in disuse atrophy induced by denervation or spinal cord isolation follows a common program of transcriptional changes  <cit> . one of the main features of this program is a general increase in expression of genes involved in proteolysis including both lysosomal proteases, and an atp-dependent process requiring ubiquitin and the proteasome. the degradation of prpc and prpsc is also believed to involve the proteasome  <cit> , and compromised/inhibited proteasome activity was proposed to lead to accumulation of cytosolic prpc that is neurotoxic  <cit> ; but the latter notion has been challenged  <cit> . following induction of prpc we observed that the expression levels of genes involved in proteasomal protein degradation were for the most part unchanged. out of the  <dig> unique proteasome related genes represented on the microarrays, only three  were up-regulated and four  were down-regulated.

a further feature reported in a number of different models of diseases resulting in muscle atrophy is the substantial up-regulation of two e <dig> ubiquitin ligases, atrogin-1/mafbx  and murf <dig>   <cit> , which are generally induced early during the atrophy process. upon fasting, the rise in atrogin- <dig> expression precedes the loss of muscle weight; conversely, deletion of either atrogin- <dig> or murf <dig> has been shown to significantly alleviate muscle atrophy  <cit> . our microarray data did not reveal a significant increase in atrogin- <dig> expression in the tg atrophy model and no probe for murf- <dig> was present on either of our array platforms. qrt-pcr was used to determine the expression levels of these two genes, and a small, less than 3-fold increase in the expression of both murf <dig> and atrogin- <dig> was detected following induction of prpc ; this is much lower than the 10– <dig> fold increase generally found in other models of muscle atrophy. in a recent study, the induction of the foxo <dig> protein  as well as the fall in pgc- <dig> alpha and beta  were identified in numerous types of muscle wasting  <cit> . a 3-fold decrease of foxo <dig> and no change in expression of pgc- <dig> alpha and beta were detected in dox-treated tg mice. these data suggest only minor involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolysis pathway in the observed muscle atrophy and a program of transcriptional changes that is not reminiscent of systemic wasting states.

activation of p53-mediated signaling pathways following prpc induction in skeletal muscle of tg
the dramatic transcriptional response to prpc over-expression in the muscles of tg mice lacks key features of the common transcriptional program indicative of several reported forms of muscle atrophy. this includes striking de-regulation of over  <dig> genes involved in cell death and regulation of the cell cycle, which suggests a toxic effect of the over-expressed prp. using the ingenuity pathway analysis  tool, we identified many pathways invoked in response to prpc over-expression, among which the p <dig> signaling pathway scored highly with a p value of  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  other molecular pathways that scored significantly were the related g1/s transition of the cell cycle , mitochondrial dysfunction  and oxidative stress response  .

the involvement of the p <dig> signaling pathways was of particular interest as mounting evidence suggests that over-expression of prpc sensitizes cells to apoptotic stimuli through a p53-dependent pathway  <cit> . the p <dig> gene itself did not meet our selection criteria  as significantly deregulated in the microarray analysis; however qrt-pcr showed it to be marginally up-regulated from day  <dig> following the onset of prpc induction. this transient over-expression was low, approximately  <dig> – <dig>  fold, but statistically significant in all tg mice tested . however, regulation of p <dig> is known to take place mostly at the level of translation  <cit> . in accordance with this, immunoblot analysis of the levels of total p <dig> protein in the skeletal muscle  of tg mice, shown in figure 5a and 5b, revealed a moderate but significant accumulation of p <dig> protein beginning at day  <dig> following the commencement of doxycycline treatment and rising to over 3-fold over age-matched wt controls 30– <dig> days post dox induction. activation of p <dig> is kept in check by its negative regulator mdm <dig>  in a negative feedback regulatory loop since activated p <dig> induces expression of mdm <dig>  <cit> . we found that the levels of mdm <dig> were only marginally changed at early time points but were significantly up-regulated at the later time points , congruent with the accumulation of p <dig> protein . the moderate increase in p <dig> in the muscles of dox-treated tg mice is consistent with the observed gradual and progressive muscle wasting.

deregulation of genes involved in p53-dependent g <dig> cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
systematic examination of the genes differentially expressed following prpc over expression revealed over  <dig> genes that were annotated, or cited in pubmed, as being p <dig> responsive genes. we used the ipa tool to build a network of potential regulatory interactions between the products of these genes; the resulting network is shown in figure  <dig>  the genes making up this network are primarily involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and cell death. a number of these are transcription factors including the proinflammatory regulator nf-κb which has been shown to be activated in degenerating muscle of duchenne muscular dystrophy patients and dystrophin-difficient mouse models  <cit> . two products of up-regulated genes induced in tg muscle, cdnk1a  and gadd45b , stand out as crucial to the initiation of cell cycle arrest mediated by activated p <dig>  p <dig> tightly controls the expression of cdnk1a, which mediates the p53-dependent cell cycle arrest at the g <dig> phase by binding to and inhibiting the activity of cyclin-cdk <dig> or cyclin-cdk <dig> complexes in response to a variety of stress stimuli. expression of cdnk1a was confirmed by qrt-pcr to be increased by more than 20-fold over that in control wt mice at  <dig> days post induction. the up-regulation of gadd45a, closely related in function to gadd45b, was also confirmed by qrt-pcr. these genes are often coordinately expressed and can function cooperatively to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis. other up-regulated genes known to play a role in cell-cycle arrest are rb <dig>  which binds to e2f transcription factors to prevent transcription of genes required for the g <dig> to s phase transition, and cgref <dig>  which is produced in response to stress and serves as a negative regulator of the cell cycle  <cit> . taken together these gene expression changes indicate p53-dependent g <dig> cell cycle arrest was induced in tg muscle following induction of prpc expression.

following cell cycle arrest, cells either recover or undergo p53-mediated apoptosis due to transcriptional activation of a number of pro-apoptotic genes. key transducers of apoptosis include pmaip <dig>   <cit>  and bbc <dig>   <cit> . both were significantly up-regulated based on our microarray analysis. pmaip <dig> induces the expression of other death effectors including bak <dig>  <cit> , which was also significantly induced in dox-treated tg muscles. deregulation of other apoptosis effector genes includes induction of the pro-death genes boki and the down-regulation of mcl <dig>  a pro-survival bcl <dig> homologue. numerous studies have identified the pro-apoptotic regulator bax to be a major mediator of p <dig> induced apoptosis  <cit> . bax was not identified as up-regulated by our microarray analysis because of the high cut-off value , but qrt-pcr revealed a modest up-regulation of the bax gene  over time following prp over-expression. similar to p <dig>  tp73l  can mediate apoptosis and was also found to be induced in atrophic muscles of tg mice. less is known about the regulatory pathways triggered by p <dig> and its transcriptional targets have not been fully characterized  <cit> . moreover, both the p <dig> apoptosis effector gene perp and the p53-inducible ubiquitin ligase p53rfp  were significantly induced in the tg muscles as well. perp is a potential marker of p <dig> driven apoptosis since it has been found to be induced in p53-driven apoptotic cells but not in p53-dependent g <dig> arrested cells and p53rfp has also been shown to be involved in switching a cell from p53-mediated growth arrest to apoptosis  <cit> .

these data indicate that not only do muscle cells of dox-treated tg mice undergo p53-dependent cell cycle arrest, but at least in some instances they go on to undergo apoptosis, which strongly suggests that p53-regulated pro-apoptotic pathways play an important role in prp-mediated myopathy.

discussion
we have previously described the generation of the tg transgenic mice, in which dox-induced over-expression of prpc specifically in the skeletal muscles causes a primary myopathy that is correlated with accumulation of an n-terminal truncated prp c <dig> fragment  <cit> . the aim of this study was to determine the molecular basis for the prp-mediated myopathy by microarray analysis. the ultimate goals are to fully understand the detailed molecular pathways of prp-mediated myopathy, so that we can better understand the role of prp in both normal and diseased muscles and provide some clues on the pathogenic mechanism of prion diseases. utilizing two dna microarrays, we identified more than  <dig> genes that were temporally deregulated in a specific and highly consistent manner following induction of prpc over-expression in the muscles of tg mice and the subsequent development of myopathy. the transcriptional profiles in the muscles of dox-treated tg mice strongly implicate toxicity-induced pro-apoptotic pathways in prp-mediated myopathy, and they are quite different from the changes previously described in systemic, disuse, and denervation muscle atrophy.

interestingly, the transcription factor mef2c was found to be down-regulated at both the mrna and protein levels in prpc-mediated myopathy. mef2c is expressed specifically in muscle and brain, where it is a target for signaling pathways involving calcium  <cit> . mef2c regulates the expression of a majority of muscle-specific genes, and interacts with members of the myod family of proteins to activate muscle differentiation  <cit> . calcium signaling was one of the pathways significantly induced in dox-treated tg mouse muscles as evidenced by a very small p value of  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  the prpc protein has itself been shown to play a role in ca2+ homeostasis  <cit>  and it is possible that over-expression of prpc results in perturbations in ca2+ signaling, which in turn modulates the activity and/or expression of mef2c. as calcium regulation has also been shown to be altered during prion-induced neurodegeneration, this finding potentially links the molecular changes occurring in tg myopathy to the pathobiology of prion diseases.

the most striking finding is the strong and statistically highly significant induction of a p53-regulated pro-apoptotic network in tg mouse muscles following induction of prpc. central to this network are induction of p <dig> protein expression and strong induction of genes responsible for arresting the cell cycle, as well as a number of p53-regulated pro-apoptotic  and anti-apoptotic  genes. p <dig> is a critical tumor suppressor and transcription factor, and it has been linked to cell death in the central nervous system in a number of disorders including most notably neurodegenerative disorders such as alzheimer's disease and prion diseases  <cit> . the expression of p <dig> protein has been found to rapidly increase in neurons in response to a range of insults including dna damage, oxidative stress, metabolic compromise, and cellular calcium overload. over-expression of prpc has been shown to enhance staurosporine-induced toxicity and activation of caspase- <dig> in the hek <dig> kidney cell line  <cit>  and increase sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli via p53-dependent pathways in tsm <dig> neuronal cell line  <cit> . conversely neurons devoid of prpc expression were reported to display lower responsiveness to staurosporine, also via p53-dependent pathways  <cit> .

one of the main pro-apoptotic effectors of p <dig> is bax, which plays a major role in regulating neuronal death in the brain in response to a number of stimuli  <cit> . the role of bax in prion-induced neurodegeneration is not well understood; both bax-dependent and bax-independent mechanisms appear to underlie the action of neurotoxic forms of prion proteins  <cit> . however, in the muscle of dox-treated tg mice, only a marginal increase in bax expression was observed whereas significant over-expression of other p <dig> regulated pro-apoptotic proteins, including bak <dig>  bbc <dig> and pmaip <dig>  and mcl <dig>  were detected, suggesting that prpc-mediated myopathy observed in this model may depend on bax-independent pathways that involve bak <dig>  bbc <dig>  pmaip <dig>  and mcl <dig> 

we propose a working model to explain the mechanism of prp-mediated myopathy . dox-induced over-expression of prpc in the muscles leads to accumulation of the n-terminal truncated prp c <dig> fragment, which in turn activates p <dig>  thereby inducing p53-regulated pro-apoptotic networks and myopathic changes.

prp accumulation has been observed in the skeletal muscles of patients with inclusion-body myositis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and neurogenic muscle atrophy, and we have previously reported that over-expression of wild type prp in the skeletal muscles is sufficient to cause myopathy in the tg mice , which suggest that muscular accumulation of prp may contribute to the pathogenesis of some human muscle diseases. our finding that p53-related pathways play a major role in the myopathy in tg mice suggests that p <dig> and p53-related pathways may also be critical to the pathology of some human muscle disease patients and p <dig> and p53-related pathways may serve as potential targets for therapeutics development against these muscle diseases.

as we have previously reported  <cit> , the preferential accumulation of the truncated prp c <dig> fragment, which is generated through endoproteolysis of prpc during normal protein processing in the brain  <cit>  and the muscle  <cit> , was closely correlated with myopathic changes in dox-treated tg mice. we hypothesize that it is this c <dig> fragment that is the toxic species in the tg model, which is supported by recent reports showing that over-expression of the c <dig> fragment increases cell death and caspase- <dig> activity through a p53-dependent mechanism  <cit> . truncation of prpc occurs between residues  <dig> and  <dig> within a region shown to play a pivotal role in its conformational transition to prpsc. so a better understanding of modulation of this cleavage event and the mechanism for the truncated prp fragments as mediators of a toxic cellular response may be very important in dissecting prion disease pathogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we used microarrays to determine the molecular mechanism that underlies the myopathy observed in prp over-expressing mice. the transcriptional changes induced in the dox-treated tg mice are quite different from the changes previously described in systemic diseases and disuse and denervation atrophy. significantly we found that the p <dig> protein and p53-regulated pro-apoptotic pathways are highly activated in the muscles of doxycycline-treated tg mice, correlating well with the observed myopathic changes. to our best knowledge, this is the first in vivo evidence that directly links p <dig> to a wild type prp-mediated disease. we hypothesize that it is the preferentially accumulated truncated c <dig> fragment in the muscles of doxycycline-treated tg mice that activates the p <dig> pathway, resulting in the primary myopathy. this is consistent with recent reports showing that over-expression of the c <dig> fragment increase cell death and caspase- <dig> activity through a p53-dependent mechanism in cell culture models.

dissecting how prp regulates the p <dig> pathways may help understand prp-mediated pathogenesis in both muscle diseases and prion diseases. neuronal loss, a salient feature of prion diseases, has been reported to be due to neuronal apoptosis in prion-affected humans and animals  <cit> . p <dig> has been shown to be a critical player in prp or prp fragments-mediated cytotoxicity in neurons  <cit> . therefore, our finding that p <dig> plays a major role in prp-mediated myopathy and our future follow-up studies on the detailed molecular mechanisms of how prp over-expression leads to p <dig> activation in the muscles, may also provide some clues on the molecular mechanism of prion pathogenesis in the brain.
