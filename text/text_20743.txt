BACKGROUND
primordial germ cells migrate to and colonize the mouse gonad, completing the process during embryonic day  <dig>   to e <dig>   <cit> . subsequent phenotypic sexual dimorphism is defined by the gonad and mice lacking sry located on the y chromosome follow a constitutive female pathway  <cit> , presumably instructed by a unique set of genes  <cit> . entrance of female germ cells into meiosis at e <dig>  is a defining event mediated by retinoid responsive genes  <cit> . a second major transition occurs perinatally when flattened granulosa cells surround individual germ cells to form primordial follicles  <cit> , forming a reservoir of eggs available for subsequent fertilization  <cit> . germ cells that fail to interact with the gonadal somatic cells, either by ectopic location  <cit>  or in the absence of a critical oocyte-specific transcription factor, figla  <cit> , do not survive.

figla , a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, was first defined in the coordinate regulation of three genes  encoding proteins that form the zona pellucida surrounding ovulated eggs  <cit> . figla transcripts are detected as early as e <dig>  in the embryonic gonad and persist in the adult ovary  <cit> . figla protein, however, is not detected until e <dig> based on sensitive gel mobility shift assays  <cit> . mice lacking figla have normal embryonic gonad development, but primordial follicles do not form at birth and germ cells are lost within days. female, but not male, mice are sterile  <cit> . these data suggested that figla plays critical roles in female germline and follicle development, but the full complement of downstream gene targets involved in these processes and when in development they become activated have not been defined

using cdna microarrays, we have compared the transcriptomes of normal and figla null ovaries at four developmental time points . these results have been complemented with sage  libraries derived from newborn ovaries to identify potential direct and indirect gene targets of figla in female gonad development.

RESULTS
microarray data analysis
to identify potential downstream gene targets of figla, total rna was obtained from normal and figla null gonads isolated from e <dig> , e <dig> , e <dig>  and newborn female mice. three independent biological samples obtained from each embryonic time point and four from newborn gonads were linearly amplified, labeled with cy <dig> and cy <dig> and hybridized to the national institute of aging  cdna microarray consists of ~22k features enriched for transcripts from newborn ovaries, pre- and peri-implantation embryos  <cit> . after washing, the average statistically significant intensities for each element were analyzed with gene spring gx software. features that varied more than 2-fold  between normal and figla null gonads were selected for further analysis.

the m  vs. a  scatter plots reflect the fold change of differentially expressed genes in figla null and normal ovaries on the y axis relative to their abundance on the x axis . thus, transcripts with low intensity ratios  indicate genes that are potentially up-regulated by figla and transcripts with high intensity ratios  represent genes that are potentially down-regulated by figla. as expected, no genes were differentially expressed at e <dig> , a point in development prior to the onset of figla expression. only a few differences were observed at e <dig>  and e <dig>  with  <dig> and  <dig> genes up-regulated ≥ 2-fold  in normal ovaries and  <dig> and  <dig> up-regulated in figla null ovaries, respectively . in marked contrast,  <dig> transcripts were ≥ 2-fold more abundant in normal and  <dig> were ≥ 2-fold more abundant in figla null newborn ovaries .

developmental hierarchical cluster analysis of figla regulated genes
the average intensities of hybridization of the  <dig> genes that were less abundant  and the  <dig> genes that were more abundant  in figla null newborn ovaries were compared by hierarchical cluster analysis. almost all the  <dig> potentially up-regulated genes showed similar expression pattern wherein the expression of these genes commenced only at newborn stage of the ovary development. as expected, both zp <dig> and zp <dig>  previously described direct downstream targets of figla, were up-regulated in the normal newborn ovaries, although they were not closely clustered to each other. the four genes  that were first up-regulated e <dig>  and persisted in the newborn also did not cluster together . the corresponding positions of the genes which were further characterized by qrt-pcr and in situ hybridizations are marked by asterisks and labeled. the  <dig> genes which were potentially down regulated by figla  all had similar expression patterns with the major change in expression occurring in the newborn ovary .

of these,  <dig> of the potentially up-regulated and  <dig> of the potentially down-regulated transcripts were judged to differ with statistical significance after analysis of variance . there was no overlap of regulated genes  among the various time points except for  <dig> genes  up-regulated at e <dig>  that were also up-regulated in the newborn ovary . genes that were potentially up- and down-regulated are provided . using gene ontology software panther  <cit> , the  <dig> genes that were differentially-regulated in the newborn were analyzed based on their molecular function . of the  <dig> up-regulated genes, 25% were grouped in unknown molecular function category, 13% were nucleic acid binding proteins, 7% were transcription factors and 6% were genes with transferase activity. of the  <dig> down-regulated genes, 23% were transcription factors, and 20% encoded proteins with nucleic acid binding functions. two of these genes, taf7l and tia <dig>  are normally expressed in the testes. genes with unknown molecular function and transferase activity were comparable  to the up-regulated genes.

ovarian genes affected by figla expression
thirteen genes that were ≥ 2-fold more highly expressed in normal than figla null newborn ovaries were chosen for more detailed analysis. three were members of the nalp gene family that have oocyte-specific expression  <cit> ; five were functionally annotated genes with oocyte-specific expression; and five were functionally un-annotated. two additional members of the nalp family  that were up-regulated by figla, albeit to a lesser extent, were included in the analysis and two of the selected genes  missed the statistical cutoff because of single  outlying data points . primers specific for each gene were designed  and the presence and absence of specific transcripts in newborn normal and figla null ovaries were confirmed in  <dig> of the  <dig> by qrt-pcr .

total rna was isolated from  <dig> normal newborn organs and assayed for gene expression which was normalized to hprt and standardized to 100% in the ovary . as previously reported, all five nalp genes were expressed in the ovary with low levels of transcripts  observed in the uterus for nalp <dig> and in the liver for nalp4a of newborn mice. the developmental profiles of transcript abundance from e <dig>  to newborn were consistent with figla regulating expression of nalp4b, nalp <dig>  nalp4f and nalp <dig>  no expression was detected in e <dig> , e <dig> , e <dig>  or newborn gonads isolated from figla null mice, but all five genes were expressed in normal newborn ovaries. however, the absence of figla did not preclude expression of nalp4a in newborn ovaries, although expression was ~60% of normal. although the members of the nalp gene family share structural motifs and are co-expressed in oocytes, they are not functionally redundant and the inactivation of one  is sufficient to arrest pre-implantation development  <cit> .

among the other annotated genes, each was preferentially expressed in the ovary with only low levels  of oas1d, serpinb6c and arhgap <dig> transcripts in other tissues in newborn mice . expression of pdzk <dig> and elavl <dig> was less tightly controlled with transcripts detected in kidney  and brain , respectively. each of these five genes was first detected in the newborn ovary where their expression was dependent on figla . these observations are consistent with each gene being a direct downstream target of figla, but transcripts of each are detected in adult tissues, suggesting that other transcription factors play a role in developmental and organ specific expression. oas1d encodes an oocyte-specific dsrna, 2'5'-oligoadenylate synthetase that is ~60% identical to oas1a that has been implicated in the interferon defense response against viral infections. genetically altered mice, lacking oas1d, are fertile, but have reduced fecundity associated with lowered ovulatory capacity and defects in early embryonic development  <cit> . mice lacking pdzk <dig>  implicated in controlling ion transport and cholesterol metabolism  <cit> , had normal fertility and produced off-spring with the expected mendelian inheritance of the pdzk <dig> null allele  <cit> .

tissue and developmental expression of unannotated genes
five additional genes that were more abundant in normal than in figla null newborn ovaries and functionally un-annotated were also selected for further evaluation . three  were detected only in the ovary by qrt-pcr and the remaining two  had only low levels of expression in other tissues. all five genes had similar developmental profiles as the aforementioned genes with little expression prior to birth and virtual absence of expression in figla null ovaries.

in situ hybridizations were performed using the digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide probes designed specifically for transcripts of each gene . all the functionally unknown genes showed predominant expression in oocytes  with only background staining surrounding ovarian tissue. although some binding was observed with sense probes for , it was minor compared to the strong signals observed with anti-sense probes .

sage analysis of normal and figla null newborn ovaries
the developmental microarray analysis suggested that significant differences in potential figla gene targets were not observed prior to birth. therefore, to complement these data and avoid the bias introduced by pre-selection of elements on the microarrays, a sage analysis was undertaken to provide identity and relative abundance of individual transcripts. total rna was isolated from newborn ovaries and used to construct a normal and a figla null sage library in which transcripts were identified by a  <dig> nt tag and their relative abundance by the number of tags detected. the  <dig>  quality tags sequenced from the normal library and the  <dig>  from the null library represented  <dig>  and  <dig>  different transcripts, respectively.  <dig>  tags were unique to the normal library;  <dig>  were unique to the null library and  <dig>  were present in both. to avoid sequence-error artifacts, only tags that were observed at least twice in the normal  and figla null  sage libraries were included in subsequent analyses .

using the audic and claverie algorithm that incorporates bayesian and false alarm analyses  <cit> ,  <dig> genes more highly expressed in the normal library and  <dig> genes more highly expressed in the figla null library were identified . the data also were analyzed with other statistical tests commonly used for sage  <cit>  and fisher's exact test provided similar results  with  <dig> genes more highly expressed in normal and  <dig> more highly expressed in null ovaries. however, only pou5f <dig>  and zp <dig> were observed as up-regulated in both newborn microarrays and sage libraries and no commonly down regulated genes were observed among those identified by sage and by microarray analyses. although the microarray and sage screens were selected to complement one another in identifying potential downstream targets of figla, the lack of overlap in targets was unanticipated. the data from the newborn normal and figla null microarray data were reexamined by false discovery analysis  <cit> . of  <dig>  identified features  from the microarray data,  <dig>  had single unigene annotations  <cit> ,  <dig> mapped to multiple clusters and  <dig> were not mapped. of the annotated genes,  <dig> were up-regulated  and  <dig> were down-regulated . eleven genes , including pou5fl and zp <dig> from our initial analysis, were also present in our sage analysis. eight were up-regulated  and three were down-regulated  in newborn normal ovaries. because alternative statistical analyses  <cit>  may be useful for the comparison of these data sets, we have made the original microarray and sage data available at gene expression omnibus  <cit>  under accession gse <dig> and gse <dig>  respectively.

of the genes identified in the sage screen,  <dig>  of the potentially up-regulated genes had ≥  <dig> tags in normal and none in the null and  <dig>  of the potentially down-regulated genes had ≥  <dig> tags in the null and none in normal ovaries. these  <dig> tags were reliably mapped to genes using the ncbi sage database  <cit>  and ontology of  <dig> was determined by panther . the greatest percentage  of genes were nucleic-acid binding proteins  followed by oxidoreductases , cytoskeletonal proteins  and ligases . ten of the down-regulated genes , scattered among the categories, have sperm-associated patterns of expression .

expression of eight up-regulated genes from the sage analysis
eight transcripts for which there were ≥  <dig> tags in the normal and  <dig> tags in the figla null newborn sage libraries  were analyzed further. transcripts for each were detected by semi-quantitative rt-pcr in normal, but not figla null newborn ovaries. total rna from  <dig> tissues was analyzed and transcripts for each gene were detected only in ovarian tissue, with the exception of pou5f <dig>  which was also present in testis .

pou5f <dig>  is expressed in pluripotent cells during mouse development before becoming restricted to germ cells  <cit>  and regulates a significant number of downstream target genes by itself and in tandem with other transcription factors  <cit> . the complex pattern of pou5f <dig> transcripts in normal and figla null mice  indicates participation of other transcription factors in controlling its expression. expression of the other seven genes was not detected in figla null mice  and was first observed in normal ovaries at e <dig>  .

dppa <dig> , originally implicated in germ cell lineage specification  <cit> , is a maternal effect gene required for pre-implantation development  <cit> . oas1h encodes a 2'5'-oligoadenylate synthetase and clusters with oas1d  along with  <dig> other closely related synthetases on mouse chr5: <dig> ,130- <dig> , <dig>  <cit> . padi <dig>  is one of  <dig> similar genes  clustered on mouse chr4: <dig> ,689- <dig> , <dig> that encodes a peptidylarginine deiminase which converts arginine residues into citrulline  <cit> . it is expressed during oogenesis where it is associate with cytoplasmic sheets and the protein persists in the early embryo up to the blastocyst stage  <cit> .

each of the remaining four sage tags matched either cdna or spliced est that was expressed in ovarian tissue and/or the early mouse embryo.  is a full-length cdna from a  <dig> days pregnant adult female ovary  that maps to mouse chr1: <dig> ,975- <dig> , <dig> and  is a female germline specific cdna that encodes a hypothetical  <dig> amino acid protein mapping to mouse chr9: <dig> ,285- <dig> , <dig>  , a  <dig> bp spliced est , is part of the nia15k cdna clone set and was up-regulated in the microarray screen, albeit not to a statistically significant extent.  was reliably matched by a sage tag that also matched two other sequences, neither of which was ovary specific.  corresponds to a full-length cdna  obtained from a 2-cell embryonic library and maps as a spliced est on mouse chr12: <dig> ,672- <dig> , <dig> 

discussion
during ovarian development, oocytes accumulate maternal products necessary for successful folliculogenesis, fertilization and pre-implantation development. figla is an oocyte-specific, basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor required for perinatal formation of primordial follicles and the establishment of the extracellular zona pellucida matrix that surrounds eggs to mediate fertilization and an embryonic block to polyspermy. transcripts encoding figla are first detected at e <dig>  in female gonads and persist in adult ovaries  <cit> . the involvement of figla in two, independent, oocyte-specific genetic pathways and its persistence during critical periods of ovarian development suggest that figla may regulate other genes critical for successful gonadogenesis and development. two complementary approaches using spotted-glass microarrays and serial analysis of gene expression  have been combined to identify additional potential downstream targets of figla.

taking advantage of figla null mice and the nia ~22k microarray that contains elements enriched for expression in oocyte and early development  <cit> , ovarian gene expression was profiled at four embryonic time points from e <dig>  to newborn. no statistically significant differences  in transcript abundance between normal and figla null mice was observed at e <dig>  and e <dig>  and only two transcripts differed at e <dig> . however, in newborn ovaries,  <dig> genes were up-regulated  and  <dig> were down-regulated . this developmental time point is just after figla protein is detected in a sensitive gel mobility shift assay  <cit>  and coincident with the first phenotypic manifestation of figla null mice  <cit> . thus, although figla transcripts are detected as early as e <dig> , the major affect on ovarian gene expression occurs perinatally.

microarrays are limited by the elements spotted on glass during their fabrication. therefore, to broaden the search for potential direct or indirect downstream gene targets, sage libraries were constructed from poly+ rna isolated from newborn normal and figla null ovaries. a  <dig> base tag immediately adjacent to the 3' most sau3a <dig> restriction enzyme cleavage site was used to identify  <dig>  transcripts in normal and  <dig>  transcripts in figla null mice. of the genes encoding these transcripts,  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig>  were down-regulated when analyzed with statistics that incorporate bayesian and false alarm analyses  <cit> . unigene designations were available for  <dig> of the up-regulated and  <dig> of the down-regulated genes and 31%  were represented among the elements on the nia microarray. initially only two  were identified as up-regulated on both platforms. however, reanalysis of the newborn microarray data with an fdr threshold of 5%  <cit>  identified  <dig> genes in common, eight of which were up-regulated  and three of which were down-regulated  in newborn normal ovaries. a similar lack of concordance among different platforms analyzing the same biological samples, particularly for genes with low abundance, has been observed previously  <cit> .

'guilt by association' has been invoked to identify genetic hierarchies, members of which are co-regulated by specific transcription factors . in examining the ontology of the differentially regulated genes detected by microarray and sage analysis, nucleic acid binding proteins and transcription factors formed the largest group. one gene, pou5f <dig>  in this grouping was up-regulated by figla on both platforms and is initially present in primordial oogonia prior to down-regulation as female germ cells enter the prophase of meiosis i . perinatally, pou5f <dig> transcripts and pou5f <dig> protein once again become abundant in growing oocytes  <cit>  and persist in the early embryo prior to zygotic expression which begins in 4-cell embryos. although initially present in all blastomeres, pou5f <dig> transcripts becomes restricted to the inner cell mass, the epiblast and finally primordial germ cells by e <dig>   <cit> . the expression of pou5f <dig> is regulated by a tata-less promoter with distal and proximal enhancers implicated in regulating transcript levels during embryogenesis  <cit> . however, the molecular control of pou5f <dig> expression during gametogenesis has not been determined. a canonical e-box  is present - <dig> bp upstream of the pou5f <dig> transcription start site and represents a well-defined binding sites for basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors  <cit> . figla protein is first detected at e <dig>  <cit>  just prior to the post-natal up-regulation of pou5f <dig>  <cit>  and in both microarray and sage analyses, pou5f <dig> expression is down-regulated in figla null mice. these data are consistent with figla acting as a regulator of pou5f <dig> expression in the female germline, although other factors must play a role as well.

structural proteins, including those involved with extracellular matrices and intracellular cytoskeleton were also well represented in the gene ontology analysis and one, zp <dig>  was up-regulated by figla on both platforms . zp <dig> encodes a major component of the mouse zona pellucida that surrounds growing oocytes, ovulated eggs and pre-implantation embryos  <cit> . mice lacking zp <dig> initially form a thin zona matrix composed of zp <dig> and zp <dig> that does not persist and no zona pellucida is observed in ovulated eggs which renders female mice sterile  <cit> . figla was initially defined as transcription activating activity that bound to a conserved e-box, within the first  <dig> bp of zp <dig>  zp <dig> and zp <dig> promoters and was subsequently isolated by expression cloning  <cit> . zp <dig> transcripts can be detected as early as e <dig>  although the zona matrix does not form until oocytes begin to grow after birth; no zp <dig> transcripts are detected in figla null mice  <cit> . thus, zp <dig> expression appears to reflect direct targeting of figla during the onset of oogenesis.

all twenty-three of the genes selected from the microarray and sage screens were preferentially expressed in newborn ovarian tissue, although significant levels of pdzk <dig> and elavl <dig> transcripts were detected in kidney and brain, respectively. there was considerable variation in levels of expression in normal newborn ovaries, ranging from 14–400% of hprt levels which may indicate the importance of additional co-factors in regulating gene expression, although differing efficiencies of pcr amplification may affect these comparisons. all genes  were virtually absent in newborn figla null ovaries. those genes expressed uniquely in oocytes, may be of particular importance in ovarian gonadogenesis.

although well appreciated in simple model organisms, only in recent years have maternal effect genes have become well documented in mice. the protein products of these genes accumulate during oocyte growth and are required for successful embryogenesis. while it remains controversial whether such maternal products play a role in establishing embryonic polarity  <cit> , there is increasingly ample molecular evidence that maternal effect genes are critical in pre-  <cit>  and post-implantation  <cit>  development. mater  was one of the earliest maternal effect genes molecularly characterized in mice. mice lacking this  <dig> kda cytoplasmic protein have normal gonadogenesis and ovulate eggs that can be fertilized, but do not progress beyond the two-cell stage  <cit> . mater  is a member of the nalp family and genetic studies are underway to determine if other members regulated by figla  affect pre-implantation in mice. a second maternal effect gene dppa <dig> , also required for pre-implantation development  <cit> , was detected by the sage analysis and there may be others as well.

of the  <dig> genes that were significantly less abundant in normal ovaries ,  <dig> were testis-associated and  <dig> were classified by the panther gene ontology software . two were transcription factors, preferentially expressed in the testis, taf7l and phtf <dig>  taf7l is a tata box binding protein involved in differentiation of spermatogonia to spermatocytes  <cit>  and phtf <dig> is a putative homeodomain transcription factor with male germ cell specific expression that binds feminizing factor fem1b  <cit> . another two, tnp <dig> and hils <dig>  encode transition protein  <dig> and a spermatid-specific linker histone h1-like proteins, respectively, which are involved with chromatin remodeling during spermatogenesis  <cit> . the remaining  <dig> genes  have well characterized functions in spermatogenesis  <cit> . thus, figla appears to play a role in preventing expression of male germ cell associated genes during oogenesis. if true, additional co-factors must interact with figla in determining its affect on downstream gene targets.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these data indicate that figla, an oocyte-specific, basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, plays a pivotal role in modulating multiple genetic hierarchies involved in folliculogenesis, fertilization and pre-implantation development. although transcripts accumulate earlier in embryogenesis, figla protein is first detected ~e <dig> and affects female perinatal gonadogenesis. while some of the effects on expression may be as direct regulator of downstream target genes, others may be indirect through the activation  of other transcription regulator. in addition to involvement in the activation of gene expression, it seems likely that figla will also down-regulate genes, the expression of which would be inappropriate during post-natal oogenesis. the further characterization of the genes that are differentially regulated by figla should prove useful in defining developmental pathways that affect the postnatal female germ cell. these targets represent not only genes that affect folliculogenesis and fertilization, but also maternal effect genes required for successful completion of early mouse development.
