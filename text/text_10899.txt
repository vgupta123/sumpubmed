BACKGROUND
vasogenic cerebral edema causes significant morbidity and mortality in patients with malignant brain tumors. cytokines secreted by the growing tumor such as vegf, pdgf, and sf/hgf increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier  causing extracellular fluid accumulation. the increase in extracellular fluid, in turn, raises intracranial pressure leading eventually to brain ischemia, herniation, and death. the situation repeats itself in the setting of cerebral infarction where the initial intracellular swelling associated with cytotoxic edema is later compounded by cytokine release and vasogenic edema. clinical attempts to block these cascades have focused on inhibiting signal transduction by the circulating cytokines, including monoclonal antibodies targeted to vegf and selective receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. an equally attractive approach may be to identify selective targets on the endothelial cells themselves, which are associated with bbb alterations.

in our previous studies of blood-brain barrier breakdown and endothelial changes in malignant glioma, we have described several microvascular endothelial genes associated with bbb alterations. using this approach, pv- <dig> was identified as a glioma endothelial marker , a microvascular endothelial marker that is upregulated by glioma signaling  <cit> . pv- <dig> encodes a transmembrane protein that is associated with the caveolae of fenestrated microvascular endothelial cells. it is normally expressed in the lung, liver, kidney, and immature brain of rodents  <cit> . however, intracerebral expression of pv- <dig> is silenced during normal differentiation of the blood-brain barrier, where transendothelial transport is inhibited  <cit> . preliminary work has demonstrated that pv- <dig> expression is not only upregulated in malignant brain tumors, but it is also induced in cases of acute ischemia/stroke  <cit> . downregulation of pv- <dig> via pv- <dig> targeted sirna, decreases endothelial tubule formation normally induced by matrigel  <cit> . therefore, we suggested that pv- <dig> upregulation may indicate a general state of blood-brain barrier disruption and endothelial activation, such as would be associated with malignancy, ischemia, or trauma.

we hypothesized that the expression of mouse pv- <dig> would parallel the expression of human pv- <dig> described previously. in the current study, we demonstrate upregulation of pv- <dig> protein expression in the mouse cerebrovasculature, using human glioblastoma  cell lines grown as intracranial xenografts. we also describe induction of pv- <dig> in a mouse model of acute ischemia, further expanding the role of pv- <dig> in states of blood-brain barrier disruption. these data confirm pv- <dig> expression as a marker of bbb dysfunction and should contribute to the generation of a rodent model for the development and preclinical testing of anti-angiogenic and anti-edema therapies targeted towards pv- <dig> 

RESULTS
expression of pv-1
previous studies in our laboratory have shown that pv- <dig> expression, normally silenced in non-neoplastic human brain, is upregulated in highly vascularized, human malignant brain tumors in vivo and is stimulated by vegf in vitro  <cit> . we questioned whether mouse pv- <dig> expression would be induced in intracranial u87:u87/vegf xenografts. the u87:u87/vegf xenograft model is generated by injecting a 1: <dig> ratio of vegf-overexpressing u87mg cells to untransfected u87mg cells  <cit>  and personal communication]. xenografts derived using this combination of cell lines demonstrate increased tumor vascularity, which facilitates detection of endothelial cells and small vessels, and better mimic the pathophysiology of human gbm tumors. rt-pcr was performed using murine specific pv- <dig> primers on mrna isolated from standard u87mg mouse brain xenografts as well as u87:u87/vegf xenografts. rt-pcr revealed that both xenograft tumor strains upregulated the expression of pv- <dig> in comparison to normal mouse brain. flk- <dig> served as a positive control endothelial marker with comparable expression across all mouse brain samples . quantitative rt-pcr analysis of pv- <dig> expression in tumor versus normal tissues showed that while the u87mg tumors did consistently induce pv- <dig> rna, the degree of rna upregulation was several fold higher in the u87:u87/vegf tumors . interestingly, we have had difficulty detecting pv- <dig> mrna by in situ hybridization in standard, less vascular u87mg xenografts , although we could detect protein upregulation by immunohistochemistry in the same sections, suggesting that vegf may contribute to the increased expression of pv- <dig> mrna as well as increasing tumor vascularity.

localization of pv- <dig> expression
while pv- <dig> upregulation in mouse intracranial xenografts was detectable by rt-pcr, we wanted to confirm its induction and ensure that expression was localized to the tumor endothelium. our studies have previously demonstrated that pv- <dig> colocalizes with endothelial control markers such as cd <dig> in human glioma vasculature  <cit> . recent genomic data have demonstrated that mouse endothelial cell antigen  <dig>  is identical to pv- <dig>  the well-characterized monoclonal antibody, meca- <dig>  was therefore used to detect pv- <dig>  and the endothelial specific marker, cd <dig>  was used as a positive control. expression of pv- <dig> was strictly localized to the endothelium in the mouse brain tumors, and was consistently expressed throughout the tumor, from the core of the tumor to the tumor margin . non-neoplastic brain showed positive cd <dig> staining, but no pv- <dig> reactivity, indicating that glioma cells specifically induce the expression of pv- <dig> in mouse brain tumor endothelium . control tissues, which were not incubated with the primary antibodies, showed no endothelial pv- <dig> staining .

pv- <dig> expression in acute ischemia
previous studies in our laboratory have shown that pv- <dig> expression can also be upregulated in human patients who suffered from acute ischemia/stroke  <cit> . in order to demonstrate conservation of this response across species and to better characterize the timing of the response, we measured expression of pv- <dig> in acute ischemic mouse brains at  <dig> hours,  <dig> hours,  <dig> hours, and  <dig> days post-ischemia. immunohistochemistry was performed on frozen brain sections to detect pv- <dig> and the positive control endothelial marker, cd <dig>  as in normal brain, there was no pv- <dig> expression in the  <dig> hour or  <dig> hour post-ischemia mouse brain samples . however, sparse pv- <dig> staining was present at  <dig> hours post ischemia, and dramatic upregulation was detected at  <dig> days post-ischemia, with pv- <dig> present in the majority of the vessels within the lesion. induction of pv- <dig> occurred throughout the ischemic region and was not preferentially associated with any specific structure or domain . all pv- <dig> staining was strictly localized to the area of ischemic damage, and not observed in the surrounding normal brain tissue. mice that underwent sham surgeries did not express intracerebral pv- <dig>  cd <dig> staining was positive for all samples . vessel quantitation confirmed that while no pv- <dig> was detected at  <dig> hours or  <dig> hours after injury, the number of pv- <dig> positive vessels increased to approximately 17% of cd <dig> expressing vessels by  <dig> hours. by  <dig> days post-ischemia, upregulation of pv- <dig> resulted in no statistical difference between the number of pv- <dig> positive vessels and cd <dig> positive vessels .

CONCLUSIONS
the blood-brain barrier  plays a central role in maintaining fluid homeostasis in the brain. microvascular endothelial cells are the anatomic basis of the bbb, which is comprised of both intercellular tight junctions that prevent paracellular transport as well as the tightly regulated facilitated transport systems that modulate intracellular transport. loss of integrity of the bbb is a hallmark of numerous central nervous system pathologies, including malignant brain tumors and ischemic stroke. failure of the bbb leads to increased fluid permeability in the cerebral microvasculature and extracellular fluid accumulation associated with vasogenic edema. this edema, due to leakage from abnormal tumor or ischemic blood vessels, generates increased intracranial pressure and contributes to neurologic deficits, secondary brain injury, herniation and, in the worst cases, death. however, while recent studies have advanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the intact bbb, less is known about the endothelial gene expression changes associated with bbb breakdown.

our previous studies of microvascular gene expression in glioblastoma identified pv- <dig> as a cell surface protein specifically upregulated in the endothelium of malignant brain tumors. in addition, we detected endothelial pv- <dig> re-expression in cases of acute ischemia. pv- <dig> was initially described as a microvesicular transport protein in the immature brain of rodents  <cit> . induction of pv- <dig> expression stimulated the formation of stomatal diaphragms of caveolae, as well as transendothelial channels for microvesicular transport  <cit> . inhibition of pv- <dig> expression using sirna inhibited the expression of these structures associated with microvesicular transport  <cit> . while pv- <dig> is expressed normally in the adult lung, kidney and endocrine tissues of a rodent, its expression in the central nervous system is limited to the undifferentiated bbb and it is silenced in sites of intact bbb  <cit> . re-expression of pv- <dig> suggests that this protein may play a functional role in bbb disruption and remodeling seen in tumors and after ischemic insults.

the development of effective vascular targeting strategies requires an improved understanding of the molecular changes that drive microvascular responses, as well as appropriate animal models in which to develop and test therapeutic regimens. however, our understanding of the relationship between human and rodent endothelial biology is still evolving. for example, impressive results using anti-angiogenic approaches in rodent trials are often not reproducible in humans  <cit> . this could be due, in part, to species-specific differences in the genes regulating endothelial phenotypes. since pv- <dig> is a transmembrane protein, accessible via the bloodstream, it is an especially intriguing molecule. characterization of pv- <dig> expression in a rodent model was therefore our next step towards the development of targeted therapy for glioma and stroke patients.

intracranial u87:u87/vegf mouse xenografts were created as a model for brain malignancy. the addition of the vegf-overexpressing u <dig> cells  at the time of injection increased the vascular proliferation within the xenografts  <cit> . this made the xenografts more similar to human gbms, which are highly vascularized, and facilitated analysis of gene expression within the tumor endothelium. however, we noted similar results using standard, unmodified u87mg intracranial xenografts as well. rt-pcr and quantitative rt-pcr of the resected mouse brains showed increased expression of pv- <dig> in the mouse xenografts in comparison to non-neoplastic mouse brains. results were normalized to flk- <dig> to account for the increased vascularity of tumor versus normal brain tissue, thus ensuring that the increase in pv- <dig> expression was not simply due to an increase in the number of endothelial cells, but to tumor-related gene induction. this upregulation of pv- <dig> in the mouse xenograft parallels the increase in pv- <dig> expression seen in high grade human brain tumor samples  <cit> . the analyzed tumors were harvested between  <dig> and  <dig> days after intracranial injection of tumor cells. attempts to investigate pv- <dig> expression at earlier times resulted in tumors that were undetectable or were small and poorly vascularized, leading to inconclusive results. although larger, more stringent time course studies are required, this suggests that pv- <dig> is induced in large, well-vascularized tumors in mice, which is similar to the human state, where pv- <dig> is preferentially expressed in high-grade, well-vascularized astrocytomas  than grade i/ii astrocytomas  <cit> .

immunohistochemistry was performed to ensure protein expression was localized to the endothelium in the mouse xenografts . in addition, the endothelial expression of pv- <dig> was not generalized to the entire brain, but localized to the tumor. non-neoplastic brain did not show any positive pv- <dig> staining, but did demonstrate cd <dig> reactivity. additionally, pv- <dig> expression was detected using meca- <dig>  which is a mouse-specific endothelial antibody. this indicates that the vasculature recruited to supply the tumor was of mouse origin and not human material.

since preliminary studies in our laboratory have shown the upregulation of pv- <dig> in human acute ischemia samples, we next used an animal model of acute ischemia to determine if pv- <dig> was upregulated in ischemic mouse brain samples. in addition, the "on-off" nature of the mcao injury makes it more amenable to time course studies than tumor models. while there was no upregulation of pv- <dig> at  <dig> hours or  <dig> hours post-ischemia, minimal pv- <dig> expression was detected  <dig> hours after the ischemic insult, followed by a dramatic increase in pv- <dig> expression  <dig> days after the ischemic injury. in all cases, detection of pv- <dig> was confined to the area of ischemia, and did not extend into the normal, uninjured brain. the delay in pv- <dig> expression may be attributed to the time required to synthesize the protein de novo. the observation that pv- <dig> is strongly expressed  <dig> days after injury also suggests that this protein may be associated with revascularization of the damaged tissue and the protein may be induced in new, immature microvessels, similar to those found in aggressive tumors  <cit> .

so while pv- <dig> expression in the cerebrovasculature is completely suppressed by the intact, differentiated bbb, it is dramatically induced during states of bbb disruption such as malignancy and ischemia in both human and rodent brain. the progression and recurrence of malignant brain tumors is associated with the expression of pro-angiogenic growth factors, such as vegf and sf/hgf . tumor associated angiogenesis results in markedly abnormal vessels  <cit> . these vessels are poorly organized, irregular and tortuous. furthermore, the new vessels tend to be leaky and hemorrhagic, partly due to induction of vegf, with disrupted cell-cell junctions and loosely adherent or absent pericytes  <cit> . this leads to failure of the bbb integrity and contributes to vasogenic edema in advanced brain tumors. similarly, hypoxia has been shown to induce expression of vegf  <dig> hours to  <dig> hours after ischemic insult and has been linked to induction of neoangiogenesis by  <dig> days post injury  <cit> . hypoxia-induced vegf expression after cerebral ischemic insult precedes edema while vegf antagonism can reduce the post-ischemic edema and associated tissue damage  <cit> . we, and others, have shown that exogenous vegf induces the expression of pv- <dig> in cultured endothelial cells  <cit> . pv- <dig> expression has also been correlated with microvascular leakage in diabetic retinopathy, indicative of a role for this protein in disruption of the blood-occular barrier  <cit> . re-expression of pv- <dig>  a cell surface protein with a putative function in transendothelial transport, in brain malignancy and acute ischemia, suggests that this protein may play an active role in bbb leakiness. the characterization of pv- <dig> expression in murine models could be a first step towards development of pv- <dig> targeted strategies.
