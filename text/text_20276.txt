BACKGROUND
the soil-borne fungal pathogen verticillium dahliae kleb causes verticillium wilt in a wide range of crops including cotton . v. dahliae can be found in many cotton-growing areas and it has been considered as a major threat to the cotton production worldwide  <cit> . the reduction of cotton biomass caused by verticillium wilt is mainly due to the discoloration of cotton leaves and stems vascular bundles, decreased photosynthesis, and increased respiration  <cit> .

v. dahliae infects cotton roots and then grows into the host vascular system. symptoms caused by v. dahliae in cotton include the necrosis on leaves, wilting, and the discoloration of vascular tissues. plants infected with v. dahliae often develop characteristic mosaic patterns   <cit> . light to dark brown vascular discoloration is common in stems and branches of the infected cotton. pathogenesis of v. dahliae is complicated due to the existence of defoliating and non-defoliating strains. the defoliating strains are the most virulent, which can cause typical symptoms of verticillium wilt and lead to the complete defoliation of infected plants  <cit> . cotton cultivars resistant to verticillium wilt often show decreases in the rate of the disease progress and the symptom severity with a lower percentage of foliar symptoms  <cit> verticillium wilt in cotton is usually controlled by cultural practices, such as the crop rotation  <cit> , biological control with organic amendments  <cit> , and fungicides  <cit> . although the crop rotation and the application of organic amendments can be successfully in managing verticillium wilt, these methods are not always practical  <cit> . chemical fungicides are not environment-friendly and tend to raise concerns about the public health and the development of fungicide resistance in pathogens  <cit> . moreover, none of the available commercial upland cotton varieties is immune to v. dahliae  <cit> . conventional breeding methods for cotton varieties resistant to verticillium wilt have not been successful.

genetic engineering utilizing plant genes conferring disease resistance offers an alternative to conventional breeding methods for the improved resistance against pathogens, insects, or herbicides  <cit> . genes encoding antifungal proteins, such as endochitinase  <cit> , β- <dig> -glucanases  <cit> , and glucose oxidase  <cit> , or components of signaling pathways involved in the defense response  <cit> , have been used to generate transgenic plants resistant to various plant pathogens.

several attempts have been made to generate transgenic cottons with a higher tolerance to verticillium wilt. for example, a bean chitinase gene was transformed into cotton and crude leaf extracts from the transgenic cotton lines inhibited the growth of v. dahliae in vitro  <cit> . furthermore, the transgenic cotton line with an over-expressed foreign gastrodia anti-fungal protein was more resistant to verticillum wilt than the untransformed cotton  <cit> .

harpins, encoded by hrp  genes from gram-negative plant pathogenic bacteria, are secreted through the type iii protein secretion systems   <cit> . the t3sss inject effector proteins directly into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells and allow the manipulation of host cellular activities to the benefit of the pathogen. in plant pathogenic bacteria, t3sss are encoded by hrp  genes, which are capable of inducing host defense responses mediated by different signaling pathways, such as salicylic acid   <cit> , jasmonic acid   <cit> , and ethylene mediated pathways  <cit> . harpinxoo is a harpin-like protein encoded by hpa1xoo derived from xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae , which belongs to hpa  gene family related to the pathogenicity of xanthomonas and the induction of hypersensitive response  in non-host plants  <cit> . hpa1xoo encodes a  <dig>  kda glycine-rich protein with an amino acid composition similar to harpins from pseudomonas syringae  <cit>  and erwinia species  <cit> . hpa1xoo also shares a high sequence similarity to popa, a harpin-like protein, from ralstonia solanacearum  <cit> . it has been proposed that hpa could be involved in the secretion of type iii-dependent proteins. hpaa from x. campestris pv. vesicatoria promotes the secretion of pilus and effector proteins and therefore appears to be an important control protein of the t3sss  <cit> . we had shown previously that the transformation of hpa1xoo into tobacco conferred the improved resistance to alternaria alternata and tobacco mosaic virus in the transgenic tobacco  <cit> . similarly, a high level of resistance to all predominant races of magnaporthe grisea in china was obtained in the rice line transformed with hpa1xoo from xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae  <cit> . several other hrp genes have also been successfully transformed into different plant species including tobacco  <cit> , potato  <cit> , rice  <cit> , and pear  <cit> . unfortunately, the defense responses elicited by harpins and their active sites in hosts have not been fully understood.

in this study, a cotton transgenic line resistant to a range of soil-borne pathogens, including v. dahliae, was generated through the genetic transformation with hpa1xoo from xoo. the localization of hpa1xoo in the transgenic cotton line was investigated. furthermore the defense response and the expressions of defense-related genes in hpa1xoo-expressing cotton line in response to v. dahliae were investigated.

RESULTS
generation of a harpinxoo-transformed cotton line, namely t-34
thirty transgenic t- <dig> plants and  <dig> untransformed z <dig> plants were tested annually from  <dig> to  <dig>  from t <dig> tot <dig>  the transgenic cotton lines were screened for the resistance to kanamycin, the presence of hpa1xoo insertion, and the expression of harpinxoo. only plants tested positive for these three attributes and showed an improved resistance to verticillium wilt were selected and used for the further screening . resistance in the t <dig> progeny of t- <dig> line to v. dahliae segregated in a 3: <dig> ratio as a single mendelian trait.

four plants from t- <dig> line  were randomly selected and used in the pcr analysis. bands representing hpa1xoo, 35s promoter, and nos terminator  were detected in all four t- <dig> plants but they were absent in wild type z <dig> plants . results of the pcr analysis were verified by the sequencing of amplification products and blast against appropriate sequences in the ncbi database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . the presence of hpa1xoo inserts in transgenic plants was confirmed using southern blot analysis against a dig-labeled hpa1xoo probe. three bands, approximately  <dig>  kb,  <dig>  kb, and  <dig>  kb in length, were detected using the dig-labeled hpa1xoo probe in the genomic dna extracted from the four chosen t- <dig> plants. no positive signal was detected in untransformed z <dig> . the expression of harpinxoo in cotton leaves was analyzed using a harpinxoo polyclonal antibody. the band representing harpinxoo was observed only in the total proteins extracted from leaves of hpa1xoo-transformed t- <dig> . all these results indicated that hpa1xoo had been successfully transformed into t- <dig> and hpa1xoo was constitutively expressed in the transgenic line t- <dig> 

verticillium wilt resistance and the phenotype of transgenic t-34
the typical symptoms of verticillium wilt first appeared on plants  <dig> days after the inoculation, and symptoms develop only when the temperature is below 30°c  <cit> . in our study, verticillium wilt resistance of  <dig> hpa1xoo-transformed t- <dig> plants inoculated with v. dahliae strains vdps and v <dig> was assessed  <dig> days after the inoculation based on the degree of the foliar damage and vascular discoloration as described in the material and method. all plants were individually scored. the susceptible variety, simian  <dig>  and untransformed z <dig> were used as the control. ten days after the inoculation, only few chlorotic and necrotic spots were visible on leaves of t- <dig> whereas large chlorotic and necrotic areas were common in leaves of untransformed z <dig> and the susceptible line simian  <dig> .

the resistance of t- <dig> to verticillium wilt was evaluated in field in  <dig>  a total of  <dig> plants were scored. the characteristic mosaic pattern of verticillium wilt was rare in leaves of t- <dig> and no defoliation occurred during the growing season. in comparison, most z <dig> plants showed severe verticillium infections with the characteristic mosaic pattern on leaves and the defoliation occurred  <dig> or  <dig> months after the inoculation .

the maximum temperature reached 32°c on august  <dig>   <dig> and typical verticillium symptoms were no longer visible. disease assessment made from  <dig> june to  <dig> august showed that verticillium wilt was significantly less severe in hpa1xoo-transformed t- <dig>  compared to untransformed z <dig> and the susceptible variety simian  <dig> . the average verticillium wilt ratings in hpa1xoo-transformed t- <dig> were  <dig> %- <dig> % lower than those in untransformed z <dig> 

although the defoliating strain v <dig> was more virulent than the non-defoliating strain vdps  <cit>  on t- <dig>  the disease severity caused by these two stains were both lower on t- <dig>  compared to the untransformed z <dig> and the susceptible control simian  <dig> .

the transgenic t- <dig> and untransformed z <dig> line shared similar phenotypic characteristics including the leaf morphology, and fiber quality . although the height of t- <dig> line was lower before the flowering stage, there was no significant difference between the height of t- <dig> and z <dig> at and after the flowering stage .

localizations of harpinxoo in transgenic cotton leaves and stem apices
the localization of harpinxoo in tissues of hpa1xoo-transformed t- <dig> was investigated using the immuno-gold localization method. the harpinxoo-labeled gold particles were not found in leaf and stem samples collected from the untransformed z <dig>  but they were clearly visible in leaf and stem samples from t- <dig> . harpinxoo-labeled gold particles were mostly seen in clusters along the cell walls of leaves and in apical tissue of stems . each cluster contained an average of  <dig> to  <dig> gold particles. only a few gold particles were found in cell membranes and chloroplasts. none was found in the mitochondria .

oxidative burst in transgenic cotton t- <dig> triggered by inoculation
 <dig>  3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride  was used to detect the production of reactive oxygen intermediates   <cit> . no reddish or brown spots representing the accumulation of h2o <dig> were observed in t- <dig> and z <dig> leaves dipped in water. after the inoculation, visible reddish or brown spots were only observed in t- <dig> leaves collected  <dig> h after dipping in the conidial suspension of v. dahliae . h2o <dig> content in t- <dig> and z <dig> leaves dipped in the conidial suspension of v. dahliae was quantified using the method described by jiang and zhang  <cit> . the basal level of h2o <dig> was higher in leaves of transgenic t- <dig> than in leaves of z <dig> prior to dipping. the level of h2o <dig> increased dramatically in leaves of transgenic t- <dig>  <dig> h after dipping and such increase in h2o <dig> content was not observed in the treated z <dig> leaves .

the expressions of ghaox <dig> , hsr203j , hin <dig> , and npr <dig>  <cit>  were quantified using the real-time rt-pcr. ghaox <dig> is a key gene involved in the production of active oxygen species  in plants  <cit>  and hsr203j and hin <dig> are marker genes for hr which express specifically in plant tissues undergoing hrs  <cit> . the data was normalized to a constitutive expressed ef-1α. no up-regulations of npr <dig>  hsr203j, hin <dig> and ghdhg-omt were observed in the un-inoculated t- <dig> and z- <dig> plants. the basal expression level of ghaox <dig> was higher in the un-inoculated t- <dig>  compared to that in wild type z <dig>  npr <dig>  hsr203j, hin <dig> and ghaox <dig> were all up-regulated in t- <dig> and z <dig> after plants were dipped in the conidial suspension of v. dahliae. nevertheless, the up-regulations of these genes were stronger in leaves of transgenic t- <dig> in response to the dipping treatment . in addition, the up-regulation of dhg-omt  <cit>  encoding hemigosspol was only observed in t- <dig> after the dipping treatment .

microscopic hypersensitive response in transgenic t- <dig> after root inoculation with verticillium dahliae
leaves were collected from t- <dig> and z <dig>  <dig> days after the root inoculation with v. dahliae conidia suspension in the green house and then stained with trypan blue, which selectively stained dead or dying cells. leaves inoculated with sterile water were used as the control. the results of microscopic examination were shown in figure  <dig>  no trypan blue stained cells were observed in leaves of t- <dig> and z <dig> treated with water  and in leaves of z <dig> inoculated with v. dahliae . in comparison, large regions  of trypan blue stained cells were observed in leaves of t- <dig> inoculated with v. dahliae indicating the occurrence of microscopic hypersensitive response  . the occurrence of regions of tyrpan blue stained cells representing micro hrs  was observed in all leaves  collected from  <dig> t- <dig> plants infected with v. dahliae  whereas it was not observed in the controls  .

tolerance of harpinxoo-transformed t- <dig> cells in suspension to verticillium dahliae
to determine the reaction of harpinxoo-transformed cotton cells to v. dahliae, cell suspensions of harpinxoo-transformed t- <dig> and untransformed z <dig> were mixed with the conidial suspension of v. dahliae in a ratio of 1:  <dig> by volume. the viability of cotton cells was counted at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h after mixing with v. dahliae conidial suspension under a fluorescence microscope by staining with fluorescein diacetate . fluorescence emitted from t- <dig> cells was stronger than that from z <dig> cells . the percentage of cell death in t- <dig> cell suspension mixed with v. dahliae conidia was significantly lower than that in z <dig> cell suspension mixed with v. dahliae from  <dig> to  <dig> h . the viability of z <dig> and t <dig> cells was similar in the absence of v. dahliae conidia and almost 100% of untreated z <dig> and t <dig> cells were viable after  <dig> h .

discussion
in our previous study, we reported that harpinxoo, applied as a foliar spray, conferred cotton the resistance to verticillium wilt in a verticillium cotton nursery  <cit> . in this study, hpa1xoo was transformed into a susceptible upland cotton variety z <dig>  during the screening process, the hpa1xoo-transformed cotton lines were more resistant not only to verticillium wilt but also to fusarium wilt caused by fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum . the non-specific resistance is often related to the up-regulation of npr <dig>  npr <dig> is thought to be a key transcriptional regulator in plant defense responses involving multiple signaling pathways  <cit> . in this study, the up-regulation of npr <dig> was observed in hpa1xoo transformed t- <dig> after the inoculation with v. dahliae. this could indicate that the improved resistance in cotton mediated by the transformation of hpa1xoo is likely to be non-specific. in addition, cells of the transformed t- <dig> plants were more tolerant to v. dahliae, compared to cells of z <dig>  when they were cultured with v. dahliae conidia suspension . it is possible that the improved resistance in hpa1xoo-transformed cotton plants is also related to the improved tolerance of cotton cells to v. dahliae.

it should be noted that the hpa1xoo-transformed cotton was not entirely immune to v. dahliae under our test condition. similarly several harpin expressing transgenic plants only showed enhanced, but not complete, resistance to a wide range of pathogens  <cit> . since harpins often act as effectors which induce systemic acquired resistance rather than the immunity in plants, these results are not surprising. secondly, z <dig> is a very susceptible variety. the highly virulent, defoliating strains were dominant in the area where transgenic plants were tested. the inoculum level of v. dahliae in the region was extremely high due to the recent verticillum wilt outbreak  <cit> . it is possible that the incomplete resistance of hpa1xoo-transformed cotton against v. dahliae is partially due to the high level of inoculum and the aggressive v. dahliae pathotype in the region  <cit> .

to date, the action site of harpins in plants remains unknown. an early study of harpinea and harpinpss indicated that the plant cell wall was critical for hr inducing activity of harpinea and harpinpss  <cit> . tampakaki and panopoulos  <cit>  suggested that the receptor for harpin could be extracellular in transgenic tobacco transformed with hrpzpsph. more recently, immuno-cytological analyses showed that hr phenotype of transgenic tobacco was related to the presence of popa at the plasma membrane, which was involved in the formation of an ion-conducting channel allowing the passage of true effectors into plant cells  <cit> . this discrepancy indicates that the binding sites of harpins in plants vary depending on their origins. in our study, harpinxoo was detected as clustered particles mainly along the cell walls of transformed t- <dig>  this result was in an agreement with that reported by hoyos et al.  <cit>  and indicated that the cotton cell wall could be important for the hr inducing activity of harpinxoo in the transgenic cotton. similarly, sohn et al.   <cit>  reported that the action site of harpins located in the plant cell walls. it remains not clear that how harpins were secreted to cotton cell walls in the transgenic plants since the signal peptide was not included in harpinxoo used for the trasnformation. similarly, several previous studies showed that transformation of harpin-encoding genes without known signal peptides into rice and tobacco resulted in the in vivo expression of harpins, which conferred the improved resistance against different pathogens  <cit> . the secretion of harpins to the plant cell wall in the harpinxoo transformed cotton suggests the presence of unknown signal peptide in harpinxoo which is recognized by cotton. it is also possible that harpinxoo may utilize the plant signal peptide during its in vivo expression. although the even distribution of immuno-gold labeled particle is normal in the immunocytological study  <cit> , the distribution of immuno-gold particles in clusters is not uncommon  <cit> .

it has been reported that the defense responses induced by harpins were different between the endogenous and exogenous applications. for example, visible hrs, accompanied by the up-regulation of hr marker genes, often occur in tobacco leaves infiltrated with harpins  <cit> . only microscopic hrs can be observed when harpin is sprayed onto leaves despite the similar up-regulation of hr marker genes in treated plants  <cit> . in transgenic plants expressing harpin, the defense responses are more complicated in response to the pathogen infection. the transgenic plants show a stronger response to the pathogen infection resulting from the substantial increase in the expression of the defense related genes, such as the marker genes for hr and sar and those encoding anti-microbial proteins  <cit> .

the defense response and transcriptional expression of multi-defense genes were significantly enhanced in the harpinxoo transformed t- <dig> compared to that seen in untransformed z <dig>  in addition, we also compared the transcriptional difference in a genomic wide analysis between hpa1xoo-transformed t- <dig> and untransformed z <dig> through microarray analysis in which over  <dig> genes involved in  <dig> pathways were found to be regulated differently . these results suggest an altered regulation of genes involved not only in the disease resistance but also in many metabolic pathways in the harpinxoo transformed plants. this unique physiological condition is very similar to the so-called primed state  <cit> . the primed plants often display faster and/or stronger activation of cellular defenses to various stresses and depend on the key regulator of induced resistance, namely npr <dig>  over the past decade, the priming of defensive responses in plants by pathogen-associated molecular patterns  triggered by plant pathogens has been increasingly evident  <cit> .

in our study, npr <dig> was slightly more up-regulated in the transgenic t- <dig> compared to that in wild type z <dig> in response to v. dahliae. similarly the up-regulation of npr <dig> was also observed in the transgenic hpa1xoo tobacco but it was not found in the transgenic hpagep tobacco in response to the pathogen infection  <cit> . this difference in the expression of npr- <dig> in different transgenic plants expressing harpins could be due to the differences either in the receptor of the target gene or in the sites of their insertions in the plant genome.

in leaves of transgenic t- <dig>  micro hr occurred in response to the inoculation of v. dahliae. in addition, the more rapid accumulation of h2o <dig> and up-regulation of ghaox <dig> and hsr203j were observed in t- <dig>  compare to those in wild type z <dig>  after the inoculation. harpin can induce hr which is associated with the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates as a proximal response. a rapid burst of reactive oxygen species  followed by a chain of events often occur in plants treated with harpins  <cit> . it is still questionable whether the micro hr observed in the transgenic t- <dig> is directly related to the infection caused by v. dahliae since no v. dahliae was observed in the sites of micro hrs. it is possible that such micro hr could augment the defense response in the transformed t- <dig> by the gentle pcd  correlated with the enhanced expression of hr marker genes. micro hr could contribute to the resistance against verticillium wilt through a priming mechanism. the primed state also explains the higher basal levels of h2o <dig> in leaves of the transgenic line . dhg-omt was also up-regulated in t- <dig> after inoculations with v. dahliae. since dhg-omt encodes one key enzyme in the biosynthesis of terpenoids in cotton. it indicates that the phytoalexin-like compound may be also involved in the defense response of cotton against v. dahliae  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
hpa1xoo accumulates along the cell walls of the transgenic t <dig>  where it could trigger the generation of h2o <dig> as a cell wall endogenous elicitor. t- <dig> is thus in a primed state, ready to protect the hosts from pathogens. multiple defense responses are induced in the transgenic t- <dig> in response to the infection caused by v. dahliae. hin <dig>  and hsr203j are up-regulated in t- <dig> indicating that the genes related to hr are activated without any visible hr phenotype in the transgenic plants.
