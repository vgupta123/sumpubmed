BACKGROUND
alcohol abuse is common throughout the world. alcoholism causes neurological and psychiatric damage, as well as other somatic disorders. alcohol is also regarded as one of the most dangerous factors in traffic accidents. the biological, clinical, and social effects of alcohol abuse highlight the urgent need for objective and specific markers for alcohol-related diseases and for early detection of potential alcohol abusers. laboratory markers of alcohol consumption can play an important role in identifying alcohol intake. however, the traditional biomarkers of alcohol abuse, such as gamma glutamyl transferase , mean corpuscular volume , alanine transaminase  and aspartate transaminase , have variable and limited sensitivity and specificity
 <cit> . therefore, more attention has been paid to new alcohol markers, especially carbohydrate-deficient transferrin .

cdt refers to the less sialylated forms of human transferrin: asialo- and disialo-transferrin 
 <cit> . it is assumed that alcohol intake ≥50–80 g/day for a period of at least two weeks leads to increased concentrations of cdt
 <cit> . although the mechanism remains unknown, a large number of studies indicate that cdt is a good biomarker for the diagnosis of heavy alcohol consumption, with higher sensitivity and specificity than any of the other conventional markers
 <cit> .

since its discovery in 1976
 <cit> , cdt has quickly become the focus of basic research and clinical studies. numerous studies have shown that there is a close correlation between cdt levels and alcohol consumption, and the us food and drug administration approved cdt as a biomarker to assess alcohol intake in 2001
 <cit> . currently, cdt is recognized as an independent alcohol marker, with reliable sensitivity and specificity to identify heavy drinking
 <cit> . for over  <dig>  years, it has been used in traffic medicine among subjects applying for driver’s license renewal or regranting in belgium
 <cit> . in addition to effectively estimating alcohol consumption, cdt also provides a novel tool to diagnose alcohol-related diseases. today, cdt has clinical, forensic, and judicial applications. approximately 200– <dig> reports on cdt and alcohol have been published, but cdt levels have never been determined in the han chinese population. given the different alcohol customs in china and the west, we aim to establish a cdt cut-off for the han chinese population.

RESULTS
normal value of cdt
the nondrinkers and light/moderate drinkers were used to investigate normal cdt values. table 
 <dig> presents cdt values grouped according to gender and three age groups. there was a statistically significant difference between the genders , with male cdt values being higher than those of females in every age group. the differences among the three groups were p =  <dig>  for males and p =  <dig>  for females. the difference for females between the 0–40-year group and the 41–60-year group were also significant .

*the results of statistics analysis between subgroup appear significant.

genetic variants of transferrin
among our original  <dig> subjects,  <dig> individuals  had genetic variants of transferrin . these variants were detected by capillary electrophoresis, but this method cannot identify the exact type of b or d variant. we also used cdt-is as a control to exclude false genetic cdt variants caused by monoclonal immunoglobulins in the beta zone. all of the variant results could not be incorporated into the statistical analysis.

the relationship between cdt levels and alcohol consumption
the relationship between cdt values and daily alcohol intake is shown in figure 
 <dig>  among nondrinkers, cdt values ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. for drinkers, the lowest cdt value was  <dig> %  and the highest was  <dig> % .

based on alcohol consumption, the population was divided into six subgroups. the alcohol consumption and cdt values of all subjects are presented in table 
 <dig>  with increasing daily mean alcohol intake, the cdt values raised gradually. this phenomenon was not statistically significant for daily alcohol intake ≤45 g but showed significance when alcohol consumption exceeded this value. a difference of mean %cdt was observed between subgroups  <dig> and  <dig> , and between subgroups  <dig> and  <dig> . such a variation in consecutive subgroups only existed between these subgroups.

*the results of statistics analysis between subgroup appear significant.

cdt cut-off
we proposed a cdt cut-off of  <dig> %, based on the 95th percentile value of drinkers
 <cit> . to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the chosen cut-off, receiver operating characteristic  curves were generated . the area under the roc curves was largest for the group with alcohol consumption of 60 g/day or more. the cut-off value showed great specificity, but the sensitivity was far from ideal.

precision
the results of the precision studies are shown in table 
 <dig>  the intra-run and between-day precision of three serum pools is presented. the maximum discrepancy in the intra-run precision study was  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % for p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig>  respectively. thus, the repeatability of the system for routine testing is acceptable.

linearity
in the linearity experiment, the measured cdt values were similar to the calculated values, with a correlation coefficient of  <dig> . the slope of first-order polynomial significantly differed from  <dig>  . the slopes of second-order and third-order polynomials also showed statistically significant differences from  <dig>  . the cdt detection by the measurement system was linear in the studied range of  <dig> % to  <dig> %.

discussion
our study used the first large-scale abstinent group to investigate normal cdt values in han chinese. the mean cdt value of all non-heavy drinkers was  <dig> %. although the causes remain unknown, our data revealed a small statistically significant difference between genders. the mean cdt value was higher in males than in females. a small statistically significant difference was observed between the various age groups in females but not in males. this finding seems to be consistent with the report by bergström and helander
 <cit> . in jonas p and anders h study
 <cit> , the upper reference limit was set at  <dig> %, which is higher than our proposed cdt cut-off of  <dig> %. these differences may be due to the measurement systems  and target subjects . many factors influence cdt values, including atypical phenotype distributions of alcohol dehydrogenase
 <cit> , amount of daily alcohol consumption, amount of alcohol consumed per drinking session, duration of abstinence before blood sampling, body weight
 <cit>  and consumption of fermented food. all these factors may contribute to the cdt differences between han chinese and other populations.

our study is the first to report the frequency of transferrin variants in a large han chinese population. genetic transferrin variants result from amino acids substitutions in the polypeptide chain
 <cit> . most individuals express allele c, but at least  <dig> transferrin variants have been found
 <cit> . although only four isoforms show a prevalence of >1%, transferrin variants can interfere with cdt analysis because of their similar isoelectric points . transferrin-d can cause false positive results for non-abusers
 <cit> , and transferrin-b can cause false negative results for chronic alcohol abusers
 <cit> . these variants can be detected by capillary electrophoresis and hplc, avoiding with inaccurate cdt calculations. it has been reported that the frequency of genetic transferrin variants is low in caucasians  but high in african americans, africans, and natives of south america
 <cit> . however, there was no precise data for the han chinese population. in our study of han chinese,  <dig> of  <dig> individuals  had a transferrin-b or transferrin-d genetic variant.

we also analyzed the correlation between cdt values and alcohol consumption. some studies found an increase in cdt serum concentrations after sustained alcohol consumption of 50–80 g/day for at least one week, but other reports showed an increase in cdt values after 4– <dig> times the standard alcohol consumption for at least two weeks
 <cit> . cdt values slowly normalize during periods of abstinence. although there is a clear correlation between cdt levels and chronic alcohol intake, it remains unclear how cdt values should be used to diagnose alcohol abuse. for instance, it is unclear whether we can extrapolate alcohol consumption  according to cdt values. table 
 <dig> shows that the proportion of individuals in subgroups  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  whose cdt values are below the cdt cut-off is nearly 91%, 85%, and 62%, respectively. ninety five percent of the group with daily ethanol intake above 60 g/day have cdt levels higher than  <dig> %, suggesting that this cut-off can be used to confirm recent drinking behavior. we found a significant threshold in cdt values between subgroups  <dig> and  <dig>  , suggesting that cdt levels are sensitive to high alcohol intake, such as more than 60 g/day. we found no correlation between cdt values and years of sustained drinking . in the figure 
 <dig>  receiver operating characteristic curves of cdt according to each target amount of daily alcohol consumption were carried out. the area under roc curves was best in the alcohol consumption ≥ 60 g/day group. when setting cut-off as  <dig> %, the specificities were all above 90%. however, the sensitivities were far from ideal . to avoid the numerous biases that can be made during the diagnosis of alcoholism, evaluating cdt with other biomarkers has been recommended.

furthermore, we evaluated the analytic performance of the sebia capillary electrophoresis measurement system. the precision and linearity studies showed excellent results. cdt measurements require high precision  for clinical and forensic applications. compared with the other studies, our results of total cv were high. this might be because we selected the lower values of cdt serum pools, and our lack of high value cdt serum pools could be a drawback of our study.

CONCLUSIONS
previous studies have shown that cdt values provide a diagnostic tool to estimate heavy ethanol consumption, especially daily intake over 45 g. nonetheless, few studies have been conducted to assess this marker in the chinese population. we evaluated the frequency of genetic transferrin variants, determined the cdt normal range, and proposed a cdt cut-off from a large chinese population. further studies focusing on heavy alcoholics in the chinese population are needed.
