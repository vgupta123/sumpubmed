BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome  is one of the most economically important viral diseases in sows, causing enormous production losses in the pig industry worldwide  <cit> . it was first reported at the end of the 1980s in north america and canada, and is commonly known as blue-eared pig disease  <cit> . the disease is characterized by abortion and poor reproductive performance in pregnant sows and by respiratory distress in growing pigs and piglets  <cit> . prrs virus , the etiological agent of the disease, is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense rna virus that clusters in the order nidovirales and the family arteriviridae, together with equine arteritis virus, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, and simian hemorrhagic fever virus. the 15-kb genome of prrsv contains a 5′-untranslated region , nine open reading frames  and a 3′-utr  <cit> . the prrsv virion consists of a nucleocapsid surrounded by a lipid envelope. pigs persistently infected with prrsv develop viremia and reduced cell-mediated immunity  <cit> . important features of prrsv are its extreme genetic, antigenic, and immunobiological variability. consequently, prrsv remains the greatest challenge for the swine industry, and there is a strong demand for the development of new antiviral strategies against prrsv infection  <cit> .

antimicrobial peptides are cationic and amphipathic molecules distributed widely among organisms of both the plant and animal kingdoms that display broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities against bacteria, fungi, and viruses, thus acting as innate antibiotics  <cit> . cecropin p <dig> , originally isolated from porcine intestine, is a low-molecular-weight peptide with antiviral activity against infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus, viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, snakehead rhabdovirus, and infectious pancreatic necrosis virus in vitro  <cit> . in this study, we investigated whether cp <dig> inhibits prrsv replication in vitro. our findings show that cp <dig> exerted potent antiviral activity against prrsv infection in both marc- <dig> cells and porcine alveolar macrophages . the mechanisms of cp <dig> were also characterized.

RESULTS
cp <dig> markedly inhibits ch-1a infection and replication
cp <dig> was initially expressed and purified in pichia pastoris . subsequently, to evaluate the in vitro antiviral activity of cp <dig> against ch-1a infection, immunofluorescence assay , cytopathic effect , and the 50% tissue culture infectious dose  assays were performed. as shown in figure 1b, cp <dig> significantly inhibited viral infection in a dose-dependent manner at 36 h postinfection . the number of infectious viral particles was markedly reduced by cp <dig>  consistent with this, cp <dig>  notably abrogated the ch-1a-induced cpe at  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> hpi in marc- <dig> cells infected with ch-1a at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig>  compared with the yeast extract peptone dextrose  control . furthermore, the production of viral progeny was significantly reduced at  <dig> hpi by cp <dig>  in a dose-dependent manner . cp <dig> inhibited ch-1a infection in marc- <dig> cells with a 50% effective concentration  of 112 μg/ml. to rule out the possibility that ypd affects ch-1a replication, cells treated with phosphate-buffered saline  were used as another control. the results showed that ypd had no effect on viral replication . to determine whether the concentration-dependent cytotoxicity of cp <dig> affected ch-1a infection and replication, a cytotoxicity assay was performed in the presence of different concentrations of cp <dig> or ypd  using alamarblue®. as shown in figure 1e, no significant cytotoxicity was observed up to 480 μg/ml cp <dig>  therefore, we performed all subsequent experiments with cp <dig> at a concentration no higher than 480 μg/ml in marc- <dig> cells. the 50% cytotoxic concentration  of cp <dig> for marc- <dig> cells was estimated to be 719 μg/ml.figure  <dig>

to verify that viral rna transcription and protein translation are blocked by cp <dig> during prrsv infection, the kinetics of ch-1a replication in marc- <dig> cells were investigated at the indicated times after treatment with cp <dig>  or ypd . cells were inoculated with ch-1a at an moi of  <dig>  in the presence of cp <dig> or ypd  for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or 48 h. their total rnas were analyzed with quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction  to determine the transcript levels of viral orf <dig> after treatment. the cells treated with cp <dig>  showed a significant reduction in viral rna at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hpi compared with those treated with the ypd control . the effects of treatment with cp <dig> at the viral protein level were analyzed with three different approaches, as described in the methods. as shown in figure 2c–e, compared with the ypd control, the expression of the viral n protein was depressed significantly reduced by cp <dig> when administered with either the pre-, co-, or posttreatment method. a virucidal assay was performed to investigate the direct inactivation effect of cp <dig>  as shown in figure 2b, cp <dig> effectively inactivated the ch-1a virions at  <dig> hpi. taken together, these data indicate that cp <dig> exerts a potent extracellular virucidal activity and an inhibitory effect on ch-1a infection in vitro.figure  <dig>

cp <dig> blocks ch-1a-induced apoptosis during the late phase of infection
previous studies have shown that prrsv stimulates antiapoptotic pathways in marc- <dig> cells and pams early in infection, and that prrsv-infected cells die from apoptosis late in infection  <cit> . to examine whether cp <dig> attenuates virus-induced apoptosis during the late phase of infection, an annexin v fluorescein isothiocyanate /propidium iodide  assay was performed. cp <dig> notably reduced the number of apoptotic cells compared with cells treated with the ypd control . the inhibitory effects of cp <dig> on apoptosis were confirmed by the levels of caspase  <dig> transcripts in the virus-infected cells treated with cp <dig> for 72 h . together, these results indicate that cp <dig> blocks ch-1a-virus-induced apoptosis during the late phase of infection, which might contribute to the inhibition of prrsv infection.figure  <dig>

cp <dig> inhibits viral particle release
to investigate whether cp <dig> reduces viral particle release, an assay described previously  <cit>  was performed to quantify the viral particles in both the cells and the supernatant. marc- <dig> cells were treated as described in the methods. at each time point, the numbers of intracellular particles in cells treated with different concentrations of cp <dig> were similar to those in cells treated with ypd  . in contrast, significantly fewer infectious viral particles were released into the supernatant by cells treated with cp <dig>  for 4 h than by ypd-treated cells . the viral titers in the supernatants showed a similar pattern after treatment with cp <dig>  for 4 h . taken together, these data indicate that cp <dig>  inhibits ch-1a particle release.figure  <dig>

cp <dig> blocks viral attachment during the ch-1a life cycle in marc- <dig> cells
to characterize the molecular mechanism underlying the antiviral activity of cp <dig> against ch-1a and to identify the stage of the viral life cycle interrupted by cp <dig>  a viral attachment assay was performed to test whether cp <dig> blocks ch-1a attachment to marc- <dig> cells. cp <dig> significantly reduced the transcript levels of viral orf <dig> in cp1-treated cells during the period of viral attachment . consistent with these findings, the n protein levels of ch-1a were blocked by 480 μg/ml cp <dig> . these data suggest that cp <dig> markedly reduces the number of infectious viral particles that attach to the cell membrane.figure  <dig> 
cp <dig> blocks viral attachment but not viral entry into marc- <dig> cells.  in an attachment assay, cells were cooled at 4°c for 30 min, and then challenged with ch-1a  in the presence of various concentrations of cp <dig> or ypd  for 3 h at 4°c. viral rna transcription  and protein levels  were analyzed.  in an entry assay, the kinetics of the antiviral activity of cp <dig> against ch-1a were evaluated with time-of-addition assays. cells were challenged with ch-1a  for 3 h at 4°c and then incubated at 37°c in the presence of cp <dig> or ypd  for 6 h. cp <dig> was added at  <dig>   <dig>  or 4 h . the cells were then rinsed and incubated for another 24 h at 37°c. the inhibitory effects were determined when cp <dig> was added at  <dig> ,  <dig> , of 4 h  after the cells were shifted to 37°c. data are the results of three independent experiments . significant differences compared with the ypd-treated control group are denoted: *p < <dig> , **p < <dig> , or ***p < <dig> .



previous studies have shown that prrsv is internalized from the marc- <dig> cell surface within 3–6 h  <cit> . therefore, we investigated whether cp <dig> also acts at the entry stage of the viral life cycle. the kinetics of the antiviral activity of cp <dig> against ch-1a were analyzed with time-of-addition assays. cp <dig> had little effect on the viral titers and protein levels when it was added immediately after the temperature shift . consistent with these findings, no inhibitory effect was observed when cp <dig> was added at  <dig>  or 4 h  after the cells were shifted to 37°c. taken together, these data indicate that cp <dig> blocks the viral attachment process rather than entry process in marc- <dig> cells.

cp <dig> strongly inhibits ch-1a replication and partially elevates cytokine expression in pams
because cp <dig> effectively inhibited ch-1a infection and replication in marc- <dig> cells, we investigated whether cp <dig> inhibits ch-1a replication in pams, the major target cell type of prrsv infection in pigs in vivo. we initially evaluated its effect on ch-1a replication in pams. as shown in figure 6b–d, cp <dig> caused significant reductions in the viral n protein at the transcript and protein levels and in the viral titers at  <dig> hpi, compared with those of cells treated with the ypd control. cp <dig> inhibited ch-1a infection of pams with an ec <dig> of 65 μg/ml. to exclude the possibility that cp <dig> exerts a nonspecific toxicity that affected pam viability and thus affected ch-1a replication, cytotoxicity assays were performed in the presence of different concentrations of cp <dig> or ypd  for 48 h using alamarblue®. cp <dig> was noncytotoxic at concentrations up to 280 μg/ml . the cc <dig> of cp <dig> for pams was estimated to be 551 μg/ml.figure  <dig> 
antiviral activity and expression of cytokines in pams treated with cp <dig>   a cell viability assay was performed with pams and alamarblue®.  pams were infected with ch-1a  in the presence of cp <dig> or ypd  for 36 h at 37°c. viral rna transcription  and protein levels  and the viral titers in the supernatants  were analyzed.  virus-infected or uninfected pams were cultured in the presence of cp <dig>  or ypd  for 18 h. the expression of proinflammatory cytokines il- <dig> , ifn-α , and ifn-β  and the immunosuppressive cytokine tgf-β <dig>  was analyzed. data are the results of three independent experiments . significant differences compared with the ypd-treated control group are denoted: *p < <dig> , **p < <dig> , or ***p < <dig> .



to further characterize the innate immune response induced by cp <dig> in pams, the expression of il- <dig>  ifn-α, ifn-β, and tgf-β <dig> was analyzed in the presence of cp <dig> or ypd  in virus-infected or uninfected cells. cp <dig> significantly enhanced the expression of il- <dig> in virus-infected and uninfected cells, which would help to initiate the adaptive immune response. more importantly, the expression of il- <dig> was significantly increased in cp1-treated ch-1a-infected cells compared with its expression in cells treated with ch-1a and ypd or ypd alone . however, cp <dig> did not significantly induce the expression of ifn-α , ifn-β , or tgf-β <dig>  in pams. taken together, these data show that cp <dig> partially induces cytokine expression in pams, which might contribute to the inhibition of prrsv infection.

discussion
prrsv first emerged in the late 1980s in north america, and subsequently in europe, causing huge economic losses. it has since spread across the globe, inducing characteristic severe reproductive failure in female pigs and respiratory tract illness in piglets  <cit> . prrsv infection causes the delayed appearance and low titers of neutralizing antibodies, and a weak cell-mediated immune response  <cit> . this allows the infection to persist and the prevalence of prrsv infection is still high in the swine industry worldwide. moreover, current vaccines are losing their power with the antigenic variability and genetic drift of the virus  <cit> . therefore, there is an urgent need for safer and more effective strategies to control prrsv. cp <dig> is a 31-residue peptide, originally isolated from porcine intestine, with a basic n-terminus connected to a neutral c-terminus by a glycine–proline link  <cit> . it displays antibacterial and antiviral properties in fish species important to aquaculture  <cit> . to our knowledge, this is the first study to report the extracellular virucidal activity and inhibitory effects of cp <dig> against prrsv infection and replication in vitro, with no cytotoxicity . cp <dig> inhibited prrsv infection with an ec <dig> of 112 μg/ml in marc- <dig> cells and 65 μg/ml in pams. cp <dig> also displays antibacterial activity against escherichia coli strains dh5α, top <dig>  and k <dig>  staphylococcus aureus strain cowan i, and streptococcus zooepidemicus strain c <dig> .

in this study, we have shown that cp <dig> potently blocked n-prrsv strain ch-1a replication at multiple points in the viral life cycle, impairing rna and protein synthesis and viral particle release in marc- <dig> cells . more importantly, an antiviral assay based on three different methods of administration showed that pre- and cotreatments with cp <dig>  produced robust antiviral activity and were more effective against ch-1a infection than cp <dig> posttreatment , which is consistent with previous research  <cit> . this suggests that cp <dig> has potent inhibitory activity against the initial stages of viral infection, including the viral attachment step, or directly destroys the viral particles. therefore, we investigated the direct inactivation of the virus by cp <dig> and found that cp <dig> has a potent virucidal activity against ch-1a infection in vitro . further research should be undertaken to clarify the molecular mechanism of the virucidal activity of cp <dig> 

previously studies have shown that antimicrobial peptides, such as θ-defensin, bind to the glycoprotein b protein of herpes simplex virus type  <dig>  with high affinity and then protect cells from hsv- <dig> infection by blocking viral attachment and entry  <cit> . in this study, we identified the molecular mechanisms underlying the cp1-mediated inhibition of ch-1a in vitro. binding and entry assays in marc- <dig> cells showed that cp <dig> prevents viral adsorption during the viral life cycle , thus disrupting the initial step of viral entry into the target cells, and suggesting that the interaction between the virus and its receptors on the cell membrane is blocked by cp <dig>  however, further studies are required to determine how cp <dig> affects the attachment of viral particles to the cell membrane. because marc- <dig> cells are not of porcine origin but are monkey cells  <cit> , we also tested the antiviral activity of cp <dig> in pams, which are known to be the primary host cell target for prrsv replication in vivo. cp <dig> exhibited robust antiviral activity in pams , suggesting that it might be an effective inhibitor of prrsv infection in vivo. cp <dig> also partially elevated cytokine expression , which should induce the innate immune response in pams .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our findings reveal for the first time that cp <dig> not only has extracellular virucidal activity, but also exerts a potent inhibitory effect on prrsv infection and replication in vitro, when administered as a pre-, co-, or posttreatment. therefore, cp <dig> is an excellent candidate for the development of future antiviral strategies against prrsv infection. further research is required to evaluate the potential in vivo antiviral activity of cp <dig> in animal models.
