BACKGROUND
terminal differentiation of skeletal muscle is orchestrated by the family of myogenic regulatory factors , which contains myf <dig>  myod, myogenin and mrf <dig> . these factors activate muscle-specific gene transcription, by binding specific dna sequences  as heterodimers with ubiquitous e2a proteins such as e <dig> and e <dig>  in cooperation with mef <dig> family of mads-box proteins . they have first been characterized for their ability to convert certain non muscle cells into myoblasts after ectopic expression, a process known as "myogenic conversion"  <cit> . among mrfs, myod and myf <dig> are usually considered as "determination factors" since they are required for formation of skeletal muscle  <cit> , and expressed at the proliferating myoblast stage, in contrast to myogenin that is induced as cells undergo cell cycle arrest, and mrf <dig> that is involved in myotube maturation  <cit> . however, recent data have shown that mrf <dig> is also expressed at early stages of muscle development, and can act upstream of myod and myf <dig>  <cit> .

interestingly, myod bears intimate functional relationships with the cell cycle apparatus : its transcriptional activity and stability are regulated by cyclin/cdk complexes  <cit> , and it can repress cell cycle activators by physical interaction  <cit>  or by activating expression of cell cycle inhibitors  <cit> . regarding myf <dig>  despite numerous observations about the regulation of its gene and expression pattern during embryonic development  <cit> , little is understood about its functions, probably due in large part to its redundancy with myod  <cit> .

however, very intriguingly, in cultured myoblasts , intracellular protein levels of myf <dig> and myod exhibit opposite cell-cycle fluctuations at the proliferative stage  <cit> , with the result that, during the early g <dig> phase of the cell cycle, myod levels are high and myf <dig> levels low, whereas the opposite is true at g <dig>  since fusion of myoblasts into myotubes occurs during g <dig> phase, an attractive hypothesis is that the myod/myf <dig> ratio is an important determinant in myoblasts for the decision process between proliferation or differentiation. in this model, myod and myf <dig> are more than muscle determination factors, and act in myoblasts as regulators of the proliferation/differentiation interface. possibly connected to this hypothesis, it is interesting to note that, in cell culture, myoblast differentiation results in two distinct populations: a majority of plurinucleated myotubes that contain high levels of myod, but no myf <dig>  and a minority of quiescent cells, assimilated to "reserve cells", that contain myf <dig> but no myod  <cit> .

several studies have demonstrated that the cell cycle variations of myod and myf <dig> levels involve their specific and regulated proteolysis by the proteasome. myod degradation at the end of the g <dig> phase is promoted by its phosphorylation by the cycline/cdk <dig> complex  <cit> . regarding the mechanisms of myf <dig> accelerated degradation at the g2/m transition and throughout mitosis, much less is known, although it coincides with the phosphorylation of the protein  <cit> , and seems to depend on the integrity of a destruction-box  domain  <cit> .

to test the hypothesis that the cyclic and alternated degradation of myod and myf <dig> is not a simple consequence of proliferation, but an important event in the control of the proliferation/differentiation interface, we decided to specifically interfere with the mitotic degradation of myf <dig> in order to gain insights into the biological role of this process. to this aim, the purpose of the present work was to initiate the characterization of the mechanisms regulating myf <dig> mitotic degradation. since in muscle cells the differentiation process and the cell cycle are tightly connected, we chose to use non-muscle experimental systems in which myf <dig> mitotic degradation is conserved and can be studied in a cell cycle-dependent but differentiation-independent manner. we show that in xenopus egg extracts, which are widely used to study mitosis-specific processes, myf <dig> mitotic degradation occurs through a ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent mechanism, in a manner tightly controlled by its phosphorylation, but independent of apc/c activity. myf <dig> phosphorylation is itself dependent on the activity of several kinases and phosphatases, and thus depends on a delicate balance between these activities that finely tunes myf <dig> stability.

RESULTS
accelerated degradation of myf <dig> during mitosis is cell cycle- but not muscle-dependent
in order to better define the parameters that control myf <dig> cyclic degradation, we first asked whether the responsible machinery is uniquely dependent on the cell cycle apparatus, or whether it requires components restricted to myogenic cells. to this end, we derived from hela cells a stable line expressing myf <dig> under an inducible promoter.

in this cell line, induced myf <dig> is easily detected in non-synchronized cells, but is absent or very low in cells arrested in mitosis with nocodazole . treatment with the proteasome inhibitor mg <dig> significantly increases myf <dig> content in non-synchronized cells , but has a dramatic effect on myf <dig> expression in metaphase cells , suggesting that myf <dig> degradation, which is already rapid in the other phases of the cell-cycle, is strongly accelerated during mitosis. in addition, the forms of myf <dig> that are stabilized upon proteasome inhibition in metaphase-arrested cells are phosphorylated, since treatment of the cell extract with lambda phosphatase abolishes the shift seen after electrophoresis without phosphatase treatment .

these results strictly reproduce the data obtained with similar experiments in myogenic cells, showing that myf <dig> is strongly destabilized in mitosis, and is stabilized by proteasome inhibitors as a phosphorylated form  <cit> . thus, the machinery responsible for myf <dig> mitotic degradation is present in non-myogenic cells, and does not require muscle specific components but only the basal cell cycle machinery present in all dividing cells.

myf <dig> degradation is also cell cycle regulated in xenopus egg extracts
since myf <dig> mitotic degradation is conserved in non-muscle cells, we decided to test whether we could use xenopus egg extracts as an in vitro system to dissect the mechanisms involved. indeed, xenopus egg extracts recapitulate cell cycle events and have been extensively used for biochemical analyses of mitotic processes, particularly mitosis-specific protein degradation  <cit> , since it is easy to prepare large amounts of extracts that reproduce mitotic or interphase conditions  <cit> . compared to extracts of synchronized cultured cells, this system presents in addition the important advantage of limiting dilution of intracellular components and thus preserving the relative activities of enzymes such as protein kinases and phosphatases  <cit> .

when radiolabeled in vitro translated myf <dig> was incubated in mitotic extract , it was readily degraded, in clear contrast with the stability of the same protein incubated in interphase extract . as seen in cells, proteasome inhibitors completely stabilize myf <dig> , which does not occur with inhibitors of other proteases . thus the mechanisms governing mitotic-dependent proteasomal degradation of myf <dig> are conserved in xenopus egg extracts. it is striking to note that myf <dig> appears stable in interphase xenopus extracts, although it is highly unstable in non-synchronized  cultured cells  <cit> . since in cells, the pathway responsible for myf <dig> degradation in interphase is seemingly different from the pathway operating in mitosis  <cit> , one likely explanation is that only the mitotic pathway is active in xenopus extracts. the fact that cell cycles in early embryos lack g <dig> phase and that xenopus egg extracts do not form nuclei unless sperm heads are added could explain the absence of this interphase pathway, if it requires intact nuclei for example. thus, xenopus egg extracts appear to be a unique system in which myf <dig> mitotic degradation can be analyzed without interference of other  pathways, and we decided to pursue our analyses in this system to learn more about the machinery involved specifically in myf <dig> mitotic degradation. we note that the mitotic degradation pathway of myf <dig> appears distinct from that of cyclin b, which is stable in mitotic extracts , and degraded only after calcium activation of these extracts  <cit> .

myf <dig> mitotic degradation is controlled by its phosphorylation status
when the fate of myf <dig> is analyzed by electrophoresis during incubation in mitotic extracts , there is, concomitant with its gradual disappearance, a clear up-shift in mobility of the protein. by contrast, in interphase extracts, myf <dig> is down-shifted and is stable. this strongly suggests that, consistent with the results obtained in mammalian cells, myf <dig> mitotic degradation requires its phosphorylation. in view of the heterogeneity of the migration of myf <dig> in the gel, we tested whether the different forms correspond to differentially phosphorylated molecules of myf <dig>  we found that indeed, all the slower migrating forms of myf <dig> can be down-shifted to the fastest migrating form upon incubation with lambda phosphatase . thus myf <dig> degradation is strongly correlated with its extensive phosphorylation.

interestingly, in extracts degrading myf <dig>  the protein is gradually shifted to an upper residual form  that appears to be stable . by contrast, if myf <dig> is dephosphorylated after translation , then the protein  is slower than untreated myf <dig> to reach the hyperphosphorylated form when incubated in xenopus egg extracts  and, as a consequence, can be degraded to a greater extent . these observations suggest that myf <dig> degradation both requires phosphorylation of the protein, and is inhibited by hyperphosphorylation. to verify this hypothesis, we tested whether the form accumulating upon prolonged incubation of myf <dig> in mitotic extracts  is indeed stable. to this end, we first incubated myf <dig> in mitotic extracts treated with the phosphatase inhibitor microcystin lr. in these conditions, myf <dig> is rapidly accumulated under its hyperphosphorylated form , and is not degraded . we then incubated this hyperphosphorylated form of myf <dig> in a fresh mitotic extract, in the presence or absence of microcystin. as seen in figure 3b, in the presence of microcystin, the hyperphosphorylated form of myf <dig> remains unchanged and stable. by contrast, in the absence of microcystin, the hyperphosphorylated form of myf <dig> is dephosphorylated and degraded, in a proteasome-dependent manner .

altogether, our results strongly support the following model: degradation of myf <dig> is triggered by its phosphorylation, that occurs in multiple sites, but there is a kinetic competition between phosphorylation and degradation such that, if myf <dig> reaches its hyperphosphorylated form, it escapes the degradation machinery. in extracts where both kinases and phosphatases modifying myf <dig> are active, such as xenopus mitotic egg extracts, the equilibrium between both types of activity permits some dephosphorylation  of myf <dig> after it has reached its hyperphosphorylated state, explaining the gradual disappearance of the hyperphosphorylated form seen in figure 2a. by contrast, if phosphatases are inhibited, then myf <dig> remains hyperphosphorylated and is strongly stabilized .

the differences observed in the phosphorylation pattern of myf <dig> between figures 2a and 2d show that, in mitotic xenopus egg extracts, hyperphosphorylation of myf <dig> is accelerated by the intervention of active kinases present in the reticulocyte lysate in which myf <dig> is translated. however, kinase triggering hyperphosphorylation of myf <dig> also exist in mitotic xenopus egg extracts, since dephosphorylated myf <dig> rapidly shifts to its hyperphosphorylated form if the extract is treated with the phosphatase inhibitor microcystin . this indicates that the stability of myf <dig> is tightly dependent upon the kinase/phosphatase equilibrium of the extracts, and suggests that in cells, multiple mechanisms – including perhaps hyperphosphorylation – may be used to control myf <dig> stability under different biological conditions.

several signaling pathways are likely to be involved in the control of myf <dig> stability
an important question is the nature of the kinase responsible for myf <dig> mitotic degradation. an evident candidate is the cdk <dig> kinase, which is the hallmark of mitotic status, since its activity is high during mitosis but abruptly decreases upon mitosis exit, due to the degradation of its activator cyclin b  <cit> . indeed, in vitro translated myf <dig> can be directly phosphorylated by cdk1/cyclin b, as seen by the shift of the protein after its incubation with the purified kinase . however, if the kinase cdk <dig> is reactivated in interphase egg extracts by addition of non-degradable cyclin b  <cit> , although phosphorylation of myf <dig> resumes in a pattern very similar to that seen in csf extracts, in most experiments myf <dig> is not significantly degraded . this suggests that at least one other kinase is required for myf <dig> degradation, in addition to cdk <dig>  we observed that myf <dig> can nevertheless be degraded in some mitotic extracts resulting from reactivation of cdk <dig> in interphase extracts , pointing to the possible involvement of the map kinase family. indeed, the activity of map kinases can vary in interphase xenopus egg extracts, depending on the protocols used to prepare them, which may or may not entail the degradation and/or inactivation of the upstream mapkkk c-mos  <cit> . we found that the protein kinase erk  is also able to phosphorylate myf <dig> in vitro, apparently at different sites from cdk1/cyclin b . these results suggest that these two kinases may cooperate in the regulation of myf <dig> stability. however, other enzymes may also be involved. for example, we found that ca2+ – at very low concentrations – is important for myf <dig> degradation, suggesting that a calcium-dependent kinase or phosphatase could be involved in the regulation of myf <dig> stability. indeed, as shown in figure 4b, degradation of myf <dig> is accelerated in mitotic extracts  supplemented by a low concentration of ca2+, as compared to degradation in the same extract without supplementation. this reproducible result shows that the concentration of free ca2+ that exists in the presence of the strong calcium chelator egta, albeit extremely low , is nevertheless significant enough to alter the rate of degradation of myf <dig>  interestingly, the activity of the calcineurin phosphatase has been shown to be sensitive to such low concentrations of ca2+  <cit> . this range of calcium concentrations does not trigger cyclin b degradation, which requires a transient increase of the concentration of free calcium from 10- <dig> to 10- <dig> m for its activation  <cit> .

to define which kinases are required for myf <dig> mitotic degradation, we tested a panel of specific inhibitors  targeting the map kinase family, the gsk <dig> kinase, pkc, cdk1/cyclin b, and the calcineurin phosphatase. unfortunately, we were unable to reproducibly alter myf <dig> degradation using these inhibitors, although most of them altered myf <dig> phosphorylation status . overall, the many attempts that we have made to clarify the question of the kinases involved in myf <dig> degradation in xenopus extracts have led us to the conclusion that myf <dig> degradation probably involves several kinases, but is so sensitive to the kinase/phosphatase equilibrium that alteration of the activity of many signaling pathways induces complex and contradictory effects on myf <dig> stability that cannot be clarified by simple pharmacological approaches.

 <dig> efficiency of this concentration was tested by measuring h <dig> kinase activity after treatment.

 as judged by electrophoretic migration pattern

in addition, it seems likely that although multiple phosphorylations of myf <dig> are required for its degradation, none of the individual phosphorylation sites is absolutely necessary. we investigated this question by mutational analyses of myf <dig> in order to identify phosphorylation sites important for its degradation. since myf <dig> possesses about 20% serine/threonine  residues and many potential phosphorylation sites in its primary sequence, making it difficult to systematically change them all into non-phosphorylable residues, we decided to concentrate our work on s/t-proline  motifs, which are potential phosphorylation sites for both cdk1/cyclin b and mapk family kinases. we mutated into alanines the five serines , and the threonine  that are present in myf <dig> s/tp motifs, and analyzed the degradation of these mutants in mitotic egg extracts. although most mutants showed an altered pattern of phosphorylation when compared to the wild type protein, indicating that the mutated residues are likely to be phosphorylated in extracts, none of them was clearly stabilized . the fact that the mutant s158a, which was found to be stabilized in interphase but not mitotic mammalian cells  <cit> , is still efficiently degraded in mitotic egg extracts, underlines that only the mitotic degradation of myf <dig> is active in these extracts. if it cannot be excluded at present that other phosphorylation sites are the key determinants of myf <dig> stability, there is another possible interpretation, that we presently favor in view of the probable involvement of both  cdk1/cyclin b and map kinases into myf <dig> degradation. that is, in a process analogous to that reported for the cdk inhibitor sic <dig> in budding yeast  <cit> , it would be the number of phosphorylated residues rather than their identity that controls myf <dig> stability. if this hypothesis holds true, then only the mutation of most of these sites would significantly alter the degradation of the protein.

myf <dig> degradation requires its prior ubiquitylation
regulated protein degradation by the proteasome most often requires the prior conjugation on the substrate of a poly-ubiquitin chain that acts as a signal targeting the substrate to the proteasome  <cit> . incubation of myf <dig> in xenopus mitotic egg extracts in the presence of proteasome and de-ubiquitylating enzymes inhibitors indeed led to the rapid formation of ubiquitylated forms of myf <dig> . to test whether these ubiquitylated forms are obligatory intermediate products in myf <dig> degradation, we titrated wild type ubiquitin  with a mutant form of ub in which all the lysines have been replaced by arginines . since this lysine-less mutant cannot be itself conjugated by ub, it acts as a chain terminator if integrated in a ub-chain  <cit> . when added to a mitotic extract, this mutant strongly inhibits both myf <dig> ubiquitylation  and degradation  in a concentration-dependent manner. thus efficient poly-ubiquitylation of myf <dig> is required for its subsequent degradation, showing that myf <dig> is degraded in a ubiquitin- and proteasome- dependent process.

the e <dig> responsible for myf <dig> ubiquitylation is not the apc/c
protein ubiquitylation requires an enzymatic cascade involving  <dig> types of proteins called e <dig> , e <dig>  and e <dig>  <cit> . in this cascade, the e <dig> component recruits both an e <dig> and the substrate to favor ubiquitylation of the latter, and thus acts as the specificity factor for the reaction. as a consequence, eukaryotic cells contain a very high number of e <dig> proteins  <cit> .

however, many substrates degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in mitosis  are targeted for ubiquitylation by the e <dig> ligase apc/c   <cit> . ubiquitylation of some of these proteins depends on a loosely conserved destruction-box  motif, which is thought to be recognized by the apc/c adaptor proteins cdc20/fizzy  <cit>  and cdh <dig>  <cit> . a d-box-like motif is present in myf <dig> sequence, and substitution of residues into this 9-amino-acid sequence significantly stabilizes the protein during mitosis  <cit> , suggesting that myf <dig> could be an apc/c substrate. however, the degradation pathway of myf <dig> in mitotic cells appears different with respect of both timing and mechanism from that of known substrates of the apc/c  <cit> . to elucidate this apparent dilemma, we decided to test in our system whether the apc/c is responsible for myf <dig> ubiquitylation.

we first used xenopus interphase extracts in which apc/c is specifically activated by translation in the extract of the apc/c regulator cdh <dig> , as these extracts have been shown to be able to efficiently degrade most known apc/c substrates in a cdh1-dependent manner  <cit> . as shown in figure 6a, myf <dig> is rapidly dephosphorylated and is stable for  <dig> h in these extracts, although the apc/c substrate xkid  <cit> , used here as a control, is completely degraded after  <dig> minutes, as expected. this result strongly suggests that apc/c is not involved in myf <dig> degradation. however, myf <dig> could be an unusual apc/c substrate requiring to be phosphorylated to be recognized by this e <dig>  if so, then its dephosphorylation in these extracts could explain its stability. to avoid dephosphorylation, we decided to test by immunodepletion approaches whether the presence of apc/c is required for myf <dig> ubiquitylation in mitotic eggs extracts. in these extracts, apc/c is active against certain substrates such as cyclin a  <cit> , but its activity towards other substrates such as cyclin b is inhibited by the cytostatic factor . in order to abolish csf effect and study a fully active apc/c, we treated a csf extract with  <dig> μm microcystin lr  <cit> . since in these conditions, as described above, myf <dig> degradation is inhibited due to the accumulation of the protein in its hyperphosphorylated form, we fractionated the activated extract on a deae column. both apc/c and e <dig> acting on myf <dig> were eluted with  <dig>  m nacl . immunodepletion of apc/c, using antibodies directed against its constitutive subunit cdc <dig>  fails to abolish myf <dig> ubiquitylation in the  <dig>  m nacl fraction, whereas, in the same conditions, cyclin b is no longer ubiquitylated . moreover, cyclin b, but not myf <dig>  is ubiquitylated in the presence of the proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-cdc <dig> antibodies . altogether, these results show that, at least in xenopus egg extracts, the e <dig> responsible for myf <dig> ubiquitylation in mitosis is not the apc/c, but another e <dig> that remains to be identified.

the e <dig> involved in myf <dig> ubiquitylation preferentially recognizes phosphorylated forms of myf5
to further characterize the e <dig> responsible for myf <dig> ubiquitylation, we undertook fractionation of mitotic egg extracts by chromatography . in this type of experiments, the fractions containing the e <dig> activity of interest are identified by their ability to allow ubiquitylation of myf <dig> when added to a reaction mixture containing purified e <dig>  e <dig>  ub and radiolabeled myf <dig>  the e <dig> activity was retained on a deae column, as described above , and quantitatively recovered within the proteins eluted from the column with  <dig>  m nacl. further fractionation of the deae  <dig>  m nacl eluate on a unoq column reproducibly led to the ubiquitylation pattern shown in figure 7b: a weak ubiquitylation activity could be detected in several fractions, but the major activity resulted from proteins eluted in fraction  <dig> . we failed to observe a robust ubiquitylation at this stage, probably because we removed from the active fractions the kinases important for myf <dig> ubiquitylation, but also because the e <dig> appeared to be very unstable. indeed its activity was essentially lost a few hours after unoq purification . however, we used freshly prepared e <dig> fractions to test whether this e <dig> discriminates between phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of myf <dig>  as suggested by our previous analyses in crude extracts. we took advantage of the fact that myf <dig> is already phosphorylated during its translation in reticulocyte lysate and tested the fraction from the unoq column containing the e <dig> activity, for its ability to mediate ubiquitylation of either untreated  myf <dig> or myf <dig> dephosphorylated  by treatment of the lysate with alkaline phosphatase. figure 7c shows that ubiquitylation of myf <dig> occurs when using the phosphorylated form of myf <dig>  but is strongly diminished  when using non-phosphorylated myf <dig>  this result confirms that phosphorylation of myf <dig> favors its recognition by the e <dig> mediating its ubiquitylation.

discussion
the striking differential cell cycle-regulated degradation of both myod and myf <dig> in proliferating myoblasts suggests that these two proteins, albeit homologous and partially redundant, carry out specific functions that must be turned down at a specific cell cycle stage. physical and functional interactions of myod with cell cycle regulators, that impinge on the proliferation/differentiation interface in myoblasts, show that certain of these functions are interfering with cell cycle progression and suggest that, at least for myod, its cyclic degradation is required for maintenance of the proliferative status of the cells. for myf <dig>  much less is known, but it is likely that the same rationale can be followed, i.e. that its accelerated degradation at the late g2/m phase of the cell cycle is required for progression through subsequent phases.

nature of the e <dig> responsible for myf <dig> mitotic ubiquitylation
a strong argument in favor of an involvement of apc/c in myf <dig> mitotic degradation was that myf <dig> contains in its sequence a putative d-box motif, the mutation of which partially stabilizes myf <dig> in mitotic cells, but not in interphase cells  <cit> . however, this degradation did not depend on ubch <dig>  the e <dig> known to function with apc/c, and the timing of degradation of myf <dig> appeared different from that of known substrates of the apc/c: when examined in individual cells, myf <dig> was always degraded before cyclin b, but the timing of its degradation relative to that of cyclin a appeared highly variable  <cit> . in addition, it is noteworthy that ubiquitylation of known substrates of the apc/c is not regulated by phosphorylation of the substrate  <cit> ; the fine temporal tuning of ubiquitylation is rather controlled by post-translational modifications of the apc/c itself, respectively the core complex  <cit>  or its activators  <cit> , which modulate the activity of the e <dig>  altogether, the involvement of apc/c in myf <dig> mitotic degradation remained an open issue.

since mitotic degradation events are usually conserved between cells and organisms, the xenopus egg extract system has been widely used to dissect these events and particularly to study the functions of apc/c  <cit> . to resolve the dilemma relative to the possible involvement of apc/c in the mitotic degradation of myf <dig>  we tested whether this complex is important for myf <dig> mitotic degradation in xenopus extracts. we found by two different approaches that apc/c does not participate to the ubiquitylation of myf <dig> in xenopus egg extracts. this result raises two questions. the first is whether the xenopus system is representative of other cells and particularly myoblasts as far as myf <dig> mitotic degradation is concerned. at this point, we believe that there is no reason to doubt it, as it would be a surprise if myf <dig> was degraded in this system in a mitotic-dependent but different manner to that in cultured cells. since the mechanisms controlling mitosis are conserved in higher eukaryotes, the frog system has been central for the understanding of many mechanisms controlling mitosis  and, up until now, most data obtained with xenopus egg extracts for apc/c substrates have been confirmed in other systems. but obviously a definitive conclusion on the role of apc/c in myf <dig> degradation will require further studies in myoblasts. the second question is why, if apc/c is not important for myf <dig> mitotic degradation, the destruction-box mutants of myf <dig> were specifically stabilized in cells during mitosis  <cit> . we are presently not able to answer this question, but several observations on this issue may be important. first, the d-box is a loosely conserved motif that can be found in many proteins, and several examples show that it cannot be automatically assimilated to a signature for targeting to the apc/c . thus, myf <dig> d-box could be important for myf <dig> mitotic degradation without actually acting as a genuine d-box motif. second, there are several degradation pathways acting on myf <dig> in cells, and one cannot exclude that the destruction-box mutants of myf <dig> interfere with other systems than the strictly mitotic pathway. in support of this notion, it is important to note that these mutants are only partially stabilized in mitotic cells: their further stabilization by proteasome inhibitors indeed indicates that proteasomes are still actively degrading these mutants in mitotic cells  <cit> . moreover, we found no stabilization of these mutants in xenopus egg extracts , which, as shown by the absence of degradation of myf <dig> in interphase, seem to possess only the mitotic pathway acting on myf <dig>  third, because the d-box motif of myf <dig> is adjacent to the dna binding domain, these mutants have a decreased affinity for dna as compared to the wild type protein  <cit> . since binding to dna and presence of various partners have been shown to alter myod degradation  <cit> , it is possible that conformational changes induced by mutations in the d-box motif of myf <dig> impact on its mitotic degradation by indirect ways.

altogether, we believe that our data in xenopus are a solid, albeit non definitive, argument in favor of the non-involvement of apc/c in myf <dig> mitotic degradation. interestingly, there are up to now few substrates known to be degraded in mitosis by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, and whose ubiquitylation is not due to the apc/c  <cit> . the high incidence of the phosphorylation status of myf <dig> on its ubiquitylation and degradation suggests that an e <dig> from the scf family of complexes could be involved  <cit> . since few tools are available to study scf complexes in xenopus egg extracts, we are currently analyzing the potential involvement of these complexes in myf <dig> ubiquitylation using mammalian systems.

control of myf <dig> degradation by phosphorylation
based on the homology of myf <dig> to myod, we expected a simple mechanism in which a unique phosphorylation would trigger myf <dig> mitotic degradation. indeed phosphorylation of myod on its serine  <dig> by the cdk2/cyclin e kinase has been shown to be critical to entail rapid degradation of this protein at the end of the g <dig> phase of the cell-cycle  <cit> . however, although this simple scenario cannot be excluded at the moment, our results on the mechanisms controlling myf <dig> stability are drawing a much more complex picture.

we found a significant degree of variability from extract to extract in the phosphorylation status of myf <dig>  that prevented us from obtaining clear conclusions on the nature of the kinase controlling myf <dig> ubiquitylation and degradation. we believe that some of the problems were due to the origin of the substrate we used. indeed, there is a clear interference in this assay of kinases present in the reticulocyte lysate in which myf <dig> was translated, and we observed a variability between different lysates that was likely to contribute to the difficulty of obtaining solid conclusions. however, attempts to translate myf <dig> in other systems derived from wheat-germ or e. coli, or to co-translate the myf <dig> partner e <dig> did not fundamentally solve the problem of variability.

we thus think that the problem resides elsewhere, in the complexity of myf <dig> phosphorylation that makes the degradation of this protein extremely sensitive to the kinase/phosphatase equilibrium of the extracts. the concordant picture arising from all our attempts to modify myf <dig> stability in xenopus egg extracts, either by inhibition of kinases or phosphatases or by single mutations of the s/tp sites of myf <dig>  is that several enzymes impinge on myf <dig> phosphorylation status and thus myf <dig> stability, and that myf <dig> ubiquitylation apparently requires phosphorylation on multiple sites. however, although most s/tp sites of myf <dig> seem phosphorylated in mitotic extracts, as their mutation affects myf <dig> migration in gel, none of these sites seems to be absolutely necessary for efficient degradation of the protein. this could suggest that it is phosphorylation itself or, by analogy with data obtained for the cdk inhibitor sic <dig>  <cit> , the number of phosphorylated residues rather than their identity that is the important parameter for myf <dig> ubiquitylation.

an unexpected result in our experiments was the observation that a phosphorylated form of myf <dig> was completely resistant to degradation. because this form was the latest phospshorylated form to appear and the slowest migrating in gel, we called it the hyperphosphorylated form of myf <dig>  this terminology is coherent with the observation that myf <dig> apparently escapes degradation only when it is fully phosphorylated. however at this point we cannot exclude that a single phosphorylation event is responsible for both myf <dig> stabilization and shift to the slowest migrating form. an important question is whether the stabilizing hyperphosphorylation of myf <dig> exists in cells and particularly in myoblasts. a possibility is that this hyperphosphorylation is not a standard process seen at each cell cycle, but a regulated mechanism occurring only in certain physiological situations. alternatively, as it has been suggested recently for myod  <cit> , such a mechanism could allow a low amount of myf <dig> to be preserved during passage through mitosis, in order for the cell to be able to mobilize it immediately after completion of cell division.

CONCLUSIONS
in this article, we describe the work we performed using the xenopus egg extract system to better define the mechanisms that control myf <dig> degradation in mitosis. altogether, our data are in favor of the following model : in mitotic extracts, myf <dig> is phosphorylated on numerous residues. some of these residues, once phosphorylated, are recognized by an e <dig>  distinct from apc/c, that mediates myf <dig> polyubiquitylation, targeting it to the proteasome for degradation. however, when myf <dig> is fully phosphorylated, it somehow escapes degradation and is stabilized. in such a model, phosphorylation of myf <dig> is necessary for its mitotic ubiquitylation, but can also be used to stabilize the protein. thus the stability of the protein can be finely tuned by differential activation of various signaling pathways, providing a precise and rapid way to adapt myf <dig> levels in cells in function of the cell cycle stage.
