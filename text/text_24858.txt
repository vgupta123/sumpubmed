BACKGROUND
traumatic spinal cord injury  results in severe and permanent neurological deficits. however, there is no single effective therapeutic option to improve functional outcomes. intense research efforts, employing a rodent model of contusive injury which closely mimics human sci, have identified that the pathology in the white matter incurred by injury is closely associated with the degree of functional deficits  <cit> . one of the important pathological processes in the white matter is a chronic and progressive demyelination of the spared axons  <cit> , which occurs primarily due to delayed and widespread apoptosis of the oligodendrocytes  <cit> . absence of myelin sheath and resultant exposure of potassium channels lead to a failure of electrical conduction through spared axons, contributing to chronic functional deficits following sci  <cit> 

from these observations, transplantation strategies to provide cells capable of myelinating axons and enhance remyelination seem to be well justified for spinal cord repair. transplantation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells or glial progenitor cells derived from embryonic or neural stem cells promoted functional recovery in sci animal models  <cit> . furthermore, a large part of behavioral gains following grafts of murine neural stem cells without lineage restriction has recently been attributed to an enhanced myelination in the spared white matter  <cit> . these studies indicate that enhancing myelination by transplantation of stem/progenitor cells is a promising approach to improve functional outcomes for patients suffering from sci.

an increasing number of molecular factors that govern the fate determination of neural cells during development have been identified  <cit> . manipulation of appropriate factors may facilitate differentiation of transplanted cells to a desired lineage. the basic hlh transcription factor olig is a key regulator for the differentiation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells during development  <cit> . olig <dig>  one of the olig family, is more highly expressed in the ventral spinal cord during early developmental period of human fetus and may play a crucial role in the differentiation of oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord  <cit> . in the present study, we overexpressed olig <dig> gene in stable immortalized human neural stem cells , which have been widely employed to repair the cns in various experimental models of neurological disorders  <cit> . here we show that overexpression of olig <dig> transcription factor directed differentiation of human nscs exclusively into an oligodendrocyte lineage in vitro. we also report that transplantation of olig <dig> overexpressing human nscs improved locomotor function and increased the extent of myelination of spared white matter in a rat sci model.

RESULTS
characterization of nscs transduced with olig <dig> transcription factor
human nsc line overexpressing olig <dig>  was generated by retroviral transduction of parental f <dig> human nsc line with the full length coding region of bhlh transcription factor olig <dig>  introduction of olig <dig> gene resulted in a change of cellular morphology . f <dig> olig <dig> cells exhibited multiple thin-branched cytoplasmic processes in a phase-contrast image, whereas f <dig> nscs showed polygonal shape without the branched processes. rt-pcr analysis confirmed expression of olig <dig> mrna in f <dig> olig <dig> cells. nkx <dig> , a transcription factor which directly regulates the differentiation and maturation of oligodendrocytes  <cit> , was not expressed in f <dig> parental nscs but newly expressed after introduction olig <dig> gene . olig <dig> expression at the protein level was also confirmed by immunocytochemistry .

immunocytochemical analysis of phenotypic expression showed that essentially all of f <dig> olig <dig> cells expressed oligodendrocytic lineage markers such as o <dig> and galc , whereas the expression of those markers was rarely observed in f <dig> nscs . f <dig> olig <dig> cells also expressed myelin basic protein  , indicating that f <dig> olig <dig> cells could differentiate into myelinating mature oligodendrocytes. these results indicate that ectopic overexpression of olig <dig> transcription factor in nscs turns on transcriptional machinery for the oligodendrocytic cell fate and forces f <dig> human nscs to differentiate into oligodendrocytic lineage path. however, f <dig> olig <dig> cells did not show differentiation into mature astrocytes or neurons .

transplantation of nscs transduced with olig <dig> transcription factor into contused rat spinal cord
animals received vehicle injection or cellular grafts  <dig> days after contusive sci. at  <dig> weeks after transplantation, grafted cells that were immunoreactive to human specific mitochondria  were found in clusters mostly around the lesion sites . at  <dig> weeks, both f <dig> and f <dig> olig <dig> cells were still observed in the contused spinal cord . unexpectedly, the number of f <dig> olig <dig> cells was markedly larger than that of f <dig> nscs along the rostrocaudal extent of the lesioned spinal cord at this time point. the number of f <dig> olig <dig> cells was highest around the rostral injection site  . differences in the number of surviving grafted cells between f <dig> and f <dig> olig <dig> cells were statistically significant over the different rostrocaudal regions from the epicenter . at this time point, distribution of grafted f <dig> olig <dig> cells was different from that of f <dig> cells. many of grafted f <dig> olig <dig> cells seemed to migrate from the injection site and occupied the white matter. in contrast, most f <dig> cells without olig <dig> overexpression were still positioned inside the gray matter or around the lesion cavities, with only about 10% of them observed in the ventrolateral white matter . differences in the pattern of distribution were most apparent at the rostral regions, where the proportions of grafted cells within the white matter were  <dig> fold higher in f <dig> olig <dig> nscs . the percent grafted cells within the white matter versus total human mitochondria positive cells in the entire cross section was significantly higher in f <dig> olig <dig> than f <dig> nscs . taken together, these results suggest that overexpression of olig <dig> transcription factor leads to an increase in the number of surviving grafted cells in the contused spinal cord. in addition, they also indicate that grafted cells with olig <dig> transcription factor possess propensity for migration towards the white matter.

a recent study indicated that olig <dig> transcription factor plays a critical role in the regulation of nsc proliferation  <cit> . it is conceivable, therefore, that the presence of higher number of f <dig> olig <dig> cells may be due to a heightened proliferative activity induced by ectopic expression of olig <dig> transcription factor. consistent with this idea, growth of f <dig> olig <dig> cells in vitro was significantly accelerated after  <dig> hours in culture . differences in cell proliferation were highly significant at both  <dig> and  <dig> hours . brdu incorporation index was also obtained as a marker of cellular proliferation at  <dig> hours when the slope of proliferation curve was steepest . f <dig> olig <dig> cells incorporated proliferation marker brdu far more frequently than f <dig> cells . more importantly, grafted f <dig> olig <dig> nscs at  <dig> weeks after transplantation were positive for proliferation marker ki <dig> more frequently  than f <dig>  . these results indicate that olig <dig> overexpression can increase the size of proliferative progenitor pool and the higher proliferative potential may explain the larger number of f <dig> olig <dig> cells in the injured spinal cord at  <dig> weeks after transplantation.

differentiation of f <dig> olig <dig> cells in the contused spinal cord
differentiation of grafted f <dig> or f <dig> olig <dig> nscs was examined at  <dig> weeks after transplantation. f <dig> olig <dig> cells identified by human specific mitochondria that migrated to the spared white matter were colocalized with oligodendrocyte marker apc-cc <dig> . in contrast, as shown in figure 2c, f <dig> nscs without olig <dig> transcription factor were rarely found in the spared white matter, and even a majority of f <dig> cells that migrated to the white matter did not express apc-cc <dig> . interestingly, f <dig> olig <dig> cells that remained in the gray matter or around the lesion cavity showed different behaviors . they were usually found in aggregation and differentiation into apc-cc <dig> positive oligodendrocytes was very infrequently observed when compared to those cells positioned in the white matter. quantification showed that  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of grafted f <dig> olig <dig> nscs were colocalized with apc-cc <dig> as compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for parental f <dig> cells  . when the measurement was confined to the white matter,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of f <dig> olig <dig> nscs were doubly positive for human specific mitochondria and apc-cc <dig>  f <dig> olig <dig> nscs in the spared white matter also express mbp , a cell type specific marker for myelinating oligodendrocytes, suggesting that f <dig> olig <dig> cells in the spared white matter differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes that were capable of producing myelin. consistent with these results, most f <dig> olig <dig> nscs in the white matter did not colocalize with astroglial marker gfap . in the gray matter, a small proportion of f <dig> olig <dig> nscs expressed gfap. f <dig> nscs in the gray matter showed a very similar extent of differentiation into astrocytes . overall, approximately 10% of both f <dig> and f <dig> olig <dig> cells differentiated into astrocytes . neuronal differentiation was rarely observed in either f <dig> or f <dig> olig <dig> nscs in the gray matter . these findings suggested that the majority of f <dig> olig <dig> or f <dig> nscs in the gray matter remained undifferentiated. indeed, many of f <dig> or f <dig> olig <dig> nscs in the gray matter, especially around the lesion cavities, were still positive for immature nsc marker nestin .

transplantation of f <dig> olig <dig> nscs increased the volume of spared white matter and enhanced tissue sparing
the areas of myelinated white matter were measured in the eriochrome-stained transverse spinal cord sections , and the volume of spared white matter was calculated using cavalieri's principle. transplantation of f <dig> nscs did not affect the mean volume of spared white matter compared to vehicle group . in contrast, f <dig> olig <dig> grafts significantly increased the volume of spared white matter compared to vehicle and f <dig> groups  . we also measured the volume of cystic cavities, and found that transplantation of f <dig> olig <dig> nscs significantly reduced the volume of cystic cavities  . one-way anova revealed significant differences in the volume of cavities between the three groups , and tukey's posthoc analysis showed a significant difference only between vehicle and f <dig> olig <dig> groups .

extent of myelination in the spared white matter
the observation that f <dig> olig <dig> nscs in the white matter differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes and that transplantation of f <dig> olig <dig> nscs increased the volume of spared white matter led us to examine the extent of myelination in the white matter. thickness of individual myelin sheaths and diameter of the axons were measured in semithin  spinal cord sections stained with toluidine blue . in toluidine blue stained transverse sections, regions devoid of myelinated axons were frequently observed in the white matter after sci . such demyelinated regions were less frequent in animals with f <dig> olig <dig> grafts . degenerating axons were also less frequently observed in f <dig> olig <dig> group. we found that the mean myelin ratio was higher in animals with f <dig> cells compared to vehicle group . transplantation of f <dig> olig <dig> cells further increased the mean myelin ratio. one-way anova revealed a significant group effect on the thickness of myelin sheath . tukey's posthoc analysis showed significant differences between f <dig> olig <dig> and vehicle or f <dig> groups , and the difference between f <dig> and vehicle groups was also significant . distribution of the myelin ratio in f <dig> olig <dig> group was most shifted to the right compared to the other groups in the cumulative frequency histogram , indicating that a higher proportion of axons were ensheathed by thicker myelin in animals with f <dig> olig <dig> grafts.

transplantation of f <dig> olig <dig> nscs improves locomotor recovery
bbb locomotor rating scale was used to assess the extent of locomotor recovery. most animals were not able to move their hindlimbs or showed only slight movement of their hip and/or knee joints immediately after contusive injury at the t <dig> segment. the locomotor deficits were rapidly recovered during the first two weeks regardless of treatment . the average locomotor scale of the animals with vehicle injection or transplantation of f <dig> hnscs began to plateau at  <dig> weeks and did not show remarkable changes until  <dig> weeks after injury, the last time point measured. animals with f <dig> olig <dig> grafts continuously improved locomotor score even after  <dig> weeks of injury to the extent where they could regain coordination between the fore- and hindlimbs with almost consistent weight-supported plantar steps . repeated measures two-way anova revealed a significant treatment effect over time . tukey's posthoc analysis at each time point showed significant differences in the mean bbb score from  <dig> weeks after injury . we also measured the number of paw placement errors in grid walk, which is generally regarded as more challenging to injured animals than open field locomotion. although sham operated animals crossed the grid runway with very few errors, injured animals made more than ten errors per each run , suggesting that spinal injury severely compromised the sensorimotor integration of the hindlimbs. transplantation of either f <dig> or f <dig> olig <dig> cells did not significantly reduce the number errors on grid.

the quality of hindlimbs movement during locomotion was also measured using footprint analysis. spinal injury resulted in an increase of the distance between the two hindlimbs  by about 40% . transplantation of f <dig> cells slightly reduced the distance, and the animals with f <dig> olig <dig> grafts almost completely normalized the interlimb distance . the animals with spinal injury also exhibited shorter stride length in both limbs than sham operated rats. transplantation of f <dig> olig <dig> cells tended to restore normal stride length, although the difference was not statistically significant . these results suggest that grafting hnscs transduced with olig <dig> transcription factor into the contused spinal cord enhances recovery of open field locomotion and improves quality of the hindlimbs movement during locomotion.

discussion
in the present study, we demonstrated that transduction of human nscs with olig <dig> transcription factor induces the expression of various phenotypic markers of the oligodendrocyte in vitro. the olig transcription factors  are required for the phenotypic determination of oligodendrocytes during development. genetic ablation of olig transcription factors resulted in the absence of oligodendrocytes and motor neurons  <cit> . in the spinal cord, olig <dig> seems to play a more crucial role for the specification of oligodendrocyte phenotype, since olig <dig> expression in the early spinal cord is higher than that of olig <dig>  <cit> . in the present study, overexpression of olig <dig> in the human nscs led to an activation of nkx <dig> , which is known to initiate the expression of oligodendrocyte-specific proteins in collaboration with olig <dig>  <cit> . this finding is consistent with the recent reports that overexpression of olig <dig> transcription factor is sufficient to induce the expression of nkx <dig>  and differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells into oligodendrocytes  <cit> . taken together, these results indicate that forced expression of olig <dig> is sufficient to activate the cellular machinery in nscs that favors phenotypic differentiation into oligodendrocytes.

although f <dig> olig <dig> cells in the white matter differentiated into apc-cc <dig> positive oligodendrocytes, the same cells that remained in the gray matter exhibited different biological behaviors. f <dig> olig <dig> cells in the gray matter very infrequently differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes or any other neural cells. f <dig> nscs, which are mostly confined around the lesioned areas, also showed very poor differentiation potential. this phenomenon indicates that lesion environment of the spinal cord  inhibits differentiation of transplanted cells as previously reported  <cit> . in f <dig> olig <dig> cells that do not migrate towards the white matter, genetic modification of differentiation properties may not be sufficient to override the influence of lesion environment. alternatively, adequate environmental factors, which are produced by the white matter, might be required for proper differentiation of f <dig> olig <dig> cells. f <dig> olig <dig> cells also exhibited much higher capacity for migration towards the white matter than parental f <dig> cells. it is possible that demyelinating but intact axons may produce certain molecular cues to recruit oligodendrocyte lineage cells from the transplantation sites  <cit> . most of the parental f <dig> nscs without olig <dig> overexpression, however, might not possess capacity to respond to such a signal. these observations may exemplify the importance of an adequate crosstalk between cell-autonomous traits of transplanted cells and host environmental factors for the successful integration of exogenous cellular grafts.

transplantation of f <dig> olig <dig> nscs significantly increased the volume of myelinated white matter. furthermore, animals with f <dig> olig <dig> grafts showed significantly higher myelin ratio in the spared white matter. these data suggest a possibility that f <dig> olig <dig> cells differentiated into functional oligodendrocytes and participated in remyelinating denuded axons in the residual ventrolateral white matter. it is also possible that f <dig> olig <dig> nscs in the spared white matter exerted trophic effects  <cit> , which could prevent further demyelination and promote endogenous remyelination process  <cit> . our finding that f <dig> nsc grafts, which rarely differentiated into oligodendrocytes, also increased myelin ratio to some extent supports the notion that the trophic mechanisms were indeed in operation. therefore, the higher myelin ratio in animals with transplantation of f <dig> olig <dig> nscs could be accounted for by both direct remyelination and trophic effects by the grafted cells.

we found in the present study that the overall number of f <dig> olig <dig> cells detected at  <dig> weeks after transplantation was larger than that of nscs across the rostrocaudal extent of the spinal cord examined. a recent study has reported that olig <dig> critically regulates replication competence in neural stem cells and malignant glioma  <cit> : for example, loss of olig <dig> resulted in a dramatic reduction of neural stem cell proliferation. our data also demonstrated that olig <dig> overexpressing human nscs possess higher proliferative capacity in vitro and in vivo. therefore, the larger number of f <dig> olig <dig> cells detected after the transplantation could be explained by the influence of olig <dig> gene on proliferation potential of nscs. despite the proliferation-promoting effect of olig <dig> gene, we did not observe a gross tumor formation. this is consistent with the fact that olig <dig> is not sufficient for brain cancer formation  <cit> . it is conceivable that the increase in the number of grafted cells may have contributed to a better preservation of spinal cord tissue in animals with f <dig> olig <dig> grafts. many of f <dig> olig <dig> or f <dig> cells that stayed in the gray matter or around the lesion cavity did not acquire any mature phenotype. these undifferentiated progenitor cells can exert neuroprotective effects by paracrine actions from secreted molecules or via an immunomodulatory mechanism  <cit> . furthermore, undifferentiated nscs can promote axonal sprouting/regeneration by producing neurotrophic factors or acting as a kind of cellular guidance  <cit> . f <dig> human nscs have been shown to produce various neurotrophic factors  <cit> . the presence of a much larger number of grafted nscs in f <dig> olig <dig> group could promote tissue sparing or axonal growth of a much larger magnitude, which then resulted in the reduction of cavity volume. it is likely that the neuroprotective and/or neuroregenerative mechanism by grafted f <dig> olig <dig> cells, together with enhanced myelination in the white matter, contributed to improvement in the quality of locomotion.

the animals grafted with f <dig> olig <dig> cells improved quality of hindlimb locomotion as assessed by bbb score and footprint analysis. they exhibited better coordination between hind- and forelimbs. the smaller distance between the two hindlimbs  in animals with f <dig> olig <dig> grafts suggests an improved balance during locomotion. however, there was no difference in the number of errors in grid walk test between the treatment groups. walking on the grid runway requires precise motor control  integrated with sensory information on the grid and thus depends on the integrity of supraspinal projections more heavily than spontaneous locomotor behavior  <cit> . regaining supraspinal control may not be achieved merely by enhancement of myelination without regeneration of severed axons. in this regard, it may be necessary to combine strategies that are aimed at inducing axonal regeneration to achieve more meaningful functional improvement after sci.

several studies have highlighted the therapeutic benefits of supplying new oligodendrocytes by transplantation of stem/progenitor cells following sci  <cit> . transplantation of retinoic acid-treated or predifferentiated embryonic stem cells resulted in differentiation into oligodendrocyte lineage and improvement of behavioral recovery after sci  <cit> . although no tumor formation was reported, the possibility of teratocarcinoma formation in a longer term still raises a safety issue in using embryonic stem cells. transplantation of multipotent or glial lineage-restricted neural stem/progenitor cells also successfully promoted myelination and enhanced functional recovery  <cit> . however, the efficiency of oligodendrocyte differentiation might be unsatisfactory or additional measures would be needed to improve the differentiation efficiency  <cit> . the present study is the first to utilize a molecular factor governing the fate determination of oligodendrocytes to enforce oligodendrocytic differentiation following sci. the beneficial outcomes of the current approach would provide a promising alternative to supply myelinating oligodendrocytes for spinal cord repair.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study showed that transplantation of human nscs genetically modified to express olig <dig> transcription factor into the contused spinal cord enhances the extent of myelination in the spared white matter and improved locomotor recovery. transplantation of neural stem/progenitor cells genetically modified to differentiate into oligodendrocytic lineage may be an effective strategy to improve functional outcomes following traumatic injuries to the spinal cord. our study further suggests that manipulation of molecular factors governing cell fate decisions during development can influence the fate of grafted neural stem/progenitor cells and positively affect the reparative potential of the transplantation therapy.
