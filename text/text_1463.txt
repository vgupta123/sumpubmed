BACKGROUND
the evolution of antibiotic resistance by a variety of human pathogens is a looming public health threat  <cit> . salmonella is a major human pathogen and a model organism for bacterial pathogenesis research  <cit> . s. enterica subspecies i serovar typhimurium  is the principle subspecies employed in molecular biology and its variants are causative agents in gastroenteritis in humans. the publication of the annotated genome for s. typhimurium lt <dig> provided a foundation for numerous applications, such as drug discovery  <cit> . previous efforts to systematically identify candidate drug targets within metabolism did not result in a plethora of new candidates, due to the robustness and redundancy of s. typhimurium's metabolic network  <cit> . since new single protein targets are missing, we need to target multiple proteins conjointly. unfortunately, antibiotic regimens, which require multiple targets to be hit simultaneously, have an increased probability of the pathogen evolving resistance relative to a single target therapy. however, the continuous clinical success of the combination of beta-lactams and beta-lactamase inhibitors actually demonstrates that inhibitor combinations can be successful even if each individual inhibitor is non-effective on its own. the robustness inherent to s. typhimurium's metabolic network imposes combinatorial challenges for in vitro and in vivo approaches to identify synthetic lethal genes sets . employing a systems biology network perspective could facilitate their identification.

genome scale network reconstructions   <cit>  represent biochemical, genetic, and genomic  knowledge-bases  <cit>  for target organisms; and have been developed for expression  <cit> , metabolic  <cit> , regulatory  <cit> , and signaling  <cit>  networks. metabolic reconstructions  are the most developed out of the four genres. the metabolic network reconstruction process is well established  <cit>  and has been used for various biotechnological and biomedical applications  <cit> . given the rapidly growing interest in mrs and modeling, parallel reconstruction efforts for the same target organism have arisen and resulted in alternative mrs for a number of organisms  <cit> . these parallel mrs may vary in content and format due to differences in reconstruction approaches, literature interpretation, and domain expertise of the reconstructing group. subsequent network comparison and discoveries are hampered by these differences. consequently, the need for a community approach to divide the substantial effort required in reconciling and expanding these mrs has been formulated  <cit> .

RESULTS
salmonella, a reconstruction jamboree for an infectious disease agent
in june  <dig>  it became apparent that two mrs were being assembled by two different research groups  <cit>  . subsequently, a salmonella reconstruction jamboree was held at the university of iceland, reykjavik, from september 5th to 6th,  <dig>  the jamboree team consisted of over  <dig> experts in microbiology, proteomics, salmonella physiology, and computational modeling. based on the experience with the yeast reconstruction jamboree  <cit> , a methodology was devised to increase the efficiency of community-based network reconstruction  <cit>  and applied to the salmonella reconstruction jamboree.

the goal of a network reconstruction jamboree is to provide a 2-d genome annotation that is of higher quality than it may be achieved by bioinformatic analyses alone  <cit> . the objective of this jamboree was to re-evaluate, reconcile, and expand the currently available mrs for s. typhimurium with a focus on virulence. furthermore, we aimed to include standard identifiers for reconstruction metabolites, reactions, and genes to facilitate subsequent mapping of 'omics' data. the starting mrs were ajrecon  and brecon , which were derived from published e. coli mrs, ijr <dig>  <cit>  and iaf <dig>  <cit> , respectively, and their contents were modified to account for salmonella-specific properties; i.e., transport and enzymatic reactions not present in salmonella were removed and the proteins associated with the reactions were modified to contain proteins present in s. typhimurium lt <dig> 

comparison of two metabolic reconstructions for s. typhimurium
we developed an automatic approach to initiate the reconciliation of the two mrs by converting their metabolites and reactions into a common language . the mr contents were grouped into three categories:  identical,  similar, and  dissimilar. a similar reaction was one, in which there was a minor discrepancy, such as reaction reversibility, a missing reactant or product, or a difference in associated enzyme. dissimilar reactions were those with distinct sets of reactants and products, and often represented metabolic reactions that were not included in one of the starting mrs. the identical content was transferred to the consensus mr without further evaluation. the similar and dissimilar content was evaluated at the jamboree. genes and proteins associated with the reactions were also carefully compared and refined where necessary. at its end, the meeting yielded an approximately 80% reconciled consensus reconstruction. the remaining discrepancies were manually curated by the bumann and palsson groups following the jamboree meeting.

initial comparison revealed that there were  <dig> reactions common to the starting mrs while  <dig> and  <dig> reactions were unique to ajrecon and brecon, respectively . some of these differences could be explained by changes introduced to the e. coli mr when it was converted from its earlier version, ijr <dig>  <cit> , to the most recent version, iaf <dig>  <cit>  .

characteristics of the salmonella consensus reconstruction
the resulting knowledge-base, stm_v <dig>  , represents the final product of a community-effort to develop a detailed mr of s. typhimurium. stm_v <dig>  integrates the novel and common features of the starting mrs into a vetted, well-documented consensus knowledge-base, capturing currently available bigg knowledge about s. typhimurium. key features of stm_v <dig>  include i) accounting for the periplasm as a compartment between the extracellular space and cytoplasm; ii) salmonella-specific virulence characteristics, such as iron chelation by salmochelin and serovar typhimurium lt <dig> o-antigen production; iii) the possibility to employ the consensus mr as mathematical, predictive model; and iv) comprehensive support data for reactions and associated genes . some information was excluded from stm_v <dig> , such as the  <dig> dipeptide and tripeptide transport/digestion reactions that are present in ajrecon, as they represent generic compounds. accounting for all potential consumable oligopeptides would make computational analysis intractable or unnecessarily difficult. appropriate oligopeptides may be manually added to stm_v <dig>  to represent a specific growth environment. we also attempted to exclude reactions that were included to fit some growth data  <cit> , but were contrary to other observations  <cit>  as was the case for growth with d-aspartic acid  <cit>  as the sole carbon source which requires an unknown transporter and an unknown aspartate racemase  <cit> .

additionally, we evaluated the reaction directionality of consensus mr reactions by considering thermodynamic properties of participating metabolites. in the case that a thermodynamic prediction was inconsistent with experimental evidence, the experimental evidence was followed. thermodynamic predictions are made using the knowledge that is available  <cit> , and incorrect predictions highlight gaps in our knowledge of biology.

a bacterial mr often includes a biomass reaction that lists all known biomass precursors and their fractional contribution necessary to produce a new bacterial cell in a given environment. the individual biomass constituents of a s. typhimurium cell have been measured  <cit> , and adapted for the consensus reconstruction by accounting for the changes in naming and compartments introduced during reconciliation .

comparison with a third metabolic reconstruction of s. typhimurium
after finishing the consensus reconstruction, a third metabolic reconstruction  was published  <cit> . similar to one of our starting mrs , ima <dig> was built by using homology, and other bioinformatics criteria  <cit> , starting from the e. coli metabolic reconstruction . gaps in ima <dig> were detected and filled with gapfind and gapfill, respectively  <cit> ; and ima945's content was further augmented by the growmatch algorithm  <cit>  to fit experimental measurements. these automated optimization methods are excellent tools for identifying gaps in network reconstructions and proposing candidate reactions to fill these gaps and fit the model to growth data, however, they often do not associate genes with the candidate reactions. the candidate reactions are typically taken from a universal reaction database  that includes pathways from all domains of life, thus candidate reactions proposed by these methods should be taken as hypotheses and require additional validation from published literature or direct experimental evidence.

we performed a preliminary comparison between stm_v <dig>  and ima <dig>  however, we did not reconcile ima <dig> with the consensus reconstruction, as this will require detailed evaluation of the discrepancies in a subsequent jamboree meeting. overall,  <dig>  reactions were present in both the consensus reconstruction and ima <dig>  of which  <dig>  reactions have identical gene-protein-reaction  associations . a total of  <dig> reactions had identical reaction identifiers but different reactions  and gpr associations. there were a total of  <dig> distinct reaction ids between stm_v <dig>  and ima945:  <dig> were unique to stm_v <dig>  and  <dig> to ima <dig>  of the  <dig> reactions flagged as unique to ima <dig>  the majority represents reactions that were intentionally excluded from the consensus reaction . some of the distinct reactions, such as adenosylcobalamin phosphate synthase, were due to different metabolite and reaction identifiers. no bibliomic data were included in ima <dig>  so it was not possible to assess whether the reactions were inserted by the automated gap-filling methods or supported by additional evidence. the  <dig> reactions unique to stm_v <dig>  include salmonella-specific chelators, o-antigens, and lipid modifications that were not present in the starting network derived from the e. coli mr . overall, the core metabolic network is similar between stm_v <dig>  and ima <dig>  which is expected as the draft scaffolds for both mrs were derived from e. coli mrs and s. typhimurium has a notable metabolic homology with e. coli; however, stm_v <dig>  includes over  <dig> more genes than ima <dig> and includes a variety of salmonella-specific reactions that are essential for virulence and could serve as coupling points for constructing a host-pathogen model.

metabolic network reconstruction assessment
to assess the utility of a mathematical approximation of reality, it is essential to determine the consistency of the model's predictions with real-world benchmarks. in the case of mrs, comparing experimental growth data with predicted biomass production is a commonly employed metric in benchmarking metabolic models  <cit> . although biomass production is a commonly employed metric, the results should always be taken with a grain of salt; for instance, it is possible to improve the fitting of a model's predictions to growth data by including enzymatic reactions for which no evidence exists or which are contrary to published experimental observations. the reconstruction committee chose not to include invalidated enzymatic reactions that improved the fit between growth predictions and experimental observations; the failings of the model's predictions highlight areas where knowledge is lacking and experimental undertakings could identify new knowledge.

for s. typhimurium, there is a wealth of experimental growth data  <cit> . overall, we found good agreement between the qualitative growth phenotype predictions and the experimental data ; with the notable exception of sulfur metabolism where the prediction accuracy was about 40%. as we are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of sulfur-related metabolism in host-pathogen interactions  <cit> , the deficiencies in our knowledge highlighted by this analysis represent viable targets for experimental enquiry. for the carbon and nitrogen sources accessible by ajrecon our results were comparable, however stm_v <dig>  has the ability to metabolize  <dig> carbon sources and  <dig> nitrogen sources not accessible to ajrecon. the additional metabolic capabilities of stm_v <dig>  are due, in part, to the presence of ~ <dig> additional gene products in stm_v <dig> .

source
gene essentiality simulations
to combat the rise in antibiotic-resistant pathogens, it is crucial to identify new drug targets. genes or sets of genes that are essential for growth are potential drug targets. to identify novel drug targets in stm_v <dig> , we performed single and double gene deletion studies. we identified  <dig> essential genes in m9/glc,  <dig> of which were also essential in lb . the synthetic lethal gene pair simulations were performed using only genes that were found to be non-essential in the condition of interest . in m9/glc, there were  <dig> synthetic lethal gene-pairs comprised of  <dig> unique genes. for e. coli, suthers et al.  <cit>  predicted  <dig> synthetic lethal gene-pairs, however, there were only  <dig> unique genes involved. in lb, there were  <dig> synthetic lethal gene-pairs comprised of  <dig> unique genes. interestingly,  <dig> of lb synthetic lethal genes were also essential in m9/glc and were members of  <dig> of the lb synthetic lethal gene-pairs. the very small fraction of essential synthetic lethal gene pairs  emphasizes the robustness of s. typhimurium's metabolic network, which has previously been noted  <cit> .

candidate drug targets
our observed, very small number of synthetic lethal pairs in stm_v <dig>  indicates that antimicrobial regimens may need to target more than two elements to be effective. unfortunately, it will take less time for a pathogen to evolve a solution to a conjoint two-target antimicrobial strategy compared to a single-target strategy. to reduce the probability of a pathogen evolving resistance to a conjoint two-target strategy, it may be plausible to employ a combination of two-target strategies. although a combination approach may be suitable for dealing with antibiotic resistance, there are potential shortcomings associated with clearance and toxicity because all the components of a regimen must reach a target at a specific time with the requisite concentrations. despite these difficulties, multi-component, multi-target drugs are becoming standard therapeutics for complex diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and infectious diseases  <cit> . experimental identification and characterization of therapeutic strategies that require multiple targets for effectiveness is a resource intensive undertaking . an in silico approach using an mr, such as stm_v <dig> , could be implemented to prioritize the experiments by indicating which multi-target therapies would adversely affect the pathogen's metabolic capabilities.

as mentioned above, the synthetic gene deletion analysis yielded  <dig> synthetic lethal gene pairs disrupting growth of s. typhimurium in silico. we grouped these gene pairs based on different criteria to assess their potential value as multi-drug targets . it is notable that five gene pairs are between protein complexes while a further three gene pairs are between genes involved in the same pathway - this indicates the presence of a layer of 'redundancy' for the enzyme or pathway that confers protection against a single-target therapy. moreover, three of the genes involved in gene pairs are known to be essential for virulence, but not for growth, and have known inhibitors based on brenda  <cit> . this structured overview of in silico synthetic lethal gene pairs identified numerous candidate drug targets many of which have known inhibitors. in subsequent studies, these model-generated hypotheses need to be tested and validated.

additional gene products shown to play a central role in virulence yet are not essential for growth in laboratory conditions or do not have an unequivocal functional annotation represent additional therapeutic targets. these gene products could serve as potential points for manipulating host metabolism  <cit> , could be essential for metabolism in the host environment  <cit> , and will represent an energy and materials demand when creating integrated metabolic and expression reconstructions  <cit> . recent examples of relevant gene products that have not been annotated but are crucial for virulence include gene products stm3117-stm <dig>  <cit> ; as the metabolic functions of unannotated genes are elucidated, they will need to be incorporated into future revisions of the mr.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the community-developed consensus mr is a curated reconstruction with the combined properties of the starting mrs and new information that was added during and after the reconstruction jamboree. the expanded metabolic versatility with a focus on virulence, updated annotation, including corrections, and curation of hundreds of additional reactions, genes, and metabolites by a community of experts present in stm_v <dig>  highlights the value of a community-based approach. another mr for s. typhimurium was published after the jamboree  <cit> , which was also based on an e. coli mr <cit> . the reconciliation with this third mr will need to be done in subsequent jamboree meetings, which will also lead to a further expansion of knowledge and data included in the consensus knowledge-base. the publication of the third mr for s. typhimurium emphasizes the importance and the value of the effort presented in this report as well as the need for additional outreach when assembling jamboree committees.
