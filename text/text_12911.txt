BACKGROUND
fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe is a popular model organism for fundamental biological research  <cit> . a haploid life cycle along with efficient homologous recombination system and simple reproductive processes make it an excellent system to study genetics. in yeast, genes can be deleted and replaced with selection markers readily, simply by inducing homology directed repair with a selection cassette amplified with primers that contain short, flanking sequences homologous to a target gene  <cit> . a strain of induced genotype can be isolated simply by plating transformants onto corresponding selection plates. generated strains can be further crossed to isolate multiple genetic alternations that can be selected for using combination of appropriate markers.

in fission yeast, commonly used drug selection cassettes are kanmx <dig>  natmx <dig>  hygmx <dig>  and blemx <dig>  <cit> . these cassettes are composed of a promoter and terminator from the fungus ashbya gossypii and genes conferring selectable resistance to g <dig> , nourseothricin , hygromycin b and bleomycin respectively. auxotrophic gene cassettes, such as ura4
+ from s. pombe and leu <dig> from saccharomyces cerevisiae have also been extensively used in fission yeast  <cit> . however, when using auxotrophic cassettes, strains must have mutations in the corresponding endogenous gene, which could affect cell metabolism, stress response and cell growth. thus, use of antibiotic resistance markers has become standard for yeast organisms, as the working strain does not require any particular auxotrophic genetic background. however, as these antibiotic cassettes all share the same promoter and terminator sequences, it is difficult to perform sequential gene targeting due to the shared homology  <cit> . this issue is usually solved by genetic cross between two mutant strains. however, this strategy is not feasible for mutants dysfunctional in mating, meiosis or germination. in some cases the mating is successful, but it is difficult to obtain desired genotype in the offspring if genetic distance is too close or if desired genotypes are not associated with selectable marker or not readily isolated by the marker. importantly, genetic crossing also mixes epigenetic status of genome. for example, telomere length will change if strains harboring distinct mean length of telomeres are crossed. these risks are avoidable when sequential gene targeting is performed. therefore, ura4
+, arg3
+ and his3
+ and leu <dig> cassettes are still used, as these auxotrophic markers contain their own distinct promoters and terminators .

the recently developed genome editing technology, crispr  and cas <dig> , has become available to use in fission yeast  <cit> . in this system, the cas <dig> nuclease is targeted to specific regions of genomic dna by its crispr rna component, a so-called guide rna that binds to the target dna, resulting in cas9-mediated dna double-strand breaks  at the target genomic locus. this system does not require selection cassettes, as cells confer constitutive dna dsbs until the target dna sequence is lost or altered. because a selection cassette is not required, this method is ideal for the sequential targeting of multiple genes/loci; in particular for gene disruption and for introducing point mutations or insertions using a designed dna repair template. however, although the crispr/cas <dig> strategy is widely used for genetic engineering in animals and humans, the use of this method to mutate genes in fission yeast currently holds a number of limitations. it is often necessary to design a number of guide rnas, which need to be cloned into a fission yeast crispr/cas <dig> plasmid  <cit> . target sequences must be unique,  <dig> bases long, and are limited to loci upstream of a protospacer adjacent motif . this means that the designed dna repair template will recombine only at the dsb site, and the substitution of the designed point mutation needs to be close to the dsb site  <cit> . it is also noted that adenine and thymine rich sequences cannot be targeted. hence, whereas gene disruption, single point mutations and insertions are relatively straightforward for the crispr/cas <dig> method, replacement of a large genomic dna region with the designed dna template, such as wide range multiple mutagenesis of the whole gene sequence  <cit> , is not feasible. thus, traditional homologous recombination-based genetic engineering remains the most robust method to perform genetic manipulations in fission yeast.

here, we report optimization of the classical pcr-based targeting method by modification of well-known mx <dig> markers, which enables sequential knock in/out genes of interest. we also generated the c-terminal tagging vectors for pcr-based gene targeting. in addition, we generated counter selectable drug resistance markers by fusing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase  with antibiotic resistance genes. this can replace the traditionally used counter-selectable ura4
+ cassette. furthermore, introduction of irreversible mutant loxp -over p1) sites allows recycling of selection cassettes. finally, using the generated constructs, we report a reliable two-step mutagenesis method, suitable for mutagenesis of essential genes. altogether, we have demonstrated innovative techniques that address current difficulties in the construction of required fission yeast strains.

RESULTS
cassettes for pcr-based sequential targeting
although pcr-based gene targeting by drug selection markers is the conventional approach, it is not efficient if a transforming strain already contains other drug selection markers. all mx <dig> cassettes share 300 bp of the tef promoter and 200 bp of the tef terminator, which are significantly larger than the 80–100 bp sequences introduced in primers to target genes of interest. therefore, there is a high chance of recombination between the mx <dig> cassettes  <cit> . in order to overcome this problem, cmvneo and cmvzeo cassettes  were cloned to replace the mx <dig> cassette of the plasmid pfa6a-kanmx <dig>  <cit> . resulting plasmids, pfa6a-neocv and pfa6a-zeocv, contain neomycin/kanamycin and zeocintm resistant genes, respectively, flanked by the cytomegalovirus promoter  and the simian virus  <dig> terminator  . these cassettes share only  <dig> bases of the primer annealing sites with the mx <dig> cassettes, which reduces the risk of unwanted recombination between selection markers. in addition, the tef promoter in the natmx <dig> cassette, which provides resistance to nourseothricin , was replaced with the cmv promoter , resulting in the plasmid named pfa6a-natcx. the tef terminator of the hygmx <dig> cassette, which provides resistance to hygromycin b , was replaced with either the tsv <dig> terminator or the s. cerevisiae leu <dig> terminator , resulting in the plasmids named pfa6a-hygmv and pfa6a-hygml, respectively . the zeocv cassette acts as an equivalent to blemx <dig>  <cit> , and provides resistance to zeocintm, bleomycin and phleomycin . we confirmed that replacement of the promoter or terminator did not impair the function of the drug resistant cassettes. thus, the newly generated selection cassettes can be used as an alternative to existing mx <dig> cassettes.fig.  <dig> selection markers for sequential gene targeting. a schematic representation of sequential targeting cassettes pfa6a-neocv, pfa6a-zeocv, pfa6a-natcx, pfa6a-hygmv and pfa6a-hygml. the region used as a pcr template is shown. the  <dig> base top  primer anneals to the left end  and bot primer anneals to the right end to amplify indicated cassettes . the  <dig> base primers used in this study are listed in table  <dig>  cyan arrows represent diagnostic primers used for screening of correct targeting . sequences of primers are shown in table  <dig>  backbone vector region  encodes ampicillin resistant cassette and cole <dig> bacteria replication origin, and the cassettes were inserted between paci and pmei sites. black box and black arrow in the cassette represent indicated promoter and terminator, respectively. white box in neocv and zeocv indicates the em <dig> promoter for e. coli. the size of the cassette is shown on the left. transcription direction is toward left for neocv and zeocv cassettes and toward right for other cassettes. b wild-type and rdh54∆ cells in which the zeocv cassette replaced rdh <dig> were cultured in yes rich media, normalised and serially diluted. five microliter of diluted fractions were spotted on yes  or yes containing 100 μg/ml of zeocintm and incubated at 32 °c for 3 days. only cells containing the zeocv cassette grew on yes with zeocin. deletion of the rdh <dig> gene required for meiosis does not impair cell growth and mitotic dna damage repair. c cells carrying kanmx <dig> or natmx <dig> cassettes were transformed with hygmv  or hygmx <dig>  and selected for on yes plates containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin . eighteen and  <dig> colonies that were randomly picked for hygmv and hygmx <dig> transformations respectively, were re-streaked on yes plates containing 100 μg/ml hyg . cells were then replica-plated to yes plates containing 100 μg/ml hyg plus either 100 μg/ml g <dig>  or 100 μg/ml clonnat  . in case of hygmv transformation, all transformed cells retained resistance to g <dig> and clonnat, whereas in case of hygmx <dig>  only seven out of  <dig> did





using the generated cassettes, we tested if they could be used for sequential gene deletion. two genes, crb2
+ and rdh54

, the hygmv cassette was amplified by pcr using the crb <dig> 100 bp primer set  and pfa6a-hygmv plasmid as a template. a strain bearing both kanmx <dig> and natmx <dig> [h

+] was transformed with the crb2::hygmv pcr fragment, and the transformant colonies were selected for resistance to hygromycin b . the presence of kanmx <dig> and natmx <dig> cassettes was determined by resistance to g <dig> and clonnat , respectively. the hygmv cassette was therefore successfully integrated into the genome without recombining with the mx <dig> cassettes present, conferring resistance to multiple antibiotics . deletion of crb <dig> by hygmv was confirmed by diagnostic pcr using a forward primer within the hyg
r gene and a reverse primer downstream of crb <dig> . in contrast, transformation with the crb2::hygmx <dig> pcr fragment resulted in replacement of kanmx or natmx <dig> markers, assessed by gain of sensitivity to g <dig> and nat, respectively . next, the rdh54
+ gene was deleted in a similar fashion, using a rdh54::zeocv fragment generated by pcr using the rdh <dig> 100 bp primer set and pfa6a-zeocv plasmid as a template. like hygmv, zeocv did not recombine with any of existent marker cassettes . the rdh <dig> deletion in the resulting strain [h

hsv-tk chimera selection markers
until recently, the ura4
+ auxotrophic marker was the only marker in the fission yeast system to be both selectable and counter-selectable. cells carrying ura4
+ gene can be eliminated by growing on media supplemented with 5-fluoroorotic acid , as ura <dig> converts 5-foa to toxic fluorodeoxyuridine  <cit> . alternatively, the thymidine kinase from herpes simplex virus  is available for use as a negative selection marker  <cit> . tk phosphorylates 5-fluoro-2’-deoxyuridine  to give 5-fluoro-2’-deoxyuridine-5-monophosphate . fdump blocks activity of thymidylate synthase, resulting in inhibition of 2’-deoxythymidine-5-triphosphate  synthesis, leading to loss of the dttp pool and cell death. hence, strains expressing a tk cassette cannot grow in the presence of fdu  <cit> . unlike the ura4
+ cassette, the tk cassette can be used with any genotype background. although fission yeast carrying the tk cassette are sensitive to fdu, a positive selectable marker is also needed in order to isolate cells carrying tk  <cit> . this issue was solved by a fusion of the tk gene with a positive selectable marker in mammalian systems  <cit> .

we decided to create fused selection markers for fission yeast, which express fusion antibiotic resistance genes with the tk gene that serve for both positive and negative selection by chemical treatments. we first inserted the tk gene upstream of the gene coding sequences in kanmx <dig> and natmx <dig>  giving tkanmx <dig> and tknatmx <dig>  to assess function of the fusion genes, the tk-fusion cassettes were inserted at the leu1
+ locus. as expected, cells carrying tkanmx <dig> and tknatmx <dig> were resistant to g <dig> and nat, respectively. however, these cells grew in the presence of 100 μg/ml fdu, suggesting that the fused tk gene is not functional . we speculated that the level of tk, expressed by the tef promoter, was not sufficient to convert fdu for a toxic amount of fdump, as previously published the tk cassette for fission yeast uses the stronger adh <dig> promoter  <cit> . we therefore replaced the tef promoter with a stronger cmv promoter , which indeed enhanced cells sensitivity to fdu . furthermore, an even greater sensitivity was obtained with replacement of the s. pombe adh <dig> promoter, giving tknatax . the success of this finding was reiterated with the tk-kan
r fusion gene, giving tkanax . cells carrying tkanax were fully resistant to g <dig> and displayed an intermediate sensitivity to fdu . finally, hsv-tk was inserted after the hyg
r gene coding sequence, similar to the hytk or hygr-tk fusion genes used in mammalian systems  <cit> , giving hytkax . cells carrying hytkax were resistant to hygromycin b and sensitive to fdu . in conclusion, fusions of the yeast antibiotic markers with the tk gene are functional, allowing both positive and negative selections of cells carrying the fusion cassettes.fig.  <dig> tk-fusion counter-selectable cassettes. a schematic representation of counter-selectable cassettes hytkax, tkanax and tknatax. region used as a pcr template is shown. the backbone vector is pfa6a and the cassettes were inserted between paci pmei sites. top primers anneal to the left end  and bot primer anneals to the right end to amplify indicated cassettes . cyan arrows represent diagnostic primers used for screening of correct targeting, and sequence of primers is shown in table  <dig>  the tk fusion genes are transcribed by the s. pombe adh <dig> promoter and terminated at the tef terminator. the size of the cassette is shown on the left. transcription direction is toward right. b, c and d fdu sensitivity of cells carrying the hsv-tk fusion cassettes. indicated cells were cultured in yes rich media, normalised and sequentially diluted five times. five microliter of diluted fractions were spotted on yes containing the indicated drugs and incubated at 32 °c for 3 days. b cells carrying the tknatax cassette are hyper sensitive to 20 μl/ml fdu. c cells carrying the tkanax cassette are sensitive to 100 μl/ml fdu. d cells carrying the hytkax cassette are sensitive to 20–100 μl/ml fdu




in yeast, low sensitivity to fdu is partially caused by poor uptake of thymidine. this problem can be overcome by ectopic expression of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter , which is highly efficient at the uptake of thymidine analogs  <cit> . however, this strategy requires cells to carry the ent expression cassette. toxicity of fdu in the presence of tk is caused by impaired deoxythymidine-5-monophosphate  synthesis and reduced dttp levels  <cit> . hence, we anticipated that reduction of the deoxynucleotide  pool by hydroxyurea  might further reduce the dttp level, leading to increased sensitivity to fdu. to test this possibility, cells carrying tknatax, tkanax and hytkax were spotted on yes media containing increasing concentrations of hu  along with 100 μg/ml fdu . the growth of cells carrying tkanax was significantly suppressed by fdu in the presence of hu, as represented by microcolonies. taken together, we recommend the following concentrations for fdu anti-selections: 20 μg/ml fdu for tknatax, 100 μg/ml fdu for hytkax and 100 μg/ml fdu plus 5 mm hu for tkanax.fig.  <dig> concomitant treatment with hu enhances sensitivity to fdu. indicated cells were cultured in yes, normalised and serially diluted five times with yes. five microliter of diluted fractions were spotted on rich media containing the indicated drugs and incubated at 32 °c for 3 days. cells carrying tkanax grew poorly in yes containing 5 mm hu and 100 μg/ml fdu




mutants defective in dna replication checkpoint and homologous recombination are sensitive to fdu
although the tk cassette is a useful tool, we have come across a number of fission yeast mutants that exhibited sensitivity to fdu while not containing the tk cassette. specifically, our data suggest that mutants defective in dna replication and dna damage response pathways are sensitive to fdu. it has previously been reported that rad3∆ cells, which lack the dna damage checkpoint protein rad <dig> , are sensitive to the deoxythymidine variant, 5’-ethyl-2’-deoxyuridine in the presence of tk  <cit> . surprisingly, we identified that rad3∆ cells that did not express tk were also sensitive to 20 μg/ml fdu . in response to dna damage and dna replication problems, rad <dig> activates chk <dig> and cds <dig>  respectively  <cit> . interestingly, cds1∆ cells were sensitive to 100 μg/ml fdu, whereas chk1∆ cells were only mildly sensitive to fdu . moreover, homologous recombination repair mutant rad54∆ cells also exhibited sensitivity to 100 μg/ml fdu . whilst rad <dig> is essential for homologous recombination, the rad55-rad <dig> complex acts in parallel to swi5-sfr <dig> and upstream of rad <dig>  <cit> . as such, rad55∆ cells exhibited only mild sensitivity. although it remains unclear how fdu can be converted to fdump under dna replication stress, our data suggest that mutants defective in dna replication and dna damage response pathways are sensitive to fdu. therefore, we recommend to test working strains for the sensitivity to fdu prior to performing counter-selection screening.fig.  <dig> 
rad3∆, cds1∆ and rad54∆ are sensitive to fdu. indicated cells were cultured in yes, normalised and  <dig> times sequentially diluted with yes. five microliter of diluted fractions were spotted on rich media containing the indicated drugs and incubated at 32 °c for 3 days. a
rad3∆ cells are hyper sensitive to 20 μg/ml fdu. b
cds1∆ and rad54∆ cells are sensitive to 100 μg/ml fdu. chk1∆ and rad55∆ cells are mildly but significantly sensitive to fdu, compared to wild type cells




the cre/loxp system can be utilized for the recycling of counter-selectable markers
another way to address the limited availability of selection markers is to recycle the cassette using the cre/loxp approach . in this system, cre recombinase recombines two short loxp sequence sites to generate crossover products. hence, a loxp-flanked  gene of interest or selection marker can be deleted via expression of cre recombinase. to generate conditional pop-out markers for tkanax, tknatax and hytkax, mutant variants of loxp sequences - lox <dig> and lox <dig> - were introduced at the start and end of the cassettes. resulting cassettes were named ftkanax, ftknatax and fhytkax, respectively . although the lox <dig> and lox <dig> sequences are substrates for cre recombinase, the crossover results in the generation of wild type loxp and double mutated loxp sequences; the latter is no longer recognized by the recombinase  <cit> . therefore, the scar of a lox71-lox <dig> recombined site will not crossover with a newly introduced loxp-containing marker in the genome.fig.  <dig> cre expression vector and loxp cassette. a schematic representation of loxp-flanked  tk-fusion cassettes fhytkax, ftkanax and ftknatax. region used as a pcr template is shown. forward direction of lox <dig> and lox <dig> sequences are inserted into the tk cassettes shown in fig. 2a. b schematic representation of pnxrva-hacre. fusion protein of three tandem ha epitope tag, nls  and cre recombinase is expressed by the constitutively active cmv promoter. kanmx <dig> is inserted between bglii and pmei sites. the genomic dna fragment containing the early replication origin ars <dig> is inserted downstream of the kanmx <dig> cassette. a number of unique restriction enzyme sites are indicated

we also generated a series of the cre expression vectors, encoding a fusion protein, comprised of the three tandem hemagglutinin  genes, a nuclear localization signal  sequence and cre recombinase , under the control of a cmv promoter . to maximize versatility, the cre expression vector carries a series of the selection markers; kanmx <dig>  tkkanax, hygmx <dig>  hytkax, natmx <dig>  tknatax or the aur
r cassette, which encodes gene resistance to aureobasidin a  <cit> , as well as auxotrophic markers, including ura4
+, arg3
+, leu1
+ and ade6
+ . altogether, a choice of three ‘floxed’ markers and a series of the cre expression vectors would maximize the utility for genome engineering.table  <dig> the cre-expression vectors

using the cre expression vector, the efficiency of the ftknatax cassette removal was assessed. cells carrying the ftknatax cassette were transformed with the cre expression vector, and were directly plated on fdu plates. total  <dig> colonies were formed on the fdu plate after cre expression, and all were lost the resistance to nat. ten clones were randomly selected and their loss of the ftknatax cassette was confirmed by pcr. thus, fdu counter selection along with cre expression efficiently eliminates cells retaining the ftknatax cassette.

tandem epitopes c-terminal tagging plasmids, pnx <dig> series
in addition to creating a series of plasmids useful for the sequential modification of genes, we have also created similar plasmids for c-terminal tagging of gene products. tandem repeats of epitope tags enhance the detection efficiency of target proteins, which is important for their visualization, especially if they have low-abundance. however, larger tags can potentially interfere with protein function. therefore, the size of the tag needs to be optimized for each protein of interest. to address this, three tandem genes coding for either ha, pk  and flag epitopes, flanked by nhei and xbai restriction sites were synthesized, and cloned between paci and asci sites of the pfa6a-kanmx <dig> c-terminal tagging plasmid  <cit>  . pcr-based amplification of the c-terminal tagging plasmid for gene targeting results in addition of a peptide - arg-ile-pro-gly-leu-ile-asn-ala-ser - which acts as a linker between the target protein and the epitopes . the resulting plasmids were named pnx <dig> .fig.  <dig> the cooh-terminus tagging plasmid. a schematic representation of pnx3a-ha <dig> and sequence of three tandem ha and multi cloning sites. the ha encoding gene is inserted between paci asci sites. the  <dig> base tag primer anneals to the left end  and bot primer anneals to the right end to amplify indicated cassettes . a number of unique restriction enzyme sites are indicated. b sequence of three tandem pk  and flag  fragments. pnx3a-pk <dig> and pnx3a-fl <dig> plasmids were generated by replacing ha <dig> sequence between nhei and xbai sites in pnx3a-ha <dig>  with indicated pk and flag sequences, respectively. c detection efficiency of pk-tagged tpz <dig>  western blot shows detection of pk epitope fused tpz <dig>  no obvious non-specific bands were detected. proteins were extracted from cells and subjected to sds-page. anti-v <dig> antibody  was used to detect pk fused tpz <dig> protein. anti-cdc <dig> antibody   was used as a control for loading. d telomere length homeostasis is slightly impaired with the nine tandem pk tagging of tpz <dig>  genomic dna was harvested from cells cultured over 2 weeks after generation of strains, and digested with ecori and separated in 1 % agarose gel. telomere containing fragments were detected with the synthetic telomeric dna probe




the pnx <dig> plasmid series was extended by replacing kanmx <dig> with other drug resistance cassettes  or ura4
+ cassette. the cleavage site of nhei is compatible with that of xbai, which allows ligation of epitope tags. for example, 3xpk can be sequentially subcloned to generate 6xpk, 9xpk and 12xpk-tagging plasmids. a list of the pnx <dig> plasmid series created is shown in table  <dig>  all plasmids were verified by dna sequencing, and some of the constructs have been used elsewhere  <cit> .table  <dig> the c-terminal tagging vectors, pnx <dig> series

: neocv and zeocv cassettes are inserted in reverse direction




using pk-tagging plasmids from this series and the tpz <dig> tag and bot  <dig> base primer set, we successfully inserted the gene encoding three, six, nine and  <dig> tandem-repeats of the pk epitope at the end of the coding gene of tpz1
+ to endogenously express tpz <dig> with the pk tagged at the c-terminus . tpz <dig> is a component of telomere shelterin complex and is a homolog of human tpp <dig>  tpz <dig> both positively and negatively regulates telomere length by interacting with different factors  <cit> . one interacting partner binds to the c-terminal ends of tpz <dig>  which is required for formation of shelterin to suppress telomere elongation . deletion of tpz <dig> leads to telomere deprotection and cell death  <cit> . as expected, the efficiency of detection of tpz <dig> was increased with a number of pk repeats, and the observed difference in band sizes was due to a different number of 3xpk repeats in each sample . the slower migrating band in each lane, that presumably corresponds to sumoylated tpz <dig>  <cit> , also became readily detectable . to determine whether the c-terminal fusion of pk-tags impaired the activity of tpz <dig>  we measured telomere length of cells bearing tpz <dig> fused to a different number of repeats of pk epitopes . whereas three and six tandem pk tags did not affect telomere length homeostasis, nine tandem pk tags led to slightly elongated telomeres. thus, we conclude that, although larger tags make proteins and their modifications more visible, they may increase the risk of interfering with function.

two-step transformation for gene editing at the endogenous locus
a traditional two-step method can utilize the ura4
+ cassette to introduce point mutations  <cit> . first, the gene of interest is replaced by the ura4
+ cassette in a strain where the endogenous ura4
+ gene region has been deleted . next, the inserted ura4
+ cassette is replaced with the mutagenized gene allele. the successfully transformed cells, which lost ura4
+, are initially selected using 5-foa. we previously utilized this method with success to mutagenize the rap <dig> gene  <cit> . this strategy requires the ura4-d <dig> mutation in the strain and further epitope tagging may be necessary to determine the stability of the mutant product downstream. to mutagenize essential genes, a diploid strain should be used in which only one allele of the target gene is replaced with the ura4
+ cassette. however, because the wild type allele has better homology, the targeting construct favors the wild type allele over the deleted allele. thus, although treatment with 5-foa can reduce occurrence of false positives, the presence of the wild type allele makes difficult to target the ura4
+ replaced locus in diploid cells.

to address this issue, we propose a new method, which utilizes anti-selection markers. in this method, the gene of interest is replaced with a negative selection cassette from the tk-fusion series. the second step uses a plasmid from the pnx <dig> series to introduce the desired modification to the gene. briefly, the gene of interest together with its endogenous promoter is subcloned into a pnx <dig> plasmid and mutagenized as desired. the tk-fusion cassettes contain the tef terminator but not the tef promoter. the shared homology between the tef terminator and the promoter region of the gene in the pnx <dig> plasmid and the tknat/kan cassettes permits insertion of the modified gene at the deleted allele via homology directed repair.

as an example, we utilized this method to introduce point mutations in the tpz1
+ gene. as tpz1
+ is essential gene, we first deleted one tpz <dig> allele in a diploid strain using the pcr-based tknatcx recombination method . the cloned tpz1
+ in the pnx3a-3ha plasmid  was mutagenized at the position c.322– <dig> to give the mutation k75a. the resulting construct, pnx3a-tpz1-k75a-ha <dig>  was digested with the restriction enzymes, and the tpz <dig> heterozygous diploid strain was transformed with this targeting construct . the resulting transformants were selected by g <dig> resistance. most of the positive colonies lost their nat resistance as successful insertion of the mutant gene would result in removal of the tknatcx cassette. in our experience, success rate of the gene replacement was 96 % . diagnostic pcr using primer sets shown in fig. 7c confirmed that all of the transfomants that lost nat resistance had the correct replacement of tpz1-3xha:kanmx <dig> at the tknatcm site. expression of tpz1-3xha was confirmed by western blot. finally, the resulting heterozygous diploid strain -3xha:kanmx6/+) was starved to induce sporulation, and the offspring was selected on the g <dig> to isolate a tpz <dig> haploid strain. expression level, function of tpz <dig>  and the phenotype of this mutant strain were reported previously  <cit> . therefore we showed that this method can be successfully and reliably used to target and modify genes to give stable products.fig.  <dig> two-step mutagenesis. schematic diagram of the two-step gene replacements and induction of point mutation of the tpz <dig> gene. list of diagnostic primers is shown in table  <dig>  a pcr based tpz <dig> gene deletion by the tknatcx targeting fragment generated using the tpz <dig> top and bot  <dig> base primer set . 80– <dig> base of homologous sequences in the  <dig> base primer set targets 5’ and 3’ utr regions of tpz1

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that the replacement of promoter and/or terminator sequences in drug resistance cassettes can eliminate the need to replace existing markers in working strains. this enables sequential genetic manipulations to be performed without making changes to the genetic and epigenetic background of strains. in addition, we have shown that the tk-fusion markers can be used to replace genes and subsequently swapped in order to counter-select for undesirable genotypes. while pcr-based gene targeting remains a powerful and cost-effective method, the modified plasmids and optimized techniques presented in this study would enable researchers to perform their desired genetic manipulations more efficiently and reliably.
