BACKGROUND
urothelial cancer  is a heterogeneous disease with risk factors that include smoking, contact to chemicals and age  <cit> . urothelial tumors originate from the epithelial lining of the bladder and can progress from non-invasive to more aggressive muscle-invasive subtypes which penetrate the deeper tissue layers of the bladder. the non-invasive tumor stages can be treated by transurethral resection, chemo- and intravesical therapy, whereas for invasive stages cystectomy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are preferred  <cit> . monitoring of uc is very expensive as its recurrence rate is high  <cit> . an understanding of the mechanistic interplay between individual genes and proteins that drive the development and progression of uc is therefore a high priority. system-based approaches allow us to investigate the underlying network structure associated with carcinogenesis and thus facilitate a novel perspective for the identification of molecular targets that drive urothelial carcinogenesis. the inference of gene regulatory networks  from large-scale gene expression data of tumor samples from various grades and stages is a promising approach for the identification of novel putative targets in cancer  <cit> .

a grn is a mathematical description of the dependencies within a gene expression dataset. currently, a large arsenal of gene regulatory network inference methods have been developed  <cit> . the most popular methods are based on mutual information which is a dependency measure that can be estimated for all pairs of genes in a gene expression dataset. in this study we infer grns by the application of the bc3net algorithm which is based on the aggregation of an ensemble of c3net gene regulatory networks  <cit> . the c3net algorithm selects a maximum of one gene neighbor for each gene on the basis of the strongest mutual dependency that is statistically significant. for a gene expression dataset with n genes we thus obtain a sparse network with at most n interactions. the bc3net generates an ensemble of c3net networks from bootstrap datasets, i.e., by sampling a dataset with replacement, that are subsequently aggregated to a weighted network. we have reported that bc3net was shown to produce biological meaningful results  <cit> . the hub genes of grns that were inferred from large-scale cancer gene expression data were observed to provide promising putative novel target genes for cancer such as g-protein coupled receptors and transmembrane proteins  <cit> .

methods
preprocessing and sample information for the illumina rnaseq, bead array and affymetrix oligo microarray gene expression dataset
we preprocessed three large-scale urothelial cancer gene expression datasets from a) illumina rnaseq   <cit> , b) illumina bead array  gse <dig>  <cit>  and c) affymetrix oligo microarray  platform  <cit> . an overview of the tumor stage information for the three datasets is shown in table  <dig>  in this table we distinguish  <dig> tumor stages, namely, ptcis, pta, pt <dig>  pt <dig>  pt <dig> and pt <dig>  for each of these stages we list the number of available samples provided by the three platforms.tumor stages across the three datasets



tumor stage
rnaseq
bead
oligo



the rnaseq dataset consists mainly of muscle-invasive uc tumor samples.  <dig> samples of the oligo dataset corresponded to the muscle invasive stages pt <dig> to pt <dig> and were not assigned a specific stage.



rnaseq gene expression dataset from tcga
the rnaseq gene expression dataset was retrieved from the cancer genome atlas bladder cancer tcga project   <cit> . we used the preprocessed rnaseqv <dig> normalized count expression values based on rsem   <cit>  as provided by tcga and clinical information such as the tcga barcode identifier, sample type and tumor histology by the bcr_aliquot_uuid identifiers. we extracted gene expression data of primary solid tumors for a total of  <dig> samples with histology stage information . a total of  <dig> of the  <dig> selected tumor samples represent muscle invasive carcinoma stage pt <dig> or above. we performed a log-transformation loge on the count expression values. the resulting gene expression matrix consisted of  <dig>  entrez genes and  <dig> samples. genes with a zero standard deviation were removed from the dataset.

illumina bead array gene expression dataset
we used the processed matrix series illumina bead gene expression data from geo gse <dig>  <cit> . the dataset comprises  <dig> samples from the illumina human- <dig> v <dig>  expression beadchip microarray platform. the dataset consists of tumor samples from  <dig> muscle invasive,  <dig> non-muscle invasive,  <dig> recurrent non-invasive bladder cancer and samples that we excluded for the network inference representing  <dig> mucosae surrounding cancer and  <dig> normal mucosae. we assigned illumina identifiers to entrez gene id and gene symbols using the illuminahumanv <dig> db annotation bioconductor package. from the  <dig>  illumina identifiers for a total of  <dig>  an entrez identifier was available. the remaining  <dig>  features were not considered for the analysis. in total, we selected  <dig> primary bladder cancer samples .

affymetrix oligo microarray gene expression dataset
we used a third uc dataset from affymetrix gene expression data comprising  <dig> samples from  <dig> different datasets. we extracted  <dig>  samples from gse <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  samples from gse <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  samples from gse <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  samples from gse <dig>  <cit> . we considered only probe sets that were present in both array types u133a and u133plus <dig>  we combined the u133plus <dig> samples and the u133a samples using the matchprobes bioconductor package  <cit> . we normalized the microarray samples using rma and quantile normalization  <cit>  using log <dig> expression intensities for each probe set. as a summary statistic for multiple probesets that match to the same entrez gene identifiers we used the median expression value. entrez gene id to affymetrix probe set annotation was obtained from the hgu133plus <dig> db and hgu133a.db r package. we excluded all probe sets from our analysis that remained unmapped to entrez identifiers. the resulting expression dataset consisted of  <dig>  genes and  <dig> samples.

bc3net gene regulatory network inference
we inferred our bladder cancer grn using c3net and the “b”agging version of the c3net  <cit>  algorithm called bc3net  <cit> . the bc3net infers an ensemble of c3net gene regulatory networks from bootstrap generated datasets that are subsequently aggregated to a weighted grn. we defined an ensemble of b= <dig> independent bootstrap datasets {dkb}k=1b that were generated from a given gene expression dataset d. for each bootstrap data set dkb a grn gkb was inferred using c3net  <cit> . edges with non-significant mutual information values were subsequently rejected using a non-parametric test with a bonferroni multiple testing correction for a significance level α= <dig> . the null distribution of mutual information is generated from sample-gene label permutations of the original gene expression matrix. for the network inference we used a pearson estimator  <cit> 
  i=−12log, 

where ρ denotes the pearson correlation coefficient. the inferred ensemble of grns {gkb}k=1b was aggregated into a weighted network gwb. the weights of the inferred interactions give the frequency how often an interaction was observed in the c3net network ensemble and are denoted as ensemble consensus rate . for each inferred weighted edge in the network the statistical significance was estimated by a binomial test. for multiple testing correction bonferroni was used with a significance level α= <dig> .

relevance networks
for the inference of relevance networks  <cit>  we used the wgcna r package  <cit>  and the clr  <cit>  implementation provided in the minet r-package  <cit> . interactions were defined for wgcna by hard thresholds on the absolute pearson correlation matrix and for clr by hard thresholds on the z-score transformed mutual information matrix that was estimated using a pearson estimator  <cit> .

cancer census genes
the cancer gene census   <cit>    provides information about genes with somatic mutations that are associated to different types of cancer. we used the entrez identifiers of the defined cancer census genes.

gene ontology gene sets
for our analysis, we obtained the gene ontology  <cit>  annotation for entrez gene ids from bioconductor  <cit>  annotation packages org.hs.eg.db and go.db.

gene family gene sets
we retrieved gene family protein tag information and entrez identifiers of the genes in the hgnc database . we defined gene family gene sets for groups of genes that shared the same hgnc protein family tag. from the hgnc database we gathered a total of  <dig> gene family gene sets comprising a total of  <dig>  entrez genes.

gene sets of co-localized adjacent genes
for the identification of genomic regions with enriched subnetworks of interacting genes we defined gene sets of genes that were adjacently located within a chromosomal region  from overlaping sliding windows along the human chromosomes. we defined gene sets from 1mb  sliding windows along the human chromosomes with a 500kb  overlap between adjacent windows. the gene sets of co-located genes were defined for chromosome regions of 1mb with 500kb overlap to mimic the extend for co-expressed gene clusters  <cit> .

gene pair enrichment analysis 
the gpea facilitates the identification and ranking of significant subnetworks of defined gene sets for a given network. for p genes there is a total of n=p/ <dig> different gene pairs. if there are ps genes for a particular gene set  then the total number of gene pairs for this gene set is ms=ps/ <dig>  when a network g contains n interactions, of which k interactions are among genes from the given gene set s, then a p-value for the enrichment of gene pairs of this gene set s can be calculated from the following hypergeometric distribution
  p=∑i=kmsp=∑i=kmsmsin−msn−inn 

this p-value gives an estimate for the probability to observe k or more interactions between genes from a given gene set s.

we performed a gpea analysis for the inferred grns for ∼  <dig>  gene sets of go biological process , ∼  <dig> gene sets of gene families  and ∼  <dig>  gene sets of co-located genes . for the analysis the inferred networks are expected to show a strong association to gene sets of a biological functional and spatial context. therefore, we considered a more stringent significance level of α= <dig>   relative to the number of performed test in the range of  <dig>  further, we considered a bonferroni multiple testing correction.

network centrality measures
for the network analysis we measured the degree centrality and edge density  <cit> . the degree centrality was defined as the total number of direct neighbors of a gene gi of an undirected gene regulatory network. the edge density of a network was the number of edges divided by the maximal number of possible edges. for an undirected network this number was given by n/ <dig>  whereas n is the total number of genes.

protein interaction databases
we gathered and processed interactions from biogrid  <cit>  , intact  <cit>  , mint  <cit>  , hprd  <cit>  , string  <cit>  . further, we considered the largest manually curated human signaling network  <cit>   which we denote in the text as singnet , a pathway protein interaction network extracted from the bioconductor package graphite  <cit>   and the integrative network from consensuspathdb   <cit>  . we assigned their entrez gene identifiers mapping when available from the interaction database or converted the identifiers  to entrez identifiers using the annotation from the bioconductor package org.hs.eg.db and uniprot database  <cit> .

quantitative comparison of experimental interactions in rnaseq, bead and oligo uc grn
we used the interactions from the biogrid, intact, mint, hprd, cpdb, singnet, graphite and string database seperately as global reference networks for the grn and measured the number of true, false positive , true, false negatives  and f-score to compare the performance of the three inferred gene regulatory networks. the f-score measure f=2prp+r gives a weighted average of the precision p=tptp+fp and recall r=tptp+fn.

for the local subnetwork based network inference performance comparisons we used the string network as a reference network. we compared the cumulative log transformed f-score distribution separately for commonly significant go biological process, genomic co-located genes and gene family subnetworks between the oligo, bead and rnaseq uc grns.

for all subnetworks and pairwise network comparisons we performed a hypergeometric test for the number of shared interactions between two networks is not larger than expected by random chance. for the subnetwork analysis we consider fdr multiple testing correction  <cit> .

RESULTS
urothelial cancer  gene regulatory networks 
for the identification of molecular targets for uc from a network-based perspective we inferred bc3net grns from rnaseq, bead and oligo uc gene expression datasets. the giant connected component of the inferred rnaseq uc grn consisted of  <dig>  genes, the bead uc grn of  <dig>  genes and the oligo uc consisted of  <dig>  genes . in the following we compared the global network and local structural properties between the three networks.


the global network properties among the three networks were highly similar. the edge density  of the oligo has a slightly higher edge density compared to the rnaseq and bead uc grn. the degree distribution of the uc grn follow a power law distribution with exponents αrnaseq= <dig> , αbead= <dig> αoligo= <dig> . the average shortest path length for all three networks was prnaseq= <dig> , pbead= <dig> , poligo= <dig>  genes .

on the local structural level of individual interactions we observed that the three networks are highly dissimilar. we performed a pairwise comparison and joint comparison of all three networks to quantify the number of shared interactions. the percentages of shared interactions were quantified from the union of all interactions of two networks and for the joint comparison from the union of all interactions of the three networks. the grn networks shared only a total of  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   interactions which corresponded to subnetworks among  <dig>  to  <dig>  genes. in total, we found that only  <dig>   interactions were shared across the three grns and corresponded to a subnetwork among  <dig>  genes. an overview of our gene expression data and inferred gene regulatory networks on the interaction level is shown in figure  <dig> 

functional analysis of the inferred oligo, bead and rnaseq uc grn
in this section we highlighted the key biological processes of the three uc grns and their association to known cancer genes and performed a comparative analysis between inferred grn, relevance and ppi networks. we identified the most prominent subnetworks for known biological processes of the inferred oligo, bead and rnaseq uc grn by a functional enrichment analysis for gene pairs . the association of the identified biological processes to known cancer hallmarks was quantified by a subsequent enrichment analysis of cancer census genes.

the gpea analysis was performed for gene onotology  biological process for all terms with ≥ <dig> and < <dig> genes. for the rnaseq uc grn we observed a total of  <dig> % significant go terms. in contrast, for the bead and oligo uc grn only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all tested go terms were significant figure  <dig>  for all grn networks we observed that 50% of the identified significant go terms were also enriched by cancer census genes. a total of 91% , 88%  and 93%  of the cancer genes were present in the selected set of significant gene ontology biological processes.

from all significant go terms that we identified  <dig>  go terms were common across the three uc grns. we observed a wide variety of common biological processes with a pronounced representation of immune related processes, cell cycle, catabolic processes such as proteolysis, chromatin organization, metabolism, cell adhesion, cell migration, cell differentiation and development including keratinization and angiogenesis. a complete list of the significant terms for the individual analyses is given in the additional file 1: tables s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig>  an overview of the functional landscape of the common significant terms among the grn networks is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

in order to evaluate our results we compared the fraction of cancer associated biological processes between the bc3net and c3net grn, wgcna and clr relevance networks and ppi networks from graphite, singnet and cpdb. the analysis was performed separately for the oligo, bead and rnaseq gene expression data. for the analysis we generated relevance networks by hard thresholds for  <dig>  to  <dig>  percentiles of the absolute correlation matrix  and the z-score transformed matrix . c3net inferred interactions were weighted by the respective mutual information value and for bc3net by the ensemble consensus rate . for c3net and bc3net the analysis was performed on the entire network and for an ensemble of hard thresholds ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  percentiles. figure  <dig> shows the fraction of biological processes that were identified from the gpea analysis  with a significant enrichment of cancer census genes. for all  <dig> datasets the bc3net showed the largest fraction of cancer associated significant biological processes . clr and wgcna showed a low performance on the oligo gene expression dataset  that is comparable to ppi networks. we also observed that clr shows a prominently improved performance compared to wgcna.


gene pair enrichment analysis of gene subnetworks of co-located genes
gene expression profiles that are influenced by genomic and epigenomic alterations can elucidate dependency structures of co-located genes and link to novel genomic target regions which are specific to urothelial cancer. in order to identify genomic cancer target regions with significant subnetworks in the rnaseq, bead and oligo grns we perfromed an enrichment analysis for gene pairs in gene sets from genome-wide  <dig> mb genomic regions of co-located genes.

we observed  <dig> % significantly co-located gene subnetworks for the rnaseq uc grn. in contrast, for the bead and oligo uc grn we identified only 2−3%. figure  <dig> shows the most prominent co-located gene subnetwork for the grns of the rnaseq, bead array and oligo uc dataset. for the three grns the top  <dig> chromosomal regions with a significant grn subnetwork are shown in tables  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . we reviewed the literature for the most prominent identified genomic region and their association to uc for each grn. for the rna-seq uc grn the most prominent gene subnetwork was located on chromosome locus 5q <dig>  and represents a protocadherin gene cluster. in uc, the loci 5q <dig> −q <dig> has been associated with losses in a low fraction of uc tumors  <cit> . in  <cit>  an epigenetic analysis was performed on free dna derived from blood serum samples from uc patients of the protocadherin pcdh <dig> an pcdh <dig>  the studies of  <cit>  showed that the methylation patterns of pcdh <dig> and pcdh <dig> were significantly associated with stage, grade, recurrence and tumor size. the 5q <dig>  locus was also described in wilms tumor to be epigentically silenced  <cit> . for the bead uc grn the most prominent co-located gene subnetwork was located on chromosome locus 8q <dig> . the 8q <dig>  locus is a common gain loci in multiple cancers and was also confirmed in multiple uc cell lines  <cit> . for the oligo uc grn the chromosome locus 1q <dig>  contained the most prominent co-located gene subnetwork. in  <cit>  a gain of 1q <dig>  was identified from free dna in urine samples from uc patients. further,  <cit>  validated a selected candidate pfnd <dig> that is located in 1q <dig>  in an independent set of urothelial cancer tumors. pfnd <dig> was significantly amplified and overexpressed and showed association to increasing stage and tumor grade.gpea analysis of  <dig> mb genomic regions gene sets for the rnaseq uc grn

gene pair enrichment analysis of gene family subnetworks
a gene family is a group of duplicated genes with similar biological functions or biochemical activities which often form gene clusters of genes with chromosomal co-location. in this section we performed a gpea for gene family gene sets and compared the results between the uc rnaseq, bead and oligo grns.

we found a total of  <dig> %  significant gene family subnetworks in the rnaseq grn , but only  <dig> %  for the bead uc grn  and  <dig> %  for the oligo uc grn were significantly enriched . however, we found a high agreement of the gene family subnetworks between our grns with a total pairwise overlap of 30−60% and among the three networks 25% of all identified gene family subnetworks . it is noteworthy that  <dig> % of the gene families identified by the bead and 82% of the gene families identified by the oligo network were also significantly enriched in the rnaseq grn. in total  <dig> gene families were identified across all three uc grns which described cd molecules, keratin proteins , protocadherins , kalikrein proteins , zinc-finger transcription factors, metallothioneins and the immunoglobulin superfamily. an overview of the significant gene families that were common across all three grns are shown in table  <dig> gpea analysis of gene family gene sets for the uc rnaseq, bead and oligo grn

bladder cancer grn degree centrality and hub genes
the identification of highly interactive central genes, i.e., hub genes of inferred and experimental network can provide promising targets for urothelial cancer. in this section we described individual hub genes of the gene regulatory network and review their functional role and relevance for the study of uc.

in order to compare the global structural properties of individual genes we performed a pairwise comparison of the degree centrality for  <dig>  genes that are present among the three networks. the pairwise comparisons of the gene degree centrality across the three networks showed only a weak correlation. the degree ranks showed a slightly higher correlation between the rnaseq and bead grn of r= <dig>   compared to r= <dig>   and r= <dig>  .

hub genes of gene regulatory networks were observed to be highly dataset specific. table  <dig> a, b, c shows the six most frequently observed hub genes for each of the inferred uc grns. in the following we describe the hub genes for which there is strong evidence for their relevance to cancer related properties. for example, the transmembrane protein hid <dig> that was observed as a major hubgene in the rnaseq grn is reported to be downregulated in multiple cancers  <cit> ; fer1l <dig> is a lncrna reported to be prominently downregulated in gastric cancer  <cit> , ttll <dig> is described as a candidate cancer gene  <cit> , rif <dig> has been described to have anti-apoptotic properties in dna repair  <cit>  and sbno <dig>  was reported in lung cancer  <cit> . for the uc bead grn, rnf <dig>  is a potential liver cancer ct antigen  <cit>  and tmed <dig> was observed to be upregulated in a nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line and described to act as a major immune system switch  <cit> . the oligo grn hubgene cyp4a <dig> was shown to promote angiogenesis and metastasis in lung cancer  <cit>  and slc38a <dig>  is a glutamine transporter and has been described as a marker for malignant glioma  <cit> .the six major hub genes for the rnaseq, bead and oligo uc grn

overlapped only for a single term, i.e., for the regulation of neuron differentiation . for the rnaseq and oligo grn we observed nine terms in agreement, e.g., g-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway , ion transport  and sensory perception . we observed that the average degree centrality of the networks with randomized gene labels was similar across the gene sets and independent of the number of genes of a gene set. however, our rnaseq dataset mostly considered muscle-invasive ucs and shows terms associated to invasiveness. the bead data comprised terms that were nuclear while the terms predicted from the oligo data were predominantly extracellular membrane associated.

quantitative comparison of experimental interactions in rnaseq, bead and oligo uc grn
in this section we quantified the extend of local and globally shared interactions between the inferred grns and ppi networks. we assessed the global extent of interactions from ppi databases that were present in the uc grns by comparing the entire grns networks to string, biogrid, hprd, intact, mint, graphite, cpdb and singnet .

as observed on the subnetwork level using all string interactions the f-scores between the rnaseq and the oligo uc grn were similar. in contrast the bead uc grn showed a lower f-score for all ppi databases compared to the rna-seq grn and bead grn .

further, we compared the relative quantity of ppi interactions for the identified significant subnetworks of the gene sets for biological processes, genomic co-located genes and gene families. to avoid the comparison to subnetworks with no known protein-protein associations we used string as reference as it was the largest collection of ppi interactions that we considered in our study. for each gene set we computed f-scores by comparing the corresponding subnetwork of the grn to the subnetwork of the string network reference. figure  <dig> shows the cumulative f-score distributions between the rnaseq, bead and oligo grn separately for the  <dig> go terms,  <dig> gene family subnetworks and  <dig> chromosomal  <dig> mb regions. in addition, we repeated the analysis for each grn  <dig> times using a reference subnetwork where the gene labels were randomized .


the average f-scores were highest for the subnetworks of genomic co-located genes  and for the gene family gene sets . the gene ontology gene sets had the lowest average f-scores compared to the genomic and gene family subnetworks  . the observations are in agreement with the global analysis for rnaseq and oligo grn, where the bead uc grn has the tendency to perform worse. however, the rnaseq uc grn shows the tendency for smaller p-values over the bead and oligo uc grn .

the reference network with randomized gene labels were significantly lower compared to the grn for all comparisons. the bead grn had the tendency to show a significantly lower mean f-score compared to the rnaseq and oligo grn for the gene ontology  and the genomic 1mb window subnetworks . for the gene family subnetworks we did not observe a significant difference among the three grn.

discussion
in this paper, we have presented novel perspectives and applications for the identification of uc molecular targets using grns. specifically, we performed a structural, functional and comparative analysis across three uc grns that were independently inferred from three large-scale rnaseq, bead and oligo gene expression datasets. our objective was to identify putative prognostic uc targets for a subsequent investigation in uc tumors on the basis of their enrichment in functional subnetworks and hub gene analysis. our results demonstrate that grns are highly dataset specific on the gene interaction level and showed large similarities across the functional subnetwork levels. the rnaseq based grn showed the most prominent functional enrichment and is thus the data type of choice for a network inference. the rnaseq and oligo grn showed a similar inference performance based on public interaction databases and outperformed the bead based grn.

on the structural level, the three inferred grns were observed to follow a power law distribution  <cit>  that is common for inferred and experimental biological networks  <cit> . our results demonstrated that the network structure at the gene level of grns are highly dependent on the individual gene expression dataset. on the gene interaction level the pairwise comparison between the networks showed only an overlap of 2% and only  <dig> % of all interactions are common among the three networks . there are three main explanations for this observation. the first reason is that the bc3net algorithm considers only the strongest interaction neighbors for each gene and is thus highly dependent on the search space of the genes that are included in the dataset. the second reason is that the variations caused by concordance differences of the expression are dependent on technical properties of the individual gene expression platforms and platform dependent data processing procedures. the third reason is that the datasets represent varying proportions of different tumor grades and stages from individual patients that represent a complex condition phenotype. further, gene expression profiles of tumor tissues are highly heterogeneous on the molecular and tissue level, i.e., tumor clonal variation within and between different patient samples  <cit> .

in  <cit>  a guilt-by-association approach was developped to predict molecular roles of genes with unknown functions. the “guilt-by-association” property of genes that are connected in a defined network can also be used for a functional enrichment analysis for gene pairs which have known functions and are involved in the same biological processes. we identified significant functional grn subnetworks by performing a gene pair enrichment analysis  for defined gene sets. we used the terminology gene pair enrichment analysis to distinguish the latter from the terminology for a gene-based enrichment analysis which has no structural constraint. the concept for the analysis was introduced from graph theory  <cit>  and has been developped and applied for the identification of significant protein complex and ontology gene sets in ppi and inferred networks  <cit> .

a total of  <dig> to 10% of all tested gene ontology biological process terms,  <dig> to 10% of gene sets of co-located genes and  <dig> to 20% gene family gene sets showed a significant subnetworks by the enrichment of inferred interactions . rnaseq based network showed more than twice the proportion of significant subnetworks compared to the bead and oligo microarray based grn. our results showed in a quantative manner that rnaseq is beneficial for grn inference compared to bead and oligo microarray based data. the major advantages of rnaseq are more accurate measurement of the dynamic range of low and highly expressed genes  <cit>  and thus gives a better resolution of the underlying functional dependency structure between the genes.

in contrast to the low similarity that was observed between the grns on the structural interaction level, we observed high similarities on the functional subnetwork level . the fraction of significant biological process gene ontology terms that were common across the three uc grn was above 55%. for the gene family subnetworks we observed a similarity for  <dig> % and the lowest percentage for genomic co-located gene subnetworks  <dig> % .

the networks described a prominent enrichment for known cancer hallmarks  <cit>  with significant go subnetworks related to immune response, cell cycle, signal transduction, dna repair, translation, proteolysis, metabolic terms such as respiration and cell morphogenesis, adhesion and migration. further, over 50% of the significant go subnetworks were highly enriched by known cancer genes defined by the cosmic cancer census  <cit>  across the three uc grns. we observed that the fraction of cancer associated subnetworks is prominently lower in relevance network inference methods. this may result from low dependency measures of relevant interactions of genes in a more complex context being excluded from a relevance network by a global threshold. for other grn inference methods we expect similar results to the results presented by the bc3net that is based on the c3net. a c3net infers a core structure of a grn and thus infers only a subnetwork of other grn inference methods based on mutual information  <cit> . for each gene in a c3net at most one gene neighbor with strongest mutual dependency is selected, which results in a highly reduced time complexity for multiple testing of mutual information. the c3net and bc3net grns inference method is therefore less time consuming which makes the inference of very large grns  feasible in a reasonable time.

on the genomic level, the grns were investigated for genomic uc targets, where we identified genomic regions with known diagnostic and prognostic properties for urothelial cancer such as 1q <dig>   <cit>  , 8q <dig>   <cit>   and 5q <dig>   <cit>  . the identified genomic regions can link to chromosomal aberrations, histone modifications, changes in epigenetic regulation , regulatory elements and spatial chromosome organization in the nucleus. these processes are commonly deregulated in cancer. for example the impairment of dna repair mechanisms leads to an accumulation of chromosomal aberrations that are frequently observed in the progression of uc  <cit> . the identification of subnetworks of genomic regions from co-located genes therefore provided a powerful tool to identify putative novel genomic targets from cancer gene expression datasets.

in the analysis of gene families we found cd molecules as the most prominent gene family. cd molecules are promising targets for novel cancer immunotherapies such as cd <dig>  <cit> . some popular uc biomarkers target proteins of an entire gene family and not a single gene product such as keratins  <cit>  and kalikrein proteins  <cit>  which are popular tumor markers for uc. gene families are crucial in cancer research  <cit>  because they represent groups of genes that are functionally highly redundant and represent potential targets of the underlying molecular heterogeneity that is observed for malignant processes. we showed that the identification and ranking of functional and co-located gene sets and gene families using our gpea on grns is a versatile approach for the generation of novel targets and molecular understanding of the properties of urothelial cancer from the perspective of large-scale tumor tissue gene expression data.

hub genes of grns reflect the most prominent dependencies of the expression profile to a large number of genes. we identified hub genes such as hid <dig>  <cit>   rnf <dig>   <cit>  , cyp4a <dig>  <cit>   for the individual grns which show in the literature strong evidence for cancer related diagnostic and prognostic properties. further, we performed a degree centrality analysis of the grns that showed that the degree centrality of the genes allow to target promising mediators of cancer related cellular activities and signaling processes.

in addition, we performed a quantitative comparison of protein interactions for the rnaseq, bead and oligo uc grns. we note that the overlap for protein interaction data and grns is expected to be low and non-random. for example the most prominent ppi interactions that can be found in a grns are physical interactions of genes corresponding to large protein complexes  in contrast to more transient protein interactions  <cit> . a grn is inferred from gene expression data and thus can only detect indirect association to the protein level of a gene network. however, the analysis allowed to compare network properties between the oligo, bead and rnaseq data and pointed to the tendency that oligo expression data should be prefered over bead expression data for a grn inference.

CONCLUSIONS
on the functional and structural level our results demonstrated that rnaseq based data is the preferred data type for a grn inference. grns are highly dataset-specific at the interaction level, while at the global functional level they are highly similar. grn inference is a powerful tool to provide a database of novel uc targets that can be studied for prognostic and diagnostic clinical applications  <cit> .
