BACKGROUND
most eukaryotic cells sense motogenic signal gradients in their microenvironments and respond through cell polarization  <cit>  and expand a single lamellipodium to establish directional migration  <cit> . switching from the stationary state of the cell to the mobile state as in wound healing, gastrulation or metastasis depends on the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> .

migration and invasiveness of cancer cells is the hallmark of malignancy  <cit> . cell migration is a highly integrated multistep process that includes development of cytoplasmic protrusions, attachment and traction  <cit> . the formation of these protrusions is driven by spatial and transient regulation of actin polymerization at the leading edge of polarized migratory cells  <cit> . actin filament  dynamics are regulated by actin binding proteins  which are responsible for polymerization and treadmilling  <cit> . one of the most important families of abps is the adf/cofilin  family of proteins  <cit> .

vertebrates express three isoforms of adf/cofilin encoded by three different genes: actin depolymerizing factor , also known as destrin in mammals, non-muscle cofilin- <dig> , and cofilin- <dig> , which is enriched in muscle cells  <cit> . human adf and cofilin- <dig> are more than 70% identical in amino acid sequence  <cit> . at low concentrations with respect to actin subunits, adf and cofilin- <dig> sever the filaments, but at higher concentrations they bind cooperatively to saturate f-actin and stabilize the severed fragments  <cit> . also, adf/cofilin depolymerize f-actin from the pointed end leading to enhancement of treadmilling  <cit> . adf-actin has a much higher critical concentration for assembly than does cofilin-actin  <cit> , and thus adf but not cofilin can serve as a major monomer sequestering protein  <cit> .

metazoan adf/cofilins are regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of a conserved serine   <cit> . known kinases are lim kinases limk <dig>  limk <dig>  and testicular kinases tesk <dig> and tesk <dig>  <cit> . the more specific cofilin phosphatases are chronophin and slingshot   <cit> . ac proteins are ph-dependent in their interactions with f-actin  <cit> .

most research on adf/cofilin proteins in metastatic invasion has focused on cofilin- <dig> . although adf and cofilin can substitute for one another for many housekeeping activities in cultured cells  <cit> , this is not the case during development. cofilin null mice are not viable despite the fact that adf is upregulated  <cit> . in contrast, adf null mice are viable but show abnormal corneal thickening, suggesting that cofilin can rescue the lack of adf except in corneal epithelial cells  <cit> . however, in ureteric bud  epithelium, adf and cofilin show considerable functional overlap, whereas simultaneous lack of both genes arrested branching morphogenesis at an early stage  <cit> . likewise, most forms of adf and cofilin from across phylogeny are able to compete similarly with myosin ii for f-actin binding  <cit> .

silencing cofilin in colorectal cancer cells  did not interfere with their ability to undergo transwell migration across collagen in response to a chemotactic attractant. on the other hand, silencing of adf, which represented only 17% of the total adf/cofilin, significantly inhibited transwell migration, strongly suggesting different cellular functions of each protein in these cells  <cit> .

several studies have demonstrated an increase in cofilin amounts or in activity  in cancer cells including cell lines derived from t-cell lymphoma  and carcinomas from the cervix , colon , liver  and kidney   <cit> , and in clinical tumor samples of oral squamous-cell carcinoma  <cit> , renal cell carcinoma  <cit>  and ovarian cancer  <cit> . in addition, overexpression of cofilin increases velocity of cell migration in dictyostelium <cit>  and human glioblastoma cells  <cit> . expression of wildtype or a non-phosphorylatable cofilin mutant in which ser  <dig> has been mutated to alanine  increases melanoma cell invasion  <cit> .

however, opposite findings have also been reported. limk  <dig> activity, which should decrease active cofilin, is upregulated in invasive breast and prostate cancer cell lines and its overexpression increased motility of tumor cell lines  <cit> . furthermore, suppression of limk <dig> in human fibrosarcoma cells or expression of a dominant negative limk <dig> in an animal model of tumor invasion, limited cell migration and efficiency to form dense colonies without affecting cell proliferation rate or viability  <cit> . such opposite findings suggest that targets of limk <dig> and limk <dig>  which include adf as well as cofilin  <cit> , bring about different effects, which could be dependent on relative amounts of adf or cofilin that are expressed in the different tumor cell types.

mtln <dig> mammary adenocarcinoma cells have been used extensively in the study of metastasis. in breast tumor microenvironments, gradients of egf secreted by tumor associated macrophages  act as chemo-attractants leading to cancer cell polarization toward egf  <cit> . egf binds to egf receptor  on the surface of mtln <dig> cells leading to the activation of phospholipase cγ  and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases . adf/cofilin are bound to phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -bisphosphate  in the plasma membrane of resting mtln <dig> cells  <cit> . egf-activated plc-γ hydrolyzes pip <dig> causing the release of adf/cofilin from plasma membrane  <cit> . active adf/cofilin severs actin filaments creating new barbed ends that serve as nuclei for polymerization. new atp-actin or adp-pi-actin subunits are preferred by the arp2/ <dig> complex, which is responsible for creating the branched actin filament arrays at the leading edge of migrating cells forming cell protrusions needed for crawling  <cit> .

to study the roles of adf and cofilin in cancer cell migration, we selected mtln <dig> cells that expresses nearly identical amounts of each protein and silenced each in turn while performing a number of assays to assess the role of each in different aspects of polarized migration. our results suggest that whereas many of the functions of cofilin and adf are redundant, each of these isoforms has subtle functional differences that impact migratory cell behavior.

RESULTS
efficiency of infection of mtln3
mtln <dig> cells were infected for 72 h with adenoviruses for silencing adf or cofilin, or for expression of fluorescent proteins. in double infection experiments, one of the viruses expressed gfp, whereas the other virus expressed mrfp. after 72 h, the cells were fixed, and scored for percentage of infection. in single infection experiments,  <dig> % of the total cells expressed gfp while  <dig> % expressed mrfp. in double infection experiments,  <dig> % of the cells expressed gfp,  <dig> % expressed mrfp and  <dig> % expressed both gfp and mrfp. this demonstrates that the second virus infects in a cell autonomous manner .

adf and cofilin are equally expressed in mtln <dig> rat adenocarcinoma cell lines
we examined the levels of cofilin and adf  in mtln <dig> cell extracts by 2d western blots using a polyclonal antibody that recognizes adf and cofilin with equal sensitivity  <cit> . the lower adf spots do not appear when blots are developed using the cofilin monoclonal antibody mab <dig> . mtln <dig> cells express adf and cofilin equally , which prompted us to choose these cells to investigate the role of adf and cofilin during adhesion and migration.

sirna expression in mtln <dig> cells results in an efficient and specific reduction of cofilin and adf expression
to investigate the roles of adf and cofilin in the invasive phenotype of mtln <dig> cells, we used adenoviral mediated expression of hairpin rnas to generate specific silencing sirnas. western blots of extracts from mtln <dig> cells infected with adenovirus expressing either adf or cofilin sirna indicated that knock down  of greater than 90% was obtained by 72 h post-infection . adf in adf kd cells was reduced to 7% of controls  without effecting cofilin expression . similarly, cofilin in cofilin kd cells was reduced to 9% of controls without reducing adf expression . in the longer isocratic 15% acrylamide gels shown in figure 1b, the phosphorylated adf migrates above the adf band and below the band containing cofilin and phospho-cofilin, which migrate together. adf/cofilin levels in cells infected with adenovirus expressing a control non-silencing sirna  were not significantly different from uninfected controls , demonstrating that adenovirus infection per se had no effect on adf/cofilin expression. in all subsequent experiments, controls are cells infected with adenovirus expressing the non-silencing sirna.

since proteins of the adf/cofilin family have been shown previously to be involved in mitosis and cytokinesis  <cit> , and to validate the adenoviral silencing of adf and cofilin, we investigated certain mitotic parameters such as the mitotic index  , percentage of multinucleation  , and percentage of micronucleation  . as expected, the percentage of mitotic mtln <dig> cells was decreased in sirna-treated cells and both multinucleation and micronuclei formation increased as compared to the control infected cells .

adf and cofilin silenced cells are characterized by an elongated shape and smaller cell area
to investigate the effect of adf kd and cofilin kd on the morphology of mtln <dig> cells, we measured cell length, width, the ratio of length to width  and area of control and kd cells . the cell length of adf kd and cofilin kd cells increased significantly  while the cell width decreased significantly  when compared to the control cells. this in turn caused a significant increase in the l/w ratio  and a significant decrease in cell area in adf kd and cofilin kd cells  when compared to control infected cells .

data are expressed as mean ± sem, n ≥  <dig> cells in each experiment, three independent experiments. ***p <  <dig>  versus control.

adf and cofilin suppression affects mtln <dig> cell polarization after egf stimulation
to further analyze the impact of reducing adf or cofilin expression on mtln <dig> migratory morphology, control and kd cells were grown in starvation medium for 3 h and then were stimulated with  <dig> nm epidermal growth factor  for a period of  <dig> or 180 s, fixed, and stained with fluorescent-phalloidin. after imaging, cells were subdivided as having non-polarized or polarized morphology . we compared the percentage of polarized cells in each period of time after egf stimulation for control and treated mtln <dig> cells . adf kd and cofilin kd cells showed a significant increase over controls in polarized morphology before egf stimulation  that was maintained over 60 s of egf treatment . however, by 180 s of egf stimulation both adf kd and cofilin kd cells showed a significant decrease in percentage of polarization as compared to control cells  . thus, the ability of both adf kd and cofilin kd cells to polarize in response to global egf application is impaired.

for a more detailed analysis of the impacts of adf and cofilin on cell shape, polarized cells were subcategorized into crescent- or kite-shaped, while non-polarized cells were subcategorized into apolar; bipolar or multipolar  as described previously  <cit> . the percentage of cells in each category was scored in the control and kd cells . the majority of the polarized control cells exhibited the crescent-shape morphology over the time period of egf stimulation, whereas the kite shaped morphology was predominant in both adf kd and cofilin kd cells prior to egf addition. polarized adf kd and cofilin kd cells responded to egf stimulation by rapidly  changing their shape from kite to crescent; however, polarized egf-stimulated cofilin kd cells maintained a significantly higher percentage of kite-shaped cells over the entire time of egf exposure, suggesting a decreased ability to release adhesions in their tail . most of the non-polarized cells in control and both kd cell types had the apolar shape even after egf stimulation .

polarized and non-polarized cells were subcategorized as in figure 4a and the percentage of cells in each category was scored. data are expressed as mean ± sem, n ≥  <dig> cells in each experiment, three independent experiments. ***p <  <dig>  versus control.

changes in adf and cofilin phosphorylation following egf stimulation
the level of phospho-cofilin  in adf kd cells and the level of padf in cofilin kd cells  were measured by western blotting after egf stimulation . densitometry values of pcofilin and padf at  <dig> and 180 s  where compared to the values at 0 sec of the same treatment. after 60 s of egf stimulation, both pcofilin and padf levels increased significantly in control cells, while padf decreased significantly in both control and cofilin kd cells after 180 s of egf stimulation . in addition, the densitometry values from the blots were normalized to gapdh and then expressed relative to pcofilin or padf set at  <dig>  in control cells. we found that pcofilin level did not change significantly in adf kd cells during egf stimulation as compared to pcofilin level in control cells, where as padf levels decreased significantly  by 180 s in cofilin kd cells . the decline in padf in cofilin kd cells is also evident in the blots of figure 1b.

adf and cofilin kd cells exhibit changes in actin cytoskeleton
to determine if adf kd and cofilin kd cells show changes in f-actin organization, mtln <dig> cells were infected for 72 h, fixed and stained with fluorescent-phalloidin. cells were observed and divided into three categories according to the phenotype of their actin cytoskeleton  as described previously  <cit> . both adf kd cells and cofilin kd cells show significant  decrease in normal f-actin . however, adf kd cells contain significantly more f-actin aggregates as compared to the control cells , whereas cofilin kd cells showed a significant increase in prominent f-actin as compared to the control cells  .

adf and cofilin kd cells exhibit reduced ecm-degrading ability
to examine the ability of adf kd or cofilin kd cells to degrade the extracellular matrix , control and silenced cells were cultured on alexa 488- or alexa 594-gelatin attached to a layer of cross-linked gelatin  <cit> . in this assay, proteolysis of the fluorescent-gelatin results in the appearance of dark non-fluorescent areas . both adf kd and cofilin kd cells showed lower ecm degradation activity when compared to control infected cells .

adf or cofilin kd cells were co-infected with adenoviruses containing human adf or cofilin cdnas with conserved mutations that escaped sirna silencing. proteins were expressed as either the mrfp chimera huadf.mrfp  or hucofilin.mrfp , or as untagged versions huadf.redtrack or hucofilin.redtrack. each of these viruses uses the cmv promoter to drive adf/cofilin expression. the degradation area in these co-expressing cells was measured . adf kd cells expressing exogenous adf  or cofilin  had a control-like degradation area . expressing exogenous hucofilin.mrfp in adf kd cells increased the area of degradation when compared to control cells . degradation areas in cofilin kd cells expressing exogenous adf or cofilin were somewhat more variable but were not significantly different from control  .

reduction of cofilin expression enhances cell adhesion to collagen i
since adf kd and cofilin kd cells showed changes in cell morphology and the actin cytoskeleton that suggested changes in cell adhesion, we next investigated the effect of adf and cofilin depletion on mtln <dig> cell adhesion. cells were stained with anti-paxillin antibody and the size and number of focal adhesions were measured per unit area  at the leading edge of similarly shaped cells , an average of  <dig> unit areas at the leading edge of each cell were selected. cofilin silencing but not adf silencing significantly increased the total area occupied by focal adhesions  per 40 μm <dig> area  as compared to control cells  .

next, we infected cofilin kd cells with the different rescue adenoviruses expressing either adf or cofilin and the total area occupied by focal adhesion/40 μm <dig> was measured in these co-expressing cells. cofilin kd cells expressing exogenous cofilin  were not significantly different  in cell adhesion  from control cells , suggesting that the increased focal adhesion area arose from cofilin suppression. adf expression, either as mrfp chimera or untagged, in cofilin kd cells did not restore focal adhesion area to the control level   , demonstrating that adf cannot substitute for cofilin in this process.

in addition, control, adf kd and cofilin kd cells were seeded onto collagen i coated dishes, and adherent cells were quantified after 1 h . we found that the number of adherent cells was greater in cofilin kd cells but not in adf kd cells , compared to control cells  . cofilin kd cells expressing exogenous hucofilin.mrfp or untagged cofilin, but not adf, behaved like control infected cells .

suppression of adf or cofilin expression increases the rate of migration
since adf and cofilin depletion affected actin organization and cell polarization, we next analyzed the effect of knocking down adf or cofilin on the migration of mtln <dig> cells. we measured the number of adf kd and cofilin kd cells migrating across type i collagen-coated filters . knocking down adf or cofilin significantly  enhanced mtln <dig> cell migration by almost 80% compared to control cells . re-expressing exogenous adf but neither tagged nor untagged cofilin in adf kd cells decreased the number of cells migrating across collagen i-coated filters to the control level . in cofilin kd cells, the number of migrating cells was reduced to control levels by expressing exogenous cofilin . however, expressing exogenous untagged adf but not adf.mrfp, in cofilin kd cells also decreased the number of migrating cells , suggesting that either the activity or accessibility of target binding by the chimeric huadf.rfp is less than that of the non-chimera.

the wound healing assay measures cell directed migration as a response to clearing of cells in a monolayer  <cit> . as expected from the results of the migration assay above, the migration rate of adf kd and cofilin kd cells in a wound healing assay increased significantly when compared to the control  . the migration rate of adf kd cells  was reduced to that of control cells  upon expressing either exogenous huadf.rfp  or untagged adf , p >  <dig>  versus control, but not with expression of exogenous tagged or untagged cofilin . for cofilin kd cells, re-expressing cofilin, tagged or untagged, restored the migration rate to that of control cells . in addition, expressing exogenous untagged adf but not adf.mrfp in cofilin kd cells slowed them down  significantly .

the migration rates of control and kd cells were measured by time lapse microscopy from the center position of the cell body  over 30 min using kymography. four different line scans of each cell, each going through the centroid, were selected and a kymograph was created for each region . the kymograph was then analyzed and the centroid position was plotted versus time and a slope was calculated . the migration rate  which equals  was then calculated. again, it was found that silencing either adf or cofilin in mtln <dig> cells significantly enhanced the cell migration rate  as compared to control cells   .

expressing exogenous adf , but not cofilin, in adf kd cells reduced the migration rate to that of control cells   . expressing exogenous non-chimeric hucofilin in cofilin kd cells reduced the migration rate to that of the control cells .

adf kd increases the time and frequency of protrusion and cofilin kd increases the time and persistence of protrusion
the lamellipodial histories  of polar migrating mtln <dig> cells were also analyzed using kymography . polar control cells spent less than half of the 30 min  protruding and spent the rest of the time pausing  or retracting  , and on average the lamellipodium fluctuated between protrusion and retraction  <dig> times per 30 min, while it paused less than two times over the same period . on the other hand, polar adf kd cells protruded  <dig> %, paused  <dig> % and retracted  <dig> % of the 30 min , and on average the lamellipodium fluctuated between protrusion and retraction  <dig> times per 30 min, while it paused once over the same period . polar cofilin kd cells protruded  <dig> %, paused  <dig> % and retracted  <dig> % of the 30 min , and on average the lamellipodium fluctuated between protrusion and retraction  <dig> times per 30 min, while it paused once over the same period . the protrusion of the lamellipodium of cofilin kd cells persisted , significantly longer than in control  and adf kd cells  .

expressing exogenous untagged adf in adf kd cells reduced the percentage of time adf kd cells spend protruding  by increasing the pausing time  . in addition, untagged adf expression in adf kd cells reduced the frequency of protrusion and increased pausing frequency . exogenous untagged cofilin decreased the percentage of time cofilin kd cells spend protruding  and increased the percentage of pausing and retraction time  . in addition, both cofilin.mrfp and untagged cofilin expressed in cofilin kd cells decreased the protrusion persistence and increased the persistence of retraction .

discussion
most studies on mtln <dig> mammary adenocarcinoma cells and many other tumor cell types that have addressed changes in the regulatory proteins that alter actin organization have focused on cofilin- <dig>  <cit> , primarily because it was reported to be the major adf/cofilin protein expressed in mtln <dig> cells  <cit> . however, this determination used antibodies that had a much greater affinity toward cofilin than toward adf. using chick adf as an antigen, we developed an antibody that has a strong affinity toward the epitope around amino acids 50– <dig> in chick adf, which is conserved in both mammalian adf and cofilin, and thus serves as a pan adf/cofilin antibody in mammals  <cit> . using this antibody we discovered that mtln <dig> cells express nearly identical amounts of each isoform . thus, these cells provided the ideal model system in which to determine if adf and cofilin have fully redundant or overlapping roles in polarization and polarized migration.

in addition, since cofilin but not adf is essential for normal cell behavior and its global inhibition would be detrimental to non-tumor tissue  <cit> , demonstrating that adf activity plays a different role in metastasis from cofilin might open up new avenues for therapeutic targeting. thus, the aim of this study was to examine the requirements for adf and cofilin individually for each step during polarization and migration of mtln <dig> cells.

mtln <dig> cells are large and flat making them suitable for quantitative imaging at the cellular and sub-cellular level. in addition, individual adf or cofilin silencing did not significantly alter the expression of the other , eliminating the need to study this compensatory mechanism which occurs in some cell types  <cit> . however, cofilin silencing did lead to increased amounts of the active  form of adf , suggesting some compensation in this direction but the opposite  did not occur. the reason for this compensatory change in only one direction is likely due to the maintenance of greater f-actin pools in cofilin kd cells versus the actin aggregates that accumulate in adf kd cells . a major phosphatase involved in activating both adf and cofilin is slingshot-1 l  which requires f-actin binding for its activity  <cit> .

dense aggregates of actin that stain with phalloidin have been observed in cultured cells in which both adf and cofilin have been silenced  <cit> . actin aggregate formation is blocked by the myosin ii inhibitor blebbistatin  <cit> , suggesting that the ability of adf to compete with myosin ii for f-actin binding leads to more aggregates in adf kd than in cofilin kd cells as observed here . previous studies showed that cofilin kd caused a significant actin reorganization represented by increased stress fibers compared to control mtln <dig> cells  <cit> . in addition, sirna suppression of cofilin in nih3t <dig> and mouse neuroblastoma cells led to accumulation of f-actin and increase in the thickness of stress fibers  <cit> . equally interesting are results from studies that expressed the kinase domain of limk  <cit> , which showed enhanced actin aggregates. in this latter study adf activity would be affected equally to cofilin. although adf is a more efficient monomer sequestering protein than cofilin  <cit> , its major mechanism in blocking aggregate formation is probably through its competition with myosin ii in the actomyosin contraction leading to aggregates. these differences between the two proteins activities led to different effects on actin cytoskeleton organization.

focal adhesions are sites of large macromolecular assemblies containing integrins with linkages to cytoplasmic actin bundles  <cit> , and collagen in the extracellular matrix  <cit> . we observed a significant increase in collagen i-mediated cell adhesion of cofilin kd cells and not adf kd cells . these findings imply that adf and cofilin are not redundant in the mtln <dig> cell attachment process. the enlarged focal adhesions certainly contribute to the accumulation of stress fibers in cofilin kd cells, producing a tension force by their contraction  <cit> . such a force is needed for the forward movement of the cell body  <cit>  but release from these adhesions is also needed for efficient movement.

previous studies showed that limk knockdown suppressed fibronectin-mediated rat ascites hepatoma cell attachment and focal adhesion formation  <cit> . furthermore, formation of focal adhesions in hela cells was substantially enhanced in cells transfected with a vector expressing the cofilin kinase tesk <dig> but was reduced in cells expressing a kinase inactive tesk <dig> which suppressed cofilin phosphorylation, as well as formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions in cells plated on fibronectin  <cit> . in addition, depletion of the actin-binding protein coronin 2a in mtln <dig> cells led to a decreased rate of focal adhesion disassembly, which was mediated through increased phosphorylated cofilin; expression of an active mutant of cofilin  restored focal adhesion turnover to that of control cells  <cit> . in our work, the area occupied by focal adhesion in cofilin kd cells was restored to that of control cells when human cofilin but not adf was re-expressed . taken together, these findings demonstrate that cofilin has a more prominent role than adf in regulating cell adhesion, and thus in releasing tail focal adhesions necessary for the crescent cell morphology .

since adf and cofilin are responsible for actin dynamics, and they are well-known regulators that trigger and maintain cell polarization  <cit> , the significant decrease observed in the percentage of egf-induced polarized cells in the adf kd and cofilin kd cells compared to controls  was expected. overexpression in endogenously polarized chick embryo heart fibroblasts of a constitutively active mutant of limk or a pseudophosphorylated mutant of xenopus adf/cofilin in which ser  <dig> has been replaced by glu  caused the cells to lose their polarized phenotype and extend multiple lamellipodia  <cit> . tail retraction of migrating polarized cells has been shown to require adf/cofilin activity  <cit> . in adf kd cells, the crescent shape is the dominant shape after egf stimulation whereas tail persistence  is more prevalent in cofilin kd cells  suggesting that cofilin is more responsible for tail retraction., these differences might arise because cofilin has a greater ability than adf to reduce focal adhesion size  and/or because adf has a somewhat greater ability to compete with myosin ii for actin binding  <cit> ; myosin ii-mediated contractility also plays a role in tail retraction  <cit> .

our migration rate results are in agreement with those of others  <cit> , who found that cofilin knockdown resulted in higher cell migration velocities and increased directionality. cofilin kd mtln <dig> cells followed a more linear path compared to the random walking path of control mtln <dig> cells  <cit> . the higher migration rate observed in kd cells is consistent with our findings of lamellipodia history; adf kd causes the cells to spend more time protruding and their protrusion is more frequent  compared to control cells . in addition, cofilin kd cells spend more time protruding because their protrusion is more persistent  compared to control cells , probably due to enhanced adhesion of the protrusion.

since adf but not cofilin can serve as a major monomer sequestering protein  <cit> , the effect of adf kd on lamellipodia protrusion could be due to a greater alteration of the actin monomer pool than that obtained with cofilin sirna treatment  <cit> . adf depletion causes a decrease in g-actin. the availability and localization of g-actin monomer near the leading edge is essential for cell polarization and thus directional cell migration  <cit> . in addition, the spatiotemporal localization of g-actin regulates actin dynamics required for lamellipodia protrusion, and decreased g-/f-actin ratio at the leading edge has been found to be associated with pausing and retraction of protrusions  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have demonstrated that although both adf and cofilin are redundant for many cell behaviors, there are subtle differences in how these proteins affect cell adhesion and migration that are likely to be important in understanding the migration of different metastatic tumor cells. it should be pointed out that our analysis has been restricted to migration on a two dimensional substrate. cells traversing through a  <dig> dimensional network in which adhesions are not formed in a distinct plane may show additional differences in behavior depending on their relative amounts and activities of adf and cofilin  <cit> .
