BACKGROUND
neuroblastoma , the most common cancer at infancy  <cit>  accounts for about one tenth of pediatric cancer deaths . despite significant advances in understanding the biology of nb and, improved clinical outcomes in the last decade  <cit> , the outcomes for high-risk groups still soar. to that note, cure after relapse of high-risk disease with remarkable heterogeneity, resistance and, poor hematological reserve is extremely rare. almost half of patients with high-risk nb will relapse with hematogenous metastasis  <cit>  despite intensive multimodal therapy . compared with those with low/intermediate-risk disease , the five-year overall survival  of patients with high-risk disease is low . the rate of long-term survival is even more dismal ten years after diagnosis, with only 2 % os for patients with stage  <dig> disease  <cit> . cancer cells should successfully complete multiple sequential steps, including spreading from the tumor of origin, intravasation, extravasation and colonization, before they will grow and proliferate at a secondary site and form a new tumor  <cit> . the capability of cancer cells to metastasize depends on genetic and epigenetic events that are acquired during tumor progression  <cit> . despite great advancements in our knowledge of metastasis biology, the molecular mechanisms are still incompletely understood. remarkably, the regulatory role for mirnas in metastasis has been established . thus, these mirnas have been identified as metastamirs  <cit> , as they have both pro- and anti-metastatic effects. accordingly, we used a unique, mycn non-amplified mouse model of human high-risk aggressive metastatic neuroblastoma coupled with whole genome mirna approach to investigate the functional reorganization of metastamirs in nb progression.

genomic amplification of mycn plays a dominant role in determining the biologic behavior of neuroblastoma and is strongly associated with advanced stage of the disease, rapid tumor progression, therapy resistance and overall poor prognosis . however, the realm of mycn amplification is restricted to about 20 % of all cases of neuroblastoma  <cit> , ~30-40 % of stage  <dig> and stage  <dig> and only ~10 % of stage 4 s patients  <cit> . critically, the lack of mycn amplification without either 1p loss or 17q gain further limits the role of mycn in distinguishing those patients who are likely to survive from those that are destined to fail treatment  <cit> . moreover, long-term survival of advanced neuroblastoma patients with mycn amplification has also been reported  <cit> . conversely, prognostic insights and molecular drivers of the mycn non-amplified high-risk neuroblastoma, that comprises about 60-70 % of stage  <dig> and stage  <dig> disease remains unexplored. more importantly, mycn expression does not correlate with the prognosis of adverse outcome in advanced-stage neuroblastoma with non-amplified mycn  <cit> . in this regard, we utilized, mycn non-amplified cell-line  derived mouse model of human high-risk aggressive metastatic neuroblastoma to define the functional reorganization of metastamirs in neuroblastoma progression.

mirnas are endogenous, hairpin-shaped, small non-coding single-stranded rnas of ∼ <dig> nucleotides in length; they serve as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression  <cit> . although mirnas were initially considered non-functional, recent studies documented the potential of mirnas to control cell fate , as well as their conservation across species  <cit> , expression in different tissues and cell types, and their involvement in every biological process. mirnas function as guide molecules by base pairing with the target mrna, inducing translation repression or transcripts cleavage  <cit> . consequently, mirna deregulation is a hallmark of several pathological conditions, including cancer.

metastamirs are regulatory mirnas which promote or suppress various steps in the migration and metastasis of cancer cells  <cit> . it seems that these metastasis-associated mirnas do not influence primary tumors in either the development or initiation steps of tumorigenesis, but they regulate key steps in the metastatic program and processes, such as emt, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. emerging evidence continually recognizes tumor-specific metastamirs in many tumor models, including breast, lung, prostate, colorectal, gastric, and head and neck cancer. however, in the context of neuroblastoma, no metastamirs have been grouped or identified. altered expression of select mirnas  has been shown to exert a causal role in metastasis . it is noteworthy that these studies focus on a single mirna manipulation approach, underscoring the metastatic response through a single gene target. considering the complexity of sequential steps involved in metastasis, it is necessary to ascertain all causal metastamirs that play crucial roles in nb metastasis. to our knowledge, this is the first of such an endeavor in the neuroblastoma setting. the results of this study comprehensively identified  <dig> metastamirs from whole genome mirna profiles of a manifold of metastatic tumors from a unique clinically translatable mouse model of aggressive high-risk nb. further, this study determined the translation of these metastamir reorganizations into the functional downstream response, that is, target proteins translation that defines metastasis, and the influential role of metastimirs in clinical outcomes.

RESULTS
spontaneous and reproducible high-risk metastatic disease in vivo
human neuroblastoma cell-line, sh-sy5y is the third sub-line of sk-n-sh  that contains both neuroblast-like  floating and substrate-adherent  epithelial-like cells  <cit> . more importantly, sh-sy5y cells are unique mycn non-amplified cells. xenotransplantation of sh-sy5y cells resulted in the development of ~200 mm <dig> xenografts in ~70 % of the animals within 30 days   <cit> . about 30 % of the mice that received identical clones initially  showed xenograft development, then subsided to a residual tumor . however, over an extended 50– <dig> day period, these mice suddenly gained weight and presented with multiple clinically-mimicking metastatic tumors in the mediastinum and retroperitoneal, pelvic, abdominal, and chest cavities . these mice generally produced 5– <dig> large, viable, often multi-lobular tumors in multiple sites with well-organized blood supplies . this aggressive disease with metastatic dissemination developed over a short period  and vigorously, as evidenced by time-lapse non-invasive fluorescence imaging. parallel xenotransplanted animals with no tumor dissemination to distant sites over the extended period served as the non-metastatic controls.fig.  <dig> comparative mirna profiling in non-metastatic primary xenografts and the manifold of metastatic tumors from animals bearing aggressive neuroblastoma. a representative mice showing non-metastatic xenograft and high-risk aggressive metastatic disease. plate showing tumors harvested from multiple metastatic sites. b schematic representation showing relative tumorigenic capacity and aggressive disease formation of parental sh-sy5y and metastatic site derived aggressive cells . subcutaneously injecting msdacs produced large xenograft with multiple metastatic tumors in retroperitoneal, pelvic, abdominal, and chest cavities. c traverse analysis of whole genome mirna expression between non-metastatic  and aggressive disease  animals. total of  <dig> mirnas were compared between groups and their alterations are color coded . total number of altered molecules under each comparison is provided in the corresponding box. numbers in the parenthesis are the molecules that are significantly  modulated



metastatic site derived aggressive cell  clones derived from the manifold of metastatic tumors were discretely characterized by karyotyping, whole genome array cgh analysis, and tumorosphere-forming capacity . msdacs are relatively small and spherical with thin neurites. administration of msdacs produced >500 mm <dig> tumors , compared with the <150 mm <dig> xenografts  resulting from parental cells within 30 days . the mice that received msdacs presented with multiple metastatic tumors in the retroperitoneal, pelvic, abdominal, and chest cavities, demonstrating the reproducibility of the aggressive disease. conversely, the mice that received parental cells did not exhibit any distant metastasis.

reorganization of metastamirs in high-risk metastatic disease
to define the mirnas’ modulations in the evolution of high-risk neuroblastoma and to identify crucial players  that orchestrate metastasis, we adopted a whole genome mirna profiling approach. a total of  <dig> functional transcripts were assayed in triplicate for each condition. traverse analysis between the non-metastatic controls to the manifold of metastatic tumors not only recognized unique animal/tumor-specific expression signatures, but also identified clusters of mirnas that were commonly up-or downregulated . overall, of the  <dig> transcripts analyzed, we observed an upregulation of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  mirnas in metastatic tumors. applying stringent criteria , a total of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  mirnas were significantly upregulated in the metastatic tumors. evidently,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mirnas were upregulated across all the metastatic tumors investigated. upregulation of  <dig> mirnas remained consistent across the metastatic tumors, irrespective of the comparisons to the non-metastatic controls . conversely, a total of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  mirnas were downregulated in metastatic tumors. significantly ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  mirnas were completely suppressed in the metastatic tumors. more importantly,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mirnas were downregulated across all metastatic tumors. remarkably, downregulation of  <dig> mirnas persisted across the metastatic tumors, irrespective of the traverse comparisons to the controls .fig.  <dig> activated mirnas in high-risk metastatic neuroblastoma. histograms showing the expression profile of  <dig> mirnas that were significantly  up regulated across the metastatic tumors of the animals with aggressive disease. data mining was performed using traverse analysis comparing each non-metastatic control to that of the aggressive disease profiles

to validate the altered expression levels observed with whole genome mirna array, we examined the expression levels of select mirnas including hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-1224-3p , hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-20a, hsa-mir-125b, hsa-mir-27b , using individual mirna qpcr analysis. compared to the non-metastatic xenograft, we observed a complete  decrease in the expression of hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-20a, hsa-mir-125b, and hsa-mir-27b . conversely, we observed a significant  upregulation of hsa-mir- <dig> and hsa-mir-1224-3p in metastatic tumor compared with the non-metastatic control . these data are consistent with the observed expression levels of these mirnas using the whole genome approach.

altered expression of the target  proteins validates the translation of the functional response of the neuroblastoma metastamirs
to further substantiate our findings, we investigated the expression levels of target proteins of the identified metastamirs. since metastasis is a complex processes, and as we identified a total of  <dig> metastamirs in this setting, we examined a total of  <dig> targets that are involved in tumor progression, i.e., metastasis, in msdacs and a manifold of metastatic tumors. metastamirs regulating these targets and their expression status in our study are presented in table  <dig> . in msdacs grown ex vivo, we observed an induced expression of adamts- <dig>  casp <dig>  cdk <dig>  ctgf, cyclin-d <dig>  elk <dig>  esr <dig>  cfos, fra, il-1α, jund, kras, mcp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  cmyc, sele, tnfα, and vegf, and phosphorylation of akt1/2/ <dig>  nos <dig>  p <dig>  and egfr compared with the parental sh-sy5y cells . compared with the non-metastatic xenograft controls, we observed a robust increase in adamts- <dig>  ask <dig>  aurkβ, birc <dig>  birc <dig>  birc <dig>  cd <dig>  cdk <dig>  ctgf, cxcr <dig>  cyclin-d <dig>  egfr, elk <dig>  esr <dig>  cfos, fra, grb <dig>  pgsk3β, il1α, jund, krtap1- <dig>  megf <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  mta <dig>  myb, cmyc, nf <dig>  p <dig>  ptpn <dig>  cleaved parp, pkc, sdf-1β, sema3d, sele, stat <dig>  tnfα, tnfr <dig>  and vegf expression, as well as akt1/2/ <dig> and nos <dig> phosphorylation in the manifold of metastatic tumors .table  <dig> targets analyzed by the western-blot and the expression status  of the corresponding metastamirs in high-risk metastatic neuroblastoma

we then sought to define and typify the target alterations in aggressive neuroblastoma. we used a custom-made tma constructed with a manifold of tumors from the metastatic sites of several animals coupled with non-metastatic xenograft controls. these were subjected to automated ihc and image analysis for select targets, including megf <dig>  krtap1- <dig>  sema3d, myc, and grb <dig>  consistent with our immunoblotting observations under ex vivo and in vivo conditions, megf <dig>  krtap1- <dig>  sema3d, myc, and grb <dig> ihc staining revealed relatively strong positivity in metastatic tumors . multiple egf-like-domains- <dig>  positive staining appeared in brown, and was predominantly localized in plasma membranes in a punctuated pattern . megf <dig> immunoreactivity was barely detectable in non-metastatic nb xenografts. however, the manifold of metastatic tumors exhibited significantly high immunoreactivity for megf <dig> localization . keratin-associated protein family 1– <dig>  positivity appeared in brown, and was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm . consistent with our immunoblotting data, we observed a profound and significant  increase in the expression of krtap1- <dig> in the metastatic tumors as opposed to the non-metastatic controls . likewise, semaphorin-3d  ihc exhibited moderate cytoplasmic positivity with a dark brown color . compared with the non-metastatic controls, increased expression of sema-3d was evident in almost all metastatic tumors analyzed. myc-ihc revealed strong nuclear positivity in all tumors analyzed. we observed a marginal increase in myc expression in the metastatic tumors when compared with non-metastatic controls . growth factor receptor-bound protein  <dig>  ihc revealed high levels of localization in non-metastatic neuroblastoma tissues. notably, immunoreactivity was highly intense and significant  in metastatic tumors . the positive staining of grb <dig> appeared in dark brown, and was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm.fig.  <dig> localization and expressional modulation of metastamirs target proteins in metastatic neuroblastoma. representative image of the tissue micro array constructed with the replicates of non-metastatic xenografts controls and the manifold of metastatic tumors from spontaneous aggressive disease as well as the reproduced aggressive disease animals. automated ihc stained panels showing the staining pattern and cellular localization of the metastamirs’ protein targets  in tumor samples. histograms of aperio-spectrum image analysis and quantification of positivity for each target protein analyzed across the metastatic tumors of various animals presented with aggressive disease. the positivity values are compared to the non-metastatic xenograft controls using anova with tukey’s post-hoc correction using graphpad prism



these observations were consistent across tumors from the same animal as well as tumors from different animals. we observed similar alterations in the expression of megf <dig>  krtap1- <dig>  sema3d, myc, and grb <dig> in the manifold of distant tumors reproduced from aggressive disease-bearing animals. aperio image analysis coupled with prism stats were used to demonstrate the increased expression of these target proteins in the tumors of animals with aggressive disease, but not in the non-metastatic xenografts . ex vivo and in vivo upregulation of these targets, which are well—documented candidates for metastasis and tumor progression of the metastamirs that were identified in this study, underscores the translation of the functional response  of metastamirs in this setting.

altered mirnas dependent regulation of functional targets
further to define the direct role of the deregulated mirnas of high-risk aggressive disease in the regulation of the target proteins that demonstrated profound alterations both in the metastatic tumors in vivo and in msdacs ex vivo we examined the corresponding alterations of the target proteins after functionally mimicking or inhibiting mirnas. first, msdacs transiently transfected with mimics for hsa-mir-125b, hsa-mir-27b, hsa-mir- <dig> or hsa-mir-20a  and examined for the regulation of their corresponding target proteins . high-throughput quantitative confocal immunofluorescence demonstrated a significant  inhibition of mmp <dig>  p <dig>  tnfα and vegf in msdacs in the presence of hsa-mir-125b mimic . in addition, we observed a marginal decrease in grb <dig> and stat <dig> expression with hsa-mir-125b mimic. similarly, functionally mimicking hsa-mir-27b resulted in the profound  inhibition of fosb, kras, p <dig> and ptpn <dig> . interestingly, mimicking hsa-mir-27b did not inhibit the expression of egfr and vegf in msdacs. on the other hand, msdacs transfected with hsa-mir-20a exhibited significant  inhibition of ask <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp3/ <dig>  ptpn <dig> and vegf . we did not see any consistent inhibition of creb and stat <dig> at least with the mimic for hsa-mir-20a. moreover, hsa-mir- <dig> mimic exhibited statistically significant inhibition of mmp <dig>  mmp3/ <dig>  ptpn <dig> and stat <dig> in this setting . next, msdacs transiently transfected with inhibitors for hsa-mir-1224-3p or hsa-mir- <dig>  and examined for the alterations in protein targets. inhibiting hsa-mir-1224-3p resulted in the significant  induction of adamts- <dig> and creb . like-wise, inhibiting hsa-mir- <dig> markedly  induced adamts- <dig> and ask <dig> . however, inhibiting hsa-mir- <dig> did not result in the induction of fosb and akt- <dig> in this setting. together, these results clearly demonstrate the direct role of altered mirnas observed in high-risk aggressive disease in the regulation of the protein targets identified in this setting and, thereby validates the translation of functional response of the neuroblastoma metastamirs.fig.  <dig> metastamirs dependent regulation of functional protein targets. a operetta high-content confocal imaging showing immunofluorescence of adamts- <dig>  ask- <dig>  creb, fosb, grb <dig>  kras, mmp <dig>  mmp3/ <dig>  p <dig>  akt, ptpn <dig>  stat <dig>  tnfα and vegfa in msdacs. b histograms of mean cell–alexa fluor intensity obtained from columbus automated batch analysis showing alterations in the expression  grb <dig>  mmp <dig>  p <dig>  stat <dig>  tnfα and vegf in cells with hsa-mir-125b mimic,  egfr fosb, kras, p <dig>  ptpn <dig> and vegf in hsa-mir-27b mimic transfected cells,  ask <dig>  creb, mmp <dig>  mmp3/ <dig>  ptpn <dig>  stat3and vegf in msdacs with hsa-mir-20a mimic and,  mmp <dig>  mmp3/ <dig>  ptpn <dig> and stat <dig> with hsa-mir- <dig> mimic in msdacs. c histograms of mean cell–alexa fluor intensity showing alterations in the expression of  adamts- <dig> and creb with hsa-mir-1224-3p inhibition and,  adamts- <dig>  ask <dig>  fosb and akt- <dig> with hsa-mir- <dig> inhibition. group-wise comparisons were performed with anova with tukey’s post-hoc correction



altered mirnas serve as metastamirs
to determine the relevance of metastamirs in aggressive disease, we first clarified their role in cancer biological functions, network and communal molecular orchestrations, and tumor progression. for the mirnas that were reorganized in high-risk nb, ipa “core-analysis” identified multiple networks classifying their roles in diseases including cancer and their specific functions . functionally, these mirnas were shown to be intrinsically involved in cell death and cell survival, inflammation, the cell cycle, cellular movement, dna replication, recombination and repair, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, and cellular growth and proliferation. these processes play defined roles in metastasis . convergence of all of the mirna networks at the processes that endorse metastasis identify the altered mirnas as metastamirs. to further validate whether these mirnas are recognized as metastamirs in other tumor systems, we used the cancer mirna profile database from mircancer.ecu.edu , ingenuity pathway analysis of diseases and biological functions, and a manual literature survey.

of the  <dig> metastamirs, data mining in mircancer identified at least  <dig> that were altered: hsa-let-7a, hsa-let-7b, hsa-let-7c, hsa-let-7e, hsa-let-7f, hsa-let-7 g, hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-125b, hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-148b, hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-190b, hsa-mir-200b, hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-20a, hsa-mir-220a, hsa-mir-23a, hsa-mir-27b, hsa-mir-29b- <dig>  hsa-mir-30b, hsa-mir-30c- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-886-3p, hsa-mir-92a, and hsa-mir- <dig>  alterations in these metastamirs were found in one or more of the following tumor systems: acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, acute promyelocytic leukemia, b-cell lymphoma, bladder cancer, breast cancer, bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, cervical cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, colon cancer, endometrial cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, follicular cancer, gastric cancer, glioblastoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, liver cancer, lung cancer, malignant melanoma, mantle cell lymphoma, medulloblastoma, mesenchymal cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, neuroblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, ovarian carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, papillary thyroid carcinoma, pituitary carcinoma, prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, thyroid cancer, and tongue cancer .

ingenuity pathway analysis, however, identified the expressional association of these metastamirs in at least eighty different tumor systems . armed with the above information, we further explored the crucial role of metastamirs in tumor cell metastasis. additional file 5: table s <dig> shows the list of identified mirnas, their functions in the context of metastasis and tumor progression as per the published evidence, total number of their gene targets, and the references from which we obtained this information. interestingly, almost all of the mirnas identified in our high-risk metastatic neuroblastoma have been well characterized in terms of metastasis regulation , which could identify them as metastamirs.

alterations in the targets of the identified metastamirs are associated with poor clinical outcomes
to demonstrate the functional relevance of these metastamirs to high-risk metastatic neuroblastoma and poor clinical outcomes, we examined the correlation of individual expression of their gene targets with overall survival  in patients with neuroblastoma. utilizing the gene expression data for a cohort of  <dig> human neuroblastoma patients, we examined the prognostic values for a total of  <dig> gene targets that had validated expression levels in our model. kaplan-meier plots showed a significant association between increased expression of elk <dig>  cdk <dig>  mmp <dig>  aurkβ, fra, myb, jund, birc <dig>  akt <dig>  sele, tnfα , nos <dig>  esr <dig>  krtap1- <dig>  mmp <dig>  mmp <dig>  nf <dig>  cxcr <dig>  adamts <dig>  vegf, cd <dig>  egfr, and akt <dig>  and poor os in patients with neuroblastoma. this inverse association also reflects poor relapse-free survival in these patients . interestingly, there was a definite association between creb <dig> loss and poor os . this creb <dig> loss also resulted in poor relapse-free survival in children with neuroblastoma. clinical outcome association analysis revealed a strong correlation between the increased expression of the genes listed above and stage progression, favorable → unfavorable disease and alive → died-of-disease . together, these data demonstrate the alterations of gene targets by the reorganization of metastamirs in high-risk metastatic disease that drives poor clinical outcomes in children with neuroblastoma.

discussion
about 60 % of neuroblastoma patients with high-risk disease will relapse with hematogenous metastasis  <cit> , despite intensive multimodal therapy . neuroblastoma is derived from embryonic neural crest cells that have a high potential to migrate. since metastatic nb has a high mortality rate, understanding the molecular mechanism flow-through that is involved in neuroblastoma cell invasion and metastasis will help us to design more effective therapies against metastatic nb, particularly when we use appropriate clinically translatable animal models. in vitro and in vivo approaches have identified numerous molecular markers that play crucial roles in the functional orchestration of neuroblastoma metastasis . after ma and colleagues  <cit>  demonstrated that mirnas were the upstream regulators of the complex invasion-metastasis network in breast cancer, researchers began to uncover the roles of mirna in highly metastatic neuroblastoma  <cit> . transcriptome regulation occurs via mirnas through multiple processes, including translational inhibition, destabilization, or rna decay  <cit> , all of which are considered important modulators of signal transduction pathways in metastatic progression.

studies delineating the regulatory role of the mirna in neuroblastoma metastasis have thus far been limited to the understanding of a single mirna-associated target molecule’s dependent functions along the axis of metastasis  <cit> . considering the complexity of the sequential steps involved in neuroblastoma metastasis, it is crucial to define the functional role of every mirna  that plays a vital role in each step of metastasis. for the first time, utilizing a clinically translatable animal model of high-risk metastatic neuroblastoma, we have identified the cluster of metastamirs, their functional translation in terms of target protein expression, and the association of such alterations with clinical outcomes.

in the current study, we used multiple complementary methodologies to identify neuroblastoma metastamirs. first, this study employed a unique clinically translatable, reproducible mouse model of human high-risk metastatic neuroblastoma coupled with whole genome mirna array technology. we screened differentially expressed mirnas in metastatic tumors as opposed to non-metastatic tumors. we observed significant inter-animal variations in up-and downregulated mirnas and under less stringent and more stringent conditions . examining this topic further, we validated the most distinctly deregulated over- and under—expressed mirnas by rt-qpcr, utilized traverse analysis of altered mirnas between the sample groups, characterized the reorganized mirnas by compiling their interactions in ingenuity pathway analysis, expression in multiple tumor systems, and their functional role in metastasis and tumor progression. further, we performed mirna-target analysis, comprehensively identified the alterations in the expression and cellular localization of the target proteins in ex vivo and in vivo metastatic cells, recognized the direct influence of the altered mirnas on the regulation of target proteins with mimic/inhibitor approach, and compiled the target proteins’ association with neuroblastoma patient outcomes.

since the main objective was to identify the defined metastamirs of neuroblastoma, we compared the traverse examination of four aggressive disease expression profiles to that of non-metastatic profiles to derive clear evidence of differential expression without equivocal outcomes. interestingly, the outcome of the present work confirmed some findings from other neuroblastoma mirna studies   <cit> , but also essentially identified many new metastamirs in this setting. of the  <dig> metastamirs identified in this study, we found an overlap of  <dig> metastamirs, including hsa-mir-148b, hsa-mir-23a, hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-125b, hsa-mir- <dig>  hsa-mir-92a, hsa-mir-29b, hsa-mir-30c, hsa-let-7a, hsa-let-7b, hsa-let-7c, hsa-let-7e, hsa-let-7f, and hsa-let-7g, with the findings of other researchers. to our knowledge, this is the first such attempt to identify all-inclusive mirnas that could play defined roles in metastasis, their functional translation, and their association with clinical outcomes, at least in the neuroblastoma setting. almost all studies that investigated mirna roles in neuroblastoma metastasis focused on understanding a single molecule. as discussed above, our approach to identify new metastamirs in the neuroblastoma setting is directly related to the lack of any comprehensive approach studies for neuroblastoma or other tumor types. limited overlap with similar studies in other cancers  <cit>  may reflect the use of different detection platforms, mirbase releases, or tumor models or origins. in addition, results that are based solely on microarray data have a relatively high false-positive rate. thus, we validated our microarray results with rt-qpcr for upregulation  and downregulation  profiles .

since it is important to characterize each of the reorganized mirnas in neuroblastoma metastasis, and this activity was within the scope of this study, we extensively investigated the role of each mirna in tumor progression and metastasis in multiple tumor systems, including neuroblastoma. regulation of these mirnas has been documented in many tumor systems and biological functions, including metastasis . though it is not practical to discuss each mirna, we compiled their biological functions in the light of the published evidence that identifies them as metastamirs . however, to understand their precise function in neuroblastoma metastasis and since expression profiles do not give us information about their biological functions, we measured the expressional alterations of key targets that were shown to play crucial roles in metastasis. for the first time, we quantified the expression and phosphorylation of  <dig> target proteins. further, to capture the metastamirs associated with translational alterations of the targets, we characterized their expression in metastatic cells ex vivo and in the manifold of aggressive metastatic tumors. the targets examined in the study are regulated by more than one metastamir identified in this setting . thus, to the best of our knowledge, the presented list of  <dig> deregulated metastasis-related protein targets of metastamirs provides the most extensive list of neuroblastoma metastamirs’ associated response. in this respect, the global approach in our study to assess the expression data in the manifold of metastatic tumors, all in the screening phase by microarrays, in the validation phase by rt-qpcr and response validation by target protein expressions and their mirna dependent regulation, as mentioned above, proved to be advantageous. we also applied clinical outcome association analysis with the validated protein targets of the identified metastamirs in the neuroblastoma setting. induced expression  and suppression  of metastamirs’ target proteins corresponded strongly with poor patient outcomes .

CONCLUSIONS
for the first time, this study of mirnas profiles in non-metastatic and metastatic neuroblastoma identified a comprehensive list of  <dig> deregulated metastasis-associated mirnas, termed metastamirs. we primarily recognized new mirnas associated with neuroblastoma metastasis, and also confirmed the results of other studies, as only a few mirnas have been described as neuroblastoma metastamirs. further, our results demonstrated a significant modulation in the expression of  <dig> key metastasis-regulating protein targets of these metastamirs in aggressive cells ex vivo and in the manifold of metastatic tumors in vivo. more importantly, the clinical outcome association analysis corresponded with poor overall and relapse-free survival. in conclusion, the current study identified a distinctive set of neuroblastoma metastamirs that could serve as potential candidates for diagnostic markers for the switch from favorable to high-risk metastatic disease.
