BACKGROUND
cassava  is the basic source for dietary energy of  <dig> million people in tropical and subtropical areas of africa, asia, and latin america  <cit> . in brazil, the hornworm erinnyis ello ello  is one of the most important pests  <cit>  occurring throughout the year and greatly impacting cassava production  <cit> . this pest has been observed in  <dig> plant species, especially in the euphorbiaceae family  <cit> . in large infestations, the cassava pest may reduce by 50% the roots yield. in the 1980s, a naturally occurring baculovirus was isolated from this pest and applied as a bio-pesticide in brazil  <cit> . the biological control program has proven to be safe and economical  <cit> . however, genomic and structural information about this virus is lacking.

the baculoviridae is a family of insect viruses with circular double-stranded genomic dna  that have been successfully applied for the control of agricultural and forest pests  <cit> . so far, alpha and betabaculovirus are the most studied baculovirus genera; both infect lepidoptera  <cit> . the infection is initiated when larvae feed on foliage contaminated with orally infectious occlusion bodies   <cit>  that release occlusion derived-virions  in the midgut  <cit> . early after primary midgut epithelial cell infection, budded virions  are produced and cause systemic infection. infection symptoms include cuticle discoloration, movement loss, and incapability for feeding  <cit> .

few full-length betabaculovius genome sequences are available compared to those from alphabaculovirus and none of them was isolated from sphingid host. in this context, identification and sequencing of virus species from different lepidopteran families will provide a wider empirical database to help understand baculovirus evolution  <cit> . here, we presented the morphological characterization, the complete genome sequence, and the phylogenetic analyses of the natural cassava hornworm pesticide, the first completely sequenced betabaculovirus isolated from a sphingid host.

RESULTS
virus characterization and genome features
a naturally occurring baculovirus was isolated from dead cassava hornworm  caterpillars in crops from the south of brazil in  <dig>  as shown in figure 1a, the larvae is usually found hanged in cassava apical leaves, which is a characteristic symptom of the baculovirus infections  <cit> . neither cuticle melanization nor post-mortem melting phenotypes were observed among the caterpillar cadavers, an attribute which probably facilitated virus collection and use for pesticide production as previously observed in another baculovirus   <cit> . ultrastructural analyses revealed a granular ob with irregular form and size  containing single rod-shaped nucleocapsid . both of these structural features, i.e. granular form and nucleocapsid shape, are typical of viruses from the genus betabaculovirus  <cit>  and thus, we named it erinnyis ello granulovirus  isolate br-s <dig> . two other cassava hornworm-isolated granuloviruses were previously reported, one isolated in colombia  <cit>  and another from an undisclosed geographical source  <cit> . restriction endonuclease profile analyses  suggest that the brazilian and the colombian viruses  are either variants of the same species or are distinct species infecting the same host. however, the absence of sequence data from the latter prevents establishment of any phylogenetic relationship.figure  <dig>

we sequenced the genome of erelgv, the first completely sequenced sphingid host-isolated betabaculovirus . the genome is  <dig>  bp long with a g + c content of  <dig> % . we found  <dig> putative genes coding for polypeptides of at least  <dig> amino acid residues. additional file 1: table s <dig> summarizes the erelgv genes and compares each predicted protein sequence with its orthologs in other baculoviruses. eight of these were shown to be unique , and all of them are peptides with no significant similarity to any other sequence in genbank. all  <dig> baculoviridae core genes were found and no typical homologous regions  were detected. however, we identified five putative homologous regions /repeat regions lacking typical alphabaculovirus hr palindromes. this feature is also found in both choristoneura occidentalis granulovirus  and pieris rapae granulovirus  genomes. as observed in chocgv  <cit> , erelgv lacks both gp <dig> and exon <dig>  which was previously predicted for being shared among all alpha and betabaculovirus  <cit> .table  <dig>

phylogenetic analysis
in order to better understand the evolutionary history of erelgv and the genus betabaculovirus, we carried out a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis using the  <dig> baculovirus core gene alignment from all baculovirus genome available. erelgv clustered with chocgv and both viruses share the same ancestor with piragv isolates . since the chinese and korean piragv isolates are very similar to each other , we have included only the chinese isolate in our analyses. using mauve alignment  <cit> , we found that chocgv and piragv genomes have respectively  <dig> % and  <dig> % of global pairwise identity when compared to erelgv genome. additionally, our phylogenetic analyses did not find support for betabaculovirus division in two clades , as described previously using neighbor joining clustering method  <cit> . phylogenetic relationships in baculoviridae, in particular in the genus betabaculovirus, are difficult to discern due to the limited number of sequenced genomes available . therefore, we further evaluated erelgv phylogenetic relationships using granulin, lef- <dig>  and lef- <dig> partial gene dataset as previously carried out  <cit>  , but including new sequences publicly available  totalizing  <dig> granulovirus sequences. this analysis revealed that erelgv isolate br-s <dig> is closely related to another erelgv  from the steinhaus collection  <cit>  and that both are closer to andraca bipunctata granulovirus  .figure  <dig>

. the phylogenetic inference was based on the concatenated amino acid sequences of the  <dig> core genes identified in all complete baculovirus genome sequences. we collapsed all the gammabaculovirus and alphaphabaculovirus. the cuninpv was used as root. erelgv  clustered with chocgv and both were closely related to piragv isolates.



betabaculovirusgene comparison
we performed blast comparisons between erelgv and all other full betabaculovirus genomes available in genbank using the cgview comparison tool  <cit>  and circos  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  most of the erelgv-encoded orfs are conserved among all betabaculovirus, but protein similarity varies widely across the species. some structural proteins, such as granulin and the per os infectivity factors , were the most conserved genes. conversely, f protein, the major betabaculovirus envelope fusion protein  and matrix metalloproteinase  were particularly variable despite of both being present in every betabaculovirus sequenced to date. the efp is essential for cell-to-cell movement and systemic virus spread  <cit> . gp <dig> is the efp found in group i alphabaculovirus and all orthologs are closely related to each other , whereas the f protein, found in both alpha and betabaculovirus  <cit> , is very diverse . interestingly, deletion of the gp <dig> or f protein genes is lethal for bv propagation in autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus   <cit>  and helicoverpa armigera nuclepolyhedrovirus   <cit> , respectively. the deficiency can be rescued by efp homologs from many different viruses in the case of acmnpv  <cit> , but the opposite is not true; acmnpv gp <dig> is not able to completely rescue an efp-deleted hanpv. however, it is not clear why the f protein from plutella xylostella granulovirus  is not able to rescue the infectivity of gp64-null acmnpv  <cit>  but that from agsegv can. plxygv causes systemic infection to the diamondback moth p. xylostella  larvae  <cit>  and agsegv infects the cutworm a. segetum   <cit> . thus, the betabaculovirus efp variability might reflect the cell machinery adjustment at the insect family level considering that acmnpv infects caterpillar from the same insect family of a. segetum. a second highly variable gene, mmp, is a proteinase able to produce a distinct pattern of melanization in bombyx mori larvae infected with the xestia c-nigrum granulovirus  metalloproteinase-expressing bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus  <cit> . the enzyme is thought to enhance, replace, or act synergistically with proteins from virus or host playing an important role in the virus spread  <cit> . this variability is not unexpected since granulovirus genomes vary in content with respect to the presence or absence of the proteases cathepsin and enhancin genes and also the chitinase gene .figure  <dig> 
gene comparison of erelgv genome and all completely sequenced betabaculoviruses available in genbank. cds identities were acquired by blast analysis and ranked from  <dig> to 100%. from the outermost ring: chocgv, piragv-e <dig>  piragv-china, clangv, calgv, crlegv, cypogv, adorgv, phopgv, epapgv, agsegv, plxygv, psungv, xecngv, heargv, and spligv-k <dig>  for this representation, gene synteny is not taken into account. cds that were absent in the erelgv genome but present in the query sequences were not displayed. to prevent the missing of known homologues, like p <dig>  and odv-e <dig> , all the low identity hits  were plotted as well. unique genes are shown in red, core genes are in boldface, and densovirus-related genes are shown in green.



lack of cathepsinand chitinasegenes
erelgv lacks cathepsin and chitinase genes, despite of their importance for promoting baculovirus horizontal transmission  <cit> . this feature can explain the integrity of caterpillar flesh and light color after death . other betabaculovirus genomes also lack both enzymes: complete deletion in chocgv  <cit> , adoxophyes orana granulovirus   <cit> , phthorimaea opercullela granulovirus  , plxygv  <cit>  and spodoptera litura granulovirus   <cit> ; cryptophlebia leucotreta granulovirus   <cit>  chitinase has an interruption; and in helicoverpa armigera granulovirus   <cit>  only cathepsin is absent. interestingly, most of these deletions seem to have occurred independently of each other within betabaculovirus , aside from chocgv and erelgv in which is strongly supported an ancestral lacking. thus, it is reasonable to expect that anbigv, the closest relative to erelgv, might also lack both cathepsin and chitinase. taken together, these results reinforce the notion that both genes are most likely non-essential for the persistence of baculoviruses in the environment. conversely, previous work from our research team has shown that introduction of cathepsin and chitinase from choristoneura fumiferana defective nucleopolyhedrovirus into agmnpv  increases pathogenicity and occlusion body production relative to the wild type virus  <cit> .

dutpase-likegene
erelorf- <dig> codes for a nucleotide metabolism-related gene homologous to orgyia pseudotsugata multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus  orf- <dig>  the gene seems to be composed of a fusion between two distinct orfs; the c-terminal portion is related to a baculovirus thymidylate kinase-like gene and the n-terminal portion is related to several dutpase-like genes. the thymidylate kinase enzyme catalyzes a critical step in the biosynthesis of deoxythymidine triphosphate  <cit> . dutpase catalyses dutp dephosphorylation to generate dump  <cit> . high levels of dutp can be deleterious for virus genomic dna replication since dttp can be substituted for dutp during dna synthesis  <cit> . a high dutp/dttp ratio promotes uracil incorporation into dna. uracils in dna are then targeted by uracil dna glycosylase and excised, leading to futile repair cycles and dna breakage and or translesional dna synthesis  <cit> . nucleotide metabolism-related enzyme acquisition is common in baculoviruses  <cit>  and could avoid this deleterious response by decreasing the dutp/dttp ratio, however how these genes alter the virus fitness is not clear  <cit> .

the he65-like and p43-like genes
the erelgv genome contains homologues of the he <dig> and p <dig> genes. homologues of he <dig> are harbored by several alphabaculoviruses, four betabaculoviruses , heargv, pseudaletia unipuncta granulovirus , and xestia c-nigrum granulovirus ), and two betaentomopoxviruses . this gene is a member of a distinct rna ligase family related to the t <dig> rna ligase gp63-like gene and is present in all the domains of life   <cit> . the alignment of baculovirus and entomopoxvirus he65-like genes revealed large, independent, and recurrent deletions in the c-terminal region , which contain five nucleotidyl transferase motifs  <cit> . the amino-terminal region was highly conserved although no previously characterized motifs were present. we performed a phylogenetic reconstruction based on this conserved domain. the he <dig> reconstruction revealed distinct horizontal gene transfer  events from alphabaculovirus to betabaculovirus and betaentomopoxvirus . betabaculovirus likely endured two independent acquisitions from group ii alphabaculovirus in distinct genomic regions:  a synapomorphic introduction for heargv, psungv, and xecngv ; and  an additional gain for agsegv . importantly, support for agsegv branch is low. however, the genomic context of the gene is conserved among heargv, psungv, and xecngv but not in agsegv , reinforcing our hypothesis that two independent introductions occurred. likewise, betaentomopoxvirus homologues were probably acquired from group ii alphabaculovirus . remarkably, erelgv is the first betabaculovirus with a he65-like gene  acquired from group i alphabaculovirus. it is not clear whether c-terminal deleted he <dig> remains functional in baculovirus. however the maintenance of the amino-terminal region indicates that this gene region is under positive selection pressure.figure  <dig>

furthermore, we found in erelgv genome a p43-like gene  whose homologues were found only in baculovirus species from the genus alphabaculovirus  with conserved amino acid sequence and position in the genome  <cit> . deletion of p <dig> in acmnpv does not affect virus replication in cell culture and the reason for gene acquisition and preservation is not clear  <cit> . two hypotheses can be raised for p <dig> introduction in erelgv:  erelgv acquired the p43-like gene from group i alphabaculovirus, specifically from acmnpv-related viruses; or  erelgv acquired from group ii alphabaculovirus, specifically from a baculovirus  during co-infection of a sphingid host.

acquisitions of densovirus-related genes in betabaculovirus
erelorf- <dig> and erelorf- <dig> are homologues to a non-structural densovirus gene. densovirus-related genes were previously described in two betabaculoviruses, chocgv   <cit>  and crlegv   <cit> , and one gammabaculovirus , neodiprion lecontei nucleopolyhedrovirus   <cit> . the latter did not match the other two homologues , suggesting these genes resulted from at least two hgt events between densoviruses and baculoviruses. despite the limited number of densovirus genomes available, we performed a phylogenetic analysis to help understand the origins of betabaculovirus homologues. we found that the genes were dispersed over the phylogenetic tree, suggestive of multiple hgt events. as shown in figure  <dig>  betabaculovirus homologues did not form a monophyletic cluster. to further substantiate our findings, we compared the likelihood of the observed tree to that estimated assuming a betabaculovirus monophyletic clade . indeed, the likelihood ratio test rejected the monophyletic hypothesis favoring the multiple-hgt scenario, which was also supported by the distinct genomic context observed for the homologous betabaculovirus genes . moreover, both erelorf- <dig> and erelorf- <dig> form a well-supported clade, indicating that they probably represent a gene duplication event during erelgv evolution.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
erelgv is a new betabaculovirus species closely related to chocgv and piragv isolates. its genome encodes  <dig> orfs, eight of which are unique. we found evidence suggesting horizontal gene transfers from alphabaculovirus and densovirus to betabaculovirus. the he65-like gene was independently acquired tree times from alphabaculovirus. we found a dutpase-like gene homologous to opmnpv orf- <dig> and two densovirus-related genes. the contribution of these genes to baculovirus fitness is not clear and is being experimentally tested in our lab. importantly, recombination events between insect viruses from unrelated families and genera might drive baculovirus genomic evolution.
