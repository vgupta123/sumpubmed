BACKGROUND
hulless barley  is one of the most important crops in china, especially in tibet plateau, for over half of the total food production. with caryopses that thresh free from the pales, hulless  barley provides an attractive advantage for the human consumption  <cit> . it is cultivated in the valleys and in the higher land on tibet. drought-induced water deficit greatly affects crop growth and development, and endangers crop agronomic yields. crops have also formed various molecular and physiological changes to prevent water deficit. drought tolerance crops maintain turgor and continue metabolism in cells even at low water potential, mainly by protoplasmic tolerance, synthesis of osmolytes or/and compatible solutes  <cit> . signal transduction molecules play important roles in this process by mediating the transmission of the stress signals via complex signal transduction pathways. numerous fundamental molecular aspects of tetrapyrroles and abscisic acid  are available . tetrapyrroles are the active cores of some compounds with crucial biochemical roles in living systems, such as chlorophyll, heme, siroheme and phytochromobilin  <cit> . heme biosynthesis is transcriptionally responsive to reactive oxygen species -mediated stress signaling in arabidopsis  <cit> . aba is a vital stress-responsive phytohormone sensitive to these cellular changes, particularly to the loss of turgor  <cit> . the aba signal transduction pathway comprises the aba-bound pyrabactin resistance/regulatory component of aba receptor  proteins  <cit> , type 2c protein phosphatases   <cit> , and snf1-related kinases   <cit> , nced  <cit> , abf  <cit> , myb/myc  <cit> , ap2/erf family  <cit> , lea  <cit>  and dhn  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the molecular drought response mechanism can be divided into aba-dependent and aba-independent pathways  <cit> . in soybean, aba treatment influences the expression of drought response genes  <cit> .

breeding for drought tolerance is particularly challenging because of the genetic complexity of this trait. on the one hand, hulless barley has a complex diploid genome , with the genome size of 5000 mb, larger than that of human  <cit> . on the other hand, drought tolerance has been well documented to result from cooperative interactions among multiple morphological, physiological, and biochemical characters. different genotypes may have diverse responses to drought stress  <cit> . therefore, efficient improvement requires an indepth understanding of the gene expression regulation mechanisms in response to drought stress.

many researchers have analyzed tibetan hulless barley, and many genes associated with drought stress responses in plants are known. honsdorf et al.  <cit>  has detected the drought tolerance qtl in wild barley, while chen et al.  <cit>  has analyzed grain development and nutrient storage in tibetan hulless barley. however, little has been known about display the changes of gene expression in tibetan hulless barley during the whole drought response process. in the study, we used transcriptome-seq to identify differentially expressed genes in response to drought stress in leaf tissue of a tibetan hulless barley drought-resistibility cultivar, which were grown in different levels of relative soil moisture content  and water recovery. this analysis serves as a reference for future studies on tibetan hulless barley response to various stresses, such as to drought, cold and salt.

RESULTS
analysis of transcriptome-seq data
in the present study, cdna libraries were constructed from leaves harvested at eight days after drought stress and during rehydration with three biological replicates, and then sequenced using the illumina hiseq™  <dig> platform. after cleaning and checking the read quality, we obtained almost  <dig>  billion 200 bp paired-end clean reads. among the clean reads, 100 % had quality scores at the cycle q <dig> level . the statistics of sequencing sample and data were in table  <dig> table  <dig> statistics of transcriptome sequencing data in different samples



the clean reads of each sample  were mapped to the full gene set of tibetan hulless barley. the  <dig> transcriptome data could map to  <dig>  genes, which covered  <dig>  % of the whole gene-set.

degs analysis and validation of hulless barley sequencing data
samples a <dig>  d <dig>  c <dig>  d <dig>  e <dig> and f <dig> were divided into two groups: one includes a <dig>  b <dig> and c <dig>  which is under water-sufficient conditions; the other consists of d <dig>  e <dig> and f <dig>  which is under withholding water conditions. then, the comparison analysis between the two groups was performed use noiseq method, and  <dig> degs were finally obtained. the pairwise comparison was also executed among samples f <dig>  g <dig>  h <dig> and i <dig>  we filtered genes whose rpkm value are below five in all four samples and removed genes that the frequency of occurrence is less than three in pairwise comparison, and then we got  <dig> degs.

among these degs, genes with distinctly changed expression profiling were confirmed using qpcr . the results of this experiment were basically consistent with rna-seq data.fig.  <dig> expression of  <dig> differentially expressed genes in response to drought stress treatment. vertical bar charts with simple error bars  represent quantitation of  <dig> genes transcripts in nine samples, using qpcr. values are means ± se . line and scatter plot  represents transcript abundance  of nine samples for each gene detected by rna-seq. the a1-f <dig> indicates the relative soil moisture content  of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively, and g7-i <dig> indicates the 2 h, 4 h and 8 h after water recovery from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %, respectively

go and kegg analyze degs
the combination of above two strategies results in a final  <dig> degs. we then conducted go annotation and kegg pathway analysis of these  <dig> genes. the assigned functions of these genes covered a broad range of go categories . under the cellular component category, the parts of membrane-bounded organelle, cytoplasmic membrane-bounded vesicle, intrinsic to membrane, cytoplasmic part, intracellular part, plastid part, chloroplast part were prominently represented. under the category of molecular function, the parts of catalytic activity, transferase activity, transferring phosphorus-containing groups, ion binding, cation binding, oxidoreductase activity represented the majorities of the category. for the biological process category, many genes were classified into the oxidation-reduction process, protein phosphorylation, phosphorus metabolic process, phosphate-containing compound metabolic process, regulation of biological process, biological regulation, transport, and cellular ketone metabolic process. go enrichment of nine clusters were illustrated in fig.  <dig>  of the listed twenty-one go terms, majority go terms fell into cluster ix. tetrapyrrole binding, photosystem and photosynthetic membrane were the most affected in cluster ix. only one go term was included in cluster i and cluster viii, respectively. go terms focused on cellular component category, whereas degs were almost balanced distribution in three categories.fig.  <dig> go annotation of these  <dig> genes in each category. x-axis indicates go terms, while the y-axis indicates the percent of dges

drought defense-related genes and pathways
we also analyzed the genes related to aba-dependent and independent signaling pathway of drought stress responses, including nced, pyr/pyl/rcar, snrk <dig>  abf, myb/myc, and ap2/erf transcription factors. the typical aba-dependent and independent signaling pathways responsive to drought stress was illustrated in fig. 6a. the pathways were described by mustilli et al.  <cit>  and yoshida et al.  <cit> . almost all genes were up-regulated except pp2c down-regulated. dehydration first induced the expression of nced in chloroplast and ca2+ accumulation in nucleus. aba biosynthesis induction of nced triggered pyr/pyl/rcar and myb/myc. pyr/pyl/rcar located both in nucleus and the outside blocked the expression of snrk <dig> by inhibiting pp2c synthesis. snrk <dig> located in cytoplasm may accelerate the expression of slac <dig> but repress the expression of kat <dig> located in cell wall, and then result in stomatal closure. this was one response formation in cytoplasm to drought. ap2/erf caused by ca2+ accumulation, abf acted by snrk <dig>  and myb/myc induced by aba together promoted the expression of lea and dhn in nucleus, and finally mediated drought response. figure 6b exhibited the expression pattern of representative genes allocated in fig. 6a mentioned pathways. the expression of nced dramatically decreased during water recovery. pyr/pyl/rcar, pp2c, and myc still kept a relative balance expression. the expression of myb, lea, dhn rapidly increased when rsmc reached  <dig>  %. all genes presented an abundant expression during the rsmc maintained from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %.fig.  <dig> expression of stress adaptation related genes. a, the typical aba-dependent and independent signaling pathways responsive to drought stress. red and blue ellipses indicate up-regulated and down-regulated genes identified by transcriptomes under drought stress, respectively. a was described by mustilli et al.  <cit>  and yoshida et al.  <cit> . b, the expression pattern of representative genes allocated in above mentioned pathways. the expression levels were assessed by log2-transformed rpkm values. the a1-f <dig> indicates the relative soil moisture content  of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively, and g7-i <dig> indicates the 2 h, 4 h and 8 h after water recovery from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %, respectively. nced, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase; snrk <dig>  snf1-related protein kinase 2; abf, areb/abf, myb/myc, ap2/erf, transcription factors, lea, late embryogenesis abundant protein; dhn, dehydrin. the number below each gene indicates the member of each gene family



discussion
drought, salinity and cold are the major environmental factors impacting on survival and productivity of hulless barley in tibetan plateau of china. barley is known to be relatively tolerant to abiotic stresses among the major cereal crops and, thus, is often grown in more marginal sites  <cit> . tibetan hulless barley cultivar, himalaya  <dig>  has developed a strong tolerance and adaptation to drought deficit. using high-throughput rna sequencing technology, we compared in detail the transcriptional differences and overlap between different levels of rsmc and water recovery, and display the changes of gene expression in tibetan hulless barley during the whole drought response process.

in this study, the mrna of himalaya  <dig> with good drought tolerance was sequenced using illumina hiseq™  <dig> in the manner of pe <dig>  with sera-mag magnetic oligo  beads. a clear bioinformatic map of mrna involved in multiple biological processes was produced. as a result,  <dig>  g clean reads were collected from nine samples under different rsmc and water recovery, which met the requirements for further analysis. saturability analysis indicated a qualified coverage of most genes based on our data size. in addition, the clean reads of q <dig> occupied over than 95 % of the total, suggesting high quality sequencing. tophat package was used to blast the transripome data to the tibetan hulless barley. it has been found that  <dig>  % of the reads were mapped to the reference genome. major mapping reads indicated reliable transcriptome data. these non-mapped tags most likely represent regions where the reference genome is incomplete  <cit> , or there are allelic sequence differences between the reference genome and the cultivar himalaya  <dig> used in this study. another reason may be that rna-seq data for reference genome annotation should represent all major tissue types, developmental stages and responses to abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> .

dge global analysis provided a comprehensive dataset responding to drought stress in leaves of hulless barley seedlings. we identified nine clusters for all dges and coarsely assigned them to  <dig> functional categories  . interestingly, there were no other overlapping go functional enrichments between clusters except catalytic activity, membrane, vesicle, indicating that these genes of different clusters were predicted to be involved in many plant biological processes, including defense  <cit> . these go functions were enriched in ix cluster . tetrapyrrole binding, photosystem and photosynthetic membrane were the most affected in ix cluster. the former finding implied that tetrapyrroles were the structural backbone of chlorophyll and heme were essential for primary photochemistry, light harvesting, and electron transport  <cit> . tetrapyrrole-binding proteins of chbp <dig> and chbp <dig> have properties suitable for tetrapyrrole carrier proteins  <cit> . tetrapyrrole binding protein of genomes uncoupled  <dig>  regulates chlorophyll synthesis and plastid-to-nucleus signal transduction by binding both the product and the substrate of mg-chelatase, an enzyme that produces magnesium-protoporphyrin ix   <cit> . tetrapyrrole biosynthesis had recently been implicated in wilting avoidance  <cit> . heme mediated chloroplast-to-nucleus signalling upon drought stress  <cit> . enhanced tetrapyrrole biosynthesis was likely to confer drought tolerance via retrograde signaling and induction of drought-responsive gene expression  <cit> .

pathway enrichment analysis revealed  <dig> pathways were significantly affected by drought stress . plant hormone signal transduction pathway, for instance, aba signal transduction pathway was a significant different during the whole drought response process in our study. transcription factors of nced, pyr/pyl/rcar, pp2c, snrk <dig> located in cytoplasm together lead to stomatal response and then transcription factors of pyr/pyl/rcar, pp2c, snrk <dig>  abf, myb/myc, ap2/erf, lea, and dhn located in nucleus, together mediated drought response . soil drying first inducted aba release in roots and then was distributed throughout the plant via the transpiration stream  <cit> . aba induced reduction of leaf growth rate and stomatal closure, which triggered stress proteins and various metabolites to protect cells against drought stress  <cit>  when aba was produced endogenously via water deficit, and then plant tolerance to drought was increased . drought stress signals can also be generated by osmotic stress-induced ca2+ expansion, which promoted ca2+ channels and induces protein kinases and resulted in drought-responsive gene expression . du et al.  <cit>  has compared dhn between wild barley and tibetan hulless barley associated with drought stress resistance. liang et al.  <cit>  indicated that lea genes  might participate in adaptive responses to water deficit in different ways in tibetan hulless barley. qian et al.  <cit>  indicate that the differential hva <dig> gene has a functional role in the dehydration tolerance in tibetan hulless barley.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study provided a comprehensive analysis of drought-responsive genes and transcriptome expression profiles of tibetan hulless barley leaves by combined dge, rna-seq, and computational approaches. our results revealed  <dig> potentially drought-responsive genes in tibetan hulless barley. we analyzed the genes related to aba-dependent and independent signaling pathway of drought stress responses. additionally, we also observed the genes related to tetrapyrrole binding of drought stress responses. this result filled up drought-resistant related genes in tibetan hulless barley in the available literature. characterizing the components of these pathways will contribute to improve drought tolerance in tibetan hulless barley.
