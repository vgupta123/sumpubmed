BACKGROUND
avian leukosis virus  is an oncogenic retrovirus that induced lymphoid tumors in chickens and its genomic structure and molecular characteristics are well defined. it plays a critical role in the discoveries of reverse transcriptase, v-oncogenes and proto-oncogenes  <cit> . according to the host range, viral envelope interference and cross-neutralization patterns, avian leukosis viruses  are classified into six subgroup  in chickens. alv-j was first detected in meat-type chickens in the late 1980’s  <cit> , and then spread globally . so far, alv-j is more pathogenic and mutate easily than other subgroups  <cit> . although the eradication programs on alv-j have been conducted in meat-type chickens since its discovery, it had spread into egg-type stock and the chinese local breeds, which caused significant economic losses in china during the last 10 years .

proteins gp <dig> and gp <dig> are encoded by the envelope gene of alv, while gp <dig> protein constitute globular structures on the surface of the virus, which is closely associated with the process of viral binding and determine the specificity of subgroups. to understand molecular epidemiology of alv-j among different types of chickens with various genetic backgrounds in many parts of the world, more than  <dig> alv-j isolates have been subsequently sequenced and compared with gp <dig> region of envelope gene since late 1980s . the early study suggested that gp <dig> sequences of the alv-j strains isolated from different geographical areas and farms in different years showed highly variable and their similarity varied in the range of  <dig> – 100%. in terms of the gp <dig> identity, the later isolates seemed to deviate gradually from the earliest isolate hprs- <dig>  <cit> . however, many new isolates were obtained from different provinces of china after  <dig>  we found that no further deviate from hprs- <dig> and all of their gp <dig> sequences still varied in the same range  <cit> . there was also no evidence to show further sequence deviation from hprs- <dig> even for the alv-j strains isolated in the recent 10 years from layers or chinese local breeds of chickens  <cit> . in addition, among  <dig> alv-j isolates from ten individual layers with myelocytomas from the same flock demonstrated that they varied in the range of  <dig> – <dig> % in gp <dig> region  <cit> . it seemed to suggest that there was no close relationship between alv-j gp <dig> homology levels and its pathogenicity or adaptation to different chicken breeds with different genetic backgrounds, although there were some epidemic phenomena indicated that alv-j evolved to higher pathogenicity in different breeds of chickens.

in the past 30 years, almost all the molecular epidemiological data have been obtained by sequencing dna fragments amplified and cloned from alv-j infected cef or df <dig> cells. such process would set up a bias for selection of certain quasispecies from the large population of viral particles in the given pathologic materials, for instance tumor tissues. by such selection, some significant variants associated with pathogenicity or adaptation to different genetic breeds may be survived by selective pressures. wellehan reported that the dominant variants of san miguel sea lion virus populations altered significantly after its replication ecosystem switched from infected sea lions to cell cultures for  <dig> passages, the rare variants in sea lions became the dominant ones in cell cultures  <cit> .

in this study, we analyzed and quantitatively compared dominant variants between alv-j population replicated in infected chickens and cell cultures with the aid of deep sequencing-based method. the purpose of this study is to advance in understanding if cell culture ecosystem would cause selection pressures different from that of chickens with alv-j infection, and whether the selection pressures would influence the evolution of alv dominant variants. with these studies, we hope to identify specific epitopes or domains on gp <dig>  or other genes, such as in the region of ltr-u <dig>  which may associate with the differential selective pressures.

methods
sample preparation
the avian cell line df- <dig> were obtained from the american type culture collection . these cells were grown in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium  supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 mg/ml of penicillin and streptomycin. a liver with myloid tumors was collected aseptically from clinically hy-line variety brown with spontaneous infections and identified as alv-j via virus isolation . tumor homogenate prepared in plasma-free dmem was lysed, the supernatant was purified by high-speed centrifugation and  <dig> -um-pore-size cellulose—acetate filtration. the resultant purified tumor suspension was designated as original liver suspension  which was used as the viral strain in laboratory experiments, and the concentration was about  <dig> tcid50/ <dig> ul.

in vitro group,  <dig> tcid <dig> ori were inoculated into df- <dig> cells in logarithmic phase and maintained for 5 days as one passage. then the infected df <dig> cells were cultured via serial passages and cell free cultured supernatants were harvested at the 1st and 5th passage . in vivo group, a total of  <dig> one-day-old specific pathogen free  chickens from the spafas co.  were inoculated intraperitoneally with  <dig> tcid <dig> ori. the blood plasma collections were performed for virus isolation, while antibodies of alv-j were detected at  <dig>   <dig> and 6 weeks post inoculation, respectively. following inoculation, plasma was obtained from whole blood and stored at −80 °c. two plasma samples free of antibody at 2 weeks of sampling and the cell culture from the 1st and 5th passages were chosen for high throughput sequencing . the animal infection protocol was reviewed and approved by the shandong province animal ethics committee.

rna extraction, rt-pcr and sequencing
total viral rna was extracted from samples of two ecosystems and original liver inoculum  using magmax viral rna isolation kit  following the manufacturer’s instructions. each sample was amplified using a forward primer with a six-digit error-correcting barcode as described earlier  <cit> . in addition, a 2-bp gt linker was added between the barcode and the 5′end of the forward primer to avoid a potential match between the barcode and the target sequences. therefore, the forward primer was barcode-gt-primer, in which the barcode indicates the six barcode sequences that are specific to different samples, then three pairs of primers were designed according to the reference sequence hprs- <dig> , namely gp85-a, gp85-b and ltr-u <dig> . alv-specific rt-pcr targeting the hypervariable region of the gp <dig> and ltr-u <dig> genes were then performed on the viral rna using the two-step rt-pcr kit  at 42 °c for 45 min, 5 min denaturation at 95 °c, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °c for 5 min, 95 °c for 30 s; annealing at 53 °c for 30 s, and extension at 72 °c for 30 s, with a final extension step at 72 °c for 10 min. the pcr products from both rounds were run of this reaction on a 1% agarose gels and scored. bands of interest in the gels were cut out and the dna was extracted from the gel using qiagen quick gel extraction kit. the products were quantified with a nanodropnd- <dig> spectrophotometer . a mixture of the amplicons was then used for sequencing on illumina miseq platform according to the manufacturer’s instructions at the beijing genomics institute . a base-calling pipeline  was used to process the raw fluorescent images and the call sequences, and data quality assessment were performed on the miseq instrument.

data analysis
raw nucleotide sequences were filtered, aligned, trimmed and translated using pre-specified criteria applied uniformly. on average, there are 95% of the data above a quality value of q <dig>  which demonstrates a good quality of the demultiplexed reads. then switch nucleic acid sequences of a, b fragment into amino acid sequences and threw away sequences with no biological significance for the following analysis . the dominant gp <dig> and ltr-u <dig> variants of the samples were compared with each other under different infectious ecosystems using the clustal w algorithm in megalign program of the dnastar package. transcriptional regulatory elements in the u <dig> region were analyzed by the online service system of nsite  of soft berry . the statistical analysis was done by duncan’s multiple range test.

in order to investigate quasispecies diversity under different ecosystems, we calculated the shannon entrophy using clean reads of each sample.

to minimize potential sampling bias and reduce the computation load, we performed a bootstrapping strategy for the clean reads of each sample. for each re-sampling with replacement, phylogenetic analysis was performed using raxml  <cit>  with  <dig> bootstrap replicates, under the gammacat substitution model. all other parameters were set to their default values. global selection pressure values  were estimated using hyphy method  <cit> .

RESULTS
miseq high throughput sequencing data
after several filtering steps, about  <dig> to 97% of the nucleic acid sequences  or 86–93% of the amino acid sequences  from any sample of the raw reads were retained for subsequent analyses. the raw reads and the filtered reads obtained using miseq high-throughput sequencing of the extracted rna generated a median of more than  <dig>  reads per sample .

comparison of the ratios of haplotypes in different viral infectious ecosystems
the ratios of sequence haplotypes to total valid reads for gp85-a, gp85-b and ltr-u <dig> fragments from both plasmas of two chickens  and df <dig> cell culture supernatants of two different passages  were decreased significantly as compared to that of the original liver inoculum  . the results suggested there might be some selective pressures on quasispecies of both gp85-a , gp85-b  and ltr-u <dig> fragments when alv-j from the ori replicated in chickens or in df <dig> cell cultures. some variants in ori were decreased dramatically to undetectable levels when replication ecosystem changed.

evolutionary dynamics of gp85-b  under different infectious ecosystems
the dominant variants of gp85-b altered dramatically after replication under the two different ecosystems. the percentage of the most dominant variant of gp85-b in ori decreased to a very low level and even became undetectable in infected chickens or cell culture supernatants, while some other sub-dominant variants were increased and decreased at a high and low percentages . actually, the top  <dig> dominant variants in chicken plasmas or cell cultures were rare ones in ori . it suggested that there were some strong selective pressures having influence on the evolution of dominant variants of gp85-b from infectious ecosystems.fig.  <dig> evolutionary dynamics of gp85-b dominant quasispecies of alv-j under different infectious ecosystems. a percentages of the first  <dig> dominant quasispecies of gp85-b in the ori and their equals in cell culture supernatants of 5th passage . ori = black bars; chickens # <dig>  and # <dig>  plasmas = red bars. x-axis represents the first  <dig> dominant quasispecies of gp85-b in the original inoculum ordered based their ranks. y-axis represents their percentages from total valid reads in each samples collected under different replication ecosystem. b percentages of the first  <dig> dominant quasispecies of gp85-b in cell culture supernatants of 5th passage  and their equals in the ori. chickens # <dig>  and # <dig>  plasmas = red bars; ori = black bars. c haplotypes’ rank and their percentages of the first  <dig> dominant quasispecies of gp85-b in cell culture supernatants of 5th passage, plasma samples, and in the ori. p5 = the cell culture supernatant samples of 5th passages; chicken 1 = plasma of # <dig> infected chicken; chicken 2 = plasma of # <dig> infected chicken, ori = original liver inoculum. d the gp85-b amino acid alignment of the first  <dig> dominant quasispecies for viral samples collected in different replication ecosystyms. the dots indicate identical residues; the letter indicate amino acid substitutions; the dashes indicate gaps produced in the alignment; the blue square indicates two known variable regions  and a new possible variable region x. the most dominant quasispecies  in the original inoculum  is used as the reference sequence on the top line corresponding to the amino acids sites #163- <dig> of gp <dig> in alv-j prototype hprs- <dig> 




the most dominant variant  accounting for  <dig> % in the ori did not appear among the first  <dig> dominant quasipecies in either cell culture supernatants or chicken plasmas. we also find that there are two identical variants within the first  <dig> dominant variants of gp85-b from both chicken samples . sequences of the first dominant variant  from c <dig> and the fourth dominant variant  from c <dig> are 100% identical to the 64th variant  in the ori. similarly, the most dominant variant  from c <dig> and the 9th dominant variant  from c <dig> are 100% identical to the 10th dominant variant  in the ori . although the other  <dig> dominant variants are different between the two chicken samples, but they have high homologies and only limited number of different sites than those from cell culture supernatants .

characterization of a specific domain of gp85-b associated with selective evolution of dominant variants under different viral replication conditions
the differences of amino acids in gp85-b dominant variants under different viral replication conditions are mainly in two known variable regions hr <dig>  and vr <dig> , or a new possible variable region x . the most prominent difference is that the major dominant variants from chicken plasmas have a 3-peptides lsd repeat insert  when compared to samples from the ori or cell culture supernatants. although the evolutionary dynamics of lsd+ in two chickens are not the same. in the plasma of chicken # <dig> , all the top  <dig> dominant variants  accounting for  <dig> % from total valid reads get lsd+ at 2w post infection which is significantly increased compared to these equals in ori consisting of only  <dig> %. in another chicken , only one as the 4th dominant variant  with lsd+ appears in the top  <dig> dominant variants, which accounting for  <dig> % from the total valid reads, that was still a significant increase as the identical sequence haplotype  in ori was only  <dig> %. in contrast, there is no lsd+ in the top  <dig> dominant variants in cell culture, and only  <dig> haplotypes with lsd+ consisted of only  <dig> % in its total  <dig>  valid reads are found among  <dig> variants haplotypes, which was dramatically declined from  <dig> % when compared to that only  <dig> haplotypes from  <dig> variants haplotypes in ori.

all variants with lsd+ in different ecosystems were compared and analyzed. in c <dig>  the top  <dig> lsd+ dominant variants accounting for  <dig> % of the total valid reads, compared to only  <dig> % in the ori. while in c <dig>  the first  <dig> dominant variants with lsd+ consisted of  <dig> % of the total valid reads, but only  <dig> % in the ori. it indicates that variants with lsd+ were dramatically increased by positive selection after replication in chickens. specifically, there are three completely identical variants with lsd+ in two chicken plasma samples . however, evolution of variants with lsd+ are to the opposite direction after replication in df <dig> cell cultures, that is, percentages of lsd+ positive variants decline rapidly and even disappear. some lsd+ positive variants detected in infected chicken plasma are not detectable in the ori even all reads are analyzed . there are some amino acid alterations in x and vr <dig> regions, but such variations trend to be convergent . also two pairs of lsd+ positive and lsd+ negative variants are compared for their antigenic index by computational analysis. the results indicated that lsd+ significantly increased the antigenic index in the new domain around the lsd insert .fig.  <dig> comparison of the antigen index between the gp85-b quasispecies with or without lsd+. a the comparison of antigen index between  <dig>  and b <dig> . b the comparison of antigen index between b <dig>  and b <dig> . antigenic profiles calculated with jameson and wolf  algorithm from the linear amino acid sequences, the different area of antigen index with or without lsd insertion mutation was marked with a black frame




mutational analysis of gp85-b under different infectious ecosystems
by analyzing the data from deep sequencing, mutational frequency of each site in the lsd+ domain is also compared independently among gp85-b quasispecies of alv-j replicated in different ecosystems . each amino acid of l, s and d at the insertion sites  appears at the frequency of  <dig> – <dig> % in ori, but it dramatically decreases to 0– <dig> % after alv-j is passaged in df <dig> cells. in contrast, their frequencies were increased to  <dig> – <dig> % and  <dig> – <dig> % respectively in c <dig> and c <dig> which were very close to the frequency of  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the entire “lsd”, suggesting that the positive effect in infected chickens and negative selection in cell cultures were mainly associated with the intact 3-peptides insertion of lsd.fig.  <dig> comparison of amino acid changes in six sites on gp85-b under different infectious ecosystems. the first  <dig> frequent amino acids at each site and their percentages were listed for samples collected from the original inoculum. p1 = the 1st passage cell culture; p5 = the 5th passage cell culture; #1 = chicken 1; #2 = chicken  <dig>  the capital letters indicate specific amino acid. the numerical numbers indicate the sites of the gp85-b by use of the most dominant quasispecies in the original inoculum as the reference




besides, specific mutations of another  <dig> important sites in gp85-b were recognized to be associated with positive selective pressures in df <dig> cells. the proportions of variants consisted of the  <dig> none-successive amino acids g-y-s at aa positions # <dig>  # <dig> and # <dig> were significantly increased, to  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % in p <dig> and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % in p <dig> from  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % in ori, respectively . in contrast, the proportions were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % in c <dig> and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % in c <dig>  further analysis of sequence data in fig.  <dig> indicated that the 1st, 4th, 5thand 7th ones among the top  <dig> dominant variants in 5th passage cell culture contained the none-successive g-y-s and consisted  <dig> % of total reads, while two of the first  <dig> dominant variants in the original liver inoculum contained the g-y-s which accounting for only  <dig> % of total valid reads.

comparisons of the shannon entropy and global selection pressure values  under different infectious ecosystems
to roughly quantify the pressures that quasispesis underwent under different infectious ecosystems, we calculated the shannon entropy and the global selection pressure values . our results showed the shannon entropy in ori was the highest, but when inoculated into chickens or df <dig> cells different degree of decline were observed . on the global selection pressure values , those in cells were relatively stable at about  <dig> , bigger than that from the ori, but there were two different situations in the chickens ecosystem. specifically, the ω values of the quasispecies in c <dig> were higher than those in p <dig> and p <dig>  but the shannon entropy is lower. moreover, the ω values of the quasispecies in c <dig> were lower than those in p <dig> and p <dig>  however the shannon entropy is higher.table  <dig> the shannon entropy and global selection pressure values  under different infectious ecosystems

comparisons of dominant variants in ltr-u <dig> region under different infectious ecosystems
the high throughput sequencing of ltr-u <dig> region showed that the most dominant variants had not changed in both chicken plasmas and df <dig> cell culture supernatants when compared to the ori. however, the other sub-dominant variants of u <dig> region evolved into different directions under different infectious ecosystems, in vivo and cell cultures. there were  <dig> of the top  <dig> variants were exactly the same in two chicken plasma samples which consisted of  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the total valid reads in the two chickens respectively . but all the left  <dig> major dominant variants of u <dig> in cell cultures were completely different from those of chicken plasma.fig.  <dig> evolutionary dynamics of the first  <dig> dominant quansispecies of u <dig> fragment in different infectious ecosystems. a the first  <dig> dominant quasispecies haplotype  and their percentages of total valid reads in df <dig> cell cultures . cc1001 = the quasispecies ranked the first in segment c from chicken 1; o0 = the original liver inoculum; c2 = chicken 2; p1 = passage1; p5 = passage  <dig> in cell culture. the last  <dig> numbers represents their ranks in the quasispecies population in each sample. b base sequence alignment of the first  <dig> dominant quasispecies of u <dig> detected in each different infectious ecosystems. the reference sequence is the most dominant quasispecies in the original inoculum , corresponding to bases #122– <dig> of ltr of alv-j prototype strain hprs- <dig>  the dots indicate identical residues, while the letters indicate amino acid substitutions. the motifs as transcription regulatory elements were labeled on the top




sequence alignment analysis demonstrated that u <dig> region was more conservative in alv-j replicated in cell cultures than in infected chickens, as the other  <dig> major sub-dominant variants haplotypes from df <dig> cell culture supernatants had fewer mutations than that from  <dig> chicken plasma samples when compared to the most dominant variant common in different infectious ecosystems. more importantly, the most base alterations were located within some motifs as transcription regulatory elements  in samples from two chickens and the ori. there were eight common mutation sites and similar replacement in the ecosystems of the two chickens, and then c/ebp, sp <dig>  mef <dig> and sreb regulatory elements losing their integrity but made one more motif of e2bp due to the replacement of c to a at the site # <dig>  obviously, it is due to differences of infectious ecosystems.

discussion
the object of this study was to understand if there is any influence from different infectious ecosystems on alv-j dominant variants evolution. both chickens and df <dig> cell cultures were inoculated with the same ori. the rt-pcr products of each sample were directly sequenced and analyzed by the deep sequencing, it produced extreme large sequence data covering genome variants even at very low frequencies. with the technology progresses on diversity in quasispecies and its evolutionary dynamics were obtained under different immunoselective pressures, antiviral drugs, and various viruses, such as hiv , and hepatitis b, c, and e viruses  <cit>  and some animal viruses  <cit> .

deep sequencing generated a median of more than  <dig>  reads per sample, which were large enough to compare and understand the quasispecies diversity from these samples. the ratios of haplotypes/valid reads of  <dig> fragments from chickens and cell culture samples were decreased compared to the ori, suggesting that both infectious ecosystems demonstrated a negative selective effect on some quasispecies in the ori. among the  <dig> fragments sequenced, gp85-a fragment was less influenced by selective pressures, but gp85-b fragment was significantly influenced. some dominant variants in the ori was dramatically decreased in the inoculated chicken plasma and cell culture supernatant samples, but some very rare variants became the dominant ones. the results provided the direct experimental evidence that the infectious ecosystems would dramatically influenced the evolution of viral quasispecies. it is clear that the ori was liver suspension and its alv-j quasispecies mainly replicated in liver-associated cells, however, viruses in chicken plasmas or cell culture supernatant came from all kinds of sensitive cells in the body or replicated only in df <dig> cells after the ori was infected chickens or cell cultures. bioinformatic analysis results showed the shannon entropy in ori was the highest, but when inoculated into chickens or df <dig> cells different degree of decline were observed, which indicated there were some pressures in the ecosystems. on the global selection pressure values , there was a big individual difference in chickens, but relatively stable in df <dig> cells. there was significant difference  between the two groups from chickens and df <dig> cells, which also suggested different selective pressure in the two groups.

the envelope protein gp <dig> is related to recognition and adhesion to sensitive cells, and also is the major antigen for viral neutralization  <cit> . the diversity in gp <dig> sequence, especially epitopes at certain sites may influence the tropism of virus quasispecies to different types of cells in chicken body. for example, it has been reported that alv-j prototype hprs- <dig> has a low tropism for bursal follicles cells but does replicate well in cultured blood monocytes  <cit> . the most interesting result in this study is the discovery of the 3-peptides “lsd” repeat insertion  in novel dominant variants of gp85-b fragments emerging in chicken plasmas samples, which increased the antigen index in the sub-region. however, there was no lsd+ positive variants among the top  <dig> dominant variants in two df <dig> supernatant samples. referencing to the principle of site-by-site positive selection analysis using the two rate fixed-effects likelihood  method  <cit> , after artificial calculation we found that the lsd+ were under positive selection in chickens, while negative selection in df <dig> cells. it might help to explain how evolution of different variants with specific epitope could be influenced by some selective pressures from ecosystem or its infectious ecosystems such as different organs, tissues or cell types. we speculate that variation in gp <dig> sequence similarity may not necessarily reflect its relationship to evolution in terms of higher pathogenicity to different genetic breeds of chickens, but some specific epitopes or domains on gp <dig> would influence.


ltr-u <dig> region of alv has only about 250 bp but contains several biological active motifs and enhancers influencing transcription and virus replication  <cit> , also it is a fragment easy to mutate on the alv genome. however, analysis of deep sequencing data of u <dig> region in different samples demonstrated that the viral population in chicken plasma samples came from alv-j replicated in different types of cells, organs and tissues of the chicken and experienced quite different ecosystem selection pressures. chicken plasma samples and df <dig> supernatant sample had the same most dominant variants of u <dig> as the ori, which indicated that different infectious ecosystems did not have as high selective pressures on the evolution of u <dig> quasispecies as that of gp85-b. but in the two chicken plasmas there were  <dig> absolutely identical variants for the top  <dig> sub-advantage variants while no reapeat with the top  <dig> sub-dominant variants in cell culture. although the first  <dig> dominant u <dig> variants were very conservative in cell culture supernatants, several sub-dominant variants from chicken plasma samples and ori had mutations in its regulation elements c\ebp, sp <dig>  mef <dig> and sreb. concerning the biological significance, its needs to be further investigated and studied.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study is the first to explore the replication of alv-j in different ecosystem using deep sequencing technique. we found that significant differences in dominant variants and their evolution dynamics of gp <dig> from alv-j in infected chickens or cell cultures. especially, a tri-peptides “lsd” insert associated with positive selective pressures in infected chickens and negative selective pressures in df <dig> cell cultures in gp <dig> were identified. it suggests that the replication ecosystem has a significant influence on the evolution of viruses. the molecular epidemiology studies based on the isolated alv-j in cell culture may not represent the true evolution of these viruses in infected chicken flocks in the field.
