BACKGROUND
escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus are major pathogenic bacteria infectious to poultry. e. coli causes the colibacillosis such as acute septicaemia, vitelline peritonitis, enteritis, genital diseases, and so forth, its morbidity and lethality are the highest in bacterial diseases of chicks in china  <cit> . the pathogen is currently treated by antibiotics, but its resistance against antibiotics can be easily acquired, and antibiotics lead to the deficiency of therapeutic effects  <cit> . s. aureus can cause acute septicaemia, arthritis, chick omphalitis, cutaneous necrosis and periostitis, and it is another pathogen leading great economic losses to the animal husbandry in china  <cit> . it is also easy to acquire drug resistance; especially methicillin resistant s. aureus  is resistant to most of antibiotics. the resistance against antibiotics becomes great threat to animals and human being, and it is meaningful to find out the antibiotic substitute to reduce the usage of antibiotics. herbs and plants offer plenty of compounds, which may replace antibiotics with strong antibacterial activities.

camellia oleifera, an evergreen plant, mainly grows in the middle region of china. its seeds are used for the extraction of edible oil. the yield of the seeds dramatically increases in recent years because of plant edible oil requirement and cultivation, the production of defatted seeds is up to  <dig>  tons per year  <cit> . although the defatted seeds are rich in active compounds  <cit> , they have been discarded without isolation and further exploitation. the total flavonoids, saponins and polysaccharides were detected in seeds of camellia oleifera with the contents of 1– <dig>  10– <dig> and 15–20 % respectively . the effective utilization of them will provide large amount of bioactive products. it is valuable to extract them for industrialization.

our previous research has found that the extract of camellia oleifera seeds have lots of pharmacological effects such as antioxidation, anti-inflammation and analgesia, which are mainly due to the saponin  <cit> . it is possible to develop the saponin extract as antibiotic substitute for animal husbandry because of its abundant and cheap resource.

in order to evaluate its effect and discuss the mechanism, the saponin was isolated from the defatted seeds of c. oleifera with structural identification. its efficacy was evaluated by amoxicillin-resistant e. coli and erythromycin-resistant s. aureus induced infection in chicks. bacterial biofilm formation is an important reason for the resistance against antibiotics, recurrence and difficulty to control by chemicals  <cit> . the action mechanism was revealed by inhibitory effect of the saponin on biofilm formation through interaction with mannitol dehydrogenase  activity and extracellular dna .

RESULTS
purity of the extract and structure of the purified compound
natural saponins generally exist in forms of glycosides, and different kinds of glycosides of saponin have been found in seeds of c. oleifera  <cit> . saponin glycosides are soluble in water and aqueous solvents. the extracts are the mixture of different glycosides, which can be achieved by current technique  <cit> . hcl aqueous solution with ultrasonic extraction applied in our research can hydrolyze saponin glycosides into sapogenin, which are insoluble in water and easily isolated by precipitation to get the purified products.

average yield of the saponin extract was  % by the separation technique in three repetitions. purity of the extract was calculated by peak areas in hplc . relative percentage of saponin is  %. the yield and purity suggests that the technique is practical and cost effective because the ultrasonic assisted acid-base alternative extraction does not need organic solvent and expensive equipment. ultrasonic can expedite dissolution in lower temperature, which protects activity of thermosensitive compounds in the extraction  <cit> .fig.  <dig> hplc chromatograph of the saponin extract

inhibitory effect of the saponin on bacteria in vitro and in vivo
inhibitory effect of the saponin on bacteria in vitro was measured by mic <dig> and ic <dig> of the camelliagenin on bacterial growth in culture medium. mic <dig> of the saponin on  <dig> strains of e. coli and  <dig> strains of s. aureus was separately  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml. the camelliagenin had significant inhibition on growth of both e. coli and s. aureus, but its effect on e. coli was stronger than s. aureus suggestive of its selectivity. amoxicillin and erythromycin had no obvious inhibitory effects on the two bacteria, indicating that the bacteria were resistant against the antibiotics. the camelliagenin plus antibiotics had better inhibition on bacteria than the camelliagenin or antibiotics alone, showing that the camelliagenin can strengthen bacterial sensitivity to antibiotics .table  <dig> inhibition concentration  of the saponin extract on 50 % bacterial growth and biofilm formation of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus

inhibition of the camelliagenin on bacteria in vivo was evaluated by its therapeutic effect on chicks induced by e. coli and s. aureus. chicks in negative groups showed serious symptoms of depression, anorexia, dullness, and diarrhea. amoxicillin and erythromycin did not relieve these symptoms obviously, suggesting bacterial resistance against the antibiotics. the camelliagenin and combined administration of the camelliagenin and antibiotics significantly  increased the body weight, immune organ index and reduced bacterial counts of liver in dose dependence, indicating that the camelliagenin enhances bacterial sensitivity to antibiotics and improves chicks immunity. the results are shown in fig.  <dig>  it further proves that the camelliagenin can not only substitute antibiotics, but also enhance antibiotic effects.fig.  <dig> the effects of the saponin on body weight increase , spleen index , thymus index  and bacterial count  in liver of chicks infected by escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. chicks in each group were injected intraperitoneally by  <dig>  ml  of e. coli or s. aureus suspension except normal group, 10 h later administered with feed containing erythromycin  or the saponin  respectively for consecutive  <dig> d. the chicks were weighed, monitored for  <dig> d. a, p <  <dig> , compared with negative group; b, p <  <dig> , compared with erythromycin group. nor: normal group; neg: negative group; lds: low dose of the saponin; mds: middle dose of the saponin; hds: high dose of the saponin; ery: erythromycin; ldse: low dose of the saponin + erythromycin; mdse: middle dose of the saponin + erythromycin; hdse: high dose of the saponin + erythromycin



in order to reduce the number of experimental animals and limitation of models, inhibitory tests were both carried out on bacteria in vitro and in vivo. the results show positive effects on inhibition of bacterial growth, indicating that the camelliagenin is promising as an effective antibacterial agent for e. coli and s. aureus. it may take effects on other kinds of bacteria, but needs further evaluation.

effects of the camelliagenin on biofilm formation and exudates
bacterial biofilm is a key factor to induce resistance against antibiotics and a target of new antimicrobials  <cit> . thus the biofilms of e. coli and s. aureus were analyzed in our research. the results showed that amoxicillin or erythromycin had no different effect on biofilms from negative group , and ic <dig> of the camelliagenin on biofilm of the two bacteria were lower than that of amoxicillin or erythromycin at significant level . it indicates that antibacterial effects of the camelliagenin are related to its inhibition on bacterial biofilm formation.

the expression of specific genes is involved in biofilm formation and responsible for bacterial drug resistance  <cit> . the main difference between biofilm bacteria and planktonic bacteria is that biofilm bacteria are tightly packed and wrapped in their own secreted extracellular polysaccharide matrix called extracellular polymeric substances . the main component of eps is alginate  <cit> . mannitol dehydrogenase is a key enzyme in alginate synthesis process of biofilm  <cit> . some antimicrobials can destroy biofilm formation since it inhibits activity of mannitol dehydrogenase in biosynthetic pathway of alginate  <cit> . in addition, large amount of extracellular dna  is found in the biofilm  <cit> , it not only affects the formation of biofilms, but also increases the resistance of biofilms by chelating cation  <cit> . it is proved that edna enzymes can clear immature biofilm in vitro  <cit> , and biofilm formation can be regulated by mannitol dehydrogenase and edna  <cit> .

mdh and edna in biofilm were measured respectively by a decrease in the absorbance of reactive mixture at 340 nm and biofilm lysate at 260 nm compared to untreated controls. ∆a <dig> and ∆a <dig> increased significantly  after the treatments of the camelliagenin at concentration dependence . it suggests that they play a role in the inhibition of mdh and edna in the biofilms.fig.  <dig> activity of mannitol dehydrogenase  and content of extracellular dna  in bacterial biofilm affected by the saponin and antibiotics . data were measured respectively by a decrease in the absorbance of reactive mixture at 340 nm and biofilm lysate at 260 nm compared to untreated controls. ∆ 340 nm reflects decrease of mannitol dehydrogenase activity, and ∆ 260 nm reflects decrease of edna in biofilm. a, p <  <dig> , compared with amoxicillin; b, p <  <dig> , compared with the saponin; c, p <  <dig> , compared with erythromycin. amo: amoxicillin; sap: saponin; ery: erythromycin



interaction of the camelliagenin with mannitol dehydrogenase and edna
molecular docking as a better method of molecular simulation is applied in this research. docking simulation shows that the saponin can interact with mannitol dehydrogenase  and edna. each molecule successfully docks in  <dig> poses. the average binding energy is separately − <dig>  ±  <dig>  kcal/mol and − <dig>  ±  <dig>  kcal/mol, the average interactive energy is respectively  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kcal/mol and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kcal/mol. it suggests that the camelliagenin can spontaneously bind to mdh and edna and exerts stronger interaction. mimic diagrams of the camelliagenin binding to mannitol dehydrogenase and dna are shown in fig.  <dig>  illustrating that they can well bind and interact with each other.fig.  <dig> interaction of the saponin with mannitol dehydrogenase  and extracellular dna 



based on the lock-key principle and complementary structural hypothesis, molecular docking simulates mutual interaction between ligand and receptor  <cit> . if receptor and ligand can interact, they must approach each other, and then combine in a particular conformation of the binding site, finally reach stable complex by adjusting conformation. correct affinity prediction is conducive to drug design and screening. the main factors affecting the binding stability of ligand and receptor are hydrophobic force and bonding force. free energy value is an important parameter for evaluation of docking affinity, binding activity and stability of receptor and ligand, and it can be used to judge the interaction of ligand and receptor. we simulated the interaction of the camelliagenin with mannitol dehydrogenase and edna, the result shows a good correlation between the interaction and its anti-biofilm effect. it suggests that molecular docking can be used to predict the saponin effect on biofilm inhibition.

saponins are detergent-like substances showing antibacterial potential, and the mechanism deserves discussion. the critical micelle concentration of the camelliagenin is  <dig>  %  <cit> , but its mic <dig> and ic <dig> are far away from the concentration whereas it shows detergent activity, demonstrating that its antibacterial activity is not due to the surface property. it is reported that the effect of saponin is associated with the changing of membrane permeability of gram-negative cells in contrast to gram-positive cells. saponin might interact with gram-negative cells components, like lipid a and thereby increase the permeability of bacterial cell wall  <cit> . because the camelliagenin can reduce mannitol dehydrogenase and edna in biofilm, we provide a new hypothesis that the camelliagenin interacts with key components in biofilm, and blocks their activities in biofilm formation. the interaction of the camelliagenin with mannitol dehydrogenase and edna contributes to its anti-biofilm activity.

CONCLUSIONS
the camelliagenin is isolated from the defatted seeds of c. oleifera by ultrasonic assisted acid–base alternative technique. this is cost effective for industrialization because no organic solvent and expensive equipment are applied in the process. it is identified as camelliagenin and has significant antibacterial activities on e. coli and s. aureus in vitro and in vivo. it suggests that the camelliagenin is hopeful candidate for prevention of antibiotic resistance. the effects of the camelliagenin include its inhibition on bacterial biofilm formation, which is related to mdh and edna in the biofilm. the camelliagenin can spontaneously bind to and interact with mdh and edna. that could be the mechanism of the camelliagenin action on the two bacteria.
