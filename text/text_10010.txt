BACKGROUND
chitin is a β- <dig> -linked homopolymer of n-acetylglucosamine , which is found mainly in the exoskeleton of crustaceans, insects and in the cell walls of fungi. chitin is one of the most abundant polymers in nature and its degradation derivatives are pharmaceutically valuable. for example, chitoligosaccharides can stimulate the immune system to respond to microbial infections and chitin monomers have been shown to act as anti-aging and anti-tumor agents, as well as to relieve the symptoms of osteoarthritis  <cit> . complete degradation of chitin requires chitinases  and β-n-acetylglucosaminidases  or chitobiases , so such enzymes could potentially serve as biocatalysts in the production of chitin derivatives of desired sizes during the recycling of chitin biomass.

as well as functioning in chitin degradation by bacteria, glcnacases are also known to be key enzymes in the catabolism of glycoconjugates containing n-acetylglucosamine residues  <cit>  and mutations of the gene encoding a human glcnacase homologue  cause a fatal genetic lipid storage disorder, known as tay-sachs disease  <cit> . in the cazy database , glcnacases are classified into glycosyl hydrolases family  <dig>  or family  <dig> , which differ in sequence and mode of enzyme action  <cit> . family- <dig> glcnacases are thought to act by a standard retaining mechanism involving a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate while family- <dig> enzymes employ a 'substrate-assisted' mechanism involving the transient formation of an oxazolinium ion intermediate  <cit> . most of the glcnacases described hitherto belong to the gh- <dig> family. to date, only five bacterial gh- <dig> glcnacases have been characterized, including nagz or exoii from vibrio furnissii  <cit> , nag3a from clostridium paraputrificum m- <dig>  <cit> , naga from streptomyces thermoviolaceus  <cit> , and naga and cbsa from thermotoga maritima and t. neapolitana  <cit> .

vibrio harveyi, formerly known as v. carchariae, is a gram-negative marine bacterium that causes luminous vibriosis, a serious disease that affects commercially farmed fish and shellfish species  <cit> . we previously reported isolation of the gene encoding endochitinase a from vibrio harveyi type strain  <dig> for functional and structural characterization  <cit> . in this study, we employed a homology-based strategy to isolate two glcnacase genes from the genome of the same vibrio strain. sequence analysis suggested that the resultant polypeptides were new members of the gh- <dig> family. enzymic properties of the glcnacases expressed in e. coli were investigated. their kinetic properties and identification of the subsites in the more active enzyme are discussed in further detail.

RESULTS
gene isolation and sequence analysis
the availability of the complete genome sequence allowed us to locate three open reading frames , including vibhar_ <dig> , vibhar_ <dig>  and, vibhar_ <dig>  in the genome of v. harveyi type strain atcc baa- <dig> bb <dig>  these reading frames encode uncharacterized proteins with presumed glcnacase activity. in an attempt to isolate the genes that encode glcnacases in a closely-related organism, three sets of oligonucleotides were designed based on the above-mentioned orfs. two homologous dnas were amplified by the oligonucleotides designed from the vibhar_ <dig> and vibhar_ <dig> orfs, whereas the dna fragment compatible with the vibhar_ <dig> orf could not be amplified successfully. hence, the first two dna fragments  were further cloned and expressed for functional characterization. nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the vhnag <dig> full-length dna contains  <dig>  bp which encode a polypeptide of  <dig>  da, whereas the vhnag <dig> full-length dna contains  <dig>  bp, encoding a polypeptide of  <dig>  da. the pi values of vhnag <dig> and vhnag <dig> were calculated to be  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the nucleotide and corresponding amino acid sequences of the newly-identified glcnacases have been deposited in the genbank/embl/ddbj database with assigned accession numbers of hm <dig> for vhnag <dig> and hm <dig> for vhnag <dig>  although a blast search indicated high sequence similarity of vhnag <dig> and vhnag <dig> to glcnacases from other vibrio species, most of these sequences turned out to be only hypothetical proteins with predicted glcnacase activity. low sequence similarity with all gh- <dig> members  suggested that neither of these enzymes belong to gh- <dig>  but matches of up to 30% with previously studied gh- <dig> enzymes indicated that they are new gh- <dig> members. a sequence comparison with eleven functionally-characterized gh- <dig> enzymes  shows that both vhnag sequences are closest to the α-chain of human glcnacase   <cit> , followed by serratia marcescens chitobiase   <cit> . fig.  <dig> shows a sequence alignment of vhnag <dig> and vhnag <dig> with three selected glcnacases, including vhchb  <cit>  , huhexa and smchb . since the structural details of smchb are well studied, further sequence comparisons were with smchb. as seen in fig.  <dig>  a number of consensus residues are identified, a few of which may participate in the catalytic function of the vibrio glcnacases. the most obvious of these are the acidic pairs asp287-glu <dig>  or asp437-glu <dig>   as they are completely aligned with asp539-glu <dig> of smchb. these two residues were previously shown to be crucial for the catalytic function of smchb, glu <dig> acting as the catalytic residue  <cit> . other residues found to be involved in binding the substrate in the enzyme-substrate complex of smchb-dinag include asp <dig>  arg <dig>  asp <dig>  asp <dig>  trp <dig>  trp <dig>  and trp <dig>  these residues are completely conserved among the glcnacase species .

recombinant expression and mass identification
the full-length vhnag <dig> and vhnag <dig> dnas were subsequently cloned into the pqe <dig> expression vector, which provides high-level expression in e. coli m <dig> of c-terminally 6-tagged polypeptides. the overall yields of the purified recombinant proteins obtained after ni-nta affinity chromatography were  <dig> -  <dig> mg/ml of bacterial culture. fig. 2a shows sds-page analysis, displaying a single band of vhnag <dig> migrating to slightly below the  <dig> kda marker and vhnag <dig> closer  <dig> kda. the molecular masses estimated from their mobilities are consistent with the theoretical masses of the enzymes . in peptide mass fingerprinting,  <dig> and  <dig> vhnag <dig> peptides unambiguously matched internal peptides of glcnacases from v. angustum and photobacterium sp, respectively. for vhnag <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> peptides were identical with the internal peptides of v. parahaemolyticus and v. alginolyticus glcnacases . this peptide mass identification strongly indicates that the proteins expressed in e. coli are glcnacases.

assessment of glcnacase activity and kinetic studies
both of the purified glcnacases were active against pnp-glcnac, but vhnag <dig> was found to be much more active than vhnag <dig>  we suspect that the full-length vhnag <dig> is expressed as a pro-enzyme, which requires proteolytic processing to attain its full activity. the hydrolysis of pnp-glcnac by vhnag <dig> and vhnag <dig> was determined as a function of time . vhnag <dig> activity was significantly greater than that of vhnag <dig> over the entire course of reaction. in the reaction progress curves, the activity of both enzymes was constant for up to  <dig> min, and then began to decrease at longer incubation times. therefore, the reaction time was set to  <dig> min to ensure that initial velocities were measured in subsequent kinetic experiments.

the effect of ph on glcnacase activity was examined with pnp-glcnac as substrate. the ph activity profiles of vhnag <dig> and vhnag <dig> were typical bell-shaped curves as seen for most glycosyl hydrolases. fig. 2b shows enzymic activity decreasing at low and high ph values. the maximal activity of vhnag <dig> was at ph  <dig>  and of vhnag <dig> at ph  <dig> . when specific hydrolytic activity was determined with various substrates , pnp-glcnac was found to be the most effective. while vhnag <dig> could hydrolyze all the three pnp-glycosides , vhnag <dig> was only active with pnp-glcnac. both enzymes could hydrolyze chitooligosaccharides  and colloidal chitin with vhnag <dig> being at least ten-times more active than vhnag <dig>  of the natural glycosides, chitotetraose was the best substrate and chitotriose the second best. in contrast, chitobiose, chitopentaose and chitohexaose were only fair substrates, and insoluble  chitin was the poorest of all .

the kinetic parameters of the hydrolytic activity of the two glcnacases were further assessed. as shown in table  <dig>  kcat/km with pnp-glcnac was 11-fold greater for vhnag <dig> than for vhnag <dig>  it was noted throughout this study that vhnag <dig> was tended to undergo rapid and progressive loss of glcnacase activity. although several attempts were made to obtain the kinetic values of this higher-mr enzyme, the data acquired with vhnag <dig> could not be evaluated precisely, and we decided not to present it in this study. in accordance with our earlier demonstration , vhnag <dig> had the lowest km and highest kcat, yielding overall kcat/km of  <dig>  m-1s- <dig> towards pnp-glcnac. when natural substrates were compared, vhnag <dig> had the greatest catalytic activity with glcnac <dig> , followed by glcnac <dig> , glcnac <dig> , glcnac <dig> , and glcnac <dig> . overall, kcat/km of vhnag <dig> with pnp-glcnac is 88-fold greater than with glcnac <dig>  and 16-fold greater than with glcnac <dig> . in general, the glycosidic bond of pnp-glcnac is more easily cleaved than that of glcnac-glcnac, because of the higher electron-withdrawing capacity of p-nitrophenyl moiety. however, the rate of hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl glycoside depends on the affinity to the enzyme used. for example, keyhani & roseman  <cit>  showed that vibrio furnssii β-glcnacidase  hydrolyzed pnp-glcnac about 5-fold faster than glcnac <dig>  but  <dig>  fold slower than glcnac3- <dig>  whereas kubota et al.  <cit>  reported that streptomyces thermoviolacacus nagc could hydrolyze pnp-glcnac and glcnac <dig> at equal rates. on the other hand, its activity with the pnp substrate was between 2- to  <dig> -fold greater than with glcnac3- <dig> 

a results are means ± sd .

the initial velocity of the reaction catalyzed by v. harveyi glcnacases was measured at 37°c,  <dig> min with varied concentrations of chitin oligosaccharides from 0- <dig> μm. the release of products was determined by the reducing sugar assay . the kinetic experiments were carried out in triplicate. the kinetic parameters  were estimated from a non-linear regression function available in graphpad prism v. <dig> .

time course of chitin oligosaccharide hydrolysis by tlc and hplc
degradation patterns of chitooligosaccharides by vhnag <dig> were analyzed by tlc . the most significant result obtained from tlc analysis is that vhnag <dig> acted exolytically, yielding glcnac as the end product from all chitin oligomers. additionally, glcnac <dig> and glcnac <dig> were degraded rapidly and almost completely within  <dig> min , whilst the reaction of glcnac <dig> was not complete until  <dig> h of incubation . the degradation of glcnac <dig>  and glcnac <dig>  was even slower, complete hydrolysis of these two substrates being attained only after  <dig> h of incubation.

the time course of chitin oligosaccharide hydrolysis by vhnag <dig> was further investigated by quantitative hplc. fig. 5a shows glcnac <dig> hydrolysis, showing a rapid increase of the resultant product  with increasing reaction time. fig. 5b and fig. 5c show glcnac <dig> and glcnac <dig> hydrolysis. in agreement with the tlc results, glcnac <dig> and glcnac <dig> were consumed more rapidly than glcnac <dig> , glcnac <dig>  and glcnac <dig> . at the end of recording , no substrate was left from the digestion of glcnac <dig> and glcnac <dig>  whereas substantial amounts of the other substrates remained. all substrates were hydrolyzed exolytically, so that glcnacn was degraded to glcnacn- <dig> + glcnac. the intermediate products, such as glcnacn- <dig> and glcnacn- <dig>  were further degraded to the final product glcnac. fig. 5f shows the overall rates of hydrolysis to be in the order: glcnac <dig> ≅ glcnac <dig> > glcnac <dig> > glcnac <dig> > glcnac <dig>  the substrate-size dependence of the reaction rate can be confirmed from the reaction time-course of extensive hydrolysis of glcnac <dig> over a longer period of incubation , the upper right panel of fig. 6); that is, chitin pentamer and dimer accumulated during the course of the reaction, whereas tetramer and trimer were generated only transiently before being hydrolyzed instantaneously by the enzyme. of the natural glycosides, glcnac <dig> was found to be the best substrate for vhnag <dig>  similar results were reported for β-glcnacidase  from vibrio furnssii  <cit> . this enzyme showed its highest vmax towards glcnac <dig>  while the vmax values decreased  <dig> -fold with glcnac <dig> and  <dig> -fold with glcnac <dig>  further sequence analysis suggested no putative signal peptide in the sequences of vhnag <dig> and vhnag <dig>  therefore, the two enzymes are suggested to be non-secretory proteins that act intracellularly. in bacterial cells, the transport of chitin oligomers into the intracellular compartments for further degradation by these glcnacases could be achieved by specific membrane transporters. it has been proposed for v. furnissii that the uptake of short-chain chitooligosaccharides, such as glcnac <dig> and glcnac <dig>  takes place through a chitooligosaccharide-specific channel known as chitoporin  <cit> .

kinetic modeling and subsite mapping
kinetic modeling of the enzymic reaction was carried out based on the reaction scheme presented in fig.  <dig>  to model the time-course of glcnac <dig> hydrolysis , numerical calculations were conducted using the differential equation derived from the reaction scheme  <cit> . at first, the binding free energy changes for the subsites from  to  were estimated roughly by repeating the calculations with various values of the free energy changes. starting with initial guessed values, optimization of the free energy changes conducted by the modified powell method  <cit>  was employed using the cost function,

  f=∑i∑n <dig> 

where e and c represent the experimental and calculated values, respectively, n is the number of glcnac units in the oligosaccharides, and i the reaction time.

the final iteration of the calculations yielded the values of the rate constants for glycosidic bond cleavage  for various chain lengths of glcnacn. the kcat values obtained were allocated to k+ <dig> for individual oligosaccharide substrates . the individual k+ <dig> values were fixed in the modeling calculation. since no evidence for transglycosylation was obtained from hplc determination of the enzymic products, this process was not considered in the kinetic model. a much higher value of  <dig> s- <dig> was tentatively allocated to the rate constant for hydration k+ <dig>  since vhnag <dig> splits off a monosaccharide from the non-reducing end of the substrate, indicating that subsite  should be the most unfavorable for binding of the glcnac residue, we tentatively allocated a high positive value  to the binding free energy change at subsite . using the fixed values of k+ <dig>  k+ <dig>  and the binding free energy change of subsite , the values of binding free energies of individual subsites from  to  were optimized on the basis of the experimental time-course . as shown in lower panels of fig.  <dig>  the calculated time-courses were satisfactorily fitted to the experimental ones, for both the early stage  and the later stage  of the reaction, yielding the binding free energy changes of the individual subsites as listed in table  <dig> 

the optimization was based on the experimental time-course of hexamer hydrolysis catalyzed vhnag <dig> .

the tlc and kinetic data suggested that the catalytic pocket of vhnag <dig> probably contains a sequence of four favorable glcnac binding subsites, designated . such an implication is certainly supported by the binding free energy changes obtained by the kinetic modeling. as shown in table  <dig>  a very high positive value + <dig>  kcal/mol for subsite  suggests that there is a large steric hindrance interfering with binding at this subsite. a less positive value of + <dig>  kcal/mol of subsite  suggests that the sugar residue binding to this subsite is moderately unfavorable, but still possible. thus, glcnac <dig> binds to  , , and  more strongly than glcnac <dig> to  , ,  and . a low negative free energy change, - <dig>  kcal/mol, was estimated for binding at subsite . this is consistent with the fact that the glcnac <dig> binding affinity to the subsites  , and   is somewhat weaker than that of the glcnac <dig> binding to  , , and  . all of these results clearly indicate that an array of four glcnac binding subsites  define the substrate affinity of vhnag <dig>  it appears that the glcnacases reported to date possess two major types of substrate specificity. the first type has marked preference towards chitobiose, while the other type favours chitooligomers  over chitodimer. examples of the former type are hyperthermophilic kodakaraensis kod <dig> glmatk  <cit> , smchb  <cit> , and s. thermoviolacacus nagc  <cit> . on the other hand, v. furnissii exoi  <cit> , human di-n-acetylchitobiase  <cit> , and vhnag <dig>  are among the other type. the active site of the second type of glcnacases has been demonstrated to contain three to five glcnac binding subsites, depending on the substrate specificity of individual enzymes. multiple sugar-binding-site architecture is not uncommon, as has been demonstrated for other exo-glycosidases such as aspergillus niger cellobiase  <cit> , a gh- <dig> enzyme that degrades cellobioase and cello-oligosaccharides into glucose units. the catalytic center of this enzyme has been reported to contain up to five binding subsites. also, structural studies of the active site of bacillus halodurans c- <dig> rex  <cit> , a gh- <dig> exo-oligoxylanase that hydrolyzes xylooligosaccharides to xylose from the reducing end, revealed three substrate binding subsites.

CONCLUSIONS
this study reports the isolation, cloning and recombinant expression of the genes encoding two intracellular gh- <dig> glcnacases from a marine bacterium, vibrio harveyi type strain  <dig>  data obtained from tlc and quantitative hplc suggested that the active glcnacase homolog  was an exolytic enzyme that degraded chitin oliogmers, releasing glcnac as the end product. kinetic modeling suggested that the active site of vhnag <dig> comprises four glcnac binding subsites, , , , . such subsite identification is strongly supported by kinetic data, which showed chitin tetramer as the most effective substrate for this enzyme.
