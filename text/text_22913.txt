BACKGROUND
psoriasis is a chronic disease affecting 1-2% of the adult population, with estimates rising as high as 8% in certain geographic regions  <cit> . psoriasis plaque formation is largely driven by cytokine-mediated interactions among dendritic cells, t-cells and keratinocytes , leading to altered differentiation and extensive kc proliferation  <cit> . to better understand this process, genome-wide expression profiling has been used to identify genes and pathways altered in psoriasis lesions as compared to normal skin  <cit> . over the years, the power of this approach has improved as studies have scaled up to include samples from more patients, increasing statistical power to generate more robust findings. two independent microarray studies, for instance, have now been performed using large cohorts with more than  <dig> patients each  <cit> . these data have allowed investigators to robustly identify differentially expressed genes and extract gene lists  <cit> . however, while individual genes with altered expression have been identified, underlying mechanisms remain unclear. further work is therefore needed to understand how expression patterns in psoriasis lesions are connected to the inflammatory and cytokine dynamics that drive plaque formation.

large-scale alteration of gene expression in psoriasis plaques is driven, in part, by differences in the composition and abundance of cell types present within lesional and non-lesional skin  <cit> . kc proliferation, for instance, is a hallmark of psoriasis lesions  <cit> , and consequently psoriasis-increased genes include those genes expressed at high levels in kcs  <cit> . likewise, psoriasis plaque formation is associated with an influx of non-resident immune cells, including t-cells, dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils  <cit> , leading to the formation of dermal/epidermal inflammatory cell aggregates  <cit> , and thus to increased expression of genes specifically expressed in lymphocytes and myeloid-derived cells. in psoriasis  <cit> , and other conditions  <cit> , these tissue remodeling processes have been investigated using statistical approaches applied to genome-wide expression patterns, which identify “signature genes” associated with individual cell types, and apply this information to identify shifts in cellular composition and to quantify the magnitude of these shifts. this approach, while informative, is not itself sufficient to understand the psoriasis transcriptome, however, since altered expression may also result from the activation or inhibition of cytokine-responsive pathways in resident cell types  <cit> . in cultured kcs, for example, stimulation with il-17a leads to induction of β-defensins and pro-inflammatory s <dig> proteins  <cit> , and such genes are consistently increased in psoriasis lesions  <cit> . in psoriasis, such cytokine-driven transcriptional responses of resident cells are superimposed upon shifts in cellular composition, adding a second layer of complexity to the transcriptome. here again, however, statistical approaches have proven effective, and prior work has identified “cytokine activity signatures” embedded within the psoriasis transcriptome, based upon comparison of genes altered in psoriasis lesions with those altered in kcs stimulated by specific cytokines in vitro <cit> .

a second important, but less well explored, aspect of the psoriasis transcriptome is the heterogeneity observed among lesions sampled from different patients  <cit> . previous studies have often focused on the expression of genes showing consistent differences between lesional and non-lesional skin, emphasizing analysis of differentially expressed genes   <cit> . while understanding mechanisms that drive differential expression remains important, the advent of larger datasets now permits new questions to be addressed  <cit> . one study, for instance, has identified two molecular sub-types of psoriasis based upon paired lesional  and non-lesional  samples from  <dig> patients, with one group  characterized by pp-elevated expression of hla-e, and the other group  by elevated expression of genes involved in adaptive immunity   <cit> . another study, with  <dig> patients, divided patients into three sub-groups based upon scores quantifying inflammatory infiltration by immune cell types , along with two sub-groups differing in the expression of genes activated by il- <dig> and other cytokines   <cit> . with larger datasets, the finer-scale characterization of these variations should improve our ability to discern molecular sub-types. ultimately, this may facilitate development of expression-based biomarkers that are biologically meaningful, but also useful for clinical applications   <cit> .

in this study, we analyzed genome-wide expression patterns in the involved  and uninvolved  skin from  <dig> psoriasis patients. our analysis combines microarray data from three separate studies, each of which profiled gene expression using the same oligonucleotide array platform  <cit> . using these data, we identify genes differentially expressed between pp and pn skin , and assess whether these genes are enriched for cytokine-responsive genes or genes specifically expressed in distinct cell populations. based upon these results, we associate most degs with a specific cell type and/or cytokine, and we have further identified mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by testing for association with transcription factor binding sites. finally, we mapped the lesion-to-lesion variation associated with distinct inflammatory and cytokine signatures, leading to the identification of molecular sub-types among the  <dig> lesions. extending these results, we show that such heterogeneous aspects may be associated with the response of patients to etanercept therapy.

RESULTS
80% of genes significantly elevated in psoriasis lesions can be explained by kc activity and infiltration by t-cells and macrophages
we assembled expression data from three studies in which raw data had been deposited in gene expression omnibus   <cit> . following quality control analyses, pooled data included paired lesional  and non-lesional  biopsies from  <dig> patients. for each patient, we calculated the difference  in expression for each probe set on the array. based upon these differences, we identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes  with significantly increased expression in psoriasis lesions .

we hypothesized that some pp-increased degs could be explained by kc activity and increased abundance of inflammatory cell types within lesions . to assess this possibility, we assembled a microarray database containing samples associated with a diverse range of  <dig> cell types . using this database, we identified genes showing a cell type-specific expression pattern*, with expression significantly higher in samples for one cell type, as compared to the other  <dig> cell types. as expected, degs most strongly increased in pp skin  showed a kc-specific expression pattern, with significantly higher expression in kcs as compared to other cell types . we next tested whether the  <dig> pp-increased degs overlapped significantly with genes specifically expressed in skin-associated cell types, including resident cells  and potentially infiltrating inflammatory cells . this identified six cell types for which cell type-specific genes were enriched among the  <dig> pp-increased degs, including kcs, γδ t-cells, macrophages, epidermis, cd34+ cells and nk cells . .

what fraction of pp-increased degs can be explained by the six cell types we identified? to address this question, we evaluated each deg individually, and assigned each deg to a cell type if the gene was specifically expressed in that cell type . if a deg could be assigned to more than one cell type, it was preferentially assigned to the single cell type for which cell type-specific genes were most strongly enriched among all pp-increased degs . overall, 90% of the degs could be assigned to the six cell types, with most  attributed to kcs , γδ t-cells  and macrophages  . degs assigned to kcs, for instance, included serpinb <dig>  s100a <dig>  tcn <dig> and krt <dig>  while those assigned to γδ t-cells included cd3g, cd3d, ifng and tnip <dig>  closer inspection revealed further trends among the pp-increased degs. in particular, degs most strongly elevated in pp skin  were enriched for genes highly expressed in kcs and epidermis . however, degs less strongly elevated in pp skin  were more highly expressed in inflammatory cells, such as γδ t-cells, macrophages and nk cells .

these trends were reinforced by analysis of lcm-dissected dermal inflammatory cells from pp skin and lcm-dissected dermis from pn skin   <cit> . we identified  <dig> genes elevated in lcm-dissected dermal inflammatory cells from pp skin . as expected, these genes were not significantly enriched for genes specifically expressed in kcs . however, there was significant enrichment for genes specifically expressed in the three inflammatory cell types identified above  . additionally, there was significant enrichment for other t-cell subsets, including cd3+ t-cells, cd4+ t-cells and cd8+ t-cells, regulatory t-cells and dendritic cells, suggesting that lcm may enhance the resolution for detection of expression shifts arising from the formation of immune cell aggregates in pp skin . using the same criteria stated above, we could assign a cell type to more than 90% of the  <dig> genes elevated in lcm-dissected dermal inflammatory cells from pp skin .

80% of genes decreased in psoriasis lesions are specifically expressed in subcutaneous adipose tissue, dermis and epidermis
our analysis of pp and pn samples from  <dig> patients identified  <dig> pp-decreased degs . among genes most strongly decreased in pp skin , most were weakly expressed in myeloid-derived cell types, but did show specific expression in epidermis . among all  <dig> pp-decreased degs, we identified significant enrichment for genes specifically expressed in eight cell types . most of these were skin-resident cell types and in fact pp-decreased degs were most enriched for genes expressed at high levels in subcutaneous adipose tissue, dermis and epidermis . to determine the proportion of pp-decreased degs that may be accounted for by these cell types, pp-decreased degs were inspected one-by-one, and each was assigned to one of the eight significant cell types . overall, 90% of pp-decreased degs could be assigned to at least one of the eight cell types , with 80% assigned to subcutaneous adipose tissue , epidermis  or dermis  . further inspection revealed that, although degs most strongly decreased in pp skin  tended to be expressed in epidermis , those degs with moderately decreased expression  were more commonly expressed at high levels in subcutaneous adipose tissue or dermis/fibroblasts .

epidermal genes elevated in psoriasis lesions overlap best with genes induced by il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> family cytokines in cultured kcs
of  <dig> pp-increased degs, we designated  <dig> as “epidermal”, based upon their high expression in kcs or epidermis as compared to  <dig> other cell types in our analysis . potentially, increased expression of these genes may be driven by the altered cytokine environment within psoriasis lesions  <cit> . we thus compiled data from  <dig> experiments in which genome-wide expression was evaluated in cultured monolayer kcs  following cytokine treatment . as expected, among the top  <dig> epidermal pp-increased degs, most were increased by at least one cytokine treatment, with several degs increased by multiple cytokines .

we screened the  <dig> experiments to determine which cytokine treatments induced a set of genes that overlapped best with the  <dig> epidermal pp-increased degs. in parallel, we evaluated how well genes induced in each experiment overlapped with  <dig> genes significantly elevated in lcm-isolated epidermis from psoriasis lesions as compared to lcm-isolated epidermis from normal skin   <cit> . we expected analysis of both gene sets to yield similar results, and indeed, there was good agreement, with significant and corresponding results obtained for  <dig> of the  <dig> experiments . overall, three groups of cytokines induced a gene set that overlapped best with the  <dig> epidermal pp-increased degs, including the il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> families . of the  <dig> top-ranked experiments, nearly all  involved experiments in which cells were treated with a cytokine from one of these groups. genes induced by il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> family cytokines in vitro thus bear the closest resemblance to epidermal degs elevated in pp skin.

among the  <dig> epidermal pp-increased degs,  <dig>  were not significantly altered in any of the  <dig> experiments for which induced/repressed genes overlapped significantly with the  <dig> degs . such non-responsive degs may be increased in pp skin due to alteration in the kc differentiation program, or otherwise, may be elevated due to expansion of the kc compartment. most degs , however, were significantly altered by cytokine treatment in at least one of the  <dig> significant experiments, and overall, we attributed the largest number of degs to induction by tnf + ifn-γ , il-1β  and il-17a  .

epidermal genes decreased in psoriasis lesions overlap best with genes repressed by il- <dig> family cytokines in cultured kcs
degs most strongly decreased in psoriasis  were enriched for genes with an epidermis-specific expression pattern , and overall, we classified  <dig> of the  <dig> pp-decreased degs as epidermal . for some of these, expression was repressed in vitro following cytokine treatment of kcs or reconstituted epidermis . we screened the  <dig> cytokine experiments  to determine which repressed a set of genes that overlapped best with the  <dig> epidermal pp-decreased genes. in parallel, we evaluated how well genes repressed in each experiment overlapped with  <dig> genes significantly decreased in lcm-isolated epidermis from pp skin as compared to lcm-isolated epidermis from pn skin   <cit> . we identified  <dig> experiments for which cytokine-repressed genes overlapped significantly with both sets of pp-decreased genes . for two of these, cells were treated with il-1β or il-17a , consistent with our findings for pp-increased genes . the strongest trends, however, were observed for cells treated with il- <dig> family cytokines, including all three cytokines from the il- <dig> family . these results show that epidermal genes decreased in pp skin are most similar in composition to genes repressed by il-10/il- <dig> family cytokines in vitro. overall,  <dig> of the  <dig> degs  were significantly repressed in at least one of the  <dig> significant experiments, and we attributed more than half of these  to repression by il- <dig> .

enrichment of ap- <dig> binding sites among psoriasis-increased genes and evidence for activation of an il-17a → ap- <dig> pathway
our analysis uncovered  <dig> epidermal pp-increased degs , which were also enriched for genes induced by il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> family cytokines . we hypothesized that some degs would be targeted by transcription factors  belonging to cytokine-responsive pathways. to address this possibility, we generated a motif dictionary with  <dig> binding sites for known tfs or dna-binding complexes, and we screened these sites to determine which were most enriched in  <dig> kb regions upstream of the  <dig> pp-increased degs .

we identified  <dig> sites enriched among the  <dig> degs, including  <dig> associated with ap- <dig> . to confirm this trend, we repeated the analysis starting with  <dig> genes elevated in lcm-dissected epidermis . based on this gene set, we did not identify sites significant at an fdr threshold of  <dig> . however,  <dig> of the  <dig> sites most enriched among the  <dig> genes were associated with the ap- <dig> complex  . further analysis revealed that genes encoding ap- <dig> components were differentially expressed in psoriasis lesions . among the  <dig> patients, there was significantly increased expression of junb, fosl <dig> and fosb in pp skin, along with significantly decreased expression of jund, fosl <dig> and fos . expression of junb, fosl <dig> and fosl <dig>  moreover, was significantly elevated in lcm-dissected epidermis from pp skin , while expression of junb and fosl <dig> was also elevated in lcm-dissected dermis from pp skin .

we next analyzed the  <dig> significant sites to determine if they were also enriched in  <dig> kb regions upstream of cytokine-induced genes . not surprisingly, an nf-κb site was enriched in regions upstream of the  <dig> epidermal pp-increased degs, as well as in regions upstream of genes induced by il-1- and il-20-family cytokines, il-17a, ifn-γ and tnf . interestingly, however, among the  <dig> ap- <dig> sites enriched in regions upstream of pp-increased genes, each was also enriched in regions upstream of genes induced by il-17a, and this result was replicated in 2- <dig> independent experiments . these results are consistent with activation of an il-17a → ap- <dig> pathway in pp skin.

psoriasis lesions from  <dig> patients can be divided into two sub-groups based upon inflammatory gene expression patterns 
gene expression patterns vary in direction and magnitude among lesions from different psoriasis patients, potentially reflecting distinct molecular-level sub-types  <cit> . for the  <dig> patients, we calculated signatures corresponding to inflammatory and skin-resident cell types, where the value of each signature is equal to the weighted average of fold-changes  among the  <dig> genes most specifically expressed in that cell type. consistent with our analysis of degs , lesions from nearly all patients  were associated with significantly large γδ t-cell and kc signatures . other inflammatory signatures were less consistent among patients . using cluster analysis, we identified  <dig> patients  with a strong inflammatory signature, characterized by heightened expression of genes specifically expressed in cd3+ t-cells, cd4+ t-cells, cd8+ t-cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, monocytes, neutrophils, nk cells and b cells . the remaining  <dig> patients  were associated with a weak inflammatory signature, with reduced expression of genes specifically expressed in these cell types .

psoriasis lesions from  <dig> patients can be divided into two sub-groups based upon the expression of cytokine-induced genes 
we next calculated signature scores based upon genes induced in each of  <dig> cytokine experiments , where the value of each score was equal to the weighted average of fold-changes estimated for the top  <dig> cytokine-induced genes . signature scores calculated for several cytokines, including il-1α and il-17a, were significantly elevated in nearly every patient . however, the magnitude of such effects varied, particularly with respect to ifn-γ, il-1α, il-17a, il- <dig>  il-36β, il-36γ and tnf . using cluster analysis, we identified  <dig> patients  with heightened scores for these cytokines, corresponding to elevated expression of cytokine-induced genes . the remaining  <dig> patients  were associated with weaker scores and lower expression of cytokine-induced genes . we refer to these groups as ifn-γ-strong and ifn-γ-weak, respectively, since the distinction between groups was especially strong with respect to the five ifn-γ signatures included in our analysis . notably, patients in the ifn-γ-weak group also tended to exhibit weak inflammatory patterns -- 63% those with ifn-γ-weak signatures were assigned to the weak inflammatory group .

lesions obtained at baseline from etanercept responders show increased expression of tnf-induced genes and genes specifically expressed in cd4+ t-cells
etanercept is an anti-tnf drug that can effectively resolve psoriasis, but not all patients show strong improvement while the condition of some may actually worsen  <cit> . since we observed differences among patients with respect to inflammatory and cytokine signatures , we evaluated whether similar metrics could distinguish between etanercept responders and non-responders. for this purpose, we used data from a previous microarray study of biopsies  from patients prior to etanercept treatment, including biopsies from  <dig> etanercept responders and  <dig> non-responders  <cit> . for each of  <dig> cell types, signatures were calculated based upon the top n genes most specifically expressed in that cell type, where the value of n was identified by searching for values that maximized separation between responders and non-responders . likewise, for each of  <dig> cytokine experiments, signatures were calculated based upon the top n cytokine-induced or cytokine-repressed genes, where the value of n was chosen using the same search criteria .

etanercept responders had significantly higher inflammatory signatures, including those calculated for cd3+ t-cells, cd4+ t-cells and b cells . pp skin from responders also had significantly higher expression of genes induced by il-17c, il-26d, il-36b, tgf-α and tnf, with lower expression of genes induced by il- <dig> + il- <dig> . in addition, the expression of genes repressed by il-1α, il- <dig>  il-36a, ifn-γ and il- <dig> + il- <dig> was higher in responders, while the expression of genes repressed by il-17a and il-17c was lower . combination of multiple signatures improved differentiation between responders and non-responders. to illustrate, we mapped patients onto the bivariate space formed by tnf-induced and cd4+ t-cell signatures . among  <dig> patients, signature scores ranged in value, with some individuals showing no elevation of tnf-induced genes or genes specifically expressed by cd4+ t-cells . only a subset of this variation was observed among the  <dig> etanercept responders and  <dig> non-responders . however, when mapped onto the bivariate signature space , there was no overlap between responders and non-responders, with clear separation between the centroids calculated for these two groups . we could therefore define two distinct regions that completely distinguished the  <dig> non-responders from the  <dig> responders .

discussion
psoriasis lesions arise from complex interactions among infiltrating and resident immune cells, local skin cells, and a network of cytokines, which together create a pro-inflammatory microenvironment that promotes kc proliferation. this working model of psoriasis pathogenesis is consistent with prior microarray studies, all of which have shown increased expression of inflammatory and cytokine-related genes in lesional skin  <cit> . while many differentially expressed genes  have been identified within psoriasis lesions, however, underlying mechanisms remain unclear in most cases. in this study, therefore, we robustly identified degs based upon a large sample  and performed targeted analyses to better understand why each deg is differentially expressed. our findings show that psoriasis degs can be explained in part by shifts in the cellular composition of psoriasis lesions , and in part by the response of kcs to cytokines, particularly those from the il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> families. at the same time, among all patients, we uncovered fine-scale differences in the magnitude of inflammatory cell infiltration  and cytokine activity . while we could assign mechanisms to explain many psoriasis degs, therefore, the relative influence of such mechanisms on gene expression may also vary among lesions. we propose that such inter-patient differences can provide the basis for development of expression-based biomarkers, which might prove useful for predicting individual response to biologic therapies.

psoriasis lesions and normal human skin consist of a complex mixture of cell types, but key features of lesional skin are an increased presence of inflammatory cells, along with expansion and activation of the resident kc population  <cit> . for such contexts, we and other investigators have analyzed expression data with the aim of dissecting out the contribution of distinct cell types to observed differences in gene expression between two treatments   <cit> . in the present study, our findings indicate that pp-increased degs are driven largely by kc activity, including expansion of the kc population in pp skin and the response of kcs to an altered cytokine environment. a fraction of pp-increased degs, moreover, could be explained by an influx of inflammatory cells  . interestingly, properties of pp-decreased degs contrasted with those of the increased degs, since decreased degs were commonly expressed by resident cells, including subcutaneous adipose tissue and dermis . we propose that four factors may contribute to this trend.  first, in rna isolates from pp skin, increased proportional contribution of epidermis-derived rna would necessarily decrease the proportional contribution of other skin cell types.  second, in one study , pn samples were obtained from the buttock/upper thigh region, which tends to have greater subcutaneous adipose tissue and dermal thickness compared to regions where pp samples may often be obtained   <cit> .  third, genes associated with lipid metabolism may be down-regulated in epidermal cells from pp skin  <cit> , and this effect may underlie altered phospholipid abundance in pp skin  <cit> .  fourth, repressed gene expression may be more easily observed in non-kc skin cells, since abundance of such cell types and their gene products are not, in contrast to kcs, markedly elevated in pp skin. each of these factors  –  would favor decreased expression of adipose- and/or dermis-expressed genes in pp skin . to discriminate among these possibilities, further studies are needed, and along these lines we expect that mrna profiling of specific cell populations will be most informative   <cit> .

psoriasis is understood to be a t-cell-mediated disease and treatments that block interactions between t-cells and antigen presenting cells have demonstrated clinical efficacy  <cit> . we found that genes specifically expressed in γδ t-cells were better represented among psoriasis-increased degs than those genes specifically expressed in other t-cell subsets. this was the case not only in our analysis of bulk skin biopsies , but also of lcm-dissected inflammatory cells from lesional dermis . this result was obtained largely because genes specifically expressed in γδ t-cells were more consistently elevated in psoriasis lesions . we detected significant γδ t-cell signatures in 95% of psoriasis patients, including those from the weak and strong inflammatory groups . in contrast, significant signatures for other t-cell subsets  were detected in only  <dig> – 54% of patients, and most of these patients were from the strong inflammatory group . as a result, genes specifically expressed in other t-cells subsets  were not enriched among degs, which included only those genes with consistent trends among the  <dig> patients . in agreement with these findings, previous ihc studies have confirmed increased abundance of γδ t-cells in lesions from psoriasis patients  <cit> . in human skin, absolute numbers of γδ t-cells are modest relative to αβ t-cells  <cit> , although this may differ in mouse skin, in which γδ t-cells are estimated to constitute 90% of epidermal t-cells   <cit> . nevertheless, the potential importance of γδ t-cells to psoriasis pathophysiology has been supported by reports demonstrating il-17a production by γδ t-cells within lesions  <cit> , by the association between reduced abundance of γδ t-cells in the blood and severity of psoriasis  <cit> , and by the restoration of γδ t-cell numbers in the blood following successful treatment of psoriasis with systemic therapies  <cit> .

cytokines mediate the inflammatory reactions that sustain kc proliferation, and tnf, il-12/ <dig>  and il-17a have each been effectively targeted by biologic therapies  <cit> . we compared epidermal pp-increased degs to genes induced or repressed by cytokines across a panel of  <dig> in vitro experiments, where each experiment involved treatment of kcs or reconstituted epidermis with a cytokine or cytokine combination. this allowed us to perform an unbiased screen to assess which in vitro cytokine expression responses overlapped best with epidermal degs, providing indication of which cytokine treatments generate the most “psoriasis-like” expression profile in kcs  <cit> . in some respects, the strongest evidence from our study supports the il- <dig> family cytokines as drivers of differential gene expression in psoriasis . genes induced by il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> overlapped significantly with epidermal genes elevated in pp skin , while conversely, genes repressed by il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> overlapped significantly with epidermal genes decreased in pp skin . the transcriptional effects of il- <dig> family cytokines, therefore, were associated with both increased and decreased expression in psoriasis lesions. corresponding trends were observed for each of the three cytokines , consistent with the observation that each cytokine signals through the same il-20r1/il-20r <dig> receptor complex  <cit> . although the importance of il- <dig> family cytokines in plaque formation is not completely understood, mrna and protein levels of il <dig>  il <dig> and il <dig> are significantly elevated in psoriatic epidermis  <cit> . data from mice suggests that this elevation can augment epidermal hyperplasia, since overexpression of either il- <dig> or il- <dig>  elicits a psoriasis-like phenotype  <cit> .

ultimately, events that drive psoriasis plaque formation depend upon activation of a cytokine network, which features interactions among cytokines from multiple families  <cit> . along these lines, our findings also support il-17a and il- <dig>  as drivers of increased and decreased degs in psoriatic epidermis . il-17a signatures from disparate studies were repeatedly associated with psoriasis degs, particularly the pp-increased degs . additionally, of the  <dig> cytokine treatments screened, genes induced by il-1α were most strongly enriched among the increased degs, while genes repressed by il-1α were most strongly enriched among decreased degs . this overlap between il-1-responsive genes and psoriasis degs is consistent with prior work and may reflect the contribution of innate immune responses to the psoriasis transcriptome  <cit> . whereas the importance of il-17a to pathogenesis has now been convincingly demonstrated by successful treatment of patients with il-17a antibodies  <cit> , treatments targeting il- <dig> receptor have shown efficacy only for pustular psoriasis, but not plaque psoriasis  <cit> . nevertheless, il-1α potently induces the expression of il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> in kcs  <cit> , drives differentiation of th <dig> cells  <cit> , and is required for generation of il-17a by γδ t-cells in mouse skin  <cit> . these effects of il-1β connect together several of the cytokines  that were best supported in our study. we therefore speculate that, while the role of il-1β in psoriasis remains unclear, its activity may nonetheless reinforce activation of the cytokine network within psoriasis lesions.

cytokines initiate signaling cascades by binding to kc receptors, ultimately leading to the activation or repression of transcription factors  that coordinate gene expression responses. we screened a dictionary of  <dig> tf binding sites to determine which were most strongly enriched in regions  <dig> kb upstream of genes with significantly altered expression in psoriasis lesions. among epidermal pp-increased degs, we identified nine ap- <dig> binding sites significantly enriched in  <dig> kb upstream regions . additionally, in bulk skin biopsies and in lcm-dissected epidermis, expression of genes encoding ap- <dig> components was significantly altered   <cit> . these same ap- <dig> sites, moreover, were similarly enriched in upstream regions of genes induced by il-17a in kc cultures . these results implicate ap- <dig> as a possible mediator of cytokine-stimulated gene expression in psoriasis lesions, and highlight il-17a as one potential coordinator of ap- <dig> activity. in psoriasis lesions, the significance of ap- <dig> is not yet clear, although ap- <dig> dna binding as measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay is substantially reduced  <cit> . this attenuation of ap- <dig> activity could contribute to abnormal kc differentiation, since ap- <dig> family member genes are differentially expressed in epidermal layers and at different stages of differentiation  <cit> , while expression of a dominant negative form of c-jun inhibits ap- <dig> binding in kcs and blocks kc differentiation  <cit> . furthermore, in mice, double knockout of junb and c-jun leads to a skin phenotype with altered kc differentiation, which was suggested to mimic some features of human psoriasis  <cit> . these findings, in combination with our own results, point to ap- <dig> as a downstream effector of il-17a , and support a role for ap- <dig> in the abnormal kc differentiation characteristically seen in psoriasis lesions.

psoriasis lesions have characteristic histological features and appear macroscopically similar, but gene expression analyses have also identified sub-groupings among lesions from different individuals  <cit> . consistent with this, our findings highlight differences in the activation status of inflammatory and cytokine networks in lesions from different patients . to some degree, we expect that such differences will be associated with early or late stages of plaque development, differences in anatomical location , or the specific region of a plaque that is sampled   <cit> . on the other hand, the developmental context for each psoriasis lesion is patient-specific and likely shaped by an integration of genetic  and environmental signals . consistent with this idea, we found that inflammatory and cytokine signatures, calculated from baseline biopsies prior to treatment, could differentiate between etanercept responders  and non-responders  . etanercept responders, for instance, showed elevated expression of tnf-induced genes as well as genes specifically expressed in cd4+ t-cells . this suggests that variation in gene expression signatures at least partly reflects clinically relevant differences between individuals, potentially due to association with genetic factors that partially determine responses to anti-tnf therapy  <cit> . in future work, therefore, we expect that expression-based signatures, representing inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine activity, can be integrated with genetic information to create multivariate models that effectively forecast treatment outcomes on an individual basis. this should improve our understanding of factors that underlie treatment responses while also providing a tool that will inform the clinical decision of which type of antipsoriatic therapy should be administered.

CONCLUSIONS
psoriasis lesions are characterized by large-scale shifts in gene expression, but mechanisms underlying these trends are not completely understood. in this study, we analyzed expression patterns in lesions from a large cohort  to identify mechanisms driving differentially expressed genes . we assigned a candidate cell type for 90% of increased and decreased degs, and showed that most increased degs can be explained by kc activity and inflammatory cell infiltration . moreover, degs expressed highly in epidermis were associated with ap- <dig> binding sites and were heavily enriched for cytokine-induced genes . we identified sub-groups among the  <dig> patients based upon signature scores reflecting inflammatory cell infiltration  and cytokine activity . using these signature scores, it was possible to differentiate between etanercept responders  and non-responders . overall, this work advances an analytic framework that can be applied to interpret gene expression in psoriasis or any other inflammatory skin disease. these findings also illustrate the range of gene expression patterns associated with chronic plaque psoriasis, and provide justification for further work exploring the use of expression-based signatures for prediction of treatment outcomes with anti-tnf therapy.
