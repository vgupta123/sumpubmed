BACKGROUND
in recent years, the number of patients suffering from allergic asthma has increased  <cit> , and allergic diseases including asthma have become a social problem affecting medical costs and quality of life. allergic asthma is a complex disorder characterized by airway inflammation, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and reversible airway obstruction. elevated numbers of activated th <dig> cells, mast cells and eosinophils in the bronchial mucosa cause certain features of asthma, including increased serum ige levels in allergic asthma. the available data suggest that there are many potential susceptible genes for allergic asthma, including genes for cytokines, receptors, transcription factors, immune recognition and regulation of lipid mediator generation. a few susceptible genes for allergic asthma have been identified that may be associated with the asthmatic phenotype  <cit> , but definite susceptible genes have not been identified yet. thus, large-scale analysis of gene markers is needed, along with identification of association between these genetic polymorphisms and the asthmatic phenotype, and its development mechanism. it has been reported that the human genome has  <dig> to  <dig> million single nucleotide polymorphisms . a snp in a coding region can cause amino acid substitution, resulting in functional modification of the protein; a snp in a promoter region can affect transcriptional regulation; and a snp in an intron region can affect splicing and expression of the gene. thus, snps can be highly informative for identifying genetic factors of multifactorial disease such as allergic asthma.

in the present study, we analyzed associations between snps and childhood allergic asthma , which is more strongly influenced by genetic factors than other types of allergic asthma. we performed this analysis using an artificial neural network , which is a computer-based algorithm that can be trained to recognize and categorize complex patterns  <cit> . anns have been used for discrimination between subtly different clinical disease lesions; e.g., premalignant lesion barrett's versus esophageal cancer, based on microarray data  <cit> . in a previous study, we performed severity assessment of senile dementia of alzheimer type using ann modeling of electroencephalogram data. the average error of the ann model for assessment scale  score was  <dig>  points out of  <dig>  <cit> . we have also used an ann for prediction of  <dig> allergic diseases using snp data  <cit> ;  <dig> subjects with data for  <dig> snps were analyzed, and the ann model predicted diagnosis with accuracy of more than 78%. thus, we have achieved sufficiently high accuracy with anns using relatively little snp data.

here, we propose an ann model  suitable to diagnostic prediction of  <dig> subjects with caa and  <dig> healthy subjects, using  <dig> snps in  <dig> genes shown in table  <dig>  for comparison with ann, we also used logistic regression  analysis, which is currently used to analyze medical statistics and equivalent to ann with a single hidden node  <cit> . in order to selectively identify susceptible snps, a susceptible marker-selectable ann is proposed, in which a parameter decreasing method  is incorporated. information on obtaining the execute code, example data and documentation of this software is available at . associations between combinations of important snps and caa pathogenesis were investigated. a χ <dig> test was performed for all 2-snp and 3-snp combinations.

RESULTS
snps selected for diagnostic prediction with ann
several reports have suggested linkage between asthma and chromosomes. for example, genes in the 5q31-5q <dig> region code for th2-type cytokines   <cit>  and adrb <dig>   <cit> . il- <dig> operates via the il- <dig> receptor , which is encoded by a gene in chromosomal region 16q <dig>  mice deficient in the il-4rα chain lack ige production and th <dig> inflammatory reactions, and it has been shown that total ige level is dependent on ile50val substitution  <cit> . in the present study, we analyzed  <dig> snps  in  <dig> genes known to be associated with development of asthma. association between these snps and caa was assessed by p-value. as shown in table  <dig>   <dig> of these  <dig> snps had a p-value greater than  <dig> . the p-values of cyslt <dig> , il-4rα , adrb <dig>  and c <dig>  were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. when cyslt <dig> , which had the lowest p-value of  <dig> snps, was used for discrimination between case and control as a sole factor, prediction accuracy was  <dig> %, and the sensitivity and specificity was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, compared with the number of case and control subjects to assess discrimination performance . thus, we constructed a susceptible marker-selectable ann model, which can discriminate between cases and controls using the selected susceptible snps, and which can include the association between combinations of snps and development of caa.

diagnostic prediction using  <dig> snps
we used a three-layered ann with input, hidden and output layers . an ann model and lr model, with  <dig> snps as input variables, were constructed with learning data, and we performed diagnostic prediction with evaluation data. the results of diagnostic prediction are shown in figure 2a,2b and table 2a. the ann had higher prediction accuracy than lr. accordingly, sensitivity and specificity, with both evaluation data and learning data, were higher for the ann than for lr . in lr analysis, monte carlo study was performed to evaluate the effect of number of events per variable   <cit> . it suggested that at least  <dig> events per variable analyzed were desirable to maintain the validity of the model. in the present study, we used  <dig> events per group and  <dig> variables . lr would not have an enough power for parameter selection, because  <dig> events per group is small compared with that of variable. the construction of optimized lr model should be furthermore investigated.

selection of susceptible snps for caa
ritchie et al.  <cit>  reported the optimization of the architecture using genetic programming neural networks   <cit> . if important snps were previously determined, optimization of network architecture should be carried out. genetic programming neural networks have contributed the construction of ann model with high performance. in the present study, however, many candidate snps were used and the selection of snps is firstly desired. therefore, in order to extract snps closely associated with caa, we tried optimization of input variables by pdm in the ann model, while the architecture of a neural network was not modified. five pdm trials were performed. figure  <dig> shows typical results for change of accuracy during pdm procedure. when input variables were excluded one by one to preserve prediction accuracy , the accuracy began to decrease after the number of snps used for modeling reached  <dig>  when the number of snps used for modeling decreased, coincidence of genotyping pattern between cases and controls inevitably occurred. when genotyping pattern of a case was coincident with that of controls, the learning for model construction did not progress well. we investigated the rate of case subjects whose genotype patterns were coincident with that of control subjects at each step of pdm . rate of case subjects  in figure  <dig> means n'case/ncase. in this case, n'case is the number of cases whose genotype pattern is match to control's genotype pattern at least one control . as shown in figure  <dig>  there was little coincidence of genotype patterns when more than approximately  <dig> snps were used in ann modeling. therefore, the decrease in accuracy was considered to be due to omission of a highly important snp. the remaining  <dig> snps were worth investigating as important factors.

to investigate the important snps, we counted the number of snps that remained within the last  <dig> input variables in  <dig> trials. the significance order of remaining snps was listed, and a score of order ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> points was determined, based on the significance order. the remaining snps were reordered according to sums of scores, as shown in table  <dig>  we believe that snps with higher scores are more important for development of caa, because significance of snps correlated with the order of elimination via the pdm procedure described in methods section. ann models were reconstructed using snps listed in table  <dig>  the number of input snps varied from three , cyslt <dig>  and il- <dig> ) to  <dig> snps  according to the order of table  <dig>  when more than  <dig> snps were used as input variables, average accuracy for learning and evaluation data was high , and was almost equal to that of the model using  <dig> snps. these results suggest that the  <dig> snps selected in table  <dig> are very important for prediction of development of caa.

the results of diagnostic prediction using the  <dig> snps selected by pdm are shown in figure 2c, and the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are shown in table 2b. in the ann model, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity with evaluation data were again sufficiently high, and were somewhat similar to the results from the analysis using  <dig> snps, although the number of input variables was markedly smaller than in the analysis using  <dig> snps. in particular, sensitivity was significantly high , indicating that case subjects were more correctly diagnosed by this model. to compare with the lr model, lr model consisting of  <dig> snps selected by ann was constructed . as shown in table 2b, the lr model constructed showed low accuracy. this result indicates high performance of ann modeling for caa prediction although selected snps would not be suitable for lr analysis. we concluded that the ann model constructed with  <dig> snps could discriminate between cases and controls as precisely as the model constructed with  <dig> snps.

interaction between snp and another snp for caa
to understand the importance of the  <dig> snps selected, we analyzed combinations of these  <dig> snps. we paid particular attention to snp combinations associated with caa, and assessed whether any combinations consisting of snps selected by ann were associated with caa. the relationships between 2-snp or 3-snp combinations and caa development were examined by calculating p-value using the χ <dig> test. in models using  <dig> snps selected by pdm or the other  <dig> snps, the total number of 2-snp combinations and 3-snp combinations  is  <dig>  or  <dig> , and  <dig>  or  <dig> , respectively. with respect to 2-snp combination between the snp of interest and snp a, p-value was calculated as follows. when patients were limited with certain pattern of another snp, such as aa major homozygote of snp a, patient distribution of the snp of interest was investigated. with respect to 3-snp combination, between the snp of interest, and snp a and b, p-value was calculated as follows. when patients were limited with certain pattern of two other snps, such as aa major homozygote of snp a and bb major homozygote of snp b, patient distribution of the snp of interest was investigated.

to evaluate p-value of the combination, the usual bonferroni correction of p-values was first investigated. to select the 2-snp combination accompanied with minimum false positive, the criterion was p <  <dig> / <dig>  here  <dig> cases correspond to 25c <dig>  under this severe condition, there were no significant snps. as the same as 2-snp combination, any significant combination was not obtained on 3-snp combination under the threshold of p <  <dig> / <dig>  next, to determine important combination, p-value without bonferroni correction was used, that is p <  <dig> . results are shown in table  <dig>  in 2-snp combination, there were  <dig> combinations with p <  <dig>  among total  <dig> combinations. in the case of 3-snp,  <dig> combinations with p <  <dig>  were existed in  <dig> exhaustive combinations. however, combinations possibly include several false positive significant combinations. therefore, we paid attention to the snp, of which p-value effectively decreases by combining with genotype or allele of other snps. we defined effective combination value . ecv <dig> or ecv <dig> is the ratio of  <dig> or 3-snps p-value to the product of each p-value. ecv is not indicator for avoiding false positives but for evaluation of interaction. for example, in  <dig> snp combinations, when patients were limited with certain pattern of another snp, such as aa major homozygote of snp a, patient distribution of the snp x of interest is investigated . if the 2-snp combination is independent  each other, pax equals multiplication of pa and px. ecv< <dig> means that the 2-snp combination is not independent and two snps have any interaction each other.

the effect of ecv on number of effective combinations is shown in table  <dig>  about half number of 2-snp combination satisfied the condition ecv2< <dig> . among  <dig> combinations with p <  <dig>  mentioned above,  <dig> combination also satisfied the same condition . when ecv2< <dig> , necv2< <dig>  decreased the number to  <dig> and  <dig> of necv2< <dig> p =  <dig> still remained. when ecv2< <dig> , necv2< <dig>  became small and it was thought that positive combination may be lost. in the case of 3-snp combination, only 20% of the total combination satisfied the condition p <  <dig> . the combinations of 12% among the total combinations  satisfied ecv3< <dig>  all of these  <dig> combinations also satisfied the condition p <  <dig> . from these results, it was concluded that p <  <dig>  is not strict criterion for 3-snp combination analysis. in the case of 2-snp combination, ecv2< <dig>  was adequate as a selection of effective combination, because 77% of the combination with p <  <dig>  still remained. from these consideration, we selected these two evaluation bases  in order to determine effective combinations and the combination with necv< <dig> ,p  was picked up. the combinations were used for the following investigation. the number of combination which satisfies the condition, p <  <dig>  and ecv2< <dig>  in 2-snp combination and p <  <dig>  and ecv3< <dig>  in 3-snp combination was designated as nef, the number of effective combination, respectively .

it is very important to clearly determine whether effective combinations frequently occur among groups of  <dig> snps selected by ann modeling with pdm. it would be difficult to investigate the phenotypes associated with each of such a large number of combinations. identifying effective 2-snp combinations using the conditions described above is a useful method of identifying 2-snp combinations that merit further investigation. ten effective combinations were found among the  <dig> snps selected by ann;  <dig> effective combinations were found between those  <dig> snps and the remaining  <dig> snps; and  <dig> effective combinations were found among the remaining  <dig> snps. it is likely that the former  <dig> combinations are more important than the latter  <dig> combinations, because the ann model constructed using only the selected  <dig> snps exhibited sufficiently high accuracy to predict development of caa. susceptible genes for development of a multifactorial disease like caa can correctly classify many subjects as cases or controls, and it is very important that those genes involve snp combinations that have important interaction with high concentration ratio. we defined the concentration ratio as the ratio of effective rate to random selection rate. when the effective rate, nef/Σnef, was calculated, it was found to be  <dig>   for the  <dig> snps selected by pdm,  <dig>   for combinations between the  <dig> selected snps and the remaining  <dig> snps, and  <dig>   for combinations of the remaining  <dig> snps . the random selection rate, ncom/15p <dig> shown in table  <dig>  represents the rate which the combination is selected from all 2-snp combinations independently,  <dig>   for the  <dig> snps selected by pdm,  <dig>   for combinations between the  <dig> selected snps and the remaining  <dig> snps, and  <dig>   for combinations of the remaining  <dig> snps . the concentration ratio was found to be  <dig>  for the  <dig> snps selected by pdm,  <dig>  for combinations between the  <dig> selected snps and the remaining  <dig> snps, and  <dig>  for combinations of the remaining  <dig> snps . the concentration ratio was higher for combinations among the  <dig> selected snps than for other combinations, so we can select 2-snp combinations associated with caa with high rate. the results are shown in table  <dig> 

in the next step, 3-snp combinations were analyzed. the effective rate, the random selection rate, and the concentration ratio were calculated as well as the case of 2-snp combination . it was found to be  <dig>  for each of the  <dig> selected snps alone ,  <dig>  for  <dig> of the  <dig> selected snps and  <dig> of the remaining  <dig> snps ,  <dig>  for  <dig> of the  <dig> selected snps and  <dig> of the remaining  <dig> snps , and  <dig>  for the remaining  <dig> snps alone . the concentration ratio was higher for combinations among the  <dig> selected snps than for other combinations, so we can select 3-snp combinations associated with caa with high rate. the combination with the lowest ecv <dig> consisted of the genes il-4rα, and c <dig> . this is about 3% of the value multiplied each p-value of 2-snp combination . for patients with genotype ga of il-4rα  and genotype ct of c <dig> , patient frequency against genotype of c <dig>  had a p-value of  <dig> . for c <dig>  alone, a p-value of  <dig>  was obtained, which was  <dig> times greater than the p-value of the 3-snp combination. thus the rate of correct identification of effective combinations evaluated by adjusted p-value and ecv selected based on pdm trials was higher than the corresponding randomized rate, implying that the ann can reliably select snp combinations that are associated with caa.

the 2-snp combinations with the conditions described above among selected  <dig> snps are shown in table  <dig>  for example, in table  <dig>  for combinations between cyslt <dig>  and il-4rα , among subjects with a cyslt <dig>  genotype of ag or gg , there was an important correlation with il-4rα  genotype of gg, ga, aa . we examined the distributions of important combinations among subjects. a total of  <dig> caa subjects and  <dig> healthy controls had genotype ag or gg at cyslt <dig> and genotype gg at il-4rα  .

the present findings also indicate that the 3-snp combination consisting of il- <dig> , il- <dig>  and c <dig>  is a susceptible factor of caa . no association with caa was found for any of these  <dig> snps alone  or for any 2-snp combinations of them . subjects with genotype ca at il- <dig> , genotype ct at il- <dig>   and genotype gg at c <dig>   were estimated to be at high risk for pathogenesis of caa. furthermore, among the subjects with the same genotype pattern, the number of subjects with genotype aa at c <dig>  were caa,  <dig> and healthy controls,  <dig>  respectively .

other remarkable combinations shown in table  <dig> were also found among the  <dig> selected snps. for example, the number of cases with gg genotype at il-4rα  and tt genotype at c <dig>  was  <dig> times the number of controls with that genotype combination  . there are no previous reports of association between these genotype combinations and caa. the combination of il-4rα  and il- <dig>  was also associated with caa ; association between allergic asthma and this combination has previously been reported  <cit> .

discussion
to characterize the development mechanism, we investigated several relationships between snps and development of caa, referring to previous papers, as described below. il- <dig> is produced by th <dig> cells, and exerts its activity by interacting with the receptor il-4rα, located on the surface of b cells. it has been reported that the v <dig> /r <dig> combination of il-4rα polymorphisms may be associated with enhancement of il-4rα function  <cit> . as concerns the polymorphisms on il- <dig>  it was reported that the -590t allele increases the strength of the il- <dig> promoter compared with the -590c allele  <cit> . c <dig> is a proinflammatory mediator that binds to specific cell surface receptors and causes leukocyte activation, smooth muscle contraction and vascular permeability  <cit> . c3-deficient mice challenged with allergen show diminished airway hyperresponsiveness and lung eosinophilia, with dramatic reduction of the number of il-4-producing cells and attenuation of ige responses  <cit> . in the present study, we found that interaction between genotype tt at c <dig>  and genotype gg at il-4rα  may be associated with caa, but details of interaction between these polymorphisms combinations and development mechanisms have not been clarified. the present findings indicate that, among subjects with an il- <dig>  genotype of ca and an il- <dig>  genotype of ct, there is important correlation with a c <dig>  genotype of gg or aa .

cyslts, which are produced by inflammatory cells including eosinophils, are mediators of leukotrienes, and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases. recently, it has been reported that cyslts can act as autocrine or paracrine mediators to stimulate rapid, nonexocytotic release of il- <dig>  <cit> . these findings are consistent with the present results, in which subjects with ct or tt genotype at il- <dig> , ag or gg genotype at cyslt <dig>  and gg genotype at il-4rα  were estimated to be at high risk for pathogenesis of caa . however, 2-snp interaction between cyslt <dig>  and il-4rα   markedly affected the 3-snp interaction.

in the present study, we examined correlation between caa and  <dig> snps in  <dig> genes using an ann model. we think that there are not a few main effects and interactions which can explain development of multifactorial disease like caa, because it is thought that interactions of genetic risk factors might be different individually among caa patients in spite of same disease. so it is very important to select multiple genetic factor models associated with multifactorial disease like caa with high concentration ratio. we found that  <dig> of these snps are important factors in development of caa. important combinations among these  <dig> snps were also extracted. as described above, several of these combinations  have been found to be important factors in allergic disease, in previous biological and epidemiological studies. we also found several novel important combinations. the present data about important combinations suggests multiple patterns of caa development. it should be noted that these findings were obtained automatically using an ann model constructed without priori knowledge. using an ann model with  <dig> snps, we were able to discriminate between cases and controls with more than 70% accuracy. we concluded that the ann is an effective tool for predicting development of caa, using snp data. however, further investigation of other genetic and environmental factors associated with caa is needed. we previously constructed an advanced modeling method, the fuzzy neural network  <cit> , which is an ann model. when this model is applied to analysis, the susceptibility rules of interaction can be explicitly and linguistically described. also, it can be used to describe susceptible interaction between genetic factors such as snps and environmental factors such as favorite foods and life style. using the rules obtained with this model, we can plan protocols for preventive treatment of subjects with high-risk genetic profiles. network analysis tools such as anns can be applied to analysis of multifactorial disease using snp data such as selection of important snps or description of interactions between snps.

CONCLUSIONS
relationships between caa and  <dig> snps in  <dig> candidate genes were analyzed using an ann. in diagnostic prediction, ann discriminated cases from controls more precisely than lr. from among the  <dig> original snps analyzed, we selected  <dig> snps that were closely associated with caa. calculating p-value using the χ <dig> test, we found that 2-snp and 3-snp combinations of these  <dig> snps were associated with caa. the ann was able to represent associations between caa and these 2-snp or 3-snp combinations using complicated nonlinear relations. thus, the ann can be used to characterize development of complex diseases caused by multiple factors.
