BACKGROUND
pea- <dig> is a  <dig> kda phosphoprotein that regulates both erk map kinase and death receptor apoptosis pathways  <cit> . pea- <dig> regulates erk map kinase by binding directly to it and maintaining active erk in the cytoplasm  <cit> . by this mechanism pea- <dig> alters the transcriptional response to growth factors that stimulate the erk map kinase pathway. pea- <dig> can also bind and alter activation of the kinase rsk <dig>  which is a substrate of erk  <cit> . indeed pea- <dig> acts as a scaffold to enhance erk activation of rsk <dig> and subsequent creb transcription  <cit> . moreover, in pea- <dig> null cells  rsk <dig> activation is impaired  <cit> . pea- <dig> is expressed in both neurons and astrocytes throughout the brain  <cit> . a physiological role of pea- <dig> in the brain has not been determined though it has been implicated in diverse pathological conditions including type ii diabetes  <cit> , glioma  <cit> , and breast cancer  <cit> .

the erk map kinase pathway is involved in learning and memory. in particular, it is implicated in spatial learning and fear conditioning  <cit> . both of these processes, in some forms, are thought to be dependent on the hippocampus. at the molecular level, blocking erk activity impairs spatial learning  <cit>  and long term potentiation   <cit> . activated erk translocates to the nucleus where it initiates transcription by phosphorylating transcription factors including elk- <dig> and c-fos. in the cytoplasm erk may phosphorylate several substrates including cytoskeletal proteins like stathmin as well as other kinases such as rsk <dig>  <cit> . rsk <dig> is a complex kinase containing two kinase domains. like erk, activated rsk <dig> can translocate into the nucleus where it activates transcription factors including c-fos and creb  <cit> . moreover, rsk <dig> is expressed at high levels in structures of the brain such as the hippocampus, neocortex and purkinje cells that are associated with cognitive function and learning  <cit> . mutations in rsk <dig> cause coffin-lowry syndrome   <cit> . cls patients suffer from cognitive impairment and skeletal deformations  <cit> . furthermore the cognitive impairment associated with cls correlates with a reduction in rsk <dig> activity  <cit> . similarly, mice in which rsk <dig> has been deleted have impaired spatial learning and reduced exploratory behavior  <cit> . one target of rsk <dig> activity is the transcription factor creb. there is a growing literature describing the importance of creb in long term potentiation  and learning  <cit> .

because pea- <dig> can regulate both erk and rsk <dig> we assessed pea- <dig> knockout  mice in a series of tests that measure learning, sensory/motor function, and stress reactivity. we found that deletion of pea- <dig> protein in c57bl/6j mice causes specific defects in spatial learning abilities.

RESULTS
pea- <dig> is expressed at high levels throughout the nervous system. pea- <dig> null  mice have been reported to have normal brain sizes and astrocyte numbers and to be born in roughly normal ratios  <cit> . no differences in brain morphology have been identified in these mice. pea- <dig> is known to modulate both erk and rsk <dig> signal transduction and may therefore affect cellular function in the nervous system. we therefore designed a series of tests to determine if pea- <dig> ko mice suffered from sensory-motor, behavioral, or learning deficiencies compared to wildtype  controls. ko mice did not differ from the wt mice in their body weight at any time during the experiments . both groups reacted similarly to food deprivation, shedding approximately  <dig> to 8% of gross body weight during deprivation. additionally, both ko and wt mice recovered pre-deprivation weights at the same rate and magnitude.

stress and activity tasks
in elevated plus maze tests kos  deposited more bolli in the maze than wts ,   suggesting that exploration by kos into the open arms of the plus maze increased these subjects' stress reactivity. however, the stressful nature of the open arms did not diminish kos exploration relative to wts. kos spent more time than wts in the open arms of the elevated plus maze  . this difference was not due to an increase in basal activity, as both groups made a comparable amount of arm crossings . however, kos chose to enter open arms significantly more often than their wt counterparts did . there was also a trend for kos to make a first open arm entry more quickly than wts. therefore kos tended to exhibit higher levels of anxiety or fear with a concomitant increase in exploration of the maze.

an alternative test of anxiety and exploration is the open field test. in this test ko and wt mice exhibited similar numbers of total movements in the open field . however in contrast to the elevated plus maze findings, ko mice did not differ from wts in the amount of time spent in 'open' stressful quadrants relative to 'safe' wall quadrants. exploration of the open quadrants of an open field can be used as an index of an individual mouse's inclination for novelty seeking. in this experiment, pea- <dig> ko and wt mice did not differ in their proclivity to engage new environments.

in the black/white preference test, mice have a propensity to spend more time in the black, dimly lit half of the preference chamber presumably because they find this chamber less stressful than the well-lit white half and because animals are introduced into the apparatus on the black side. in this test, both ko and wt groups spent more of the total time during testing in the black/dim side of the chamber as is normal. however, ko mice made their initial crossing into the white side of the chamber more slowly than wt mice  and spent significantly less time in the white well lit side  . this difference was not due to differences in activity between the groups, since both made a similar number of crossings between the two sides of the apparatus. this test is further evidence that ko mice suffer increased levels of anxiety or fear.

as a separate measure of fear we examined ko mouse performance in the straight alley/escape test. the startle stimulus  used during this test typically elicits rapid running , which serves as an index of fear. though the escape distance for pea- <dig> null mice was only 63% of that for wildtype mice , this difference was not significant . groups did not differ in their latency to explore the escape straight alley, nor did they show a preference for either end of the apparatus . hence, ko mice do not appear to suffer increased fear as measured in this test. in total, the differences noted above for the elevated plus maze and the black/white preference test suggest a pattern of behavior in ko mice  that does not reflect a consistent pattern of differences in stress or anxiety related behaviors. thus these differences may reflect other, unidentified causes.

to assess potential differences in physical activity that may contribute to differences in these tests, the time spent by ko and wt mice on a running wheel was assessed. pea- <dig> null mice utilized the running wheel significantly less than wildtype mice during the  <dig> hours of the test . this difference was not due to less running behavior during the light cycle, when all mice spent significantly less time running, but was due to kos spending significantly less time running during the night cycle  . thus ko mice were generally less active than their wt counterparts.

sensory motor tasks
to determine whether pea- <dig> null mice have normal responses to pain we assessed their sensitivity to heat by measuring their latency to lick or shake a hind paw when placed on a hot plate. there was a tendency for pea- <dig> ko  mice to react slower to the painful stimulus than wt mice   . differences in pain reactivity could possibly affect learning tasks that entail painful reinforcement, such as associative fear conditioning.

we next examined if ko mice' strength or motor function are impaired. pea- <dig> ko mice performed worse than wt mice in tests that assessed grip strength or coordination, measured by latency to fall from an apparatus in three sensory/motor tasks . specifically, kos  were impaired compared to wts  in successful completion of the balance beam test  , the roto-rod test  , and movements during the screen climbing test  . in all three tests, kos fell off more quickly. these deficits appear to be unrelated to balance or coordination, as both groups performed identically on the balance platform  .

learning tasks
in odor discrimination, ko mice did not differ from wts during learning . both types of mice mastered the task across trials  . however, kos  were impaired in their mean latency to locate the reinforcer  on the first training trial  . kos also tended to make more errors than wt mice  on the first trial , although this difference did not approach significance. the comparable learning rates exhibited by ko and wt mice suggests that pea- <dig> ko mice retain normal olfactory abilities and learning about olfactory stimuli. in the lashley iii maze, ko mice  did not differ from wt  mice in acquisition of this task, as measured by either latency to transverse the maze or the number of errors committed in route to the goal box . over trials, the latency of both groups to locate the goal box decreased, as did their errors . as in odor discrimination, on trial  <dig> , ko mice recorded longer latencies to find the goal box  and committed more 'errors'  than wts.

in these experiments mice learn to suppress movement to avoid the aversive stimuli . to control for individual basal levels of activity and exploration, step-down latencies were calculated by utilization of a ratio of post training latencies as a function of pre-training latencies. both ko  and wt  mice significantly increased their latencies to step down after training , but there was no difference between kos and wts in performance in this test .

to assess associative fear conditioning ko and wt mice were exposed to a stimulus  that terminated with a mild foot shock. the latency of water-deprived mice to complete  <dig> licks of a water tube during the white noise presentation was used as a measure of whether the mouse had learned to associate the white noise with the shock. increased latency to complete  <dig> licks during the noise compared to before  the white noise in each mouse indicates associative fear conditioning. there was no significant difference between ko  and wt  mice in this task . kos did not differ significantly from wts in basal drinking rates or in consumption of water during testing

in reinforced alternation tests, mice learn to alternate arm choices in an elevated t-maze to obtain food reinforcement. the number of training trials required before an animal learns to consistently alternate arm choices is an index of the rate at which they learn the pattern. previously, with our adaptation and training procedures young adult cd- <dig> and balb/c mice often began to perform without error after 8- <dig> training trials. however in these experiments with c57bl/6j mice neither ko nor wt mice learned the correct pattern competently . during acquisition trials, kos only performed at chance rates, while wt mice chose the correct arm approximately 65% of the time. because of the poor performance during reinforced alternation training, representative groups  of wt and ko mice were given an additional day of training . though both groups improved correct choices to nearly 75%, there was no mean difference between kos and wts .

we next tested pea- <dig> null mice in the morris water maze. acquisition and performance in the spatial version of the morris water maze is dependent on an intact hippocampus and is said to indicate the animals' representation of its environment as a "cognitive map"  <cit> . across the two days of training, ko  animals never improved their performance in locating the hidden platform  and the inability to master this spatial task is in marked contrast to wts  performance . this difference was not due to reduced strength or activity of the ko mice since all mice had similar swim speeds  on the first training trial before any learning had occurred . the path lengths of the ko mice, similar to their latency to find the platform, did not change during training . because wts learned the task, their path-lengths to the platform improved during training . not surprisingly, wt controls also out-performed kos during a probe trial after training . kos spent equivalent search time in the target quadrant as in the other three quadrants . this gross impairment was not due to kos inability to swim, their swim speed, or ability to stay on the platform.

similar to the water maze, the spatial version of the win/stay task in a plus maze requires animals to utilize a cognitive map or spatial cues. in contrast to the water maze, animals receive a food reward for successfully completing a trial rather than escape from water. in the spatial win/stay experiments ko  mice were impaired compared to wts ,  during the final four trials as measured by latency to navigate the maze and make an arm choice . while a tendency was observed for ko animals to make more errors in this task , this tendency did not reach statistical significance,  . since both ko and wt mice reduced errors throughout training, the increased latencies exhibited by ko animals suggest that ko mice might have an increased time latency relative to their wt counterparts

the pea- <dig> null mice appeared to be impaired in tasks that can be solved using a spatial strategy . to further explore this observation, mice were tested in a modified version of the spatial win/stay task. this test was executed in the same manner as the earlier spatial win/stay task with the exception that animals could correct wrong choices. in the modified win/stay task, mice received an additional day of training . under these conditions, all mice improved performance during training , but at no point during training did the kos differ from the wts in errors committed . again, however, the ko mice took significantly longer navigating the maze to make correct arm choices . again, these results suggest that ko animals require a longer time to execute ultimately accurate decisions under the demands of spatial navigation.

discussion
pea- <dig> is a small phosphoprotein that binds to erk and regulates erk signaling  <cit> . in particular, pea- <dig> can regulate activation of rsk <dig> and subsequent activation of creb-mediated transcription  <cit> . the physiological and developmental function of pea- <dig> is obscure. we now report that pea- <dig> null mice exhibit cognitive deficiencies that are specifically limited to spatial learning tasks. other forms of learning do not appear to be affected in any obvious way. the pea- <dig> null mice also exhibit reduced nocturnal activity and complex changes in behavior related to exploration of stress- or anxiety provoking environments. although ko mice exhibit weak grip strength, they appear to have normal visual, auditory, and olfactory abilities. since several of the learning tasks in which ko mice exhibit normal performance can provoke stress or anxiety , the learning deficits that were consistently observed on spatial tasks are unlikely mediated by elevated stress reactivity or anxiety in these mice. thus it appears that pea- <dig> may play a critical role in the mediation of spatial learning, possibly via its enrichment in the hippocampus.

pea- <dig> binds tightly to erk and rsk <dig> and thereby regulates the outcome of erk signaling  <cit> . more recently we have found that pea- <dig> forms a complex with both erk and rsk <dig> and is essential for erk activation of rsk <dig>  <cit> . in fact, pea- <dig> enhances rsk <dig> activation of creb transcription. thus in pea- <dig> null mice, creb activity is presumed to be reduced. this could account for the resultant spatial learning defects. we are currently testing this hypothesis in more detail.

mutations in rsk <dig> cause the x-linked coffin-lowry syndrome  <cit> . aside from skeletal and muscular defects, male patients also suffer from cognitive disabilities as determined by very low intelligence quotients   <cit> . mice that are rsk <dig> null also have learning disabilities though they appear less severe than those of coffin-lowry patients. like pea- <dig> null mice, the rsk <dig> nulls have impaired spatial learning and changes in exploratory behavior  <cit> . because we see decreased activity of rsk <dig> in our pea- <dig> null mice  <cit>  we propose that the spatial learning disability they exhibit is the result of this reduced rsk <dig> activity. it may be that people with related cognitive problems, but who have normal rsk <dig>  may have mutations in pea- <dig>  this remains to be determined. we should note that the published analysis of coffin-lowry learning deficiencies does not break down learning tasks to examine memory or tasks that might be related to spatial learning in particular. so it is unclear how the deficits in spatial learning in mice might relate to learning deficiencies of human patients.

recently, morphometric analysis by mri of coffin-lowry patients showed reduced cerebellum and hippocampus volumes  <cit> . however, no differences in brain size or morphology have yet been reported for rsk <dig> null mice. moreover, we and others have not identified any differences in the brain size or morphology of the pea- <dig> null mice  <cit> . detailed analysis of the hippocampus of pea- <dig> null mice has not revealed any differences in cellular morphology or size. because of this we suspect that the learning disabilities in mice are due to differences in erk map kinase signal transduction and creb activation in the cells of the hippocampus rather than changes in its morphology.

in most respects the learning disabilities of pea- <dig> null mice are similar to those of mice with impaired erk activity. however, we found no significant change in fear conditioning in the ko mice, whereas there is literature reflecting a role for erk in this process  <cit> . it may be that this is a result of where in the defect in the map kinase pathway is located. erk can activate both elk- <dig> and creb , whereas rsk <dig> can activate only creb. thus it may be that the fear conditioning defects observed in the erk experiments arise from decreased elk- <dig> activity, while the changes in spatial learning may stem from changes in creb activity. this remains to be tested. alternatively, the differences in fear conditioning may arise from differences in the methods used.

we report that pea- <dig> deficient mice exhibit an impaired ability at spatial learning tasks. they also have weaker forepaws than their wt counterparts do. it is therefore possible that the reduced forepaw strength may contribute to the performance of the mice in the spatial learning tests. however, in the spatial water maze, swim speed and path length analysis suggest that the reduced forearm strength in ko mice was not responsible for their impaired performance. the fact that ko mice did not display impaired basal activity in sensory motor tests also supports the premise that the learning impairments in spatial tasks were not contingent on gross differences in sensory/motor function between pea- <dig> null and wt mice. in other learning and sensory/motor tests, the pea- <dig> null mice showed no deficiencies. thus the spatial learning defect is most likely independent of the differences in forepaw strength.

our analysis was performed on adult mice in which pea- <dig> had been completely deleted. the defects we observe could therefore be due to changes arising from lack of pea- <dig> function in early brain development, lack of pea- <dig> metabolic function in the behaving adult, or both. the current study cannot distinguish between these possibilities. however, this work provides the framework for additional studies that could address this issue. for example, we could create conditional knock-outs of pea- <dig> in the brain in which pea- <dig> is deactivated in the adult brain only after development is complete. these mice could then be run through a similar battery of tests to determine whether the effects are due to effects on brain development or adult brain function. these experiments are currently being planned.

CONCLUSIONS
the ability to learn is a critical trait of many organisms  <cit>  and the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that mediate learning could have tremendous significance. here we demonstrate that deletion of the pea- <dig> gene caused impaired spatial learning in tasks that depend heavily on the hippocampus, and that this deficit was independent of typical performance confounds such as stress reactivity and emotionality. thus pea- <dig> may play a critical role in the mediation of spatial learning, possibly via its enrichment in the hippocampus. the molecular analysis of pea- <dig> function in the brain may therefore supply new insights in our understanding of basic mechanisms of learning.
