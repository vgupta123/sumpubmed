BACKGROUND
animals produce ‘chemical signature mixtures’  <cit> , released as volatile molecules, that are used to locate potential food resources, find mates, conduct social interactions and detect predators and pathogens  <cit> . olfaction plays a key role in many aspects of animal behaviour including foraging, prey avoidance, locating oviposition sites, and mate recognition. odorant-based chemical communication in insects has played a pivotal role in maintaining their status as the most species-rich group of animals on earth  <cit> . a sophisticated olfactory system for detecting and interpreting odorants in the environment is a prerequisite for the survival and reproduction of insects  <cit> . the coleopteran  and lepidopteran  insect orders are the most species-rich animal orders on earth  <cit> . in moths, chemical communication is a major factor in premating isolating, and a sex pheromone underlies reproductive behaviour and mating  <cit> . in beetles, olfaction plays a major role in finding mates and locating oviposition sites; however, it contributes even more to foraging for food resources, aggregation and prey avoidance  <cit> . in all of these insects, olfaction is well utilized at different levels, beginning with the reception of ligand at the periphery, the processing of signals at the antennal lobes, the merging of olfactory signals and other sensory modalities in the processing centres of the brain, and, finally, the rendition of olfactory signals into behaviour  <cit> . the economic importance of these insects can be attributed in part to the sensitivity and selectivity of their olfactory systems, which are important for locating their favoured hosts . the evolution of a highly sensitive and adaptable olfactory system is believed to be a key factor that has allowed insects to spread into virtually every environment on earth  <cit> .

insects can sense bitter, sweet, and salty tastants, odours, pheromones, humidity, carbon dioxide, and carbonated water . insects detect odorants primarily in the antennae, and on the surface of the antennae there are thousands of olfactory sensilla  that contain olfactory receptor neurons   <cit> . odorant molecules are detected by the antennae, and these events are transformed into electrical signals that are further processed by the central nervous system. the orns are the primary units of olfaction and can generally be divided into distinct classes based on their response spectra. insect olfaction is initiated when volatile odours bind to odorant-binding proteins  to cross the sensillum lymph surrounding the olfactory neuron dendrites. because volatile odorants are highly hydrophobic, and because odorant-degrading enzymes  are present in the sensillum lymph, odorants do not pass easily through the sensillum lymph surrounding the dendritic membranes of the orns. hence, obps reversibly bind odorant molecules  in a protective cleft, carry them to the receptor protein and protect them from ode breakdown  <cit> . a large number of soluble secreted proteins are also found in the sensillum lymph, including chemosensory proteins , which are expressed over the entire body of the insect. finally, these odorant carrier proteins deliver ligand molecules to the olfactory receptors  located in the dendritic membranes of receptor neurons  <cit> . three types of insect chemosensory receptor proteins have been identified: odorant receptors , ionotropic receptors  and gustatory receptors . insect ors are heteromultimer formed by two proteins, an or and a ubiquitous coreceptor . the binding of odorant molecules by the or–orco receptor complex opens the channel, and the chemical signal is then transformed into an electric signal that is transmitted to the brain . irs are three trans-membrane proteins homologous to the ionotropic glutamate receptor family ligand gated ion channels in vertebrates. irs are narrowly tuned for amines and acids, whereas ors are broadly tuned for esters and alcohols . grs are seven trans-membrane proteins that are distantly related to ors and are expressed in the antennae, proboscis, palps and tarsae. they are tuned for co <dig> detection and taste   <cit> . sensory neuron membrane proteins  are another class of proteins involved in pheromone reception at the orns; they are located in the dendritic membranes of pheromone sensitive neurons. snmps are thought to trigger ligand delivery to receptors  <cit> . snmps are members of the cd <dig> family of proteins and may function during the binding and transport of hydrophobic ligands  <cit> .

although substantial developments have been made in our knowledge of the molecular mechanism of odorant detection in insects, many previous studies were based on drosophila and bombyx mori, and information about the molecular basis of olfaction in coleopterans is sparse. there is still no consensus about the exact function of each olfactory gene family in coleoptera, and very few studies have reported on the olfactory gene families in coleopteran insects . coleopteran insects are highly diverse and have adapted to live in a wide range of environmental conditions. certain species cause major economic losses in many agricultural crops. hence, the study of the olfactory senses that lead to their fitness is of the utmost importance for developing successful pest control strategies.

palm trees are cultivated all over the world. the red palm weevil  rhynchophorus ferrugineus , the most harmful invasive insect species to palm trees, causes major economic losses in the cultivation of coconut, date and oil palms. the date palm is an extremely important fruit crop in middle eastern countries, where the rpw poses a serious threat, causing heavy losses every year. an infestation starts when an adult females lays eggs in the cuts, wounds, cracks and crevices in the trunk of the palm tree, from the collar region near the roots to the base of the frond petioles/axils near the crown. the rpw larvae bore into soft tissues such as the tree crown, the base of the petioles, the trunks of young palms or the rotting tissue of waning palm trees  <cit> . when rpws attack a tree, individual insects are generally able to locate the tree with a male aggregation pheromone , and this signal leads to a coordinated mass-attack that often leads to the death of the palm tree  <cit> . recently, the united states department of agriculture  listed the rpw as a highly dangerous invasive species of significant quarantine importance  <cit> . because of the ecological and economic effects of this pest, extensive knowledge regarding its olfactory communication should be collected. investigations on the molecular mechanism of olfaction in the rpw provide insights into chemoreception in the rpw and may be useful for understanding odour detection in other coleopterans. in the present study, we used high-throughput sequencing to identify highly expressed transcripts of obps, csps, ors, irs, grs and snmps in the rpw antennae, and our results will be fundamental for the functional characterization of the chemosensory proteins in rpw. enhanced knowledge of the molecular mechanism of olfaction and the functional characterization of the receptor proteins in rpws could ultimately lead to the identification of new targets for olfactory disruption and the development of safe pest control strategies.

methods
ethics statement
the red palm weevil collections were made with the direct permission of a cooperating land owner  and weevil culture was maintained in our laboratory as mentioned below. we reaffirm that none of the rpw collections were from national parks or protected wilderness areas. besides, these weevils are definitely not an endangered species.

insect rearing and antenna collection
the red palm weevil culture was maintained in our laboratory on sugarcane stems as described previously  <cit> . briefly, the emerged adults were sexed, separated and placed individually in round 90 mm × 110 mm  plastic jars, which were covered with perforated caps. the adults were introduced into rearing jars with two freshly split sugarcane pieces for feeding and egg laying. two weeks after pupation, the cocoons were harvested from the sugarcane stems and individually incubated in round 70 mm × 90 mm plastic jars with perforated screw caps and were checked daily for adult emergence. after a short period of approximately 3– <dig> min in a freezer  for immobilization, the delicate antennae were cut from the bases of the adult insects. the dissections were performed under a simple light microscope, and the collected antennae were saved for rna extraction .

total rna extraction, cdna library construction and illumina sequencing
the antennae of ~ <dig> r. ferrugineus  <dig> to 10-day-old adult beetles were excised, and total rna was extracted from the antennae using a norgen purification kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the quantity and quality of the total rna were validated using a qubit®  <dig>  fluorometer , and the rna integrity was further confirmed using a  <dig> bioanalyzer . the aim of this study does not include a quantitative analysis of the chemosensory gene families in the r. ferrugineus antenna and therefore biological replicates were not considered.

paired-end cdna libraries were prepared using illumina protocols and sequenced on the illumina hiseq platform. briefly, a cdna library was constructed using a truseq™ rna kit , including purification of mrna, fragmentation of total rna, synthesis of the first and second strands of cdna, cdna end repair and adenylation at the 3′end, and adapter ligation and cdna fragment enrichment. the products were purified and enriched by pcr to create the final cdna library. finally, the cdna library was validated and quantified by a qubit®  <dig>  fluorometer.

the hiseq illumina sequencing was performed at the core sequencing facility of the king abdullah university of science and technology , jeddah, saudi arabia. the insert size of the library was approximately 306 bp. image deconvolution and quality value calculations were performed using illumina gapipeline <dig> .

data processing, assembly and annotation
a quality control step was first performed on the raw sequencing reads using the ngs qc toolkit  <cit> . standard rna adapter sequences and regions of poor quality were clipped using the clc genomic server and its ‘trim sequences’ tool. a de novo assembly was performed by the clc genomics server using the ‘scaffolding’ and ‘mapping reads back to transcripts’ options. the resulting de novo assembled transcripts were locally searched against a non-redundant  protein database using the blastx algorithm  in the standalone version of the blast+ tool  <cit> , and results were stored in the blast archive format asn. <dig>  the results were subsequently translated into the required format  using the blast_formatter tool. the xml blastx results were imported into the blast2go annotation tool. reads per kilobase per million  values were calculated for the assembled transcripts based on their mapping data according to the formula published in mortazavi et al.  <cit> .

gene identification and functional annotation
following assembly, each transcript was identified by local or web-based searches using the ncbi blastx and blastn programs  <cit> . blast hits with e-values < <dig> e −  <dig> were considered to be significant  <cit> , and genes were putatively assigned to each contig based on the blastx hits with the highest score values. the blast xml files were uploaded to blast2go, and mapping, gene annotation, interpro and kegg analyses were performed  <cit> . each gene was functionally annotated with respect to its molecular function, biological process and cellular component.

the transcripts that contained errors leading to incorrect assembly were edited using geneious v <dig> . <dig> , and de novo assembly of the isotigs was performed. the open reading frame  of each unigene was determined by using the orf finder tool . interpro analysis terms were assigned by blast2go  <cit>  through a search of the nr databases. to annotate the pooled assembled transcriptome, we performed a blastx search against the nr ncbi, uniprotkb and kegg databases using an e-value cut-off of  <dig> e −  <dig> 

comparative analysis of the beetle antenna transcriptome
the dendroctonus ponderosae and ips typographus   <cit>  antennal transcriptomes were downloaded from ncbi, assembled with the clc genomics server and saved as fasta files. a comparative analysis of r. ferrugineus, d. ponderosae and i. typographus antennal transcripts was performed based on the results of best bidirectional blastx hit . the objective of this study was to identify highly conserved and differentially expressed genes among the three coleopteran species.

candidate chemoreceptor proteins
blastx was used to search for ors, orcos, snmps, grs and irs in our ngs dataset. candidate ors, ir receptors and snmp genes were identified by blastx and blastn searches. sequence alignments were performed using the clustalx program  <cit> .

candidate genes involved in odorant transport
the putative odorant transport proteins obps and csps were identified by blastx and blastn searches as well as by searching for the “obp sequence motif” c1-x15–39-c2-x3-c3-x21–44-c4-x7-12-c5-x8-c <dig>  <cit>  and the “csp sequence motif” c1-x6–8-c2-x16–21-c3-x2-c <dig>  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis of the candidate receptor proteins
the r. ferrugineus obp, csp, or, snmp, gr and ir nucleotide sequences were used as queries  to the genbank database, and sequences from different insect species and their amino acids were retrieved and used to construct a phylogenetic tree. similarity analyses of the dna and protein sequences were conducted, and a multiple-sequence alignment was performed using the muscle program  <cit> , followed by manual inspection. a maximum likelihood analysis was performed, and a dendrogram was constructed using mega v <dig>   <cit> . the ncbi accession number for each gene is shown in the tree.

functional annotation
the assembled transcripts were used as queries in blastx against the non-redundant  ncbi protein database, uniprotkb, flybase and kegg, with an e-value cut-off of 10e −  <dig>  in general, the sequences had e-values between  <dig> e −  <dig> and  <dig> e −  <dig> . the sequence similarities between the r. ferrugineus antennal transcripts and the databases ranged from  <dig> to ~100 %  with a peak at 70 %  . a blast2go analysis of the  <dig>  antennal transcripts of r. ferrugineus identified  <dig> transcripts with blast hits,  <dig>  without blast hits,  <dig> with mapping results and  <dig>  annotated sequences . the sequences without blast hits may have low similarity to functionally similar genes in the database, to novel genes or to parts of the 5′or 3′utr regions or a large percentage of heavily spliced genes. the antennal transcripts of r. ferrugineus produced the most significant hits to the sequences of dendroctonus ponderosae, followed by the sequences of tribolium castaneum . the evidence code distribution for the blast hit chart indicates over-representation of the inferred electronic annotation  code, followed by the inferred by mutant phenotype  and inferred by direct assays  codes . the highest evidence code for the individual sequences was iea, followed by imp and, lastly, ida . the majority of the functional predictions from the coding sequences were obtained from uniprotkb, followed by flybase   .

by using blast2go to search the nr database, go terms were assigned, and an interproscan search resulted in ~ <dig>  interpro transcripts and  <dig>  ‘without interpro’ transcripts with an average length of 857 bp according to go-annotation. using this method,  <dig> transcripts were assigned to one or more go terms. annex was run after blast, and the interproscan results were annotated, resulting in the following:  <dig>  total original annotations,  <dig> new annotations,  <dig> original annotations replaced by new annotations due to specificity, and  <dig> confirmed annotations.

go analysis of the genes expressed in the r. ferrugineus antenna
the r. ferrugineus antennal transcriptome was go-annotated based on matches to interpro proteins. the annotation results and the distribution, go-level distribution, number of go-terms for the r. ferrugineus sequences with a specific length , annotation score distribution and percentage of the r. ferrugineus sequences with a specific length  are depicted in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  the proteins with associated go terms such as “molecular function”, “biological process” and “cellular component” were grouped and recorded at different match levels . the “cellular process”  and “metabolic process”  go categories had the most abundant transcripts within the biological process go ontology . in the “cellular components” go category, the most abundant transcripts were involved in ‘binding’  and ‘catalytic activity’  . in the “cellular components” go category, the transcripts were mainly associated with the terms ‘cell’  and ‘cell part’  . of the proteins with nr database matches, ‘binding proteins’ were the most abundant protein class. other highly abundant proteins included oxidoreductase proteins, kinases, peptidases, cytoskeletal proteins, ribosomal proteins and proteins involved in other major functional categories. of the direct go counts identified for the “biological process” ontology, ‘biosynthetic process’ and ‘cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process’ were among the first  <dig> dominant terms . of the categories enriched for the direct go counts identified as “cellular component”, ‘protein complex’, ‘nucleus’ and ‘cytoplasm’ were the most highly represented terms . in the “molecular function” ontology,  <dig> transcripts with binding functions and  <dig> transcripts with catalytic activities were annotated .

transcript abundance in the r. ferrugineus antenna
a summary of the highly expressed transcripts in the r. ferrugineus antenna is shown in table  <dig>  the highly expressed transcripts included apidermin  protein, a cuticular protein family of insects,   <cit>  and obp <dig>  <cit> . the obps , and csps  were highly expressed in the antenna with  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> rpkm, respectively, indicating their roles in odorant reception . additional highly abundant transcripts were found on contig  <dig>  encoding cytochrome p <dig> at  <dig> rpkm, which had 63 % identity with d. ponderosae cytochrome p <dig> cyp345e <dig>   <cit> . major house-keeping genes such as elongation factor, cytochrome c oxidase subunit i and cytochrome c oxidase i were highly expressed in the antenna of r. ferrugineus . interestingly, heat shock protein  <dig> was highly expressed in the r. ferrugineus antenna, and it showed 97 % similarity to lissorhoptrus oryzophilus .table  <dig> the most abundant mrna in r. ferrugineus antenna



comparative analysis of the antennal transcripts
by comparing r. ferrugineus antennal transcripts with d. ponderosae and i. typographus transcripts in the sra database, a large number of antennal transcriptome sequences were found to be identical. after assembly using the same parameters as used for r. ferrugineus, we obtained  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes from d. ponderosae and i. typographus, respectively .

we selected the top bidirectional hits for each transcript from r. ferrugineus, d. ponderosae and i. typographus  for the comparative analysis. when comparing the r. ferrugineus antennal transcripts with d. ponderosae and i. typographus, we found that 17 % of the top blast hits were shared between r. ferrugineus and the other two coleopterans, and 25 % of the blast hits were unique to r. ferrugineus . a comparison of r. ferrugineus and d. ponderosae showed that 18 % of the blast hits were shared, and 45 % of the blast hits were unique to r. ferrugineus . similarly, a comparative analysis of the blast hits of r. ferrugineus and i. typographus showed that 18 % of the blast results were shared, and 44 % of the blast hits were unique to r. ferrugineus. r. ferrugineus, d. ponderosae and i. typographus shared 8 % of their blast hits, whereas r. ferrugineus and d. ponderosae shared  <dig>  % of their blast hits, and r. ferrugineus and i. typographus shared  <dig>  % of their blast hits . in total, we identified  <dig>  highly conserved genes between r. ferrugineus, d. ponderosae and i. typographus. of these genes,  <dig> were duplicated, or were predicted to be splice variants or partial sequences . because the rpw genome is not available, alternative splicing was not predicted. however, multiple alignment of r. ferrugineus conserved genes produced the same blastx results. interestingly, we found splice variants in a few cases . one of the candidates among the conserved genes is a group of several orthologous sequences of heat-shock proteins , including the heterogeneous hsp family of small heat shock proteins  , which play an important role in protecting organisms from stress  <cit> . diversification and evolution of hsp is of critical importance in increasing cold/heat stress resistance and has implications for adapting to climate change  <cit> . the chemosensory candidates among the conserved gene orthologous are or-  <dig>   <dig> and 23; obp-30; csp- <dig> and 19; snmp-1; gr- <dig> and  <dig> and several ir candidate genes . a large portion of the r. ferrugineus transcripts  had no hits in the available antennal transcriptomes of the other two species. this may be due to the larger data set  of r. ferrugineus and the lower coverage in the other studies . another possibility may be alternatively spliced genes. we were unable to remove the splice variants because the reference genome of r. ferrugineus was not available. the lack of blast hits for many r. ferrugineus transcripts in d. ponderosae or i. typographus may be due to novel genes with unique functions or highly conserved genes.fig.  <dig> venn diagram showing comparative analysis of r. ferrugineus antennal transcriptome. comparative analysis of r. ferrugineus  antennal transcriptome with those of d. ponderosae  and i. typographus   <cit> . the diagram shows the blast homology genes in the antenna of r. ferrugineus, d. ponderosae and i. typographus. the comparative analyses antennal unigenes were performed based on the best bidirectional hits results 



odorant binding proteins in r. ferrugineus
in the r. ferrugineus antennal transcriptome, a total of  <dig> obp transcripts were identified based on blastx results and the “obp sequence motif” c1-x25–68-c2-x3-c3-x31–46-c4-x8–29-c5-x8-c <dig>   . a six-cysteine protein structure is the most characteristic feature of insect obps  <cit> . the arrangement pattern of the conserved cysteines in the r. ferrugineus obp family is comparable to the patterns in other insect obps  <cit> . an rpkm value analysis revealed that seven obps  are highly abundant transcripts in the r. ferrugineus antennal transcriptome  . we followed the previously proposed obp naming system  <cit> , which refers to obps missing c <dig> and c <dig> as minus-c obps, and obps carrying more than six conserved cysteine residues as plus-c obps. in the r. ferrugineus antennal transcriptome data, we identified twenty six minus-c obps that are missing the second and fifth cysteines , eight plus-c obp members, including eight obps carrying additional conserved cysteines located upstream of c <dig> , and two obps carrying conserved cysteines between c <dig> and c <dig> . an alignment of the r. ferrugineus obp proteins shows low average pairwise sequence identity between the obp family members . the arrangement pattern of the conserved cysteines  of the contigs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of c <dig> to c <dig> are similar to the spacing patterns when all six cysteines are present .

a phylogenetic tree based on neighbour-joining  is shown for the r. ferrugineus obps in additional file 8: figure s <dig>  a phylogenetic tree was also constructed using the maximum-likelihood method, and we identified six possible insect obp subfamilies by following the a previously described method  <cit> ; in addition, r. ferrugineus obps were putatively identified based on comparison with b. mori obps  <cit>  . based on phylogeny, one candidate abpi , two candidate plus-c , four candidate crlbps , four candidate abp ii  and three candidate minus-c  were identified . the phylogenetic tree shows that rpw1_contig_ <dig> is closely related to rpw1_contig_ <dig>  and possesses insect pbb-gobp protein domains; hence, it is included within the abpii subfamily . based on the blastx analysis, contig_ <dig>  contig_ <dig>  contig_ <dig>  contig_ <dig> and contig_ <dig>  contain insect pheromone/odorant binding protein domains and are placed in the pbp_gobp family ; however, they share only 16 % identity. rpw1_contig  <dig> and rpw1_contig  <dig> show a 54 % amino acid identity with the scarab beetle anomala octiescostata  and a. cuprea , respectively, which are involved in the detection of sex pheromone compounds  <cit> . rpw1_contig_ <dig> is in the abp i family  <cit> , and shows a 35 % identity with obp <dig> of helicoverpa armigera, and it has been reported that harmobp <dig> is expressed in the antenna and leg of h. armigera  <cit> . the obp family includes the pheromone-binding proteins  and the general odorant-binding proteins ; the former are responsible for transporting pheromone molecules, and the latter transport general odorants such as plant volatiles. the pbps in dipterans and lepidopterans have been characterized, but little characterization has been conducted for the pbps in coleopterans  <cit> .fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood  tree of the odorant binding protein . bombyx mori obps  <cit>  were used as reference to classify the r. ferrugineus obps and the ml analysis was computed using mega   <cit>  . the coleopteran obps; t. castaneum obps, d. ponderosae and i. typographus  <cit>  were also used to construct the tree with r. ferrugineus obps. r. ferrugineus obps transcripts and node are marked with red color. r. ferrugineus obps putatively identified are highlighted. genbank accession numbers are indicated. scale  <dig>  amino acid substitution per site



we observed sound bootstrap support in the abpii subfamilies and slight bootstrap support in the other subfamilies of the obps in r. ferrugineus . the five abpii obps share an average of 31 % identity. the crlbp subfamily represents four monophyletic obps and includes b. mori obps , t. castaneum obps  and i. typographus obps . the four crlbp r. ferrugineus obps share an average of 23 % identity. as reported earlier in d. melanogaster  <cit> , the minus-c subfamily of the r. ferrugineus obps represents a significant number of monophyletic  antennal transcripts  that all lack a conserved c <dig> and c <dig> and are predicted to be pseudogenes, non-olfactory obp-like proteins, or novel obps that diverged from moth obps and are unique to r. ferrugineus . these proteins need to be characterized. the  <dig> minus-c obps share an average of 33 % identity. based on phylogeny, we identified contig_ <dig> and contig_ <dig> as part of the plus-c subfamily, and we found that contig_ <dig> carries two additional cysteines between c <dig> and c <dig>  and contig_ <dig> carries additional cysteines upstream of c <dig> and downstream of c <dig>  based on a multiple sequence alignment, we identified eight plus-c subfamily members  whose sequences share an average of 47 % identity. all of the plus-c subfamily members exhibit six conserved cysteine residues, c1-c <dig>  and they also carry an additional conserved cysteine located upstream of c <dig> or downstream of c <dig> .

we built an ml tree based on an alignment of the obp sequences from six species: r. ferrugineus, b. mori, d. melanogaster, d. ponderosae, t. castaneum and i. typographus. these species represent three orders . the six subfamilies for r. ferrugineus defined above were also found in the clades with b. mori obps . the highly abundant obp transcript rpw_unigene_ <dig> forms a cluster with tcasobpc <dig>   <cit> . the other coleopteran-specific obps that form clades with t. castaneum, d. ponderosae and i. typographus include rpw1_contig_ <dig> , rpw1_contig_ <dig> , rpw1_contig_ <dig> , rpw1_contig_ <dig> , rpw1_contig_ <dig> , rpw1_contig_ <dig> , rpw1_contig_ <dig> , rpw1_contig_ <dig> , rpw1_contig_ <dig> , rpw1_contig_ <dig> , rpw1_contig_ <dig> , rpw1_contig_ <dig>  and rpw1_contig_ <dig> . the number of r. ferrugineus obps detected in the present study is much higher than in two other curculionids, d. ponderosae and i. typographus   <cit> . the phylogenetic comparison also showed that several of the unique obps in r. ferrugineus antennae form two monophyletic groups . the first group includes rpw_unigene_ <dig> and  <dig>  contigs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which form a cluster with tcasobpc <dig>  tcasobpc <dig>  tcasobpc <dig>  tcasobpc <dig>  dponobp <dig>  itypobp <dig>  itypobp <dig> and itypobp <dig> . the second group includes rpw1_contigs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which form a clade with itypobp <dig> and tcasobp <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the b. mori obps are not represented in this clade. this result suggests that there was a lineage specific expansion of the obps in coleopterans and lepidopterans. this result also suggests that significant species-specific expansion and divergence have occurred in r. ferrugineus. in total,  <dig> putative obps were identified in r. ferrugineus, and their rich diversity indicates that r. ferrugineus obps play a fundamental role in odour detection and olfactory sensation. the genus rhynchophorus is the foremost pest of palm trees in the world. the fact that adult weevils are able to locate food resources using plant volatiles as well as the range of volatiles  exploited by this insect are direct indications of the divergence of its obps and the sophistication of its chemical communication systems.

chemosensory proteins  are approximately 100– <dig> residues long and present a conserved pattern of four cysteines forming two independent loops  <cit> . in this study, we identified  <dig> csps in r. ferrugineus antennae. based on rpkm values, contig_ <dig> is the most highly expressed of these antennal transcripts ; it shows high identity  with dponcsp <dig> in d. ponderosae  . orthologous csps were also found in t. castaneum . all of the r. ferrugineus csps have four highly conserved cysteine residues with a common spacing pattern  . the deduced csps share 20–63 % protein identity, showing that they belong to a diverse family of csp proteins . the protein sequence alignment shows that three aromatic residues , 116 w  or f  and 129y or f) are highly conserved within the r. ferrugineus csp protein family . these residues are most likely located at the binding site. it has been reported that these three aromatic residues block tunnel opening and closing and are present in all insect csps  <cit> . r. ferrugineus csps are conserved at y  <dig>  except for rpw_contig_ <dig>  which was replaced by a non-aromatic residue, gln . all of the other csps have conserved aromatic residues at  <dig> and  <dig> . the residue positions at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  are conserved. it has been reported that these functionally conserved residues are predicted to be involved in ligand binding in insect csps  <cit> . the r. ferrugineus csps have diverged; however, they share moderate sequence identity and retain all of the conserved aromatic residues, hydrophobic residues and alpha helical domains of lepidopteran csps .fig.  <dig> alignment of the r. ferrugenieus csps contigs with b. mori csp <dig>  highly conserved cysteine are shown with dark arrowhead above. conserved three aromatic residues , 116 w  or f  and 129y or f) shown in hollow arrowheads. hydrophobic residues at the two mouths of the channels are marked with double arrowheads, as reported with b. mori  <cit> . alpha helical domains  in r. ferrugineus is identified based on the b. mori, and the amino acids underlined



we built an ml tree based on an alignment of the csp sequences in seven species, r. ferrugineus, b. mori, h. virescens, t. castaneum, d. melanogaster, d. ponderosae and i. typographus, which represent two orders . phylogenetic analysis identified r. ferrugineus csps that were orthologous to b. mori csp <dig> , csp <dig> , csp <dig> , csp <dig> , csp <dig>  and csp <dig> , clearly indicating that these genes evolved from a common ancestral insect gene and that they retain conserved residues in both orders . csps are more highly conserved than obps across insect species and are widely expressed in different parts of the insect body  <cit> . surprisingly, the csp clade representing r. ferrugineus contigs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and rpw_csp_unigene  <dig> forms a cluster with the b. mori and h. virescens csps without any csp representatives from t. castaneum, d. ponderosae or i. typographus . the r. ferrugineus csp rpw_contigs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> show high identity with dponcsp <dig>  tcascsp <dig> and dponcsp <dig>  respectively, which form a separate clade that diverged from dipterans and lepidopterans. hence, we assume them to be a coleopteran specific csp lineage . these csps may have important roles in r. ferrugineus physiology and semiochemical perception that need to be elucidated. similarly, phylogenetic analysis also identified a dipteran-specific clade that did not include any of the csps in the coleopterans and lepidopterans, indicating an order-specific expansion of the csp lineage . interestingly, r. ferrugineus csps  are more similar to the csps in b. mori and h. virescens than those in coleopterans . this may be due to a lack of available information on coleopteran antennal csps  <cit> . the number of r. ferrugineus csps identified in the current study is higher than the number of csps that have been identified in other two curculionids, d. ponderosae and i. typographus   <cit> . undoubtedly, the csps that affect chemoreception in r. ferrugineus could have important roles as carriers in odorant perception. further studies are needed to understand the potential roles of antennal csps in r. ferrugineus communication.fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood  tree of the chemosensory proteins . bombyx mori csps  <cit>  were used as reference to identify the r. ferrugineus csps and the ml analysis was computed using mega   <cit>  . insect csps: d. melanogaster, h. virescens, t. castaneum, d. ponderosae and i. typographus were also used for the construction tree. r. ferrugineus csp transcripts and nodes are marked with red color and b. mori csps and nodes are with blue color. coleopteran specific csp clades are highlighted with yellow color. dipteran specific csp clade are highlighted with green. genebank accession nos are indicated. scale  <dig>  amino acids substitution per site



odorant receptors in r. ferrugineus
volatile ligands are first captured by insect antennae. they are then absorbed through pores on the surface of the sensilla. odorant receptors  expressed on the dendritic membranes of orns are activated by odorants alone or by odorant–obps complexes  <cit> . although ors have been studied more intensively than other olfactory proteins, a mechanism for the binding of odorant ligands to odorant receptors has recently emerged in which ligand specific ors require dimerization with the highly conserved gene or83b or the odorant coreceptor . in principle, odorant molecules bound by the or–orco receptor complex initiate channel opening. the orco protein belongs to a seven transmembrane protein family that represents the only conserved or protein among divergent insect species and is particularly expressed only in tissues harbouring olfactory sensory neurons  <cit> .

seventy-six ors were annotated in the rpw antennae transcriptome, which is more than the number of ors found in d. ponderosae  in the same curculionidae family  <cit> . the average sequence length of the rpw ors was  <dig>  bp. forty four of the ors likely represented full length or genes because they were longer than 1 kb in size, whereas  <dig> contig sequences were most likely partial sequences with sizes of less than  <dig>  kb. the expression of the rpw ors in the antenna transcriptome was relatively low compared with other contigs, as indicated by the average rpkm value of  <dig> , whereas the highest rpkm was  <dig>  and was observed in seven subfamilies  . we built a phylogenetic tree to visualize the lineage-specific subfamily expansion of the rpw ors from the highly conserved odorant coreceptor, dmelorco/dmelor83b   <cit> . the tree was built using a total of  <dig> amino acid sequences from t. castaneum   <cit> , followed by rpw , m. caryae   <cit> , i. typographus and d. ponderosae   <cit> . the lineage subfamily groupings agreed with previous studies of the above coleopterans.fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood tree of candidate odorant receptor  proteins from r. ferrugineus. ml analysis was computed using mega   <cit>  . insect ors: t. castaneum, m. caryae, d. ponderosae and i. typographus were also used for the construction of the tree. r. ferrugineus ors transcripts and nodes are marked with red color. the branch containing d. melanogaster orco was used as outgroup to root the tree. the different subfamily  proposed as shown in the figure. genbank accession nos are indicated. scale  <dig>  amino acid substitutions per site. refer additional file 10: table s <dig> for the details of genbank accession nos



the expressed rpw ors were largely grouped into the three subfamilies  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which is similar to the groupings reported for i. typographus and d. ponderosae  <cit>  . subfamilies  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> exclusively consisted of t. castaneum ors, whereas subfamily  <dig> exclusively contained t. castaneum and m. caryae ors. we found that some of our rpw contigs were not grouped into the previously defined seven subfamily clade. thus, we propose to classify them into two new subfamilies. subfamily  <dig> contained two  <dig> rpw contigs  and one mcaror <dig>  this subfamily serves as a root for all of the previously defined subfamilies  and has the closest lineage to the orco subfamilies. subfamily  <dig>  consisting of rpw contigs  <dig> and  <dig> together with mcaror <dig>  was positioned on the clade of subfamilies  <dig> and  <dig>  in addition to the two newly proposed subfamilies, we found that the rpw contigs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> presented a different clade that expanded into three previously defined subfamilies , in a similar manner to rpw contig  <dig>  which expanded to subfamilies  <dig> and  <dig> 

subfamilies  <dig> and  <dig> have a similar composition, and all of the coleopteran ors were located in these clades. t. castaneum ors are the majority or in these clades ; followed by rpw contigs . subfamily  <dig> is interesting because it is a novel subfamily proposed by mitchell et al.  <cit> , and it contains the majority of coleopteran ors . in this seventh subfamily, the highest number of ors were associated with rpw contigs , followed by d. ponderosae, i. typographus and m. caryae with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ors, respectively.

we currently have genome-scale information about the ors in drosophila, anopheles, nasonia, tribolium, bombyx and apis. genome analysis of the d. melanogaster revealed the presence of  <dig> olfactory receptors , which are encoded by  <dig> genes, and  <dig> gustatory receptors , which are also encoded by  <dig> genes . in the a. gambiae genome,  <dig> olfactory receptors were previously identified  <cit> . the a. mellifera genome encodes  <dig> or genes  <cit>  and the b. mori genome encodes  <dig> olfactory receptors,  <dig> of which appear to be orthologs of helicoverpa virescens . the honey bee odorant receptor for the queen bee has been previously identified  <cit> . the a. aegypti genome was found to contain genes for  <dig> or receptors  <cit> . a putative chemoreceptor family consisting of  <dig> ors was identified in t. castaneum  <cit> . recently, a characterization of the odorant receptors of the cerambycid beetle has been reported  <cit> , including  <dig> putative ors. in the present study, we have presented  <dig> antennal ors in r. ferrugineus , and we have compared them with other or protein families to determine that there are coleopteran-specific ors as well as highly specialized r. ferrugineus ors. the specialization of certain ors signifies possible adaptation of r. ferrugineus to specialized ecological niches. further functional characterization studies of r. ferrugineus ors in a heterologous expression system are in progress.

pheromone receptors in r. ferrugineus
pheromone molecules are perceived at the periphery of the olfactory system by pheromone-sensitive sensilla primarily located on the antennae  <cit> . olfactory sensilla typically consist of three olfactory neurons with different diameters housed within a hair-like structure called the trichoid sensillum  <cit> . pheromone molecules transported to the dendritic membranes of orns are recognized by pheromone receptors , which are a subclass of insect ors  <cit> . in the present study, we found rpw aggregation pheromone candidate genes in the same clade as mcaror <dig> - <dig> -hexanediol) in rpw contig  <dig>  which is in subfamily  <dig>  and those in the same clade as mcaror <dig> and mcaror <dig> -2-methyl-1-butanol and 2-phenylethanol, respectively)  <cit>  in rpw contigs  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . mcaror <dig> shares 24 % amino acid identity with rpw1_contig_ <dig>  mcaror <dig> shares  <dig>  and 17 % identity with rpw1_contig_ <dig> and rpw_or_unigene <dig>  respectively, and mcaror <dig> shares  <dig> and 13 % identity with rpw1_contig_ <dig> and rpw1_contig_ <dig>  respectively. a phylogenetic tree of coleopteran ors  with identified sex pheromones  was built using dmelorco as a root. insect sex pheromone prs were found to be grouped into one unique clade, which has the closest lineage to orco clades . within this sex pheromone clade, there are  <dig> rpw ors, rpw contigs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  that are potential pheromone receptor candidate genes . these six rpw contigs share 59–72 % amino acid identity with each other but share less than 20 % amino acid identity with moth prs. the pr clade also includes mcaror <dig>  mcaror <dig>  mcaror <dig>  <cit>  and itypor <dig>  <cit> , as well as beetle prs sharing 5–40 % amino acid identity. these results indicate that coleopteran pr proteins are highly diverged from moth prs. the richness of the diversity of the beetle prs indicates that they play a fundamental role in olfactory sensation related to pheromone detection. although there have been no reports of sex pheromone compounds in r. ferrugineus, in light of our new results, an evaluation of the female sex pheromones  of the rpw using sequential spme-gc/ms  is highly recommended.fig.  <dig> maximum likelihood tree of candidate odorant receptor  proteins from r. ferrugineus highlighting sex pheromone receptors and aggregation pheromone receptors. ml analysis was computed using mega   <cit>  . insect ors: t. castaneum, m. caryae, d. ponderosae and i. typographus were used for the construction of the tree. functionally characterized moth pheromone receptors  were included in the tree construction and pr clade is highlighted. r. ferrugineus ors transcripts and nodes are marked with red color. m. caryae aggregation pheromone receptors and nodes are marked with blue color. the branch containing d. melanogaster orco was used as outgroup to root the tree. the m. caryae aggregation pr  <cit>  is highlighted with yellow and moth pr with green color. genbank accession nos are indicated. scale  <dig>  amino acid substitutions per site



in the silkworm, b. mori sex pheromone signals mediated by a specific combination of olfactory receptors are exclusively expressed in a pair of adjacent pheromone-sensitive neurons of the male antennae  <cit> . the candidate pheromone receptor of b. mori has been functionally characterized  <cit> . the functional characterization and identification of putative receptors for the main sex-pheromone components of the moth species plutella xylostella, mythimna separata and diaphania indica  <cit>  and manduca sexta  <cit>  have been reported. in the genus ostrinia , pheromone receptors have been characterized primarily in o. scapularis and o. nubilalis, and receptors from different species have been functionally expressed in xenopus oocytes . an est data collection from the male antennae of spodoptera littoralis and heliothis virescens identified several putative pheromone receptors  <cit> . studies on pheromone receptors are extremely important because any changes  in pheromone receptors may ultimately contribute to speciation events  <cit> . although there are have been more than  <dig> pheromone receptors reported, there have been none from coleopterans, with the exception of mitchell et al.,  <cit>  who identified and functionally characterized the ors in the cerambycid beetle m. caryae and found that they are tuned to three molecules: the receptor mcor <dig> is sensitive to -2-methyl-1-butanol, mcor <dig> is sensitive to - <dig> -hexanediol, and mcor <dig> is sensitive to 2-phenylethanol. we predict that rpw contig  <dig>  which is an orthologous or to mcar <dig> of m. caryae  <cit>  and may have a role in aggregation pheromone  detection in r. ferrugineus. further research on r. ferrugineus ors, with a specific emphasis on molecular mechanisms, will facilitate better understanding of the behaviour of the rpw and will lead to a more informed approach to the management of this quarantine pest that inflicts significant damage every year on palm trees throughout the world.

ionotropic receptors in r. ferrugineus
insect ionotropic glutamate receptors , a conserved family of synaptic ligand-gated ion channels involved in chemosensation, have recently been characterized in d. melanogaster  <cit> . the iglur-family constitutes a distinct and divergent subfamily of ionotropic receptors  that are specifically expressed in insect antennae and function as chemoreceptors for the detection of a variety of chemical molecules  <cit> . another class of novel receptors that do not belong to the iglur-family includes the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid , kainate and n-methyl-d-aspartate  receptors, which have divergent ligand-binding domains that lack the characteristic glutamate interacting residues  <cit> . irs act in combinations of up to three subunits of individual odour-specific receptors and one or two of the broadly expressed coreceptors ir25a, ir8a, and ir76b  <cit> . the iglur-subfamily has an important role in synaptic transmission because the proteins are receptors for the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate; they have been well studied in vertebrates  <cit> . irs have been characterized in d. melanogaster  <cit> , b. mori  <cit>  and spodoptera littoralis  <cit> , but no such studies have been reported for coleopterans  <cit> .

we identified  <dig> candidate irs in the r. ferrugineus antennal transcriptome with very low expression levels in the r. ferrugineus antenna. however, rpw_contig_ <dig> was relatively highly expressed  . in the msa and phylogenetic analyses, the identified irs clustered with d. melanogaster irs , t. castaneum irs  and d. ponderosae irs  . an amino acid sequence alignment of the putative r. ferrugineus iglurs and irs and d. melanogaster iglurs and irs identified variations in the characteristic glutamate binding residues at certain sub-regions of the s <dig> and s <dig> domains. in the s <dig> lobe, the arginine residue  was not well conserved, whereas in the s <dig> lobe, the threonine  residues at the start and the glutamic acid  or aspartic acid  residues at the end were moderately conserved . in r. ferrugineus, we identified candidates for ir41a , ir21a , ir40a , and ir93a , as well as the coreceptors ir25a , ir76b  and ir8a . two ir21a  isoforms were identified: contig_ <dig> clustered with dponir21a and contig_ <dig> clustered with dmelir21a. we assume that either ir21a is diverged within the curculionidae family, or its candidate isoforms have not been reported in the d. ponderosae antennal transcriptome dataset  <cit> . another candidate r. ferrugineus ir, rpw1_contig_ <dig>  which shows identity with the demlir40a isoform g, has not been found in d. ponderosae and i. typographus  <cit> . in r. ferrugineus, ir41a, ir21a, ir68a and ir93a are extremely diverged from t. castaneum and d. ponderosae, with less than 30 % amino acid identity. nevertheless, the coreceptors ir25a, ir8a, and ir76b are highly conserved and show more than 50–65 % identity with other coleopterans. previous studies have reported on the dynamic patterns of expansion and divergence of ir families in both closely and distantly related species of insects occupying very different ecological niches  <cit> .fig.  <dig> unrooted tree of putative r. ferrugineus irs with those of d. melanogaster, t. castaneum, d. ponderosae and i. typographus irs. ml analysis was computed using mega   <cit>  . r. ferrugineus candidate ir, iglurs, kainite and nmda depicted in blue, green, red and pink font. genbank accession numbers are indicated. each color represents a group of orthologous sequences and group name and node are colored. irs, iglurs, kainite and nmda clades are highlighted with yellow, green, pink and grey colors, respectively. scale bar represents the  <dig>  amino acids substitutions per site



a phylogenetic analysis revealed no apparent orthologous relationship between r. ferrugineus and d. melanogaster irs or the three coleopteran  irs . however, we found that r. ferrugineus irs are more closely related to t. castaneum, d. ponderosae and i. typographus irs and display a number of coleopteran-specific clades . the ir subfamily consists of a set of conserved “antennal irs” that likely define the first olfactory receptor family of insects. there are also species-specific “divergent irs” that are expressed in the peripheral and internal gustatory neurons, and they are associated with taste and food assessment  <cit> . a reciprocal best-hit analysis and phylogenetic analysis of the r. ferrugineus and drosophila irs  <cit>  identified several putative antennal ir orthologues in r. ferrugineus: ir68a, ir21a, ir40a, 93a and ir41a.

we searched for iglurs-subfamily receptors in the r. ferrugineus antennal transcriptome dataset and found the iglur, kainite and nmda receptor subfamily genes, with most of them sharing more than 80 % amino acid identity with t. castaneum. in the r. ferrugineus antennal transcriptome, exhaustive blastx searches identified  <dig> iglurs,  <dig> kainate receptor proteins and  <dig> nmda receptor proteins. interestingly, we did not find ampa-subfamily transcripts in the r. ferrugineus antennal transcriptome. in r. ferrugineus, the iglur-family is extremely divergent and exhibits an overall amino acid sequence identity of 5–79 % for iglurs, 7–71 % for kainate receptors and 5–48 % for nmda receptors. a phylogenetic analysis of the predicted iglur, kainate and nmda receptor protein sequences revealed that they are closely related to the members of the same clade , and they share similarity with dipteran iglur-subfamily receptors . among the iglurs,  <dig> r. ferrugineus transcripts form a single clade putatively identified as ir75p  and ir75d , which share 14-46 % amino acid identity. in r. ferrugineus, iglur_contig_  <dig> is orthologous to dmeliglur_ia and none of the coleopteran orthologous sequences are included this clade . however, r. ferrugineus iglur contigs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and orthologous sequences from t. castaneum form an identical clade . in r. ferrugineus,  <dig> transcripts of the nmda-subfamily were identified. among these, contigs  <dig> and  <dig> clustered with d. melanogaster and t. castaneum nmdas and share very low amino acid identity . hence, we can assume that they are highly diverged in insects. three nmda contigs  form a clade with t. castaneum, d. ponderosae and i. typographus and share more than 70 % amino acid identity. hence, they are predicted to be specific to coleopterans . among the  <dig> kainate-subfamily members identified in r. ferrugineus, three closely related clades are proposed: two clades representing  <dig> contigs sharing high amino acid identity with the drosophila kainate-subfamily and a third clade that is highly diverged from the d. melanogaster kainate family, with low amino acid identity  . in this study, we reported on several novel r. ferrugineus irs and iglurs-family receptors. further studies combining coleopteran families are needed to reveal the evolution of this novel class of receptors in relation to the ecology of the species. these combination studies will ultimately help to develop novel targets for manipulating this newly discovered receptor family.

sensory neuron membrane proteins in r. ferrugineus
sensory neuron membrane proteins  are a family of two trans-membrane domain proteins located in the dendrite membranes of odorant-sensitive orns, and they may function in the binding and transport of hydrophobic ligands  <cit> . two snmp subfamilies  have been identified to date, and snmp <dig> was found to be antenna-specific and was detected in pheromone-sensitive orns . snmp <dig> associates with pheromone-sensitive sensilla and is expressed in sensilla support cells, and it has been characterized from lepidoptera  <cit> . in the present study, we reported six candidate snmp-like genes in the r. ferrugineus antenna that all share an average 74 % amino acid identity . one snmp transcript with a relatively high abundance of transcripts in the antennal transcriptome, rpw_unigene_ <dig>  appears to be expressed at high levels  in the r. ferrugineus antenna and shares 69 % amino acid identity with d. ponderosae snmp <dig> . based on phylogenetic analysis and a blastx search, we identified three orthologous snmp1- like proteins  that show identity with t. castaneum and d. ponderosae snmp <dig>  and three orthologous snmp2-like proteins  that show similarity to t. castaneum and d. ponderosae snmp <dig> . in r. ferrugineus, snmp <dig> transcripts  appear to be highly conserved, with 88 % amino acid identity, compared with rpw1_snmp_unigene  <dig> and rpw1_snmp_unigene  <dig>  which share 67 % identity . in addition, two snmp <dig> transcripts  were found to share 77 % amino acid identity. a phylogenetic analysis of r. ferrugineus snmps with dipteran and lepidopteran insects shows a coleopteran-specific expansion of the snmp genes . among the coleopterans, r. ferrugineus and d. ponderosae show an expansion of snmp <dig> genes . rpw_snmp_unigen_ <dig> forms a cluster with d. ponderosae, and their amino acid alignment shows 70 % identity. rpw_snmp_unigene  <dig> and contig_ <dig> clustered with t. castaneum and d. ponderosae snmp <dig>  showing 67–71 % amino acid identity. these results strongly suggest that r. ferrugineus snmp <dig> originated from gene duplication events and remains distinct in this genus. in r. ferrugineus, snmp <dig> contig  <dig>  clustered with contig  <dig>  sharing 77 % amino acid identity, and it was found to be closely related to t. castaneum  . the proximity of these snmp <dig> genes in coleoptera suggests that they derived from gene duplication events.fig.  <dig> unrooted tree of putative r. ferrugineus snmps with d. melanogaster, d. pseudoobscura, culex pipiens, a. gambiae, a. aegypti, t. castaneum and d. ponderosae snmps. ml analysis was computed using mega   <cit>  . genbank accession numbers are indicated. r. ferrugineus snmps are shown in red color. lepidoptera, diptera and coleoptera clades are highlighted in yellow, grey and green color respectively. scale represent  <dig>  amino acid substitution per site



the role of snmps in pheromone detection in diptera and lepidoptera antennae has been characterized  <cit> . the drosophila homolog of snmp <dig> is essential for the detection of the volatile pheromone 11-cis-vaccenyl acetate  <cit> . when hvcr <dig>  the receptor for the main pheromone component  of h. virescens, was expressed in transgenic drosophila, a snmp protein was required for neuron responsiveness  <cit> . however, hvcr <dig> can respond to z11-16:ald in in-vitro assays lacking snmps  <cit> . in the moth, both snmp <dig> and snmp <dig> are expressed in the antennae and body parts  <cit> . we still lack information on the exact molecular function of the snmp <dig> and  <dig> protein families, especially in coleoptera. the large diversity of snmp <dig> and  <dig> proteins within insect orders suggests that they contribute to the specificity of odour recognition  <cit> . in the present study, we identified three isoforms each of snmp <dig> and snmp <dig> in r. ferrugineus. because snmps have key functions in chemoreception in lepidoptera and diptera, further studies on their functional characterization and a comparative analysis of r. ferrugineus snmps could significantly contribute to clarifying their important functions in coleoptera.

gustatory receptors in r. ferrugineus
insect gustatory receptors  play an important role in the detection of taste chemicals and ultimately influence an insect’s decisions about food, mates and egg deposition sites  <cit> . grs belong to a highly conserved clade of insect proteins, and their functional characterization has been reported in d. melanogaster and b. mori  <cit> . in addition,  <dig> uncharacterized grs have been reported in t. castaneum  <cit> . we identified  <dig> grs in the r. ferrugineus antennal transcriptome with very low expression levels  . based on phylogenetic analysis, we discovered conserved insect-specific grs orthologous to dmelgr21a , 92a , 43a , 68a , 85a  and 98b . a phylogenetic analysis of r. ferrugineus, d. melanogaster and t. castaneum grs shows a coleopteran-specific expansion of grs . the phylogenetic tree also identified many closely related grs in t. castaneum, which form a single clade. similarly, three unique r. ferrugineus grs , which form a single clade near the t. castaneum clade, were identified in the antennal transcriptome. the proximity of these r. ferrugineus grs suggests that they are derived from gene duplication events. these trends indicate a dynamic pattern of the expansion and divergence of grs in closely related species, and they also suggest that grs contribute to the specificity of taste detection. one specific clade representing r. ferrugineus grs  and several t. castaneum grs is predicted to be coleopteran-specific and diverged from d. melanogaster gr66a and 57a. in the r. ferrugineus antenna, contig  <dig> was found to be closely linked to d. melanogaster dmelgr85a, and its sequence has diverged from the dipteran clade. no representative grs have been reported in t. castaneum and d. ponderosae .fig.  <dig> unrooted tree of putative r. ferrugineus grs constructed with those of d. melanogaster, d. ponderosae, i. typographus and t. castaneum. ml analysis was computed using mega   <cit>  . r. ferrugineus gr transcripts and node are marked with red color. r. ferrugineus grs putatively identified as gr92a , 21a , 98b , 68a , 43a  and 85a  are highlighted in green, pink, purple, blue, gray and red color. t. castaneum specific gr clade is shown in peach color. coleopteran specific clade close to dmel66a is shown in yellow color. genbank accession numbers are indicated. scale represent  <dig>  amino acid substitution per site. refer additional file 10: table s3for the details of genbank accession nos



insect grs denote a highly divergent chemoreceptor family across all insects  <cit> . limitations on investigating their functional characterization have led to a critical knowledge gap in this field. the reported functional characterizations of insect grs include gr5a, gr61a, gr64a, e and f, and gr43a  and gr21a/63a  from d. melanogaster  <cit> , and gr <dig> and gr <dig> from b. mori   <cit> . in the present study, we found orthologous sequences to isoforms 21a, 92a, 43a, 68a, 85a and 98b in the r. ferrugineus antenna as well as several species specific grs. the large diversity of grs in coleopterans suggests that they contribute to the specificity of taste detection, and they might have diverged from diptera. nevertheless, little is known about the specific functions of grs in coleopterans. further studies on the functional characterization and a comparative analysis of coleopteran grs could significantly contribute to our knowledge about their important functions.

CONCLUSIONS
the red palm weevil, rhynchophorus ferrugineus, is listed as a major invasive pest, and it is a serious threat to palm trees all over the world. we sequenced the r. ferrugineus antennal transcriptome, which, at  <dig>  transcripts, represents the largest data set published to date for a coleopteran antennal transcriptome. we found great richness and diversity of r. ferrugineus obps and csps. beetle-specific lineage expansions of ors are direct indications of divergence, and they reveal the sophistication of the chemical communication systems in r. ferrugineus. we classified r. ferrugineus ors into seven subfamilies of coleopteran ors and predicted two new subfamilies. we also identified putative aggregation pheromone receptors from r. ferrugineus that grouped into a unique beetle clade. several highly diverged ir orthologues were identified, including unique gr orthologues for co2-sensing and sweet tastants, as well as a highly expressed snmp isoform. this study provides strong background information on novel olfactory multi-gene families, and it may provide potential targets for disrupting the chemical communication system in r. ferrugineus as a means of pest control. the data will be useful for functional characterization studies that will ultimately facilitate a better understanding of the behaviour of r. ferrugineus, and the information will enable a more informed approach to the management of this quarantine pest that inflicts significant damage each year to palm trees throughout the world.
