BACKGROUND
snake venom is a cocktail of biologically active proteins with multifarious pharmacological effects representing the inverse of the physiological processes that maintain prey homeostasis  <cit> . venom defines the ecology, life history, and evolution of venomous species due to its involvement in prey capture, digestion, and defense  <cit> . positive selection has been repeatedly detected in toxin genes and reflects the significant contribution of venoms to fitness  <cit> . these molecular signals of adaptive evolution coupled with compositional variation suggest that toxin diversification is an adaptation to diet and may reflect a predator-prey arms race  <cit> . snake venom components exert selective pressures on both prey  <cit>  and predators  <cit> , and potentially offer a unique, dual perspective on predator-prey coevolution.

new world coral snakes  consist of three genera  and over  <dig> species and subspecies, inhabiting a diverse array of habitats from the southern united states to central argentina  <cit> . the eastern coral snake  is native to the forests of the southeastern united states and is mainly ophiophagous, preying upon smaller snakes and other squamates  <cit> . bites from micrurus species can be lethal  <cit>  due to the pre- and postsynaptic effects of the neurotoxic venom components that dominate coral snake venoms , and polyvalent antivenom has been shown to be ineffective at treating bites from all micrurus species  <cit>  and is currently unavailable in the united states  <cit> . a full characterization of all venom components may allow the design of more effective polyvalent antivenom  <cit> , but coral-snake venom composition is poorly understood in comparison to that of old world elapids  <cit> , mainly due to the difficulty of procuring sufficient venom quantities during milking for standard proteomic techniques  <cit> . high-throughput sequencing approaches are capable of identifying thousands of loci, enabling a detailed examination of the evolutionary forces shaping venom composition at the molecular level. we describe the first high-throughput transcriptomic characterization of an elapid venom gland to date. we sequenced the venom-gland transcriptome of m. fulvius with illumina technology using the paired-end approach of rokyta et al.  <cit> , and used the generated sequence data to examine the relationship between toxin heterozygosity and gene duplication events and uncover distinct expression patterns in highly expressed and extremely diverse toxin gene families.

RESULTS
high venom complexity revealed by means of sequencing
our high-throughput transcriptomic analysis revealed high venom complexity in m. fulvius, comparable to the diversity of toxin components recently identified in the venom-gland transcriptome of the eastern diamondback rattlesnake   <cit> . we generated  <dig> , <dig> pairs of  <dig> nucleotide raw reads and merged  <dig> , <dig> pairs on the basis of overlap at their 3’ ends, following the approach of rokyta et al.  <cit>  and rodrigue et al.  <cit> . these merged reads had an average length of  <dig> nucleotides with average phred scores of  <dig>  the iterative assembly process described by rokyta et al.  <cit>  coupled with a reference-based assembly using nontoxin transcripts previously described in the venom-gland transcriptome of c. adamanteus resulted in the identification of  <dig>  unique, full-length nontoxin coding sequences and  <dig> unique, full-length toxin coding transcripts .

transcript abundances were estimated by mapping  <dig> million reads to unique, full-length sequences with a minimum match percentage of 95% as described in rokyta et al.  <cit>  for c. adamanteus, against whose results we will be making comparisons. toxin transcripts were grouped into clusters based on <1% nucleotide divergence for abundance estimates. this enabled us to account for allelic variation, recent duplication events, and possible sequencing errors while also allowing reads to be mapped to a unique sequence rather than to multiple sequences, resulting in a more accurate estimation of abundance levels. our estimates of abundance reflect mrna levels and not necessarily protein abundances; the relationship between mrna and protein levels is not always straightforward  <cit> , and the construction of a complete genotype-phenotype map requires proteomic analyses .

the  <dig>  nontoxin transcripts accounted for  <dig> % of the reads. the  <dig> full-length toxin transcripts were grouped into  <dig> clusters  and accounted for  <dig> % of the reads. in total, we accounted for  <dig> % of the reads , comparable to the amount identified for c. adamanteus using a similar approach  <cit> . while the overall percentage of reads mapping to identified transcripts was similar for m. fulvius and c. adamanteus, toxin expression levels were quite different . the toxin transcripts identified in m. fulvius accounted for nearly half of the total sequencing reads  while the toxin transcripts in c. adamanteus accounted for approximately one-third  of the total reads   <cit> . the numbers and abundances of nontoxin coding sequences were much lower in m. fulvius than in c. adamanteus, despite an increase in assembly effort , as  <dig>  nontoxin transcripts accounted for  <dig> % of the total reads in m. fulvius while  <dig>  nontoxin transcripts accounted for  <dig> % of the total reads in c. adamanteus . the venom-gland transcriptome of c. adamanteus was characterized by large, hemorrhage-inducing toxins such as snake venom metalloproteinases , proteins that presumably require extensive downstream processing by nontoxin machinery prior to becoming mature, active toxins  <cit> . the vast majority of highly expressed nontoxin sequences identified in the transcriptome of c. adamanteus were involved with proteostasis   <cit> , and the reduction in the expression levels of nontoxin transcripts in m. fulvius could potentially reflect a difference in the maintenance, production, and folding requirements of the venom components of each species. the venom of m. fulvius was dominated by three-finger toxins  and phospholipases a <dig> , relatively short toxins that may not require the degree of downstream processing needed by larger toxins to become functional. this suggests that venoms dominated by smaller proteins differ in the transcriptional effort expended on toxins relative to nontoxins in comparison to venoms characterized by high-molecular weight components, with small-component venoms expressing toxins at much higher levels relative to nontoxin production. the largely proteinaceous composition of venom makes it metabolically costly to produce  <cit> , and a reduction in the machinery necessary for the production of functional toxic proteins may confer an energetic benefit to species expressing smaller peptides and enzymes. simple, smaller toxins have a reduced mutational target relative to larger proteins as a function of sequence length, potentially reducing the ability to evolve effective counterdefenses to resistance development in frequently envenomed prey  <cit>  and predators  <cit>  where more complex venoms would be advantageous. however, as our hypotheses are based on a comparison between a single representative of each family, sequencing additional members of viperidae and elapidae are needed to test whether these putative differences in transcriptional effort are fixed or unique to m. fulvius and/or c.adamanteus.

toxin class expression patterns
we identified  <dig> unique, full-length toxin transcripts representing  <dig> toxin classes or families which clustered into  <dig> groups with <1% nucleotide divergence. clusters could include alleles, recent duplicates, or assembly/sequencing errors. these clusters accounted for  <dig> % of the total reads , and nearly all of the high-abundance transcripts coded for toxins . of the  <dig> toxin clusters identified,  <dig> were among the top  <dig> most highly expressed genes , while only  <dig> of the  <dig> toxin clusters identified in c. adamanteus were among the top  <dig> most highly expressed genes  <cit> . the expression patterns of the venom gland appear to be biased towards toxin production in c. adamanteus, but reach a more extreme level of specialization in m. fulvius. although sequencing a single specimen may not accurately reflect gene expression for all individuals of m. fulvius, our analyses provide a reference transcriptome for future work with the species. we used the number of reads mapping to a specific transcript as an estimate of its abundance as per rokyta et al.  <cit> . toxin transcripts were named by the toxin-class abbreviation followed by the cluster number and a letter if multiple transcripts were present within the cluster.

phospholipases a2
we identified  <dig> unique sequences of pla2s that grouped into  <dig> clusters, which accounted for  <dig> % of toxin reads and  <dig> % of the total reads . pla2s were the most abundant and diverse toxin class in the m. fulvius venom-gland transcriptome. pla2s are esterolytic en- zymes and are among the most toxic components of snake venoms, causing pre- and postsynaptic neurotoxicity, myotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, hemolytic activity, anticoagulant activity, and hypotensive activity among other effects  <cit> . conversely, svmps were the most abundant toxin gene family in c. adamanteus, with  <dig> clusters representing  <dig> sequences accounting for  <dig> % of the toxin reads and  <dig> % of the total reads  <cit> . pla2s accounted for more than twice the percentage of toxin reads and over three times the percentage of total reads than the most abundant class in c. adamanteus, demonstrating the extreme dominance of gene expression by the pla <dig> gene family in m. fulvius.

three-finger toxins
we identified  <dig> full-length transcripts and  <dig> clusters of 3ftxs, which accounted for  <dig> % of toxin reads and  <dig> % of the total reads . 3ftxs were the second most abundant and diverse toxin class, and with pla2s accounted for  <dig> % of the total toxin reads. 3ftxs are short , nonenzymatic proteins characterized by three β-stranded loops extending from a center protein core  <cit> . these proteins are common components of elapid snake venoms and exhibit postsynaptic neurotoxicity by inhibiting the binding of acetylcholine to the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, causing a blockage of neuromuscular transmission  <cit> . the venom-gland transcriptome of m. altirostris was dominated by 3ftxs, as this toxin family accounted for approximately half of the identified expressed sequence tags  <cit> . in m. fulvius, 3ftxs only accounted for  <dig> % of the total reads, reflecting vast differences in expression patterns within the genus.

long-chain neurotoxins
long-chain neurotoxins  were the third most abundant and fourth most diverse toxin class. we identified nine sequences, which grouped into seven clusters and accounted for  <dig> % of toxin reads and  <dig> % of the total reads . lcns are similar to the short-chain 3ftxs described above but contain an additional 6– <dig> amino acid residues and an additional disulfide bond  <cit> . while both antagonize muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, differences in the functional sites of these toxins correlate to differences in the specificity of their targets  <cit> . lcns were much more similar to one another than 3ftxs, being  <dig> % divergent at the nucleotide level and  <dig> % divergent at the amino acid level whereas divergence among members of the 3ftx class was extremely high, with a paucity of conserved nucleotides and amino acids across cluster members.

snake venom metalloproteinases
svmps were the fourth most abundant toxin class, represented by a single transcript which accounted for  <dig> % of the toxin reads and  <dig> % of the total reads . svmps display extensive local and systemic hemorrhagic activity associated with envenomation in viperids, but the role of these enzymes following micrurus envenomation is uncertain. these enzymes can be subdivided into classes based on differences in domain structure, and the transcript identified in the venom-gland transcriptome of m. fulvius is a member of the class svmp-iii, characterized by disintegrin-like, cysteine-rich, and metalloproteinase domains  <cit> . larger molecular weight toxins, such as svmps, are often absent from elapid venoms and are more common components in the venoms of viperids  <cit> . high metalloproteinase expression has been shown to be incompatible with high toxicity in rattlesnakes, being described by mackessy as a tradeoff between neurotoxicity and hemorrhagic activity  <cit> . high-molecular weight toxins such as svmps are the major causes of hemorrhage and necrosis commonly associated with viperid envenomations, and presumably aid in digestion and are most effective when localized at the site of the bite. conversely, toxins with systemic effects  such as 3ftxs are more effective when spread through the envenomated organism is rapid, resulting in prey immobilization. this dichotomy in pharmocological effects appears to hold in elapids as well, demonstrating the antagonistic effects of these components. yet in comparison to other transcriptomic work with micrurus species, svmp expression levels are nearly five-times higher in m. fulvius than in congeneric individuals  <cit> , suggesting a more active functional role for this toxin in m. fulvius. this hypothesis awaits proteomic verification and testing via comparative functional assays to quantify the activity of svmps in m. fulvius relative to congeners.

kunitz-type inhibitors
kunitz-type inhibitors  were the fifth most abundant and third most diverse toxin class present in the m. fulvius transcriptome, with nine transcripts and eight clusters accounting for  <dig> % of the toxin reads and  <dig> % of the total reads . kuns are characterized by possessing a compact tertiary fold and three disulfide bonds, functioning as both inhibitors of serine proteases and as neurotoxins by inhibiting calcium and potassium ion channels  <cit> . kun- <dig> was a very divergent transcript, being  <dig> nucleotides longer than the next longest transcript. it shared  <dig> % identity with a putative kun known from the australian elapid austrelaps labialis <cit>  and  <dig> % identity with a kun identified in the venom-gland transcriptome of c. adamanteus <cit> . this transcript is considered putative until a comprehensive functional characterization is completed. the removal of this extremely divergent transcript resulted in a maximum pair-wise nucleotide divergence of  <dig> % within kuns and a maximum pair-wise amino acid divergence of  <dig> %, reflecting the diversity of this toxin class, especially in comparison to lcns.

low-abundance toxins
pla2s, 3ftxs, lcns, svmps, and kuns accounted for  <dig> % of the reads mapping to toxin sequences ,  <dig> % of the toxin clusters, and  <dig> % of the unique toxin transcripts. the remaining low-abundance toxins fell into ten different classes, are listed under “other” in figure 1b and figure  <dig>  and are described in table  <dig> 

abbreviations. ctl c-type lectin, cregf cysteine-rich with egf-like domain, hyal hyaluronidase, laao l amino-acid oxidase, np natriuretic peptide, ngf nerve growth factor, nuc nucleotidase, pde phosphodiesterase, plb phospholipase b, vegf vascular endothelial growth factor.

heterozygosity and gene duplication
single nucleotide polymorphisms  were identified in the coding regions of toxin clusters and nontoxin sequences using the seqman module from the dnastar lasergene software suite following a templated alignment in ngen. we analyzed  <dig>  contigs and detected  <dig> snps in  <dig> transcripts . of these  <dig> transcripts,  <dig> coded for nontoxin proteins while the remaining nine snp-containing transcripts were identified as toxins. ten of the  <dig> nontoxin transcripts and two of the nine toxin sequences with variable sites contained multiple snps. a total of  <dig> snps were spread over  <dig> % of nontoxin transcripts while  <dig> snps were found over  <dig> % of toxin cluster sequences. of the snps identified in nontoxin transcripts,  <dig> % resulted in alterations to the amino-acid sequence, while  <dig> % of the snps identified in toxin transcripts resulted in a nonsynonymous mutation. overdominant selection favors polymorphism and increases genetic variability. synonymous snps are often predicted to be invisible to the sieve of selection, and elevated nonsynonymous rates at polymorphic toxin loci suggest that the diversity of toxin genes can at least, in part, be explained by overdominant selection. our snp calling approach only identified polymorphic sites as snps if the nucleotide occurred with a frequency ranging from 40–60%. therefore, sequences possessing snps were considered putative heterozygous loci, and we compared the frequency of heterozygous loci between classes to a χ <dig> distribution with one degree of freedom. toxin and nontoxin sequences accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total annotated transcripts, respectively. the frequency of heterozygous toxin loci was significantly greater than the frequency of heterozygous nontoxin sequences . toxin transcripts also possessed a much higher snp density than nontoxins. snp density was calculated as the number of snps per  <dig>  bases  in the coding regions of toxin and nontoxin transcripts containing snps  <cit> . nontoxin transcripts had a snp density of  <dig>  snps/kb while toxins had a snp density of  <dig>  snps/kb.

sequences in multitranscript clusters appear to represent different allelic states of heterozygous loci, potentially reflecting how heterozygote advantage can favor gene duplication. if duplicate genes confer an advantage by providing more of a specific gene product, duplication events involving genes that are already highly expressed would be most beneficial  <cit> . while duplication events of highly expressed toxin transcripts within the snake venom gland have been rampant throughout the evolutionary history of venomous species , this does not explain the increased heterozygosity detected in our analyses. gene duplication may also produce a selective advantage when overdominance occurs. in this scenario, carrying different alleles at a single locus is beneficial and gene duplication can ultimately result in the fixation of multiple advantageous alleles. heterozygosity occurred with a significantly higher frequency in toxin than in nontoxin sequences with nearly half of the polymorphic sites in toxins resulting in a nonsynonymous mutation, suggesting that heterozygote advantage may play a key role in driving gene duplication and allelic variation within toxin genes  <cit>  .

expression biases and sequence divergence following speciation
the maximum-likelihood phylogeny for  <dig> unique m. fulvius 3ftx cluster members was estimated under the hky+g model . expression levels were extremely biased toward a handful of sequences; four transcripts accounted for more than  <dig> % of the toxin reads mapping to 3ftxs. these high-abundance transcripts  are all members of multitranscript clusters, and duplication events and the number of alleles appear to be positively correlated with expression within the 3ftx toxin gene family. the maximum-likelihood phylogeny for  <dig> m. fulvius 3ftx clusters and  <dig> 3ftx transcripts from m. altirostris and m. corallinus was estimated under the hky+g model . two of the four most highly expressed m. fulvius 3ftx paralogs are in well-supported clades con- taining orthologs from both m. altirostris and m. corallinus. 3ftx- <dig>  while accounting for approximately  <dig> % of the 3ftx reads in m. fulvius, is in a well supported clade containing ten m. altirostris sequences indicating that orthologs to 3ftx- <dig> have undergone duplication events in m. altirostris. m. altirostris sequences were identified in a venom-gland transcriptome analysis where the toxin family accounted for  <dig> % of the  <dig> expressed sequence tags generated  <cit> , demonstrating that these transcripts are highly expressed. the apparent dominance of the 3ftx toxin family in m. altirostris by these transcripts, and the extremely low expression of 3ftx- <dig> in m. fulvius could reflect dietary differences between the species, as shifts in prey consumption have been known to be coupled with expression modifications that augment venom efficacy  <cit> . genes that are no longer effective are lost or silenced while effective genes are highly expressed and diversify, suggesting functional divergence among toxins occurs following speciation events  <cit> .

a maximum-likelihood phylogeny for  <dig> unique m. fulvius pla <dig> clusters was estimated under the sym+g model . expression levels for pla <dig> transcripts were much more evenly distributed across the entire gene family in comparison to 3ftx sequences. the most highly expressed 3ftx transcript, 3ftx-2a, accounted for  <dig> % of the total 3ftx reads while four transcripts accounted for approximately  <dig> % of the 3ftx reads. in the pla <dig> gene family, pla2-2a was the most abundant toxin family member, accounting for  <dig> % of the total pla <dig> reads and the four most highly expressed transcripts accounted for only  <dig> % of the reads mapping to pla2s. although these two families dominated toxin transcript expression levels in the m. fulvius venom gland, pla2s did so through uniform expression while 3ftx expression patterns were tremendously biased. pla <dig> transcripts also demonstrated less sequence divergence among clusters relative to 3ftx sequences. pla2s are esterolytic enzymes that share a conserved three-dimensional structure  <cit> , and the greater similarity between pla <dig> transcripts may be a result of more stringent conformational constraints. the conservation of crucial structures in pla <dig> enzymes ensures a functioning active site whereas the relatively short 3ftx peptides may be free of this limitation. lynch  <cit>  found that functionally critical sites were under strong purifying selection in pla2s, with strong directional selection being restricted to surface residues due to their interactions with specific targets in prey, enabling prey-specific adaptation while ensuring the functionality of the enzyme. the maximum-likelihood phylogeny for  <dig> m. fulvius pla <dig> clusters, three m. altirostris sequences, and a single m. corallinus sequence was estimated under the sym+g model . functional divergence among pla2s may also occur following speciation events  <cit> , as all three m. altirostris sequences constitute a monophyletic clade and are sister to pla2- <dig>  a transcript that accounts for <1% of pla <dig> reads in m. fulvius .

rampant gene duplication following the initial recruitment of toxin genes into the venom gland has led to the production of multigene toxin families  <cit> , including the highly expressed 3ftx and pla <dig> gene families present in the m. fulvius transcriptome. gene duplication can be advantageous by increasing the production of a beneficial gene product or permanently fixing multiple advantageous alleles. gene duplication can be followed by elevated rates of selection  <cit> , enabling genes to acquire new functions or divide single functions among several genes  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses of the 3ftx and pla <dig> toxin classes  demonstrate the pervasiveness of gene duplication throughout the evolutionary history of these toxin families, and suggest that the divergence of toxin genes occurs following speciation. zhang  <cit>  stated that species-specific duplication events can result in species-specific gene function and, subsequently, adaptation. this adaptation can result in divergence and the development of unique phenotypes  <cit> , which may be reflected in our phylogenetic analyses of multiple micrurus species.

intragenomic evolution of venom genes
positive selection in toxin genes has been repeatedly documented, reflecting the significance of venom to the fitness of venomous species  <cit> . selection analyses have taken a somewhat unsystematic approach, analyzing all sequences available with little regard for the evolutionary histories of the taxa involved  <cit> . here, we examine the intragenomic evolution of toxin classes within the m. fulvius genome. the codeml results for detecting the presence of positive selection are summarized in table  <dig>  the results from the m <dig> and m <dig> models are nearly identical to the results from the m <dig> and m <dig> models and are therefore not shown. we examined 3ftxs, kuns, lcns, and pla2s for the presence of positive selection as these represent the four most diverse and four of the five most abundant toxin classes identified. while the fourth most highly expressed toxin class was svmps, this class was represented by a single transcript and thus could not be included in our analyses.

dn/ds ratios are represented by ω; λ represents our test statistic which is negative twice the difference in log likelihoods compared across models to a χ <dig> distribution with two degrees of freedom; and p corresponds to the proportion of codon sites falling into one of three rate classes which are purifying selection, neutral selection, and positive selection, respectively. the model selected by mrmodeltest <dig>   <cit>  for the estimation of the maximum-likelihood phylogeny is given and n corresponds to the number of sequences used in the analysis. significant p-values are indicated by an asterisk.

the m <dig> model estimates a single ω value over all branches in the phylogeny and therefore is only capable of detecting evidence of selection when the majority of sites have experienced positive selection throughout their evolutionary histories  <cit> . under the m <dig> model, we detected strong evidence of positive selection  for the 3ftx, lcn, and pla <dig> toxin families. evidence of positive selection was not detected in the kun toxin family , and the extraordinarily high ω calculated for the lcn family  was a result of all polymorphic sites resulting in nonsynonymous substitutions. we also used site specific models  to detect rate variation among sites  <cit> . the 3ftx, lcn, and pla <dig> toxin classes rejected the null or nearly neutral model  in favor of the selection model  , demonstrating the pervasiveness of positive selection experienced by highly expressed toxin transcripts within the m. fulvius genome. the percentage of sites experiencing selection ranged from 16–56% with  <dig> ≤ω≤ <dig> . the kun toxin class did not reject the m <dig> model in favor of the selection model . the high ω value under the site specific models for the lcn class again reflects the absence of synonymous substitutions within the class. elevated rates of evolution have previously been documented in toxin genes  <cit> , and this accelerated evolution is most likely due to their direct involvement in fitness  <cit>  and may be reflective of a coevolutionary arms race with specific prey taxa  <cit> .

sequence accession numbers
the original, unmerged reads were submitted to the national center for biotechnology information  sequence read archive under accession number sra <dig>  the annotated sequences were submitted to the genbank transcriptome shotgun assembly database under accession numbers gaep01000001–gaep <dig>  and gaep01001951–gaep <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have described the most comprehensive transcriptomic characterization of an elapid venom gland to date, revealing venom complexity previously unknown from any new world coral snake  <cit> . transcriptional effort expended on toxins relative to nontoxins may differ between venoms dominated by high-molecular weight components and venoms dominated by smaller proteins. this reduction in the machinery required for the production of functional toxins may confer a metabolic advantage to species expressing smaller peptides and enzymes, but may also reduce the capacity of species to evolve effective counterdefenses to resistant prey or predators. toxin expression was dominated by pla2s and 3ftxs, yet these two gene families greatly differed in expression patterns. expression within the 3ftx family was extremely biased, being dominated by a handful of transcripts while pla <dig> expression was much more uniform. snp analysis revealed the frequency of heterozygous loci was significantly higher in toxins than in nontoxins with nearly half of the polymorphic sites in toxins resulting in a nonsynonymous substitution, suggesting overdominance may ultimately favor gene duplication and permanent fixation of advantageous alleles within the venom gland. we detected evidence of positive selection in three of the four most diverse and highly expressed toxin classes; sequence evolution or modifications of toxin expression patterns could increase the specificity of venoms for frequently envenomed prey items  <cit> . diet has been proposed to be an important selective regime in determining venom composition within micrurus species  <cit> , and elevated rates of selection suggest a coevolutionary arms race  <cit> .
