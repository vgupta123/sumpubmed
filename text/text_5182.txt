BACKGROUND
tuberculosis, the disease caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis , is the leading cause of human mortality, claiming nearly  <dig> million lives every year  <cit> . the naïve or resting macrophages are extremely prone to invasion by mtb bacilli and are unable to mount any anti-bacterial response associated with activated macrophages  <cit> . thus, the resting macrophage seems to provide an ideal niche where intracellular tubercle bacilli may reside, replicate and persist  <cit> . the proteins that are secreted by mycobacteria have gained particular attention in the recent years both as vaccine candidates and virulence factors  <cit> . some of these proteins like cfp- <dig> and esat- <dig> are encoded by the rd- <dig> region of mtb genome, a region consistently deleted in all bcg vaccine strains of m. bovis  <cit> .

mitogen-activated protein kinases  are evolutionarily conserved enzymes that are important in signal transduction. they play a diverse role in cell proliferation, cell death, cytokine production and cell differentiation. three main families of mapks are found in mammalian cells: c-jun-n-terminal kinases ; the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/ <dig> ; and the p <dig> mapk   <cit> . they play diverse roles in the cell, ranging from apoptosis, cell differentiation, cell proliferation, stress response, to production of proinflammatory cytokines etc.  <cit> . targeting the map kinase pathway is one of the favorable strategies adopted by the pathogens to survive inside the macrophages  <cit> . mycobacteria modulate mapk signaling to promote their survival in the host cells. studies on mapks have been done using virulent and attenuated strains of mycobacteria. m. avium has two strains; smooth transparent  and smooth opaque  which represent a more virulent and a less virulent phenotype, respectively. both smt and smo induced early phosphorylation of p <dig> upon infection; however, only the attenuated strain elicited sustained activation of p <dig> mapk. the virulent strains of mycobacteria caused greater inhibition of map kinases, particularly erk1/ <dig> pathway, as compared to the avirulent strains  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms involved in this phenomenon have not been investigated. here, we show for the first time that esat- <dig> protein can modulate the erk1/ <dig> group of map kinases by limiting its activation in the nucleus. the map kinase-inducible transcription factor c-myc is known to enhance cell proliferation as well as apoptosis  <cit> . here we show that by modulating the map kinase erk1/ <dig>  esat- <dig> down regulates the lps-induced c-myc gene expression in the macrophages.

RESULTS
esat- <dig> caused activation of extracellular signal regulated kinase1/ <dig>  in cytoplasm but not in nucleus
we studied the effect of esat- <dig> on the activation status of erk1/ <dig> group of map kinases. map kinases are activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli such as stress, growth factors, and cytokines. the activation of erk1/ <dig> occurs through phosphorylation; the activated or phosphorylated erk1/ <dig>  translocate to the nucleus  <cit>  where they phosphorylate and activate the downstream cognate transcription factors such as creb etc.  <cit> . we found that esat- <dig>  caused a time-dependent phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig>  in cytoplasm of raw <dig>  cells compared to unstimulated cells. in the figure  <dig> the erk1/ <dig> is shown as a doublet where upper band represents erk- <dig> with molecular weight of  <dig> kda and the lower band represents erk- <dig> with molecular weight of  <dig> kda. in general cytoplasmic perk1/ <dig> would have translocated to the nucleus to activate the downstream molecules, but in the case of esat-6-stimulated cells we did not observe any perk1/ <dig> in the nuclear extract at any of the time points under the observation period . to determine whether the effect of esat- <dig> was specific for erk1/ <dig> or not, we checked for the phosphorylation of another map kinase p <dig>  esat- <dig> triggered phosphorylation of p <dig> in both cytoplasm  and the nucleus , therefore the effect of esat- <dig> was specific for erk1/ <dig>  total p <dig> levels were constant over the experimental time period in both cytoplasm  and nucleus .

lipopolysaccharide triggered erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation in both cytoplasm and the nucleus
the absence of perk1/ <dig> from the nucleus of esat-6-stimulated raw <dig>  cells was specific for esat- <dig> treatment. to establish this, we stimulated the cells with the bacterial lipopolysaccharide , which is a general activator of macrophages  <cit> . in the raw <dig>  cells stimulated with  <dig>  μg/ml of lps for the same time points as before, we observed time-dependent phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> in both cytoplasm  and nucleus .

next we wanted to know whether lps can overcome the esat- <dig> imposed inhibition of phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> in nucleus, for this raw <dig>  cells were co-stimulated for the same time points with lps  and esat- <dig> . in the presence of esat- <dig>  lps caused only weak phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> in nucleus  compared to the lps alone. thus, esat- <dig> seemed to dampen the erk1/ <dig> signaling of the map kinase family by limiting the activation of erk1/ <dig> in the nucleus.

diminished erk1/ <dig> activation in the nucleus by esat- <dig> was due to some tyrosine phosphatase
to evaluate whether any phosphatase was involved in the dephosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> in the nucleus of esat- <dig> treated cells, raw <dig>  cells were stimulated with  <dig> μg/ml of esat- <dig> in presence of  <dig> mm sodium orthovanadate , which is a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor  <cit> . we found that in the presence of na3vo <dig>  perk1/ <dig> appeared in the nucleus . the activation of erk1/ <dig> in cytoplasm was observed as usual . since with esat- <dig> alone there was no perk1/ <dig> in the nucleus, but with na3vo <dig> treatment there was phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig>  so there might be some putative phosphatase dephosphorylating the perk1/ <dig> as it translocated from cytoplasm to the nucleus. we checked whether sodium orthovanadate alone could induce activation of erk1/2; in the cells stimulated with  <dig> mm na3vo <dig> for the same time points, we found weakly activated erk1/ <dig> in cytoplasm  and none in the nucleus . the graphs showing densitomteric analysis of the above erk blots are shown in figure  <dig>  the plots for cytoplasm and nucleus are shown separately.

to further confirm the observations from western blotting, kinase assay for erk1/ <dig> was done. the raw <dig>  cells were treated with lps and/or esat- <dig> and esat- <dig> and/or na3vo <dig> for  <dig> minutes and the kinase activity was assayed as described in methods. in cytoplasm  both lps and esat- <dig> increased erk enzyme activity over basal level. esat- <dig> treatment was found to have no effect on the erk kinase activity in the nucleus over the basal level ; furthermore, esat- <dig> antagonized the lps-induced erk activation. concurrent treatment with na3vo <dig> and esat- <dig> increased erk activation in the nucleus by more than 4-fold compared to the esat- <dig> alone . na3vo <dig> alone did not have any effect on erk kinase activity over the basal level. thus the kinase assay confirmed the earlier western blot observations.

esat- <dig> stimulated phosphatase activity in the nucleus
in order to ascertain if the absence of perk1/ <dig> in nucleus was really due to some phosphatase, we determined phosphatase activity associated with erk1/ <dig> for the same time points in the nucleus. determination of phosphatase activity showed that upon stimulation with esat- <dig> there was  <dig>  fold increase in the phosphatase activity at  <dig> minutes, and  <dig>  fold at  <dig> minutes ; the antibody control  in which cells were stimulated with esat- <dig> for  <dig> minutes but were not treated with anti-erk- <dig> antibody, showed less than  <dig>  fold increase in phosphatase activity over the basal level. the total erk1/ <dig> protein levels were found to be uniform in all the immunoprecipitated samples and absent in the antibody control .

esat- <dig> downregulated lps induced c-myc expression
next, we looked whether esat- <dig> could exert any effect at the level of gene expression; we monitored the expression of c-myc encoding a transcription factor c-myc, which is regulated by map kinases  <cit> . the protein c-myc plays a role in cell proliferation and programmed cell death  <cit> . we monitored the c-myc mrna levels by rt-pcr at  <dig> minutes after the addition of different stimuli. we found that esat- <dig> did not change the expression of c-myc over the basal level; however, the lps -induced c-myc expression was downregulated by esat- <dig>  also, addition of  <dig> mm na3vo <dig> along with esat- <dig> increased the level of c-myc expression compared to that obtained with esat- <dig> alone while na3vo <dig> alone did not affect the basal expression level of c-myc .

to determine whether the downregulation of c-myc gene expression by esat- <dig> was a consequence of the inhibited activation of erk1/ <dig> in the nucleus, we incubated the cells with esat- <dig> and na3vo <dig> along with mek- <dig> inhibitor pd <dig>   <cit>  and also p <dig> map kinase inhibitor sb <dig>   <cit> . as observed before, treatment with na3vo <dig> and esat- <dig> enhanced the c-myc expression over esat- <dig> stimulation. interestingly treatment with mek- <dig> inhibitor pd <dig> downregulated the c-myc expression to the level obtained with esat- <dig> stimulation while the p <dig> inhibitor sb <dig> had no effect on c-myc expression levels . since the addition of sb <dig> did not have any effect on c-myc levels, the p <dig> map kinase pathway was not involved in c-myc expression. additionally, we looked at the effect of esat- <dig> on the expression on lps-inducible genes. esat- <dig> was also found to down regulate lps-induction of several genes il-1β, bax, icam- <dig>  and tnfr- <dig> .

discussion
the present study demonstrates that esat- <dig> modulated the erk1/ <dig> group of map kinase. we also found that this modulation was achieved by inhibition of phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> in the nucleus. however, the phosphorylation of another map kinase p <dig> was not affected by esat- <dig>  nevertheless, lps, a general macrophage activator  <cit>  triggered phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> in both cytoplasm and the nucleus. this showed that the limited activation of erk1/ <dig> in the nucleus was specific for esat- <dig> stimulation. costimulation of cells with lps and esat- <dig> dampened the erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation in the nucleus compared to that obtained with lps alone; clearly esat- <dig> was exerting a strong inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> in the nucleus. our finding that the treatment of cells with na3vo <dig>  a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor  <cit>  along with esat- <dig> caused perk1/ <dig> to appear in the nucleus indicated that there was some phosphatase activity in the nucleus that was triggered upon stimulation with esat- <dig>  moreover, when this phosphatase activity was suppressed by na3vo <dig>  the perk1/ <dig> reappeared in the nucleus. the results of kinase assay further corroborated our observations from western blotting that phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> was concomitant with its activation. measurement of phosphatase activity associated with erk1/ <dig> in the nucleus showed that there was an increase in this activity over the given time period; this finding was consistent with our observation that following treatment with both esat- <dig> and a phosphatase inhibitor  there was an increase in phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig>  it was already established that erk1/ <dig> after getting phosphorylated in cytoplasm translocates to the nucleus  <cit> ; therefore at zero minute, we observed little perk1/ <dig> in the nucleus . our findings tend to suggest that although with increase in the erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation in the cytoplasm of the esat-6-stimulated cells, perk1/ <dig> must have migrated to the nucleus, but increasing phosphatase activity in the nucleus, again associated with esat- <dig> stimulation, dephosphorylated the perk1/ <dig> coming from the cytoplasm; therefore no perk1/ <dig> was detectable in the nuclear extract. since map kinases undergo rapid turnover in the nucleus, the levels of total erk1/ <dig> in the nucleus remained constant over the experimental time period.

the c-myc is one of the early response genes that encode a transcription factor c-myc, which is a key regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis. since c-myc expression was reported to occur through ras/raf/mek/erk pathway  <cit> , we studied the effect of esat- <dig> on c-myc expression in raw <dig>  cells. esat- <dig> itself did not have any effect on c-myc expression over the basal level. however the lps induced c-myc expression was found to be downregulated by esat- <dig> compared to lps stimulation alone. again treatment with esat- <dig> along with  <dig> mm na3vo <dig> increased the level of c-myc compared to that observed with esat- <dig> alone while na3vo <dig> alone did not have any effect on c-myc levels. these results can be explained by the dampening of lps-induced erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation in the nucleus by esat- <dig>  as noted above, treatment with na3vo <dig> along with esat- <dig> resulted in an increased level of erk1/ <dig> activation in the nucleus compared to esat- <dig> alone. this differential activation of erk1/ <dig> pathway resulted in differential c-myc expression. to further confirm the role of erk1/ <dig> pathway in c-myc expression, we determined c-myc expression in the presence of mek- <dig> inhibitor pd <dig>  <cit>  and p <dig> map kinase inhibitor sb <dig>  <cit>  along with na3vo <dig> and esat- <dig>  pd <dig> downregulated c-myc levels while sb <dig> did not have any effect on c-myc levels. the activation of erk1/ <dig> pathway in nucleus upon treatment with na3vo <dig> and esat- <dig> was abrogated by pd <dig> and hence c-myc levels were downregulated. since sb <dig> did not have any effect on c-myc expression, p <dig> map kinase was not involved in the gene expression. it confirmed the earlier observations of p <dig> phosphorylation from western blotting where there was no inhibition in p <dig> activation in cytoplasm or nucleus by esat- <dig> 

although there are reports that cfp- <dig> forms a 1: <dig> complex with esat- <dig>  <cit> ; however other studies  <cit>  have shown that there is discordance between secretion of cfp- <dig> and esat- <dig>  okkels and colleagues  <cit>  have shown that there are as many as  <dig> different forms of esat- <dig> and that the acetylation of esat- <dig> was required for complexation with cfp- <dig>  another study has shown that esat- <dig> as well as the cfp-10:esat- <dig> complex inhibited the pi- <dig> kinase-akt signaling, indicating that the active component involved in downregulating the macrophage signaling was the esat- <dig>  <cit> . our studies with cfp- <dig> and cfp-10:esat- <dig> complex did not show any inhibition of the erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation in cytoplasm or nucleus of the raw <dig>  cells . it has also been shown that esat- <dig> binds to the toll-like receptor- <dig>  and not tlr- <dig> on the surface of raw <dig>  macrophages, and causes inhibition of activation of transcription factors nf-κb and interferon regulatory factors  through the akt kinase pathway  <cit> . our studies suggest yet another mechanism, viz., modulation of the erk arm of the map kinase pathway, by which esat- <dig> could bring about deactivation of the host cell.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has shown that mycobacterial secretory protein esat- <dig> could inhibit erk1/ <dig> activation in the nucleus of raw <dig>  cells. this inhibition resulted in downregulation of lps-induced erk1/ <dig> activation in the nucleus and subsequent expression of c-myc, a key factor in macrophage activation. these findings underline the role of esat- <dig> in deactivation of the macrophage, the host cell for m. tuberculosis.
