BACKGROUND
termination of protein synthesis takes place in ribosomes in a response to stop codons in the "decoding" site. the proteins that control this process are called polypeptide chain release factors . in eubacteria there are two class  <dig> polypeptide chain release factors, rf <dig> and rf <dig>  recognizing uaa/uag and uaa/uga stop codons, respectively, whereas eukaryotes employ only one such factor, erf <dig>  which is able to decode all three nonsense codons  <cit> . in addition, translation termination in eubacteria and eukaryotes is stimulated by class  <dig> release factors, rf <dig> and erf <dig>  respectively. both class  <dig> factors are gtpases enhancing the termination efficiency by stimulating activity of class  <dig> release factors in a gtp-dependent manner  <cit> . rf <dig> is able to remove rf <dig> or rf <dig> from the ribosome after hydrolysis of the ester bond in peptidyl trna, i.e. to stimulate recycling of class  <dig> factors  <cit> . in contrast to eubacterial rf <dig>  eukaryotic erf <dig> functions in termination by applying its gtpase activity to assist erf <dig> with the stop codon recognition and/or ensures rapid and efficient hydrolysis of peptidyl trna  <cit> . importantly, this was shown upon the excess of erf <dig> when quantitative peptide release did not require recycling of erf <dig>  in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae erf <dig> and erf <dig> are encoded by the essential sup <dig> and sup <dig> genes, and often designated as sup45p and sup35p, respectively  <cit> .

members of the erf <dig> family have been identified in a number of eukaryotes and they all show a high degree of sequence similarity. determination of the crystal structure of human erf <dig> has shown that it is composed of three domains and resembles by overall shape and dimensions a trna molecule with the n-terminal and middle domains corresponding to the trna's anticodon stem and aminoacyl acceptor stem, respectively  <cit> . erf <dig> also has a complex structure and can be divided into at least two regions: a non-conserved n-terminal region and a conserved c-terminal region, showing a considerable sequence similarity to the translation elongation factor eef1a, which brings aminoacyl-trnas to the ribosomal a site. the c-terminal part  of the s. cerevisiae erf <dig> is responsible for the function of the protein in translation termination. the n-terminal region of yeast erf <dig> is non-essential for the translation termination and viability and may be further subdivided into the n-terminal  domain, which was shown to be required for maintenance of the cytoplasmically-inherited prion determinant   <cit>  and the middle  domain, which also is important for  propagation  <cit> . the nonsense suppressor phenotype of  reflects erf <dig> aggregation and functional inactivation  <cit> . thus, the n domain of erf <dig> may inhibit translation termination in s. cerevisiae in a  prion-dependent manner. however, other data have shown that this domain also affects function of a non-prion form of yeast erf <dig>  since deletion of the erf <dig> n-terminal extension  decreased nonsense codon readthrough caused by depletion of erf <dig>  <cit> . this agrees with the results showing that n-terminal extension of the schizosaccharomyces pombe erf <dig> may inhibit translation termination by blocking erf <dig> binding to erf <dig>  <cit> . however, the n-terminal region of erf <dig> from the filamentous fungus podospora anserina confers quite opposite effect on translation termination, since deletion of this protein region caused suppression of nonsense mutations  <cit> . the effects of n-terminal truncation of erf <dig> have a species-specific character probably because of the lack of sequence similarity between the n-terminal regions of erf <dig> homologs from different organisms. nevertheless, despite of structural dissimilarity, the n-terminal regions of erf <dig> from yeast and mammals are able to interact with poly+ binding protein pabp, which probably serves for coupling termination and initiation steps of translation  <cit>  and for regulation of mrna deadenylation and decay  <cit> . the n-terminal region of s. cerevisiae erf <dig> also is able to bind other proteins, such as itt1p, a protein with unknown function, and sla1p assisting in the cytoskeleton assembly  <cit> . these interactions may modulate translation termination efficiency and link translation with other cellular processes.

biochemical studies of s. cerevisiae erf <dig> are hampered by its propensity to aggregate  <cit> . this makes genetic approach preferable to investigate function of this release factor. here, we identified mutations which alter erf <dig> and make the n-terminal region of erf <dig> indispensable. the study of these mutations and their lethal interaction with the sup <dig> deletion allele, encoding the erf <dig> c-terminal domain, indicate the role of n-terminal region of this factor in non-translational function of the erf1/erf <dig> termination complex in yeast.

RESULTS
identification and characterization of mutants in which deletion of the erf <dig> nm region is lethal
the sup35-c strain yjv159-rs35c carrying the pht-sup <dig>  centromeric plasmid was mutagenized with uv irradiation and over  <dig>  of grown colonies were screened using a yeast colony color sectoring assay. among them,  <dig> were of sect- phenotype. such clones could arise due to mutations in the sup35-c gene, since it is essential  <cit> , or due to mutations in other genes. to discriminate between these possibilities, the centromeric prs315-sup35c  plasmid was introduced into the yjv159-rs35c strain carrying pht-sup <dig>  in  <dig> cases this restored sect+ phenotype indicating that mutations were within sup35-c and corresponding mutants were discarded. one mutant, which segregated white sectors very poorly, preserved its leaky sect- phenotype in the presence of the prs315-sup35c plasmid. the mutant, designated as yjv-rs35c-sl <dig>  could not grow at 37°c on ypd plate. this mutant carrying pht-sup <dig> was transformed with a genomic library based on the leu <dig> centromeric plasmid p <dig>  and two transformants able to grow at non-permissive temperature were selected. the obtained temperature resistant transformants were characterized by the frequent loss of pht-sup <dig> at permissive temperature, thus being sect+. plasmid from one transformant was isolated and partial sequencing of the cloned dna fragment has shown that it contained the sup <dig> gene. subsequent delimitation of the functional region of the isolated dna fragment indicated that sup <dig> was responsible for both temperature resistance and sect+ phenotype. transformation of this mutant with various sup45-carrying plasmids caused the same effects. thus, mutation that made the nm region of erf <dig> indispensable arose in the sup <dig> gene. transformation of the mutant yjv-rs35c-sl <dig> carrying pht-sup <dig> with the multicopy plasmid yeplac181-sup35nm encoding the erf <dig> nm region did not restore the sect+ phenotype. this indicated that expression of the entire erf <dig> protein is necessary for viability of this mutant.

the obtained sup <dig> mutation, designated as sup45-sl23ts, caused growth inhibition in the strain yjv-rs35c-sl <dig>  but was lethal in other sup45-sl23ts strains with the sup35-c allele. for example, the ura <dig> sup <dig> plasmid prs316-sup <dig> of the sup35-disrupted strain 33g-d373-rsl23-Δs <dig> carrying sup45-sl23ts could not be replaced with the leu <dig> sup35-c plasmids upon incubation on 5foa medium . it is also important that in this strain the plasmid prs316-sup <dig> also could not be replaced with the centromeric prs315-sup35mc plasmid, encoding erf <dig> which lacks only the n domain . thus, just the absence of the erf <dig> prion-forming domain was responsible for synthetic lethality.

synthetic lethality was also reproduced in the s1-r-h <dig> strain. this strain, carrying sup35-c, was disrupted for sup <dig> and contained the ura <dig> sup <dig> centromeric plasmid prg415-sup <dig>  which could not be replaced with the plasmid prs315-sup45-sl <dig> carrying the mutant sup45-sl23ts allele. in contrast, in the control strain s1-h <dig> with chromosomal wild type sup <dig>  prs315-sup45-sl <dig> could replace the resident prg415-sup <dig> plasmid. the lethal effect of combination with sup35-c was also found for another sup <dig> mutation, sup45-36ts  <cit> : the prs315-sup45- <dig> plasmid did not replace prg415-sup <dig> in the s1-r-h <dig> strain, but replaced this plasmid in the sup <dig> disruptant s1-h <dig> bearing the wild type sup <dig> gene.

the possible reason of lethality manifested by the sup <dig> mutations in combination with sup35-c is the decreased level of erf <dig>  however, the amount of erf <dig> was not affected in the sup45-36ts  <cit>  and sup45-sl23ts mutants . s. cerevisiae erf <dig> and erf <dig> interact with each other through the binding sites located at their c-termini  <cit> , though the erf <dig> n-terminal region also may be involved in this interaction  <cit> . mutations in erf <dig> breaking its interaction with erf <dig> decrease cell viability  <cit> . the observed disparity in genetic interaction of the sup45-sl23ts and sup45-36ts mutations with sup <dig> and sup35-c suggests that these mutations influence binding of erf <dig> to erf <dig>  and this effect is more pronounced when erf <dig> lacks its n-terminal region. however, the study of the ability of escherichia coli-expressed his6-erf <dig> and his6-erf1-sl <dig> immobilized on talon beads to precipitate erf <dig> and erf3c from yeast cell lysates  <cit>  did not show a noticeable effect of sup45-sl23ts mutation on the interaction of erf <dig> with both erf <dig> and erf3c .

the sup45-sl23ts and sup45-36ts mutations altered the erf <dig> n domain , increased nonsense codon readthrough and caused temperature sensitivity  <cit> . at elevated temperature corresponding mutations did not cause any noticeable increase in the levels of nonsense codon readthrough , but affected cell morphology. the sup45-36ts mutation caused defect of cytokinesis and resulted in appearance of multinucleated cells with elongated buds. the defect of cytokinesis in this mutant is related to mislocalization of the myosin light chain mlc1p and its temperature sensitivity could be suppressed by mlc1p overproduction  <cit> . in contrast, temperature sensitivity of the sup45-sl23ts mutant could not be alleviated by excess of mlc1p. cells of the sup45-sl23ts mutant were increased in size  and contained single nuclei . temperature sensitivity of the sup45-sl23ts mutant can not be explained by a defect of translation termination, since increase of the number of sup45-sl23ts copies allowed mutant to grow at 37°c, but did not decrease the levels of nonsense codon readthrough either at permissive or non-permissive temperature . it is also noteworthy that extra copies of the sup45-sl23ts allele did not restore viability of the strain yjv-rs35c-sl <dig> carrying chromosomal sup45-sl23ts and sup35-c, indicating that temperature sensitivity and synthetic lethality were caused by the impairment of different cellular processes.

mutations in sup35-c abolishing its synthetic lethality with sup45-sl23ts or sup45-36ts
mutations in sup35-c which make it compatible with sup45-sl23ts were obtained by passing the corresponding plasmid in the e. coli "mutator" strain. five independent pools of the mutagenized plasmid were obtained and used to transform the strain yjv-rs35c-sl <dig> which carried the chromosomal sup45-sl23ts and sup35-c alleles and the centromeric sup <dig> ade <dig> pht-sup <dig> plasmid. over  <dig>  of transformed cells were incubated on leucine omission medium at 37°c and  <dig> leu+ temperature resistant clones were selected. streaking of these transformants on leucine omission medium showed that  <dig> of them produced colonies with sect+ phenotype. the plasmid dna from  <dig> sect+ transformants was isolated and used for repeated transformation of the strain yjv-rs35c-sl <dig> carrying pht-sup <dig>  all leu+ transformants bearing the isolated plasmids were temperature resistant and able to lose the resident pht-sup <dig>  plasmid on medium supplemented with uracil, suggesting that they carried mutant sup35-c. it is noteworthy that, since these mutations were dominant, they restored the normal growth rate and temperature resistance of the sup45-sl23ts mutant yjv-rs35c-sl <dig> carrying the chromosomal sup35-c allele. these sup35-c mutant alleles supported viability of the sup45-sl23ts mutant 33g-d373-rsl23-Δs <dig> disrupted for sup <dig> and allowed its growth at non-permissive temperature, indicating that suppression of temperature sensitivity did not depend on genetic background.

sequencing of the mutant sup35-c alleles revealed that they had nucleotide substitutions that caused either glu- <dig> to lys , ala- <dig> to val  or ala- <dig> to val  replacements. it is noteworthy that these amino acid substitutions occurred in the positions located downstream to the erf <dig> regions implicated in gtp hydrolysis  <cit> . the corresponding alleles were respectively designated as sup35-c <dig>  sup35-c <dig> and sup35-c <dig> 

the isolated compensatory sup35-c mutations were studied for the ability to alleviate temperature sensitivity caused by the sup45-36ts mutant allele as well as to suppress its synthetic lethality with sup35-c. introduction of either one of the plasmids with the sup35-c <dig>  sup35-c <dig> or sup35-c <dig> alleles into the sup45-36ts mutant 33g-d373-r36-Δs <dig>  which was disrupted for sup <dig> and carried the prg415-sup <dig>  plasmid, allowed the loss of the resident plasmid on 5-foa-containing medium at permissive temperature , but did not cause resistance to 37°c. thus, the compensatory mutations suppressed lethality caused by the combination of either sup45-sl23ts or sup45-36ts with sup35-c, but did not suppress temperature sensitivity of sup45-36ts.

synthetic lethality between sup45-sl23ts or sup45-36ts and sup35-c is not caused by the increased levels of nonsense codon readthrough
we also tested, whether the sup35-c compensatory mutations influenced the nonsense codon readthrough caused by the sup45-sl23ts and sup45-36ts mutations. for this, the strain 33g-d373-rsl <dig> carrying the chromosomal sup45-sl23ts mutation and wild type sup <dig>  was transformed with centromeric plasmids containing either the sup35-c allele  or alleles with the sup35-c <dig>  sup35-c <dig> or sup35-c <dig> compensatory mutations along with either one of the pukc <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> plasmids. quantitative assay demonstrated that the nonsense codon readthrough was noticeably decreased only in the presence of sup35-c <dig>  this compensatory mutation also decreased the levels of nonsense readthrough in the sup45-36ts mutant 33g-d373-r <dig> carrying wild type sup <dig> but to a lesser extent than in the isogenic sup45-sl23ts mutant 33g-d373-rsl <dig> . thus, though the effect of sup35-c compensatory mutations on the levels of nonsense readthrough was not significant in most cases, they all abolished synthetic lethality, making unlikely that the increased levels of readthrough was the reason of lethal interaction between the sup45ts mutations and sup35-c allele.

to confirm this we have constructed the strains 33g-d373-rsl23-r35c and 33g-d373-r36-r35c, which carried, respectively, the sup45-sl23ts and sup45-36ts mutations and the sup35-c allele, as well as the centromeric pcm183-sup <dig> plasmid with the trp <dig> selectable marker and sup <dig> under the control of regulatable teto <dig> promoter. the synthetic lethality of sup45ts and sup35-c combination in these strains was manifested only upon the repression of wild type sup <dig> by doxycycline. as a control we used the isogenic strains 33g-d373-rsl <dig> and 33g-d373-r <dig>  which had the wild type sup <dig> gene instead of the sup35-c allele. to monitor the levels of nonsense codon readthrough upon the repression of wild type sup <dig>  all strains were transformed with either one of the pukc <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> plasmids.

since chromosomally-encoded mutant erf <dig> and its wild type counterpart encoded by the plasmid were electrophoretically indistinguishable, we could not estimate a decline in the amount of erf <dig> upon the repression of the plasmid sup <dig> in the studied strains. however, in another strain with the same teto2-sup <dig> plasmid,  <dig> h repression decreased the amount of erf <dig> to approximately 5% of its initial levels. importantly, this drop in wild type erf <dig> amount was accompanied with enrichment of cultures with dead cells up to 20% for the 33g-d373-rsl23-r35c and 33g-d373-r36-r35c strains, while the number of such cells in the 33g-d373-rsl <dig> and 33g-d373-r <dig> cultures was less than 10%. the in vivo quantification of uaa, uag, and uga nonsense readthrough has shown that its levels in the strains with synthetic lethal mutations was not higher than in the control strains . this disagrees with the assumption that the cause of synthetic lethality between sup <dig> mutations and sup35-c allele is too high levels of nonsense codon readthrough. incubation of the strain 33g-d373-rsl23-r35c carrying the teto2-sup <dig> plasmid in medium containing doxycycline did not cause any change in the polyribosome content or distribution , indicating absence of the sharp effect on translation.

discussion
here, we have demonstrated that the sup45-sl23ts mutation did not decrease the levels of erf <dig>  and sup45-sl23ts extra copies neither suppressed synthetic lethality, nor decreased nonsense codon readthrough. this indicates that both defect of translation termination and lethal interaction between sup45-sl23ts and sup35-c were not due to a shortage of erf <dig>  making improbable suggestion that these effects were due to inefficient recycling of mutant erf <dig> by erf <dig> lacking the n-terminal region. furthermore, such suggestion contradicts to our previous data indicating that the nm region of erf <dig> may negatively affect its ability to recycle erf <dig>  it was shown that shortage of erf <dig> in the strain expressing full length erf <dig> resulted in higher levels of nonsense codon readthrough than in the strain expressing erf3c  <cit> , while deletion of the erf <dig> nm region did not affect nonsense readthrough at the normal levels of erf <dig> . this suggests that the presence of erf <dig> nm region has a significant negative effect on translation termination only at the decreased erf <dig> levels. deficiency in erf <dig> should make its recycling important for translation termination and, therefore, these data agreed with the hypothesis that erf <dig> is involved in the recycling of erf <dig> and indicated that nm region of erf <dig> interferes with this process. thus, deletion of nm region should enhance the erf <dig> activity, making improbable that the reason of synthetic lethal interaction between sup35-c and sup45-sl23ts or sup45-36ts lies in inefficient translation termination. furthermore, the results of this work suggest that combination of sup35-c with either sup45-sl23ts or sup45-36ts is lethal not due to an increase of nonsense codon readthrough.

the obtained sup35-c mutations compensate for the lack of the erf <dig> n-terminal region, thus ruling out the possibility that synthetic lethality was due to a disruption of interaction with proteins that bind to this erf <dig> region, including interaction with the poly+-binding protein pabp  <cit> . this makes unlikely that synthetic lethality was caused by a disturbance in regulation of mrna decay or by alteration of translation initiation by its uncoupling from termination. the latter is also supported by the observation that synthetic lethality was not accompanied by noticeable alteration of the polyribosomal profile.

both identified sup <dig> mutations, sup45-sl23ts and sup45-36ts, that make the n-terminal region of erf <dig> indispensable, altered the n domain of erf <dig> and, furthermore, they caused substitutions of amino acids located in proximity to each other. both sup45-sl23ts and sup45-36ts increased the levels of nonsense codon readthrough and, therefore, affected translation termination. in addition, they did not allow yeast cells to grow at 37°c. earlier it was found that temperature sensitivity of the sup45-36ts mutant was not due to a defect of translation termination. inability to grow at non-permissive temperature was caused by the impairment of cytokinesis resulting from mislocalization of the erf1-binding protein, myosin light chain mlc1p  <cit> . though cytokinesis defect was not shown for the sup45-sl23ts mutant, its temperature sensitivity also was not caused by a defect in translation termination, suggesting that yeast erf <dig> may have different functions outside of translation. it is also important that the compensatory sup35-c mutations alleviated both effects of the sup45-sl23ts mutation, temperature sensitivity and increased nonsense readthrough, indicating that interaction with erf <dig> probably is important for erf <dig> not only for promoting translation termination, but also for its uncharacterized function. in contrast, interaction with erf <dig> is not required for function of erf <dig> in cytokinesis, since erf <dig> in a complex with mlc1p can not bind erf <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented here show that the effect of synthetic lethality can not be deduced from a defect of translation termination. the study of the sup35-c compensatory mutations has shown that they are able to suppress both temperature sensitivity of sup45-sl23ts and its lethal interaction with sup35-c. however, temperature sensitivity of sup45-sl23ts and its synthetic lethality with sup35-c are caused by different reasons, since increasing the copy-number of sup45-sl23ts alleviated temperature sensitivity but did not abolish synthetic lethality. therefore, these data show that the erf1/erf <dig> complex may be involved in different processes outside of translation termination.

in many yeast species the n-terminal part of the erf <dig> release factors is responsible for their prion properties  <cit> . such conservation suggests that the prion properties of yeast erf <dig> have biological significance. in this work we have shown that the prion-forming domain of erf <dig> from the yeast s. cerevisiae is important for its functioning outside of translation termination. however, this does not mean that the n-terminal extension of erf <dig> factors from other organisms plays a similar role. indeed, point mutations altering s. cerevisiae erf3c can compensate for the lack of its nm region indicating that the c domain of erf <dig> from other organisms may contain all information required for this function.
