BACKGROUND
according to the centers for disease control and prevention, in  <dig> colorectal cancer  was the third most common cancer worldwide, with an estimated  <dig>  million individuals diagnosed with crc . as a result, crc is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death, with  <dig>  individuals dying from colorectal cancer annually. risk of crc is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. a small percentage of crc  has been associated with high penetrance germline mutations, primarily contributing to the familial forms of crc. whereas for sporadic crc, genome-wide association studies  have to date identified  <dig> risk variants, each associated with a modest increase in risk of developing crc.

overall, gwas involving thousands of cases and controls have identified hundreds of genetic variants associated with cancer or other diseases  <cit> ; however, the majority of these risk alleles are associated with a modest disease risk   <cit> . one can anticipate that additional susceptibility variants will be identified through studies that have increased sample sizes, studies focusing on specific molecular sub-types, studies on other races/ethnicities, such as african americans, latinos and asians, and with the application of high-throughput sequencing technologies to fine map the association signals. however, the current understanding of the biological contributions of these risk alleles has been limited. progress has recently been made on the functional characterization of these putative causal variants through the application of tools and databases, such as expression quantitative trait loci  analysis with the genotype-tissue expression  project portal  <cit> , identification of genomic modifications involved in gene regulation by the encyclopedia of dna elements  consortium  <cit> , and the integration of high-resolution molecular characterization of multiple cancers by the cancer genome atlas   <cit>  .

in this study, we conducted a gene ontology and pathway analysis of the genes containing, or neighboring, the  <dig> gwas risk alleles for crc in order to identify potential functional mechanisms or biological pathways that could be regulated in cis by these risk alleles. we also conducted a cis-eqtl analysis to examine the relationship between the crc risk variants and gene expression for normal colon  and colorectal tumor tissue utilizing the gtex project portal and tcga data, respectively.

methods
risk variants
colorectal cancer gwas risk variants were identified in the national human genome research institute  european bioinformatics institute  catalog of published gwas   <cit> .

expression quantitative trait loci analysis
the gtex project portal  was used to identify cis-eqtls in normal transverse and sigmoid colon tissue for crc risk variants   <cit> . briefly, the cis-eqtl mapping window was defined as  <dig> megabase up- and downstream of the transcription start site. false discovery rate  was used for multiple hypothesis test correction  <cit> . significant cis-eqtls were identified based on false discovery rate fdr q-values ≤ <dig> . the effect size of the eqtl was defined as the slope of the linear regression—computed as the effect of the alternate allele relative to the reference allele.

we evaluated cis-eqtl using data from tcga which consists of gene expression and genotype data from  <dig> colon adenocarcinomas and  <dig> normal colon tissues . gene expression data was derived from an agilent 244 k custom gene expression array and genotypes were derived from affymetrix genome-wide human snp  <dig>  array. we used level  <dig> expression data , which consists of normalized signals and expression calls per gene, per sample. genotype data were obtained under approved access. gene expression levels were compared between genotypes or between normal and tumor tissues using the non-parametric wilcoxon rank sum test when comparing two factors or kruskal wallis test when comparing three factors.

bioinformatics analysis and databases
potential functional annotation of the risk alleles were identified using the haploreg version  <dig> database . the position weight matrices modeling to examine the effects of the risk allele on transcription factor binding in haploreg was collected from transfac  <cit>  and jaspar  <cit>  databases. transcriptional regulatory features such as dnase sensitivity, histone modifications, and transcription factor binding were examined in the university of california santa cruz  encyclopedia of dna elements  database . the polymorphism phenotyping v <dig>  tool was used to annotate the potential effects on protein function of coding  snps . this tool was applied to estimate the probability of the resulting amino acid substitution having a damaging effect to the protein product function. the database for annotation visualization and integrated discovery  v <dig>  was used to identify an enrichment of biological themes, particularly gene ontology terms, and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways .

RESULTS
to date,  <dig> risk variants have been associated with colorectal cancer in gwas . of these, two are coding snps, one synonymous  and one missense ,  <dig> are intronic, and  <dig> intergenic snps .table  <dig> colorectal cancer risk variants

gene ontology enrichment analysis of genes neighboring colorectal cancer risk alleles
to determine if the  <dig> crc risk variants were located in or near genes that shared similar molecular functions, or functioned in a common biological pathway, we performed gene ontology enrichment and pathway analysis of the  <dig> unique genes that were immediately neighboring up- and downstream of these variants. the kegg pathway that was significantly  enriched was pathways in cancer . this pathway was enriched  <dig> -fold, with  <dig> genes neighboring the crc risk alleles listed in this pathway: bmp <dig>  cdkn1a, bmp <dig>  lama <dig>  cdh <dig>  lamc <dig>  tcf7l <dig>  tgfb <dig>  and ctnnb <dig>  gene ontology analysis identified an enrichment for multiple biological processes , such as cell junction organization, tissue morphogenesis, regulation of smad protein phosphorylation, and odontogenesis . the gene ontology molecular function category also identified beta-catenin  and smad binding ; however, both were no longer statistically significant after correction for multiple-testing .table  <dig> gene ontology analysis - biological process

cis-eqtl analysis for colorectal cancer risk alleles
we also conducted a search for cis-eqtl  among the crc risk alleles using data for both normal sigmoid  and transverse  colon tissue from the gtex project portal  and followed up significant results in colorectal tumor tissue  from tcga. of the  <dig> risk alleles and  <dig> unique genes queried in colorectal normal and tumor tissue, we identified  <dig> intronic risk alleles  that were statistically significant cis-eqtls for the gene containing the risk variant in normal colon tissue. we also identified two intronic risk alleles  that were a statistically significant cis-eqtls for genes neighboring the intronic snps, but not for the gene containing the snp. results are described separately for each of these risk variants below and transcriptional regulatory features  <cit>  summarized in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

rs1535
the crc risk allele for rs <dig> is located at 11q <dig>  a significant cis-eqtl  for the fatty acid desaturase  <dig>  gene was identified for normal transverse colon tissue. the risk allele was associated with lower expression levels of fads <dig> compared to the reference allele, with an effect size of es =  <dig>  . interestingly, there were other multiple significant cis-eqtls for the fads <dig> gene located within and in neighboring regions outside of the fads <dig> gene for normal transverse colon tissue , with rs <dig>  not rs <dig>  being the most significant cis-eqtl for the fads <dig> gene . the two snps have an ld of r2 =  <dig>   and are located over  <dig> kb apart, with rs <dig> located in intron  <dig> and rs <dig> in intron  <dig> of the fads <dig> gene. in addition, other significant cis-eqtls for fads <dig> were identified in multiple tissue types . the most significant is observed in whole blood for rs <dig>  with a strong effect size . rs <dig> is located in the 5’-utr of the fads <dig> gene and is also a significant cis-eqtl in both normal transverse  and sigmoid  colon tissue. the protein product of the fads <dig> gene is delta- <dig> desaturase. it is a member of the fatty acid desaturase gene family and catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid .fig.  <dig> eqtl for rs <dig> in normal sigmoid and transverse colon tissue. a box plots of gene expression profiles for fads <dig> and fads <dig> expression by genotype in normal sigmoid and transverse colon tissue. reference allele  = a; alternate allele = g. b

we also queried tcga to determine if rs <dig> was also a cis-eqtl in colorectal tumor tissue. we utilized the tcga dataset of crc patients  with available genotype  and gene expression information. because the snp data available for the tcga samples did not include genotypes for rs <dig>  a proxy  in high ld  was used for this analysis. we confirmed from the gtex project portal that it was also a significant cis-eqtl for fads <dig>  in normal transverse colon tissue. we found that the proxy risk allele was associated with lower expression levels in colorectal tumor tissue compared to the reference allele .

available encode data indicate that rs <dig> is located in a region with transcriptional regulatory activity based on dnase sensitivity and chromatin states in cell lines and in colon tissue analysis . histone marks  are detected at the locus, suggesting that this locus may function as an enhancer in the colon and other related gastrointestinal tissue. in addition, based on the 25-state chromatin model, the locus is predicted to have promoter function  and transcription factor chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing  assays identified estrogen receptor alpha  binding to the locus. based on position weight matrix modeling, the risk allele is estimated to have a weaker affinity for esr <dig> binding compared to the reference allele at rs <dig> 

rs3802842
the crc risk variant, rs <dig>  is located at 11q <dig> in the intronic regions of two overlapping genes, the colorectal cancer associated  <dig> and  <dig>  genes. rs <dig> was identified in the gtex project as a significant cis-eqtl in normal transverse colon tissue for both colca <dig>  and colca <dig> . the risk allele is associated with lower expression levels of both genes in the normal transverse colon tissue compared to the reference allele, with an effect size of es = − <dig>  and es = − <dig>  for colca <dig> and colca <dig>  respectively . rs <dig> was also a significant cis-eqtl for the neighboring gene, c11orf <dig>  in normal transverse colon tissue. in addition, based on the gtex analysis, there were multiple cis-eqtls for the colca <dig> and colca <dig> genes in the normal transverse colon tissue . however, the risk allele, rs <dig>  was not the most significant eqtl for colca <dig>  colca <dig>  and c11orf <dig>  rs <dig>  a snp in high ld  with the risk allele, was the most significant cis-eqtl for colca <dig>  and therefore, may be a better candidate causal allele. the two snps are located over  <dig> kb apart, with rs <dig> located in intron  <dig> of the colca <dig> gene and rs <dig> located in intron  <dig> of the neighboring c11orf <dig> gene. similarly, rs <dig>  a snp in high ld  with the risk allele is the most significant cis-eqtl  for colca <dig> in normal transverse colon tissue. it is  <dig>  kb apart from the published risk allele and located in the 3’-utr of c11orf <dig>  based on the gtex project data for multiple tissue types , the associated effects on gene expression between rs <dig> and the three genes  in the normal transverse colon tissue was specific for this tissue, it was not observed in the other  <dig> tissue types included in the gtex project. the only other significant association for rs <dig> and expression of colca <dig> was in the tibial artery and for colca <dig> in tibial nerve tissue .fig.  <dig> eqtl for rs <dig> in normal sigmoid and transverse colon tissue. a box plots of gene expression profiles for colca <dig>  colca <dig>  and c11orf <dig>  expression by genotype in normal sigmoid and transverse colon tissue. reference allele  = c; alternate allele = a. b

we also did a cis-eqtl analysis for rs <dig> in colorectal tumor tissue using the tcga dataset. because the snp data available for the tcga samples did not include rs <dig>  a proxy snp  in high ld  with the risk variant was queried. the proxy risk allele, gtex project portal showed that it was also a significant cis-eqtl in normal transverse colon tissue for colca <dig> , colca <dig> , and c11orf <dig> . the cis-eqtl analysis with the proxy snp demonstrated similar expression patterns in the colorectal tumor tissue samples, where the risk allele associated with lower expression levels compared to the reference allele for the colca <dig>  and colca <dig>  genes .

rs <dig> is located in intronic regions of both colca <dig> and colca <dig> and based on chromatin profiling of the locus, histone marks  suggest transcriptional enhancer and promoter activity for this locus in normal tissue from the colon, as well as from other sites of the gastrointestinal tract. in addition, there were two snps  in high ld  that also displayed promoter and enhancer histone marks as well as multiple transcription factor binding ability in chip seq assays. based on chromatin marks and chip seq data, there is a strong indication that two snps - rs <dig>  located in the 5’-utr of the colca <dig> gene and rs <dig>  located in the intron of c11orf <dig> - are located in a region of transcriptional regulatory activity. in addition, both snps are also significant cis-eqtls for colca <dig>  colca <dig>  and c11orf <dig> 


rs2427308
the risk variant is located at 20q <dig>  is a significant cis-eqtl  in the normal sigmoid colon tissue for the cdk <dig> and abl enzyme substrate  <dig>  gene. the risk allele is associated with lower expression levels of cables <dig> in the normal sigmoid colon tissue compared to the reference allele, with an effect size of es =  <dig>  . the risk variant is located in intron  <dig> of the cables <dig> gene. cables <dig> has multiple cis-eqtls in normal sigmoid colon tissue and rs <dig> is not the most significant cis-eqtl for this gene. another snp  in high ld  with risk variant rs <dig>  is the most significant cis-eqtl  for cables <dig> in this tissue . the two snps are  <dig>  kb apart, with rs <dig> located in intron  <dig> of the cables <dig> gene. based on the gtex analysis of multiple tissue types , in addition to the sigmoid colon tissue, rs <dig> is a significant cis-eqtl for cables <dig> in several tissues, including the esophagus, arteries, heart, nerve, and skin . rs <dig> is also a significant cis-eqtl for the neighboring genes, lama <dig> in transformed fibroblasts and esophagus, and the rp11-157p <dig>  gene in the heart and liver. cables <dig> has a c-terminal cyclin-box-like domain and has been shown to bind to cdk <dig>  cdk <dig>  and c-abl  <cit> . cables <dig> has also been characterized as a possible tumor suppressor, functioning in both p53-mediated and p53-independent induced apoptosis pathways  <cit> .fig.  <dig> eqtl for rs <dig> in normal sigmoid and transverse colon tissue. a box plots of gene expression profiles for cables <dig> expression by genotype in normal sigmoid and transverse colon tissue. reference allele  = c; alternate allele = t. b

we also did a cis-eqtl analysis for rs <dig> in colorectal tumor tissue included in the tcga dataset. because the snp data associated with the tcga samples did not include rs <dig>  a proxy  in high ld  was queried. similar to rs <dig>  the gtex project portal showed that the proxy risk allele was also a significant cis-eqtl in normal sigmoid colon tissue. however, it was not a significant cis-eqtl in colorectal tumor tissue for the cables <dig>  gene. perhaps, the high frequency of copy number alterations at the cables <dig> gene observed in colorectal tumors contributes to the poor correlation with the cis-eqtl in tumor and normal tissue. based on gistic analysis of the tcga dataset  <cit> , 65% of the tumors had a copy number gain  and 8% had an amplification of the cables <dig> gene.

rs34245511
this risk variant is located at 12q <dig> in the intronic region of the lima <dig> gene. this risk allele was not found to be a cis-eqtl for lima <dig> in any of the tissue included in the gtex project . however, it was identified as a significant cis-eqtl  for neighboring genes, such as cers <dig>  cox <dig>  larp <dig>  atf <dig>  asic <dig> and dip2b, in other tissue types but not for normal colon tissue. tumor tissue was not evaluated because the risk variant  was not available for analysis in tcga.

rs7229639
in addition to querying for cis-eqtls for genes containing or flanking the crc risk alleles, we queried all of the  <dig> crc risk alleles for any cis-eqtls  in normal sigmoid or transverse colon tissue. of the  <dig> risk alleles examined, we found the risk allele rs <dig>  located at 18q <dig> in an intron of the smad <dig> gene, was a significant cis-eqtl for the lipase g, endothelial type  gene  located > <dig> kb downstream of rs <dig> in the normal sigmoid colon tissue. it was not a significant cis-eqtl for the smad <dig> gene in normal colon tissue or any of the tissue types  included in the gtex project. the risk allele is associated with higher expression levels of the lipg gene in normal sigmoid colon tissue.

cis-eqtl of missense risk variant, rs3184504
the missense risk allele, rs <dig>  located at 12q <dig> is a coding snp in exon  <dig> of the sh2b adaptor protein  <dig>  gene. the predicted effect of this missense mutation using the polyphen <dig> analysis tool indicates that this mutation, resulting in a trp262arg substitution, has a “benign” effect on protein function. in our analysis, the risk allele was not identified as a significant cis-eqtl for sh2b <dig> in normal colon sigmoid  or transverse  tissue. interestingly, it was a significant cis-eqtl for the aldh <dig> gene in skin tissue , indicating that the missense risk allele in the coding region of the sh2b <dig> gene has the potential to impact the expression of a neighboring gene in specific tissue types.

discussion
in this analysis, we evaluated the genes containing, or neighboring, the  <dig> crc risk variants identified by gwas to date for functional interactions through gene ontology enrichment and pathway analyses. the kegg pathway analysis revealed a six-fold enrichment for nine of the  <dig> genes queried are part of the pathways in cancer . we also queried the gtex project and tcga databases to identify cis-eqtls linking the risk alleles and expression patterns of these genes. interestingly, none of the nine genes enriched in this pathway were identified to have significant eqtls with the risk alleles in the normal colon  or colorectal tumor tissue.

we also conducted eqtl analyses for each of the crc risk variants  for functional associations with genes containing the risk alleles  or with immediate neighboring genes . for each of these risk variants, or snps in high ld with them, we utilized normal tissue expression data available through the gtex project portal and colorectal tumor tissue available through tcga to identify significant  cis-eqtls in normal colon , followed up by the characterization of their effect in colorectal tumor tissue. we identified  <dig> intronic risk alleles that were significant cis-eqtls in normal colon  tissue.

the most significant cis-eqtl that we identified was the risk allele, rs <dig>  located at 11q <dig>  it was associated with expression of colca <dig>  colca <dig>  and c11orf <dig> in normal transverse colon tissue but not in sigmoid colon or colorectal tumor tissue. this snp is located in the intronic region of the overlapping genes colca <dig> and colca <dig>  the two genes are transcribed from opposite strands, and c11orf <dig> is > <dig> kb upstream of rs <dig>  neighboring colca <dig>  this risk allele is associated with lower expression of all three regulated genes in both normal and tumor tissue. this cis-eqtl has also been previously reported by several groups for normal colon tissue  and normal rectal tissue  <cit> . in addition, immunohistochemical evaluation of protein expression profiles were recently reported for colca  <dig> and colca <dig> in normal colon tissue  <cit> . colca <dig> protein was detected in the lamina propria, extracellularly between epithelial cells, and in immune cells . colca <dig> is expressed in both immune and epithelial cells. peltekova et al. observed lower levels of colca <dig> and colca <dig> protein expression in colon tissue from individuals homozygous for the risk allele, consistent with our cis-eqtl results, supporting the observation that the risk allele is associated with lower expression levels of colca <dig> and colca <dig>  <cit> .

in addition to the risk allele , multiple snps in high ld are also significant cis-eqtls for the three genes   and, as previously reported by closa et al.  <dig>  <cit> , our analysis indicated that rs <dig> was not the most significant cis-eqtl in the region. in fact, rs <dig>  a snp in high ld  with the risk allele had a stronger association with colca <dig> expression and equivalent associations with colca <dig> and c11orf <dig> expression compared to rs <dig>  the rs <dig> locus also demonstrated histone modification marks in normal colon tissue, suggesting that the locus has transcriptional enhancer and promoter activity  <cit> . however, in addition to the histone marks at the rs <dig> locus,  <dig> transcription factors  were shown to be capable of binding to this locus based on chip-seq experiments. another snp in high ld  with rs <dig>  and located in the 5’-utr of the colca <dig> gene, rs <dig>  also demonstrates a high likelihood of transcriptional regulatory activity, with histone marks and  <dig> transcription factors  capable of binding to the locus and is also a significant cis-eqtl  for colca <dig> in the normal transverse colon tissue. these data suggest that either, or both, of these two snps could be the functional snp regulating expression of the three genes, primarily colca <dig>  in addition, of the  <dig> tissue types analyzed in the gtex project, these significant cis-eqtls observed in the normal transverse colon tissue had a strong expression association predominantly in colon tissue and not in the other tissue types .

the colca <dig> and colca <dig> genes are a highly conserved, with multiple orthologs for both genes -- with  <dig> orthologs for colca <dig>  from coelacanths and xenopus to primates and  <dig> orthologs for colca <dig>  from bats to primates. however, their function has not yet been well characterized. since lower expression levels of colca <dig> and colca <dig> is associated with the risk allele  and lower expression levels of colca <dig> and colca <dig> were observed in colorectal tumors versus normal tissue . it is plausible that colca <dig> and colca <dig> both function as a tumor suppressor gene, potentially by mediating immune cell function in the colon tissue.

the intronic risk allele, rs <dig> was identified as a significant cis-eqtl for the fads <dig> gene in normal transverse colon tissue  and although the association for normal sigmoid colon tissue was not statistically significant , the strong p-value  suggests that rs <dig> may also be a cis-eqtl for sigmoid colon tissue, with lower levels of fads <dig> gene expression being associated with the risk allele. this cis-eqtl was also observed in colorectal tumor tissue by zhang et al.  <cit> . we also observed a strong indication for association between rs <dig> with fads <dig> expression  in colorectal tumor tissue; however this association did not meet the significance cut-off of fdr ≤  <dig>  after multiple text correction. interestingly, rs <dig> is also a methylation-qtl  in lymphocytes: its genotypes, or genotypes at proxy snps rs <dig> , rs <dig>  and rs <dig> , are associated with methylation levels at various cpg sites annotated to fads <dig>  spanning its promoter region, first exon and body region  <cit> . notably, the methylation levels at cg <dig>  located within 1500 bp of fads2’s transcription start site, increase with the number of risk alleles  <cit> , consistent with the corresponding reduction in gene expression that we observed. fads <dig>  and a gene family member, fads <dig>  are rate-limiting enzymes that function in the biosynthesis pathway for pufa conversion and are recognized as the main determinants of pufa levels. rs <dig> was not identified as a statistically significant cis-eqtl for fads <dig> in normal transverse or sigmoid colon tissue; however, the strong p-value  suggests that rs <dig> may also be a cis-eqtl for fads <dig> in normal sigmoid colon tissue. interestingly, fads <dig> gene expression pattern associated with the risk allele is in the opposite direction compared to fads <dig>  i.e. higher levels of fads <dig> expression is associated with the risk allele . in addition, rs <dig> demonstrates very poor association with fads <dig> expression in the transverse colon tissue , the tissue type that had significant association with rs <dig> and fads <dig>  these cis-eqtl results suggest that the effects of the rs <dig> on fads <dig> and fads <dig> expression differ in the two colon subsites, with lower fads <dig> and higher fads <dig> expression levels associated with the risk allele in normal sigmoid colon tissue and robust  fads <dig> and minimal change in fads <dig> expression in the transverse colon . these associated effects on gene expression could potentially result in a disruption to the relative levels of the byproducts along the long-chain pufa biosynthesis pathway mediated by delta- <dig> and delta- <dig> desaturase. pufas play an important role in multiple biological systems, including the maintenance of cellular membrane lipid-bilayer integrity signaling events . alterations to the activity of the fads <dig> and fads <dig> gene products, delta- <dig> and delta- <dig> desaturase, respectively, has been associated with several diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, and cancer  . our analysis of fads <dig> gene expression in colorectal tumor versus normal tissue indicate that fads <dig> is upregulated in colorectal tumors compared to normal tissue  , supporting the observation that disruption of fads <dig> expression may also have an important role in crc.

there are numerous  significant cis-eqtls for fads <dig> in both normal transverse and sigmoid colon tissue, some cis-eqtls are located in the fads <dig> gene and others in neighboring genes . the most significant cis-eqtl for fads <dig> in transverse colon tissue was not rs <dig>  it was rs <dig>  which is in intron  <dig> of the fads <dig> gene. these two snps have a modest linkage . the linkage disequilibrium structure is quite variable across the three major racial populations at this locus . interestingly, the maf for rs <dig> in europeans is  <dig> ,  <dig>  for east asians, and  <dig>  in africans, whereas, the maf for rs <dig>  is  <dig>  for europeans, < <dig>  for east asians, and  <dig>  for africans , and the association with rs <dig> and crc was initially identified in an east asian population. if rs <dig> is identified as the functional snp, it may have implications on the role played by fads <dig> in affecting risk of crc among asians and africans compared to europeans.

in addition to crc, the missense risk allele, rs <dig>  has been identified as a risk variant for multiple diseases  . this snp was also identified as one of three pleiotropic loci with a significant association with colorectal, lung, and breast cancers  <cit> . rs <dig> is a missense snp, resulting in a tryptophan to arginine substitution at position  <dig>  the effects of this missense mutation are predicted to be benign to protein function. in addition, in our cis-eqtl analysis in normal and colorectal tumor tissue, we did not identify rs <dig> as a cis-eqtl for sh2b <dig> in colon tissue or any of the other  <dig> tissue types included in the gtex project, or in colorectal tumor tissue in tcga. however, in a separate study, westra hj et al. identified rs <dig> as a cis-eqtl for sh2b <dig> and as a trans-eqtl for  <dig> unique genes involved in toll-like receptor and interferon-Ɣ response signaling in whole blood samples  <cit> . since these cis- and trans-eqtl genes are linked to immune cell activity, the biological effects of rs <dig> could be to mediate tumorigenesis  through inflammation  <cit> .

the crc risk variant, rs <dig>  located in an intron of the smad <dig> gene was a significant cis-eqtl for lipg gene , but not for smad <dig> , in the normal sigmoid colon tissue. the risk allele is associated with higher expression levels of the lipg gene in normal sigmoid colon tissue. the lipg gene encodes for a phospholipase involved in lipoprotein metabolism, particularly high-density lipoprotein  and vascular biology  <cit> . a recent report by slebe et al. demonstrated that the increased catalytic activity of lipg is required for breast cancer cell growth and proliferation because it is responsible for hydrolyzing extracellular phospholipids, from hdl, which are then incorporated into intracellular lipids to provide the necessary lipid precursors for breast cancer cells  <cit> . similarly, it is possible that the risk allele is associated with crc by increasing levels of lipg in colorectal tumor tissue to supply lipid precursors during tumorigenesis.

our biological pathway and cis-eqtl analysis with the most recent list of crc risk variants and genes in proximity to these variants, provide further insight into the potential functional relationship between the risk alleles and gene expression. however, there were limitations with our findings as regulation of gene expression is tissue and context specific, involving multiple levels of coordinated regulatory mechanisms, and the available data may have limitations in capturing these events. we utilized data from the gtex project portal, providing us the opportunity to examine the relationship between genotype and gene expression of  <dig> different tissue types from a total of  <dig> samples. however, the gtex project only included tissue from the normal sigmoid and transverse colon. therefore cis-eqtl analysis could only be performed for tissue from these colon subsites. since only 65% of crc originate from these two sites   <cit> , we may have missed identification of cis-eqtls for tissue in other regions of the colon and rectum that crc can originate in. we also did not identify statistically significant cis-eqtl  in the colorectal tumor tissue dataset despite a similar sample size used in the normal colon tissue analysis. we also did not observe significant cis-eqtls for the three crc risk variants  that we identified in a previous report  <cit> , perhaps due to limited sample size in the earlier report and tumor heterogeneity adding to the limitations to identify statistically significant cis-eqtl in tumor tissue. copy number alterations at the loci of investigation in the tumor tissue may also complicate cis-eqtl identification and interpretation. this study has identified potential functional snps which contribute to crc risk and tumor biology, however, additional experimental validation will be needed to confirm the role of these snps and genes in crc.

CONCLUSIONS
our biological pathway and cis-eqtl analysis based on the most recent list of crc risk variants and proximal genes provide further insight into the potential functional regulatory role for risk alleles and gene expression. the data reaffirm the potential to identify an enrichment for biological processes and candidate causal genes based on expression profiles correlated with genetic risk alleles of colorectal cancer, however, the identification of these significant cis-eqtls is context and tissue specific.
