BACKGROUND
the mediterranean basin was placed among  <dig> world biodiversity ‘hotspots for conservation priority’ based on high levels of endemism and rapid loss of natural areas  <cit> . humans began transforming mediterranean ecosystems > <dig>  years ago  <cit> , such that today, only  <dig> % of primary vegetation remains unaltered in the region  <cit> . despite these long-standing impacts, the mediterranean continues to be home to a diverse flora and fauna.

several factors  promoted development of this diversity at different temporal and geographic scales, such as the messinian salinity crisis and the onset of a mediterranean-type climate ~ <dig>  ma  <cit> . glaciations during the pleistocene  also played a role in shaping current diversity patterns  <cit> : climatic fluctuations during this period caused regional extinctions  <cit>  and promoted range shifts and diversification via allopatric speciation . the three major southern mediterranean peninsulas  were long thought to have served as major refugia for european flora and fauna during pleistocene glaciations  <cit> , but recent studies have challenged this paradigm as too simplistic to explain observed patterns  <cit> . as a consequence, some authors have argued for refugia within refugia  <cit>  or multiple northern refugia .

different approaches have been used to delimit glacial refugia in the mediterranean. traditionally, paleoecological evidence  <cit>  and concentrations of endemic taxa  <cit>  served as primary evidence, but more recently, comparative phylogeographic studies have been used to delineate “phylogeographic hotspots”, or areas with unique genetic diversity  <cit> , while others have used ecological niche models  in conjunction with paleoclimate simulations . the latter methodology projects environmental requirements of species onto past conditions, thus offering an approach that is independent and complementary  <cit> . each approach has drawbacks and merits, but identifying regions using multiple approaches offers increased confidence  <cit> . although other studies have successfully integrated phylogeographic and enm approaches to uncover putative refugial areas  <cit> , few have treated the entire mediterranean basin  <cit> , and none have considered the added complexity of a human commensal.

two loxosceles spider species coexist in the mediterranean: l. rufescens  and the tunisian l. mrazig ribera and planas  <dig>  loxosceles rufescens originated in the mediterranean  <cit>  but has been transported worldwide by humans  <cit> . duncan et al.  <cit>  documented diverse genetic lineages among individuals morphologically consistent with l. rufescens, suggesting cryptic speciation. the morphological simplicity within loxosceles makes traditional species delimitation “singularly difficult” , so genetically-based methodologies are key to illuminating the evolutionary history of this group. in addition, relationships between l. rufescens lineages are not predictable by geographic location  <cit> , which contrasts with the high spatial structure of populations in other loxosceles species  <cit> . therefore, loxosceles rufescens is an ideal model to unravel the role of climatic changes and human impacts on the evolutionary history of mediterranean species.

in this contribution, we examine mtdna diversity within l. rufescens, and elucidate evolutionary processes that promoted this diversity via a combination of phylogeographic and enm approaches. our working hypothesis is that current mtdna diversity was generated allopatrically in glacial refugia across the mediterranean, and that l. rufescens biogeography was since obfuscated by human activity. this hypothesis offers three opportunities for testing:  divergence times should coincide with periods of repeated glaciations ,  multiple putative refugia should have existed to provide areas of origin for distinct evolutionary lineages, and  widespread lineages should show no spatial structure within the mediterranean basin.

methods
taxonomic sampling
we sampled l. rufescens populations across the mediterranean basin to replicate and complement previous sampling  <cit>  and to increase the likelihood of discovering new lineages. in all,  <dig> localities were sampled across eight countries . from these localities,  <dig> individuals were sequenced and included in our analyses.figure  <dig> 
map of sampling localities. green circles represent localities used in enm analyses; pink stars indicate additional sampled localities used in the phylogenetic analyses.



molecular data
we included at least one individual from each locality in molecular analyses. total genomic dna was extracted using speedtools tissue dna extraction kit  following manufacturer’s protocols. we amplified a portion of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit i  using linf and gayar primers  <cit> , producing 1016-bp fragments; we used different combinations of c1-j- <dig>  c1-j- <dig>  <cit>  and c1-n- <dig>  <cit>  internal primers when the first set failed. pcr reactions were conducted at a final volume of 25 μl using either taq polymerase  or biotools pfu dna polymerase . pcr products were cycle-sequenced in both directions using the same pcr primers and the bigdye terminator v. <dig>  cycle sequencing kit . sequences were derived from these products in an abi  <dig> automated sequencer at the serveis científico-tècnics of the universitat de barcelona and in macrogen, inc. . raw sequences were edited and assembled with geneious v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . to avoid amplification of pseudogenes reported by duncan et al.  <cit>  for loxosceles cox <dig>  we mostly used loxosceles-specific primers; we also translated sequences into amino-acids, and checked for stop-codons.

sequences were aligned unambiguously in geneious using clustalw  <cit>  with default parameters. we partitioned data by codon position and explored best partitioning schemes and substitution models simultaneously using partitionfinder v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  under a bayesian information criterion for the entire matrix. these steps were conducted independently for individuals employed in delimitation analyses, and for the reduced set used in dating analyses.

phylogenetic analyses
we used maximum likelihood  and bayesian inference  to infer phylogenetic relationships from a dataset containing one representative of each cox <dig> haplotype. ml analyses were conducted in raxml v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  with the aid of the graphical front-end raxml-gui v. <dig>   <cit> . we applied a rapid hill-climbing search algorithm, and conducted  <dig> non-parametric bootstrap replicates. bi analyses were conducted in mrbayes v. <dig>   <cit>  with two independent runs of two million generations with four markov chains , sampling every  <dig> generations. we checked convergence of chains visually in tracer v. <dig>   <cit>  until effective sample sizes  were above  <dig>  and the average standard deviations of split frequencies  of the two runs were below  <dig> . the first 25% of trees in each run were discarded as burn-in, and a majority-rule consensus tree was generated from remaining trees. bi trees were also obtained with beast v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  using a coalescent tree prior with a constant population size and a relaxed lognormal clock . two independent runs of  <dig> million generations  were used for each analysis. we assessed convergence and correct mixing of chains by inspecting the trace plots and ensuring ees >  <dig> in tracer. the two runs were combined using logcombiner and treeanotator  <cit>  after removing a 10% burn-in of the samples. position of the root of the tree was estimated implicitly in beast  <cit>  and used for rooting raxml and mrbayes trees.

genetic p-distances between and within lineages  were calculated using mega <dig>  <cit> . to study demographic history , we applied two neutrality tests: fu’s fs  <cit>  and r <dig>  <cit>  in dnasp v. <dig>   <cit> . we assessed statistical significance and confidence intervals using coalescence simulations in dnasp with  <dig> replicates and default parameters. we excluded six sequences from the a <dig> lineage that lacked the data for the 3' or 5' ends.

molecular delimitation analyses
morphological traits provide few means of distinguishing lineages of l. rufescens, but genetic distances between lineages are high and different lineages are often sympatric at micro-scales ; consequently, assignment of individuals to lineages is not a simple function of geographic location. to account for this, we used two methodologies for objective delimitation of evolutionary lineages:  a general mixed yule coalescent model , and  phylogenetic network estimation using statistical parsimony . although these methodologies have been successful at circumscribing species and often yield results congruent with alternative species delimitation methods , their utility depends on different factors , with results tending perhaps towards overestimation of species numbers  <cit> .

gmyc
gmyc is a species delimitation method that provides an objective way to delimit genetic clusters  <cit> . the method was developed to identify putative species in poorly-known groups based on single molecular markers  <cit> . the model seeks transition points  between inter-specific relationships and intra-specific coalescent events, and subsequently tests the likelihood of the model against a null model that assumes a single branching process for the entire tree  <cit> . since gmyc requires identical sequences to be removed  <cit> , we included one representative of each haplotype. because gmyc is sensitive to relative branch lengths and topology of the ultrametric tree  <cit> , we explored effects of alternative input trees obtained from ml using raxml, and bi using mrbayes and beast, as described below.

we generated a ml tree using raxml  <cit> , as outlined above. we converted this result to an ultrametric tree using pathd <dig>  <cit> , arbitrarily fixing the root at  <dig> units. bayesian trees were derived using mrbayes  <cit> , with two independent runs of  <dig> million generations with four markov chains each , sampling every  <dig> generations with a coalescent clock prior. the clock rate was arbitrarily fixed to one, and we used a lognormal distribution as a prior for population size. we checked for chain convergence as described above. the ultrametric tree was imported into r  <cit>  and made fully dichotomous with the multi2di function in the ape package v. <dig>   <cit> . the ultrametric bayesian tree from beast was obtained as outlined above.

tcs
separate haplotype networks in statistical parsimony analyses might provide a useful and objective method to delimit individuals into evolutionary significant units  <cit> . networks delimited using a 95% parsimony connection limit, i.e. the probability that two dna sequences share a parsimonious relationship without multiple substitutions underlying any single nucleotide difference  <cit> , generally correspond to single species . we obtained statistical parsimony networks in tcs v. <dig>   <cit>  using our complete dataset , applying 95% and 99% connection limits, and treating gaps as missing data.

patterns of genetic diversity
we investigated how mtdna diversity is distributed across geography within l. rufescens following  <cit> ; this methodology is of particular use when localities have unequal sample sizes. diversity statistics are computed by considering samples located within a perimeter around a grid point. we set grid points every 100 km in latitude and longitude, and computations were assessed across random sets of five individuals, bootstrapping  <dig> times. we calculated three diversity indices, total diversity , haplotype richness , and rarity index   <cit> , in r  <cit>  using custom scripts provided by n. arrigo. high genetic diversity combined with rare haplotypes are characteristics of populations with a long in situ history, so identification of this pattern may indicate regions of origin for the different lineages  <cit> . we explored effects of different parameters on diversity indices, varying grid point distances 50–450 km, and numbers of individuals per analysis 3– <dig> 

we analyzed the geographic structure of each lineage using a mantel test implemented in the isolation by distance web service v. <dig>   <cit> . geographic distances among localities were calculated using the geographic distance matrix generator v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , and genetic p-distances between localities were calculated in mega. we performed mantel tests with  <dig> permutations to assess significance of correlations between genetic distances and log-transformed geographic distances. we excluded lineages b <dig> and b <dig> from mantel tests owing to low numbers of localities . lineages a <dig> to a <dig> were pooled for the analyses , and remaining lineages were assessed independently.

dating analysis
since we lacked reliable calibration points within the l. rufescens lineage, we explored two divergent rates. first, we used a loxosceles-specific molecular rate obtained using fossil and island ages as calibration points  <cit> . second, we applied the substitution rate obtained for the same mtdna gene in a closely-related spider family . as the two rates are fairly divergent, we suspect that actual divergence times for l. rufescens fall somewhere between these end points. rates were incorporated as priors under a normal distribution with mean  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively. dating analyses were conducted in beast  <cit> , using an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock  <cit>  and a yule tree prior. one representative of each lineage was included in analyses, and we used two independent runs of  <dig> million generations, sampling every 1000th generation, for each analysis. we assessed convergence and correct mixing of chains by inspecting trace plots and ensuring ees >  <dig> in tracer. runs were combined using logcombiner and treeanotator, after removing a 10% burn-in.

ecological niche modeling 
study area
niche models for l. rufescens were calibrated within a region that we hypothesized was ‘sampled’ by the species over its relevant history; in other words, a region the species had been able to deem suitable/unsuitable , intersected with regions that were sampled as part of this study  <cit> . to calculate m, we buffered l. rufescens records by the longest distance from the sea to a documented locality , which provided an estimate of the dispersal capability of the species. we excluded areas that we were unable to sample, or where closely-related species occur . these steps left a calibration area comprising morocco, the iberian peninsula, balearic islands, sardinia, sicily, continental italy, greece and adjacent islands, crete, and tunisia. after model calibration in this area, we projected results to the entirety of the mediterranean basin, within a bounding rectangle of  <dig> – <dig> ° latitude and − <dig> – <dig> ° longitude .

climate data
we obtained climate data from eight coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation model  simulations: community climate system model , centre national de recherches météorologiques , consortium for small-scale modelling , goddard institute for space studies , institute pierre simon laplace , model for interdisciplinary research on climate , max-planck institut für meterologie , and meteorological research institute . these aogcms were derived from the multi-model ensemble in the coupled model intercomparison project phase  <dig>   <cit>  and the paleoclimate modelling intercomparison project phase  <dig>   <cit> ; more details about the climate models are provided in additional file  <dig> and in taylor et al.  <cit> .

we downloaded monthly simulation outputs for annual precipitation and mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures from the pre-industrial experiment, which characterized current climatic conditions. past conditions were characterized using paleoclimate simulations for the mid-holocene  and last glacial maximum  from each aogcm, with the exception of giss and cosmos, which lacked mid-holocene outputs. to produce climate scenarios at resolutions relevant to the spatial scale of species’ distributions, we downscaled climate layers to  <dig> ° resolution using a standard change-factor approach  <cit> :  for each aogcm, we computed the difference between the past  and current simulations , and this difference  and the current climate were interpolated to  <dig> ° spatial resolution using kriging;  these differences were added to the interpolated current climate to obtain interpolated past conditions. we used absolute differences for temperatures and relative differences for precipitation; see  <cit>  for further details. this procedure maintains higher-resolution topography in downscaled climates and ensures coherency of climatic patterns over time  <cit> . from these downscaled climatic scenarios, we computed  <dig> so-called ‘bioclimate’ variables  <cit> , but we excluded mean temperature of the wettest and driest quarters, and precipitation of the warmest and coldest quarters, owing to the spatial artifacts that emerge in these four variables.

for each aogcm, we performed a principal components analysis in r  <cit>  on the  <dig> bioclimatic variables in the calibration area to create new axes that summarized variation in fewer, independent dimensions, and to reduce co-linearity among variables. we retained those principal components that explained cumulatively 99% of the overall variance in the dataset  for model calibration. these principal components were used to calculate corresponding composite variables for mid-holocene and lgm conditions. the pca structure for current conditions was enforced for the past conditions using a script in r  <cit>  written by a. lira and n. barve .

occurrence data
we used a subset  of occurrence data associated with samples employed in the genetic analyses. these localities were obtained directly from fieldwork in natural areas by ep and others , and have precise latitude/longitude coordinates derived from gps measurements. to consider the potential biasing effects introduced by spatial autocorrelation, such that spatially-clumped points would over-represent certain environments, we calculated spatial lags in environmental data using geostatistical analyst in arcmap v. <dig> , and subsampled the records to create  <dig> replicate datasets using a script in r  <cit>  written by n. barve . based on lag calculations, we enforced a minimum distance of 50 km between localities. subsampling occurrence data to account for environmental lag ensures that suitable conditions are evenly weighted during model calibration. each subset included 62– <dig> occurrence records.

modeling algorithm
enms were generated using maxent v. <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , which can be monitored for extrapolation errors when projecting to past climates  <cit> . maxent minimizes the relative entropy between two probability densities—one from the distributional data and one from the background or study area—defined in covariate space  <cit> . we used default parameters, but specified  <dig> bootstrap replicates per occurrence dataset and a minimum training presence threshold rule to avoid omission error. we took the median of the  <dig> runs per occurrence dataset multiplied by  <dig>  and converted to integer grids in arcmap. these grids were used to calculate the median of the  <dig> subsets for each aogcm. the resulting models were converted to binary grids based on all  <dig> localities using a minimum training present approach  <cit> . use of multiple aogcms  <cit>  provides a broader estimate of suitable conditions for l. rufescens, but we acknowledge that ensemble-modeling approaches may shed additional light on model-dependent results .

when transferring models temporally or spatially, conditions outside the range of climatic values in the calibration region  may be encountered, leading to situations of extrapolation. to identify these regions, we used a script in r  <cit>  written by n. barve  <cit>  to create mobility oriented parity  maps  <cit> . areas identified as both suitable and extrapolative were removed from analyses to avoid interpreting results outside of known climatic response conditions for l. rufescens.

model evaluation
to evaluate the predictive power of the models, we partitioned two of the replicate occurrence datasets at random: half of the data was used in model calibration, and the other half for model testing via partial receiver operator characteristic  approaches  <cit> . partial roc avoids many of the problems associated with traditional roc analyses, such as equal weighting of omission and commission errors, and consideration of model thresholds that yield irrelevant predictions. these tests were run using a visual basic routine developed by n. barve  <cit> , with an expected error rate of e = 1%  <cit> . we performed  <dig> bootstrap iterations by resampling 50% of test points with replacement.

identifying refugial areas
we identified possible refugia as areas that remained continuously suitable from the lgm to the present. because glaciations were common throughout the pleistocene, with glacial and interglacial conditions recurring in nearly-regular cycles with similar amplitudes   <cit> , we assume that the three time slices used here  capture, at least to some degree, the key climatic conditions across the entire pleistocene  <cit> . we acknowledge, however, that these reconstructions are merely broad estimates of potential refugial conditions for l. rufescens and lack constraining data for the earlier half of the epoch.

we identified refugia using two approaches: approach one  required aogcms to agree on suitable area for each time slice, applying four different thresholds . this resulted in four different suitability maps for the lgm, the mid-holocene, and the present-day. the intersection of the three time slices was taken as the final refugial area, which created four different possible refugial scenarios . the second approach  calculated refugial area across the three time slices for each individual aogcm ; in other words, the intersection of suitable area was taken across the three time slices  for each aogcm independently. from the individual aogcm maps of refugial areas, we applied the threshold criteria of m <dig> to identify consensus regions . in effect, these two methods explored sensitivity to threshold choice, and resulted in eight putative refugial maps. we repeated the two methods without cosmos and ipsl, as these aogcms often exhibit anomalous climatic patterns compared to other aogcms. using enm to identify putative refugia can elucidate potential divergence mechanisms. considerable caution, however, should be exercised in interpreting such analyses, particularly in light of the spatial grain of these data: coarse-resolution climate data cannot detect fine-scale phenomena .figure  <dig> 
refugium delimitation methods. refugial areas were identified as the intersection of the three time slices. method  <dig> sought consensus among the eight aogcms in each time slice by requiring at least  one to agree,  4/ <dig> to agree,  6/ <dig> to agree and  all  <dig> to agree. method  <dig> sought the intersection of the three time slices for each aogcm independently, subsequently requiring the aogcms to agree in the same fashion as m1: at least  one to agree,  4/ <dig> to agree,  6/ <dig> to agree and   <dig> to agree .



RESULTS
phylogenetic analyses
new sequences obtained during this study were deposited in genbank with accession numbers kj <dig> - kj <dig> ; additional sequences were downloaded from genbank . in total,  <dig> sequences were used, containing  <dig> different haplotypes. partitionfinder suggested a non-partitioned codon scheme with a hky + g substitution model as the best fit for these data under the bayesian information criterion; we used this partition scheme and substitution model in all phylogenetic analyses except raxml, where only a gtr + g model was available.

phylogenetic results were nearly identical between bi and ml approaches . in both cases, l. rufescens was split in two main clades: a and b . clade a included six well-supported lineages . four lineages were composed exclusively of individuals from morocco . a <dig> placed as sister to a well-supported clade comprising a2-a6; the clade composed of a2-a <dig> placed as sister to a clade composed of a5-a <dig>  a <dig> included individuals from two iberian peninsula populations, and a <dig> included individuals from across the mediterranean.figure  <dig>

molecular delimitation analyses
we used three methods to obtain the ultrametric trees required for gmyc analyses . in all three cases, the likelihood ratio test of the yule model was significantly better than the null hypothesis . clusters identified  were mostly congruent across methods; in all three, seven clusters were delimited. slight differences between approaches appeared in terms of detecting singletons: in total, we recovered  <dig> entities  using the ultrametric tree obtained with beast , while the remaining two analyses delimited  <dig> entities . differences occurred in lineages b <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig>  wherein gmyc analyses using the beast tree split each of these lineages into two clusters .

tcs results varied depending on the connection limit : a 95% connection limit resulted in fewer independent networks compared to a 99% limit. in the former case, the maximum number of calculated steps was  <dig>  forming seven independent networks, and in the latter case, the maximum number of calculated steps was five, with  <dig> independent networks. the higher connection limit mirrored the gmyc results. we found two main patterns in the haplotype networks:  several lineages composed of individuals restricted to one or a few localities that harbor only one or a few haplotypes, and conversely,  single haplotypes present in individuals from across the mediterranean basin, with closely related haplotypes forming a star-like network .figure  <dig> 
distribution map and haplotype network for each lineage. colors on haplotype networks correspond to colored areas on the maps to the left . haplotype networks are not to the same scale among lineages. each circle represents one haplotype, and colors correspond to frequencies of region of origin for the haplotype . note the two contrasting phylogeographic patterns, with lineages a <dig> to a <dig> restricted to one or a few well-structured populations, whereas the lineages distributed across the mediterranean basin generally lack geographic structure, which is likely a consequence of human-mediated dispersal.



patterns of genetic diversity
analyses were conducted across the entire dataset and within lineages with wide distributions . analyses across all lineages lacked clear geographic patterns for total diversity  and haplotype richness ; however, they exhibited higher values for the rarity index  in southern morocco. analyses of individual lineages showed clear geographic patterns for lineage b <dig> and b <dig>  wherein higher values for all diversity statistics were obtained in the iberian peninsula and balearic islands, respectively. lineages a <dig> and b <dig> showed no clear geographic pattern, with the highest values in various isolated regions. different parametrizations for this test produced similar patterns . that is, similar results were obtained when the number of individuals was reduced to three , except within lineage b <dig>  where high values for all statistics characterized the region around greece. the mantel test showed weak correlations between genetic and geographic distance matrices for lineages a <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  and b <dig> , with tests not significant except for lineage b <dig> . conversely, when lineages a1-a <dig> were pooled, we obtained a stronger and significant correlation , suggesting that they are geographically structured.table  <dig>

dating analyses
divergence time estimates differed depending on the rate used in calibration . both analyses, however, dated major diversification events to the period of pleistocene glaciations. the estimated split between the two main clades  was dated at  <dig>  ma  using the loxosceles-specific rate, and at  <dig>  ma  with the parachtes rate.

niche models
present
models from individual aogcms were predictive of independent suites of occurrence points, with all models statistically significant in partial roc tests . predictions were consistent across aogcms , with suitable areas identified in the southern iberian peninsula, italy, greece, western turkey, northern africa, and various mediterranean islands. minor differences were noted among models; for example, less suitable area was identified in turkey under miroc and mri. regions environmentally outside those represented within m  were also consistent across aogcms, covering desert areas  and some regions around the black sea; these regions were not considered in our analyses.

paleoprojections
most regions identified as suitable in the present were also identified as suitable during the mid-holocene . mop results were similar to those in the present, with one exception: although ipsl identified potential distributions congruent with those in other aogcms, mop analyses indicated most of these regions were environmentally novel. a similar situation occurred with the lgm projection for miroc. refugial area delimitation was not affected by removal of these two models with odd results.

compared to present and mid-holocene projections, lgm potential distributions shifted southward. the main mediterranean peninsulas  retained suitable conditions, although reduced in extent, but extensive regions of the sahara, which were largely unsuitable in the present and mid-holocene, were identified as suitable during the lgm under most aogcms. regions environmentally outside those represented within m occurred across broad swaths of the northern and southeastern portions of our study area.

identifying refugial areas
results from individual aogcms were similar, with the exception of ipsl. because ipsl uses a different vegetation model from other aogcms , we ran refugial delimitation analyses with and without ipsl. putative refugia were congruent across the two methodologies and with and without ipsl . depending on the level of stringency enforced for aogcm agreement, 4– <dig> major, independent, and isolated refugia were identified . when less stringent agreement thresholds were applied , the entire mediterranean rim was identified as refugial, except for the northern and eastern coast of the adriatic sea and gulf of genoa. with intermediate levels of stringency , most refugia were situated in the western mediterranean, primarily morocco, algeria, and parts of the iberian peninsula . the balearic islands, especially mallorca, were identified as refugial, even under the most stringent criteria , and some parts of sicily were recovered under most scenarios . unlike the western mediterranean, few parts of the eastern half of the mediterranean were identified as refugial. for example, only some areas of the peloponnese  were recovered consistently as putative refugia; broad areas of anatolia and the levant coast were recovered as refugial only under the least stringent aogcm agreement levels.figure  <dig> 
refugial maps developed via two delimitation methods. maps a, b, c and d were obtained with method  <dig>  and maps e, f, g and h were obtained using method  <dig>  as described in figure  <dig> 



discussion
genetic diversity and biogeography
we document high mtdna genetic diversity in l. rufescens across the mediterranean basin, as reported previously by duncan et al.  <cit> , underscoring the importance of broad sampling efforts for accurate representation of diversity patterns. most of the delimitation methods recover  <dig> distinct evolutionary lineages , but molecular delimitation analyses, particularly those using only one line of evidence , can be prone to over-delimitation  <cit> . thus, identified lineages should be taken as a basis for further studies of taxonomic status using integrative approaches based on morphology and variable nuclear markers  <cit> , and the phylogeographic patterns uncovered herein merit reexamination with additional nuclear data. nevertheless, even without further analyses, the existence of such divergent mitochondrial lineages deserves attention, and our main aim was to understand the factors promoting this diversity.

genetic diversity is not distributed uniformly among lineages within l. rufescens, and is, in fact, highly heterogeneous . broadly, we find two contrasting phylogeographic patterns: the mountainous region of morocco harbors several lineages with well-structured populations, whereas lineages distributed across the broader mediterranean basin generally lack geographic structure.

four lineages  are distributed along the western slopes of the atlas mountains , including individuals from a <dig> referred to as the “asni clade” by duncan et al.  <cit> . although lineages a1-a <dig> live in close proximity , they exhibit striking genetic divergence . the atlas mountain region shows the highest rarity index values in analyses considering all lineages . this pattern of deep genetic divergence and haplotype differentiation among populations in close proximity may be explained by long-term presence of this species in the region and low dispersal capacity under natural conditions. together with a <dig>  these lineages are spatially structured in that genetic diversity is positively correlated with distance between localities. altogether, these patterns are consistent with spider species with similar dispersal capacities , and with other loxosceles species, such as those from the canary island  <cit> , loxosceles mrazig, and a related group from the sous valley .

most individuals, however, belong to lineages widespread across the mediterranean . haplotype networks for these lineages have star-like shapes, with one common haplotype shared among individuals distributed across the mediterranean basin, and fewer, less-common haplotypes, restricted to individuals from one or a few localities. for almost all lineages, no clear correspondence exists between haplotypes and geography, with weak correlations between genetic and geographic distances. for example, the most common haplotype from a <dig> is found across the entirety of the mediterranean basin . this lineage, named the “iberian clade” by duncan et al.  <cit> , appears to be the most common in the western mediterranean, and contains individuals from sagunt, the type locality of l. rufescens.

biogeographic patterns within clade b are more complex. the exception is lineage b <dig>  where all individuals are found in the iberian peninsula. in lineages b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig>  individuals with the most common haplotype are widespread across the mediterranean, as in a <dig>  although no clear pattern emerges that links genetic diversity with geography . lineage b <dig> represents the most extreme example of the complex distributional patterns found within l. rufescens. even given the extensive sampling we conducted, we found individuals of this lineage at only five localities, some separated by >4000 km .

discerning between natural and human-mediated dispersals can be difficult in the mediterranean . current genetic patterns for mediterranean lineages do not coincide with those expected as a result of secondary contact through natural processes. if naturally occurring, contact would be restricted to particular areas and/or occur between or among only a few lineages. here, multiple lineages are distributed across the mediterranean, including on islands, a pattern that is difficult to explain by natural processes in organisms with naturally poor dispersal abilities. the lack of geographic structure within most of the mediterranean loxosceles lineages contrasts with the highly structured patterns found for lineages a1-a <dig>  distributed in the mountainous region of morocco, with the former pattern a likely consequence of human-mediated dispersal. although l. rufescens originated in the mediterranean basin , the species has been introduced to many parts of the world, including australia, madagascar and north america  <cit> . human transportation seems a likely mechanism to explain how some haplotypes are distributed across the mediterranean basin, including on several islands and on both african and european shores. loxosceles rufescens possesses two life traits that facilitate dispersal with human assistance: high starvation tolerance  <cit>  and urban microhabitat preferences. maritime commerce in this region has been active for >5000 years  <cit> , and transportation of cultivated plants  <cit> , domesticated animals  <cit> , and wild animals such as reptiles  <cit> , snails  <cit> , mosquitoes  <cit> , and freshwater triclads  <cit>  has been documented widely throughout the mediterranean. thus, the expected “natural” biogeographic patterns have been blurred for this region, and the complex phylogeographic pattern documented for l. rufescens represents a clear example of human influence on species’ distributional dynamics.

refugia and origins of genetic diversity
although human-mediated transportation of l. rufescens likely impacted patterns of distribution for this species within the mediterranean basin, the aim of this study was to assess when and how the distinct lineages originated. combining divergence time and refugial estimates, we marshal two distinct data streams toward answering these questions  <cit> .

our dating analyses place diversification events during the pleistocene . although we are not able to link diversification events to individual climatic events  with any confidence, these dates provide a coarse-resolution estimate of diversification timing. the placement of key diversification events during the pleistocene indicates that processes operating during this period  played an important role in shaping the current diversity of the species, as with numerous other species in the mediterranean basin . the results from our enm analyses largely corroborate the scenario of multiple refugia within the mediterranean for l. rufescens, although details depended on the level of stringency applied for agreement among the eight different aogcm models . the shape and size of refugia differ markedly depending on the aogcm used . in other words, enm is useful for providing general views of putative refugia, rather than for identifying actual borders. combining results from different aogcms, we obtain a consensus view of general patterns for the latter half of the pleistocene epoch  <cit> , which, when an intermediate threshold  is considered, agrees with refugia obtained for plants using phylogeographic approaches  <cit> .

in both methods , major refugia are concentrated in the western maghreb. indeed, in phylogenetic terms, four evolutionary lineages  are found in this area, signifying a hot spot of lineage richness. this richness supports the hypothesis that northern africa is the center of origin for l. rufescens, as previously hypothesized by gertch  <cit>  and duncan et al.  <cit> . additionally, the sister group to l. rufescens is found south of this area, in the high and anti-atlas mountains and the sous valley , which lends further support to a northern african origin for these lineages and for l. rufescens as a whole. this region has been postulated as a climatic refugium for various animals and plants in light of its complex orography  and climatic stability .

more challenging is linking putative refugia to the origins of the mediterranean linages , with current distributional and genetic patterns most likely the result of population mixing through human-mediated transportation. although some of these divergent lineages now occur in sympatry, they likely originated in allopatry, given the dominance of this speciation mechanism for the genus  <cit>  and the geographic results summarized above . lineages a <dig> and b <dig> have small distributions and are endemic to the iberian peninsula, which may reflect refugial areas, especially along the southern and eastern iberian mediterranean coast. however, five other lineages are widely distributed across the mediterranean.

genetic diversity patterns should help in elucidating the origins of these lineages, assuming that refugial areas harbor higher genetic diversity . such is the case for lineage b <dig> , where the highest genetic diversity is found in the balearic islands, an area identified consistently as a refugium . however, lineages a <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  and b <dig> are widespread across the mediterranean and do not show any correspondence between genetic diversity and a single putative refugial area; these lineages may have originated in one of the remaining predicted refugia , but subsequent processes  appear to have erased ancient biogeographic signals. more extensive sampling in the central and eastern mediterranean may help to resolve this question.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we delimited  <dig> evolutionary lineages within loxosceles rufescens in the mediterranean basin based on mtdna data. genetic diversity was not distributed uniformly, and we found two contrasting phylogeographic patterns:  the southern region of morocco holds several lineages with well-structured populations,  whereas lineages distributed across the broader mediterranean basin generally lack geographic structure. by combining results from eight aogcms with two different refugium-delimitation methodologies, we corroborated the scenario of multiple refugia within the mediterranean, principally in northern africa. enms were useful for providing general views of putative refugia, with fine-scale details depending on the level of stringency applied for agreement among models. although refugial delimitation remains challenging, by combining enm with phylogeographic approaches, we found support for the hypothesis that northern africa was the center of origin for l. rufescens, that current genetic diversity probably originated in allopatry and was promoted by successive glaciations during the pleistocene, and that protracted human activities impacted the current distributional patterns of l. rufescens within the mediterranean basin.
