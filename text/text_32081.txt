BACKGROUND
trypsin-like serine peptidases of the s1a subfamily  are found in all metazoan groups and are involved in a variety of biological processes  <cit> . they are synthesized as inactive zymogens which are activated by proteolytic cleavage at a defined site n-terminal to the proteolytic domain. they may consist of the proteolytic domain only  or may contain one or more additional domains, generally n-terminal to the proteolytic domain . s1a peptidases are generally extracellular peptidases although some have intracellular functions  <cit> . s1a peptidases involved in digestion commonly consist of a proteolytic domain only, but single domain s1a peptidases may exhibit strict specificity and serve regulatory roles  <cit> . however, regulatory s1a peptidases generally include one or more additional domains  <cit> . trypsins are s1a peptidases with a specific architecture that cleave substrates after arg and lys  <cit> . they are common digestive enzymes in metazoans and their zymogens are activated by trypsins or enteropeptidases  <cit> . once activated, the digestive trypsins contribute to the proteolysis of ingested proteins and also activate other digestive zymogens such as chymotrypsinogens and proelastases  <cit> .

s1a peptidases also play important roles during fertilization and early development; at fertilization s1a peptidases are necessary to prevent polyspermy by catalyzing formation of a fertilization envelope  <cit>  and in the early embryo, s1a peptidases participate in developmental control  <cit>  and cell migration  <cit> . egg yolk degradation has been reported to be catalyzed both by aspartic and cysteine cathepsins and serine peptidases, including s1a peptidases  <cit> . s1a peptidases involved in egg yolk degradationare suggested mainly to serve in degradome activation  <cit> , but it should be noted that the main mechanism controlling activation of yolk degrading proteases appears to be decreasing yolk granule ph  <cit> .

proteins needed before the midblastula transition are supplied maternally or encoded by maternal mrna. s1a peptidases exerting their role in the embryos prior to the midblastula transition appear to be transcribed and translated either maternally  <cit>  or by germ line cells other than the oocyte  <cit> . proteases involved in, or putatively involved in, yolk degradation generally appear to be translated before fertilization  <cit>  although embryonic transcription and translation of a vitellogenin degrading s1a peptidase has been reported in bombyx mori  <cit> . however, the exact spatiotemporal patterns of transcription and translation are unknown for many peptidases active during early development. maternal transcripts have been reported to comprise transcripts from more than 50% of the protein encoding genes in an organism  <cit> . however, detailed studies of maternally encoded s1a peptidases have not been reported previously.

salmon lice  are obligate ectoparasites on salmonid fishes and a major pest in salmon aquaculture. adult female salmon lice are fertilized by males that deposit spematophores at the genital segment  <cit> . at regular temperature dependent intervals ) they produce a pair of eggstrings  that are fertilized when they are extruded  <cit> . during characterization of trypsins and trypsin-like peptidases in l. salmonis  <cit>  we identified an intronless single domain trypsin that was transcribed by adult female l. salmonis . in the present study lstryp <dig> is characterized and functional implications are discussed.

RESULTS
sequence analysis
est sequencing led to identification of a  <dig> b.p. transcript encoding a serine proteinase named lstryp <dig>  the transcript consist of a  <dig> b.p. orf, a  <dig> b.p. 5' untranslated region  and a  <dig> b.p. 3' utr. alignment of genomic and corresponding cdna sequences revealed that lstryp <dig> is devoid of introns. the protein was predicted to be secreted from the cell using the analytical strategy recommended by emanuelsson et al.  <cit> . the encoded  <dig> amino acid  protein with a predicted weight of  <dig> kda consist of a putative  <dig> a.a. signal peptide, a  <dig> a.a. activation peptide and a  <dig> a.a. proteolytic domain. the proteolytic domain in the predicted protein includes the catalytic triad his <dig>  asp <dig> and ser <dig> in a sequence context typical for proteinases of the s1a subfamily in addition to residues characteristic for s1a peptidases with trypsin specificity, including tyr <dig>  asp <dig>  gln <dig>  gly <dig> and gly <dig> . the encoded trypsinogen appear to contain the  <dig> cysteine bridges conserved in s1a peptidases  <cit>  and an additional cysteine bridge between cys <dig> and cys <dig>  however, lstryp <dig> do not contain the disulphide bridge  conserved in previously described single domain trypsins from l. salmonis  <cit> . the overall identity to previously published trypsins from l. salmonis  <cit>  was â‰¤ 33%.

phylogenetic analysis
the phylogenetic analysis shows that vertebrate, crustacean and insect trypsins reside on separate well-supported branches . furthermore the vertebrate acrosins, found in sperm cells, form a distinct group within a well-supported monophyletic clade that includes cortex granule serine protease  <dig>  found in sea urchin eggs. most of the internal nodes in the phylogenetic tree were not supported  due to the high frequencies of highly conserved and highly divergent residues resulting in relatively low prevalence of informative semi-conserved residues. lstryp <dig> does not appear to be closer related to previously characterized l. salmonis single domain trypsins  <cit>  than to any of the other supported trypsin branches. it should be noted that although lstryp <dig> resides on the same branch as the clip domain containing serine peptidase lscsp <dig>  <cit>  this position is not supported .

stage specific lstryp <dig> transcription and size confirmation
a single transcript of approximately  <dig> b.p. was identified in the northern hybridization analysis . this corresponds well with the  <dig> b.p. cdna sequence. in northern blot analyses lstryp <dig> mrna was undetectable in adult males but present in mature females and unfertilized eggstrings . this pattern was confirmed by q-pcr analyses where lstryp <dig> mrna was present at background levels in preadult stages and adult males, but was significantly upregulated in adult females . microarray analysis have furthermore shown that lstryp <dig> transcript abundance increase during development after the last molt in females .

localization of lstryp <dig> mrna
in situ hybridization showed that lstryp <dig> mrna was present in the ovary and in the oocytes throughout the oviduct . lstryp <dig> mrna is homogenously dispersed in the oocytes localized in the anterior part of the oviducts in cephalothorax. upon entry into the genital segment the oocytes expand substantially in size, apparently due to incorporation of granules and lipids, and lstryp <dig> mrna becomes localized to the periphery of the ova .

yolk lumen acidification, lstryp <dig> protein localization, translation and mrna degradation
lstryp <dig> protein was found in embryos and unfertilized mature eggs. in the unfertilized oocytes inside the genital segment lstryp <dig> was distributed along the oocyte periphery and in patches associated with yolk granules . after fertilization, lstryp <dig> was also shown to be present throughout the embryonic cells and in patches associated with yolk granules . negative controls were performed without primary antibodies and confirmed specific staining. relative quantification showed that the lstryp <dig> protein level in the fertilized eggs increased between  <dig> hour and  <dig> hours after fertilization and then remained stable, whereas the encoding lstryp <dig> mrna level decreased steadily from  <dig> to  <dig> hours after fertilization . in contrast the lstryp <dig> mrna level in unfertilized eggs appeared relatively stable between  <dig> and  <dig> hours after extrusion and then decreased to a level comparable to that found in fertilized eggs  <dig> hours after fertilization . the yolk compartment was shown to be acidic at day  <dig> after fertilization by exposing embryos to lysotracker, whereas no indications of acidic compartments were identified elsewhere in the embryo .

discussion
the results show that lstryp <dig> encodes a peptidase that includes the catalytic triad residues  in a context typical for serine peptidases of the s1a clan in addition to the specificity determinants for trypsin  <cit> . transcript length and presence was confirmed by northern blot analysis . interestingly, lstryp <dig> is devoid of introns, which is a feature also reported for functional digestive trypsins in anopheles gambiae  <cit> . the phylogenetic analysis do not indicate a reliable phylogenetic position for lstryp <dig>  which appears no closer related to other single domain trypsins from l. salmonis  <cit>  than to bacterial trypsin or the clip domain containing lscsp <dig>  <cit> . cgsp <dig>  which is thought to activate the fertilization envelope and prevent polyspermy in sea urchins  <cit> , appears to be closer related to acrosins than to the other serine peptidases included in the analysis. since this may give the impression that s1a peptidases related to fertilization form a monophyletic assemblage it should be noted that mouse tesp <dig> which is suggested to have a fertilization related function  <cit> , resides on a well supported branch with pancreatic trypsin from cow and chicken .

background lstryp <dig> transcription is detected in all investigated l. salmonis stages except adult females where it is upregulated more than 2000-fold relative to the level in nauplius ii larvae . in situ hybridization results show that lstryp <dig> mrna is transcribed in the ovary. lstryp <dig> transcripts are evenly distributed in the immature oocytes in the anterior oviduct in cephalothorax , but are located along the periphery of the ova in the genital segment . the change in distribution of lstryp <dig> mrna indicates that the transcripts are actively localized in the egg, as are the transcription factor bicoid mrna in drosophila melanogaster and the transforming growth factor vg <dig> mrna in xenopus laevis  <cit> . the 3' utr in lstryp <dig> mrna is substantially longer  than the 3'-utrs  in previously characterized l. salmonis s1a peptidases  <cit> . considering that localization of many transcripts, including bicoid mrna and vg <dig> mrna, depends on elements in their 3' utrs  <cit>  the relatively long lstryp <dig> mrna 3' utr may contain elements involved in control of mrna localization and translation.

the distribution of lstryp <dig> mrna suggests that it is a maternal transcript. this notion appears to be supported by the simultaneous lstryp <dig> mrna translation and degradation after fertilization . however, immunohistochemical studies demonstrate this perception to be incorrect as lstryp <dig> protein is found in oocytes inside the female's genital segment as well as in most embryonic cells . the question then arises: is the embryonic lstryp <dig> protein encoded by maternal mrna? the first cleavage in order siphonostomatoida  is holoblastic but strongly unequal with the smaller cell giving rise to the embryonic cells and the larger cell containing most of the yolk  <cit> . a similar development in l. salmonis must be expected which implies that only a small fraction of the deposited maternal mrna is present in the embryonic cells. the stable level of lstryp <dig> mrna in developing eggs  may thus be the product of a simultaneous degradation of maternal lstryp <dig> mrna in the large yolk containing cell and zygotic transcription of lstryp <dig> mrna in the developing embryonic cells  <cit> . the very low expected levels of maternal lstryp <dig> encoding transcripts inside the embryonic cells thus strongly indicates that lstryp <dig> protein translated after fertilization is encoded by zygotically transcribed lstryp <dig> mrna. it is plausible that the maternal and zygotic lstryp <dig> mrnas are encoded by paralog genes.

in the oocytes, maternally deposited lstryp <dig> protein  was found along the periphery and in patches associated with vitellogenin granules inside the yolk compartment . this yolk associated localization resembles the reported distribution of an artemia trypsin-like peptidase with a putative degradome activating function  <cit>  as well as other peptidases putatively involved in yolk degradation or degradome activation  <cit> . earlier reports suggest, that serine peptidases are not directly responsible for yolk degradation but activate a second set of peptidases  that perform the degradation of the yolk  <cit> . a similar function for mlstryp <dig> protein is likely. yolk degradation appear to be initiated by yolk granule acidification in many invertebrate species  <cit> . this may also be the case in l. salmonis as we observed acidic conditions in the yolk compartment in  <dig> days old embryos. it is possible that acidification leads to autoactivation of mlstryp <dig> protein that in turn activates the general yolk degradome. the lstryp <dig> protein translated by the embryo  is found in all embryonic cells, including cells in the antennae  which indicate that elstryp <dig> has a function not related to egg yolk degradation. based on the ubiquitous distribution of elstryp <dig> it is likely to be involved in general developmental processes such as modification of the cell-matrix e.g. associated with cell movement  <cit> 

in conclusion, lstryp <dig> is a trypsin which is both deposited in the oocytes and translated after fertilization. maternally deposited and embryonic lstryp <dig> seems to be translated from different pools of mrna; one maternally transcribed and one transcribed after fertilization. the deposited lstryp <dig> is likely to be involved in egg yolk degradation whereas embryonic lstryp <dig> appears to serve a different purpose, e.g. cell matrix modification. lstryp <dig> is the first arthropod peptidase reported to be both maternally deposited and translated in developing embryos.

CONCLUSIONS
an intronless trypsin-like serine peptidase, lstryp <dig>  was characterized in l. salmonis. lstryp <dig> mrna was significantly upregulated in adult females relative to all other investigated stages. lstryp <dig> mrna was found in the ovaries, oviducts, ova and developing embryos. the encoded protein was found in ova as well as in developing embryos where it was also shown to be translated. considering the pattern of the first cell divisions in l. salmonis, the present results indicate that lstryp <dig> proteins in the embryos stem from two distinct lines of synthesis. first maternally transcribed and translated lstryp <dig> protein is deposited in the oocytes and second embryonically transcribed lstryp <dig> mrna is translated in all embryonic cells. the maternally produced lstryp <dig> protein is likely to be involved in yolk degradation or yolk degradation control, whereas the function of embryonically produced lstryp <dig> protein is unknown.
