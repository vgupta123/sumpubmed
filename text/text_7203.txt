BACKGROUND
the sodom apple, also called crown flower or giant milkweed, belongs to the asclepiadaceae family and is a large evergreen shrub native to tropics and subtropics of asia and africa. since its seed coat produces fine, silky, durable, and high-quality fiber which is used broadly in industrial applications, sodom apple is known as crystal cotton  <cit> . the genus calotropis has two species: calotropis gigantea  and c. procera   <cit> . although they are morphologically similar in that their leaves are opposite, broad, sub-sessile and ovoid follicles, sub-globose, or oblong-lanceolate, and inflated mesocarp  <cit>  with fiber embedded beneath the seeds, taxonomically, c. gigantea is distinguished from c. procera by its reflexed corolla with five petals which are white to pale lilac blue  <cit> .

with cotton prices soaring in recent years, the textile industry worldwide is now facing severe challenges  <cit> . exploring new fiber resources to enrich the fiber supply has drawn great attention in the industry. due to the high-quality fiber produced with the seed coat and its characteristics of being fast-growing, drought hardy, and having wide adaptation to soil conditions, developing the cultivation of sodom apple to provide fine and high-quality fiber materials has created great interest in many countries  <cit> . also, sodom apple has been used as a source of medicine because its milk-like latex contains various active-compounds such osmotin and lupeol, and other plant parts contain cardiac glycosides, flavonoids, phenolic compounds, and terpenoides  <cit> , which are responsible for the various it’s pharmacological properties  <cit> . due to its potential economic importance, the sodom apple has been introduced to the pacific islands, australia, as well as to central and south america  <cit> . in recent years, efforts on planting sodom apples for fiber or medicine resources have been employed in many regions  <cit> . however, sodom apple is still an undomesticated plant with uncertain economic returns. to facilitate breeding and improvement of varieties, there is an urgent need for investigating the molecular basis of traits concerned with fiber biosynthesis and developing molecular markers in sodom apple.

transcriptomic data provide a great opportunity for discovering novel genes and collecting a number of ests , which facilitates the development of molecular markers, in particular for non-model organisms without a reference genome  <cit> . in this study, we de novo assembled and characterized the transcriptome of sodom apple. in particular, we detected various novel transcripts involved in fiber biosynthesis. to our knowledge, this study is the first report on characterizing the complete transcriptome data in the genus calotropis, serving as a valuable resource for novel gene discovery, molecular marker development and genetic improvement in practice.

RESULTS
illumina paired-end sequencing data and de novo assembly
in total, our high throughput sequencing generated approximately  <dig> million paired end reads. after stringent quality checking and data cleaning, approximately  <dig> gb reads were obtained with  <dig>  % q <dig> bases with a gc content of  <dig>  %. an assembler, trinity developed specifically for use with next-generation short-read sequences  <cit> , was employed for de novo assembly. the raw sequence data generated was deposited at the ncbi  short read archive under accession number srx <dig>  we assembled a total of  <dig>  transcripts with a mean of  <dig> . the transcripts were further clustered into  <dig>  unigenes with a mean length of  <dig>  bp and n <dig> value of 1733 bp. among the unigenes,  <dig>   unigenes were greater than 1 kb and  <dig>   were between 200–300 bp. since the shorter sequences may lack a characterized protein domain or may be too short to show sequence matches, resulting in false-negative results, the contigs which were less than 200 bp in length were excluded in our homology searches . the length distributions of the unigenes are shown in fig.  <dig>  sequence annotations of all unigenes were predicted with hmmer parameter e-value of not more than 10− <dig> or blast  with an e-value threshold of 10− <dig> in the ncbi database of non-redundant protein , along with the swiss-prot protein database, the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database, the clusters of orthologous groups  database, eukaryotic orthologous groups of proteins , protein families , and the gene ontology  database. finally, after sequence annotation,  <dig>   unigenes were predicted and  <dig>   unigenes are still unknown.table  <dig> summary of sequencing data and de novo assembling

functional annotation
all  <dig>  unigenes were annotated by aligning with the deposited ones in diverse protein databases mentioned above. as a result,  <dig>   were successfully annotated. among these annotated unigenes,  <dig>   had significant marches in the nr database,  <dig>   had significant marches to pfam database,  <dig>   had significant marches to go database, while  <dig>   had marches to the swiss-prot database . in total,  <dig>  unigenes obtained were blast for homology searches, resulting in  <dig>   unigenes showing similarity to known protein databases. the e-value distribution of the top hits in the nr database revealed that  <dig>  % of the mapped sequences showed significant homology  while  <dig>  % had an e-value between  <dig> e− <dig> and  <dig>  e− <dig> . score distribution showed that  <dig>  % of the unigenes had scores > <dig> and  <dig>  % < <dig> . for unigene sequences in the nr annotations, as shown in fig. 3c, blast search analysis further revealed that a total  <dig>   had the most similar sequences to proteins from solanum lycopersicum, followed by vitis vinifera,  <dig>  , theobroma cacao,  <dig>  .fig.  <dig> the unigene number annotated in the public database searches

functional classification
in order to classify the functions of predicted unigenes, go analysis  was applied. based on the go annotation, a total of  <dig>  unigenes could be assigned to one or more terms, which were categorized into  <dig> functional groups under three main divisions . in the biological function group, the marched unique sequences  <dig>   were clustered into  <dig> classes. in this category, proteins highly encoded were those involved in metabolic process , followed by cellular process , single-organism process , response to stimulus , and biological regulation . in the molecular function group, these unique sequences  were divided into  <dig> groups. the catalytic activity  and binding  were the predominant groups followed by, transporter activity  and structural molecule activity . cellular components were grouped into  <dig> classes, within which the assignments were mostly enriched in the cell part  and cell  followed by , membrane , and organelle part  .fig.  <dig> go classification of the unigenes derived from sodom apple. the histogram shows the results of classifying  <dig>  genes into the secondary classification of go terms. right y-axis: number of genes; left y-axis: percentage of genes



to further predict the gene function and evaluate the completeness of the transcriptome library, all the assembled unigenes were searched against the clusters of orthologous groups  database. overall,  <dig>  marched unique sequences were clustered into  <dig> functional categories . the proteins in the cog categories were assumed to have the same ancestor protein or to be paralogs or orthologs. the largest category was translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis with , and transcripts associated with transcription repair  were most common, followed by replication, recombination, and repair  and signal transduction mechanisms  . in addition,  <dig> unigenes  of cog annotated unigenes were assigned to secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism reflected the large amount of secondary metabolites present in the sodom apple. however, cell motility and nuclear structure were assigned nine and one unigenes, respectively, whereas no unigene was assigned to extracellular structures . it was found that categories with no concrete assignment, such as function unknown  and general function prediction only , accounted for a large fraction of transcripts .fig.  <dig> histogram presentation of cog function classification. a total of  <dig>  unigenes showing significant homology to the cog database within ncbi  were classified into  <dig> categories



kegg classification
the kegg pathway database records the networks of molecular interactions in the cells and their variants specific to particular organisms. all the unigenes were analyzed against the kegg pathway database. in total,  <dig>   sequences were identified in the kegg database and were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways , covering five major kegg categories, including metabolism , genetic information processing , environmental information processing , cellular processes  and organismal systems  . among them,  <dig>  unigenes were assigned to the metabolic pathways category. biosynthesis of secondary metabolites  and ribosome  were also highly represented . within the metabolic pathway, carbohydrate metabolism was the most highly represented with starch and sugar metabolism, a pathway involved in cellulose biosynthesis the main component of sodom apple fiber  <cit> , being assigned  <dig> unigenes . in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites category,  <dig> unigenes were classified into  <dig> subcategories, the most prominent being phenylpropanoid biosynthesis , terpenoid backbone biosynthesis , tropane, piperidine and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis , carotenoid biosynthesis , flavonoid biosynthesis , and zeatin biosynthesis . in addition, other metabolites included isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis , diterpenoid biosynthesis , limonene and pinene degradation , stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis , brassinosteroid biosynthesis , caffeine metabolism , and flavone and flavonol biosynthesis  . several genes encoding biosynthesis of secondary metabolites were identified . these unigenes involved in metabolism pathways could provide a critical clue for identifying novel genes involved in biosynthesis of high-quality fiber and unique chemical compounds in calotropis plants.fig.  <dig> kegg pathway assignment of unigenes. a based on five main categories; b based on highly-represented pathways; c based on metabolic pathway; d based on secondary metabolite metabolism



identification of genes involved in fiber biosynthesis in sodom apple
as reported, cellulose, lignin, and pectin are major components of fiber and their content in the fiber could significantly influence the yield and quality of fiber  <cit> . the genes for cellulose and pectin biosynthesis were identified in the starch-sugar pathway where a total of  <dig> genes were annotated in the kegg pathway, whereas genes involved in lignin biosynthesis were found in the phenylpropanoid pathway where  <dig> unigenes were annotated to the pathway .fig.  <dig> hypothetical figure showing sodom apple unigenes that may be involved in fiber biosynthesis. the numbers in the brackets following each gene name indicate the number of unigenes annotated to that gene, red label indicate annotated gene: cesa ; pal ; pgm ; 4cl ; ccr ; pdrx ; ugp ; gaut ; pe ; gae 



while focusing on identification of novel genes involved in fiber biosynthesis in sodom apple, we detected  <dig> genes involved in cellulose, lignin, and pectin biosynthesis. in particular, one unigene encoding pgm  enzyme, one unigene for ugp <dig> , five unigenes encoding enzyme cellulose synthase   were identified. genes involved in pectin biosynthesis, one unigene encoding gae , one unigene encoding gaut , and seven unigenes encoding pectin modifying enzymes pectin esterases were also found . for lignin biosynthesis, transcripts encoding various enzymes were identified. they included, one unigene encoding phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, one unigene encoding cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, three unigenes encoding 4- hydroxycinnamoyl coa ligase, two unigenes encoding cinnamoyl coa reductase and  <dig> unigenes encoding peroxidase . the identification of genes involved in metabolism pathways gives a potential basis for gene discovery and cloning from sodom apple.

identification of transcription factors involved in abiotic stress response
as previously reported, the sodom apple is drought and salt tolerant  <cit> . identification of potential transcription factors involved in regulating physiological responses to abiotic stress might add additional understanding in the potential molecular mechanisms of drought and salt tolerance in sodom apple. we identified various transcription factor families which might be involved in regulatory response to abiotic stress, including btf <dig> , myb , ap2/ethylene-responsive transcription factor 1b  and bzip   unigenes transcription factors . in particular, many identified transcripts with putative transcription factors have not been assigned to any known transcription factors.

validation of unigenes and gene expression profiling using real-time pcr
in order to experimentally validate the reliability of the unigenes obtained from the assembled transcriptome and gene expression profile, four unigenes involved in fiber biosynthesis, such as the unigenes c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> encoding a key cellulose synthase cesa, were tested using real-time pcr. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the expression profiles of the four unigenes tested among different tissues exhibited that all the transcripts were expressed in the tested tissues. apart from unigene c <dig> in which leaf showed highest expression, the highest expression for three genes was in developing seed coats, in consistent with that the seed coat tissue is the most active in fiber biosynthesis.fig.  <dig> real-time pcr analysis of four unigenes associated with the fiber biosynthesis. error bars were calculated based on three replicates. actin gene  was used as an internal control for normalization



simple sequence repeats  loci discovery
to develop molecular markers of marker-assisted selection for genetic breeding and improvement, the  <dig>  unigenes generated were used to mine potential microsatellites by using misa software. a total of  <dig>  unique sequences were examined, resulting in an identification of  <dig>  putative microsatellites , covering  <dig>  perfect ssr loci, and  <dig> loci in a compound form . the most abundant repeat motif was dinucleotide,  <dig>  , followed by trinucleotides,  <dig>  , tetranucleotide,  <dig> , pentanucleotide,  <dig>  and hexanucleotide,  <dig> . ssrs with six tandem repeats  were most common, followed by five , seven , eight , nine  and > <dig>  . at/ta motifs constituted more than half  of the total number of dinucleotides. further,  <dig>  ssr primer pairs were successfully designed using software primer  <dig>  the details of the frequency of ssr motif and genic-ssr primers sequences  are summarized in additional file  <dig>  these ssr loci would provide a great way to develop polymorphic ssr markers in sodom apple.table  <dig> distribution and frequency of est-ssrs identified in sodom apple



discussion
characterization of the sodom apple transcriptome
transcriptome sequencing has become an important tool because of its low cost and high throughput  <cit> . in the recent past, many de novo transcriptome data on non-model plants including centella asiatica  <cit> , ramia  <cit> , liriodendron chinense  <cit> , gossypium aridum  <cit> , and gossypium hirsutum  <cit>  have been generated by using the illumina high throughput sequencing technology. these transcriptome data provide valuable resources for further studies in these plants.

in this study, the transcriptome sequencing was carried out using the illumina genome analyser system platform hiseq <dig> read-length of 125 bp, which is longer than other sequencing platforms, such as hiseq <dig>  and much faster. more than  <dig> million high-quality reads were used to de novo assemble the transcriptome of various tissues. the reads were assembled into  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of  <dig>  bp and an n <dig> of  <dig>  bp, which is used for assembly evaluation and a high number  <cit> , suggest a high quality assembly in this study. the q <dig> of  <dig>  % with a gc value of  <dig>  % also reflects a high quality sequencing run  <cit> . the protein homology searches revealed that sodom apple unigenes had highest similarity to solanum lycopersicum  genes, implying that sodom apple may phylogenically be closer to solanum plants than to other eudict plants for which genome annotation has been done, such as vitis vinifera, populus trichocarpa and glycine max. these results indicate that our current high throughput sequencing data and transcriptome assembly are of high quality and these data will provide a solid foundation for further gene discovery, marker development, marker-assisted selection breeding, and genetic improvement studies in sodom apple.

transcriptome assembly and gene annotation
in this study,  <dig>   unigenes out of  <dig>  identified were successfully annotated using blast searches of the public nr, pfam, swiss-prot, go, cog, and kegg databases. this means that more than half of unigenes generated were not annotated according to existing databases. this could be as a result of several reasons such as the absence of genomic information on the family asclepiadaceae, the unigenes without hits probably belonged to untranslated regions, they could also have been non-coding rna, short sequences not containing a protein domain, or assembly mistakes  <cit> . since genomic and transcriptomic information is currently lacking in the family asclepiadaceae in databases, these unigenes without hits may be considered putative novel transcribed sequences. therefore, according to these results, there is a need to generate a large collection of unigenes and further characterize the gene structures and expression patterns in sodom apple.

the best hit for each unigene queried against the ncbi nr database was utilized to assign functional go annotation in terms of biological process, molecular function, and cellular component groups . the large number of diverse go assignments to unigenes highlights the diversity of genes likely represented in the transcriptome data. the functions of the identified genes cover various molecular functional categories which was the highest go ontology, and the well-represented categories included atp binding  metal ion binding , dna binding  zinc ion binding , nucleotide binding , protein binding , and the structural constituent of ribosome . the sequences encoded a broad set of transcripts represented within the molecular component category which indicates the need for a large number of transcripts for carrying out various biochemical processes. the results demonstrated that high throughput transcriptome sequencing is an efficient, reliable, and inexpensive tool for transcriptome analysis in sodom apple. these gene annotations would provide a valuable resource for investigating specific physiological processes, gene structures and functions, and metabolism pathways in sodom apple.

potential candidate genes involving fiber biosynthesis
de novo transcriptome assembly and characterization based on high throughput sequencing technology has enabled the rapid identification of candidate genes involved in various biosynthesis pathways such as carotenoid genes in liriodendron chinese  <cit> , lipid genes in sacha inchi  <cit> , steroidal sapogen genes in asparagus racemosus  <cit> , cesa gene in ramie   <cit> , and lignin biosynthesis genes in celery  <cit> , among others. as an important fiber plant, dissecting the molecular mechanism of fiber development in sodom apple is an attractive research area with a focus on novel gene discovery, improving fiber quality, yield, and genetic improvement. carbohydrate and energy metabolisms play an important role in the fiber development by providing the carbon skeletons for the synthesis of cell wall polysaccharides  <cit> . udp-d-glucose is a central metabolite in carbohydrate metabolism and is the common precursor for synthesis of cell wall polysaccharides such as pectin, hemicelluloses, and cellulose. in cellulose udp-d, glucose is involved in the formation of cellulose synthase   central catalysts involved in initiation and elongation of plant cell wall cellulose  <cit> , which is a component of sodom apple fiber.

cellulose is the main cell wall polysaccharides important in fiber growth and development  <cit> . cesa genes have been the cellulose synthase most extensively studied in plants such as ramia, arabidopsis, rice and cotton . in this study, unigenes encoding cesa were identified on the basis of kegg database searches, of which 61 % of sodom apple fiber is constituted of cellulose  <cit> . the real-time pcr experiments revealed that the four tested cesa genes were highly expressed in seed coat tissues where fibers are actively biosynthesized, strongly suggesting that these genes are involved in the biosynthesis of fibers in sodom apple. further studies focusing on characterizing the function of cesa genes would provide clues in understanding the mechanisms of fiber development in sodom apple.

as sodom apple fiber does not undergo secondary cell wall deposition, pectin is an important fiber component. in the present study, several transcripts encoding enzymes involved in synthesis of pectin were found, 1– <dig> galacturonosyltransferase, a key enzyme for pectin biosynthesis  <cit> , catalyzes  <dig>  d-galacturonosyl to galacturonic acid, the primary pectic polysaccharide of the plant primary wall  <cit> . utp-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase  catalyzes the formation of udp-glucose from glucose-1-phosphate and utp, involved in the formation of udp-d-glucoranate while udp-d-glucuronate-5-epimerase  converts udp-a-d-glucuronic acid to udp-galacturonic a precursor of pectin  <cit> . galacturonosyltransferase  transfers galacturonic acid from uridine 5’-diphosphogalacturonic acid onto the pectic polysaccharide homogalacturonan  <cit> . in addition, gene encoding pectin modifying enzymes pectin esterases which might play a major role in the fiber cell wall development were also identified  in our current study.

lignin is another component of sodom apple fiber consisting of about 21 % of fiber content after cellulose  and pectin   <cit> . lignins are complex racemic aromatic heteropolymers that are derived from monolignols which are products of the phenylpropanoid metabolism  <cit> . among the lignin biosynthesis transcripts identified from our transcriptome, pal is the first enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway and catalyzes the deamination of phenylalanine to produce trans-cinnamic acid. cinnate 4-hydroxylase , belonging to the cyp73a group of cytochrome p450-dependent monooxygenases protein family, hydroxylates cinnamic acid to generate p-coumaric acid, whereas, 4-couramarate coa  is responsible for the coa esterification of p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, 5-hydroxyferulic acid, and sinapic acid. in addition, the peroxidase enzyme promotes polymerization of monolignols resulting in lignins  <cit>  .

according to lignin metabolic pathways five genes required to encode the related enzymes were found in our transcriptome data set. the existence of lignin in sodom apple has a negative effect on their dye uptake and dye fixation  <cit>  which affects the utilization of this fiber for textile industry. thus, understanding its biosynthesis is critical in improvement of this fiber. for example, it has been found that down regulating 4cl can decrease lignin content while increasing cellulose components  <cit> .

secondary metabolites identified
a wide range of chemical compounds have been isolated from the sodom apple, including glycosides  <cit> , flavonoids and triterpenoids  <cit> , cardiac glycosides  <cit> , phenolic compounds, and terpenoides  <cit>  which are associated with its medicinal potential. the kegg pathway analysis of all unigenes identified supported these results by the presence of a large number of transcripts involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis.

terpenoids are an important class of secondary metabolites in sodom apple; two pathways directly related to terpenoid biosynthesis  were present in our transcriptome. terpenoids are synthesized through two main pathways, the mevalonate and pyruvate/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate pathways  <cit> . in our transcriptome data, several of the transcripts annotated to these two pathways including acetyl-coa c- acetyltransferase, hydroxymethylglutaryl-coa synthase, mevalonate kinase, and 1- deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase. the zeatin biosynthesis and carotenoid biosynthesis pathways related to terpenoid biosynthesis were annotated in our library. alkaloids are other important secondary metabolites that are mainly involved in defense and are responsible for many of the medicinal properties of plants  <cit> . kegg pathway analysis of our transcriptome revealed two secondary metabolite pathways directly related to alkaloid biosynthesis, i.e., isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis and tropane, piperidine, and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis . since amino acids are the main precursors of all alkaloids, we observed transcripts for several enzymes in alkaloid biosynthetic pathways such as amine oxidase, amino transferase, and amino acid decarboxylase. in addition, flavonoids are also important secondary metabolites that perform a variety of essential functions in higher plants  <cit> . among the secondary metabolite pathways in sodom apple, transcripts annotated to the main enzymes of the flavonoid biosynthesis and flavonol biosynthesis pathways were observed in our transcriptome, including flavonoid-3-hydroxylase, flavanone-3-hydroxylase, flavonol synthase . the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway, which was the most highly represented secondary metabolite pathway , is also closely related to flavonoid biosynthesis because the metabolite phenylalanine is the only precursor for flavonoid biosynthesis  <cit> . several important phenylpropanoid biosynthetic enzymes linking primary metabolism to flavonoid biosynthesis were observed in our transcriptome, including phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, and 4- coumarate-coa ligase. overall,  <dig>  % of the cog annotated unigenes fell into the secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism category . our functional classification of sodom apple genes indicates the presence of a large number of active secondary metabolite processes, providing strong transcriptomic evidence to support previous biochemical observations.

identification of transcription factor involved in stress response
transcription factors usually play crucial roles in adjusting plant adaptation to adverse environments. sodom apple is a deep rooted, wild shrub well-acclimatized to salinity and drought  <cit> . transcript profiling can be a significant tool for the characterization of stress-responsive genes transcriptional factor. among transcription factors identified from our data, btf <dig> is one of the most important transcription factors due to their role in various biotic and abiotic stress processes and different physiological and developmental mechanisms such as ionic homeostasis in plants  <cit> . the ap2s and erfs have been found to be involved in various biotic and abiotic stress responses  <cit> . in particular, bzips have been known to be involved in salt and drought tolerance  <cit> . both myc and myb tfs have been found to participate in the abscissic acid -dependent pathway of stress signaling for the upregulation of the abiotic stress responsive genes  <cit>  which could possibly be the case even in the sodom apple. however, it needs further functional validations on whether these transcription factors identified from sodom apple have specific function in increasing salt and drought tolerance. the presence of these transcription factors identified in our transcriptome data in this study would guide further gene discovery and functional experiments for their important characterization in further genetic improvement.

ssr discovery
ssr molecular markers are locus-specific, co-dominant, multi-allelic, highly polymorphic, and transferable among species within genera  <cit> . est-ssr markers are very important for studies involving genetic diversity, cultivar identification, evolution, linkage mapping, qtl mapping, comparative genomics, and marker-assisted selection breeding  <cit> . high throughput transcriptome sequencing provides plenty of ssr loci for molecular marker development. the  <dig>  putative microsatellites located on unigenes obtained from sodom apple provided very helpful resources for designing primers  which will be used for developing molecular markers and serving various research purposes in sodom apple.

CONCLUSIONS
the focus of this study was to employ the illumina high throughput sequencing platform to characterize and assemble the transcriptome of c. gigantea in order to provide a large transcriptome sequence dataset. in this study, we obtained  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of  <dig>  bp. importantly, we found many transcripts that encode for putative proteins that are involved in fiber and secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and the fiber candidate genes were validated using the real-time pcr method. various transcription factors related to stress were also identified. this study demonstrated that high throughput transcriptome sequencing is an efficient, reliable, and in expensive tool for transcriptome analysis and marker discovery in sodom apple. to our knowledge, this is the first report on investigating the whole transcriptome data using high throughput sequencing technology in the genus calotropis. we trust that this dataset will be valuable in improving further research on molecular mechanisms of fiber biosynthesis, stress tolerance, and as a resource for future improvement through marker-assisted breeding and genetic diversity studies in the sodom apple.
