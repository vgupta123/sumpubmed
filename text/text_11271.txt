BACKGROUND
sugar beet  is a biennial plant, a member of the chenopodiaceae family  <cit> . in the first year after germination, a rosette of leaves develops while the taproot swells and accumulates sucrose. in the second year, flower initiation is induced after vernalization in the preceding winter. beets are harvested at the end of the first year when sugar content of the taproot is high. transgenic approaches towards modification of specific traits comprise the increase of pathogen resistance, the increase of sugar content and the improvement of sugar storage. these approaches require promoters that direct gene expression in a timely and spatial manner which is determined by the desired expression profile of the transgene.

in many cases improvement of transgenic traits in plants were achieved by using specific promoters  <cit> . furthermore, to accomplish high tissue specific protein production in transgenic plants, often promoters from photosynthetic or storage specific genes are employed  <cit> .

for the identification of desired promoters, a subtractive approach to enrich differentially expressed genes or a large scale approach to identify these genes in cdna libraries may be employed prior to promoter isolation. one possible way to identify nonredundant clones in a cdna library is the method of oligonucleotide fingerprinting  which was recently applied to sugar beet  <cit> . with this approach different cdnas can be identified on a large scale basis within a cdna library. while a large scale ofp approach is a feasible method to identify differentially expressed genes in different cdna libraries, this method is very cost intensive and hence not applicable for many research groups.

a straight forward approach for the isolation of differentially expressed genes was achieved by the "suppression subtractive hybridization" method   <cit> . ssh is a cdna- and a pcr-based technique that includes a step for the equalization of the abundance of different cdna fragments during subtractive hybridization. combined with suppression pcr, selective amplification of differentially expressed cdna sequences was achieved without the application of physical separation methods  <cit> . this method was recently applied to isolate taproot expressed genes from sugar beet  <cit> .

here we have employed ssh for the isolation of leaf expressed sugar beet genes. among the genes isolated was a cdna fragment for a light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding protein . it is shown that sugar beet genotypes harbor either one or two cab genes that are both expressed. to investigate the use of the cab promoters for gene expression, the 5' regulatory sequences were isolated and linked to reporter genes. transient reporter gene assays indicate that both promoters are expressed in sugar beet leaves. in transgenic sugar beet both promoters are expressed in green tissue. sequence analysis revealed that the cab <dig> promoter, in contrast to the cab <dig> promoter, is void of g-box like regulatory sites with a palindromic acgt core sequence. a leaf specific promoter in transgenic sugar beets can be employed for biotechnological applications.

RESULTS
identification of leaf expressed genes from sugar beet
to isolate cdna fragments corresponding to leaf expressed genes, poly+rnas from leaf and taproot were isolated and subjected to cdna synthesis. suppression subtractive hybridization was performed as described in methods. a total of  <dig> cdna clones specific for the subtraction for leaf expressed genes were isolated and sequenced . fourteen out of  <dig> cdnas were found to be different. table  <dig> shows that  <dig> out of these  <dig> clones have homology mainly to nuclear encoded genes involved in the calvin cycle and in photosynthesis. fragments l <dig> and l <dig> detect homology to the same gene but do not overlap. four clones do not have any sequence homology to a known gene.

to further confirm that the enriched cdna fragments correspond to tissue specific genes, northern blot hybridizations to total rna isolated from leaves , taproots , stems , and inflorescences  were performed with  <dig> cdna fragments. figure  <dig> shows that all but one of the cdna fragments hybridize specifically or much stronger to rna from leaves than to rna from taproots. clone l <dig> hybridizes with similar intensity to rna from all four tissues.

the expression profile of the gene for ssh fragment l <dig> encoding a chlorophyll a/b binding protein  was analysed in more detail. rna from different tissues and from different developmental stages were used in rna blot experiments. rna was isolated from different organs of sugar beets from a field  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> weeks after sowing. this interval covers the lifetime of a sugar beet in central europe. figure  <dig> shows that the gene is expressed only in above ground tissue like petiole, sink and source leaf regardless of the developmental stage. since no expression is observed in below ground tissue like primary and lateral root the promoter of the cab gene was isolated and analysed with reporter gene fusions. compared to the other genes, the expression profile of the gene for ssh fragment l <dig> showed the strongest tissue specificity during the different time points analysed .

isolation of two promoters for the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding protein
for the isolation of a sugar beet promoter corresponding to the cab gene, a complete cdna clone was isolated . a homology search with the encoded  <dig> amino acid long protein reveals a 87% identity to the cab <dig> and 85% identity to the cab <dig> gene from tomato encoding chlorophyll a/b binding protein  <cit> .

prior to the isolation of genomic clones, a gene copy number analysis was performed. dna from sugar beet genotypes 1k <dig> and 4b <dig> was digested with different restriction enzymes and hybridized to the l <dig> fragment . figure  <dig> shows that in genomic dna from genotype 1k <dig> three  and four  hybridizing fragments are detected, while only one  or two  fragments are detected in genotype 4b <dig>  from this result it is concluded that genotype 4b <dig> harbors one and genotype 1k <dig> harbors two copies of the cab gene.

genomic clones for the two different genes were isolated . sequence comparison between the cdna and both genomic clones indicate a very high degree of sequence identity within the coding region. the cab <dig> and cab <dig> amino acid sequence differ only in one position .

from both genes the promoter regions were subcloned into plasmid vectors and sequenced . sequence of  <dig> and  <dig> base pairs, respectively, containing most of the upstream region were deposited to genbank . the  <dig> bp promoter fragment is designated cab <dig> promoter and the  <dig> bp fragment cab <dig> promoter. both fragments harbor  <dig> base pairs coding region of the cab protein and  <dig>  and  <dig>  base pairs upstream untranslated sequence. upstream of the untranslated region only about  <dig> bp are homologous between the two promoters while the rest of the sequence is highly divergent . because the cdna clone isolated before originates from the genotype 4b <dig> and corresponds to the cab <dig> gene, it was investigated if the second gene is also transcribed. towards these ends 5' race amplifications were performed with rna from genotype 1k <dig> and sequenced. this analysis revealed that the cab <dig> gene is also transcribed .

transient expression assays in sugar beet leaves
to test whether the isolated promoters confer reporter gene expression in sugar beet leaves, a transient assay was performed. towards these ends translational fusions of promoter fragments with the luciferase gene from photinus pyralis in the vector pgem-luc were constructed . table  <dig> summarizes the relative gene expression strength obtained with the different promoter reporter gene constructs when transformed into sugar beet leaves. relative to the camv 35s promoter, the strength of all promoter fragments is approximately 20% and no significant drop in gene expression is observed between the largest and smallest promoter fragments. in summary, it can be concluded that the  <dig> bp long fragment from the cab <dig> gene and the  <dig> bp fragment from the cab <dig> gene harbor all cis-regulatory sequences required for gene expression in sugar beet leaves at least under the conditions of the transient bioassay.

the promoter of two chlorophyll a/b binding protein genes confers leaf specific and light inducible gene expression in transgenic sugar beet plants
to investigate if the cab <dig> and cab <dig> promoters from sugar beet drive reporter gene expression in transgenic plants, promoter reporter gene fusions were introduced via agrobacterium mediated transformation in sugar beet . the length of the cab <dig> promoter fragment is  <dig> bp and the length of the cab <dig> promoter fragment  <dig> bp. leaves of transgenic lines transferred to the greenhouse were analysed for reporter gene activity. the cab <dig> promoter of  <dig> independent transformants showed a specific β-glucuronidase  activity from  <dig> to  <dig> pmol mu × min- <dig> × mg- <dig>  respectively . the cab <dig> promoter of  <dig> transformants showed a specific activity from  <dig> to  <dig> pmol mu × min- <dig> × mg- <dig>  respectively . these results indicate that the  <dig> bp cab <dig> promoter fragment and the  <dig> bp cab <dig> promoter fragment are sufficient to confer promoter activity to transgenic sugar beet leaves. furthermore, the cab <dig> promoter seems to be stronger than the cab <dig> promoter although more transgenic lines were analysed for cab <dig> than for cab <dig> 

in order to analyse if the cab <dig> and cab <dig> promoters confer tissue specific expression to sugar beet, the roots of three transgenic cab <dig> and three cab <dig> promoter lines were analysed. according to the strength of the cab <dig> and cab <dig> promoters in leaves  transgenic lines were selected which show low, moderate or high gus activity in leaves. none of the lines showed gus activity in the roots which was above the background level of nontransgenic control plants . therefore the promoter activity of the cab <dig> and cab <dig> regulatory element is restricted to the above ground tissue of sugar beet and absent in roots. this result is consistent with the observations that transcripts of the cab genes are not detectable in the below ground tissue by northern blot hybridization .

to analyse cab <dig> and cab <dig> gene regulation in response to light, the reporter gene activtity of etiolated and green transgenic sugar beets was compared. in vitro shoots of the transgenic lines c1- <dig>  c1- <dig>  c2- <dig> and c2- <dig> were etiolated for  <dig> days in the dark. the gus activity of the etiolated leaflets of one half of the plants was determined. seven days after illumination the gus activity of the remaining plants was determined after greening of the leaves. in two independent experiments the cab <dig> and cab <dig> promoter plants showed a  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold and a  <dig> to  <dig> fold induction during greening, respectively . although the gus activity of the etiolated plants was comparable in the two assays, the greening plants showed a much stronger reporter gene activity in the second experiment. apparently, different time points during the differentiation of etioplasts to chloroplasts were analysed. time after illumination seems to have a strong influence on the level of promoter induction. furthermore, gene expression is much stronger in these experiments compared to the analysis in transgenic plants . finally, these results show that the cab <dig> and cab <dig> promoter are activated during the light induced plastid development.

the cab <dig> promoter lacks g-box elements with a palindromic acgt core sequence
gene expression is mainly regulated by the binding of transcription factors to specific cis-regulatory elements. because the two sugar beet promoters show a similar expression profile, it was investigated if there are any differences or similarities in the composition of cis-regulatory sequences in both promoters. towards these ends, a database-assisted approach was employed  <cit> . the patch™ program  <cit>  was used to inspect both promoter sequences for the occurence of plant transcription factor  binding sites that are annotated to the transfac® database  <cit> . the results reveal a large number of putative tf binding sites in both promoters . upon closer inspection of the results it was striking that the cab <dig> promoter, in contrast to the cab <dig> promoter was completely void of putative g-box like binding sites that contain a conserved acgt core sequence and are recognized by bzip transcription factors. using the program patch™ and entering a lower score boundary of 100% to detect only experimentally verified binding sites, only two putative binding sites for bzip transcription factors were found in the cab <dig> promoter. figure  <dig> shows the positions of these two motifs that both lack the acgt core sequence. the sequence motifs at position - <dig> and - <dig> relative to the translation start site were found in the rice glutelin-b <dig> promoter and are bound by the rice bzip transcription factor family risbz  <cit> . both sites were also found to be bound by the tobacco bzip transcription factor tga1a in a pea lectin promoter  <cit> .

inspecting the sequence of the cab <dig> promoter for the acgt core sequence of bzip factor binding sites reveals  <dig> positions for this motif . using the program patch™ six experimentally verified binding sites for bzip factors were detected among these twelve sites that harbor the acgt core in the cab <dig> promoter . the motif at position - <dig> is also present in the glutathione-s transferase  <dig> gene promoter of arabidopsis where it is bound by the factor obf <dig>  <cit> . the same site and the sites at position - <dig> and - <dig> occur in the embryonic abundant protein  <dig> promoter of rice and are recognized by the factors osbz <dig> and trab <dig>  <cit> . the sites at position - <dig> and - <dig> were recognized as bzip binding sites in many other systems. the sequence tgacgt is part of the as- <dig> element of the camv 35s promoter that was shown to be bound by tobacco tga1a, tga1b, and tga <dig>   <cit> . the site at position - <dig> is also present in the camv 35s promoter where it was shown to be bound by the wheat nuclear factor hbp- <dig>  <cit> .

the observation that the cab <dig> promoter lacks g-box like elements with a conserved acgt core sequence indicates that such sites are not required for leaf specific gene expression.

discussion
the chlorophyll a/b binding proteins cab <dig> and cab <dig> from sugar beet belong to the light harvesting complex i –  <dig> 
subtractive hybridization was used to isolate leaf expressed genes from sugar beet. the goal was the identification of a promoter that drives leaf specific gene expression in transgenic sugar beet plants. among seven analysed genes a cdna fragment corresponding to a chlorophyll a/b binding protein gene was shown by rna gel blot hybridization to be highly specific for green tissue . genomic dna blot hybridizations indicate that the two sugar beet genotypes investigated harbor either one or two copies of the gene designated bvcab <dig> and bvcab <dig> . a complete cdna for the gene from genotype 4b <dig> was isolated and encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids that shows the highest homology  to the cab <dig> gene from the light harvesting complex i  in tomato  <cit> . this and homologies to other lhci proteins indicate that the sugar beet gene belongs to the type iv lhci complex  <cit> . further support for this classification comes from the observation that the intron positions between cab <dig> from tomato and bvcab <dig> from sugar beet are identical .

lhci can be subdivided into at least two different chlorophyll-protein complexes, one of which appears to be responsible for the  <dig> nm fluorescence of psi  and the other complex  fluoresces at lower wavelength  <cit> . in barley the lhci- <dig> complex was isolated as a heterodimer composed of the type i and type iv polypeptides  <cit> . furthermore, tomato type i and type iv lhci polypeptides  expressed in e. coli form a heterodimer in vitro that closely resembles the native lhci- <dig> dimer from tomato leaves  <cit> . therefore, the sugar beet cab <dig> and cab <dig> proteins may be part of the lhci- <dig> complex.

g-box like elements are not a prerequisite for leaf specific gene expression
the promoters for both sugar beet cab genes were isolated and linked to reporter genes. transient gene expression studies in sugar beet indicated that  <dig> bp upstream of the atg from the bvcab <dig> gene and  <dig> bp upstream of the atg from the bvcab <dig> gene are sufficient for leaf specific gene expression in sugar beet .

promoter reporter gene constructs for bvcab <dig> and bvcab <dig> were stably transformed into sugar beet . in sugar beet both promoters are expressed in leaves .

when the promoter sequences of both cab genes where analysed for putative transcription factor binding sites, a striking difference was observed. the bvcab <dig> promoter lacks g-box like sequences with a palindromic acgt core. are g-boxes required for light or leaf specific gene expression? a  <dig> bp fragment of the wheat cab- <dig> promoter functions as a light responsive and organ specific enhancer in transgenic tobacco  <cit> . most notably the three regions that interact with nuclear factors and that were able to enhance gene expression of a  <dig> bp camv 35s minimal promoter did not contain a g-box sequence  <cit> . the requirement of g-box sequences for light specific gene expression has also been analysed directly  <cit> . a trimer of the g-box motif found in the spinach ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit- <dig> promoter was fused to a  <dig> bp camv 35s minimal promoter. while a mutant of this g-box did not confer gene expression to the minimal promoter in the dark and under different light conditions, the g-box increased reporter gene expression under these conditions  <cit> . reporter gene expression in the dark was comparably higher than under different light conditions. this is similar to the finding that a g-box like sequence in the cab1r gene of rice is necessary for high level transient expression of a reporter gene in tobacco leaf tissue  <cit> . taken together, this indicates that the presence of g-box sequences may have a quantitative effect but may not be a prerequisite for green tissue specific gene expression in sugar beet.

biotechnological applications of leaf specific promoters in sugar beet
the major goal of this work was the isolation of a strong leaf specific sugar beet promoter that can be used for biotechnological applications. disease control is one of the most important goals for biotechnological approaches towards improving sugar beet performance. there are many leaf spot diseases that are detrimental to the plant. for example, cercospora leaf spot is one of the most widespread and destructive foliar diseases of sugar beet  <cit> . expressing resistance improving genes in a strong and specific manner against pathogens causing foliar diseases may require a strong leaf specific promoter. with such a promoter, expression in taproots can be avoided which may otherwise take away available energy resources for sugar accumulation.

the work here shows that two promoters, bvcab <dig> and bvcab <dig>  have been isolated that drive highly leaf specific gene expression in sugar beet . no expression above background levels was detected for both promoters in sugar beet roots .

based on the expression strength in transgenic plants, the bvcab <dig> promoter may be suitable for biotechnological applications because it achieves a reporter gene activity comparable to the strong camv 35s promoter. camv 35s-mediated gus activities in transgenic tobacco plants were reported as  <dig> u  and  <dig> u  in which  <dig> unit refers to pmol 4-mu produced min- <dig> × mg protein- <dig>  <cit> .

the highest level of cab <dig> derived gus expression is  <dig> pmol mu x min- <dig> × mg- <dig> which is comparable with the expression strength of the strong camv 35s promoter in tobacco.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this work presents the isolation and expression analysis of two cab promoters from sugar beet. particularly, the bvcab <dig> promoter may be useful to drive strong and specific gene expression in transgenic host plants. the lack of bzip binding sites harboring the acgt core sequence could also be advantageous for transient analysis of bzip transcription factors when using a bvcab <dig> reporter gene construct as a transformation control. furthermore these promoters may be useful to express resistance improving genes against foliar diseases such as cercospora leaf spot.
