BACKGROUND
staphylococci, in particular methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , are the predominant cause of bone and joint infection. these infections cause serious morbidity and are often difficult to treat
 <cit> . recent evidence demonstrates that bacterially infected osteoblasts secrete chemokines and cytokines, suggesting that these cells are playing important role in combating localized infection through inflammation
 <cit> . the goal of this study was to evaluate mrsa infection mediated host responses, and the molecular mechanisms of host defenses. human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells  are known to support hematopoiesis to regenerate bone, cartilage and adipose tissues. thus hmscs possess complex biological functions which maintain the microenvironment of bone marrow. in addition, hmscs are well known for their immunoregulatory characteristics
 <cit> . they express pattern recognition receptors  which recognize pathogenic molecules. the prrs found in hmscs are toll like receptors 
 <cit> . there are currently  <dig> known mammalian tlrs of which tlr1- <dig> are functional in humans
 <cit> . tlrs are the family of conserved transmembrane receptors, which are expressed by a variety of immune cells, and non-immune cells including mesenchymal stem cells. tlrs recognize several conserved prrs like triacylated lipoprotein , diacylated lipoprotein , double stranded rna , lipopolysaccharide , flagellin , single stranded rna  and unmethylated dna  as well as viral and bacterial nucleic acids
 <cit> . activation of tlr by its ligand results in several biological outcomes ranging from secretion of cytokines, rapid cellular differentiation, apoptosis, and up regulation of antimicrobial activity
 <cit> . thus in the present study, we have used hmscs as our cell model to survey the expression of all known tlrs in response to mrsa co-culture condition which increased inflammation. activation of tlrs with mrsa ligands predominantly increased tlr  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> expression including transcription factor nr4a <dig>  and pro-inflammatory cytokines e.g. il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tnfα that altered normal function of hmscs cell biology.

the active form of vitamin d,  <dig> d <dig>  the secosteroid hormone that is well known for calcium homeostasis. the genomic action of this hormone is mediated by nuclear receptor-vitamin d receptor .  <dig> d <dig> deficiency causes rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. low  <dig> d <dig> is also linked to increased disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis, and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection
 <cit> . in addition tlr activation in human monocytes results in expression of the vitamin d receptor and vitamin d hydroxylase  and antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin expression that has direct antimicrobial activity against m. tuberculosis when co-incubated with the bacteria
 <cit> . like other nuclear receptors, vdr interacts with co-activators and co-repressors during the transcriptional cycle, and these interactions combine to determine histone modifications
 <cit> . thus it is well established that  <dig> d <dig> is an important modulator of immune system. however, the precise molecular mechanisms that are regulated by vdr following tlr induction are not well defined. in the present study, we sought to examine the ability of  <dig> d <dig> to modulate the mrsa mediated inflammatory response in hmscs.  <dig> d <dig> treatment followed by mrsa co-culture inhibit nuclear translocation of nf-кb-p <dig> and reduced cytokines  and nr4a <dig> expressions in hmscs. finally,  <dig> d <dig> activated vdr restores the global level of h3k9me <dig> to repress mrsa-stimulated inflammatory cytokine il- <dig> expression. in addition, 5-daza, an inhibitor of dna methylatransferases, reduces dna and histone methylation, enhances il- <dig> gene expression, furthermore, it dramatically re-expresses the  <dig> d3-mrsa-mediated silenced il- <dig> gene.

RESULTS
methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus -infection predominantly induces tlrs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> expressions in hmscs
in order to understand the differential tlrs members activated in hmscs due to mrsa infection, we treated in vitro cultured adherent hmscs with live mrsa as described in materials and methods. the tlrs mrna expression pattern was analyzed by semi quantitative rt-pcr, using validated human specific primers of tlr1- <dig> in response to co-cultured with or without mrsa in hmscs. we used in vitro cultured hmscs without any bacterial infection as our control treatment. three independent pcr run were done with hmscs isolated from three independent donors to check consistency of the tlr expression in control cells, before doing mrsa co-culture as treatment. as shown in figure 
 <dig>  the expression levels of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> mrnas in control hmscs  were consistently high. by contrast, low expression level of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> and no expression of tlr  <dig>  tlr  <dig>  and tlr  <dig> were detected in control hmscs, similar with the results obtained by liotta et al.
 <cit> . by contrast, we found that co-culture with live mrsa increased expression level of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  and tlr <dig> . we used u <dig> human macrophage cells as positive control for human tlrs mrna expressions with the same set of primers. the semi quantitative rt-pcr results of tlr mrna expressions  were further confirmed by quantitative real time pcr  . furthermore, mrsa treatment in hmscs also induced tlr proteins as confirmed western blotting . when tlrs are activated by its ligands in hmscs, it leads to activation of several known inflammatory pathways, synthesize and secrete cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. this activation can lead to changes of basic function of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells
 <cit> . in immune cells, tlr activation signal leads to secretion of a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines
 <cit> . we therefore hypothesized that mrsa mediated tlrs activation up regulate several inflammatory genes. we analyzed mrna expression of several cytokines by qpcr analysis from unstimulated or mrsa stimulated hmscs. in agreement with nf-κb activation in response to co-culture with mrsa in mscs, nf-κb-target pro-inflammatory cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnfα were significantly increased at the transcription level , supporting similar data obtained by lee et al.
 <cit> . figure 
1d indicates that nr4a <dig> transcript is up regulated with  <dig> hrs of mrsa infection in hmscs. this supports the clinical study that increased il- <dig> and nr4a <dig> expression is also associated with the development and clinical symptoms of human inflammatory arthritis
 <cit> . it was reported earlier that nr4a <dig> regulates the expression of various osteoblastic differentiation markers including osteopontin , a glycoprotein detected in several tissues in the body
 <cit> . interestingly, mrsa as tlr ligands stimulates opn transcripts while no change in collagen type i transcripts  were observed in hmscs . vdr is a nuclear receptor that mediates most known functions of  <dig> d <dig>  the active form of vitamin d
 <cit> . vdr forms heterodimers with rxr once vdr is activated by  <dig> d <dig>  vdr binds to the vitamin d response element in the target gene promoter to regulate gene transcription
 <cit> . interestingly, rt-pcr data indicated that mrsa up regulated vdr in hmscs . semi quantitative rt-pcr data  were further confirmed by qpcr sybr green assay . altogether our data indicated that tlr activation by mrsa play important roles in pathogenesis of these bacteria in hmscs. it was reported earlier that tlrs and their ligands control murine mscs function
 <cit> . to examine whether mrsa as tlr ligand has any effect on in vitro cultured hmscs biology, we co-cultured freshly isolated hmscs with and without mrsa and allowed to differentiate in osteogenic medium containing dexamethasone for  <dig> days. in figure 
1f, control cells  at day  <dig>  strongly stimulated bone nodule formation with dexamethasone treatment as shown by microscopic representative image . however, the presence of mrsa totally abolished hmscs matrix calcification as measured by alizarin red staining and alkaline phosphatase  assay. no nodule formation was observed in mrsa co-cultured hmscs . cell proliferation assay was done at every  <dig> days interval, with draq <dig>  a fluorescent dye that stain dna inside the cells . it was observed that, control cells stopped proliferating and started forming nodule after day  <dig>  however, mrsa co-culture enhanced proliferation in hmscs and failed to differentiate into osteoblasts until day  <dig> . as expected, expression of cells proliferation marker cyclin d <dig> remains elevated until 12- <dig> days of mrsa infection in hmscs compared to control as shown by western blot analysis . thus, our data indicate the incomplete differentiation potential of hmscs due to extracellular s. aureus infection.

mrsa-induced nuclear nf-κb activity is inhibited by  <dig> d <dig> in hmscs
it has been shown that in immune cells, tlr activation is linked to activation of nf-кb dimer, a transcription factor consisting of p <dig> and p <dig> subunits, which enters the nucleus and regulates transcription of target genes
 <cit> . in order to investigate whether tlrs expressed on hmscs are functional, the outcome of tlr agonists-mediated tlr activation was performed using nf-κb nuclear localization by western blot as a read-out of its activation. human mscs were stimulated with mrsa as tlr ligands for increasing time points and subsequent nuclear and cytosolic fractionations studies were performed for western blot analysis for nf-κb-p <dig>  in un-stimulated cells without any mrsa stimulation, nf-κb-p <dig> was localized mainly in cytoplasm . as shown in figure 
2a-b, co-culture with mrsa induced nf-κb-p <dig> translocation to nucleus from cytosol within an hour and remains elevated in nucleus until  <dig> h of infection in hmscs. this data further supporting the notion of functional status of tlrs signals which activate nf-κb transcription factor in human bone marrow-derived mscs. reduced  <dig> d <dig> intake or  <dig> d <dig> deficiency linked to susceptibility to s. aureus infection.  <dig> d <dig> is also well established for inhibiting inflammatory signals by inhibiting nf-κb activity in adipocytes
 <cit> . in figure 
1b we also observed that tlr activation by mrsa increased vdr transcript. so we further investigated the effect of  <dig> d <dig> on nuclear translocation of the p <dig> subunit of nf-κb by western blot analysis in hmscs. our data indicated that pretreatment of hmscs with  <dig> nm of  <dig> d <dig> for  <dig> hrs followed by mrsa stimulation for  <dig> hrs almost completely blocked nf-κb-p <dig> nuclear translocation . to determine whether nf-κb-p <dig>  vdr and nr4a <dig> could bind to the mrsa stimulated transcription complex in vivo, we performed immunoprecipitation assay. human mscs were stimulated with or without mrsa for  <dig> hrs and nuclear protein was used to perform immunoprecipitation with nf-κb-p <dig> rabbit polyclonal antibody. our data indicated that nf-κb-p <dig>  vdr and nr4a <dig> were present in the same nuclear protein complex , indicating that vdr is an active part of the nuclear protein complexes for transcriptional regulation
 <cit> .

inhibitory effect of  <dig> d <dig> on mrsa-stimulated inflammatory cytokines mrna expressions in hmscs
interestingly, earlier studies have shown that  <dig> d <dig> can suppress the release of tnf-α
 <cit> , the expression of il- <dig> in human periodontal ligament cells stimulated with porphyromonas gingivalis, associated with chronic periodontitis
 <cit> , lps-stimulated il- <dig> protein and mrna synthesis in two human adipocyte models via interference with nf-κb signaling
 <cit> . moreover,  <dig> d <dig> effectively up-regulates the synthesis of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig> and induces il- <dig> receptor expression in vitro <cit> . in contrast,  <dig> d <dig> deficiency increases tnf-α levels in healthy women
 <cit> . in order to examine whether  <dig> d <dig> pretreatment down regulate mrsa-mediated inflammatory responses in hmscs, we pretreated  <dig> nm of  <dig> d <dig> for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hrs, followed by mrsa co-culture for another  <dig> hrs. real-time quantitative pcr was performed with human specific primers of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnf-α, nr4a <dig>  vdr, cathelicidin using sybr green assay. our results showed that mrsa mediated inflammatory responses up regulated vdr expression , furthermore,  <dig> d <dig> pretreatment inhibits mrsa-stimulated il- <dig>  il- <dig> transcripts in a time dependent manner . tnf-α and nr4a <dig> transcripts are inhibited within  <dig> hrs of  <dig> d <dig> pretreatment . pretreatment with  <dig> d <dig> followed by mrsa co-culture caused time dependent increase of cathelicidin transcript .  <dig> d <dig> pretreatment to control hmscs  has no effect on tnf-α and nr4a <dig> transcripts . taken together,  <dig> d <dig> was able to significantly reduce mrsa-induced il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnf-α and nr4a <dig> mrna expressions in hmscs. this effect was observed both at concomitant incubation with mrsa and  <dig> d <dig> together  and pretreatment with  <dig> d <dig> followed by mrsa co-culture in hmscs. furthermore, mrsa infection in hmscs induced many pro-inflammatory cytokines protein expression, such as tnf-α, and il- <dig>  and their secretion into the culture medium .

interestingly, pretreatment with  <dig> d <dig> followed by mrsa co-culture in hmscs significantly blocked secretion of il- <dig>  and tnf-α proteins .

 <dig> d <dig> affect the global level of histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> trimethylation  to repress mrsa-stimulated il- <dig> transcription
 <dig> d <dig>  a hormonally active form of vitamin d <dig>  is a repressive signal that binds to and activates the nuclear vitamin d receptor 
 <cit> . a basic helix–loop–helix transcriptional activator  regulates the transcription of cyp27b <dig> by the negative  <dig> d <dig> response element 
 <cit> . heterodimers of  <dig> d3-bound vdr and retinoid x receptor  repress the activation of vdir that is bound upon the nvdre by means of the histone deacetylase  co-repressor complex
 <cit> . the dna methyltrasferase  interacted with both vdr and vdir in a ligand-dependent manner. indeed, treatment with  <dig> d <dig> induced dna methylation at cpg sites in the promoter and exon regions of the cyp27b <dig> gene
 <cit> . it has been shown that h3k <dig> methylation promotes dna methylation and serve as a critical mark for dna methylation and gene silencing
 <cit> . methylation of lysines h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> are correlated with transcriptional repression
 <cit> . particularly, h3k9me <dig> is highly correlated with constitutive heterochromatin
 <cit> . angrisano et al.
 <cit>  reported that lps induces early histone h <dig> methylation and acetylation changes at the promoter region of il- <dig> gene in ht- <dig>  a human intestinal epithelial cell line. thus,  <dig> d <dig> may regulate expression of genes by epigenetic modifications of dna and histones. in order to understand the molecular mechanisms how  <dig> d <dig> preincubation inhibiting inflammation, we tested effect of  <dig> d <dig>  an active chromatin modulator, on the global level of histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> trimethylation  in hmscs, with or without mrsa-co-cultured conditions. interestingly, we found that  <dig> d <dig> pretreatment alone or mrsa–stimulation alone remarkably reduces global level of h3k9me <dig> compared to the control in hmscs . furthermore,  <dig> d <dig> pretreatment followed by mrsa-stimulation restored global level of h3k9me <dig> compared to the control in hmscs . acetylation of lysine  <dig> on histone h <dig>  has been linked to gene activation and active transcription
 <cit> . we have also tested the global level of h3k9ac in this condition in hmscs cell extracts. interestingly, we found that  <dig> d <dig> pretreatment alone doesn’t affect the global level of h3k9ac, however, mrsa–stimulation alone remarkably induced global level of h3k9ac compared to the control hmscs . further,  <dig> d <dig> pretreatment followed by mrsa-stimulation did not affect the global level of h3k9ac compared to the mrsa-stimulation alone in hmscs . similar with earlier report
 <cit> , mrsa-stimulation showed dramatic induction of cox- <dig> protein , nr4a <dig>  vdr  and  <dig> d <dig> pretreatment followed by mrsa-stimulation dramatically reduced cox- <dig>  nr4a <dig> protein levels in hmscs .

5-deoxy-azacytidine , an epigenetic drug that inhibits dna methyltransferases  inhibits dna methylation and often is used in vitro to induce the re-expression of genes putatively silenced by promoter methylation
 <cit> . in order to test whether inhibiting methylation event with 5-daza, inhibits dna methylation and histone methylation, as a result can re-express the  <dig> d3-mrsa-mediated silenced pro-inflammatory il- <dig> gene. in order to demonstrate whether  <dig> d3-mrsa silencing cytokines expression is universal we have used human embryonic kidney cells, hek <dig> cells for the d-aza experiments. interestingly, we found that in hek <dig> cells, 5-daza treatment reduces dna and histone methylation, enhances il- <dig> gene expression, furthermore, it dramatically re-expresses the  <dig> d3-mrsa-mediated silenced il- <dig> gene . similar data also obtained in hmscs . altogether, our data supporting the notion that  <dig> d3-activated vdr is an epigenetic regulator and may inhibits synthesis of cytokines in mrsa-stimulated infection by restoring the global level of h3k9me <dig>  a histone h <dig> mark for gene silencing.

discussion
human mesenchymal stem cells  are known to maintain regeneration of mesodermal tissue throughout the life time of an individual, which is dependent on the balance between the ability to differentiate into specialized cell types and self-renew. excess self-renew and over differentiation may lead to mutation or tumorigenesis
 <cit> . as hmscs are also well known for their immunomodulatory functions, it is important to understand the factors playing role in the recognition of pathogens, which can lead to substantial changes in basic cellular functions. so far the only pathogen recognition receptors found in hmscs are toll like receptors . identification of tlr expression patterns which are associated with recognition of specific microbial molecules is critical to understand pathogen-host interactions. in our study, we used staphylococcus , a common pathogen of human body. staphylococcus in particular; staphylococcus aureus is the predominant cause of bone infections. staphylococcal bone infections are thus increasing concern and understanding of the interaction of these pathogens with the bone is central to the development of the novel therapeutic strategies required to treat increasing antibiotic resistant and persistent infections. our study revealed that expression levels of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> mrnas in control hmscs  were consistently high. by contrast, low expression level of tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> and no expression of tlr  <dig>  tlr  <dig>  and tlr  <dig> were detected in control hmscs, similar with the results obtained by liotta et al.
 <cit> . further confirmation of tlr response with validated human specific qpcr primers of tlrs revealed that in response to co-culture with live mrsa increased mrna expression of tlr  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in hmscs. in addition to inflammatory responses, tlrs have been shown to directly regulate cell survival and cellular proliferation in a variety of biological settings
 <cit> . the tlrs which are found to express in control cells, are may be involved for normal cell survival and proliferation. in agreement, as reported earlier by bandow et al.
 <cit> , we have shown that activation of tlrs in response to mrsa co-culture completely suppressed osteoblast differentiation and increased cell proliferation. increased il- <dig> and nr4a <dig> are associated with inflammatory arthritis
 <cit> . nr4a <dig> sub family has emerged as potential regulators of cytokines and growth factor action through regulating the inflammatory response underlying several diseases. nr4a <dig> is rapidly and potentially induced by a range of cytokines, suggesting that these receptors act as potential transcriptional mediators of inflammatory signals
 <cit> . we have tested several inflammatory genes expression in mrsa-mediated infection condition in hmscs. we found that when hmscs were co-culture with mrsa resulted in up regulation of il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnfα, nr4a <dig>  vdr, and opn transcripts. osteopontin  is expressed by several tissues, regulated by several signaling pathways and transcription factors that are associated with cancer progression
 <cit> . within bone tissue opn plays a key role in cell adhesion, migration and survival. as il- <dig> is the target gene for nr4a <dig>  our data support the notion that nr4a <dig> could be a critical regulator of those gene involved in proliferation in infection-mediated tlr-activated hmscs. interestingly, we found that vdr expression is very high after treating hmscs with mrsa. in our study we observed that hmscs without any mrsa infection form distinct nodules and exhibited alp activity and de novo formation of extracellular calcium deposition , which is consistent with the previous observations found in control murine mscs
 <cit> . however, mrsa infection fully blocked extracellular calcium deposition and alp staining , while it promotes hmscs proliferation . this indicated clearly a shift of hmscs to self-renewal rather differentiation due to extracellular mrsa infection.

in immune cells, tlrs ligands activate downstream signaling and translocate nf-κb-p <dig>  a key transcription factor, to the nucleus for synthesis of its target genes include inflammatory cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and tnfα
 <cit> . recently, it has been implicated in human inflammatory joint disease; nuclear protein nr4a <dig> cooperatively interacted with nf-kb-p <dig> at the il- <dig> promoter for its transcriptional activation with tnfα
 <cit> . it has long been known that  <dig> d <dig> exert its anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting nf-kb-p <dig> activity. therefore,  <dig> d <dig> suppression of nf-κb activation has great biological and pathological relevance. however, it remains to be determined how vitamin d receptor  is directly involved in the regulation of the nf-κb pathway. chen et al.
 <cit> , reported that vdr physically interact with ikb kinase to block nf-κb activation. in dendritic cells,  <dig> d <dig> inhibits il- <dig> expression through targeting the nfκb pathway
 <cit> ; by directly suppresses relb transcription
 <cit> . in addition, it was reported that epigenetic regulation is essential to nf-kb-p <dig> transcriptional activity via lysine methylation
 <cit> . we also found that pretreatment of hmscs with  <dig> d <dig> followed by mrsa stimulation significantly blocked nf-κb-p <dig> nuclear translocation and inflammatory cytokines synthesis. further, nf-κb-p <dig>  vdr and nr4a <dig> were present in the same nuclear protein complex, indicating that vdr is an active part of the nuclear protein complexes for transcriptional regulation.

the actions of  <dig> d <dig> are mediated by the vdr, a transcription factor that belongs to nuclear hormone receptor superfamily
 <cit> . previous research showed that binding of  <dig> d <dig> to vdr in the cytoplasm of cells stimulates heterodimerization of vdr with rxr and the redistribution of the vdr-rxr-hormone complex to the nucleus
 <cit> . recently, it has been reported that vdr and many other nuclear receptors such as nr4a <dig> interacts with coactivators and corepressors during the transcriptional cycle
 <cit> . saijo et al.
 <cit>  has reported the involvement of nr4a2-corest corepressor complex signaling pathway in neuro-inflammation, which further explain the regulatory role of vdr-nf-kb-nr4a <dig> in inflammation.

the vdr, such as many other nuclear receptors, interacts with coactivators and corepressors during the transcriptional cycle
 <cit>  has reported recently, anti-inflammatory role of nr4a2-corest corepressor complex signaling pathway in neuro-inflammation, which further the regulatory role of vdr-nf-kb-nr4a <dig> in inflammation. several related recent observations revealed that vdr-corepressor complexes could also repress transcription of genes in a ligand-dependent manner through epigenetic modification of dna methylation and histone methylation in the gene promoter regions
 <cit> . binding of ncor <dig> at a specific vdr binding site was associated with the loss of h3k9ac and gain of h3k9me <dig> and h3k27me3
 <cit> . methylation of lysines h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> is correlated with transcriptional repression
 <cit> , particularly; h3k9me <dig> is highly correlated with constitutive heterochromatin
 <cit> , associated with cpg methylation
 <cit> , a histone mark for transcription repression. given that h3k9me levels can attract the machinery that drives dna cpg methylation, we test whether inhibiting methylation event with 5-daza, inhibits dna methylation and histone methylation can re-express the  <dig> d3-mrsa-mediated silenced inflammatory gene. our data indicated for the first time that  <dig> d <dig> pre-treatment followed by mrsa treatment restored h3k9me <dig> levels, and blocked synthesis of cytokines. in addition, 5-daza treatment reduces dna and histone methylation, enhances il- <dig> gene expression, furthermore, it dramatically re-expresses the  <dig> d3-mrsa-mediated silenced il- <dig> gene . our study revealed an interrelated set of factors that explain the epigenetic mechanism of ligand bound vdr to inhibit the synthesis of cytokines. it is tempted to speculate that  <dig> d3-vdr-nr4a <dig> mediated global epigenetic mechanisms may directly regulate nf-kb-p <dig> translocation to the nucleus and epigenetically modulate targeted cytokine promoters for transcriptional inhibition. however further confirmation is required by detail studies whether vdr mediated epigenetic modification is on global transcription factors on cytokine promoters or nf-κb-p <dig> chaperoned by vdr and nr4a <dig> recruitment to the targeted gene promoters.

CONCLUSIONS
altogether, our data explain that tlr  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> can be used as markers for localized staphylococcus bone infection and supporting the notion that  <dig> d <dig> has potential role in inhibition of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus -stimulated infection mediated inflammation by inhibiting il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnf-α and nr4a <dig> transcripts in hmscs.  <dig> d <dig> inhibits translocation of nf-kb-p <dig>  an important transcription factor for inflammation, to the nucleus, indicating its anti-inflammatory role in hmscs. further, we also partly demonstrated that  <dig> d3−vdr is an epigenetic regulator and may exhibit its anti-inflammatory properties by restoring transcription repression histone methylation mark .  <dig> d <dig> may inhibit synthesis of cytokines by restoring histone methylation at the gene promoters. further studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of  <dig> d3-activated vdr epigenetic mechanism inhibited synthesis of cytokines in mrsa-stimulated infection by restoring the global level of h3k9me <dig>  a histone h <dig> mark for gene silencing.
