BACKGROUND
a promoter region of an eukaryotic protein-encoding gene usually consists of a core promoter region of around  <dig> bp nucleotides adjacent to the transcription initiation site, and multiple distal dna regulatory elements to control transcription efficiency. there are several key genetic elements within a core promoter: the tata box, an initiator element, the downstream promoter element usually found in tata-less promoters, and the tfiib-recognition element  <cit> . the tata boxes are usually located about  <dig> to  <dig> bp upstream of the transcription start site , while the less conserved initiator elements span the tss. these sequences contribute to an accurate transcription initiation and to the tata-containing promoters strength. in arabidopsis core promoters, the tata box is located between - <dig> and - <dig> relative to the tss and, instead of the initiator element around the tss, the yr rule  applies to most of them. another element is the pyrimidine patch , although its role is still unknown. these three elements are orientation-sensitive  <cit> . other promoter elements found in arabidopsis and rice are regulatory element groups , which appear upstream of the tata box , and exist in an orientation-insensitive manner  <cit> .

transcription initiation by rna polymerase ii is unidirectional from most genes. however, several reports indicate that divergent transcription is likely a common feature for active promoters  <cit> .

divergent genes, defined as non-overlapping genes organized head-to-head in opposite orientation, represent a  <dig> % of the total gene pairs when separated by less than  <dig> kb in the arabidopsis genome  <cit> . nevertheless, there is scarce evidence on functional analyses of the intergenic regions between those gene pairs. previous findings of head-to-head oriented genes sharing an intergenic region with putative bidirectional promoters were reported in brassica napus  <cit> , capsicum annuum  <cit> , and by computational analysis in rice, arabidopsis, and black cottonwood  <cit> . large-scale studies of expression data in arabidopsis revealed that neighbouring genes in the genome are co-expressed  <cit> , and that the lengths of the intergenic sequences have opposite effects on the ability of a gene to be epigenetically regulated for differential expression  <cit> . two recent papers have shown activity of larger intergenic regions in rice  and arabidopsis , functioning as bidirectional promoters of chymotrypsin protease inhibitor  <cit>  and chlorophyll a/b-binding protein  <cit>  genes, respectively. these systems were assessed in a heterologous background using onion epidermal cells  <cit> , and also in stable transgenic plants, the latter intended to be used for genetic engineering-based crop improvement  <cit> .

all divergent gene pairs are potential sources of bidirectional promoters. to define the function of the corresponding intergenic regions and their transcriptional regulation is of great interest for plant molecular biologists.

in this study, a divergent promoter of a protein-encoding gene pair  with an intergenic region of  <dig> bp was analyzed. the at5g <dig> and at5g <dig> loci encode a 2-cys peroxiredoxin b , which are a chloroplast-located protein  <cit> , and a protein of unknown function , respectively . the 2-cys peroxiredoxins are proteins involved in redox processes, and their functions are related to the antioxidant defence of the plant  <cit> , photosynthesis, abiotic stress response, and possibly chloroplast-to-cytosol signalling  <cit> . in yeast, peroxiredoxins could act as molecular chaperons, increasing resistance to heat stress  <cit> . the expression pattern of the at5g <dig> and at5g <dig> was tested by fusing the intergenic region in opposite orientation to β-glucuronidase  reporter gene during the development and growth of arabidopsis plants as well as during stress situations.

RESULTS
functional analysis of the intergenic region between at5g <dig> and at5g <dig> in arabidopsis plants during their development and growth
to test functionality of the intergenic region shared by the divergent genes at5g <dig> and at5g <dig> during arabidopsis life cycle, the dna fragment was fused to gus in both orientations . accordingly, we cloned a  <dig> bp dna fragment  upstream of gus in the binary vector pbi <dig> . the constructs were introduced into wild-type arabidopsis plants by floral dip, multiple transgenic plants were obtained, and more than  <dig> independent lines were examined for each construct throughout development. gus staining was performed in arabidopsis plants during life cycle . interestingly, prom280:gus plants have shown staining almost exclusively in the petiole and vascular bundle of midrib in all the leaves , sepals , but not in the cotyledons , while prom290:gus plants have shown staining mainly in the leaf mesophyll , sepals , and siliques . it is worth noticing that stronger gus staining was observed for prom290:gus plants  in comparison with prom280:gus plants at all growth stages . results indicate that the intergenic region between at5g <dig> and at5g <dig> directs gus expression in a spatially exclusive manner depending on the promoter orientation during arabidopsis development and growth .

as 2cpb is a chloroplastic protein  <cit> , we analyzed the putative intracellular location of puf using chlorop  <dig>  server  <cit>  and the deduced amino acid sequence of at5g <dig>  the prediction results have shown that puf  is likely to be a plastidic protein, because it has an amino-terminal extension indicative of chloroplast transit peptide . for comparison, 2cpb score was  <dig>  using this web tool.

response of prom280:gus and prom290:gus plants to various stresses
different stress conditions lead to the production of reactive oxygen species  as a consequence of membrane and protein damage  <cit> . the expression of 2-cys peroxiredoxins are reported to be redox regulated  <cit> . therefore, it was decided to test the response of prom280:gus and prom290:gus plants to various environmental stresses. firstly, the effect of temperature treatment in 10-day old arabidopsis seedlings was analyzed. plants of both transgenic lines were incubated for  <dig> h at 37°c or 4°c and, after the treatment, they were submitted to gus staining procedure. figure  <dig> shows that leaves from both plant lines were stained stronger under heat stress , maintaining the same tissue specificity to the control condition . in addition, the root tips were stained in the case of prom290:gus plants . in both plant lines the gus staining pattern was conserved under cold stress , although the expression levels were weaker than control conditions as revealed by quantification of the gus staining intensity . furthermore, no expression was detected in the plants carrying the vector without the intergenic region  . further analysis of puf and 2cpb expression using the response viewer of genevestigator software  <cit>  is presented in figure  <dig>  under several cold treatments, the aerial part of arabidopsis plants have evidenced decreased expression of puf and 2cpb, while under heat conditions, the plants have evidenced enhanced expression of both genes . similar responses were observed in the expression of gus in prom280:gus and prom290:gus plants submitted to temperature stress . additionally, in roots of prom290:gus plants, the expression of 2cpb is markedly increased by heat stress , which is consistent with data obtained from roots under the same stress treatment .

to confirm the effect of heat treatment on the induction of 2cpb, 10-day old wild-type arabidopsis plants were submitted for  <dig> days at 37°c, and the total protein of leaves and roots were extracted and analyzed by sds-page and immunoblotting. results are presented in additional file  <dig>  the total protein pattern has shown slight differences between control and treated plants in the leaf or root tissues, especially in higher molecular masses larger than  <dig> kda. immunoblot analysis of these tissues has shown induction of 2cpb in both leaves and roots after heat treatment . these data indicate that heat treatment was able to increase not only 2cpb protein level in root and leaf of wild-type plants , but also gus activity in the same tissues as observed in prom290:gus plants .

other sources of ros are biotic and abiotic stresses. the effect of different stress conditions on the expression levels of prom280:gus and prom290:gus plants were evaluated, and the results are presented in figure  <dig>  gus expression was similarly reduced in both arabidopsis lines under oxidative stress caused by methyl viologen , a redox cycling compound, fungal elicitor, and mannitol. additionally, gus expression was down-regulated by high light and nacl in prom280:gus lines, while in prom290:gus lines were unaffected. it is worth mentioning that the expression of gus in prom280:gus lines was ten times lower than in prom290:gus plants when calculated per mg of protein of the aerial parts of the plant. this could be due to a dilution effect of gus activity specifically located in vascular bundles of the leaf in prom280:gus lines, in comparison with the whole leaf expression pattern of gus in prom290:gus plants.

these results suggest that puf and 2cpb are stress-responsive genes, although they are not always affected in the same way by the same stress conditions.

in search of cis-elements in the promoter of puf and 2cpb
in silico analysis of the divergent promoter was performed looking for cis-elements using the plant promoter database   <cit> , plantcare  <cit> , place  <cit> , and athamap  <cit>  web tools. analysis revealed no tata box available. the elements distribution in the  <dig> bp region is shown in figure  <dig>  we identified binding sites for four homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factors: athb <dig>  which was reported to be involved in differentiation of the palisade mesophyll cells and leaf development  <cit> ; athb <dig>  which is responsive to far-red light  <cit> ; athb <dig>  which is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of light-dependent developmental phenomena  <cit> ; and transcription factors similar to zmhox2a, which have the homeodomains zmhox2a and zmhox2a  <cit> . furthermore, a y patch near puf tss, and seven regs near 2cpb tss were identified; however, their functions are still unknown. an aaca element, which was described as a negative regulatory element in vascular promoters that represses activity in other cell types  <cit> , were identified in seven positions. lastly, a ccaat box, present in the promoter of heat shock protein  genes  <cit> , was found four times, and the ncttn element present in the promoters of several hsp genes  <cit>  was found  <dig> times. this analysis displayed no other overrepresented cis-element in the promoter region under study.

distribution of distances between genes and their nearest neighbours in arabidopsis genome
to further characterize this  <dig> bp promoter on genome-wide scale, the distribution of intergenic regions of similar lengths into the arabidopsis genome was studied. for that purpose, the distribution of distances between arabidopsis genes and their nearest neighbours in the same and opposite strands were explored. the distances between the tss of the nearest gene neighbours for each of the  <dig>  genes predicted  after filtering out genes annotated as pseudogenes and transposons were calculated. the distribution of distances between 5'ends of genes on opposite strands is bimodal, which could be deconvoluted in two peaks centred at  <dig> bp  and  <dig>  kbp . this type of distribution was not present in all the around  <dig>  genes with the nearest neighbours on the same strand , or when the distances were calculated between the 3'ends of the genes on opposite strands . noticeably, only  <dig> % of the gene pairs with 5'ends on the same strand are closer than  <dig>  bp , while 75% of the gene pairs with 3'ends on opposite strands are closer than  <dig>  bp, with  <dig>  of them having overlapping regions . we designated the region between the two non-overlapping 5'ends of genes located on opposite strands as a putative bidirectional promoter. this analysis shows that out of  <dig>  divergent gene pairs ,  <dig>  are putative bidirectional promoters of less than  <dig>  bp in the arabidopsis genome. most of the head-to-head oriented genes  have predictably shown non-overlapping bidirectional promoters, and only  <dig>  gene pairs are less than  <dig> bp in length.

discussion
with the availability of complete genome sequences for a number of organisms, functionality of intergenic regions has attracted more attention. computational analysis has shown that divergent gene pairs with intergenic regions less than  <dig> kb are quite abundant in the sequenced eukaryotic genomes of both plants and animals  <cit> . the interest in studying intergenic region functionality is increasing not only to better understand divergent transcription, but also to use them as a new toolkit to manipulate genomes  <cit> . in plants, particularly, very few reports about this matter are available. an example of such investigations in plants in which data from computational assistance and bidirectionalization were integrated to construct a synthetic transcriptional unit for high-level reporter-gene expression in response to specific elicitors was reported, thus yielding exciting results  <cit> . in this study, it has been found that the region shared by two divergent genes in the chromosome  <dig> of arabidopsis thaliana  functions as a promoter in both orientations. in addition, this study was able to demonstrate that tissue and developmental expression patterns differed between puf and 2cpb. head-to-head genes from other organisms such as human, mouse, and rat genomes statistically tend to perform similar functions, and gene pairs associated with the significant co-functions seem to have stronger expression correlations  <cit> . in this case, the gene products of at5g <dig> and at5g <dig> are both presumably located in the chloroplasts, although it is unknown if their functions are related. thus, it is known that 2cpb is located in the chloroplasts and prevents oxidative damage of chloroplast proteins  <cit> . the transcript increase of 2cpb was correlated with chlorophyll distribution and also accumulated in plants with decreased catalase activity and upon heat stress  <cit> . down-regulation of 2cpb was observed upon pathogen infection, ozone and cold  <cit> . instead, the role of puf remains unknown until today, and presumably it would be a chloroplast-located protein as predicted by chlorop analysis  <cit> .

when searching for at5g <dig> and at5g <dig> potential orthologues, it has been found that this head-to-head gene organization was not conserved among other genomes ; pointing out that most probably their gene products are not functionally related. in humans, analysis of genome-wide expression data demonstrated that a minority of bidirectional gene pairs are expressed through a mutually exclusive mechanism  <cit> . in this study, the tissue-specific expression of both genes directed by the divergent promoter has shown unidirectional activity for puf in petiole and vascular bundles and unidirectional activity in the opposite direction in different tissues for 2cpb. the higher expression of 2cpb in the leaf mesophyll, but not in vascular bundles, is coincident with its function in the redox processes of chloroplasts  <cit> . taken together, these results suggest that the directionality of the promoter activity may be regulated to some degree in a tissue-specific manner. in fact, a cis-motif associated to vascular bundle expression   <cit>  was found several times in the puf direction of transcription.

furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the divergent promoter shared by puf and 2cpb responded to temperature stress. in relation to this, the higher 2cpb levels in the leaf and root caused by heat treatment of arabidopsis seedlings would indicate a role of this protein in temperature stress. in yeast, peroxiredoxins could alternatively function as peroxidases and molecular chaperons, increasing resistance to heat stress  <cit> . it is well known that exposure of plants to high temperature leads to the production of hsps. the yeast heat shock factor  <dig> binding sequence nttcn   <cit>  was found highly represented in the intergenic region of this study. therefore, it is tempting to speculate that high temperature could stimulate 2cpb similarly to hsp genes. remarkably, the puf expression was repressed similarly to 2cpb by several stress conditions.

in silico analysis of this promoter using ppdb revealed that it is a tata-less promoter in both orientations. in plant genomes putative bidirectional promoters have tata boxes underrepresented  <cit> . a recent study  <cit>  suggested that tata box-containing genes have longer intergenic upstream regions and increased variation across species because their upstream regulatory potential is greater and, therefore, more amenable to change and modulation. the tata box appears to be responsible for promoter unidirectionality in most cases, whereas having no tata boxes appears to be a novel mechanism of regulation by bidirectional promoters compared to unidirectional promoters. this analysis also revealed that in a short region of this promoter  , four different cis-elements are overlapped. they are: one heat shock element , a y patch found in the majority of arabidopsis promoters but with unknown function  <cit> , and three binding sites of homeodomains-leucine zipper transcription factors, some of them being able to bind in both directions  <cit> . these cis-elements would be leading the transcription of 2cpb, specially athb <dig>  which is involved in differentiation of the palisade mesophyll cells, and athb <dig>  which in turn is involved in the control of leaf morphology development  <cit> . upstream of this region there are three aaca elements in the +/-  <dig> bp region of puf tss . this is a negative regulatory element in vascular promoters, which represses activity in other cell types  <cit>  suggesting that, in the intergenic region under analysis, this cis-element would be preventing puf transcription in mesophilic cells. the expression of puf in vascular bundle of midribs could be activated by athb <dig>  which has a homeodomain too, and by the y patch that is located in the  <dig> bp region above mentioned. the 2cpb and puf putative promoter regions mentioned have an element of response to heat near them, which could explain the heat stress experiments. it was not possible to find any abiotic stress element overrepresented in the  <dig> bp region analyzed, suggesting that the expression pattern observed in figure  <dig> could be the result of the complex interaction of the transcription factors that bind the  <dig> bp region. overall, results obtained from this study indicate that the multiple stress responsiveness of the intergenic region would reside within the  <dig> bp.

when length is considered, the short promoter shared by 2cpb and puf belongs to a minority group of putative bidirectional promoters present in the arabidopsis genomes. in fact, arabidopsis genome has a bimodal distribution of distances between the 5'ends of genes on opposite strands, peaking the smaller group of gene pairs at  <dig> bp. this is the first intergenic region functionally studied of this small group of arabidopsis promoters. plants are sessile organisms and, during their growth, they occasionally are affected by adverse environmental conditions; therefore, they may rely more strongly on elaborate transcriptional response programs to survive. then, it is highly possible that other intergenic regions of similar lengths and regulatory features could be found in plants.

CONCLUSIONS
in this report, it has been shown that a  <dig> bp intergenic region between head-to-head oriented at5g <dig> and at5g <dig> directs genes expression in different arabidopsis tissues in a mutually exclusive manner. gene products of these loci are a chloroplast-located 2-cys peroxiredoxin b involved in the antioxidant defence, and a protein of unknown function. this is the first report of an intergenic region that drives expression of a gene involved in the chloroplast antioxidant defence. these results also show that 2cpb is induced by heat stress in the leaves and roots, suggesting a function for this protein in the heat stress defensive system of arabidopsis thaliana.
