BACKGROUND
the 'omic' revolution is starting to have a profound impact on the investigation of complex diseases. this technology promises a more rational approach to the treatment of disease as a consequence of the development of new molecular diagnostic tests. these "biomarkers" will impact many areas of the clinical management of disease, including screening patients at risk, classifying patients at presentation, selection of appropriate therapy, monitoring response to treatment, and predicting relapse.

the best example of the application of this technology has been in the field of oncology. here, microarray-based expression profiling has been widely employed to develop clinically relevant molecular classifiers for many tumour types  <cit> . these classifiers have a better prognostic performance than conventional classifiers based on clinical parameters  <cit> , and can predict both the response to therapy  <cit> , and the odds of metastasis development  <cit> . the choice of tissue to profile is straightforward in oncology and the whole process is greatly simplified by the fact that tumour material is largely monoclonal. for systemic autoimmune diseases the choice of material to profile is less clear. from a practical perspective the best option is to profile peripheral blood cells, an approach that has been pursued by several groups  <cit> .

in these early studies, however, the results have been confounded by the use of unseparated peripheral blood mononuclear cells , as many of the expression signatures identified, as well as representing potential changes in cell-type specific gene expression, may simply reflect changes in the cellular constituents of blood. perhaps the best example of this is the "granulopoiesis" signature identified by bennett and colleagues, which reflected the fact that patient, but not control, pbmc samples contained significant numbers of immature granulocytes  <cit> . in the same study the authors also demonstrated an increase in the expression of immunoglobulin genes in some patients  <cit> . this was also shown to be correlated with the increased number of circulating plasmablasts in these patients  rather that a change in b cell gene transcription at the cellular level.

to avoid this issue it would be preferable to profile populations of purified cells, but the conditions for performing such cell separations and subsequent analyses are not well established. in particular, it is unclear whether positive or negative selection is best employed for generating purified cells for profiling. it has long been a criticism of positive selection that cross-linking cell surface antigens may well result in cellular activation and altered transcription. this has led to the marketing of negative selection kits yielding "untouched" cells. the evidence supporting the advantages of such negative selection is, however, very sparse  <cit> . moreover, no studies have directly addressed the issue of whether specific changes in gene expression actually occur following positive selection. one recent study that used negative selection suggested that it had little effect on gene transcription, though they did not compare their selection protocol to one based on positive selection  <cit> .

another issue that has not been fully addressed concerns the effect of delay in the cell preparation protocol on gene expression. two studies have shown that delaying the isolation of pbmc from whole blood for as little as three hours leads to significant systematic changes in gene expression  <cit> . however, it is unclear whether these changes are global in nature or restricted to individual cell types.

to address these issues we have developed and optimised a cell separation protocol utilising sequential rounds of positive selection that enables the isolation for microarray analysis of cd <dig> and cd <dig> t cells, cd <dig> b cells, cd <dig> monocytes and cd <dig> neutrophils from a single individual. we compared gene expression in cells isolated in parallel using either positive or negative selection, and demonstrated that with positive selection very few genes change in a systematic way and that the few that do can largely be attributed to contamination, and that negative selection is far inferior due to higher levels of contamination. finally, we examined the effect on transcription of storing cells prior to separation, and demonstrated that storage leads to profound changes in expression, but only in cells of the myeloid lineage. thus, leucocyte subsets should be prepared for microarray analysis by rapid positive selection.

RESULTS
purification and microarray analysis of leucocyte subsets
to enable the expression profiling of individual leucocyte subsets we have developed and optimised a cell separation protocol based on sequential rounds of positive selection using magnetic beads. using this approach sufficient quantities of cd4+ t cells, cd8+ t cells, cd19+ b cells, cd14+ monocytes and cd16+ neutrophils can be purified from a single individual to generate enough rna for microarray analyses . even those cell populations present at low abundance, such as cd19+ b cells which make up less than 5% of total pbmcs, can be purified to greater than 90% purity .

to validate the separation protocol, rna samples extracted from leucocyte subsets from six normal controls were labelled and hybridised to affymetrix u <dig> plus <dig> genechips . hierarchical clustering of the samples based on expression data from  <dig>  genes determined to be present in all replicates of at least one cell type clusters the samples according to cell lineage . as an additional validation step we examined the expression profiles of a panel of  <dig> known cell-specific markers, comprised predominantly of cd antigens . hierarchical clustering of the samples based on the expression data of these  <dig> genes again clustered the samples according to cell lineage, with the expression pattern of individual cd antigens being as predicted . for example, mrna for cd <dig>  the invariant chain, is expressed highly in all cd14+ monocyte and cd19+ b cell samples but not in any other cell type .

as a further confirmation of cell purity the expression level of the mrna encoding each cell surface antigen used for positive selection was measured across all five cell populations . with the exception of cd <dig>  expression of each of the mrnas was restricted to the appropriate cell type. in the case of cd <dig> mrna, expression was observed not only in cd4+ t cells but also in cd14+ monocytes. this is not unexpected, as monocytes express surface cd <dig>  but clearly suggests that for optimal purities cd4+ t cells should be isolated from a monocyte-depleted sample.

moreover, cellular expression profiles from any one individual remain stable over time. cd14+ monocyte gene expression profiles measured in three individuals three months apart show a strong correlation  which is of a similar magnitude to that seen between replicates of the same sample, and greater than that seen between samples from different individuals .

positive selection is associated with increased cell purity
to determine whether purifying cells using positive selection has a significant impact on cellular transcription levels, cd4+ and cd8+ t cells and cd14+ monocytes were purified by either positive or negative selection in parallel. facs analysis of the purified cell populations showed that in every case positive selection gave better purities than negative selection . in the case of the negatively selected samples, for all three cell types there was a strong correlation between final purity and the relative abundance of all three cell types in total pbmc . the implication of this is that the process of negative selection simply results in an enrichment for, rather than purification of, the cell type being selected.

the few expression changes associated with selection method can be attributed to contamination with other cell types
to address the question of whether positive selection alters cellular transcription, rna from cells isolated in parallel using either positive or negative selection were labelled and hybridised to our custom spotted oligonucleotide microarrays. as shown in figure 3a the majority of genes called present in all three cell types showed no evidence of statistically significant differential expression. across the three independent cd <dig> separations, only  <dig> out of  <dig>  genes  called present were deemed to be differentially expressed between the positively and negatively selected samples. similar data were obtained for the cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  separations. strikingly, the majority of the differentially expressed genes do not change systematically and are only seen in one out of three experiments . relatively few genes were differentially expressed in  <dig> of  <dig> independent experiments , cd14:  <dig>  and cd8:  <dig> ), and even fewer in  <dig> out of  <dig> experiments , cd14:  <dig>  and cd8:  <dig> ) .

of the  <dig> genes that show consistent differential expression in two out of the three cd <dig> separations,  <dig> were over-expressed in the positively selected sample and  <dig> were over-expressed in the negatively selected sample . comparing the expression pattern of the  <dig> genes over-expressed in the positively selected sample with arrays of leucocyte subsets generated from normal controls  reveals that they are predominantly expressed in monocytes . indeed, facs analysis of the positively selected cd4+ t cells shows a cell population with the forward and side scatter characteristics of monocytes . this suggested that the over-expression of these genes simply represents contamination of the positively selected cd4+ t cells with monocytes rather than transcriptional activation. this problem has subsequently been alleviated by removing the monocytes prior to cd4+ t cell selection which reduces monocyte contamination from  <dig>  ±  <dig> % to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % .

similarly for the genes over-expressed in the negatively selected cd4+ t cells, analysis of their leucocyte expression profile on control arrays suggests that this over-expression has again arisen as a consequence of contamination rather than transcriptional activation . this is further supported by facs analysis of the negatively selected cells .

the majority of the differentially expressed genes in cd <dig> and cd <dig> separations are over-expressed in the negatively, rather than positively, selected cell populations . strikingly, essentially no genes are increased by positive selection in  <dig> of  <dig> experiments . as with cd <dig> cells, facs analysis of the negatively selected cell populations together with the leucocyte expression profile of the over-expressed genes supports contamination rather than activation as being the most likely explanation even for this minimal over-expression . overall, the data for the three cell types examined indicates that positive selection does not lead to changes in cellular gene expression patterns, but rather that the limited number of differentially expressed genes seen between positively and negatively selected samples is due to contamination, and this is much more marked in the negatively selected cells.

delayed cell purification results in variable but significant transcription changes, particularly in myeloid lineages
a number of studies have demonstrated that storing blood samples prior to isolating whole pbmc has a profound effect on their gene expression profiles  <cit> . it is, however, unclear whether this is a global response in every cell type, or is restricted to specific cell types. to address this question we isolated cd4+ and cd8+ t cells, cd14+ monocytes and cd16+ neutrophils from the same blood sample either immediately post venesection or following storage on ice for four hours. the expression profiles of paired samples where then compared by microarray analysis using custom spotted oligonucleotide arrays.

storing blood prior to separation has no noticeable effect on the separation process. the final purities for all four cell subsets were not statistically different irrespective of whether the blood was stored prior to separation or not . however, storage has a clear effect on rna levels .

for all four cell types the spread of the log ratio data for freshly isolated versus stored samples was greater than that of the appropriate self versus self hybridisation data , indicating a significant degree of differential expression between the freshly isolated and stored samples. analysis of the microarray data shows that for cd4+ t cells  <dig>  out of  <dig>  , for cd8+ t cells  <dig> out of  <dig>  , for cd14+ monocytes  <dig>  out of  <dig>  , and for cd16+ neutrophils  <dig>  out of  <dig>   genes were statistically differentially expressed between freshly isolated and stored samples in at least one experiment . the striking difference in number of differentially expressed genes observed in cells of the myeloid lineage compared to cells of the lymphoid lineage was maintained when only genes showing consistent evidence of differential expression  were considered. in this case,  <dig>  and  <dig>  differentially expressed genes were seen in cd4+ and cd8+ t cells, respectively, compared to  <dig>  and  <dig>   in cd14+ monocytes and cd16+ neutrophils, respectively . based on these observations it is clear that delaying the cell separation process should be avoided if possible, as even a short delay leads to significant alterations in gene transcription. having said this, delaying separation is much less of an issue if t cells are being studied, especially if the number of samples is high since almost no genes  were systematically changed by delay in three out of three samples.

discussion
for expression profiling to have a practical impact in the management of immune-related diseases, as it is starting to have in oncology, it is essential that it can be applied to peripheral blood cells. early studies, particularly in sle, have used total pbmc, and as a consequence the majority of the disease-related signatures identified have simply reflected differences in the relative abundance of individual cell types between patients with disease and controls  <cit> . to avoid this, and to identify genuine cell specific signatures, is necessary to profile purified leucocyte subsets. however, protocols for doing so are not established.

from a practical perspective the most straightforward approach would be to use sequential rounds of positive selection to isolate individual cell subsets. a critical question that has not been addressed is what effect, if any, the process of positive selection has on cellular transcription profiles. a number of studies have demonstrated that positive selection using magnetic beads appears to have a minimal effect on the activation status of the isolated cells, however none have looked in a systematic manner at gene expression  <cit> .

to address this we have compared gene expression profiles in cd4+ and cd8+ t cells and cd14+ monocytes isolated by either positive or negative selection. for all three subsets there was no evidence that cross-linking cd <dig>  cd <dig> or cd <dig> during the selection process led to widespread changes in gene expression. while on any individual array there was a degree of noise, across all the arrays for each cell type there were very few systematic changes. in each case, the majority of genes that showed a consistent change had a higher level of expression in the negatively selected population. while it is possible that these changes are due to downregulation of the transcription of these genes in the positively selected population, analysis of their expression pattern across a panel of purified leucocyte subsets from a cohort of normal individuals strongly suggests that the elevated expression is due to contamination of the negatively selected population with other cell types. this conclusion is supported by facs analysis of the negatively selected cell populations which show the presence of contaminating cell types consistent with the expression data.

contamination of the positively selected cells was only an issue for one cell type, namely the cd4+ t cells, which consistently contained low levels of cd14+ monocytes. this is simply a consequence of the expression of cd <dig> by monocytes, and can be efficiently eliminated by carrying out the cd <dig> selection on cd14-depleted pbmc. in a recent study du and colleagues used negative selection to isolate individual cell subsets from peripheral blood, and identified  <dig> probe sets that were significantly differentially expressed between the cell subsets in their study  <cit> . an identical analysis of our own data  identified  <dig>  probe sets  that are differentially expressed between cd4+ and cd8+ t cells, cd19+ b cells, cd14+ monocytes and cd16+ neutrophils. the  <dig> probe sets identified by du et al represent  <dig> unique genes of which  <dig> would differentiate the cell types analysed in our study . of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> are also identified by our analysis, and a further  <dig> show the correct differential expression pattern although it fails to reach statistical significance using the conservative bonferroni correction for multiple testing. the high degree of similarity between the two studies, despite the different purification strategies, further support the suggestion that positive selection does not lead to significant alterations in gene expression. on the basis of these observations it is clear that positive selection is preferable to negative selection for generating cells for microarray analysis as it yields higher cell purities and negligible changes in gene expression.

another issue that could potentially confound microarray analysis is variation introduced during the blood handling process, and in particular as a consequence of delays prior to cell separation. two studies have shown that even short delays between blood being taken and the separation process starting leads to significant systematic variation in gene expression in unseparated pbmc  <cit> . in this study we have extended these observations to look at the effect of delaying cell separation on gene expression in individual purified cell types. it is clear from the data that even a short delay in processing the blood sample results in significant changes in gene expression in cells of the myeloid lineage. however, this is not a practical problem when looking at cells of the t cell lineage, especially where large sample numbers are available, as the number of genes showing a systematic change in expression is negligible.

CONCLUSIONS
on the basis of these findings the use of positive selection has no adverse influence on cellular transcription, at least for the antibody-receptor combinations examined. thus, for microarray analysis of purified cell subsets where high purity is essential it may be preferable to use positive rather than negative selection. in addition, delay in the selection process should be minimised and standardized, especially if myeloid cells are to be studied.
