BACKGROUND
nuclear reprogramming is used to describe that the transferred nucleus from partially or fully differentiated cell has the potential to direct the reconstructed embryo to develop like a normal embryo <cit> . although successful production of animal clones from somatic cells has been achieved in various species, many problems in offspring could not be hurdled due to incomplete nuclear reprogramming  <cit> . cross-species nuclear transfer involves transferring cell nuclei of one species into enucleated oocytes of another species, which has been shown to be a potent approach to retain the genetic viability of a certain species near extinction  <cit> . however, most embryos produced by cross-species nuclear transfer were compromised because they were unable to develop to later developmental stages. to study inefficient reprogramming of the donor nuclei in the recipient cytoplasm from another species, nuclear transfer  between two fish species was used as a model in the present study. a pioneering study on fish nt was carried out by tung et al  <cit>  and extensive studies on fish cross-species nt were mainly conducted in cyprinid  <cit> . recently, cross-genus cloned fish derived from transgenic common carp nuclei and goldfish enucleated eggs were generated and the somitogenesis and vertebral number of the cloned fish were consistent to the egg-providing species, goldfish , instead of the donor cell species, common carp   <cit> . gene expression analysis of cross-species cloned embryos will shed light on the regulatory mechanisms involved in cross-species nuclear transfer and embryonic development.

nuclear transfer between two laboratory fish species, rare minnow  and zebrafish , provides an ideal model for the study of cross-species nuclear transfer. rare minnow and zebrafish belong to different subfamily – the gobioninae and the danioninae  <cit> . zebrafish is a notable model for developmental and genetic studies for its short sex-maturity cycle, high reproductive capacity, and transparent eggs, etc  <cit> . rare minnow, a special local species in china, not only shares aforementioned advantages with zebrafish, but also has many unique traits for laboratory study such as typical eurytherm and high adaptation  <cit> , and sensitivity to toxicity and virus  <cit> . such advantages enable rare minnow to be an excellent type of experimental fish  <cit> .

in the present study, we performed cross-subfamily nuclear transfer between zebrafish and rare minnow and obtained nuclear transfer embryos derived from zebrafish nuclei and rare minnow enucleated eggs. using a suppression subtractive hybridization  approach, we found a novel gene – k <dig> over-expressed in cloned embryos, potentially participating in the improper reprogramming of transferred nuclei.

RESULTS
identification of k <dig> as an up-regulated gene
to better understand the molecular events in cloned embryos, we performed nuclear transfer between two laboratory fish, zebrafish and rare minnow. as reported in our previous study, most of the cloned embryos were arrested at between sphere and 50%-epiboly stages <cit> . by using a ssh approach, we have totally screened out  <dig> differentially expressed genes in the cloned embryos at sphere stage. among them, about 10% are related to redox function, such as selenoprotein w <dig>  5-lipoxygenase and glutaryl-coenzyme dehydrogenase etc; about 6% are responsible for cell growth and division, including geminin, daz-like gene and cofactor of brca <dig> etc. interestingly, a novel gene, k <dig>  was found to be up-regulated in the cloned embryos at sphere stage. real-time rt-pcr analysis showed that the mrna abundance of k <dig> gene in the cloned embryos was about 15-fold than that in normally fertilized zebrafish embryos , which was agreement with the dot blotting assay.

cloning and characterization of k <dig> gene
full-length cdna of k <dig> gene was obtained from a smart cdna library. it is  <dig> bp in length with an open reading frame  of  <dig> bp encoding a putative protein of  <dig> aa, a 5' untranslated region  of  <dig> bp, and a 3' utr of  <dig> bp. it contains an mrna instable motif  and a poly signal  followed by a poly tail .

homology search of public database found three novel zebrafish protein sequences  to be closer to k <dig> but no homologous known gene in other species . secondary structure prediction by dnastar software shows that k <dig> protein contains more α-helices and β-folds but less turns structure and hydrophilicity regions, indicating its lipophilic trait. predicated by signalp  <dig>  software, there is no signal peptide in k <dig> protein. interestingly, the transmembrane helices analysis by tmhmm <dig>  software shows that k <dig> protein contains a tmhelix of  <dig> amino acids  . moreover, phosphorylation sites analysis by netphos  <dig>  server shows that there is a phosphorylation site  in the n-terminal and four phosphorylation sites  in the c-terminal but no phosphorylation sites in the transmembrane region. the data above indicates that k <dig> protein may participate in signal transduction.

expression profile of k <dig> during development
to figure out the expression pattern of k <dig> gene, real-time rt pcr was performed. as shown in fig. 4a, k <dig> transcripts were found in all the checked developmental stages and it was expressed maternally in the oocytes, indicating that k <dig> gene presents a characteristic of constitutive expression. wish was performed to obtain the temporal-spatial expression pattern of k <dig> gene and the results showed that k <dig> expression was detected in all stages, which was agreement with real-time rt-pcr results. in the ovary samples, the signals were obviously detected in the oocytes of different stages, clearly demonstrating the maternal expression of k <dig> . the maternally transmitted mrna could be detected at 8-cell stage after fertilization . after mid-blastula transition of zygotic genome activation, k <dig> was ubiquitously expressed in the whole embryos at blastula , gastrula , and mid-somitogeneis stages . at  <dig> dpf  and  <dig> dpf of development, the signals were detected in the whole embryo with more intensive labeling at the anterior tissues , including an obvious labeling of the hatching gland  and the pectoral fin territory .

sub-cellular localization and ectopic over-expression of k <dig> gene
to study the sub-cellular localization of k <dig> gene, we constructed pk31-egfp plasmid with k <dig> coding sequence fused to egfp gene. the pk31-egfp and pegfp-n <dig>  were transfected in epc cells, respectively. at  <dig> h after transfection, hochest  <dig> was used to stain cell nuclei and sub-cellular localization of k <dig> was judged by the co-localization of gfp protein. the results showed that k31-egfp fusion protein located in cytoplasm, rather than in nucleus .

to study the biological effects after ectopic over-expression of k <dig> gene, we visualized the epc cells nuclei using hochest  <dig> at  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h after transfection. we found the cells were dead after  <dig> h, which was validated by trypan blue staining. following comparative analysis in white field and the overlapping of the stained nuclei with green fluorescence which indicates the overexpression of k31-gfp fusion protein, we conclude that ectopic over-expression of k <dig> in cytoplasm causes the lethality of cultured fish cells .

discussion
nuclear transfer in fish has been successfully manipulated for over  <dig> years  <cit> . cross-genus cloned fish derived from common carp nuclei and goldfish enucleated eggs was given birth as reported by sun et al  <cit> . in our recent study, we not only demonstrated the success of cloned embryos derived from zebrafish nuclei and rare minnow enucleated eggs, but also the success of cloned embryos derived from rare minnow nuclei and zebrafish enucleated eggs by scar approaches  <cit> . samples used in the present study were strictly chosen at sphere stage of embryogenesis as described by kimmel et al  <cit>  to ensure the accuracy. in single cloned embryo, scar pcr was performed with primers distinguished rare minnow from zebrafish, revealing the success of nuclear transfer  <cit> . consequently, the novel gene, k <dig>  is certainly resulted from the nucleo-cytoplasmic interaction between zebrafish and rare minnow, excluding any artificial interfere.

previous studies demonstrated that the majority of embryos produced by nuclear transfer were compromised because they were unable to develop past the early development stages  <cit> . a common hypothesis is that inefficient reprogramming of the donor nucleus results in inappropriate expression of genes required for embryonic development. gene expression analysis of individual embryos will undoubtedly yield new insights into the regulatory mechanisms involved in nuclear transfer inducing reprogramming and embryonic development. in the present study, a novel gene, k <dig> was found to be over-expressed in cross-subfamily cloned embryos by ssh approach. to our knowledge, this is the first report of gene expression analysis in cross-subfamily cloned embryos. interestingly, k <dig> transcripts were found in all embryonic development stages of zebrafish and k <dig> was also expressed maternally in ovum, but its ectopic over-expression caused the epc cells to die during the cell culture. result of sub-cellular localization indicates that k <dig> protein can not penetrate the nuclei, and it may be participate in signal transduction by its five putative phosphorylation sites. previous studies indicated that the reprogramming efficiency of cloned embryos was influenced by many factors, such as epigenetic changes like dna methylation and xci patterns <cit> , failure to suppress previously active gene transcription as well as failure to activate previously inactive genes  <cit> , failure of chromatin remodeling  <cit>  and mitochondria effects of proper reprogramming  <cit> , etc. yet, we can conclude that nucleo-cytoplasmic interaction in such cross-subfamily cloned embryos caused the over-expression of k <dig> gene. further reliable studies in a comprehensive way should provide solid evidences to unveil whether k <dig> gene can affect the nuclear reprogramming in cloned embryos.

CONCLUSIONS
cross-species nuclear transfer can be used to maintain limited populations of highly endangered species, especially when the oocytes of these species are difficult to obtain. however, most embryos produced by cross-species nuclear transfer were compromised because they were unable to develop to later developmental stages. therefore, gene expression analysis of cross-species cloned embryos is necessary. here we used two laboratory fish species, rare minnow and zebrafish as cross-subfamily nuclear transfer model and report k <dig> gene as an up-regulated gene in fish cross-subfamily cloned embryos. importantly, ectopic over-expression of k <dig> gene can cause lethality of epc cells in the cell culture, which gave hint that why most of the cloned embryos were developmentally arrested in between the stages of sphere and 50% epiboly.
