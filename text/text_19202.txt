BACKGROUND
viruses in the genus alphavirus belong to the group iv togaviridae family and include nearly  <dig> virus species  <cit> . alphaviruses are able to infect humans and various vertebrates via arthropods, such as mosquitoes. the 11– <dig> kb alphavirus genome is a single-stranded positive sense rna flanked by a 5’ terminal cap and 3’ poly-a tail, and composed of four non-structural proteins genes  and five structural proteins gene , e <dig>  e <dig>   <dig> k, and e <dig> proteins)  <cit> . getah virus  is a mosquito-borne enveloped rna virus belonging to the semliki forest virus  complex in the genus alphavirus <cit> . to date,  <dig> strains of getv have been isolated in china: m <dig>  hb <dig>  hb0215- <dig>  yn <dig>  yn <dig>  sh05- <dig>  sh05-15– <dig> and gs10- <dig>  <cit> . getv has been shown to cause illnesses in humans and livestock animals and antibodies to getv have been detected in many animal species worldwide  <cit> .

the identification of novel virus species is important for the identification and characterization of disease. however, present research methods are mostly applicable for known viruses but few methods exist to characterize unknown viruses. current molecular biological techniques for the identification of new virus species are troublesome since some viruses do not replicate in vitro but some may cause a cytopathic effect. furthermore, specific techniques that require sequence identification are not applicable. to overcome these limitations, we developed a new method for virus discovery: virus-discovery-cdna rapd , based on the cdna-random amplified polymorphic dna technique   <cit> . vidiscr includes two key steps. first, the virus genome nucleic acid must be isolated without cellular rna and dna contamination. second the rapd analysis using the virus genome cdna or dna. using this method, we tested known viruses  and identified a new getah virus yn <dig> strain. virus nsp <dig>  capsid protein genes, and 3’-utr sequences were cloned, sequenced, and compared. the phylogenetic analysis indicated that the virus yn <dig> isolate is more closely related to hebei hb <dig> strain than the yn <dig> strain, and genetically distant to the mm <dig> malaysia primitive strain.

RESULTS
virus isolation
acute encephalitis syndrome  was observed in suckling mouse with growth retardation, panting, abdominal breathing, and arthritis . negative-staining electron microscopy  of the supernatant from infected suckling mouse brain  revealed virus-like particles . these particles were spherical in shape, with an envelope, and approximately 50– <dig> nm in diameter, consistent in size and morphology with that of togaviruses or flaviviruses.


virus discovery using vidiscr
the vidiscr method was developed based on the cdna-rapd technique  <cit> . vidiscr begins with a treatment to selectively enrich for viral nucleic acid. to remove the interferences from the cell genomes dna and cellular rna, a centrifugation step is used to remove residual cells and mitochondria  and a dnase  treatment is also used to remove interfering chromosomal and mitochondrial dna  from degraded cells, where the viral nucleic acid is protected within the virus particle. the viral nucleic acids of sv <dig> and sv <dig> were detected by the vidiscr method  from cell culture, demonstrating its capacity to identify both dna and rna viruses .


*note: “n” denote the unique and prominent dna fragments were not present in the test sample ; the denominator was the number of the unique and prominent dna fragments by cloned and the numerator was the number of the virus dna fragments in the test sample.

the supernatant of the suckling mouse brain tissue infected with yn <dig> was analyzed by vidiscr. the supernatant of uninfected suckling mouse brain tissue was used as a negative control. unique amplified dna fragments were present in the test sample but not in the control where the  <dig> reactions gave prominent dna fragments in  <dig> vidiscr selective pcr reactions . the  <dig> vidiscr fragments were cloned and sequenced from the  <dig> selective pcr assays. thirteen of  <dig> fragments showed sequence similarity to members of the togaviridae family with 98% identity to getv using the basic local alignment search tool .

pcr amplification, sequence analysis, and phylogenetic comparisons
using vidiscr, the non-structural protein gene nsp <dig>  the structural protein gene capsid protein gene and 3’-utr sequences of the yn <dig> isolate were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. other getvs non-structural protein genes nsp <dig>  capsid protein genes and 3’-utr sequences obtained from databases were compared, including those from mm <dig> , mag , alpv_m <dig>   getv_m <dig> , mpr , s_korea , hb <dig> , yn <dig> , and sagv . the yn <dig> isolate non-structural protein gene nsp <dig>  the structural protein gene , and 3’-utr sequence identity were  <dig> – <dig> %,  <dig> – <dig> %, and  <dig> – <dig> %, respectively, by alignment with  <dig> strains of getah virus found worldwide. analysis of all sequences  included in this study showed the highest nucleotide sequence identity between yn <dig> and getv hb <dig> strains.

the yn <dig> isolate nsp <dig> nucleotide sequences identity ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, while amino acid sequence identity ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %  between yn <dig> isolates and other chinese isolates . the capsid protein gene nucleotide sequence identity ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, while amino acid sequence identity ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %  between yn <dig> isolates and other chinese isolates .


note: a the lower left part represents the homologous rate of nucleotide sequence of viral capsid gene the upper right part represents the homologous rate of amino acid sequence of viral capsid gene.

alphaviruses possess a highly conserved 3’ sequence element  that immediately precedes the poly tail  <cit> . both the poly tail and the 3’cse are required for virus replication and, more specifically, for efficient minus-strand rna synthesis  <cit> . the terminal  <dig> nt conserved sequence was identical in all getv isolates, including the m <dig> isolate that was previously reported to have lost this conserved sequence  <cit> .

alignment with the other nine strains of getah virus indicated that the 3’-utr sequence homology between yn <dig> isolate and other chinese isolates  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % . analysis of all 3’-utr sequences included in this study showed the highest nucleotide sequence identity between the yn <dig> isolate and mpr getv  and the nucleotide sequence identity was lowest between the yn <dig> isolate and the south korean isolate .


phylogenetic analysis
to better understand the genetic relationship of yn <dig> to other strains of getah virus in the world , the previously published genetic sequences of getv and other alphavirus capsid protein genes and 3’-utr sequences obtained from genbank were used to construct phylogenetic trees. the phylogenetic analyses clearly showed that yn <dig> is more closely related to the hebei hb <dig> strain than the yn <dig> strain, and more distantly related to the mm <dig> malaysia primitive strain .


discussion
alphaviruses are mosquito-borne rna viruses that cause devastating or debilitating diseases in both humans and livestock. sagv and getv are two members of the alphavirus genus of the family togaviridae. getv is widely distributed in southeast asia and northern australia along the pacific ocean  <cit> . getv has been isolated from various mosquito species of the genera culex, aedes, and armigeres <cit> . it is conceivable that getv may use mammals as primary hosts in its enzootic cycle, and through these biting vectors, the virus may be transmitted to various animal species, including pigs, chickens, humans, and other mammals, on rare occasion, the virus may jump the species barrier and infect a human or other animal  <cit> . although the virus has not been linked to illness in humans, many studies have suggested that the virus is a latent pathogen of humans causing a fever of unknown origin. getv could cause illnesses in humans and livestock animals and, indeed, antibodies to getv have been detected in many species of animals around the world  <cit> .

analysis of all sequences included in this study showed that the nsp <dig> non-structural protein gene and the capsid protein gene nucleotide sequence identity between yn <dig> isolates and other chinese isolates  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % and  <dig>  to  <dig> %, respectively. multiple alignments showed that the s_korea isolate does not possess the  <dig> nt sequence from 11341– <dig> in the virus genome and there was a low level of identity  between s_korea and other getv strain at the 3’-utr sequences. despite possessing 3’-utr sequences of different lengths, getv isolates contain various numbers of an identical sequence element that could have originated from a large ancestral 3’-utr  <cit> .

phylogenetic trees constructed using viruses sequence data are the best indication of the evolutionary relationships between viruses and genetic changes associated with antigenic drift. to provide further insight into the evolutionary relationship of yn <dig> and other alphaviruses, phylogenic analysis was performed based on the capsid protein gene and the 3’-utr sequence of yn <dig> and other  <dig> alphaviruses. these analyses showed that yn <dig> is a member of the getv and was most closely related to hb <dig> and s_korea and then with yn <dig> and getv_leiv_17741_mpr to form a distinguishable branch based on nsp <dig> and capsid protein genes. thus, the phylogenetic analysis clearly showed that yn <dig> is more closely related to hebei hb <dig> strain than yn <dig> strain and more genetically distant to the mm <dig> malaysia primitive strain.

present methods rely on prior genetic knowledge but are not effective for the identification of unknown viruses. thus, we developed the simple vidiscr method based on the cdna-rapd technique  <cit> . the rapd technique is a type of pcr but random segments of dna are amplified. unlike traditional pcr analysis, rapd does not require any specific knowledge of the dna sequence of the target organism by the use of 10-mer primers for the amplification of dna. however, the resolving power of the vidiscr method is prone to interference from dna or rna from the lysed host tissues and cells . since vidiscr relies on a large, intact dna template sequence, it has some limitations in the use of degraded dna samples. therefore, the intact dna template sequence of virus genomes required and chromosomal dna, mitochondrial dna, and cellular rna must be removed from the preparation to perform vidiscr. in the current study, approximately 50% of pcr assays amplified dna fragments in  <dig> vidiscr selective pcr reactions  and  <dig> of  <dig> fragments showed sequence similarity to virus genes. therefore, vidiscr is a suitable method for the identification of unknown viruses.

the current study indicated that the vidiscr is an efficient procedure for the identification of known and unknown viruses with the removal of contaminating cellular nucleic acids, optimized nucleic acid amplification, large-scale sequencing, and bioinformatics. the vidiscr technology is general, non-selective, and rapid, that does not require prior knowledge of the target sequence. this technique could be adapted to include a set of universal primers for virus genomic analysis in a wide variety of species. vidiscr can identify a range of known and unknown pathogens that can be applicable to clinical samples including tissues or culture supernatants. therefore, it is well suited for the rapid identification of an unknown or unexpected virus involved in a disease outbreak.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study described the isolation and identification of a new getah virus yn <dig> with the vidiscr method. phylogenetic analysis indicated that the virus yn <dig> isolate was more closely related to hebei hb <dig> strain than yn <dig> strain, and the virus was distantly related to the mm <dig> malaysia primitive strain. this study provided a vidiscr method based on the cdna-rapd technique that is well suited for rapid identification of known and unknown or unexpected viruses involved in a disease outbreak.
