BACKGROUND
anticancer drugs which are in clinical use show their effect by acting as non-selective anti-proliferative agents which kill also the proliferating normal cells in the tumor microenvironment  <cit> . the past few decades witnessed the development of targeted therapies including monoclonal antibodies, which aim at targeting certain antigens expressed on the surface of cancer cells with high specificity. in particular, adding trastuzumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the ectodomain of the receptor tyrosine kinase erbb <dig>  to regimens containing existing chemotherapeutic agents has significantly improved clinical outcomes for breast cancer patients. however, de novo and acquired resistance to targeted therapeutics are common and the next challenges for the contemporary cancer researchers  <cit> .

the erbb family of receptor tyrosine kinases is composed of four receptors that have the ability to form homo- and heterodimers, and couple binding of extracellular growth factors to intracellular signal transduction pathways  <cit> . erbb <dig>  the main player of the erbb network, does not show any ligand binding activity, but has high dimerization affinity  <cit> . the abnormal activation of erbb receptors through gene amplification, mutations, or protein overexpression has been linked to breast cancer prognosis  <cit> . trastuzumab is administrated to erbb2-overexpressing breast cancer patients  <cit> . the drug shows its effect by inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity , disrupting the downstream signaling of erbb <dig> and also resulting in g1/s cell cycle arrest  <cit> . however, the response rate to trastuzumab is rather low, with a range from 12% to 34% having been reported for a median duration of  <dig> months  <cit> . hence, at least two third of the patients are de novo resistant. on the cellular level, this might be caused by cancer cells being able to overcome cell cycle arrest despite targeting the erbb <dig> receptor. therefore, additional targets have to be identified, which should avoid bypass of cell cycle arrest mechanisms.

the cell cycle of eukaryotic organisms is tightly regulated by the cyclin-dependent kinases  and their activation partners, cyclins  <cit> , which lead cells through the well-ordered g1-, s-, g2-, and m-phases. it has been shown that erbb <dig> regulates g1/s transition during cell cycle progression by modulating the activity of the cyclin d, cyclin e/cdk complex, the c-myc oncogene, and the p <dig> kinase inhibitor  <cit> . the restriction points within different cell cycle phases represent key checkpoints, where the critical decisions are made for the cells to divide. at the g1/s restriction point of the cell cycle, cells are committed to enter s phase where dna replication takes place  <cit> . this process is regulated by cyclin d/cdk4/ <dig> and cyclin e/cdk <dig> complexes, which phosphorylate and thereby inactivate tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein prb  <cit> . hyperphosphorylation of prb results in the release of the e2f transcription factor that then initiates the transcription of essential genes for dna replication  <cit> . in both normal and tumor cells, prb oscillates between an active  state in early g <dig> and an inactive  state in the late g <dig>  s and g2/m phases  <cit> . therefore, phosphorylation and subsequent inactivation of prb represents a key event governing cell proliferation.

there have been few studies which applied systems biology approaches to identify novel markers  <cit>  and to define drug target networks in human cancer and other pathologies  <cit> . in this study, we focused on the regulation of prb through erbb-receptor signaling at a network level in a de novo trastuzumab resistant cell system to identify new potential perturbation points leading to cell cycle arrest. instead of single candidate gene approach, which generally examines the role of a single protein considering it either in conjunction with a second protein or regardless to other proteins, we applied a systems biology approach to identify the role of each component in the context of protein interaction networks. this strategy is motivated by the fact that cells react to perturbation of a single protein by taking advantage of using alternative ways to keep the system robust. in drug resistance, these alternative ways allow bypassing the inhibitory effect of drug treatment. therefore, in order to find the uncommon perturbations to which cells cannot find an efficient way to react, we first integrated published data to build the protein network for erbb-receptor regulated cell cycle progression, then combined qualitative dynamical modeling and robust experimental approaches, and finally predicted suitable and efficient targets for individual or combinatorial treatments in de novo trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer as a model system.

we used the boolean logical framework for the dynamical modeling and analysis of the biological network. this framework simplifies the regulatory activity of proteins by considering them as all or none devices. more precisely, each protein is defined as being either active  or inactive  depending on its abundance or activity level. we selected  <dig> proteins connecting erbb receptor signaling to the g1/s transition of cell cycle, and defined logical rules to describe their regulations with regard to literature information. modeling and loss of function simulations of the network proteins were performed using the modeling and simulation software ginsim  <cit> .

experimental perturbations of each network element using rnai and following measurements of their effects on the output protein allowed us to compare simulations with the experimental results. quantitative measurements of protein abundance and activation states using reverse phase protein arrays   <cit>  enabled us to reverse engineer the interactions of proteins in the cell system we used, and to compare the experimental network data with published results of single protein analysis. utilizing specific inhibitors against potential targets alone or in combination with trastuzumab, we further validated the rnai experiments and finally defined potential future therapeutic strategies.

RESULTS
characterization of the de novo trastuzumab resistant cell system
we first identified a suitable de novo trastuzumab resistant cell system as prerequisite for studying the erbb-receptor regulated network. this cell system should have high erbb <dig> expression but be resistant to trastuzumab treatment. to this end, we first analyzed several breast carcinoma cell lines and the normal epithelial mcf-12a cell line for their expression of erbb family receptors at mrna and protein levels, respectively . hcc <dig> cells, like sk-br- <dig> and bt <dig> cells, express high levels of egfr  and erbb <dig> receptors, but have low levels of erbb <dig>  erbb <dig> receptor expression was not detected in the hcc <dig> cell line.

next, we examined the response to trastuzumab treatment of breast carcinoma cells with high erbb <dig> expression  as compared to cells with low erbb <dig> level  in a viability assay . cells were treated with or without trastuzumab and cell viability was assayed over time to observe the effect of the drug. we further tested different concentrations of trastuzumab to rule out the possibility that the resistance of cell system could have been due to insufficient amounts of trastuzumab being present in the assay . while sk-br- <dig> cells responded to trastuzumab starting from day two, hcc <dig> cells were resistant, as they did not show any response to the drug over four days.

lastly, we verified the resistance of hcc <dig> cells to trastuzumab in 3-d cell culture . after eight days of treatment, hcc <dig> cells were still growing in a large cluster-like structure that was similar to untreated hcc <dig> cells, whereas sk-br- <dig> cells were sensitive to trastuzumab also in 3-d culture. we could exclude that the resistance phenotype of hcc <dig> cells was due to a higher or lower erbb <dig> expression level compared to sensitive sk-br- <dig> cells . furthermore, to rule out the potential impact of possible mutations in the erbb <dig> protein on resistance phenotype of the hcc <dig> cells, the erbb <dig> gene sequence was verified by sequencing and no mutation was found. hence, hcc <dig> cells were chosen as a de novo trastuzumab resistant model cell system in this study.

determination of experimental output
next, we characterized hcc <dig> cells with regard to g1/s progression by measuring the levels of prb phosphorylation, and of cell cycle proteins by comparing mock  and cdk <dig> sirna transfected cells. after synchronization, we stimulated the cells with egf. starting from " <dig> hour ", cells were lysed at different time points and proteins of interest were detected with specific antibodies . cdk <dig> knockdown was efficient, as no residual protein was visible on the blot. due to dif- <dig> treatment, which degrades cyclin d <dig> at both mrna and protein levels  <cit> , the level of cyclin d <dig> was low at  <dig> h while it increased upon continuous egf stimulation. after  <dig> h of egf stimulation, cyclin d <dig> expression remained constant until  <dig> hours in both mock-treated cells and after cdk <dig> knockdown. for the mock control, a gradual increase in the cyclin e <dig> level was observed, starting from egf stimulation  to  <dig> hours. in contrast, cyclin e <dig> expression did not change from  <dig> h to  <dig> h after cdk <dig> knockdown. surprisingly, we observed a reduction also of cdk <dig> in the cdk4-sirna treated cells, starting at  <dig> h. this might be due to the partnering of cdk <dig> with cyclin e <dig>  whose level did not increase in case of cdk <dig> knockdown.

we found the phosphorylation of prb , our marker for g1/s transition, to be delayed and the prb expression level to be decreased after cdk <dig> knockdown, as compared to the mock control. hence, we next quantified the phosphorylation level of prb  in the same lysates using reverse phase protein arrays . the phosphorylation level of prb was found to be low in the growth-arrested cells and induction of prb phosphorylation from  <dig> to  <dig> hours did not occur abruptly for cdk <dig> knockdown compared to mock. these data demonstrate that phosphorylation of prb at the transition point can be quantified by rppa as an output of egf stimulation.

literature-based boolean network of g1/s transition
the initial network of g1/s transition was built by extracting information from the literature about interactions between proteins involved in receptor tyrosine kinase-regulated cell cycle progression . the resulting network encompasses  <dig> proteins, including egf as stimulus, homo- and heterodimers of erbb family members, tyrosine kinase receptor igf-1r, key transcription factors , key signaling intermediates , and g1/s transition cyclins, cdks and cdk inhibitors . upon activation, members of the erbb family of tyrosine kinases form homo- and heterodimers. for hcc <dig> cells, six different such dimers are possible as erbb <dig> is not expressed in this cell line. the dimers erbb1/erbb <dig>  erbb1/erbb <dig> and erbb2/erbb <dig> were represented as specific nodes in the network. homodimers were implicitly represented by the corresponding protein nodes. since no ligand is known for erbb <dig> homodimers  <cit>  and as erbb <dig> homodimers have a defective tyrosine kinase domain  <cit> , the corresponding nodes are unable to activate the erbb targets akt <dig> and mek <dig>  the effects of the combinations of interactions on the activity of each protein was defined in terms of logical rules using the boolean operators and, or, and not. table  <dig> lists these boolean rules for the network components, and data supporting the rules is provided in the additional file  <dig>  table  <dig>  we then utilized the modeling and simulation software ginsim  <cit>  to implement these rules into a computational model. figure  <dig> shows the resulting logical regulatory graph for the erbb receptor-regulated g1/s transition protein network. normal arrows denote positive regulations, which are either through phosphorylation, transcriptional activation, or physical interaction . blunt-ended arrows denote negative regulations. the numbers associated with each edge refers to the respective publications providing experimental data in support of the corresponding regulatory interaction .

these rules were derived from the references listed in the additional file  <dig>  table  <dig>  the refined rules for cyclin d <dig> are shown with "*". symbols "Λ": and, "v": or and "!": not

simulation of loss-of-functions
for loss-of-function simulations, we performed in silico knockdowns of the network proteins by fixing the level of the perturbed element to "0", meaning that the corresponding protein was always "inactive" . each simulation was performed for specific initial protein states, matching the biological and experimental conditions . for example, the initial states of p <dig> and p <dig>  both of which being cdk inhibitors, were set to "1" because, in g0/g <dig> arrested cells, the expression levels of these inhibitors are high and their levels decrease  once cells progress through s phase  <cit> . to represent continuous egf simulation, the initial values of erbb nodes were set to "1". since the cells had been synchronized with dif- <dig>  which degrades cyclin d <dig>  the initial level of cyclin d <dig> was set to "0". using the resulting initial states, we computed all possible state transitions and iterated until we finally obtained a unique "stable state" in which the level of each protein was fixed . table  <dig> summarizes the outcomes of the simulations. out of  <dig> loss-of-function simulations, a significant decrease of prb phosphorylation  was predicted for cdk <dig>  cyclin d <dig>  and cdk <dig> loss of functions. for the erbb1_ <dig> and erbb1_ <dig> knockdowns, we obtained two possible stable states characterized by prb =  <dig> and  <dig> that should be resolved with experimental results. the loss-of-function simulations for all other network proteins resulted in the preservation of prb phosphorylation , thus tentatively enabling g1/s transition.

the first column  corresponds to the results of knockdown simulations for the initial logical model, while the last column  displays the results obtained with the revised model . in the "simulated", "p-prb data" and "improved rules" columns, the value "1" denotes the phosphorylation of prb  and "0" denotes the lack of phosphorylation . in the "7-aad data" column, the value "1" denotes a low ratio of g1/s  and "0" denotes a high g1/s ratio . bold numbers emphasize the knockdowns for which simulations and both experiments agree. normal numbers correspond to the knockdowns for which experiments led to different values, one of them being met by our simulation results. in the case of erbb1_ <dig> knockdown, one of the two existing stable states meets the concordant experimental result. the final state depends on the choice of the initial conditions, but these are difficult to fully specify . finally, italic numbers denote the knockdowns for which simulation data differ from the results of both experiments.

furthermore, we have also simulated the loss-of-function of multiple proteins  . we have observed that if one protein knockdown gives prb =  <dig>  the combination of any other protein knockdown with this one also gives prb =  <dig>  and we have verified this experimentally as well . we have also simulated the knockdown of all three receptors at the same time  and it resulted in  <dig> stables states with prb =  <dig> or  <dig> .

assessment of sirna knockdown efficiency and specificity for experimental testing of simulations
in order to validate the simulations having been performed for various possible loss of functions, we utilized rnai to experimentally induce knockdown of the corresponding proteins. first, we validated the sirnas according to their knockdown efficiency at both mrna and protein levels by qrt-pcr and western blotting, respectively . we obtained at least 70% knockdown at mrna level for all the network proteins  and for most a similar knockdown also at the protein level , both in single and combinatorial rnai settings  <cit> . because of the high level of sequence conservation among erbb family receptors  <cit> , it was imperative to test for a potential cross-reactivity of erbb receptor sirnas . to this end, we compared the effects of the pools of four sirnas for every gene with those of individual sirnas. neither pools nor individual sirnas were found to have cross-reactivity .

in the combinatorial rnai settings, the levels of the erbb proteins in the egfr/erbb <dig>  egfr/erbb <dig>  and erbb2/erbb <dig> heterodimers were efficiently downregulated . while the egfr level was drastically reduced when we applied double knockdown of egfr/erbb <dig>  egfr/erbb <dig>  and erbb2/erbb <dig> , the egfr protein was stable in the single knockdown with egfr sirna although this treatment resulted in more than 80% knockdown at the mrna level . however, knockdown of the erbb <dig> receptor resulted in a substantial decrease of egfr at the protein level. with respect to the qrt-pcr results, we can exclude that this effect could be due to a cross-reaction of the erbb <dig> sirna . therefore, we hypothesize an indispensable partnering of erbb <dig> and egfr in erbb <dig> overexpressing cells , and assume that the egfr receptor protein is efficiently stabilized that way. this hypothesis was supported by similar observations made in erbb <dig> overexpressing sk-br- <dig> cells, but not in mda-mb- <dig> having low erbb <dig> expression .

experimental validation of loss-of-function simulations
next, we designed a series of in vitro experiments using the validated conditions described above to assess the results from loss of function simulations. lysates of three biological replicates were analyzed with rppa using four technical replicates of each. the signal intensity of phosphorylated prb was measured in the near-infrared range  for each knockdown at two time points . as a negative control, we utilized mock samples which had not been stimulated with egf. results were compared to mock samples , which had been stimulated with egf, and the significance of the impact on prb phosphorylation was tested using the anova method. box plots of the knockdown effect on prb phosphorylation are shown in figure 5a. we classified effects as "1" in cases where the knockdown of a specific protein had resulted in a phosphorylation profile similar to the mock profile at  <dig> h, and no significant change of the prb phosphorylation state had been observed. conversely, if the knockdown resulted in a significantly lower prb phosphorylation level compared to mock , the effect was classified as "0", meaning that a significant change of the prb phosphorylation state was observed. the results demonstrated that knockdowns of cdk <dig>  cdk <dig>  cyclin d <dig>  cyclin e <dig>  er-α, c-myc, erbb <dig>  erbb1_ <dig>  and igf-1r indeed resulted in a significant hypophosphorylation of prb.

simulation of loss-of-function of all three receptors  had resulted in two stable states for prb: "1" and "0". experimentally, we have shown that knockdown of all three receptors resulted in prb =  <dig> suggesting that combinatorial targeting of erbb receptors may not be beneficial to overcome resistance in de novo trastuzumab resistant cells .

to confirm the effect of knockdowns on g1/s transition at the dna level, we measured incorporation of 7-aad into the dna of single cells by flow cytometry  <dig> hours after egf stimulation . the fractions of cells in g1- and in s phases were taken to calculate the g1/s ratio for each knockdown. we regarded gene knockdowns having similar effects as mock or p <dig> to be positive for g1/s transition , while g1/s ratios higher than mock or p <dig> were considered negative . for the knockdowns of cdk <dig>  cyclin d <dig>  cyclin e <dig>  er-α and c-myc, we thus observed no g1/s transition .

refinement of logical rules and network reconstruction based on quantitative protein data
to find out whether the observed discrepancies between our network model and the experimental data were due to the incorporation of incorrect logical rules, missing interactions, or even missing components in our literature-based network, we next refined the logical rules and performed a network reconstruction that was based on quantitative protein data.

extracting information about combinatorial regulatory effects of different proteins affecting a given component is much more difficult than extracting information about individual interactions from the literature. we have thus systematically evaluated modifications of the logical rule with respect to model prediction capacity. in particular, the discrepancy between the simulation results and experimental counterparts for c-myc and er-α knockdowns could be solved by changing the logical rules associated with the cyclin d <dig> node. we tested several combinations for the logical rules on er-α, c-myc and cyclin d <dig>  a minor modification of the model enabled us to recover the correct behaviour for the two loss-of-functions: er-α and c-myc , while conserving all the behaviour for all other proteins. the original rules assumed that the presence of one activator is sufficient . this is the loosest rule that can be defined for a node that is activated by several regulators. the modified rule  is more restrictive as this states that that er-α and c-myc together with akt <dig> or mek <dig>  are required to activate cyclin d <dig>  the biological implication of this change is that er-α, c-myc and  proteins should act together to make the cells pass through s-phase and proliferate. in addition, although both transcription factors are necessary at the same time, the function of the one of the signaling molecule, akt <dig> or mek <dig>  can be compensated in the cell, but not of the two at the same time. so, our results may propose a more comprehensive logic for the regulation of cyclin d <dig> in our model cell system. these results may hint that control of cyclin d <dig> is a sequential event  and can exclude the alternative edges from er-α, mek <dig> or akt <dig> to cyclin d <dig>  we are thus left with just one knockdown simulation  disagreeing with the experimental data.

in the next step, we wanted to test if the discrepancy observed in the case of cyclin e <dig> knockdown could be attributed to some missing interactions among the regulatory components considered in our logical model. in order to address this discrepancy and also to examine cell line specific regulations, we further quantified the activation and expression levels of most of the network elements for individual and combinatorial network protein knockdowns using reverse phase protein arrays. in total, we quantified the changes in expression of nine network proteins, as well as the phosphorylation levels of erk1/ <dig> and akt <dig>  some proteins could not be included in these measurements because of the lack of antibodies suitable for rppa. as for the prb experiments, we examined the effect of egf stimulation on the other network proteins for each knockdown, compared to mock. the heatmaps in figure  <dig> show the significant changes, at the expression or activation level of the proteins before egf stimulation  and  <dig> h after egf stimulation . expression and phosphorylation levels either confirmed known interactions or inferred novel ones . the resulting interactions define the network presented in figure  <dig>  a jackknife procedure  was used to eliminate putative indirect edges, which could be explained by a path along other edges, and only edges having a jackknife probability greater than 50% were kept . in the graph, solid black arrows indicate inferred direct or indirect interactions which are also supported by published data, whereas the dotted grey arrows denote novel regulations having been identified for the hcc <dig> reference cellular system. as a result, we inferred most of the interactions considered in our literature-based network from the experimental data for trastuzumab resistant hcc <dig> cells, although some of them have opposite directions. one should also take into account that drawing edge directions from biological literature is usually a daunting task. indeed, edge directions, when indicated, are often not well defined or even erroneous. additionally, there can be cell line specific differences or thus far unknown feedback mechanisms, for example a feedback from cyclin d <dig> to mek <dig> or from er-α to akt <dig>  it is, therefore, not really unlikely to see edges that link in the direction opposite to the expected. hence, although this approach demonstrates the feasibility of network reverse engineering at protein level using robust and quantitative protein array data, the resulting network was no help to solve the discrepancy observed for cyclin e <dig> knockdown, thereby leaving a gap in our knowledge in the regulation or regulatory effects of this component. to sum up, our network inference approach provided us with the knowledge that the most regulations which were obtained from the literature were also present in our trastuzumab cell system and novel regulations might have potential role in the observed phenotype of the cells.

combinatorial targeting of c-myc or egfr in combination with erbb <dig> using small chemical inhibitors in sensitive and resistant cells
in order to verify the rnai results and to validate the potential targets in our de novo resistant cell system, we applied small chemical inhibitors against c-myc  and egfr , alone and in combination with trastuzumab, and examined the growth of trastuzumab resistant hcc <dig> cells compared to sensitive sk-br- <dig> and bt <dig> cells. administration of the c-myc inhibitor alone resulted in reduced prb phosphorylation in all three cells lines , and its application alone or in combination with trastuzumab also reduced the growth of these cell lines . the results were verified using real-time impedance measurements over four days , providing a time-lapse profile of the growth rates. the resulting data demonstrate that the reduced growth rates of cells treated with the c-myc inhibitor was independent from trastuzumab resistance and thus support the rnai results shown in figure 5a and 5b.

because combinatorial targeting of erbb receptors is already in clinical use , we next targeted erbb <dig> and erbb <dig> receptors in single and combinatorial settings and compared the outcome in the de novo resistant hcc <dig> cell line with the trastuzumab sensitive cell lines. first, we examined the downstream effectors of erbb receptors  and of prb after treatment with trastuzumab or gefitinib  . in hcc <dig> cells, no reduction in the expression levels of egfr/erbb <dig> or phosphorylation levels of their downstream signal mediators was observed for both treatments. however, reduced prb phosphorylation was observed in gefitinib-treated hcc <dig> cells. both, the wst- <dig> viability assay and real-time impedance measurements demonstrated that trastuzumab resistant hcc <dig> cells were also resistant to gefitinib treatment alone or in combination with trastuzumab. .

in sk-br- <dig> cells, akt <dig> and prb phosphorylation levels were lower after trastuzumab treatment, and prb phosphorylation was reduced after incubation with gefitinib. in bt <dig> cells, a strong reduction in akt and erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation was measured after gefitinib treatment, while no such an effect was evident for trastuzumab treatment . real-time impedance measurement showed for the sk-br- <dig> cells that combinatorial targeting of egfr and erbb <dig> had a strong additive effect to reduce cell proliferation . this additive effect was also visible for bt <dig> cells although it was not as strong as in sk-br- <dig> cells. these data support our rnai results, suggesting that the combinatorial targeting of the egfr and erbb <dig> with gefitinib and trastuzumab, respectively, might not be effective to sensitize the cells to trastuzumab treatment in de novo trastuzumab resistance. however, these drugs in combination might lead to an improved outcome in sensitive cells, and potentially also in tumors, as compared to applying them individually.

discussion
in the present study, we have applied a systems biology approach to identify alternative targets in de novo trastuzumab resistant breast cancer. while several studies have dealt with mechanisms leading to acquired trastuzumab resistance, there has been no comprehensive study that searched for targets alternative to erbb <dig> in de novo trastuzumab resistance. since the aim of cancer therapy is to reduce the growth rate of cancer cells, and trastuzumab resistant breast cancer cells escape cell cycle arrest during treatment, we focused on a protein network that connects erbb signaling to g1/s phase transition, in order to determine new potential targets for perturbation. in contrast to previous studies, which had focused on the involvement of an individual protein in the resistant phenotype of the cells, we aimed to examine the roles of each protein in the context of their interactions at a protein network level.

several modeling studies about the erbb receptor-regulated signaling pathways have been published recently  <cit> . these studies considered the activation of key intermediates  upon egf and hrg stimulation and proposed differential dynamical models for these pathways. likewise, various models have been proposed for the control of the mammalian cell cycle  <cit> . in our study, we combined these two cellular processes into one coherent network to find novel strategies for breast cancer therapy. first, we derived a logical network from published data . systematic simulations of loss-of-function perturbations were performed, and the final state of prb phosphorylation  was determined in each case. these computational results were then compared with experimental knockdowns, obtained by rna interference. while each network component was targeted by sirnas in a single knockdown setting, both constituents of erbb heterodimers were repressed in a combinatorial rnai setting . we quantified the effects of these knockdowns on prb phosphorylation with reverse phase protein arrays  . knockdowns of c-myc, er-α and cyclin e <dig> resulted in a very strong reduction in prb phosphorylation compared to erbb <dig>  erbb1/erbb <dig>  and igf1r knockdowns . we then determined the ratio of g1/s to further verify the effect of these knockdowns on g1/s transition . dna staining enabled us to differentiate the strong effects of c-myc, er-α and cyclin e <dig> knockdown as compared to weaker effects of erbb <dig>  erbb1/erbb <dig>  and igf1r knockdowns .

consequently, cyclin d <dig> and cdk <dig> were identified as potential targets from both simulation and experiments. this result was expected, as in response to an external stimulus, cyclin d <dig> and cdk <dig> make a complex that phosphorylates prb, and which, in turn, enables g1/s transition. accordingly, we found knockdown of these proteins to result in a significant reduction in the phosphorylation of prb. in contrast, c-myc, er-α and cyclin e <dig> were identified by experimental analyses on de novo trastuzumab resistant cells, but had not been predicted in the initial network model. after network refinement, c-myc and er-α were also predicted as targets from the model . hence, we demonstrated that this approach enables the reconstruction of phenotype-specific interactions, which are essential to predict therapeutic strategies.

in addition, missing components in the protein network can also be inferred. for example, while cyclin e <dig> and cdk <dig> form a complex, which further phosphorylates the prb protein, our experimental data show that only loss of cyclin e <dig>  but not of cdk <dig>  significantly repressed phosphorylation of prb . this result suggests that cdk <dig> could be a dispensable component for the g1/s transition in de novo trastuzumab resistant breast cancer, as it has previously been shown for colon cancer cells  <cit> . this observation raises the question which alternative interaction partners of cyclin e <dig> could promote g1/s transition.

in our study, the transcription factors c-myc and er-α were identified as potential targets to overcome de novo trastuzumab resistance. park et al had previously shown that an amplification of the c-myc gene is correlated with erbb <dig> overexpression in breast cancer  <cit> . in trastuzumab sensitive cells, erbb2-targeted antibodies can inhibit c-myc through inhibition of the mapk and akt pathway which, in turn, increases the activity of p <dig> towards the cdk2-cyclin e complex  <cit> . here, we demonstrated that loss of c-myc activity results in a reduction of the cdk <dig> level which then results in reduced prb phosphorylation . targeting c-myc with a specific chemical inhibitor alone or in combination with trastuzumab also resulted in a strong reduction in prb phosphorylation and cell growth, both in trastuzumab resistant and sensitive cells . we conclude that targeting c-myc alone or in combination with trastuzumab could be an interesting candidate for a clinical trial. cross-talk between erbb <dig> signaling and er-α activation has been previously reported  <cit> , and an increase in the erbb <dig> expression level has been reported in tamoxifen resistant cells  <cit> . in this study, we have shown that er-α is another possible target in erbb <dig> overexpressing and trastuzumab resistant hcc <dig> cells. this suggests an interplay between er-α and erbb <dig> receptors in the context of bypassing the effects of drug treatment.

interestingly, the five novel candidates to be targeted in de novo trastuzumab resistant breast cancer have one feature in common: they all either directly  or indirectly  regulate the p <dig> protein, which plays a key role also in acquired trastuzumab resistance  <cit> . in addition, our study indicated that combinatorial targeting of either of erbb <dig>  erbb <dig> and errb <dig> may not enhance sensitivity to trastuzumab in de novo resistant patients, although erbb proteins have been previously considered as promising targets. these results let us hypothesize that these cell surface proteins  are decoupled from intracellular processes  in the de novo trastuzumab resistant cell system. targeting egfr alone or in combination with erbb <dig> further supported this notion. while trastuzumab sensitive cells  were responding to gefitinib as well as combination of gefitinib and trastuzumab treatment in an additive manner, de novo trastuzumab resistant cells  did not respond at all . this observation suggests that combinatorial targeting of cell surface receptors might be beneficial as it is an uncommon perturbation for cells  <cit> , but it should be taken into consideration that this might be cell system- or patient specific.

according to our results, targeting egfr with sirnas alone resulted in an efficient knockdown at the mrna level; however, no reduction was observed at the protein level . this phenomenon might be explained by the stabilization of egfr after dimerization with the overexpressed erbb <dig> receptor. complementary to this observation, knocking down erbb <dig> resulted in reduced egfr expression at the protein level, although no reduction of egfr was observed at the mrna level . these data demonstrate an explicit dependence of egfr protein abundance on erbb <dig> expression, and should be kept in mind when egfr is targeted in cancer therapies. this observation is independent of trastuzumab sensitivity, but is highly influenced by the erbb <dig> expression level .

it should be noted that the logical formalism used in this work clearly caricatures subtle dose effects into all-or-none responses for all the components considered. the resulting logical model should thus be taken as a first step in the formalisation of the regulatory network involved in trastuzumab resistance. however, it is appropriate to translate qualitative information and compare the behaviour of alternative network wirings or logical rules with data sets for unperturbed and perturbed situations. once the regulatory wiring and the logical rules be reasonably established, it will be possible to take advantage of multi-level logical modeling extensions, or yet to translate our boolean models into more quantitative formalisms .

CONCLUSIONS
we constructed a literature-based protein network and combined computational simulations, validation experiments using rnai, as well as chemical inhibitors, and network inference based on proteomic data, in order to identify novel targets with potential for individual and combinatorial therapies in breast cancer. our concept to combine experimental and computational biology demonstrated the strengths and limitations of using literature-based models for simulations of therapeutic strategies. furthermore, this study led us to select c-myc as a candidate to be tested in in vitro and in vivo models, regarding future treatments for breast cancer which is de novo resistant to trastuzumab. our results also suggest that combinatorial targeting of key erbb receptors might have better outcome than individual therapies in trastuzumab sensitive cells, but not in de novo trastuzumab resistant cells.
