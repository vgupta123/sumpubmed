BACKGROUND
herpesvirus gene expression occurs in a temporally regulated fashion involving three major gene sets  <cit> . the first set consists of the immediate-early genes, which are defined as those that are transcribed in the absence of de novo protein synthesis. these genes regulate the subsequent expression of other genes. the next set, the early genes, encodes the enzymes involved in nucleotide metabolism and replication of the viral genome, and several envelope glycoproteins. the final set, the late genes, requires viral dna synthesis for expression and encodes viral structural proteins. there is usually no clear boundary between early and late expression, and an intermediate leaky-late or early-late group has been proposed. although this widely-used classification of herpesvirus genes may not fully reflect the subtle regulation of viral gene expression in infected cells, it helps understanding of the viral replication cycle, gene functions, virus-host interactions and possibilities for control of disease.

herpesvirus genes have traditionally been classified kinetically on the basis of individual expression studies in cell culture  <cit> . application of specific chemicals to inhibit selectively the expression of early and/or late genes has contributed to the classification and functional characterization of genes. more recently, genome-wide microarray and reverse transcription quantitative pcr expression studies have been performed for several mammalian herpesviruses in the family herpesviridae <cit> . however, little is known about expression in members of the family alloherpesviridae, which infect amphibians and fish.

for channel catfish virus  the expression kinetics of a limited number of open reading frames , namely orf <dig>  orf <dig>  orf5/ <dig>  orf <dig>  orf8a/ <dig>  orf <dig>  orf12/ <dig>  orf <dig> and orf <dig>  <cit> , has been studied in cell culture by northern blot analyses. transcriptional regulation of all  <dig> orfs in the terminal direct repeat of the genome has been analysed by northern blot analysis in cell culture  <cit>  and by rt-pcr and southern blot analysis in vivo <cit> . for this small number of ichv <dig> orfs, temporal expression patterns similar to that of mammalian herpesviruses have been demonstrated. in addition, transcription in cell culture of  <dig> orfs in koi herpesvirus  has been demonstrated by rt-pcr  <cit> .

anguillid herpesvirus  <dig>  causes a haemorrhagic disease and is associated with increased mortality rates in the japanese eel  and european eel   <cit> . in this first report on genome-wide transcription of an alloherpesvirus, we characterized expression in cell culture of anghv <dig> orfs that are predicted to encode functional proteins by using rt-qpcr, which permits sensitive quantitation of specific rnas  <cit> . expression of early and late orfs was selectively blocked by a protein synthesis inhibitor, and expression of late orfs was inhibited by a viral dna polymerase inhibitor. the genes were classified on the basis of their expression patterns in the presence of these inhibitors. we identified four putative immediate-early orfs, and – on the basis of their transcription profiles – clustered all but three of the remaining  <dig> orfs into early, early-late and late gene categories. the analysis relied on an anghv <dig> map  that is a substantial improvement on the original map derived from bioinformatic analysis of the complete genome sequence  <cit> . the updated map was derived from a deep-sequencing transcriptome study  <cit> , and included redefined orfs and experimentally supported polyadenylation  sites. the deep sequencing study also showed that, overall,  <dig> % of late transcription of anghv <dig> orfs is directed by the sense dna strand.

RESULTS
one-day old eel kidney  <dig>  cell monolayers  <cit>  in 6-well plates were pre-incubated with either virus growth medium , vgm containing protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide , or vgm containing viral dna polymerase inhibitor phosphonoacetic acid . after the pre-incubation, the cells were infected with the dutch anghv- <dig> isolate cvi <dig>  <cit>  at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig> 50% tissue culture infective dose /cell in the appropriate vgm. rna was extracted at t =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h post infection . potential contaminating dna was removed, polya rna was extracted and reverse transcribed into cdna. sybr green quantitative pcr reactions were carried out for all anghv <dig> orfs, taking a reaction for the reference β-actin gene of european eel  <cit>  into account in every qpcr run for each time point. based on the efficiency of amplification  for each primerset, relative expression ratio   <cit> , change in relative gene expression , inhibitory effect of chx at t =  <dig> and t =  <dig> hpi , and inhibitory effect of paa at t =  <dig> hpi  were calculated.

reproducibility
experiments in which cells were untreated were carried out three times, and experiments in which cells were treated with paa or chx were carried out twice. the β-actin reference gene ct-values were highly reproducible; the mean value ± standard deviation of all measurements  of all experiments was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  .

relative expression ratios were calculated independently for each experiment, and the mean and standard deviation values were subsequently calculated for all orfs and time points. the average coefficient of variation for ri-chx for the non-inhibited orfs at t =  <dig> and t =  <dig> hpi was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the average coefficient of variation for ri-paa for all orfs at t =  <dig> hpi was  <dig> %.

families of 3’-coterminal transcripts
although herpesvirus genes generally have individual promotors, it is not uncommon for a single polya site to be shared by two or more genes arranged as a 3’-coterminal family  <cit> . in the deep-sequencing transcriptome study of anghv <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> such families were identified. with regard to the current study, the rt-qpcr signals detected for the  <dig> orfs that are not in 3’-coterminal families and the  <dig> orfs that are located at the 5’-ends of 3’-coterminal families can be considered accurate. however, signals detected for the remaining  <dig> orfs might be mixed with those from upstream orfs, and a more tentative interpretation is implicit in the results discussed below.

anghv <dig> gene expression
gene expression was detected at some time point for all predicted functional protein-coding orfs in the anghv <dig> genome. in general, levels were absent or very low at t =  <dig> and t =  <dig> hpi and increased exponentially during the monitored period. orf <dig>  orf6a, orf <dig> and orf <dig> were the first genes becoming detectable, they already showed significant expression at t =  <dig> hpi. maximum expression was measured at t =  <dig> hpi for all orfs, except for orf <dig>  orf <dig> and orf <dig>  which peaked at t =  <dig> hpi.

the net change in transcription at each time interval or rΔ was calculated for each gene . the genes were clustered based on their rΔ-values, and ten groups were distinguished . rΔ-graphs are shown for all gene groups , with the unique expression kinetics of orf <dig>  orf6a, orf <dig> and orf <dig> combined in one . the rΔ-graphs of the upstream located 3’-coterminal orfs are represented by dashed lines.

the rΔ of the  <dig> members of groups e1- <dig> is characterized by a very low value at r2-r <dig>  a steep increase between r2-r <dig> and r4-r <dig>  and a decrease or stabilization at r6-r <dig> . differentiation between the e groups is based on the rΔ-value at r6-r <dig>  which varies from practically zero  to more or less similar at r4-r <dig> and r6-r <dig> .

the rΔ of members of groups el <dig> and el <dig> is characterized by a very low value at r2-r <dig>  and a more or less linear increase between r2-r <dig> and r6-r <dig> . the  <dig> members of group el <dig> show a slightly earlier but less steep increase of rΔ than the  <dig> members of group el <dig>  both members of the orf <dig> gene family  belong to group el <dig>  with orf <dig> being identified as a low-abundant envelope protein  <cit> .

most of the genes fall into group l . the rΔ-value is zero or very low at r2-r <dig>  very low or low at r4-r <dig>  and almost maximal at r6-r <dig> . group l comprises both members of the orf <dig> gene family , both members of the orf <dig> gene family , three members of the orf <dig> gene family , three members of the orf <dig> gene family , both members of the deoxyguanosine kinase  gene family , and three members of the tumour necrosis factor receptor  gene family .

in the analysis described above, we followed the rt-qpcr-based approach used to study gene expression by tombácz et al. <cit>  in pseudorabies virus . in general, gene expression profiles are highly comparable for anghv <dig> and prv. the anghv <dig> and prv immediate-early genes and the prv large latency transcript demonstrate unique expression profiles, genes in group e show maximum increase of gene expression between t =  <dig> and t =  <dig> hpi, genes in group l show maximum increase of gene expression between t =  <dig> and t =  <dig> hpi, and genes in group el demonstrate an intermediate expression profile. anghv <dig> comprises about twice as much orfs as prv, which mainly add up to the el and l groups.

immediate-early transcripts of anghv1
inhibition of de novo protein synthesis by chx resulted in an inhibition of relative gene expression  of >66% at t =  <dig> and of >91% at t =  <dig> hpi for all but  <dig> orfs. orf6a and orf <dig> showed almost no inhibition at t =  <dig> and t =  <dig> hpi . orf <dig> demonstrated an increase in relative expression of  <dig>  at t =  <dig> and of  <dig>  at t =  <dig> hpi. orf <dig> exhibited an increase in relative expression of  <dig>  at t =  <dig> and of  <dig>  at t =  <dig> hpi.

in cells not treated with inhibitors, these  <dig> immediate-early orfs showed unique expression profiles that were clearly distinct from those of other orfs . no imputed amino acid sequence similarities with orfs in other alloherpesviruses were detected  <cit> . orf <dig> has been shown to encode a low-abundant structural tegument protein  <cit> .

early and early-late transcripts of anghv1
inhibition of viral dna polymerase by paa resulted in an inhibition of gene expression  at t =  <dig> hpi for all but two orfs . in the presence of paa, the relative expression of orf <dig> was doubled, and that of orf6a was not affected. table  <dig> shows the mean and standard deviations of ri-paa-values in the presence of paa at t =  <dig> hpi for the  <dig> orfs of anghv <dig> for which a putative function has been described , with the kinetic classes of orfs potentially compromised by 3’-coterminality marked with asterisks.

a orf numbering corresponds to van beurden et al. <cit> ; only orfs for which a putative function has been predicted are shown; orfs from which the data are potentially compromised by 3’-coterminality are marked with asterisks.

b mean ri-paa-values were calculated from two independent experiments.

c standard deviations of ri-paa-values were calculated from two independent experiments.

d immediate-early genes were classified on the basis of chx inhibition experiments; boundaries between early, early-late and late genes are explained in the text.

e gene functions were predicted based on similarity with known functional protein sequences  <cit> , and on anghv <dig> structural protein analyses by mass spectrometry  <cit> .

inhibition of gene expression by paa ranges from about 30% for orf <dig> to 99% for orf <dig>  a comparable range was described previously for prv  <cit> . the orfs are classified into kinetic classes on the basis of their ri-paa-values, with arbitrarily set threshold values. the typical early gene orf <dig>  encoding the atpase subunit of terminase, was chosen as the last early gene, and orf <dig>  encoding a structural tegument protein, as the first early-late gene. orf <dig>  encoding thymidylate synthetase, was denoted as the last of the early-late genes, and orf <dig>  encoding a structural tegument protein, as the first of the late genes. there was no clear boundary between early, early-late, and late genes based on their ri-paa-values.

a total of  <dig> early genes were identified . almost half of these showed a distinct expression profile in the untreated samples , characterized by the largest increase of rΔ between r2-r <dig> and r4-r <dig>  among the early genes are those involved in dna replication  and dna packaging , genes encoding a guanosine triphosphatase  , a serine-threonine protein kinase , a protein encoding a tnfr domain , and two low-abundant tegument proteins . early genes identified for ichv <dig> included the thymidine kinase gene , a protein kinase , and two putative membrane proteins   <cit> .

a total of  <dig> early-late genes were identified, with inhibition of expression values intermediate between those of early and late genes . in samples not treated with inhibitors,  <dig> of the early-late genes were grouped into one of the e groups, and  <dig> genes were classified in one of the el groups. functions have been predicted for  <dig> of the early-late genes . these consist of  <dig> genes encoding non-structural proteins and  <dig> encoding structural proteins. among the non-structural group are proteins involved in dna replication  and enzymes involved in nucleic acid metabolism. among the structural early-late gene proteins are  <dig> tegument and  <dig> envelope proteins, but no capsid proteins. for ichv <dig>  a membrane protein , a tegument protein  and a zinc-binding protein  were shown to specify both early and late transcripts  <cit> . our findings are in general accordance with the properties of proteins encoded by early and early-late genes of mammalian herpesviruses.

late transcripts of anghv1
a total of  <dig> late genes were identified ,  <dig> of which were clustered into one or other of the el groups, and  <dig> of which were grouped in the l group. functions have been assigned to  <dig> of the late gene proteins ,  <dig> of which involve roles as structural proteins. all  <dig> capsid proteins, as well as  <dig> tegument proteins and  <dig> envelope proteins, were identified as being encoded by late genes. similarly, the three late genes identified for ichv <dig> encode the major capsid protein  and two membrane proteins   <cit> . two of the putative host-immunomodulatory proteins of anghv <dig>  namely an interleukin  <dig> homolog encoded by orf <dig>  <cit>  and a protein containing a tnfr domain encoded by orf <dig>  <cit> , were also identified as being encoded by late genes.

location of expression in the anghv <dig> genome
a stringent summary of the kinetic classes of anghv <dig> orfs deduced from the ri-paa-analysis at t =  <dig> hpi is shown in figure  <dig>  with the  <dig> orfs potentially compromised by 3’-coterminality and the three orfs for which no data were obtained left blank. the immediate-early orfs are located within the terminal direct repeats  and near the right end of the unique region . the two or three immediate-early genes of ichv <dig> identified in a comparable way are also located in the terminal direct repeats  <cit> . the early, early-late and late genes are seemingly distributed randomly throughout the genome.

differences in expression kinetics of anghv <dig> genes with and without inhibitors
in the present study, we classified the anghv <dig> genes on the basis of their expression patterns in the presence of specific inhibitors selectively blocking the expression of early and/or late genes. this classification is not fully consistent with the clustering of genes on the basis of their expression profiles in the absence of an inhibitor. whereas all immediate-early genes also showed unique expression profiles in cells not treated with inhibitors , and most late genes were expressed later than the other genes , only half of the early and one-third of the early-late genes clustered in the e and el groups, respectively. the latter finding may partly be explained by the incomplete blockage of the expression of late genes by the viral dna polymerase inhibitor, but may also reflect the more complex regulation of viral gene expression during normal infection. the genes with marked differences in expression kinetics between both approaches are of interest for further functional characterization.

CONCLUSIONS
we have studied the kinetics of gene expression in anghv <dig> by genome-wide transcription analyses using rt-qpcr. four immediate-early genes were identified on the basis of their unique gene expression profiles in cells not treated with inhibitors, and on the basis of their unchanged or increased gene expression in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor. additional characterization of these genes is required to determine their potential roles in the regulation of gene expression. on the basis of inhibition of gene expression in the presence of a viral dna polymerase inhibitor,  <dig> early genes,  <dig> early-late genes and  <dig> late genes were identified. this classification broadly complied with cluster analysis of the genes based on their changes in relative gene expression in untreated samples. our findings on the broad functions of genes assigned to different kinetic classes are in accordance with those from a more limited exercise with ichv <dig>  and may be extrapolated to related alloherpesviruses. comparable to mammalian herpesviruses, most of the early and early-late genes encode proteins involved in viral dna replication, enzymes involved in nucleic acid metabolism, and several envelope glycoproteins. most of the late genes encode structural proteins. hence, we suggest that, despite the virtual absence of detectable genetic similarities between the herpesvirus families, fish herpesviruses of the family alloherpesviridae exhibit patterns of temporally regulated gene expression that are similar to those of mammalian herpesviruses in the family herpesviridae.
