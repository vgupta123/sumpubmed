BACKGROUND
regulated neurotransmission at chemical synapses underlies neural communication and is likely to contribute to complex brain functions, such as synaptic plasticity and memory storage. neurotransmitter release requires fusion of synaptic vesicles that is mediated by the neuronal snare complex at release sites of presynaptic terminals . this core heteromeric protein assembly, comprised of the t-snares syntaxin  <dig>  and snap- <dig> situated at the target or plasma membrane and the v-snare vamp-2/synaptobrevin on secreting vesicles, is responsible for membrane fusion that underlies the ca2+-triggered neuroexocytosis that is required for ap-dependent neurotransmission signaling point-to-point communication between neurons, as well as the regulated secretion from neuroendocrine cells. evidence suggests, however, that this neural snare complex may not be required for constitutive synaptic activity in the absence of presynaptic depolarization, although deletion of snare protein genes does alter characteristics of spontaneous neurotransmitter release events detected by recordings of ap-independent miniature postsynaptic currents or "minis" . for example, the analysis of neurons and neuroendocrine cells of snap- <dig> null mutant mice, generated by homologous recombination-mediated disruption of this t-snare gene  <cit> , has demonstrated the selective abrogation of evoked neurotransmission, leaving constitutive release of neurotransmitter in catecholaminergic  <cit> , gabaergic  <cit> , glutamatergic and cholinergic systems  <cit>  intact, despite varying effects on the amplitude and frequency of these transmitter-specific release events.

in addition to a well-documented role in membrane fusion for neuroexocytosis and neurotransmitter release, the t-snares snap- <dig> and syntaxin  <dig> also associate with voltage-gated calcium channels  where they are thought to modulate steady-state inactivation of channel opening thereby regulating calcium currents in response to membrane depolarization . in particular, snap- <dig> has been shown to specifically interact with one isoform of the p/q-type vgcc  to limit calcium currents mediated by this channel  <cit> . acute interference of snap- <dig> expression has been reported to lead to increased depolarization-induced calcium transients in cultured neurons  <cit> . increased intracellular calcium  would be expected to increase the frequency and amplitude of mpscs , yet previous evidence has shown that genetic deletion or bont cleavage of snap- <dig> can result in decreased mpsc frequency  <cit> . this raises the question of whether snap- <dig> plays any role in managing calcium influx through vgccs.

synaptogenesis and maturation of functional synaptic connectivity is accompanied by dramatically increased levels of snap- <dig>  <cit> , as well as a significant change in the relative expression of transcripts encoding two isoforms of the protein that are produced by alternative splicing between divergent, tandem arranged copies of a single exon  <cit> . interestingly, the representation of these two snap- <dig> isoforms differs markedly between neurons of the mature nervous system and in neurosecretory cells  <cit> , suggesting that these isoforms are likely to impart physiological distinctions to presynaptic function that are ultimately required for the distinct properties of neurons that make up diverse components of neural circuitry. consistent with this idea, the isoforms have been reported to promote differences in the recruitment of primed vesicles for neuroexocytosis in both chromaffin cells and hippocampal neurons  <cit> , and in hippocampal short-term plasticity  <cit> . nevertheless, whether such fine-tuning due to regulation of the expression of snap- <dig> and its isoforms plays such a role in sculpting properties of synaptic transmission in specific neuronal cell-types, and in particular excitatory glutamatergic or inhibitory gabaergic neurons, has not been fully resolved  <cit> .

to explore this idea further, we investigated the role of snap- <dig> in synaptic communication and on calcium dynamics in neuronal cultures prepared from either snap25-/- mutants or control mice. we then extended our analysis to examine differences in the expression of snap- <dig> isoforms between glutamatergic and gabaergic neurons during development and within different functional networks. our results support the idea that regulation of snap- <dig> contributes to the developmental fine-tuning of a universal snare complex required for mature, stimulus-evoked synaptic transmission both in cultured neurons and by major populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.

RESULTS
ca2+ signaling in control and snap- <dig> deficient neurons
previous studies have established that cultured snap- <dig> deficient hippocampal neurons fail to trigger depolarization-dependent presynaptic vesicular endocytosis or to evoke postsynaptic currents  <cit> . to complement these investigations, we performed live-cell imaging of intracellular ca2+dynamics in mixed cultures of hippocampal neurons and glial cells that were prepared from wild type snap25+/+, heterozygous snap25+/-, and homozygous snap25-/- fetuses. other studies have shown that when cultured rodent cns neurons adopt a synchronous pattern of synaptic network activity, it is reflected by oscillating ca2+ transients that can be monitored in the soma using the calcium indicator fura  <dig>  <cit> . ratiometric  measurements were taken over neuronal and glial cell bodies  that were identified retrospectively by both morphology and a sustained ca2+ response to depolarization after bath application of media containing high k+ .

neurons of both wild type and heterozygous cultures exhibited characteristic synchronous oscillating ca2+ transients that had an overall frequency of  <dig>  transients/min  . the amplitudes of oscillations produced by snap25+/+ and snap25+/- neurons were virtually identical , indicating that a reduced level of snap- <dig> in snap25+/- neurons did not affect the calcium currents measured from soma under these conditions. as expected, addition of tetrodotoxin  abolished neuronal ca2+ oscillations , demonstrating the dependence of these events on the propagation of action potentials and presumably synaptic release of neurotransmitters between cultured neurons. by comparison, as shown in fig. 1b, cultures obtained from snap25-/- fetuses showed virtually no spontaneous ca2+ oscillatory activity  in neurons. these snap- <dig> deficient neurons, however, did exhibit a robust ca2+ response after k+ depolarization , consistent with the presence of functional vgccs despite the lack of ca2+-triggered evoked neurotransmitter release in the absence of neural snare proteins  <cit> .

in snap25+/+ and snap25+/- cultures the resting i level in neurons after the ttx block was significantly lower than that measured at the trough between oscillations prior to ttx exposure . however, in contrast to control cultures, ttx did not significantly affect resting i in snap25-/- neurons .

to examine whether the mechanisms that underlie the generation of ca2+ transients were intact in the snap25-/- neurons, we compared their response with the ca2+ rise exhibited by control neurons after k+-induced depolarization. bath application of  <dig> mm k+ in the presence of ttx resulted in robust increases in i levels in null mutant neurons that were not significantly different from control wild type or heterozygote neurons . pre-incubation with selective voltage gated calcium channel blockers, moreover, did not show an overall effect on the relative contribution of l-, n- and p/q-type channels as distinguished by the progressive addition of nimodipine  and conotoxins giva and mviic . these results suggest that while snap- <dig> deficient neurons do not undergo ca2+ oscillatory behavior, presumably due to the absence of snare medicated evoked release, the general machinery required for ca2+ responses in the soma of these neurons has not been significantly altered.

astrocyte ca2+ dynamics
we observed spontaneous ca2+ transients in astrocytes in the mixed cultures prepared from snap25+/+, snap25+/- and snap25-/- mutant animals. as expected for astrocyte signals, ca2+ transients in these cells were not synchronized between individual astrocytes, and were not prevented by ttx. however, when high k+ was applied to snap25+/+ and snap25+/- cultures in the presence of ttx, most preparations showed a clear increase in the frequency and amplitude of astrocyte ca2+ oscillations , that occurred in parallel with sustained ca2+ elevations in neurons. astrocyte ca2+ signals were prominent in snap25-/- cultures and the characteristics of spontaneous events appeared similar to those observed in snap25+/+ and snap25+/- cultures, and were not prevented by ttx. however, in contrast to snap25+/+ and snap25+/- cultures, the average frequency of spontaneous astrocyte ca2+ oscillations significantly decreased  during high k+ exposures , although no significant change in the amplitude of the events was detected . this suggests that a lack of transmitter release from depolarized neurons impairs neuron-glia communication in these cultures.

developmental regulation of snap- <dig> in gabaergic neurons
while it has been demonstrated that snap- <dig> is expressed and required for stimulus-driven synaptic transmission by both glutamatergic and gabaergic neurons in fetal mouse brain and in culture  <cit> , it has been also proposed that differential expression of this t-snare may lead to differences in calcium dynamics between inhibitory and excitatory synapses  <cit>  and thereby possibly contribute to the physiological diversity observed between these neurons . however, in the preceding experiments we did not detect a significant effect of snap- <dig> expression on the modulation of calcium responses in cultured neurons. neuronal cultures do not exhibit the appropriate synaptic circuitry that is developed in the intact brain. we considered therefore whether the developmentally regulated isoforms of snap- <dig>  <cit>  might be responsible, in part, for the distinctive synaptic properties of glutamatergic and gabaergic neurons. for example, while there is a general shift in the relative levels of the two isoforms during brain maturation, the expression of the earlier expressed snap-25a persists in most neuroendocrine cells, as well as in certain discrete neuronal populations  <cit> . furthermore, the expression of the variant snap- <dig> isoforms has been shown to affect the size of the rrp in hippocampal neurons  <cit> , as well as in adrenal chromaffin cells  <cit> , and has been suggested to contribute to developmental changes in hippocampal short-term synaptic plasticity  <cit> .

to examine whether two snap- <dig> isoforms are differentially expressed in gabaergic neurons and therefore might play a role in tailoring the distinct properties of synaptic activity in these neurons, we utilized gad67-gfp  transgenic mice that bear a knockin insertion of green fluorescent protein  coding sequence at the glutamate decarboxylase  <dig>  gene locus  <cit> . expression of this fluorescent marker by virtually all gabaergic populations enabled us to distinguish and isolate gabaergic from gfp-negative, non-gabaergic and largely excitatory, neuronal populations. the level of expression of the isoforms was determined by real-time quantitative rt-pcr  using snap-25a and 25b transcript-specific primers  <cit> . preliminary experiments established that the primer sets were equally efficient in amplifying the specific isoform sequences from cdna templates, and rna transcripts prepared from brains of snap-25a overexpressing mutant and control mice, as well as from cells transfected with cdnas encoding the individual isoforms , thereby validating the rt-pcr assay as a measure of the relative expression of the two isoform transcripts.

a global description of isoform expression in the mature brain was first obtained by using fluorescence-activated cell sorting  to select egfp-positive cells from freshly dissociated cerebral cortices of adult mice . as expected, initial experiments demonstrated that a distinct gfp-positive  population of cells could be readily distinguished and isolated from gad67-gfp , but not control wild type littermates . subsequent qrt-pcr analyses were then carried out on the two fractions of sorted cells from transgenic animals to obtain gfp-negative  and gfppos  populations . the purity of the sorted cell populations was confirmed by qrt-pcr analysis for mrna transcripts encoding the transmitter-specific transporters, vglut <dig> and vgat. our results, summarized in table  <dig>  demonstrate that a relatively high level of vgat transcripts was detected in the absence of a vglut <dig> signal in gfppos samples, and conversely, a similarly high level of expression of vglut <dig> was determined for gfpneg cells in which vgat rna was undetectable. because the gfpneg cell population was not positively selected for any marker, it is likely composed of non-gabaergic neurons, the vast majority being glutamatergic, as well as astrocytes and other glial cell types. however, since snap- <dig>  but not snap- <dig>  is expressed in astrocytes  <cit>  and little, if any snap- <dig> can be detected in oligodendrocytes  <cit> , the amplification of snap- <dig> isoforms is primarily, if not exclusively, from glutamatergic neurons; a premise that is supported by the relatively high abundance of vglut <dig> transcripts detected by qrt-pcr.

* n. d.  is considered less than  <dig> %  of gene expression in comparable amounts of whole brain samples .

as shown in fig. 4c, qrt-pcr analysis of the gfp-expressing gabaergic cortical neurons obtained from adult mice showed nine-fold greater expression of snap-25b compared to snap-25a transcripts, indicating 90% of the total snap- <dig> mrna population was composed of snap-25b and 10% of snap-25a coding mrnas. virtually identical results were obtained from the gfpneg cell fraction, consistent with previous findings based on an rnase protection assay of total adult brain rna  <cit> .

since the relative expression of the snap- <dig> isoforms is dynamically regulated in cortex and other brain regions during development  <cit> , we next investigated the relative abundance of the specific transcripts in gfppos and gfpneg populations of cortical neurons prepared from p <dig> mice. as shown in fig. 4d, in contrast to the greater abundance of snap-25b transcripts in adult brain, the level of the transcripts encoding the two isoforms was equivalent in both gabaergic and non-gabaergic populations of neonatal cortical cells. these results indicate gabaergic neurons in the developing and mature neocortex, principally represented by interneurons, express the same relative levels of snap- <dig> isoforms as the majority of cortical excitatory neurons that predominantly express snap-25b in the adult brain.

relative expression of snap- <dig> isoforms does not vary in different anatomical regions
the previous experiment examined the regulation of snap- <dig> isoforms within a fraction of cortical cells based globally on neurotransmitter phenotype. however, this analysis did not address whether the differential expression of the isoforms is common between different populations of gabaergic neurons. therefore in order to evaluate the expression of the two isoforms within specific gabaergic and glutamatergic neuronal populations, we used laser capture microdissection  to isolate small groups of gabaergic and glutamatergic neurons from functionally distinct areas within the adult brain of gad67-gfp  transgenic mice. using a fixation procedure optimized for lcm/qrt-pcr analysis , egfp-expressing cells in several representative anatomical regions were readily identified and single-cell microdissection allowed capture of these selected neurons without apparent excision of neighboring cells . to obtain a broad sampling of gabaergic populations, we collected pools of approximately  <dig> cells including projection neurons from the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, caudate, cerebellar purkinje cells, as well as hippocampal interneurons located in both the stratum oriens and radiata of the ca <dig> region. in addition, we harvested non-gfp expressing glutamatergic neurons, specifically ca <dig> hippocampal pyramidal neurons and cerebellar granule cells, based on their distinct cellular morphology and location in well-defined areas of the brain. as before, we confirmed the purity of the selected gabaergic and glutamatergic neuron samples using qrt-pcr analysis of vglut1/vgat expression .

analysis of cellular transcripts by qrt-pcr revealed no significant difference in the relative levels of snap-25a and snap-25b transcripts between gabaergic projection neurons and interneurons, regardless of anatomical location, and nongabaergic  hippocampal pyramidal and cerebellar granule cells . overall, the predominance of snap-25b transcripts amongst these adult brain regions selected by lcm  was consistent with the isoform transcript levels obtained for adult cortical cells isolated by facs , extending these findings to neuronal populations in the hippocampus, cerebellum and the subcortical regions of the thalamus and basal ganglia.

to examine the level of snap- <dig> mrna expression in the selected cell populations, we further compared the qrt-pcr amplification of snap- <dig> isoform transcripts to β-actin rna, taken as reference housekeeping gene. amplification of β-actin rna transcripts, as determined by ct values was not significantly different among the different cell types . however, as shown in fig.  <dig>  panels c and d, the expression level of both snap-25a and snap-25b transcripts did vary significantly between various brain regions . in particular, although the relative levels of the isoform transcripts were similar, the major snap-25b rna transcript, accounting for ~90% of the total snap- <dig> rna, was significantly lower in gabaergic cerebellar purkinje cells than other brain regions . moreover, snap-25a transcripts in purkinje cells were also greatly decreased relative to gabaergic neurons of the reticular nucleus and the caudate, as well as hippocampal interneurons and pyramidal neurons . comparing the two major neuronal populations of the cerebellum, the abundance of snap-25b transcripts in purkinje cells was more than an  <dig> -fold lower, relative to β-actin, than in neighboring glutamatergic granule cells, despite virtually identical ct values obtained for β-actin rna . between the neuronal populations surveyed, gabaergic neurons of the reticular nucleus of the thalamus exhibited a high level snap- <dig> isoform rna expression with snap-25a being significantly increased compared with glutamatergic populations of cerebellar granule cells  and snap-25b transcripts at greater abundance than hippocampal pyramidal neurons , indicating that the absolute expression levels of snap- <dig> isoforms were also not tightly correlated with excitatory or inhibitory synaptic transmission. taken together, these observations suggest that in mature neurons of the major excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory gabaergic populations studied, the predominance of snap-25b-containing snare complexes neurons is a general, and possibly fundamental, characteristic, regardless of overall abundance of snap- <dig>  moreover, because the isoforms appear equally expressed by both glutamatergic and gabaergic neurons at p <dig> , these data suggest that during development and maturation of neurocircuitry the regulation that drives the predominant expression of snap-25b occurs similarly in major populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.

discussion
developmental regulation leads to the predominant expression of snap-25b in adult glutamatergic and gabaergic neurons
the expression of snap- <dig> in adult rodent brain varies considerably between different neuronal cell groups  <cit>  . the cellular requirement responsible for the differential abundance of this basic component of the presynaptic exocytotic machinery, however, is less clear, although it likely results from the varied demands in the synaptic physiology of different neurons and their circuitry. for example, early studies based on qualitative in situ hybridization, suggested that while snap- <dig> was expressed robustly by cerebellar granule cells, snap- <dig> transcripts were undetectable in neighboring purkinje cells . using a more sensitive, quantitative qrt-pcr assay, we show here that the expression of snap-25a and 25b rna transcripts compared to β-actin in purkinje cells is indeed considerably lower than granule cells, and ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> -fold less than the level detected in the other gabaergic neurons that were examined. purkinje cells characteristically exhibit a pattern of tonic low frequency firing, accompanied by periodic high amplitude bursts  <cit> . consequently, if snap- <dig> expression is driven by activity-dependent induction, the low abundance of snap- <dig> transcripts in purkinje cells may reflect their intrinsic, relatively low synaptic activity. nevertheless, our data only reflects mrna levels in the soma, and not the abundance or activity of snap- <dig> within the presynaptic terminal, which may be also regulated by post-translational modifications, such as palmitoylation  <cit>  or phosphorylation  <cit> . for example, in the hippocampus the abundance of snap- <dig> protein in presynaptic mossy fiber terminals of dentate gyrus granule neurons, which are highly active and contain a disproportionately large pool of releasable vesicles, appears much higher than in the terminal fields of neighboring pyramidal neurons  <cit> , despite apparent lower levels of mrna transcripts compared to ca <dig> pyramidal neurons. this suggests that trafficking, as well as functional modifications of this t-snare might play yet an additional critical role in the specialization of mechanisms that govern presynaptic neurotransmitter release.

while our results demonstrating the predominant expression of snap-25b isoform transcripts among neuronal populations of the adult mouse brain agree with a general shift in alternative splicing accompanying neuronal maturation  <cit> , we were surprised to find no evidence for the differential expression of the two isoforms that has been observed previously between other regions of the cns  <cit> . among the brain regions we sampled, the prevalence of snap-25a transcripts was remarkably consistent  for neurons selected for either gabaergic or glutamatergic transmitter phenotype. in fact, cerebellar granule cells showed the most difference between these neuronal populations with snap-25a transcripts accumulating to only  <dig> % of the total snap- <dig> rna. one explanation for the discrepancy between our present results and the previous findings is that we selected neuronal populations primarily involved in fast, point-to-point neurotransmission, thus largely excluding neurons that primarily secrete other neurotransmitters and may depend more heavily on snap-25a expression  <cit> . for example, among the areas of the brain shown to exhibit preferential expression of snap-25a into maturity, the pituitary and hypothalamus are chiefly populated by neurosecretory neurons that are characterized by their release of hormones and other neuropeptides  <cit> . neurons in these areas maybe more comparable to other neuroendocrine cells, such as adrenal gland and pancreatic beta cells, that persistently express high levels of snap-25a in the adult  <cit> , suggesting that the preference for one isoform may reflect a mechanism that tailors exocytotic machinery to secretory properties. consistent with this idea, expression of snap-25b leads to the greater recruitment of vesicles to the readily releasable pool in hippocampal neurons compared to snap-25a  <cit> , and similarly stabilizes a larger pool of vesicles for catecholamine secretion in adrenal chromaffin cells  <cit> . interestingly, the expression of the isoforms also appears to be responsive to synaptic activity. depolarization of dentate gyrus granule cells has been shown to induce expression of snap-25b rather than snap-25a  <cit> , whereas activation of neurosecretory magnocellular hypothalamic neurons has been reported to increase snap-25a expression exclusively  <cit> . selection of a particular snap- <dig> isoform, therefore, may provide a functional advantage in refining the exocytotic machinery necessary for different modes of vesicular release.

consistent with previous studies  <cit> , we find a similar developmental profile of snap- <dig> isoforms in gabaergic  and nongabaergic  neurons in the cortex with equal representation of snap-25a and -25b transcripts in neonates leading to the predominant expression of snap-25b in the adult. interestingly, snap-25b is also the predominant isoform expressed in dentate gyrus granule cells  <cit>  that have been shown to simultaneously release both gaba and glutamate  <cit> . several recent studies have reported, however, that although snap- <dig> was detected initially in interneurons of the developing hippocampus, the expression waned as these gabaergic neurons mature in culture and appeared to be undetectable at these synapses, as well as synapses of other gabaergic neurons in the adult brain  <cit>  . although the reason for discrepancy between these observations and our previous results demonstrating co-localization of snap- <dig> immunoreactivity with gabaergic markers in several gabaergic neuronal populations  <cit>  remains to be resolved, our present findings indicate that snap-25b rna transcripts are, in fact, robustly expressed by gabaergic neurons isolated from cortex, thalamus, caudate, as well as by hippocampal interneurons at a level comparable to that seen in excitatory, glutaminergic neurons. taken together with other studies  <cit> , these results provide additional evidence that snap-25b is a key component of the neural snare complex responsible for both gabaergic and glutamatergic transmission in mature neurons.

alterations of calcium dynamics in snap- <dig> deficient neuronal cultures
consistent with the idea that evoked synaptic activity is required to establish network activity between cultured neurons, we found that spontaneous, synchronized calcium oscillations were absent in dispersed hippocampal cultures prepared from snap25-/- mice. these snap- <dig> deficient mutant neurons were, nevertheless, able to generate calcium transients after depolarization. interestingly, the amplitude of spontaneous synchronous calcium spikes in cultures from heterozygous null mutants, expressing reduced levels of snap- <dig>  did not differ substantially from wild type neurons. moreover, the magnitude of the calcium response evoked in snap- <dig> null mutant neurons by exposure to high k+ depolarizing media was also equivalent to the responses measured in control snap25+/- and snap25+/+ neurons. previous studies have shown that snap- <dig> is associated with n and p/q type voltage gated calcium channels , and specifically impedes calcium currents through p/q type channels activated in response to action potential-like stimuli  <cit> . in our experiments, however, we did not observe a significant enhancement of the relative contribution of mcvii toxin sensitive p/q type channels to the overall calcium response in snap25-/- compared to control neurons. this suggests that the modulation of these calcium channels by snare protein interactions does not occur in the soma, but may be limited to presynaptic terminals, which lie beyond the level of resolution achieved in these experiments. in contrast to these results, matteoli and colleagues have reported a snap <dig> genotype-dependent difference in calcium responsivity with higher peak calcium responses evoked from hippocampal neurons prepared from homozygous snap <dig> null mutants compared to wild type, and intermediate values from neurons heterozygous for the null mutation  <cit> . one possibility that could contribute to these different findings may be the variability seen in the viability of snap- <dig> deficient neurons in culture . in an effort to control for this variability, we averaged the mean calcium peak response exhibited by 6– <dig> individual cultures  for each genotype. moreover, to control for differences in the complexity of neurite extension that is evident between cultures, and more importantly genotypes, we restricted our measurements to fura-2a responses imaged over cell bodies, thus avoiding the contribution of calcium transients in dendrites.

astrocytes have been proposed to join with presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic spines to form a "tripartite synapse," that enables bidirectional communication between glia and neurons . indeed, in most cultures of snap- <dig> expressing neurons, neuronal depolarization was accompanied by clear increases in astrocyte ca2+ oscillatory activity. this correlation could be due to a number of factors, including direct effects of k+ triggering depolarization on astrocytes. nevertheless, since astrocytes do not express snap- <dig>  but utilize the independent t-snare homologue snap- <dig>  <cit> , this deficit in astrocyte ca2+ responsiveness in snap- <dig> deficient cultures provides further evidence for the role of ap-dependent synaptic transmission in neuronal-glia communication.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, our results are consistent with the idea that snap-25b serves as the predominant t-snare responsible for action potential-dependent neurotransmission in the major excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory gabaergic neurons in the mature brain. in addition, we conclude that while deficits in snap- <dig> do not selectively dysregulate specific voltage-gated calcium channels at the soma, this neural snare component is needed to maintain normal synaptic activity that is reflected by calcium signaling between neurons and within a neural-glial network.
