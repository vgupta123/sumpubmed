BACKGROUND
osteoarthritis  is an irreversible degenerative disease characterized by articular cartilage loss and synovial inflammation. current oa therapeutic strategies are focused on reducing pain, physical disability and handicap, and try to limit structural deterioration in affected joints  <cit> .

cell therapy using stem cells has become a large field of research focusing on the development of effective treatments for this disease  <cit> . mesenchymal stem cells  are studied as a possible tool for cell therapy not only by their “stem” properties and differentiation potential but also by their trophic and immunomodulatory properties  <cit> . horses commonly suffer from oa and osteochondrosis, being diseases of great concern for equine clinicians  <cit> . in addition, horses are considered the most appropriate animal model for testing the clinical effects of msc-based therapies for humans joint injuries  <cit> .

while both autologous and allogeneic mscs therapies have been used for the treatment of several diseases  <cit> , the use of allogeneic mscs has gained relevance due to their shorter ex vivo expansion time  <cit>  and the possibility to be selected according to their characteristics to optimize the treatment .

the administration of a single dose and repeat doses of allogeneic-derived mscs obtained from one donor has been tested in equine under different conditions . although it has been demonstrated that repeat injections of mscs can enhance the benefit of these cells in different pathology models and administration routes  <cit> , it remains unclear if allogeneic mscs can provoke an immunoresponse  <cit> . using single-donor allogeneic mscs has some constraints, such as the donor selection or the number of cells obtained under culture conditions. therefore, the use of mscs pooled from several donors could be advantageous.

to our knowledge, safety of repeat intra-articular administrations of allogeneic bone-marrow derived mscs  pooled from several donors has not been yet studied in horses. neither their safety profile can be extrapolated from allogeneic-single administration of one-donor mscs  <cit> . hence, in this work we evaluate the clinical and inflammatory response to the administration of autologous and repeat doses of allogeneic bm-mscs pooled from several donors in tarso-crural and radio-carpal equine healthy joints.

clinical assessment
no visual evidence of synovitis was observed in the control joints in any of three injections. some articular distension was detected on treated joints in all experiments. the visual exam showed a marked distension only in two joints injected with autologous mscs . mild synovial effusion after the first allogeneic pool of mscs administration  was observed, whereas the allogeneic reinjection  provoked only a slight distention. in addition, a slight increase in local temperature was observed , ranging from  <dig>  to 3 °c after injection  <dig> in the treated joints compared with contralateral joints injected with lactated ringer’s solution  as control. in injections  <dig> and  <dig>  the average temperature increase in treated joints respect their controls was less than 1 °c. in all cases, the normal values were restored between  <dig> and 10 days and differences were not statistically significant at any time for any injection.fig.  <dig> mean ± standard deviation of difference in local temperature and synovial fluid parameters in injections  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  mean ± standard deviation  of difference in local temperature and synovial fluid parameters analyzed for autologous , allogeneic  and repeat allogeneic  mesenchymal stem cell  injected joints compared to controls. a difference in local temperature  between msc injected joints  and control  joints  at each time point for injection  <dig> , injection  <dig>  and injection  <dig> . b total protein concentration  at each time point for injection  <dig> , injection  <dig>  and injection  <dig> . c white blood cell count  at each time point for injection  <dig> , injection  <dig>  and injection  <dig> . d neutrophil count  at each time point for injection  <dig> , injection  <dig>  and injection  <dig> . asterisk symbol  indicates statistically significant difference  between mean ± sd in control and msc treated joints at each time point. controls are represented as dotted lines and treated as solid lines

assessment of synovial fluids
tp, wbc and nc values at each time-point are represented in fig.  <dig> and additional file  <dig> .

total protein 
a non-significant transient increase of tp values  was observed in control joints injected with lrs. significant differences in tp values between treated and control joints were detected post-injection on days  <dig> and  <dig> , days  <dig> and  <dig>  and days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the largest tp increase was detected 24 h post-injection  <dig>  in all cases the tp progressively decreased reaching normal-healthy values  on the 10th day post-inoculation.

white blood cells count 
a moderate rise in wbc was observed in all control joints . wbc counts increased in all treated joints. the increase was statistically significant after inoculation on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> after injections  <dig> and  <dig>  no significant differences in wbc values were found after injection  <dig> at any time point. wbc values diminished to normal reference ones in all cases by the 10th day.

neutrophil count 
control joints showed a slight increase in nc after the three injections . the nc increase in treated joints was evident on day  <dig> after the three injections, being statistically significant for injections  <dig> and  <dig>  this nc increment suddenly decreased at 48 h post-injection and remained low until reaching normal reference range on day  <dig> 

discussion
in our work, we have evaluated the clinical and inflammatory responses of healthy equine joints after intra-articular injections of autologous and allogeneic single and repeat pool of bm-mscs. bm-mscs were used due to their regenerative performance and its ability to integrate into the soft tissue joint  <cit>  as well as their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties  <cit> . equine species was selected due to its availability as human joint disease model  <cit>  and its own relevance in veterinary medicine  <cit> . healthy joints were chosen to approach articular immunoresponse to repeat allogeneic injections of bm-mscs. behavior and properties of mscs, such their migratory pattern  <cit>  or the safety of therapeutic strategies based on mscs  <cit> , are usually prior studied in healthy animals. the conditions in healthy and inflamed joints are different , so the response of healthy joints to repeat allogeneic mscs cannot be directly extrapolated. despite these differences, performing a preliminary study in healthy joints seems mandatory since if a negative response in normal joints would have been observed, this would discourage the use of repeat allogeneic doses of mscs in altered joints.

there are a few of very recent studies comparing the immune response to autologous and allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells intra-articular injections in horses, both in normal joints  <cit>  and inflamed joints  <cit> . however, none of these studies assess the use of a pool of allogeneic donors and the re-inoculation of joints with a second dose of cells. the use of repeat doses of mscs could be very important in order to potentiate the msc therapeutic effect, as it has been demonstrated in other species and diseases  <cit> . using a pool of allogeneic msc donors is also interesting in order to avoid individual variations and limited number of mscs in some cases.

the bm-mscs showed a normal growth pattern, with a proliferation rate and viability similar to other studies  <cit> . after cryopreservation, the cells showed a normal growth pattern indicating no effect on growth.

according to previous reports  <cit> , equine bm-mscs displayed similar gene expression of the surface markers. mscs used in our study were in passage  <dig> to avoid the risk of morphological or functional changes that might occur at long-term culture  <cit> .

intra-articular injections were performed using autologous and allogeneic pools of bm-mscs. allogeneic msc therapy is an interesting strategy using “off-the-shelf” product. allogeneic therapy avoid autologous limitations such as the scarcity of mscs, especially in cases where msc are low and the quality might be compromised as it happens in aged individuals and disease, and also in situations where autologous mscs might have the same genetic defects as the patient  <cit> . in addition, allogeneic use of mscs offers the possibility of selecting the most suitable donors according to their proliferation rate, their differentiation ability or their immunoregulatory properties.

the allogeneic bm-msc pool offers the advantage of availability of elevated number of mscs for the treatment of acute orthopedic lesions without the inherent period  associated with isolation and expansion of autologous mscs  <cit> . furthermore, the proliferation rate and chondrogenic differentiation capacity of mscs might be different because of individual-related factors  <cit>  and also their immunomodulatory properties, so the use of several donors could attenuate this variability. the results of this study show that intra-articular inoculation of equine bm-msc, independently of their origin , or the number of doses, produces a transitory inflammatory reaction that becomes restored to normal values 10 days later, without any anti-inflammatory or analgesic drug administration. this temporary inflammation was detected in both clinical and synovial  parameters. our results are similar to other clinical evidence recently described after injection of autologous and allogeneic mscs in equine healthy joints  <cit> . similarly, reports using an equine synovitis model have showed that allogeneic mscs induce an initial mild self-limiting inflammatory reaction when administered within the inflamed joint, but mscs reduced the synovial fluid cell populations in this model  <cit> . slight lameness was noted only in one animal 24 h post autologous msc administration . this animal also showed more marked signs of synovitis at this time. allogeneic mscs injection did not lead to any grade of lameness in any horse at any time. mild to severe lameness 24 h post injection of allogeneic cb-mscs in inflamed joints has been reported, but lameness did not correlate with synovitis induced by mscs injection  <cit> .

we assessed the articular inflammatory response after a second inoculation of the allogeneic equine msc . no hypersensitivity response was observed. the re-injection caused a transient inflammatory reaction similar to that detected after injections  <dig> and  <dig>  synovial parameters  changes were more evident than clinical signs, but spontaneously returned to baseline by 10 days in all cases.

although the cause of inflammation produced by the injection of bm-mscs is still unknown  <cit> , there are different factors that might be taken into account. the production, expansion and infiltration procedures were carried out in aseptic conditions, leaving out a possible septic origin that was supported by no detection of clinical or cytological evidence of a possible septic arthritis. besides the inflammation was self-limiting and resolved without any medication, which is incompatible with the development of iatrogenic joint sepsis  <cit> . there is controversy about the cause of this joint inflammation. some authors point out that any articular injection may cause at least a slight synovitis, or even a kind of reactive synovitis could occur after joint injection of any type of product . other authors suggest that the inflammatory response that follows administration of mscs may be due to the exquisite sensitivity of healthy equine joints to the introduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines that may be present in cell culture, or even to chemical or biologically active substances present in the culture medium used, such as fetal bovine serum  <cit> . recently, it has been demonstrated that equine allogeneic mscs are capable of eliciting antibody responses in vivo, which might be cross-reactive with donor mhc types different to the recipient  <cit> . in our experimental conditions, our results suggest that the significant increase in synovial parameters detected during the first few days after lrs injection could be an inflammatory effect of repeated arthrocentesis. similar results were found by jacobsen et.al.  <cit>  and sanchez teran et.al.  <cit> .

differential inflammatory responsiveness of the joints have also been discussed  <cit> . indeed, the distal interphalangeal joint and tarso-crural joint are more susceptible to reactive arthritis following intra-articular injection  <cit> . in this context, differences in the inflammatory response between autologous bm-mscs and the allogeneic pool of bm-msc treated joints could be due to inter-individual and inter-joint variability. certainly, the autologous injection was made in the tarso-crural joint and allogeneic doses were administered in the radio-carpal joint, which seems to be less prone to inflammatory reaction than the tarso-crural joint  <cit> .

in agreement with other similar trials, our results showed higher wbc and nc increases than those observed for protein values  <cit> . this difference may be due to the kinetics of these two inflammation markers  <cit> . this trend has also been observed in other works analyzing the response of equine synovial fluid to intra-articular injection of different inflammatory stimuli  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our experiments have shown a transitory inflammatory response in all injected equine healthy joints to the administration of autologous, and single and repeat doses of allogeneic mscs pooled from several donors. this situation resolved spontaneously within 10 days post-inoculation. the different conditions in healthy and inflamed joints do not allow to directly extrapolating our results to an articular damage situation. despite this, we suggest based on these findings that repeat intra-articular administration of an allogeneic pool of bm-mscs could be used as a safe strategy, enhancing the mscs availability. the absence of a hypersensitivity response to the second allogeneic bm-mscs injection could also be considered an important contribution to the in vivo transplantation of mscs, since several injections could potentiate the therapeutic benefit of these cells. these results could notably contribute to the development of stem cell based therapies for equine and human joint diseases.
