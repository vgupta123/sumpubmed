BACKGROUND
drug resistant tuberculosis  is one of the main challenges for tb control worldwide due to the emergence of multi-drug resistant  mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> . globally, during the period  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig>  % of new and  <dig>  % of retreated tb cases was estimated to be mdr-tb   <cit> . in  <dig>  an estimated  <dig>  people developed mdr-tb. by  <dig>   <dig> countries had reported cases of extensively drug-resistant tb  defined as mdr-tb plus resistance to at least a fluoroquinolone and an injectable second-line drug. this problem, among others, has led to a reduction in treatment success rate  <cit> .

extensive molecular studies of m. tuberculosis, the tb pathogen, have revealed a very low level of genetic diversity  <cit> . nevertheless, the genotypic variation, especially the bacterial lineages, is associated with variation in transmission capacity and in the propensity to acquire drug resistance . this means that regional variation in the prevalence of specific lineages or sub-lineages can have consequences for the observed epidemiology of tb. studies showed that beijing genotypes have been emerging in vietnam and elsewhere . these genotypes are known to be associated with high prevalence of drug resistance  and high rates of disease transmission  <cit> . it is feared that these genotypes will spread further in the coming years and influence the development of the tb epidemic .

in vietnam, the national tb control program has reported that the prevalence of tb was higher in the south of the country , than in the north  and the center   <cit> . our previous study found that beijing lineage was the most prevalent in northern vietnam, especially in urban areas  <cit> . based on genotyping and epidemiological traits, we suggested that strains of this lineage have been imported and spread within urban areas and from urban to rural areas. this spread of beijing is potentially a major concern, because among other reasons, it may cause the increase of drug-resistant tb. the second most prevalent lineage was eai lineage, and more particularly eai4-vnm sub-lineage, which is specific to vietnam  <cit> . this sub-lineage was found more commonly in isolates taken from patients in rural, compared with urban, areas  <cit> . these findings imply that the genetic spectrum of m. tuberculosis isolates in vietnam is not only distinct from that reported in other nations, but also varies within the country.

tb reference hospitals are at the highest level of tb care in vietnam, where patients from lower levels of the health-care system are referred for management of treatment failures or recurrent tb. as a consequence of this role, these hospitals have a high concentration of patients with drug-resistant tb. we conducted this cross-sectional study in isolates acquired from these hospitals in three main regions to investigate the prevalence of m. tuberculosis lineages and their relation to drug resistance in reference hospitals across vietnam. this molecular epidemiological study is the first investigation of the association between m. tuberculosis lineages/sub-lineages and drug resistance at a country level in vietnam.

methods
sample collection
we acquired 300 m. tuberculosis isolates for which drug susceptibility testing  profiles for the four first-line drugs rifampicin , isoniazid , streptomycin  and ethambutol  were available, from 3 tb reference hospitals in north , south  and centre  of vietnam . the isolates had been collected from patients with treatment failure or recurrent tb during the period  <dig> to  <dig>  in each hospital, the first isolate was selected randomly and the next  <dig> samples were then collected from consecutive patients . during the study period, the tb reference laboratories of the national lung hospital and pham ngoc thach hospital were accredited by the world health organization through an external quality assurance program implemented by the regional supranational laboratory based in adelaide, australia. these laboratories obtained iso 15189: <dig> accreditation in  <dig>  samples collected for the study from hue central hospital were sent to the tb reference laboratory at the national lung hospital for dst.fig.  <dig> study population. note: ref.: reference, mtb: m. tuberculosis, dr: drug resistance



m. tuberculosis lineage identification
all isolates, including the control strains m. tuberculosis h37rv and m. bovis bcg p <dig>  were typed by spoligotyping with a 43-spacer-membrane as previously described  <cit> . the results were entered into the international database “sitvitweb”   <cit> , in order to identify spoligotypes and phylogenetic lineages. lineage/sub-lineage of isolates for which the spoligotypes not found in the sitvitweb database was defined using spotclust   <cit> , and revised by miru-vntrplus   <cit> .

data analyses
logistic regression was used to investigate the association of m. tuberculosis lineages with location, age and sex of the patients and drug resistance levels. each of these variables was considered as a potential confounder for the main effect of the other variables. interactions between variables were tested when biologically meaningful. polynomial regressions were tested in order to consider potential non-linear relationships in the logit function. all the statistical analyses were performed in r  and sas version  <dig>  .

RESULTS
age and sex distribution of patients whose isolates were included
after adjusting for region and m. tuberculosis lineage, it was apparent that the male-to-female ratio differed with age. the proportion of males was higher in patients of working age  and lower in the younger and older patients . the overall male-to-female ratio was  <dig>  .fig.  <dig> the proportion of male patients by age correcting for location and m.tuberculosis lineage. note: the line is the logistic model prediction together with 95 % ci

discussion
the m. tuberculosis lineages from reference hospitals across vietnam
our study showed that the most predominant m. tuberculosis lineage was beijing, especially in the north and the south. compared with a study conducted in isolates exhaustively acquired in the same reference hospitals in the north and the south during  <dig> and the first quarter of  <dig>  which showed beijing strains were emerging  <cit> , the proportion of beijing isolates had increased . as suggested in our previous study, beijing strains would have been imported through international exchanges and migration and spread within urban areas and from urban to rural areas  <cit> . the increase in the proportion of beijing isolates during the 10 years that separate the 1998– <dig> study and the current one was thus expected.

the difference in the proportions of beijing isolates in the centre compared with the north and the south can be explained by the differences in regional characteristics. in particular, the reference hospitals in the north and the south are located in the two most major and largest cities of vietnam, whereas the reference hospital in the centre is located in hue city which is a small city and more isolated in terms of international exchanges and migration. this may reflect the rural and urban disparities in the genetic spectrum of m. tuberculosis isolates as previously documented  <cit> .

our spoligotyping results showed that the m. tuberculosis lineages were globally the same in the three regional hospitals, apart from  <dig> or  <dig> isolates. the m. tuberculosis sample in this study was genetically less diverse than the sample collected at low-level hospitals in the northern plain of vietnam in our previous study  <cit> . in particular, the manu and x lineages, which accounted for  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % respectively in the previous study, were absent from the isolates collected from the regional hospitals.

tb that occurs in young patients is likely to be attributable to recent transmission whereas in older patients it is more likely to be attributable to reactivation of latent tb that was acquired when the person was young  <cit> . hence, the observed association of m. tuberculosis lineage distribution with patients’ ages , which is consistent with previous studies in vietnam  <cit> , suggests a progressive replacement of eai strains with beijing strains in all studied regions. as beijing isolates were less prevalent and eai isolates were more predominant in the centre compared with the north and the south, this replacement seems to be less intensive in the centre. it is noteworthy that in the regions with more intensive replacement, the proportions of eai <dig> isolates out of the total eai isolates were lower than in the region with less intensive replacement . conversely, the proportions of eai4-vnm isolates out of the total eai isolates were higher in the regions with more intensive replacement . this suggests that the eai <dig> sub-lineage was more prone to be replaced compared with the eai4-vnm sub-lineage. the replacement of locally adapted eai strains with beijing strains as seen in this and previous studies suggests, as expected, a particularly higher fitness of beijing strains compared to eai strains in vietnam.

the association of m. tuberculosis lineage and anti-tuberculosis drug resistance in reference hospitals across vietnam
the overall proportions of resistance to the four first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs of the studied m. tuberculosis isolates were the highest for sm  and the lowest for emb . mdr isolates accounted for  <dig>  % of the total. the levels of drug resistance observed in this study were similar to the levels of drug resistance in patients who were being treated for failure or recurrent tb during the national drug resistance survey, conducted in  <dig>  <cit> . this is consistent with the strategic role of reference hospitals in the vietnam national tb program.

as the vietnam national tb program has been using genexpert for mdr-tb case detection, the high proportion  of inh resistant isolates that are also resistant to rmp in our study suggests that this strategy is reliable.

our analysis shows that the prevalence of drug resistance was lower in the centre than in the rest of the country and was not significantly different between the north and the south. this is explained by the lower proportion of beijing isolates and the higher proportion of eai isolates in the centre than the rest of the country and the finding that beijing isolates are more likely to be drug-resistant than eai isolates. this finding suggests that the ongoing replacement of eai lineage by beijing lineage in vietnam also means a replacement of the most drug-susceptible strains by highly drug-resistant strains. therefore, not withstanding acquired resistance caused by tb treatment, a higher rate of drug resistant tb can be foreseen in the near future. the empirical evidence to justify this concern is the increased rate of mdr-tb, as shown in consecutive national drug resistance surveys, from  <dig>  % to 4 % among new cases and from 19 % to  <dig>  % in retreatment cases between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> .

in the south, both the beijing lineage and the eai lineage were associated with a high likelihood of being drug-resistant. this latter lineage was least likely to be associated with drug resistance in the north and the centre. the eai4-vnm sub-lineage was reported to be the predominant one  in a study conducted in  <dig> rural districts in the south of vietnam  <cit> , with a prevalence almost twice as high as the one in rural districts in the north of vietnam  <cit> . in this study eai/ eai4-vnm isolates were found to have very different levels of drug resistance in the three regions. this lineage/sub-lineage was among the most drug-resistant lineages in the south but was the most sensitive in the north and the centre. this implies that these strains are also epidemiologically important and need to be monitored, and there would be a higher antibiotic pressure in the south compared to the north and the center.

the observation association between male-to-female ratio and patients’ age for the studied m. tuberculosis isolates was similar to the finding of the national tb prevalence survey of vietnam conducted during 2006– <dig>  this survey also showed that the male-to-female ratio for prevalent tb was higher in patients of working ages  and lower in the younger and older patients  <cit> . the high overall male-to-female ratio in this study is also consistent with findings of the prevalence survey and other previous studies in which the male-to-female ratio was between  <dig> – <dig>   <cit> . these findings demonstrate that the observed gender difference in this study population is not an artefact of sample collection from the reference hospitals or related to gender differences in access to diagnosis and treatment, but it is actually a feature of epidemiology of tb in vietnam in general.

for all the tested drugs, the proportions of drug-resistant isolates were higher in patients of middle age groups , highest for patients of 37– <dig> years old and lower in patients of younger and older ages. furthermore, the proportions of mdr and emb resistant strains were significantly higher in men compared to women. these findings are different from those of a study conducted in georgia among hospitalized tb patients, which failed to show any association between drug resistance and age  <cit> . this study also showed that female patients were more at risk of having mdr-tb than male patients. these differences suggest that control strategies should be adapted for different settings. studies in developing countries showed that male tb patients tend to have poorer treatment compliance than female ones due to neglected treatment, alcoholism and fear of losing jobs, especially the ones of the middle age groups  <cit> . this problem could lead to higher level of drug resistance among male tb patients. in order to achieve better control over the emergence of mdr-tb in vietnam, it is important to focus on improving treatment compliance among male patients of working ages.

CONCLUSIONS
this first study on the molecular epidemiology of tb in tb reference hospitals across regions of vietnam shows that beijing and eai lineages were the most epidemiologically important ones, not only because they are the most predominant lineages/sub-lineages but also because they are the most likely to be drug-resistant lineages in one  or all regions of vietnam . the replacement of eai strains by beijing strains, especially in the north and in the centre can be expected to lead to a higher prevalence of drug resistant tb in vietnam in the near future. male patients of working ages should be particularly targeted in order to prevent the emergence of drug resistant tb.
