BACKGROUND
a rna sequence is classified as a long non-coding rna  if it lacks coding potential and has a length > <dig> base pairs   <cit> . many lncrnas have been shown to play a role in development and diseases  <cit> . additionally, studies on mouse and human have reported that lncrna genes are similar to protein coding genes in that they contain promoters and transcribed regions. upon transcription, these regions will have active chromatin signatures such as the tri-methylation of histone h <dig> lysine  <dig>  and the tri-methylation of histone h <dig> lysine  <dig>  . it has also been revealed that lncrna expression may require specific binding of transcription factors to drive rna polymerase ii -mediated transcription .

in drosophila melanogaster, some lncrnas have been observed to regulate developmental processes. for example, rox <dig> and rox <dig> recruit the msl  chromatin remodelling complex to genes on the male x chromosome, but not the autosomes or the female x chromosomes, to increase the acetylation of histone h4k <dig>  <cit> . this regulation can coordinate the dosage compensation required for male development. while the functionality of some lncrnas in fruit fly was known, some lncrnas have not yet been functionally characterized.

transcriptional direction is an important characteristic in lncrnas. the transcripts of lncrnas are able to disrupt the transcription of coding genes, a phenomenon known as convergent transcription in which the transcriptional direction of the lncrna and the mrna are head-to-head against each other  <cit> . conversely, for divergent transcription, the lncrna/mrna gene pair exhibit coordinated changes in transcription  <cit> . in this regard, the direction of lncrna transcription is an important feature to be annotated. another essential characteristic is the exon regions.

to assess the current state of lncrna annotation in the fruit fly, we collected known drosophila melanogaster lncrnas from databases and the literature, and then used strand-specific rna-seq datasets  to add to the characterization of the annotations. the collected lncrnas contained approximately  <dig> genes. to investigate whether many more lncrnas could be discovered, we obtained additional rna-seq datasets from the brain . we selected the brain, instead of the whole body, because many lncrnas were tissue-specific according to lncrna studies in mammals  <cit> . also, the brain is important for studying neuron-related diseases. since some lncrnas may not contain poly tails, both poly-enriched and ribo-zero libraries were constructed in this study. for the purpose of discovering novel lncrnas, we developed a reference-based assembly approach to identify potential lncrna transcripts.table  <dig> summary statistics of datasets used in study

detailed information of these datasets can be seen in additional file 3: table s <dig> and table s5



the next question addressed in this study is whether rna-seq is a reliable platform for the discovery of novel lncrnas. a previous study used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing  data of chromatin signatures to detect active transcription of lncrnas  <cit> . thus, we integrated multiple sets of rna-seq and chip-seq data  to investigate transcription of lncrnas during the development of d. melanogaster. we observed that a large proportion of genomic regions for lncrnas expressed in rna-seq were not occupied by chromatin signatures  that are usually associated with active transcription. however, no studies have discussed which feature  is better for inferring the existence of lncrnas. to answer this question, we designed experiments of quantitative reverse transcriptase-dependent polymerase chain reaction  to evaluate the confidence level of lncrnas discovered from rna-seq. in summary, this study aims to demonstrate that ambitious integration of sequencing data followed by computational procedures can largely facilitate novel lncrna discovery as well as enhance lncrna annotation.

RESULTS
curated lncrnas in d. melanogaster
in this study, a non-redundant set of  <dig> lncrna genes  from flybase   <cit>  and the ucsc genome browser  <cit>  was first constructed. next, the long intergenic non-coding rnas  reported in the study by young et al.  <cit>  and brown et al.  <cit>  were collected to expand the list. among the  <dig> lincrnas reported by young et al. and the  <dig> lncrnas by brown et al., some potentially redundant lincrnas or lncrnas were excluded by a selection procedure . in the end,  <dig> lincrna genes  from young et al. and  <dig> lncrna genes  form brown et al. were added to the non-redundant set reported in the present study.

additionally, we developed an approach to discover lncrnas from the brain-specific rna-seq datasets of fruit fly produced in this study , which were obtained using two types of library construction, the poly-enriched and ribo-zero protocols. the proposed pipeline consists of several steps, including reference-based assembly , coding potential estimation, ribosomal rna exclusion, and read remapping . the results consisted of  <dig> intergenic transcripts that have not been previously annotated. after excluding transcripts with lengths less than 200 bp,  <dig> transcripts remained as putative lncrnas. then, we retained  <dig> putative lncrna genes which showed a low potential to encode proteins. after excluding ribosomal rna contamination,  <dig> putative lncrna transcripts remained. we further excluded  <dig> transcripts that had no sufficient read support during the follow-up read remapping. before finalizing the list, we compared the discovered lncrnas with the most updated gene annotations from ucsc genome browser , and removed  <dig> transcripts that overlapped some newly reported coding genes in the sense direction. finally, we obtained  <dig> novel lncrna transcripts that have not been reported previously. to investigate the validity of the discovered lncrnas,  <dig> novel lncrna genes were selected for rt-qpcr experiments applied on fly brains. in fig.  <dig>  the results showed that  <dig> novel lncrna genes have adequate expression . for the five lncrnas of which the expression was not clear , we doubled the amount of template brain cdna and performed rt-qpcr again on these five low-expressed lncrna genes. in the second rt-qpcr validation experiment, seven flybase lncrna genes that were believed to be expressed in brains and three flybase lncrna genes that were believed to be unexpressed in brains were also included for comparison. the ten flybase lncrnas were selected according to the rpkm values from our poly-enriched rna-seq data of brain . the results in fig.  <dig> revealed that the expressed and unexpressed flybase lncrna genes showed distinct values in rt-qpcr experiments. when compared with the three unexpressed flybase lncrna genes, the five novel lncrna genes were also considered expressed in brains.fig.  <dig> rt-qpcr experiments for a selected set of lncrnas in brains. a  <dig> novel lncrnas discovered in the present study were selected for validation. rpl <dig>  and rox <dig>  were included as positive controls. the horizontal line indicated − delta ct ≥  <dig>  the rectangle indicated the five lncrnas with considerably low expression, and was tested again by the second rt-qpcr experiment shown in . b the five lncrnas from the rectangle of  were tested again by rt-qpcr with twofold amount of template cdna. ten flybase lncrnas were included for comparison. the three flybase lncrnas highlighted by the orange stars were selected because their rpkm values in our brain rna-seq data was 0



in total, a set of  <dig> curated lncrna genes  in d. melanogaster was constructed in this study . the average length of the curated lncrna transcripts is 1008 bp with a diverse range. more than 97 % of the lncrna transcripts have lengths from 200 bp to 4000 bp .

improving the annotation of the lncrnas reported by young et al
young et al.  <cit>  reported  <dig> lincrnas for d. melanogaster in  <dig>  but provided no detailed information because the rna-sequencing reads were not generated with a strand-specific library construction  <cit> . in this study, we collected the original  <dig> rna-seq datasets  <cit>  used by young et al.  and adopted  <dig> additional stranded poly-enriched rna-seq datasets at different developmental stages  to determine the exon regions and transcriptional directions for the lincrnas reported in young et al.’s study. after excluding redundant lincrnas against the annotated lncrnas from the databases and removed transcripts which are no longer lincrnas in the current flybase annotations ,  <dig> lincrna genes remained. to identify the exon regions of these  <dig> lincrna genes, we remapped the  <dig> rna-seq datasets to the lincrna sequences using cufflinks  <cit> . we found that most of lincrna genes from young et al. consisted of only one or very few exons . as for transcriptional direction, similar procedures were conducted. we annotated the direction of transcription in about 67 % of the  <dig> lincrna genes from the study by young et al. . to be more specific,  <dig> lincrna genes were identified on the positive strand and  <dig> on the negative strand of the fruit fly genome .table  <dig> statistics of transcriptional direction in the lncrna genes from different sources. the mrna information was downloaded from the ucsc genome browser 



utilizing additional rna-seq datasets to improve the annotation of the  <dig> curated lncrna transcripts
we utilized the rna-seq datasets from multiple sources as well as those generated in this study to improve the annotation of the curated lncrnas. three properties were emphasized here:  the classification of a lncrna in terms of its genome location and transcriptional direction;  whether the lncrna is expressed in the brain or not; and  whether the lncrna has a poly tail or not.

the lncrnas collected in the present study were classified into several groups according to their genome locations with respect to the closest adjacent coding gene. for lncrnas located in regions that overlap with coding genes, the transcriptional direction was also considered to be an essential aspect for classification. in this regard, lncrnas are classified into anti-sense exonic, sense exonic, anti-sense intronic and sense intronic lncrnas, according to the transcriptional direction with respect to the overlapping coding gene. among the curated  <dig> lncrna transcripts,  <dig> were classified as intergenic lncrna transcripts,  <dig> as exonic lncrna transcripts  and  <dig> as intronic lncrna transcripts. there were  <dig> lncrna transcripts for which the transcriptional direction could not be determined and were classified as ‘unknown’. table  <dig> shows that the number of lncrnas for the four groups decreased as follows: anti-sense exonic lncrnas > anti-sense intronic lncrnas > sense exonic lncrnas > sense intronic lncrnas. the lncrna numbers of the four groups in the different euchromatin regions were also provided . here, we only considered lncrnas located in euchromatin because most lncrnas were expressed from the euchromatin in fruit fly.table  <dig> types of lncrna transcripts

additionally, this study provided two sets of sequencing reads of rna samples from the brain . with the two datasets, we could infer which lncrnas were expressed in the brain. if the criterion ‘rpkm > 1’ was used, the data revealed that about one third of lncrnas  were expressed in the brain. in fig.  <dig> we showed the rt-qpcr experiments of seven lncrna genes with rpkm >  <dig> and three lncrna genes with rpkm =  <dig>  the rt-qpcr results showed that the − delta ct values of the seven lncrna genes with ‘rpkm > 1’ were distinguishable from the three lncrna genes with ‘rpkm = 0’. in this regard, ‘rpkm > 1’ is considered as a safe criterion to infer the expression of lncrnas in the brain. next, we further examined whether a lncrna contains the poly tail. both poly-enriched and ribo-zero library constructions were used in the present study because some lncrnas were previously found to contain no poly tails in mammals . among the  <dig> lncrna transcripts observed in the brain rna-seq data, there were  <dig> lncrna transcripts with a high probability of not containing poly tails when expressed in the brain .

supporting evidence for the collected and the newly discovered lncrnas
existing data of chromatin signatures and expression profiles of d. melanogaster were applied to examine the associated chromatin modifications and the expression levels of lncrnas. for each lncrna, the presence of transcription-related chromatin signatures was provided in additional file  <dig> 

expression profiles
to quantify the expression level of lncrnas, the rpkm value of every lncrna transcript at each developmental stage was calculated along with the averaged values of all lncrna molecules and the averaged values of all mrna molecules. figure  <dig> shows that mrna, on average, had ~8-fold higher expression than lncrna at each developmental stage. moreover, fig.  <dig> shows that the numbers of transcripts expressed at the developmental stages are similar to those reported in the original study  <cit> . on average, lncrna molecules occupied ~ <dig>  % of all transcripts expressed at the developmental stages.fig.  <dig> expression profiles at different developmental stages of fruit fly. a averaged rpkm values at different developmental stages for lncrnas and mrnas. b numbers of expressed transcripts  at different developmental stages for lncrnas and mrnas, respectively



chromatin signatures
in the set of curated lncrnas,  <dig> of the  <dig> lncrna genes with well-defined transcriptional direction had a detectable h3k4me <dig> signal at the proximal region of the genes . in addition,  <dig> lncrna genes had detectable h3k36me <dig> signals, covering, on average, ~70 % of the transcribed regions. we also examined the pol ii chip-seq data and found that  <dig>  lncrna genes had pol ii signals with an average coverage of ~60 % over the transcribed regions. in summary,  <dig> lncrna genes showed ‘k4–k36’ and pol ii signatures, strongly suggesting that these lncrnas were epigenetically regulated like protein coding genes. we were aware of the possibility that the chromatin signatures assigned to the lncrna genes were actually associated with the overlapped coding genes. there are  <dig> sense exonic/intronic lncrna genes that may encounter such a situation.fig.  <dig> analysis of chromatin signatures  in the curated lncrna genes



in combination with the information of expression profiles and chromatin signatures, we found that a large proportion of expressed lncrna transcripts  were not occupied by h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig> and pol ii chromatin signatures, which are believed to be present in the actively transcribed regions. the inconsistency between chromatin signatures and rna-seq expression raises the question as to whether the identified lncrnas were really transcribed or not. we addressed this issue in the following paragraph.

experimental validation of a selected set of lncrnas by rt-qpcr
to investigate whether the collected lncrna genes were indeed actively transcribed, we used rt-qpcr to detect the expression of a selected set of lncrnas in adult male flies. a set of lncrnas expressed in adult male flies  were selected and divided into four groups according to two properties:  lncrnas with all of the three chromatin signatures  or without any of the three chromatin signatures, and  lncrnas with high expression  or with low expression . in each group, at least  <dig> lncrnas were randomly selected to be validated with rt-qpcr. the four groups were defined as  high expression with chromatin signatures ,  low expression with chromatin signatures ,  high expression without chromatin signatures  and  low expression without chromatin signatures . surprisingly, the transcripts of almost all lncrna genes  were detectable except for one lncrna gene in g <dig> and one lncrna gene in g <dig> . among the validated lncrna genes, three lincrna genes  were discovered by young et al.  <cit>  and five lncrna genes  were reported by the present study. the rt-qpcr results confirmed that most of the lncrna genes identified by rna-seq are not transcriptional noise. furthermore, our results suggested that the lack of associated h3k4me <dig>  h3k36me <dig> and pol ii signatures might not directly imply no active transcription of lncrnas, since most of the expressed lncrna genes without these three chromatin signatures  were successfully detected by rt-qpcr.fig.  <dig> rt-qpcr experiments of a selected set of lncrnas in male adults. g1: high expression with chromatin signatures ; g2: low expression with chromatin signatures ; g3: high expression without chromatin signatures ; and g4: low expression without chromatin signatures . three negative controls  were all around zero. stars were used to highlight the lncrnas that were not from the databases . the horizontal line indicated the cutoff  used to define a validated lncrna. green stars: the transcripts that are now annotated as other types of transcripts by flybase, and thus were removed from the list of the curated lncrnas in the present study



discussion
in this study, we compiled an up-to-date list of fruit fly lncrnas from databases and literature and found that the number of known lncrna genes in fruit fly  was much smaller than those reported in human  and mouse   <cit> . we suspected that the set of known lncrnas in fruit fly was far from exhaustive. indeed,  <dig> novel lncrna genes were discovered when two brain-specific rna-seq datasets were produced in the present study. thus, more lncrna genes will likely be found when more rna-seq studies of fruit fly are conducted in the future.

in order to discover lncrnas that do not contain poly tails, we have developed a computational approach to identify novel lncrnas by integrating sequencing read datasets from two different library construction protocols, the poly-enriched and ribo-zero protocols. this approach can be applied to future studies for the same purpose. the final set of curated fly lncrnas contain  <dig> lncrna genes , which is larger than the  <dig> lncrna genes in flybase , and the  <dig> lncrna transcripts recently reported by matthews et al.  <cit> . our final list is also larger than the latest version  of a well-known lncrna database, noncode   <cit> . the present study also demonstrated that novel lncrnas can be found in a tissue-specific manner, as suggested by a previous study in mammals  <cit> . we found that 33 % of the  <dig> lncrna genes were expressed in the brain, when the criterion ‘rpkm > 1’ was used. this number is considerably higher than that observed in other tissues reported by brown et al.  <cit> . the study of brown et al. incorporated rna-seq data from  <dig> types of tissues and the testis tissue showed the highest number of expressed lncrna genes .

to investigate the quality of the lincrnas discovered in the present study, we conducted three analyses and selected a set of lincrna genes for rt-qpcr validation to investigate the reliability of these newly discovered lncrnas. for a lncrna, it was examined whether  it was observed to be expressed in the collected rna-seq datasets from developmental stages;  it was predicted with a low coding probability by another predictor; and  it was not predicted to contain any conserved domains of proteins. as shown in additional file  <dig>   <dig>  % of the  <dig> novel lncrna genes discovered from fly brain were also observed expressed in at least three developmental stages. in the proposed workflow of discovering lncrnas, we applied a svm-based prediction tool, coding potential calculator   <cit> , to filter out potential coding sequences. here, we applied another tool for estimating coding potential, coding-potential assessment tool   <cit> , on the discovered lncrnas. the result  showed that only seven transcripts were with a coding probability ≥  <dig> . this cutoff threshold  <dig>  was an optimum cutoff for fruit fly suggested by wang et al.  <cit> , where 96 % of fly coding genes were shown to have a coding probability ≥  <dig>  . moreover, the results of invoking rps-blast showed that only nine newly discovered lncrna transcripts might contain conserved domains from the conserved domains database , as shown in additional file  <dig> as well. finally, the rt-qpcr validation for the selected novel lincrna genes suggested that all of the  <dig> novel lincrna genes were shown to be expressed in brains when compared with the negative controls . this reveals the reliability of the discovered novel lncrna genes.

in the curated list, we observed that there are some lncrna transcripts from different sources partially sharing common genomic regions. these lncrna transcripts might be in fact the same lncrna, might be different splicing forms of a single lncrna gene, or might be actually independent lncrna genes. we realized that it remained difficult to learn the fact and determine the exact boundaries for these putative lncrnas based on the limited information collected so far. before a mature methodology can be developed, manual examination on rna-seq data in a genome browser is highly recommended. we highlighted the overlap information in additional file  <dig> to remind the readers that more investigations on such lncrnas are needed. in addition, we also observed that the types of lncrna transcripts  would potentially be changed once the annotation of protein-coding genes is updated. as the loci and boundaries of protein-coding genes continue to be refined, noncoding rnas originally classified as intergenic may be found to be exonic, intronic or even become a new splicing form of a coding gene. some of the young et al. lincrnas have been found by a follow-up flybase analysis  to overlap utrs and are probably not lncrnas. therefore, the readers should be aware that the number of exonic sense lncrnas in the curated list might be inflated by these lncrnas.

this study used additional rna-seq data from the modencode database to improve the annotation regarding transcriptional direction  and the number of exons . when comparing lncrnas with fruit fly mrnas, we found that about half of the curated lncrna genes were transcribed in the positive strands and half in the negative strands . for each specific group of the lncrna transcripts in table  <dig>  the lncrna transcripts were equally derived from both strands. moreover,  <dig> lncrna genes  were found to be transcribed in a direction antisense to protein coding genes. this number is larger than that  reported in human  <cit> . again, by the follow-up flybase analysis , some of the young et al. lincrnas have been found to actually consist of two or more independent lncrna genes which map to opposite strands. we observed that the characterization process performed in the present study failed to clarify these cases based on the stranded rna-seq data collected so far. in this regard, the readers should be aware that such complicated cases were not easily to be discovered automatically by the proposed computational approach, and might be still present in the remaining  <dig> young et al. lincrna genes curated in the list. as for the number of exons in lncrnas, fruit fly lncrnas tend to have fewer exons than mrnas , which is consistent with the observation in rat by wang et al.  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows that ~60 % of mrnas contain no more than five exons. the percentage of mrnas with different exon numbers were roughly equally distributed . in contrast, ~94 % of lncrnas contain one to three exons, and more than half of the lncrnas contain only single exon. the exon numbers of lncrnas were apparently smaller than that of mrnas. it is not clear whether this was because the average length of the curated lncrnas  is shorter than that of mrnas . additionally, in table  <dig>  we showed that intergenic lncrnas were the major type of lncrnas that contained only one exon.fig.  <dig> distribution of exon numbers in the lncrna/mrna genes



next, we utilized the peak detection results of  <dig> cage datasets from the study of brown et al. to investigate the 5’ end completeness of the curated lncrna transcripts. the result showed that about ~55 % of the curated lncrna transcripts can find a cage peak within the ±50-bps region with respect to the 5’ end of lncrna transcripts . generally speaking, our study shows that integrating multiple public datasets provides useful information for fly lncrnas.

in the present study, the influence of rna-seq data with two different types of library constructions, poly-enriched and ribo-zero libraries, was also investigated. the data showed that  <dig> lncrna transcripts were only detected in the reads from the ribo-zero library, but not in the reads from the poly-enriched library. this indicates that some lncrna transcripts do not contain poly tails when they are expressed in the brain. such lncrna transcripts can be detected only by the ribo-zero library construction.

moreover, to study whether the lncrnas reported by rna-seq were associated with chromatin modifications, we collected chip-seq datasets of the three chromatin signatures, h3k36me <dig>  h3k4me <dig> and pol ii, which are known to be strongly associated with active transcription . the collected datasets involved samples from embryos, larvae, pupae and adults of d. melanogaster, with the exception of h3k36me <dig> datasets in which pupae were not found. furthermore, rna-seq datasets of fly samples at different developmental stages were included to quantify the expression of lncrnas. we found that a large proportion of the expressed lncrnas  were not occupied by chromatin signatures . this observation raised the question of whether rna-seq is a reliable platform for detecting transcription of lncrnas, because false detection of lncrnas might happen due to contaminated genomic dna during library construction. as both the inference of lncrna expression and signatures of active transcription were obtained using high-throughput technologies, we used rt-qpcr to detect the transcription of lncrnas.

in the rt-qpcr experiments, we selected  <dig> lncrna genes reported by rna-seq. the results revealed that most lncrna genes  were indeed present at the chosen stage  of the fruit flies . two known lncrna genes expressed in male adults, rox <dig> and rox <dig>  <cit> , were also validated by rt-qpcr. these observations provided strong support that rna-seq is a reliable tool to identify lncrna genes. in addition, we divided the  <dig> selected lncrna genes into four groups with all possible combinatorial conditions of chromatin signatures  and expression . the data showed that in all four groups, all lncrna genes except two with low expression could be successfully detected by rt-qpcr. this observation held even for the expressed lncrna genes that had none of the three chromatin signatures. however, it should be noted that the collected chip-seq datasets were not sampled from the stages as precisely as the rna-seq datasets, which were collected from  <dig> time points  during the development of d. melanogaster. the inconsistency between rna-seq and chip-seq data may be because the collected chip-seq data were not extensive. in particular, chip data of h3k36me <dig> sampled from pupae was not found during data collection.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have developed a procedure to discover novel lncrnas using rna-seq technology, and used a large number of rna-seq datasets as well as lncrna databases and chip-seq datasets to improve the annotation of lncrnas in fruit fly. from these efforts, we have provided an enlarged set of d. melanogaster lncrnas, including known lncrnas and novel lncrnas from the two tissue-specific rna-seq datasets generated in this study. the novel lncrnas we identified suggests that many fruit fly lncrnas remain to be identified. moreover, we have also improved the annotation of the curated lncrnas regarding transcriptional direction, exon regions, classification, expression in the brain, possession of a poly tail, and presence of conventional chromatin signatures by utilizing the strand-specific rna-seq and the chip-seq datasets from the modencode database and data from the present study. through rt-qpcr experiments, we demonstrate that rna-seq is a reliable platform to discover lncrnas. in summary, the present study provided a firm foundation for studying the functions of lncrnas in drosophila.

with the improved annotation of transcriptional direction, researchers can possibly retrieve the promoter regions of lncrnas and investigate the potential regulators that regulate lncrna expression. moreover, this information can be used to investigate the co-expression relationships between lncrnas and coding genes in order to further understand the functional roles of the set of curated lncrnas. in conclusion, the present study has integrated many rna-seq and chip-seq datasets to increase the compilation breadth and annotation detail of lncrnas. the set of curated lncrnas along with improved annotation can serve as an important resource in lncrna studies.
