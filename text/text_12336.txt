BACKGROUND
cancer is a genetic disease caused by the accumulation of tumor-specific  mutations in two broadly defined types of genes called tumor suppressors and oncogenes   <cit> ). in general, mutations in tumor suppressors tend to inactivate these natural repressors of tumorgenesis. mutations in cellular proto-oncogenes, on the other hand, typically increase or deregulate the activity of their protein products. the existence of different types of genes and mutations in cancer has significant practical implications for developing targeted therapies in cancer care. so far, pharmacological restoration of tumor suppression function has been challenging: better success has been achieved by inhibiting activated oncogenes   <cit> ). in addition to representing potential therapeutic targets, activating mutations can also be used as biomarkers to identify populations likely to respond to therapies targeting the mutated genes. there is therefore significant interest in identifying those mutations necessary for the cancer phenotype , separating the driver mutations from the random  mutations that occur as a consequence of the genetic instability typical for human tumors   <cit> ), and furthermore distinguishing activating mutations from inactivating mutations.

several methods have been developed for the automated prediction of driver oncogenic mutations in individual genes, yet few are suitable for detecting activating mutations. the most straightforward method predicts that driver mutations have a large number of mutations relative to the estimated background mutational rate, after normalizing for gene size   <cit> ; see also the "standard test" in supplementary information for ding et al.   <cit> ). another popular approach predicts that driver mutations have a higher frequency of non-synonymous mutations relative to the background mutation rate   <cit> ; yang et al.   <cit> ; samuels et al.   <cit> ; davies et al.   <cit> ; greenman et al.   <cit> ; sjöblom et al.   <cit> ). these methods are typically used to estimate the total fraction of driver mutations or to detect driver genes, but like predictions based on the phylogenic conservation of protein sequences   <cit>  and refs. therein), they cannot distinguish between inactivating and activating mutations. in addition, these methods are less suitable to identify driver genes that have low mutation frequencies. meanwhile, approaches that model the destabilizing effects of mutations on protein structure   <cit>  and refs. therein) are more suitable for tumor suppressor genes. perhaps the most reliable approach is to classify mutations based on prior knowledge from functional studies, but functional information is by definition not available for novel or poorly characterized genes.

we propose an alternative approach to detect activating mutations in oncogenes, based on the hypothesis that only a small number of specific mutations can activate a protein. to be precise, we hypothesize that a localized cluster of amion acid mutations within a protein sequence, especially in the absence of obvious mutational hotspots, is a fingerprint of selection for the oncogenic phenotype associated with activating driver mutations. evolutionary studies demonstrate that most amino acids replacements are either neutral or incompatible with protein function   <cit> ). thus, activating mutations should concentrate in a small subset of protein positions and domains, while passenger mutations can be distributed more evenly along the protein sequence reflecting random chance and differences in the mutability of individual dna codons. consistent with this hypothesis, activating somatic amino acid mutations cluster in protein kinases   <cit> ; samuels.   <cit> ; torkamani and schork   <cit> ).

several methods in the statistics literature can be applied to detect mutation clusters. for example, naus   <cit>  proposed a statistical test for the maximum number of points in a fixed length cluster on a line, and developed the probability and expectation. shortly thereafter, naus   <cit>  compared the power of two nonrandom clustering tests on a line; one test is the maximum number of points in a fixed-length non-overlapping interval  and another is the maximum number of points in a fixed-length running interval , which is also called scan statistics. scan statistics were further developed and applied by balakrishnan and koutras   <cit> , and glaz and zhang   <cit>  generalized the fixed-length restriction to allow variable-length intervals by determining the maximum of a series of scan statistics each with a fixed window length. while naus's approach and scan statistics with fixed or variable window lengths are useful, a further generalization to an arbitrary number of points in the interval is more flexible and useful to identify activating driver mutations.

in this work a new statistics method is introduced that identifies nonrandom mutation clustering without specifying the number of mutations or the cluster length. the exact and approximate distribution of the statistical measure is derived and a nonrandom mutation clustering  algorithm is developed based on the measure. we confirmed the utility of this approach by detecting well-known activating mutations in kras, braf, pi3k, and β-catenin oncogenes, as well as gain-of-function mutations in several tumor suppressors.

data description
data used in this study are from cosmic  database version  <dig>   <cit> ) via http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic. to ensure compatibility with the test assumption that the location of amino acid mutations on a protein follows a uniform distribution, we limit our analysis to studies annotated as whole gene screens in cosmic; this eliminated a great majority of cosmic studies annotated as partial or with missing information on the full-gene screen status. furthermore, the cluster analysis is restricted to missense mutations: nonsense and synonymous changes are excluded. we limited our search to confirmed somatic variants or mutations that were reported in other studies as somatic. finally, we removed redundancy in mutations in cancer cell lines, since cell line mutations are often reported by several independent studies.

nonrandom clusters in cancer genes
using the nmc algorithm ,  <dig> different proteins out of  <dig> contain nonrandom amino acid mutation clusters with cutoff probability of less than  <dig> , with the most significant clusters listed in table  <dig> . the clusters include well-known mutation hotspots in classical oncogenes such as braf, ras genes, pi3k, erbb2/her <dig>  and ctnnb1/β-catenin. interestingly, nonrandom amino acid mutation clusters were also identified in genes not considered to be classical oncogenes and even a few tumor suppressors. interpretation of selected positive controls is described below in more detail.

the number of mutations for each position is shown in parenthesis, positions within clusters from table  <dig> are highlighted in bold, and cpg positions are underlined.

for most genes in table  <dig>  multiple significant amino acid clusters were found, with the most significant clusters in sites of well-known oncogenic mutations. interestingly, the great majority of the mutation-hotspots are not in cpg positions  suggesting that selection and not the underlying mutation rate drives these changes in tumors.

general remarks on detected mutation hotspots
in addition to known clusters of activating mutations in major oncogenes, several other genes have significant mutation hot-spots. for example, two mutations between the roc  and kinase domains in the lrrk <dig> locus form a significant cluster. the lrrk <dig> kinase, also known as park <dig>  is not considered to be a classical cancer gene. it most closely resembles the family of tyrosine-like kinases that phosphorylate serine/threonine residues and lies upstream of mitogen-activated protein kinase  pathways   <cit> ). interestingly, germline polymorphisms in lrrk <dig> predispose affected individuals to parkinson disease and are linked to specific cancer types   <cit> ; strongosky et al.   <cit> ).

as expected, we found fewer significant mutation hot-spots in tumor suppressors, and these hot-spots were typically much larger than those associated with oncogenes. in general, inactivating amino acid mutations are not expected to form localized nonrandom clusters, but rather to span many residues in highly conserved regions   <cit> ). the most significant cluster identified in tp53/p <dig> spans residues 132- <dig>  one of the four major p <dig> mutation hotspots that are highly conserved in vertebrates   <cit> ). it overlaps the original major hotspot in residues 110- <dig> identified by hollstein et al.   <cit> , and spans two shorter hotspots that include gain-of-function mutations in positions  <dig> and  <dig>   <cit> ). structural analysis demonstrates that both regions are close together in the folded protein . the cluster found in the phosphatase and tensin-homology domains of pten includes residues known to inhibit pten phosphatase activity   <cit> ), and sequence conservation cannot explain this clustering since most of the pten protein is well conserved among vertebrates   <cit> ). these examples demonstrate that tumor suppressor activity can be muted by changes in protein function in addition to gene deletions or disruption of the reading frame.

CONCLUSIONS
a new method for the identification of nonrandom mutation clusters in biological sequences is presented. the method is fast, robust, and unlike many previous methods, it is does not require a fixed window length, which enables the identification of significant clusters of variable sizes, particularly important for the detection of activating mutations. we have applied this method to investigate somatic amino acid mutations in the cosmic database. our method detected very short clusters spanning a few individual amino acid positions in the case of the oncogenes braf or kras, as well as larger regions in the tumor suppressors p <dig> and pten.

a recent paper by wagner   <cit>  proposed two similar approaches using the distance between mutation positions. in the first approach, a poisson distribution was utilized to model mutation clusters. the test on the distance of mutation positions containing k mutations was derived and the minimum k that gives significance was determined. the second approach assumed a uniform hypothesis and used permutation testing for significance. the permutation test is an approximation whose precision depends on the number of permutations undertaken, which can be very computationally intensive for good accuracy and precision. by comparison, our measure on distance is based on a uniform distribution and is calculated directly via order statistics.

our method has several potential limitations. first of all, the status of all coding positions must be determined. this is primarily a limitation for older studies, where typically only those exons with known mutations were screened. however, with the explosion of large-scale cancer genome sequencing   <cit> ; greenman et al   <cit> ; jones et al.   <cit> ; parsons et al.   <cit> ; cancer genome atlas research network.   <cit> ), the number of studies suitable for analysis by nmc will grow. another limitation is our assumption that the mutation probability is uniform: hypermutable positions for both germline and somatic mutations have been reported. as a result, we have excluded all insertions and deletions, since these mutations have strong sequence-dependence, and restricted analysis to single-point amino acid substitutions. examples of single point mutation hotspots are cpg dinucleotides, which in unselected genomic sequences have more than ten-fold higher mutation frequency compared to other dinucleotides   <cit> ). cpg hypermutability has been also reported in certain tumors   <cit> ). however, as shown in table  <dig>  only a few of the activating mutations identified by the nmc algorithm are in cpg sites. another potential bias can be introduced by an unequal rate of mutagenesis caused by deficient repair of dna damage in cells and environmental mutagens. for instance, tobacco smoke preferentially induces g to t transversions in dna in lung cancer while colorectal tumors exhibit more transitions than transversions   <cit> ). yet, despite the fact that lung and colorectal tumors have different mutational spectra, essentially all kras mutations in these tumors occur in residues  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  in summary, while our analysis is affected by nonrandom factors such as the presence of mutation hotspots or exposure to different mutagens, positive selection for a cancer phenotype appears to be the major cause of mutation clustering.

the aim of the method is to detect activating mutations that are assumed to be concentrated in specific amino acid positions. activating mutations are typical for cellular proto-oncogenes and, as expected, significant clusters are detected in oncogenes such as braf, ras genes, ctnnb1/β-catenin, or pi3k. less intuitive, however, are positively selected residues in the p <dig> and pten tumor suppressors. previous reports revealed that these genes encode functional domains that can result in gain-of--function when altered by mutation. thus, our method may also identify positive selection on mutations that alter the repressive function of tumor suppressors.

in conclusion, we propose a new method for discovering nonrandom clusters of mutations in biological sequences. unlike previous approaches, the method does not use fixed length windows and therefore can be used to detect clusters of highly variable sizes. we demonstrated the value of this method to detect activating amino acid mutations in human tumors and confirmed nonrandom clustering of well-known oncogenic mutations in several classical oncogenes. the method can be also used to discover new oncogenes from large-scale cancer genome data and to identify gain-of-function mutations in tumor suppressors. finally, detection of nonrandom sequence changes is a general problem and the method may be useful in other areas such as dna polymorphism analysis and comparative evolutionary studies   <cit> ).
