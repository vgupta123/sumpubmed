BACKGROUND
cortactin  was initially identified as one of the most prominent tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in v-src infected chicken embryo fibroblasts  <cit> . cortactin was independently isolated from mouse nih3t <dig> cells  <cit>  and human tumor cell lines  <cit> . human cortactin is encoded by the ems <dig> gene, which is located on chromosome 11q <dig>  <cit> . gene amplification of 11q <dig> region and concomitant overexpression of cortactin frequently occurs in several human carcinomas  <cit>  and correlates with lymph node metastasis and increased mortality  <cit> . elevated expression of cortactin increases cell motility, invasion  <cit>  and metastasis  <cit> .

the deduced amino acid sequence of cortactin revealed three main distinguishable domains: the n-terminal acidic domain containing a ddw-arp2/ <dig> binding motif followed by a six and one-half 37-amino acid f-actin binding repeat domain, a central region and an sh <dig> domain at the very c-terminal. the ddw-arp2/ <dig> binding site and the actin-binding domain together regulate f-actin polymerization and dynamics by activating the arp2/ <dig> complex  <cit>  and both are necessary for translocation of cortactin to sites of actin polymerization  <cit> . recently, we reported the identification of two alternative splice variants of human cortactin lacking either 6th or the 5th /6th repeat, present in normal tissues as well as squamous cell carcinomas cell lines  <cit> . these splice variants differ significantly in their ability to  bind f-actin,  cross-link f-actin  activate arp2/ <dig> mediated actin polymerization and  induce cell migration in vitro  <cit> . this indicates that also the number of repeats determines the affinity for f-actin and ability to regulate cell migration. similar cortactin splice variants were also reported in the mouse  <cit> , rat  <cit>  and frog  <cit> . the sh <dig> domain is a conserved protein module found in various signal proteins and mediates the interaction with various proteins such as n-wasp involved in actin polymerization, dynamin- <dig> in endocytosis, zo- <dig> in cell-cell interactions and shank- <dig> in neuronal growth cones . the central part of the protein between the f-actin repeat domain and the sh <dig> domain contains an alpha-helix sequence and a proline-rich region with three c-src tyrosine phosphorylation sites  <cit>  and three serine/threonine phosphorylation sites  <cit> . cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation occurs in response to growth factor treatment, integrin cross-linking, bacterial invasion and cell shrinkage . tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin reduces its f-actin cross-linking activity and is required for its ability to stimulate cell migration  <cit> . since cortactin operates mainly in cytoskeletal rearrangements, it may link other proteins via its sh <dig> domain to sites of actin polymerization. alternatively, serine phosphorylation of cortactin by erk enhances, whereas src phosphorylation inhibits the activation of n-wasp by cortactin  <cit>  and as a result affects actin polymerization. this suggests that cortactin at first instance may be directed to the site of actin polymerization by other proteins. thus, changes in protein expression level, phosphorylation state, the relative expression of splice variants and interactions with other proteins can all influence cell migration.

cortactin shows the highest similarity to the hematopoietic lineage cell-specific protein  <dig> . human hs <dig>  was originally isolated by its homology to the adenovirus e1a gene  <cit> . hs <dig> overall similarity to cortactin at the amino acid level is 51% but is highest at the sh <dig> domain  and the 37-amino-acids repeat domain , except that hs <dig> carries only three and one-half repeats. despite this high homology, the function of hs <dig> differs considerable from cortactin. first, hs <dig> is mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells  <cit> , whereas cortactin is widely expressed in all cell types except most hematopoietic cells  <cit> . only in platelets and in megakaryocytes both genes are expressed  <cit> . second, in concordance with this tissue distribution, hs <dig> is tyrosine phosphorylated after receptor cross-linking in b-cells  <cit> , t-cells  <cit> , mast cells  <cit>  and erythroid cells  <cit> , but at different residues compared to the functional phosphorylation residues in cortactin  <cit> . third, hs <dig> is, like cortactin, a cytoplasmic protein, but after tyrosine phosphorylation hs <dig> translocates to the nucleus  <cit> , whereas cortactin is never found in the nucleus. this is because hs <dig>  but not cortactin, contains a nuclear localization signal   <cit> . fourth, hs <dig> plays an important role in the receptor-mediated apoptosis and proliferative responses as demonstrated by the analysis of hs <dig> deficient mice  <cit>  and weh1- <dig> b lymphoma cells  <cit> . an hs <dig> tyrosine mutant that could not translocate to the nucleus, also failed to induce apoptosis  <cit> . consistent with its role in apoptosis, hs <dig> is able to bind to the mitochondrial protein hax- <dig>  a bcl <dig> like protein  <cit> . finally, the sh <dig> domain of hs <dig> at the c-terminus binds to other proteins  than those binding to cortactin, despite the very high amino acid sequence similarity of both sh <dig> domains . this most probably reflects the different tissue-specific expression pattern.

cortactin and hs <dig> share also remarkable similarities. first, hs <dig> binds with its ddw-motif directly to arp2/ <dig> and is involved in arp2/ <dig> mediated actin polymerization in vitro , although less efficient than cortactin  <cit> . second, hs <dig> binds to f-actin with its 37-amino-acid repeat domain  <cit> , however, it contains only three and one-half repeat in contrast to cortactin. third, also hs1-splice variants have been detected such as a variant lacking the 3rd repeat of the f-actin binding domain in a systemic lupus erythematosus  patient resulting in increased apoptosis after b-cell receptor  stimulation  <cit> . fourth, hs <dig> is sequentially phosphorylated on three tyrosine residues by various src family tyrosine kinases  <cit>  and two serine/threonine residues  <cit> , although at different residues than cortactin  <cit> . finally, both cortactin and hs <dig> can accumulate into podosomes, structures found in osteoclasts  <cit>  and marcrophages  <cit> , but also in rsv transformed cells  <cit>  and carcinoma cells  <cit> .

although cortactin and hs <dig> share a high amino acid sequence and structural similarity, their functions differ considerable. in this paper, we compare their genomic organization in order to provide more insight into their evolution, which may form the basis towards understanding specific functions of both genes. we describe the genomic organization and the exon-intron boundaries for human cortactin. both the genomic cdna and deduced amino acid sequences of human cortactin were compared to cortactin and hs <dig> genes from other species. genomic comparisons revealed the evolution and underscore the significance of the conserved f-actin binding repeat domain for hs <dig> and cortactin and the importance of alternative splicing for cortactin function.

RESULTS
the genomic organization of cortactin homologues
we have previously described the isolation and sequencing of the ems <dig> cdna  <cit>   coding for the human cortactin protein. to evaluate the genomic structure, we determined the exon/intron-boundaries. nucleotide sequence comparisons with human ems <dig> cdna sequence revealed homology with two human genomic clones  . the genomic structure of the ems1/cortactin gene was determined by performing blastn comparisons of ems <dig> cdna against the genomic clones . by amplifying the intron sequences  using primers on adjacent exons followed by end-sequencing of these products, we confirmed the intron/exon boundaries of the human ems1/cortactin gene. the ems <dig> gene contains  <dig> exons spanning over about  <dig> kb of genomic dna. the length of the individual exons ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, except the last exon . the splice donor and acceptor sequences, the sizes of the introns and exons of the human ems1/ cortactin gene are provided in the supplementary materials . the atg is at position  <dig>  at the first nucleotide of exon  <dig>  indicating that the first two exons encode the 5' untranslated region . the f-actin-binding repeat domain is encoded by exon  <dig> to exon  <dig> with  <dig> exons of  <dig> nucleotides in length  . the sequence encoding the ddw arp2/ <dig> binding site is located within exon  <dig> and the sh <dig> domain is encoded by exon  <dig> and  <dig>  the 3' utr is  <dig> nucleotides in length with a polyadenylation signal aataaa at position  <dig>

other cortactin homologues have been reported in mouse  <cit> , rat  <cit> , chicken  <cit> , fruit fly   <cit> , and frog   <cit> . we searched in numerous databases for all known cortactin genes in other species . the identification is based on overall amino acid sequence and overall structural homology with human cortactin. cortactin homologues exist in mammalians , birds , amphibians , fishes , urochordates , invertebrates , insects , shrimps, worms and sponges. to date, there is no evidence for the existence of cortactin in unicellular species, nor in plants. thus, cortactin seems to be restricted to metazoans.

for several species, both cdna and genomic sequences  are available and therefore we were able to reveal their genomic organization using blastn. the exon/intron-boundaries were determined and compared to human cortactin . as schematically presented in figure  <dig>  the genomic organization and the lengths of the exons as well as the locations of the exon/intron boundaries are highly conserved from urochordates to mammalians. pufferfishes have the shortest known genome of all vertebrate species due to much shorter introns, nevertheless most exon/intron boundaries were conserved and similar to mammalian cortactin. intriguingly, the number of repeats in the actin-binding domain differs between species . the number of exons and the location of the intron/exon borders of insect cortactin  differ considerably with mammalian cortactin, despite the proteins sequences are very similar. drosophila and mosquito carry  <dig> repeats in the actin-binding domain. in both species, repeat 1-to- <dig> and  <dig> are on separate exons with in mosquito the 4th repeat of the actin binding domain to be encoded by a single  <dig> bp large exon  <dig> . both, sponge  and sea squirt  cortactin protein carry  <dig> repeats. during evolution, after creation of sponges and worms, the coelomata divided into insects and urochordates . the genomic organization of ancestors of the coelomata should reveal the roots of cortactin evolution. however, complete cdna and/or genomic dna of cortactin homologues in these species are not yet available.

the genomic organization hs <dig> homologues
both nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons with cortactin revealed the highest similarity with the hematopoietic lineage cell-specific protein  <dig> . so far, hs <dig> homologues have been reported in human  <cit> , mouse  <cit> , rat and chimpanzee , suggesting that hs <dig> exists in mammalians only. we determined the intron/exon boundaries of mammalian hs <dig> genes by aligning the cdna with the genomic dna using blastn . the number and lengths of the exons and the locations of the exon/intron boundaries were very similar to cortactin, especially in the exons that encode the actin-binding domain . the exons 10– <dig> of hs <dig> encoding the centre region between the actin-binding domain and the sh <dig> domain are longer  and more divergent compared to corresponding exons of cortactin.

in addition to a single cortactin homologue in all other species, nucleotide sequences comparisons using the mammalian hs <dig> mrna and genomic dna sequences revealed  genomic sequences in chicken, pufferfish, zebrafish and frog  that were more related to the hs <dig> protein . because no hs <dig> homologues for these species were present in the mrna/dbest database , the cdna  sequences were deduced from the genomic dna with blastn or were predicted by ensemble program. in these lower species, two cortactin related proteins exist. to distinguish between cortactin and hs <dig> variants, only the most conserved n-terminal part of cortactin and hs <dig> protein variants, including repeat  <dig>  was used in blastp analysis. in each species, one protein variant turned out to be more homologous to human cortactin, and was called cortactin, whereas the other protein variant appeared to be more related to hs <dig> and was called hs <dig>  this analysis unveiled hs <dig> proteins with more than  <dig> repeats in chicken and pufferfish tetraodon nigroviridis , pufferfish takifugi rubripes and xenopus laevis hs <dig>  and zebrafish hs <dig>  .

moreover, alignments of the exon/intron boundaries of these hs <dig> genes to the mammalian hs <dig> genes  revealed that exon  <dig>  of hs <dig> was most similar to exon  <dig>  of cortactin suggesting that in mammalians exon  <dig> and  <dig>  of hs <dig> were lost during evolution. this is supported by the presence of at least one sequence of  <dig> nucleotides in the  <dig> bp intron  <dig> of human hs <dig>  that is predicted by the program hmmer when performing alignments using a consensus sequence of the  <dig> amino acid repeats. however, this sequence is not functional because it does not represent an exon based on the consensus sequence of exon-intron junctions  and no human transcripts or ests of hs <dig> including this sequence are present in the ncbi databases. in summary, hs <dig> is not restricted to mammalians only, but exist also in fishes, amphibians and birds and its genomic structure is very similar to that of cortactin.

different promoter regions explain distinct tissue specificity of cortactin and hs1
cortactin is widely expressed in most cell types suggesting to be important for vital functions, while hs <dig> expression is restricted to hematopoietic cells suggesting to be tailored later in evolution to serve a specific function in these cells. in concordance with their tissue-specific expression pattern, we suppose that their expression might be differently regulated. therefore, we compared the upstream promoter regions of several cortactin and hs <dig> genes . the mammalian cortactin gene is very gc rich and contains putative sp- <dig> transcriptional factor binding sites that are common to many tata-less promoters and typical for promoter regions in 'widely-expressed housekeeping genes'. ets family transcription factors, found in the hs <dig> promoters, are specific for hematopoietic cells and involved in controlling the expression of many b cell- and macrophage-specific genes  <cit>  and are critical for development of lymphoid and myeloid cell lineages. the promoter region of drosophila and mosquito cortactin shares putative transcription factors found both in mammalian cortactin and hs <dig>  thus at least in mammalians, the nature of the promoters seemed to determine the broad distribution of cortactin expression in various tissues except most hematopoietic cells and the limited expression of hs <dig> to hematopoetic cells.

the significance of the actin binding repeat domain in cortactin and hs1
we recently reported the identification of two alternative splice variants of human cortactin; sv1-cortactin lacking the 6th repeat and sv <dig> lacking the 5th and 6th repeat resulting in a different f-actin binding properties and decreased cell migration  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  cortactin splice variants exist in other mammalians as well as in chicken and frog. so far, splice variants in other species have not been identified, suggesting that alternative splicing of cortactin seems to be restricted to higher metazoans. all intron sequences of cortactin bordering the splice site junctions follow the general gt/ag rule  <cit>  except for intron  <dig>  . as has been shown for other genes, a gt-to-gc transition might be responsible for the generation of an alternatively mrna transcript  <cit> . however, in frog , the sv1-cortactin variant exists despite the splice donor of intron  <dig> begins with a gt  <cit> . thus, concerning the genome of these different species, alternative splicing of the actin-binding domain of cortactin seems to be facilitated during evolution by modulating the splicing machinery by a gt-to-gc transition to create cortactin related variants that influences cellular properties  <cit> . the relative expression of cortactin splice variants by tissue origin  <cit>  suggested that splice variants might have tissue-specific functions such as fine-tuning the organization of the f-actin cytoskeleton and consequently regulating cell adhesion and migration.

alternative splicing also occurs in human hs <dig>  recently a splice variant lacking the 3rd repeat  has been found in an sle patient  <cit> , resulting in enhanced bcr-mediated cell death. this alternative splicing event was due to a germ line mutation. in contrast, the splice donor of hs <dig> intron  <dig> begins with a gc . with respect to the similarities between cortactin and hs <dig>  it might be of interest to investigate the occurrence of splicing of hs <dig> exon  <dig> and possible biological consequences. the 3rd repeat and its nls links hs <dig> to a role in apoptosis, while such a role has not been described for cortactin lacking a nls. since the cytoskeleton architecture in hematopoietic lineage cells is very different from that in adherent cells, it is likely that hs <dig> plays an important role in the construction of tissue-type specific actin networks. other types of actin cytoskeleton factors, such as the arp2/ <dig> complex activators of the wasp family have been reported to have distinct tissue specific expression profiles as well. thus, the apparent role of hs <dig> in apoptosis is likely due to its actin remodeling related function. additionally, our genomic comparisons revealed that the 3rd repeat of hs <dig> corresponds with the 5th repeat of cortactin, and therefore it might be of interest to investigate whether cortactin sv <dig> variant  might be involved in apoptosis.

the 4th repeat of cortactin has been suggested to be required for f-actin-binding  <cit> . genomic comparisons revealed that hs <dig> lacks this 4th repeat. nonetheless, hs <dig> does bind to f-actin and activate the arp2/ <dig> complex, although at a lower efficiency than cortactin  <cit> . this suggests that not only a single repeat but the number of repeats is crucial for the f-actin-binding affinity  <cit> . in addition, hs <dig> contains a pip <dig> binding site in each of its  <dig> repeats, whereas cortactin has only one in the 4th repeat. pip <dig> reduces f-actin cross-linking by cortactin, probably due to competition for the same binding site. due to its higher affinity for pip <dig>  <cit> , hs <dig> restores this cortactin/f-actin cross-linking process by trapping pip <dig>  this might be of importance in platelets and megakaryocytes where both, cortactin and hs <dig> are expressed. taken together, the composition of the repeat domain is also involved in diverting the functions of both genes.

an elegant way to study the function of a protein is to perform loss-of-function experiments. so far, cortactin knock-out models have not yet been generated successfully, because deletion of one allele of cortactin leads to premature differentiation of embryonic stem cells . however, complete loss-of-function mutants of the drosophila cortactin gene were viable and fertile, except impaired border cell migration during oogenesis  <cit> . down-regulation of cortactin by rna interference, revealed an essential role for cortactin in dendritic spine morphogenesis  <cit>  and in e-cadherin mediated contact formation in epithelial cells  <cit> . mice lacking hs <dig>  showed normal development of the lymphoid system  <cit> , however, the antigen-receptor induced clonal expansion and deletion of b and t lymphocytes were impaired. thus, loss of function studies underscores the divergent functions of hs <dig> and cortactin in different cell systems.

cortactin and hs <dig> are derived from an ancestral vertebrate cortactin-gene by gene duplication
to examine the genesis of the cortactin family, we studied the relationship between the cortactin and hs <dig> homologues by generating a phylogenetic tree based on a multi-sequence alignment with the clustalw  <dig>  program . we compared the n-terminal regions including repeat  <dig> , because this is the best-conserved region among all homologues . one cluster contains all known hs <dig> proteins and appeared to be closest related to a cluster composed by insects , drosophila ), urochordate ) and sponge  cortactin. in this last cluster all the species with only one gene  are present. this suggests that with the appearance of the vertebrates, an ancestral gene became duplicated to create two genes, which later evolved into cortactin and hs <dig>  this hypothesis is supported by the fact that many genes duplicated at this stage in the evolution, the overall amino-acid sequence in both genes is very similar and the introns are located at the same amino acid position. furthermore, gene duplication often correlates with a tissue specific expression pattern of the duplicated genes, which is true for mammalian cortactin and hs <dig> 

the genome of pufferfish takifugu rubripes contains two cortactin-related genomic sequences both including  <dig> 1/ <dig> repeats. most likely, an ancestor vertebrate cortactin gene underwent gene duplication. from this moment on during evolution, two cortactin/hs1-releated genes are present in all higher species. one gene evolved to mammalian hs <dig> with a specific function in apoptosis in hematopoietic cells. for its function, exon  <dig> and  <dig>  were not useful and lost during evolution. however, the hs <dig> protein in pufferfish takifugu rubripes and frog xenopus laevis contains  <dig> 1/ <dig> repeats, while chicken and pufferfish tetraodon nigroviridis hs <dig> carries  <dig> 1/ <dig> repeats. it might be of interest to investigate the function of these hs <dig> proteins and their functional differences to mammalian hs <dig>  the other gene evolved to a ubiquitously expressed mammalian cortactin protein with a vital function in the organization of the cytoskeleton and cell migration. the 6th repeat of cortactin most likely originated from a duplication event of the 5th repeat, since the 6th repeat is most similar to the 5th repeat in all species with  <dig> 1/ <dig> repeats. we recently demonstrated that  <dig> 1/ <dig> repeats are necessary for optimal f-actin cross-linking activity and cell migration, while the splice variant lacking both the 5th and 6th repeats  was less efficient  <cit> . thus, the number of repeats in the f-actin binding domain of cortactin fine-tunes its function in cytoskeletal remodeling. for that reason, in higher metazoans, alternative splicing of the f-actin binding domain is most likely facilitated by a gt-gc transition in the splice donor. alternatively, we can not exclude that gene duplication might have taken place after duplicated of the 5th repeat , since both zebrafish cortactin and hs <dig> contain  <dig> 1/ <dig> repeats.

CONCLUSIONS
we report the genomic organization of cortactin and hs <dig> genes of several species. these genes display a conserved genomic organization as the coding regions have almost identical exon/intron structure. comparison of 5' sequences allows possible regulatory elements that stress their specific tissue distribution. comparative analysis of the genomic organization and amino acid sequences of cortactin and hs <dig> provides insight into the evolution of the conserved actin-binding repeat domain, which forms the basis towards understanding specific functions of both genes. most likely, both genes originated from a gene duplication event and subsequently hs <dig> lost two repeats, whereas cortactin gained one repeat. our analysis genetically underscores the significance of the f-actin binding domain in cytoskeletal remodeling, which is of importance for the major role of hs <dig> in apoptosis and for cortactin in cell migration.
