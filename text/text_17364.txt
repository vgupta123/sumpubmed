BACKGROUND
the stanniocalcin  family of secreted glycoproteins consists of two members - stc <dig> and stc <dig> - that have 35% conserved identity and conservation of exon/intron boundaries, indicating that they are paralogs  <cit> . stc was first discovered in fish and shown to be involved in calcium homeostasis through effects on calcium influx  <cit> . although terrestrial mammals rarely experience hypercalcemia, alterations in subcellular compartmentalization of ca2+ are found under pathological conditions such as the accumulation of improperly folded proteins. stc <dig> expression is upregulated upon induction of hypoxic or endoplasmic reticulum  stress in n2a neuroblastoma cells  <cit> . this increase in stc <dig> expression was reliant on the concomitant increase of activating transcription factor   <cit> , a protein integral to -like endoplasmic reticulum kinase  signalling, which is part of the unfolded protein response . to date, no relationship between perk signalling and stc <dig> activation has been identified in vivo.

the upr is activated when er homeostasis is disrupted. alterations to proper functioning of er machinery arise when protein load exceeds folding capacity, such as when luminal er ca2+ concentrations are perturbed. the upr consists of three signalling pathways that are individually transduced by atf <dig>  inositol-requiring enzyme  <dig>  or perk  <cit> . each transducer is maintained in a repressed state by binding of the er chaperone protein glucose regulated protein  <dig>   <cit> . when unfolded proteins accumulate, they bind to grp78/bip resulting in its release from the upr transducers  <cit> . in the case of perk, dissociation of grp78/bip leads to its homodimerization and autoactivation  <cit> . activation of perk results in phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α   <cit> , limiting its ability to contribute to the protein translational complex, thereby inhibiting global protein translation and alleviating the protein load on the cell  <cit> . phosphorylation of eif2α also selectively upregulates translation of mrnas from short upstream open reading frames  <cit> . the predominant target mrna for peif2α is atf <dig>  which subsequently increases the expression of the transcriptional repressor atf <dig>  and growth arrest and dna damage-inducible   <dig>  <cit> . gadd <dig>  negatively regulates perk signalling by combining with protein phosphatase  <dig> to dephosphorylate eif2α, thereby restoring general translation  <cit> .

perk is expressed in the exocrine and endocrine pancreas under normal conditions  <cit>  and perk-/- mice experience deterioration of glycemic control and exocrine insufficiency over time  <cit> . exocrine specific deletion of perk revealed cellular disorganization and degranulation, increased serum amylase levels and increased cell death  <cit> . our laboratory identified rapid activation of perk signalling following induction of pancreatitis by supramaximal secretagogue stimulation and correlated decreased activation of the pathway in mice that exhibit increased sensitivity to pancreatic injury  <cit> . together, these observations indicate that perk signalling has important roles in both the physiology and pathology of the exocrine pancreas.

given the relationship between perk and stc <dig> in vitro, the objectives of this study were to  determine if a similar relationship exists in the exocrine pancreas and  gain insight into a role for stc <dig> as part of the upr. our results revealed a correlation of stc <dig> expression with perk signalling in vivo only after initiating pancreatic injury. transgenic over-expression of stc <dig> in mice   <cit>  resulted in altered perk signalling and decreased signs of acinar cell damage associated with cerulein-induced pancreatitis . these observations suggest that stc <dig> is linked to perk signalling in acinar cells and may have a role in limiting damage during pancreatic injury.

RESULTS
to determine if perk signalling is active in pancreatic tissue, we performed if with an antibody that recognizes only the phosphorylated form of perk . the accumulation of pperk was restricted to a tight apical portion of the acinar cells  typical of where ca2+ is released during the process of regulated exocytosis. rt-pcr revealed no expression of stc <dig> in control pancreata . similar results were obtained in control pancreata for atf <dig>  another downstream target of perk signalling suggesting that perk activation under resting conditions does not activate all downstream mediators of perk signalling. our laboratory has shown that activation of perk signalling increases during pancreatic injury  <cit> . to determine if the pathological activation of perk leads to increased stc <dig> expression, pancreatic injury was initiated by cerulein-induced pancreatitis . interestingly, cip treatment led to a change in pperk localization within four hours, with active perk exhibiting a more diffuse and basally-restricted pattern of accumulation , similar to the changes observed for acinar cell exocytosis under these conditions  <cit> . this change in localization was accompanied by increased stc <dig> and atf <dig> mrna accumulation . increased stc <dig> expression was confirmed by northern blot analysis four hours after induction of pancreatitis . while we were unable to detect stc <dig> protein by if analysis , increased accumulation of atf <dig> protein was restricted to acinar cells in cip-treated pancreatic tissue . to support the link between elevated stc <dig> levels and injury-associated perk activation, we examined the expression of stc <dig> in mist1-/- mice, which exhibit minimal activation of perk during injury. mist <dig> is a transcription factor required for terminal differentiation of pancreatic acinar cells, and its absence in exocrine tissue results in improper activation of upr components both normally and during injury  <cit> . in sharp contrast to wild type mice, stc <dig> mrna was virtually undetectable upon cip treatment of mist1-/- mice .

these findings suggest that stc <dig> is co-induced with perk in acinar cells only after injury and may protect the pancreas in response to cip. to determine if stc <dig> could alter the acinar cell response to pancreatic injury, we examined a mouse model in which stc <dig> is constitutively expressed . ihc confirmed increased accumulation of stc <dig> in stc2tg pancreata compared to wild type  tissue, with stc <dig> accumulation in islets and exocrine tissue . h&e histology  indicated that morphology was not overtly altered in stc2tg pancreatic tissue. if staining for pancreatic differentiation markers mist <dig>  and pdx <dig>  showed similar spatial localization and glut- <dig> accumulation was localized to the cell membrane of endocrine cells in both genotypes . western blot analysis confirmed equivalent levels of these markers, as well as amylase, between wt and stc2tg tissue .

we next examined perk signalling in stc2tg pancreatic tissue. perk activation results in phosphorylation of eif2α and translation of atf <dig>  <cit> . atf <dig> is required for expression of gadd <dig>  atf <dig> and stc <dig>  <cit> . western blot analysis of wt and stc2tg pancreatic tissue revealed decreased phosphorylation of both perk and eif2α  in stc2tg tissue. surprisingly, atf <dig> accumulated to higher levels in the stc2tg pancreas, suggesting dysregulation of perk signalling. we next examined xbp <dig>  another mediator of the upr that is outside of the perk signalling pathway. xbp <dig> mrna is targeted by the endonuclease activity of ire <dig> leading to production of an active, spliced  form of xbp <dig>  <cit> . western blot analysis revealed a consistent decreased in sxbp <dig> accumulation in stc2tg mice indicating that elevated stc <dig> levels may also affect the other upr pathways.

to understand why activation of perk and eif2α appear reduced in stc2tg tissue, we examined regulators of these two proteins. the phosphorylation of eif2α is reversed by gadd <dig> through its interaction with protein phosphatase  <dig>  and recent evidence indicates that calcineurin binds perk and stimulates its autophosphorylation  <cit> . in stc2tg pancreatic tissue, the levels of gadd <dig> protein were significantly higher than wild type tissue . conversely, stc2tg calcineurin levels were considerably lower than wt counterparts. no changes in the er resident protein calregulin were observed between genotypes . based on these results, it appears that over-expression of stc <dig> affected expression of mediators and feedback mechanisms in perk signalling.

alterations to perk/atf <dig> signalling should have an effect on cell autophagy, a long-term response to er stress, which is regulated by atf <dig> during hypoxia  <cit> . western blot analysis followed by densitometry revealed a significant increase in the cleaved form of the autophagy marker myosin associated protein  <dig> light chain  <dig>  in stc2tg pancreatic tissue  consistent with increased accumulation of atf <dig> in stc2tg mice. if analysis corroborated increased autophagy as punctate lc <dig> staining is notably increased in stc2tg exocrine tissue  when compared to wt tissue .

the alterations in perk signalling and cell autophagy suggested that stc2tg mice should have altered sensitivity to pancreatic injury. four hours after the induction of pancreatitis, we compared circulating serum amylase levels and tissue edema between wt and stc2tg mice . while serum amylase levels were moderately higher in saline-treated stc2tg mice, the proportional increase in serum amylase levels following cip was significantly lower in stc2tg mice when compared to wt mice, indicative of decreased sensitivity to pancreatic insult . however, no difference was observed in tissue edema after cip between genotypes . we next examined the effects of pancreatic injury at the cellular level by examining enzyme activation and cell structures. western blot analysis of procarboxypeptidase  activation revealed reduced levels of active cpa in cip stc2tg pancreatic tissue when compared to wt cerulein-treated tissue . interestingly, analysis of cell junction proteins showed continued expression in stc2tg tissue following cip that was not evident in wt tissue. in wt acinar cells, the expression of β-catenin decreased to negligible levels, indicative of a loss in adherens junctions between acinar cells as expected . however, β-catenin remained readily detectable in stc2tg pancreatic tissue after induction of cip . similarly, punctate connexin <dig>  accumulation was lost in wt  but not in stc2tg acini  suggesting a greater disruption in gap junction complexes in wt acinar cells. western blot analysis corroborated if data with cip leading to a more dramatic loss of β-catenin and cx <dig> accumulation in wt extracts compared to stc2tg extracts after four hours  indicating that intercellular complexes were protected in stc2tg mice, suggestive of reduced cellular damage. combined, these findings suggest that acinar cell integrity is maintained to a higher degree when acini are exposed to higher than normal levels of stc <dig> 

as a final marker for cip severity, we assessed the amount of acinar cell necrosis and apoptosis within the two genotypes. the ratio of necrosis to apoptosis correlates to cip severity  <cit> . visualization of apoptosis using tunel staining revealed increased apoptosis in both wt  and stc2tg  pancreatic tissue after induction of pancreatitis. quantification of tunel positive cells revealed slight decreases in acinar cell apoptosis in stc2tg tissue . we next examined necrosis through if for high mobility group protein b <dig> , a protein that interacts with dna, but upon necrotic stimulus, is released from the nucleus and the cell to participate in inflammatory responses  <cit> . cytoplasmic staining of hmgb <dig> is routinely used as an indicator of cell necrosis. hmgb <dig> is localized to the nucleus in both wt  and stc2tg  saline treated tissue. after induction of pancreatitis, punctate, cytoplasmic hmbg <dig> staining was observed in distinct patches of cells only in wt tissue . all stc2tg tissue analysed was devoid of punctate cytoplasmic hmgb <dig> staining . this analysis reveals that the levels of both apoptosis and necrosis are decreased in stc2tg tissue, indicative of less tissue damage after cip.

discussion
stc <dig> is a secreted protein that, when expressed to high levels in mice, has profound effects leading to growth restriction  <cit> . however, ablation of stc <dig> in mice results in limited phenotypic alterations suggesting that stc <dig> functions may fall outside normal physiology  <cit> . in support of such a hypothesis, in vitro analysis has identified increased stc <dig> accumulation following treatment with thapsigargin or tunicamycin, agents that activate er stress pathways  <cit> . stc <dig> is also up-regulated in response to hypoxic insult and is expressed to higher levels in many tumor-derived cell lines  <cit> . this suggests that stc <dig> may be involved in responding to external challenges that activate cell stress pathways. in this study, we have identified increased stc <dig> accumulation within four hours of inducing pancreatic injury that correlated with activation of the perk signalling. importantly, forced expression of stc <dig> in mice altered perk signalling and reduced cellular damage in response to pancreatic injury. these results suggest a role for stc <dig> responding to and mediating the effects of cell stress in pancreatic tissue.

studies assessing the expression of stc <dig> have revealed a limited expression pattern in adult tissues. in the human pancreas, stc <dig> is specifically expressed in alpha cells of the islets of langerhans and not in acinar tissue  <cit> . our mrna analysis revealed murine pancreatic expression of stc <dig> only after induction of pancreatitis by supramaximal secretagogue stimulation. unfortunately, ihc on cip-treated tissue sections did not detect stc <dig> protein  indicating that stc <dig> may be expressed at lower than detectable levels or that it is rapidly secreted into the circulation. while we have not definitively identified acini as the origin of stc <dig> expression, atf <dig>  a downstream mediator of perk signalling, accumulated only in acinar cells during cip, suggesting that cip treatment leads to a cell autonomous activation of stc <dig>  as observed in hek <dig> and n2a neuroblastoma cells, the increased accumulation of stc <dig> is consistent with activation of perk signalling in response to injury  <cit> . induction of stc <dig> mrna levels was not observed after cip in mist1-/- mice, which do not activate perk or atf <dig>  and experience increased severity of cip  <cit> . these findings support the activation of stc <dig> as a protective mechanism, potentially as a mediator of the upr.

while previous studies have correlated increased expression of stc <dig> as part of the upr, the effects of stc <dig> on perk signalling have not been examined. we have now shown that systemically high levels of stc <dig> reduce perk activation. stc2tg mice showed decreased phosphorylation of perk and eif2α in pancreatic tissue suggesting that continued exposure to stc <dig> may lead to activation of negative feedback mechanisms. since no change in total eif2α is observed, this difference is peif2α is specific to the phosphorylation event and not decreased eif2α accumulation. while we showed a decrease in pperk, total perk levels were not assessed and this could account for possible differences in activation of the pathways as well.

we have identified at least two effectors of the perk signalling pathway that were changed in stc2tg mice. first, gadd <dig>  which combines with protein phosphatase  <dig> to reduce eif2α phosphorylation  <cit> , accumulated to higher levels. second, we observed significantly decreased accumulation of calcineurin, which stimulates perk autophosphorylation, thereby increasing activity  <cit> . whether these changes are reflective of a direct role for stc <dig> in their regulation or a response to other events caused by over exposure to stc <dig> is unclear. however, the altered expression of these factors suggests a role for stc <dig> in regulating ca2+ homeostasis since both calcineurin and perk are affected by altered ca2+ sequestration in the er. these data suggest that constitutive exposure to stc <dig> results in depression of the activity of key factors regulating the upr.

in light of decreased perk and eif2α activation, it was surprising that increased accumulation of atf <dig> was observed in the pancreas of stc2tg mice. phosphorylation of eif2α is known to stimulate translation of atf <dig> mrna, leading to increased atf <dig> protein accumulation. however, increased atf <dig> expression, and the subsequent increase in gadd <dig> could be mediated by increased stability of the atf <dig> protein. recent studies have shown that atf <dig> is stabilized by interaction with p <dig> through inhibition of ubiquitination  <cit> , and that association with p300/cbp enhances atf <dig> transcriptional ability  <cit> . it is possible that in stc2tg mice, stabilization of atf <dig> is enhanced regardless of decreased phosphorylation of eif2α, accounting for its increased expression. although there is little known about non-peif2α related transcriptional activation of atf <dig>  increased transcriptional activation by a yet to be identified factor cannot be ruled out.

as would be expected from increased atf <dig> expression, stc2tg mice also exhibited an increased level of autophagy, a downstream consequence of elevated atf <dig> levels. autophagy is important for maintenance of cellular homeostasis through balancing synthesis and degradation or recycling of cellular components. independent studies have indicated that either phosphorylation of eif2α or expression of atf <dig> is required for induction of autophagy in vitro  <cit> . the increased expression of atf <dig> in stc2tg pancreatic tissue may be the cause of increased autophagy. interestingly, we did not observe increased acinar cell apoptosis , which is another downstream result of increased upr. therefore, it appears that only certain parts of the upr have been activated in stc2tg mice.

whether stc <dig> is protective in nature is still unclear since studies have shown it has both protective  <cit>  and detrimental roles  <cit>  in cancer progression in vitro. our results suggest a protective advantage following exocrine pancreatic injury in vivo. stc2tg mice exhibit a decreased proportional increase in serum amylase levels, increased maintenance of cellular junctions, decreased apoptosis and necrosis and decreased activation of cpa in exocrine pancreatic tissue, all suggestive of decreased pancreatitis severity. in addition, the enhanced autophagy observed in stc2tg acinar tissue would facilitate more rapid degradation of resident digestive enzymes upon injury, thereby limiting damage to cellular contents. this would account for increased maintenance of cellular junctions. however, to truly understand the role of stc <dig> in pancreatic injury, further experiments in mice lacking stc <dig> mice should be performed.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this is the first study to correlate perk signalling and stc <dig> in vivo, and suggests two novel roles for stc <dig>  as a downstream effector of perk signalling and possible protective factor during pancreatic injury. this is also the first time that stc <dig> has been shown to affect proteins that regulate ca2+-mediated response in the cell.
