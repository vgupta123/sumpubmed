BACKGROUND
the nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase  enzymes are classified as pyrophosphatases or phosphodiesterases depending on the type of substrates they hydrolyze. npp1- <dig> are pyrophosphatases that cleave inorganic phosphates from nucleotides and their derivatives  <cit> . in contrast, npp <dig>  npp <dig> and npp <dig> are phosphodiesterases that hydrolyze phosphodiester bonds in lipids and their derivatives  <cit> . npp <dig> and npp <dig> are yet to be characterized in terms of substrates and types of activity. npp <dig> is the only one of the seven mammalian npp family members that is known to possess both pyrophosphatase and phosphodiesterase activities  <cit> . npp <dig> is also the only mammalian family member to have been characterized by x-ray crystallography  <cit> . as a phosphodiesterase it exhibits a lysophospholipase d  activity, in contrast to npp <dig> and npp <dig> which exhibit lysophospholipase c  activity. besides these specific activities, npp family members also exhibit distinct substrate preference profiles but no clear structural basis for the preferences has been proposed  <cit> . npp family members are of considerable interest due to their role in biological functions ranging from bone mineralization to cancer  <cit> . npp <dig> specifically has been linked with anti-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic activities through its influence on the conversion of sm to ceramide  <cit> , however homozygous knockout of npp <dig> in mice did not lead to spontaneous tumorigenesis although lipid digestion and absorption was altered  <cit> . mutagenic deletion of a segment from npp <dig> including h <dig>  a residue involved in chelating one of the essential divalent metal cations, has been identified in the rapidly proliferating colon cancer ht- <dig> cell line  <cit> .

npp <dig> hydrolyzes lysophosphatidylcholine , platelet activating factor  and sphingomyelin  with a lysophospholipase c activity but exhibits a preference for sm over lpc and paf  <cit> . several studies have examined the roles of specific amino acids in the hydrolysis of sm. three of the conserved metal-chelating residues from the npp family  have been mutated to alanine in npp <dig>  and each mutant was devoid of sphingomyelinase activity. the conserved catalytic threonine residue, t <dig>  has also been mutated to alanine with the expected loss of sphingomyelinase activity  <cit> . additional amino acids near the catalytic residue have been mutated in attempts to change substrate specificity to include nucleotide pyrophosphates, including m74k, s76f, and c78n  <cit> . these mutations all eliminated sphingomyelinase activity without producing pyrophosphatase activity. it is unclear whether the mutated proteins were properly folded, although expression levels were comparable to wild type. more recently, mutations based on a comparative model of npp <dig> were performed  <cit> . in contrast to the result obtained upon mutation of m <dig> to k, mutation of m <dig> to l enhanced sphingomyelinase activity, again without gain of pyrophosphatase activity. the model displayed close interaction between f <dig> and the choline methyl groups, best described as a cation-π interaction. mutation of f <dig> to glycine nearly eliminated sphingomyelinase activity. the model displayed no close interaction between f <dig> and substrates, however, the f141s mutation showed activity nearly as poor as the f275g mutant, indicating either incorrect selection of the conformation of the loop involving residues 140- <dig>  or incorrect substrate positioning. therefore the interactions between npp <dig> and sm are partially defined, and modeled interactions with other substrates have not been supported by experimental results. further efforts are clearly needed to develop a complete and coherent picture of substrate recognition and discrimination by npp <dig> 

lyso-platelet activating factor , sphingosylphosphorylcholine , and para-nitrophenyphosphorylcholine  are high affinity substrates for npp <dig> . here we examine the amino acid residues within the npp <dig> active site that may be involved in substrate recognition by npp <dig>  we employed homology modeling to predict protein-substrate interaction points followed by experimental validation of the predictions by mutagenesis and biochemical assays. we used the bacterial xac npp crystal structure  <cit>  as well as two recently reported npp <dig> crystal structures  <cit>  to generate homology models of npp <dig> for this work. our modeling results reveal a common choline headgroup binding pocket for all substrates. the strong interactions between the cationic choline and the π electrons of the aromatic sidechain of f <dig> were easily identified by standard docking algorithms. experimental mutagenesis results are consistent with the predicted choline headgroup positions for all substrates. the hydrophobic tails proved more challenging to place in the complex. docking algorithms typically cannot exhaustively search the conformations and positions of long and flexible molecules lacking any polar groups that would be involved in directional interactions such as hydrogen bonding. manual placement was used, and refinements of hydrophobic tail positions by molecular dynamics were required in order to correlate the substrate complex models with the experimental mutagenesis results in the hydrophobic tail region. the molecular dynamics simulations were important to demonstrate the high mobility of the hydrophobic tail positions, as well as to refine the initial complex of sphingomyelin  to explain the different pattern of experimental mutation impacts on activity for this substrate, relative to the other three examined.

methods
molecular modeling
molecular modeling and simulation was done using the molecular operating environment  software package  <cit> . three homology models of npp <dig> were built in moe by aligning the human protein sequence  <cit>   with either the bacterial xac crystal structure from the protein data bank , the rat npp <dig> crystal structure  or the mouse npp <dig> crystal structure . the homology models were energy minimized using the mmff94x force field, a derivative of the mmff <dig>  <cit>  force field with improved treatment of planar nitrogens. minimizations were terminated when the energy gradient reached a root mean square  value of  <dig> kcal/mol·Å in order to prevent collapse of binding pockets to enhance hydrophobic interactions in the absence of ligand.

substrate docking with the moe software was used to study interactions between npp <dig> and its previously known substrates and their closely related analogs. docking used placements of ligand atom triangles into protein site alpha sphere triangles with subsequent focefield refinement using mmff94x  <cit> . one hundred initial placements were used in each docking run. pnppc was directly docked into the active site as a whole molecule since it is small and has limited flexibility. the phospholipid substrates; lpc, paf, and sm, are highly flexible because of long hydrocarbon chains in their structures. for this reason stepwise docking was done starting with the polar head groups of each substrate. wall restraints were used to keep the substrate phosphate within  <dig> Å of the enzyme's active residue, threonine  <dig>  the hydrophobic chains were then extended three carbon atoms at a time followed by energy minimization for the newly added atoms at each step. the protein surface feature within moe was used to visualize the various channels that could accommodate the substrate hydrophobic tails during binding. bond rotations were done on the extended chains followed by energy minimization to explore the best positions for each chain and thus the minimum energy conformation for each substrate. the lowest energy conformation was then selected for each substrate.

molecular dynamics was performed on selected npp <dig> substrate complexes using the moe software. simulations were performed using the mmff94x forcefield with the generalized born implicit solvation model  <cit> . the nvt ensemble was used with constraints on bonds to hydrogens. atomic positions were recalculated at  <dig> fs timesteps using the nosé-poincairé-andersen equations of motion  <cit> . a heating phase of  <dig> ps was used to raise the simulation temperature from  <dig> k to  <dig> k. the production phase began at the end of the heating phase and continued to the  <dig> ps timepoint. snapshots were saved every  <dig> ps during both phases of the simulation for analysis.

npp <dig> plasmid design
a mammalian expression vector pcdna4/to/myc his b containing the full-length human npp <dig> sequence was a generous gift from dr. rui-dong duan . a flag-tag and a stop codon were incorporated at position  <dig> using the sense primer 5'-ccc atg ctg cac aca gac tac aag gac gac gat gac aagtaggaatctgctcttccg-3' and antisense primer 5'-cggaag agcagattcctacttgtcatcgtcgtccttgtagtctgtgtgcagcatggg-3'. this generated npp7ex-flag which had previously been demonstrated  <cit>  to retain catalytic activity and localize in the cell culture medium. mutagenesis was done by pcr using the quickchange® site directed mutagenesis kit from qiagen-usa. this customized gene was further sub cloned into the mammalian vector, pcdna <dig>   at the noti and bamhi restriction sites. all mutants were generated from this customized plasmid using qiagen's multi site-directed mutagenesis protocol using only the sense primer. all sense primers used in generating our various mutations are shown in table  <dig>  all pcr products were amplified in nova blue e. coli cells and purified according to the manufacturer's protocols .

npp7ex-flag expression
human embryonic kidney cells  were seeded in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium  containing 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum and  <dig> mm l-glutamine. the cells were grown overnight at 37°c and 5% co <dig> up to a 80% confluence before transfection with purified hnpp7ex-flag insert subcloned in the pcdna <dig>  mammalian vector. transfection was done in the presence of polyfect transfection reagent from qiagen according to the manufacturer's protocol. five to eight hours after trasfection, the culture medium was changed to serum free dmem and cells incubated for  <dig> hours at 37°c and 5% co <dig>  conditioned media containing secreted hnpp7ex-flag protein was collected and concentrated using  <dig>  molecular weight cutoff  filters  by centrifugation at  <dig> × g for  <dig> minutes. concentrated npp <dig> protein was stored at 4°c in npp <dig> assay buffer, ph  <dig> without addition of adjuvants.

western blots
western blots with the m <dig> anti-flag antibody  were used to verify expression of hnpp7ex-flag and its mutants by hek293t cells. following tris-hcl-sds-page  proteins were transferred onto poly-m-vinylidene difluoride  membrane  by electroblotting at  <dig> v in tris/glycine sds buffer for  <dig> hour. nonspecific binding sites were blocked in  <dig> mm tris buffered saline  tween®20) and 5%  non-fat dry milk . the membrane was then treated with anti-flag m <dig> antibody   and anti-goat igg antibody  . finally, peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were used for chemiluminescence detection.

normalization and quantification of hnpp7ex-flag in ccm
all npp <dig> activity assays were performed with concentrated conditioned media  quantified at least twice by western blot analysis. first, a scanning western blot was run with varying dilutions of the ccm immediately after concentration to assess differences in the amounts of protein in the ccm. based on the results of the first western blot, all samples were diluted to the same concentration then again verified by a second immunoblot. a known concentration of the carboxy-terminal flag-bap fusion protein from sigma-aldrich-usa was included on the second western blot as a standard to quantify the amounts of protein expressed for each sample. all protein bands were normalized relative to the flag-bap standard using the totallab software program on a fotodyne imager .

assays of npp <dig> catalytic activity
all assays of npp <dig> catalytic activity were performed three independent times with triplicate samples in each experiment. standard deviations of results from three independent experiments provide error estimates.

fluorescence-based assay
hydrolysis of all three lipid substrates by npp <dig> was monitored using a modification of invitrogen's amplex® red phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase c assay kit. npp <dig> assay buffer was prepared as previously described  <cit>  containing  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm nacl, and  <dig> mm taurocholic acid but without  <dig> mm edta. each well on the plate was loaded with a total of  <dig> μl consisting of  <dig> μl each of substrate, amplex red cocktail  and normalized concentrations of enzyme diluted from ccm. npp <dig> activity was monitored by the level of fluorescence using excitation and emission wavelengths of  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm, respectively. data were collected at  <dig> minute intervals over a  <dig> hour period in a 96-well, half area plate  using a synergy  <dig> multi-well plate reader .

absorbance-based assay
hydrolysis of pnppc was monitored using an absorbance assay system based on the para-nitrophenolate product that has a maximum absorbance at  <dig> nm. each well on the plate was loaded with a total of  <dig> ul consisting of  <dig> ul each of npp <dig> assay buffer, substrate and normalized amounts of enzyme diluted from ccm. npp <dig> activity was monitored by the level of absorbance at  <dig> nm every minute for a  <dig> hour period in a 96-well, half area plate  using a synergy  <dig> multi-well plate reader .

calculation of kinetic parameters
relative fluorescence and absorbance units were converted into product concentrations. for the fluorescence and absorbance assays, varying concentrations of resorufin or para-nitrophenol were used to generate standard curves. the trend line equation from a plot of standard concentration versus fluorescence/absorbance was used to convert all relative fluorescence and absorbance units to product concentrations. curve fitting was done with the kaleidograph software program to obtain km and vmax. kcat was calculated using the vmax obtained and  <dig>  nm enzyme concentration used in all assays.

RESULTS
hnpp <dig> homology models
three homology models of hnpp <dig> were developed using different crystallized npp structures. crystal structures of a bacterial npp were first reported in  <dig>  <cit> . this year, additional crystallographic structures of npp <dig> from two different rodent species became available  <cit> . notably, the bacterial npp and mouse npp <dig> structures have been crystallized in the presence and absence of products, amp and lpa, respectively. figure  <dig> shows that there is essentially no induced fit of the enzyme to these product structures. the similarity between structures crystallized in the presence and absence of product can be quantitated by heavy-atom root mean square deviation  values for atoms within  <dig>  Å of the product. the rmsd values are only  <dig>  Å for the bacterial npp and  <dig>  Å for the mouse npp <dig>  thus either the free or product-bound crystallographic structures should serve equally well as a homology modeling template. amino acid sequence identity is similar between hnpp <dig> and the three available npp structures . however, alignments against the available templates show substantial differences in the number of amino acids that align against gaps in the template structures. the longest stretch of hnpp <dig> amino acids aligned against gaps in 2gso  <cit> , 2xr <dig>  <cit> , and 3nkm  <cit>  were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . models developed from each template structure are shown in figure  <dig>  emphasizing regions in the model that aligned against gaps in the template structure as well as the position of n <dig>  a confirmed glycosylation site  <cit> . the longest gap-aligned stretches all occur in the hnpp <dig> sequence between p <dig> and e <dig>  due to the much smaller gap-aligned segments in the 2gso-based model of hnpp <dig>  this model was used in all docking studies with substrates. two prior modeling studies of hnpp <dig> also used a crystallographic structure of the bacterial npp as the modeling template  <cit> , although one of the studies was published prior to the availability of the npp <dig> crystal structures  <cit> . the insertion of residues in the npp <dig> sequence within the segment interacting with lpa in npp <dig> limits the utility of the npp <dig> crystal structures as templates even though they share a common substrate with npp <dig> 

hnpp <dig> substrate complexes
three natural npp <dig> substrates  and one synthetic substrate  were docked into the model of hnpp <dig>  the natural substrates were flexibly docked with shortened hydrophobic tails and then extended manually. the synthetic substrate was docked flexibly. the docked positions of each substrate are shown in figure  <dig> and 5a three dimensional model of all four in complex with the hnpp <dig> homology model are provided in additional file  <dig>  the four complexes show a common position of the choline headgroup near f <dig> , and a common phosphate group position interacting strongly with one zinc ion  and moderately with the second  . all four substrates extend from the phosphate group along the bottom edge of the parallel β-sheet bundle . only the short acetyl sidechain of paf 16: <dig>  and the long palmitoyl chain of sm 16: <dig>  extend above the edge of the parallel β-sheet bundle . these complexes were used to select a set of mutation sites to provide experimental feedback and validation of the models. the closest heavy atom distances from each of these selected mutation sites to the docked substrates are shown in table  <dig>  based on these complexes, mutation of f <dig> to a non-aromatic amino acid was expected to result in a less active mutant against all four substrates. l <dig> was selected for mutation to an aromatic residue with the expectation that this could introduce a favorable cation-π interaction with the choline group, resulting in a more active mutant against all four substrates. however, l <dig> also makes van der waals contact with the sphingoid chain of sm 16: <dig>  and the more rigid aromatic ring geometry might occlude the space occupied by this chain. three residues located at various positions near the common position occupied along the bottom edge of the parallel β-sheet bundle were selected for mutation, including f <dig>  y <dig>  and y <dig>  one mutation site was selected near the chains extending above the parallel β-sheet bundle, e <dig>  these latter four mutations were expected to show variable differences in activity relative to wild type npp <dig> when tested using different substrates due to the variable contact distances displayed in these preliminary docked complexes. for example, y <dig> interacted closely with the sphingoid tail of sm 16: <dig>  but showed negligible contact with pnppc .

tail 1-16:0
tail 1-sphingoid
hnpp <dig> mutations
hnpp7exflag  was obtained from the medium of transfected hek-293t cells without further purification. to ensure that these cells did not produce and export proteins or factors that would interfere with the amplex red assay, fluorescence readings using assay buffer , ccm from mock-transfected cells, and ccm from npp7-transfected cells were compared . figure  <dig> demonstrates that only the ccm from npp7-transfected cells produced a fluorescent signal using the amplex red assay, and only when alkaline phosphatase was present to convert phosphocholine produced by lplc activity to choline. there was no fluorescent signal in the absence of alkaline phosphatase, eliminating any contribution to the fluorescent signal due to direct production of choline by lpld activity. npp7-wt and selected mutants were then characterized for their hydrolytic activity against paf 16: <dig>  lpa 16: <dig>  pnppc, and sm 16: <dig>  the kinetic parameters obtained from these assays are provided in tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and a graphical comparison of relative activity is shown in figure  <dig> 

two mutants, f275a and l107f, were selected on the basis of their proximity to the choline headgroup of the substrates . relative to npp7-wt activities, the f275a mutant showed either no catalytic function , a 13-fold reduction in kcat/km value  or only a  <dig> -fold reduction in kcat/km value . these results are consistent with the models which suggested that the f275a mutation should be detrimental to the recognition and hydrolysis of all substrates. in contrast to the consistently reduced activity of the f275a mutant, the l107f mutant activity differed from wt in a substrate-dependent fashion. the l107f mutant hydrolyzed paf 16: <dig>  pnppc, and lpa 16: <dig> between  <dig>  and  <dig>  times more effectively than npp7-wt. conversely, sm 16: <dig> was hydrolyzed  <dig>  times less effectively by l107f relative to npp7-wt. these experimental results are consistent with the model-based suggestion that replacement of the nonpolar isobutyl sidechain of leucine with the aromatic sidechain of phenylalanine allowed formation of an additional cation-π interaction with the substrates, but produced crowding against the sm sphingoid tail.

three mutants, f80a, y166a, and y142a, were selected on the basis of their proximity to a hydrophobic tail in all substrates . these mutants showed opposing patterns of relative impact on sm relative to the remaining three substrates. the y142a mutant showed only half the activity of the wt enzyme against sm, but showed similar or better activity against paf, lpc and pnppc . the f80a and y166a mutants showed reduced activity against lpc, paf and pnppc, but showed similar or better activity against sm . this pattern of activity differences was not predicted by the initial model complexes of these substrates. however, the hydrophobic tails of the endogenous substrates had been placed manually, and exploration of alternate tail positions had been limited. molecular dynamics simulations of lpc 16: <dig> and sm were therefore used to allow the substrate tails to explore nearby low-energy placements within the enzyme for a representative substrate from each pattern of activity differences. molecular dynamics simulations showed a time-dependent alternating interaction of the lpc 16: <dig> hydrophobic tail with f <dig> and y <dig> based on distances that oscillated between  <dig> - <dig>  Å and greater than  <dig>  Å . this result is consistent with substantially reduced activity due to mutation at either site and suggests that the hydrophobic tail is not restricted to a confined location, which would be an entropically unfavorable binding contribution. instead, the hydrophobic tail retains considerable flexibility within a broad hydrophobic channel. molecular dynamics simulations on the sm complex provide an explanation for the opposing impact these mutations had on hydrolysis of sm versus lpc. in particular, the distance of the sphingoid tail to f <dig> increased during the simulation, stabilizing at a value over  <dig> Å. this distance is sufficiently high that minimal interactions between sm and f <dig> occur, consistent with the catalytic activity similar to wt for the f80a mutant when tested using sm as the substrate. the sm sphingoid tail remained within contact distance of y <dig> throughout the simulation , although the closest contact involved backbone atoms of y <dig>  the sidechain of y <dig> forms contacts between strands of the β-sheet as well as to a neighboring helix. mutation to a smaller alanine residue may therefore alter the shape or size of the binding pocket for the second tail of sm rather than removing a direct contact. the closest contact of the sm sphingoid tail averaged about  <dig>  Å with y <dig> with a very low standard deviation of  <dig>  Å. a likely explanation for the enhanced activity of the y166a mutant relative to wt for sm hydrolysis is that greater conformational flexibility of the sm sphingoid tail would be accommodated by the change from a bulky tyrosine to a more compact alanine sidechain, reducing the entropic penalty of transferring sm into the npp <dig> binding pocket. figure  <dig> shows a snapshot from the simulation emphasizing the close contact with y <dig> and distance from f <dig>  the rigid alkene portion of the sphingoid chain sits directly above the bulky sidechain of w <dig> , preventing the sphingoid chain of sm from exercising the same flexibility in the wt as the saturated sidechains of lpc 16: <dig> and paf 16: <dig> 

one mutation site, e <dig>  was selected on the basis of isolated contact with the second tail of paf  and sm . e <dig> was mutated to both the similarly-sized glutamine  and much smaller alanine  residue. the mutation to glutamine exhibited minimal differences from wt for lpc, paf and pnppc, but showed a  <dig> -fold enhanced activity against sm. in contrast, the mutation to alanine showed substantially decreased activity for lpc hydrolysis and less drastic decreases for the remaining substrates. figure  <dig> shows that a hydrogen bond between the free glycerol hydroxyl group of lpc 16: <dig> and e <dig> forms during the molecular dynamics simulation of the lpc complex. this hydrogen bond could occur in the e169q but not in the e169a mutant. thus, the simulation results on the lpc complex with npp <dig> are consistent with the observed decrease in activity only of the e169a mutant relative to wt. in contrast to the lpc complex, figure  <dig> shows that the interaction of sm with e <dig> predominantly involves contact between the fatty acyl chain and the e <dig> sidechain. thus enhanced activity due to elimination of sidechain ionization in the e169q mutant and relatively limited activity difference in the e169a mutant are consistent with the simulation results on the sm complex with npp <dig> 

discussion
the choline headgroups of four different substrates are positioned consistently near f <dig> and l <dig> in preliminary homology models of npp <dig> . the l107f mutant was able to enhance the catalytic function of npp <dig> against three of the four substrates tested, with reduced function only against the largest substrate due to steric crowding . this finding was consistent with the preliminary models which suggested a cation-π interaction might form in the mutant to enhance interactions with the choline groups of the three smaller substrates . all other human npp family members have a phenylalanine at the corresponding position. the observed reduction of sm hydrolysis upon mutation of l <dig> to phenylalanine suggests that the presence of a phenylalanine in the other npp family members contributes to substrate selectivity by steric interactions with the bulkier sm structure relative to other candidate substrates. this is unlikely to be the sole factor determining whether an npp enzyme can utilize sm as a substrate as the l107f mutant did not completely lose the ability to hydrolyze sm. the second choline interaction site was probed using an f275a mutant, which showed impaired catalytic function against all four substrates as predicted by the preliminary models . this interaction site was previously described by duan, et al, in their modeling study on npp <dig>   <cit>  they found that an f275g mutant showed almost no sphingomyelinase activity, consistent with our reduced activity of the f275a mutant. perhaps surprisingly, an alignment of the mammalian npp enzymes shows remarkable variability in the residue types that align with f <dig>  neither npp2/atx nor npp <dig> have a phenylalanine aligned with f <dig>  despite shared recognition of phospholipids with choline headgroups. npp2/atx exhibits d <dig> at the corresponding position, which may form a favorable ion pair with the cationic choline headgroup instead of the cation-π interaction observed in npp <dig>  npp <dig> aligns q <dig> against f <dig> of npp <dig>  the role of q <dig> in npp <dig> will require further investigation, since a strongly favorable interaction with the choline headgroup is unlikely. notably, both npp <dig> and npp <dig> have tyrosine residues  corresponding to f <dig>  although the endogenous substrates of npp <dig> and npp <dig> are unknown, the tyrosine sidechain is capable of the same type of cation-π interaction as the phenylalanine sidechain.

in contrast to the very high consistency between the headgroup position in the model and experimental mutagenesis results, the preliminary modeled positions of the substrate tails were not uniformly consistent with the experimental mutagenesis results. molecular dynamics studies indicated that the hydrophobic tails showed dynamic interactions within a channel lined with hydrophobic residues. this dynamic behavior explained how mutation of f <dig> and y <dig> to alanine could both have detrimental impact on lpc hydrolysis although they were unable to concurrently interact with the lpc hydrophobic tail . this finding compares well with the divergent positions of the lpa hydrophobic tails observed in the crystallographic structures of npp2/atx   <cit> . the hydrophobic tails of lpa species in pdb  <cit>  entries 3nkq <cit>  and 3nkr  <cit>  are located near y <dig>  which corresponds to f <dig> in npp <dig>  the hydrophobic tail of the lpa species in pdb entry 3nkp <cit>  contacts w <dig>  which corresponds most closely in the superposition to npp <dig> residue y <dig> in the insertion loop first described by nishimasu, et al. in their comparison of the bacterial npp and npp <dig>  <cit> . the hydrophobic tails of lpa species in pdb entries 3nkn <cit>  and 3nko  <cit>  are positioned intermediately between these two sidechains.

the experimental mutation results are compared in figure  <dig>  and clearly demonstrate a very different pattern for sm relative to lpc, paf and pnppc, which show more similar profiles. sm is the only substrate tested that has two long and flexible hydrophobic tails . in our model, these tails occupy completely different binding subpockets, above and below the conserved β-sheet core. this prediction is in direct contrast to the modeling studies of duan, et al., in which both tails were placed into the region below the conserved β-sheet core  <cit> . in their homology modeling, the loop segment from f <dig> to e <dig> was subjected to refinement to generate an ensemble of loop conformations. conformations were selected for further modeling that kept this lower binding subpocket more open to allow both chains to fit together. our mutation of e169q, which showed  <dig> -fold enhanced hydrolysis of sm with relatively little impact on hydrolysis of the remaining substrates, suggests that the second tail of sm is not occupying the same site as the hydrophobic tails of the single-tail substrates, as more similarity of mutagenesis results between sm and other substrates would be expected. in fact, we interpret the enhanced activity of the e169q mutant against sm as a reduction in the charge allowing improved hydrophobic interactions with the second sm tail. furthermore, figure  <dig> shows that the palmitoyl tail of sm makes close van derwaals contact with the sidechain of f <dig>  consistent with poor sphingomyelinase activity observed for an f141s mutant by duan, et al., a finding that was not anticipated based on the common positioning of the hydrophobic tails of sm in their model below the conserved β-sheet core  <cit> . based on the current results, the f141s mutant is likely to have activity similar to wt npp <dig> against single-tail substrates such as lpc. importantly, as sm is the optimal substrate for npp <dig> out of those tested to date, it is inconsistent to expect that the conformational flexibility of the nonpolar tails would be restricted by common occupation of a pocket of limited size due to the unfavorable entropic contribution that the loss of flexibility would produce. thus several residues in the longer insertion loop found in npp <dig> relative to other mammalian and bacterial npp family members have been demonstrated to play a role in substrate recognition, and likely contribute to substrate selectivity as proposed by nishimasu, et al.  <cit>  based on their comparison of bacterial npp and mouse npp <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the current study has defined important differences in recognition of sm and other phospholipid substrates of npp <dig>  two contributions to the unique activity of npp <dig> against sm have been identified. first is the importance of the amino acid at position  <dig>  npp <dig> has leucine at this position although related npp enzymes have phenylalanine at the corresponding positions. the detrimental impact of the npp7-l107f mutant on hydrolysis of only sm, compared to the positive impacts on the hydrolysis of lpc, paf and pnppc supports our conclusion that this position contributes to substrate selectivity within the npp family. the substrate-specific impacts of the mutations at position e <dig> indicate a second contribution to the unique recognition of sm, a second hydrophobic binding pocket for the second hydrophobic tail that is unique to sm.
