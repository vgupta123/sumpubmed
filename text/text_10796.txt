BACKGROUND
the ubiquitin proteasome system  involves a serial enzymatic cascade of ubiquitin dependent protein degradation through which to prevent aberrant and potentially cytotoxic proteins from forming insoluble protein aggregates  <cit> . chaperones are a group of protein folding catalysts and protein transporters which also emerge as active participants in protein degradation  <cit> . cooperation of constituents of the ups with chaperone proteins mediate a wide range of cellular processes, such as synaptic function and neurotransmission, gene transcription, protein trafficking, mitochondrial function and metabolism, antioxidant defence mechanisms, and apoptotic signal transduction  <cit> . dysfunction of the ups has been implicated in protein aggregation as a possible cause for pathogenesis in a number of the age-related neurodegenerative and chronic neurological disorders  <cit> . parkinson's disease  viewed as a representative of these disorders is characterized by selective death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta  and by appearance of abundant proteinaceous inclusions known as lewy bodies   <cit> .

one of current concepts in pd pathogenesis is to understand the mechanism of lbs. protein aggregation has been demonstrated to play the role in the developmental stages of lbs at cellular and molecular levels  <cit> . substantial progress has been made in understanding of the mechanism for lbs, aggresome-related process  <cit> . according to this hypothesis, dysfunction of the ups contributes to aggregation of aberrant and potentially cytotoxic proteins into insoluble protein aggregates. one protective way cells handle the species of aggregated proteins is to compartmentalize them in specialized inclusions called as aggresomes  <cit> . the aggresome machinery is activated as the last resort if constituents of the ups and chaperone proteins fail to reverse increasing level of the target proteins through transient up-regulation of gene expression in the stressful environment  <cit> . it is supposed that constituents of the ups and chaperone proteins are recruited into aggresomes where aberrant and potentially cytotoxic proteins may be sequestered in an inactive form  <cit> .

however, proteins in aggresomes are to be revealed if we elaborate on possible causation of formation of lbs: largely owing to dysfunction of the ups. currently, the proteomic analysis of proteinaceous inclusions, whether for patients with pd or in vitro models of pd due to disruption of mitochondria, offers a valuable tool to study protein composition of aggresomes  <cit> . traditionally, cellular fractionation has provided the means to isolate a fraction of lbs from brain tissue of lb variant of alzheimer's disease patients  <cit> . therefore, an isolated fraction of inclusions as the starting material is suitable for proteomic analysis  <cit> . although it remained to be determined that lbs are bona fide in vivo correlates of aggresomes  <cit> , aggresomes and lbs are similar in protein composition as well as morphological structures  <cit> . at least, on the premise of the inducible aggresomes in cultured cells  <cit>  and the emphasized purity and yield of organelles isolated through cellular fractionation of samples  <cit> , proteomic characterization of inclusions can advance our knowledge about nature of aggresomes  <cit> .

the aim of this present work was to determinate the proteomic pattern of proteasome inhibitor -induced inclusions formed in pc <dig> cells after proteasome inhibition by psi. our main results were that a fraction of psi-induced inclusions isolated from the cells was qualified for proteomic analysis and that a proteomic feature of the isolated fraction was characterized by the identification of fifty six proteins.

RESULTS
evaluation of cell survival
using the trypan blue staining, we examined the plasma membrane integrity of the cells following exposure to psi for  <dig> h. compared to the cells in dimethyl sulfoxide  vehicle which were only shown as normal living cells excluding trypan blue stain , the cells in psi were shown as both abnormal living cells and dead cells, capable and incapable of excluding the dye, respectively . moreover, we quantitatively evaluated the decline of living cell density in the cells in psi. the percentage of living cells differed significantly between the cells in the vehicle  and psi , p <  <dig>  .

evaluation of a procedure of cellular fractionation
using the hematoxylin-eosin  histological staining, we detected the eosinophilic psi-induced inclusions in the cells with exposure to psi for  <dig> h. compared to the cells in the vehicle which were shown without no morphological change in eosinophilic structure , the cells in psi were shown with distinct eosinophilic inclusions . further, similar to inducible inclusions from pc <dig> cells in psi for  <dig> h or mes cells in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex i inhibitor, rotenone for  <dig> h  <cit> , the psi-induced inclusions appeared with a focal, homogeneous shape and displayed two types of morphology: nucleus-binding and nucleus-free inclusions. it was assumed that some of the psi-induced inclusions were observed in the cytoplasm of the remaining cells, whereas the others were extruded into the extracellular space after destruction of the host cells  <cit> .

at the first stage of isolation, using the h&e histological staining, we detected the eosinophilic psi-induced inclusions, collected in the fraction of initial pellets. by homogenization of the cells with  <dig> % np- <dig> at 37°c for  <dig> min and subsequent centrifugation at  <dig> × g for  <dig> min, an abundance of intact psi-induced inclusions  was yielded. in practice, we also increased the number of nucleus-free psi-induced inclusions. there was a significant difference in the percentage of the nucleus-free to total psi-induced inclusions between the fraction of cells in psi  and the fraction of initial pellets , *p <  <dig> .

at the second stage of isolation, using the h&e histological staining, we first detected the psi-induced inclusions, collected in the temporary and final fractions of resulting pellets. by four time-dependent incubations of the initial pellets with  <dig> u/ml dnase i at 37°c for different lengths of time during the  <dig> h period, the increasing number of nucleus-free psi-induced inclusions were easily yielded at the cost of the gradual decline of nucleus-binding psi-induced inclusions, and of which, when the one of the time-dependent incubations ran out for the entire  <dig> h, the increase of nucleus-free psi-induced inclusions instead of the decline of nucleus-binding psi-induced inclusions could be most easily yielded. in detail, after the four time-dependent incubations for  <dig> h ,  <dig> h ,  <dig> h  and  <dig> h , the inclusive regions of nucleus  but not the inclusive regions of inclusion  within the nucleus-binding psi-inclusions were progressively reduced. the percentage of the nucleus-free to total psi-induced inclusions in the temporary fraction of resulting pellets which was collected after the one of the four time-dependent incubations of the initial pellets for  <dig> h  differed significantly from each of the percentages in the temporary fractions of resulting pellets which were collected after the other three of the four time-dependent incubations of the initial pellets for  <dig> h ,  <dig> h  and  <dig> h , *p <  <dig> . interestingly, by the incubation of the initial pellets with  <dig> u/ml dnase i and  <dig> μg/ml rnase a for  <dig> h, a large quantity of nucleus-free psi-induced inclusions instead of few nucleus-binding psi-induced inclusions was observed in the final fraction of resulting pellets . all percentages in the first four temporary fractions of resulting pellets  differed significantly from the percentage in the final one , **p <  <dig> .

at the second stage of isolation, we detected the alpha synuclein  positive, eosinophilic inclusions, collected in the isolated fraction of psi-induced inclusions, using the alpha-syn immunostaining and the h&e histological staining, and then detected the relatively small amount of histone h <dig> present in the same fraction using the west blotting for histone h <dig>  one of the most abundant proteins in the nucleus  <cit> . in general, subcellular particles, such as cellular debris and technical artifacts, were created after the homogenization at the first stage of isolation, and in particular, nuclear proteins were remained after the nucleus degradation at the second stage of isolation. thus, by centrifuging the final fraction of resulting pellets in discontinuous percoll-mediated 12%-35% gradients at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> min, the intact psi-induced inclusions could be easily divided from these subcellular particles and collected as preparation of the target fraction. on one hand, whether the psi-induced inclusions were formed in the cells in psi  or isolated through cellular fractionation , they were stained as alpha-syn positive, eosinophilic structures. on the other hand, in comparison to the intensive signal of blotted histone h <dig> in gel image and its high level in the column diagram, both of which were characteristic of the large amount of nuclear proteins for the samples of the cells in the vehicle or in psi, the faint signal of blotted histone h <dig> in gel image and its low level in column diagram were characteristic of the trace of nuclear proteins for the sample of the isolated fraction of psi-induced inclusions . in the end, the pure intact psi-induced inclusions were found in the isolated fraction.

two-dimensional  gel-based protein resolution
we detected the protein spot pattern of the isolated fraction of psi-induced inclusions using 2-d gel electrophoresis. since aggresomes in cell culture models of pd act as disposal grounds for insoluble protein aggregates  <cit> , we assessed proteome organization of the isolated fraction of psi-induced inclusions by systematic analysis of protein complexes. lysis buffer was added to the isolated fraction of psi-induced inclusions to split inclusions, and an optimal formulation of rehydration solution was used to dissolve proteins from the split-products  <cit> . in conventional ultrasonic extraction, the enhancement of extraction efficiency is attributed to acoustic cavitation  <cit> . thus, soluble proteins dissolved from the isolated fraction of psi-induced inclusions were successfully resolved in 2-d gel as many individual protein spots. as with the two samples of proteins extracted from the homogenates of the cells in the vehicle and in psi , the sample of proteins extracted from the isolated fraction of psi-induced inclusions was resolved on the left and central regions on 2-d gel . that is the proteins displayed here are acidic and neutral proteins, as consistent with a previous observation that nervous system proteins in rat are mainly composed of acidic and neutral proteins  <cit> . in addition, most of the resolved proteins were within the molecular weight range of protein markers or the ph scale of isoelectric points  or both of them. undoubtedly, the proteomic profiling of the soluble proteins extracted from the isolated fraction was represented by the specific protein spot pattern in 2-d gel. of the protein spots that were better focused in at least three of the four gels, one hundred and fourteen spots were reproducibly observed. each spot was found not to differ significantly in terms of appearance, disappearance and shift. these protein spots of interest were selected for identification via peptide mass fingerprinting  .

it is pointed out that values of both molecular mass and pi supplied in a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight  mass spectrometry  data file are usually theoretical. some of the spots identified as proteins were found to alter their positions across 2-d gel in the present experimental condition. in general, the observed difference most probably reflects mechanisms for the augmentation of ubiquitin fusion-protein expression in eukaryotes when proteasomes are inhibited beyond a threshold level  <cit> .

pmf-base protein identification
we detected experimental pmf spectra of the target protein spots using maldi-tof ms, and then pmf data for protein identification using two on-line proteomic search engines. preliminarily, a total of fifty six proteins were identified after submission of their pmfs to the propound search engine against the single ncbinr database . furthermore, forty eight of the fifty six proteins were consistently identified after submission of their pmfs to the mowse score-based mascot search engine against the multiple ncbinr, swissprot, msdb databases . for example, prolyl-4-hydroxylase beta subunit  identified via its pfm against the single database is shown with a group of ms data, such as  <dig> % sequence coverage,  <dig>  expectation,  <dig> matched peptides and theoretic sequences of the matched peptides . after consistent identification via its pfm against the multiple databases, it was shown with its three comparable score values, viz., a top score value of  <dig>  compared to a runner up value of  <dig>  for ncbinr branch,  <dig>  compared to  <dig>  for swissprot branch, and  <dig>  compared to  <dig>  for msdb branch . the protein was ultimately determined.

among the fifty six proteins, twenty were found to be previously reported components of lbs. these components of lbs identified in the isolated fraction of psi-induced inclusions are listed as follows: two key proteins in the synthesis of neural transmitter dopamine , i.e. tyrosine hydroxylase  and 14-3-3epsilon   <cit> ; two microtubulins, i.e. tubulin alpha <dig> and tubulin beta <dig>    <cit> ; two mitochondria matrix proteins, i.e. atp synthase beta subunit  and ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein  <dig>    <cit> ; cu, zn superoxide dismutase   <cit> ; six proteasomal subunits, i.e. proteasome subunit beta  <dig>  proteasome  <dig> s subunit atpase  <dig> , proteasome  <dig> s subunit atpase  <dig>  proteasome  <dig> s subunit atpase  <dig>  proteasome  <dig> s subunit non-atpase  <dig> and proteasome  <dig> s subunit non-atpase  <dig>   <cit> ; and seven chaperone proteins, i.e. 27-kd heat shock protein  <dig>   <cit> , heat shock protein  <dig>   <cit> , 70-kd heat shock protein 1a/1b   <cit> , 71-kd heat shock cognate protein   <cit> , 14-3-3zeta   <cit> , t-complex polypeptide  <dig> beta subunit   <cit>  and valosin-containing protein   <cit> . comparatively, the twenty eight proteins were newly identified and, if selected for further study, may provide novel clues to our understanding of the potential proteomic candidates of aggresomes in response to proteasome inhibition by psi. for the other eight proteins which were incompletely determined by the profound search engine using the single ncbinr database alone , maybe it's preferable for them to be identified in the future since update on construction of a protein reference database has been considered as a discovery resource for proteomics  <cit> . these proteins, most of which were recognized as a profile of proteins within cellular processes mediated by the ups, a profile of constituents of the ups and a profile of chaperone proteins, are classed into at least nine accepted categories  <cit> . functional classification of the fifty six proteins and their percentages are shown in figure  <dig>  given that in eukaryotes, aggresomes sequester aberrant and potentially cytotoxic proteins from the a wide range of cellular processes mediated through the ups and also serve as sites for the recruitment and concentration of constituents of the ups and chaperone proteins  <cit> , to date the protein dataset are at the level of proteomics valuable for characterization of aggresomes, induced in pc <dig> cells by psi and also in vitro by many other proteasome inhibitors such as lactacystin or mg <dig>  <cit> . moreover, the profile of chaperone proteins, accounting for the predominant portion of the protein dataset and classed into the category of protein folding and transport, have been found in available literatures to share some similarity between protein families and specialize in various cellular localization resources . they are at the level of bioinformatics valuable for providing cellular information on relationship between chaperone proteins, known as aggresome related proteins, and aggresomes, known as intermediate compartments  <cit> .

validation
proteins identified via pmf need validation to show their biological presence. a candidate selected for validation was determined by three criteria as follows: it was significantly focused as an individual spot in 2-d gel and detected as with a desirable group of ms identification data; it has not been reported in published literature on lbs; it matches to commercial specific antibody. thus, we sought to determine whether p4hb, a member of the protein disulfide isomerase  family in endoplasmic reticulum  lumen, was present in psi-induced inclusions in pc <dig> cells with proteasome inhibition, and if so, whether it redistributed from its cellular location resource during the induction of inclusions. we validated p4hb in the developmental process of psi-induced inclusions in pc <dig> cells in psi using the p4hb immunostaining and the h&e histological staining. compared to the uniform immunostaining throughout cytoplasm of the cells in the vehicle , p4hb tended to converge to juxtanuclear regions in the cells in psi . specifically, after proteasome inhibition by psi for  <dig> h, p4hb was present with immunostaining of asymmetric structures throughout cytoplasm and around nuclei ; after the proteasome inhibition for  <dig> h or  <dig> h, p4hb was present with immunostaining of granular and elliptical perinuclear structures ; after the proteasome inhibition for  <dig> h, p4hb was present with immunostaining of spherical structures , which was also shown in the isolated fraction of psi-induced inclusions . further, compared to hematoxylin staining of ovoid nuclei of the cells in the vehicle , p4hb-captured structures stained readily with eosin were present in the cells in psi for the different lengths of time  and in the fraction of psi-induced inclusions isolated from the cells in psi for  <dig> h .

discussion
in this study, proteasome inhibition by psi induced cell death and formation of inclusions in pc <dig> cells. an end point cell death estimated using trypan blue exclusion assay confirmed the effect of proteasome inhibition by psi on survival of the cells. cytoplasmic eosinophilic psi-induced inclusions in the cells were immunostained to visualize alpha-syn positive structures. experimental observations have been providing evidence that application of proteasome inhibitors such as lactacystin and  psi to pc <dig> cells is closely associated with both cell death and formation of inclusions  <cit> . nevertheless, low doses of psi which produces the highest number of inclusions in pc <dig> are not enough to induce massive cell death in the cells, whereas increasing its doses lead to mass damage of the cells which does not allow the visualization of inclusions  <cit> , as shown similarly in pc <dig> cells with exposure to methamphetamine  <cit> . thus, the administration of psi to pc <dig> cells we selected could induce the abundance of cytoplasmic inclusions as well as a massive amount of cell death. besides, morphological maturation of the psi-induced inclusions could allow us to appreciate how their isolation was achieved.

in the study, we developed a three-process fractionation procedure to isolate a fraction of psi-induced inclusions from the cell culture model of pd, and thereafter characterized a proteomic feature of the isolated fraction. traditional fractionation for isolating any population of organelles from cell cultures consists of two major stages: homogenization of cell cultures to release various populations of intact organelles, and fractionation of homogenate to isolate the population of targeted organelles  <cit> . at the first stage of isolating psi-induced inclusions, a first process of fractionation procedure was used to separate the abundance of nucleus-binding and the nucleus-free psi-induced inclusions into the fraction of initial pellets. at the second stage of isolation, a second process of fractionation procedure was used to increase the nucleus-free psi-induced inclusions at the cost of declining the nucleus-binding psi-induced inclusions, after which the whole psi-induced inclusions were enriched into the fraction of resulting pellets; in the next isolation, a third process of fractionation procedure was used to purify psi-induced inclusions into the preparation of target fraction. in the case of the target fraction that should be prepared as starting material sufficient for proteomic analysis, the 2-d gel-based protein resolution and the pmf-based protein identification were used to define a proteomic feature of the isolated fraction of psi-induced inclusions. of a total of fifty six proteins identified, twenty proteins such as th were found to be previously reported protein components of lbs, twenty eight proteins such as eukaryotic elongation factor  <dig>  were newly identified, and the other eight proteins were in lower confidence for information about protein designation. these proteins, most of which were recognized as a profile of proteins within cellular processes mediated by the ups, such as tubulin alpha  <dig>  a profile of constituents of the ups, such as psmc <dig>  and a profile of chaperone proteins, such as hsp <dig>  are classed into at least nine accepted categories. in addition, p4hb, an er member of the pdi family, was biologically validated in the developmental process of psi-induced inclusions in pc <dig> cells after proteasome inhibition by psi.

in nerve endings and particularly brain neurons, it is likely that proteins are easily damaged owing to limitation of intrinsic ability for repair and  regeneration, level of relatively high oxygen and elevated metabolic rate, and enzymatic- and auto-oxidation of neurotransmitters such as da. protein degradation via the ups exerts an effect on the removal of damaged proteins that are extensively linked to cellular processes, such as synaptic function and neurotransmission , gene transcription , protein trafficking , mitochondrial function and metabolism , antioxidant defense mechanisms , apoptotic signal transduction   <cit> . cooperation of constituents of the ups  with chaperone proteins  in protein degradation plays the central role in these processes  <cit> .

i. th identified in the study is regulated at two levels: a long-term regulation involves changes in enzyme synthesis for several days, while a short-term regulation of enzyme activity is arrested by direct phosphorylation of the protein within several minutes  <cit> . alpha-syn diminishes th phosphorylation and activity in stably transfected dopaminergic cells  <cit> . given that alpha-syn aggregation is induced by proteasome inhibitors  <cit>  and that th is degraded through the ups  <cit> , it is not coincidence that th colocalizes with alpha-syn in lbs  <cit> .

ii. eef- <dig> identified in the study is one of the gene transcription factors whose cellular level in protein turnover process is dependent on the ups  <cit> . proteasome inhibition by proteasome inhibitors in cells activates up-regulation of specific members of transcription factor families controlling cellular stress response  <cit> . transcription factors may be trapped by cytoplasmic protein aggregates in response to proteasome inhibition  <cit> . in addition, eef- <dig> is phosphorylated by specific eef- <dig> kinase causing its complete inactivation  <cit> , and relevance of transient eef- <dig> kinase to the ups may define cellular levels of eef- <dig> between dephosphorylation and phosphorylation  <cit> . potentially phosphorylated eef- <dig> might acquire aggregation competence in pc <dig> cells after proteasome inhibition by psi.

iii. tubulin alpha <dig> and tubb <dig> identified in the study not only colocalize with alpha-syn in lbs or other alpha-syn positive pathological structures, but also initiate alpha-syn fibril formation under pathological conditions in vitro  <cit> . the binding between parkin and tubulin led to increased ubiquitination and accelerated degradation of alpha- and beta-tubulins in vitro  <cit> .

iv. the ups can influence mitochondria under pathologic conditions  <cit> . proteasome inhibition by proteasome inhibitors not only increases the generation of reactive oxygen species  in mitochondria  <cit> , but also activates the compartmentalization of mitochondrial proteins in aggresomes  <cit> . the two mitochondrial proteins identified in the study and found as components of lbs, f1-atpase beta and uqcrc <dig>  might be damaged by mitochondrial ros.

v. antioxidant enzyme c, z-sod identified in the study is the most notable component of antioxidant protective defense system in response to oxidative stress by both sod mechanism and hydrogen peroxide system mediated-protein modification  <cit> . proteasome inhibition by proteasome inhibitors has been shown to generate oxidative stress in vitro and potentiate compensatory up-regulation of antioxidants as a protective mechanism against oxidative stress  <cit> . the oxidative modification of c, z-sod is associated with pd  <cit> .

vi. apoptosis is the major mechanism of neuronal death in pd. apoptotic response is quantified by all members of the annexin family, especially annexin v  <cit> . three members of the annexin family were identified in the study. proteasome inhibition by proteasome inhibitor mg- <dig> in a dopaminergic neuronal cell model  rapidly depolarized mitochondria independent of ros generation to activate the apoptotic cascade  <cit> . aggresomes may be viewed as the wrong cellular compartments where apoptotic cascade proteins are sequestered after detrimental effects of proteasome inhibition by proteasome inhibitors on mitochondrial homeostasis  <cit> .

vii. proteasomal subunits are in progress of the tightly coordinated expression and integrated assembly under physiological conditions  <cit> . however, under proteolytic stress conditions elicited by proteasome inhibitors, proteasomal subunits display the alterable profile of expression and composition  <cit> . for example, treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors activates a transient up-regulation of mrnas of all proteasomal subunits  <cit> . the alteration might represent a regulatory feedback mechanism attempting to reverse proteasome inhibition  <cit> , but if the compensatory regulation fails to establish affection, proteasomal subunits are recruited to aggresomes to ubiquitinate and degrade protein   <cit> . one beta subunit of  <dig> s proteasome core particle and five atpase-dependent and atpase-independent subunits of  <dig> s proteasome regulatory particle were identified in the study, but it is not known whether proteasomal subunits rich in lbs exist as individual subunits or as part of the intact complex  <cit> .

viii. cells usually express diverse family members of chaperones and different versions of a family member of chaperones to block protein aggregation  <cit> . the chaperone proteins identified in the study own their specialized protein similarities. the intra- and inter-specific species of chaperones are listed by chaperone proteins rich in lbs, such as members of the hsp <dig> family  and members of the small hsp family   <cit> . in substance, proteasome inhibition by proteasome inhibitors increased initial and concerted expression of major types of chaperone proteins in cytoplasm, er and mitochondria  <cit> . the compensatory induction of chaperone proteins can be beneficial since aggresomes are supposed to recruit both constituents of the ups and chaperone proteins to facilitate protein clearance within the structures  <cit> .

a function for chaperone proteins in targeting aberrant and potentially cytotoxic proteins for degradation via the ups has been established in various ways  <cit> . in substance, act of the ups might depend on the cellular compartment-localized chaperone proteins to guide it along proper pathways  <cit> . what this means is that chaperon proteins in cytoplasm  are required for the ubiquitin proteasome pathway   <cit> , chaperone proteins in er  required for the er associated degradation pathway   <cit> , and chaperone proteins in mitochondria  required for the mitochondria-associated degradation pathway   <cit> . diversity of chaperones among cellular localization resources is listed by spatially restricted subset of chaperone proteins, such as cytoplasmic hsp <dig>  er luminal 78-kd glucose-regulated protein  and mitochondrial hsp <dig>  <cit> . relevance of chaperone proteins in cytoplasm, er and mitochondria to cytoplasmic constituents of the ups establishes multiple routes of the ups to remove aberrant and potentially cytotoxic proteins  <cit> , but in response to proteasome inhibition, constituents of the ups in cytoplasm and chaperone proteins in cytoplasm, er and mitochondria resources, together with the protein substrates of the ups, are induced and recruited to aggresomes   <cit> .

p4hb, also known as pdi  <cit> , is a highly unusual multifunctional polypeptide  <cit> . as with calcium-binding proteins and grps which are two members of the pdi family  <cit> , p4hb acts through erad to eliminate proteins unable to adopt native structure after translocation into the er  <cit> . on the basis of biological information retrieved from the studies with two model animals, pongo abelii  and macaca fuscata fuscata , p4hb has been defined as follows: it acts as a structural subunit of various enzymes, such as proly-4-hydroxylase; it catalyzes the formation, breakage and rearrangement of disulfide bonds; it serves as a natural protector against protein aggregation at high concentration and for protein self-assembly and aggregation at low concentration. given that up-regulation of the pdi family in dopaminergic neurons might contribute to formation of lbs  <cit> , and that the formation of lbs may act to delay the initiation of neuronal death and slow progression in sporadic pd, the members of the pdi family identified in the study might expand the defensive role for chaperone proteins in the development of psi-induced inclusions.

aggresomes are often enriched with aggresome-related proteins such as chaperone proteins  <cit> . next, our task is to establish an immunoblot method for semi-quantitative or quantitative screening of the ten chaperone proteins which were identified in the study but have not been reported in available literatures on lbs. also, further studies will be required to demonstrate whether or not these proteomic candidates are recruited into aggresomes in response to proteasome inhibition by many other proteasome inhibitors . the importance of validation experiments in proteomic analysis and the collection of comparable data from further studies will motivate us to reveal aggresomes in protein content.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the fifty six proteins identified by proteomic analysis are associated with the isolated fraction of psi-induced inclusions in pc <dig> cells after proteasome inhibition by psi, and at this stage of the study, it is speculated that proteomic characterization of an isolated fraction of psi-induced inclusions in pc <dig> cells might offer clues to appearance of aggresomes serving as a cellular defensive response against proteasome inhibition.
