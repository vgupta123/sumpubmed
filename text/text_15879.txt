BACKGROUND
teeth are an important part of the digestive system. there are more than  <dig> genes in the control mechanism of tooth development  <cit> . the majority of those genes are integrated with conserved signaling pathways mediating cellular activity, in particular between epithelial and mesenchymal tissues  <cit> . if a problem occurs related to these genes, the pathway may be blocked and tooth, which is the outcome of the signaling cascade, may not be acquired.

congenital tooth agenesis can be found in many patients during dental practices, and the prevalence of tooth agenesis can be between  <dig> %  <cit>  and  <dig> %  <cit> . the most frequent missing teeth are third molars, with a prevalence of 15–20% of patients  <cit> . the etiology of congenital tooth agenesis is complex and is not clearly known, but generally it can be attributed to genetic and environmental factors  <cit> . developmental anomalies, endocrine tissue disorders, oral cavity originated pathologies, trauma to head and neck region, medical therapies, early received radiotherapy, high fever, wrong nutrition in pregnancy, and rubella-type diseases can be considered as environmental factors  <cit> .

genetically, tooth agenesis can be either syndromic or non-syndromic. the most recent studies show that msx <dig> <cit> , pax <dig> <cit> , axin <dig> <cit> , tgfa <cit> , irf <dig> <cit> , mmp <dig> and mmp <dig> <cit> , axin <dig> <cit>  and fgf <dig> <cit>  genes are related to sporadic type tooth agenesis. peters  <cit>  declared that mice having a mutated pax <dig> gene can show craniofacial abnormalities, extremity anomalies, and teeth developmental problems, such as halted tooth development during the bud phase. he added that all the members of a family having a frame-shift mutated pax <dig> gene had missing permanent first molars, while all deciduous teeth were healthy and properly positioned.

the expression of pax <dig> also modulates the expression of other crucial developmental regulatory genes, such as msx <dig> and bmp <dig>  and antagonistic interactions between fgf <dig> and bmp <dig> or bmp <dig> control the initiation of pax <dig> expression in mandibular mesenchyme  <cit> .

genetic polymorphisms often show ethnic variation. alleles, which are elements of a number of alternative forms of the same gene or same genetic locus  for a character producing different effects, may play role in this issue. for example, the frequency of the variant allele  allele of rs <dig>  a > g was 25% in a brazilian population  <cit>  but 48% in a chinese population  <cit> . some studies have noted the prevalence of congenital missing teeth in a turkish population  <cit> , and limited studies could be found about the genetic background of hypodontia in a turkish community which belongs to caucasians  <cit> . as studies of different ethnic populations are needed to ascertain the association between genetic polymorphisms of pax <dig> and sporadic tooth agenesis  <cit> , the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between two different single nucleotide polymorphisms   of the pax <dig> gene promoter region and hypodontia in a turkish population which is a member of caucasian racial family.

as shown in table  <dig>  we found no significant difference between the control and test groups in either the − <dig> site or the − <dig> site in terms of gene alleles and their distribution to different groups of agenesis . table  <dig> shows the haplotype frequency of the pax <dig> gene in the control and test groups. the haplotype distribution of both polymorphic sites was consistent with hardy–weinberg equilibrium . when haplotypes as alleles were compared, statistically significant differences were found between the control and test groups . when compared with other groups, the ratio of individuals having the ac haplotype was found to be less than control groups in congenitally tooth agenesis cases . it was noticed that in the test group, the individuals having the gt haplotype were less than any other group . no differences between control and test groups were found when haplotypes were organized as genotypes . it was noticed that the ac/gc haplotype group was found three times more often in the test group than the control group, but this was not significant .

we examined two mutagenic regions  of the pax <dig> gene, which were responsible for activating the protein synthesis process. the first mutation described in the human pax <dig> gene was a guanine insertion to the 219th nucleotide in the second exon of chromosome  <dig> of an oligodontia family  <cit> . since this finding, many mutations and one locus deletion of the pax <dig> gene have been reported  <cit> . most of the mutations are located in the paired domain of the second exon.

in our study, two polymorphic regions were examined. no differences were found between the control and hypodontia groups for the a or g alleles  . our findings are not consistent with the findings of peres and co-workers  <cit>  as their outcomes showed a high frequency of guanine and thymine alleles in the hypodontia group. following this, gg  and tt  homozygous genotypes were compared between the control and test groups, and no differences were encountered . these results are consistent with the findings of pan et al.  <cit>  but in contrast with peres et al’s. the reason for this may be due to the adjacency of the turkish and chinese populations in terms of geographical origins  <cit>  and that the brazilian population originated maternally from amerindians and paternally from portuguese  <cit> .

our study comprised third molar agenesis cases, and we consequently found no significant difference between the control and test groups on the basis of alleles or genotypes. in contrast, peres and colleagues  <cit>  found significant relationships for these criteria. in addition, they also investigated the third molar excluded groups and found that these agenesis types were related to heterozygosis phenotypes. in fact, human family analysis revealed that pax <dig> mutations have a strong connection with third molar agenesis, indicating that pax <dig> mutations have a lesser but distinct effect on incisors and premolars.

in our study, the haplotype frequencies of genotypes and their relationship with the patient and control groups were also examined. gt, gc, and at alleles seen in cases of patients with congenital missing teeth were found to be a significant risk. in other words, the individuals having an ac allele were found to have a lower risk of facing tooth agenesis . we conclude that no relationship exists between the ac haplotype and tooth agenesis. in parallel with this finding, when comparing the ac allele with gt, gc, and at alleles, the risk of missing teeth in individuals having an ac allele is  <dig>  times lower than individuals having other alleles . the ratio of the gt haplotype in the control groups was significant. it is possible that subjects having this allele have a low risk of tooth agenesis . the findings of peres et al. were consistent with the present study. after examining the two related polymorphic sites, compared to the ga and aa genotypes, the gg genotype was seen less in the third molar missing group but there was higher frequency in groups missing lower and upper canines, upper central incisors, and lower and upper second molars . thus, we conclude that individuals with a gg genotype are unlikely to show a lack of congenital third molars and are likely to show a lack of canines, first and second molars, and upper central incisors. however, it is not possible to infer this for t-912c .

the discrepancy of the results between the studies may be explained as follows. as demonstrated in our study, genetic polymorphisms often show ethnic variation. for example, in the study of peres and colleagues on the g-1031a polymorphism, the g allele frequency was 25%, but in our study this frequency was  <dig> %. according to the study of pan et al. , this frequency value was 48%. thus, further studies of different ethnic populations are needed to illuminate the exact relationship between the pax <dig> gene polymorphism and congenital tooth agenesis. the second reason is that the diversity of missing teeth phenotypes of patients may give rise to different outcomes. for example 70% of patients lack the third molar in the study by peres , whereas this percentage was 55% in our study. pan  had excluded the third molars. we suggest that this diversity may disappear if future studies are based on genotypes of different populations with the same missing teeth groups. past studies have contributed a great deal to our knowledge about the process of congenital missing teeth. however, the molecular mechanism underlying this abnormality is still not fully described. the mismatch between high incidences of tooth agenesis with low-value findings of agenesis studies  <cit>  suggest that congenital lack of teeth may be a more heterogeneous structure than expected and several independent defective genes working in parallel or in combination with other genes can lead to the formation of specific phenotypes.

for the turkish population, limited number of studies investigating the genetic etiology of congenital missing teeth anomaly was found. to understand the molecular basis of tooth agenesis, to investigate the variations of different populations, and to explain the relationship between genetic variants and variable phenotypes clearly, further studies should analyze both the pax <dig> gene and the other candidate genes, by increasing the sample size and using the latest laboratory techniques that are proven to give more definitive results. in order to develop the curing techniques and connect these results with contemporary medical treatment alternatives in the future, investigators dealing with tooth agenesis may think of gathering samples from oral tissues and build the studies up to the tissue-like structures and engineering methods which might be one of the highest limitations of these kinds of studies in addition with gathering ethical approval for both animal and human studies.

CONCLUSIONS
our study revealed that  in the pax <dig> gene, no significant relationship between the hypodontia group and the control group was found in terms of both the a or g allele in the g-1031a polymorphic site;  the risk of missing teeth in individuals having the ac allele is  <dig>  times lower than individuals with other alleles;  individuals having the gg genotype have a low risk of third molar agenesis;  the subjects having the gt allele can be assumed to have a low risk of tooth agenesis;  polymorphisms in the promoter region of the pax <dig> gene may have an influence on hypodontia in humans.
