BACKGROUND
complex diseases such as breast tumors frequently have genomic mutations, translocations, and increased or decreased dosage of genes. the complex regulatory arrangements are further permuted, producing extreme heterogeneity in regulation and severe analytic complications. such heterogeneity prevents existing methods, which often assume a certain level of homogeneity in samples, from learning underlying regulatory mechanisms from molecular measurements of tumor tissues. this inherent heterogeneity also generates a need for specialized therapeutic response, necessitating the development of models of breast cancer that can incorporate such heterogeneity.

several landmark studies have shown that array-based expression profiling can provide insight into the complexity of breast tumors and can be used to 1) derive a molecular taxonomy for breast cancer, and 2) provide prognostic information better than standard assessment of clinical variables  <cit> . for example, genomic grade, or proliferation index is a strong predictor of outcome in estrogen receptor alpha  positive disease. another example is the 21-gene oncotypedx assay  used to stratify er positive patients into risk of recurrence groups following endocrine therapy. from seminal work published by dr. charles perou  <cit>  and others, classification methods have been, and continue to be, used to define “intrinsic” subtypes of breast cancer. these subtypes include luminal a, luminal b, basal-like, her2-enriched and normal breast-like, and are believed to represent distinct biological entities. moreover, multiple studies have now confirmed that patient survival significantly differs with respect to intrinsic subtype.

a pathway-based classification of breast cancer shows that intrinsic gene expression signatures can be built using knowledge from pathway activity on previously known subtypes  <cit> . the aim of the study was to provide a functional interpretation of the gene expression data that can be linked to therapeutic options. the paper by gatza et al.  <cit>  indicates that the intrinsic subtypes can have further subgroups which may lead to much better understanding of each subtype. recently, a subgroup of basal-like tumors associated with poor prognosis has also been reported  <cit> .

aim of this work
to improve the modeling and inference of regulatory mechanisms from such heterogeneous samples, a biologically based approach to sample and process stratification that models and learns context-specific regulations was proposed and developed  <cit> . the model hypothesizes that genomic  regulation is comprised of two distinct types: convergent regulation and divergent regulation, the former representing a particular set of genes being modulated by different sets of regulators, and the latter indicating a given set of regulators modulating entirely different sets of genes in different cellular contexts. the model also assumes that when a cell maintains a specific cellular context,  it tightly regulates a battery of genes. it is hypothesized that the set of genes under such tight regulation would show rather deterministic transcriptional activities. when the cell moves away from this cellular context or changes to a different cellular state, the behavior of the same set of genes will not appear as deterministic since their behavior is now under the control of various external agents. in this paper, we will illustrate, using the concepts of conditioning and crosstalk, that systematic inquiry of candidate genes can identify a set of cellular contexts where a set of genes is tightly regulated, and corresponding context-specific gene regulatory networks.

genomic regulation of breast cancer subtypes may show several common traits, although they have several unique features that make them distinct. the contexts obtained from this approach can be further used to study the underlying biology of the individual subtypes, which can lead to a better understanding of the differences and similarities between the tumors.

in contrast to previous methods, we used an unsupervised method to identify biologically meaningful cellular contexts within breast cancer. our motivation lies in modeling the heterogeneity of breast cancer with a context-specific approach.

RESULTS
the results section describes the data collection process, followed by the context analysis, phenotype and functional enrichment analysis and survival analysis.

breast cancer data collection and processing
ten breast cancer affymetrix hg-u133a microarray data sets were downloaded from the ncbi geo data repository . these cohorts contain distinct clinical and molecular features such as er+/ er-, pgr+/ pgr-, grade and ln+ and ln- types. table  <dig> lists the data sets along with the number of samples within each cohort. the data from all cohorts were combined and normalized together by rma normalization. a 2-fold change was used to categorize genes as under-expressed, no change or over-expressed; thus generating a data with ternary values {- <dig>   <dig>  1}. the cohorts contain a total of  <dig>  samples with some samples repeated in more than one cohort. after removing the duplicates, a total of  <dig>  samples were obtained. additionally, gse  <dig> contains some cell line data that was removed reducing the number of samples to  <dig> .

 table  <dig>  breast cancer cohorts

geo breast cancer cohorts containing  <dig> samples were reduced to generate the  <dig> sample dataset. †  <dig> overlapping between these cohorts were removed to retain unique samples. ‡  <dig> cell lines were removed from this cohort keeping patient samples only

many variables in the data sets have low variance and may not contribute to network learning. these variables with low variance across all samples were removed from the data sets. this also reduced the dimensionality of the data and made the network learning process computationally more tractable. affymetrix probe sets were matched to hugo gene symbols, probes matching to the same genes were combined by taking the median of the probes with spearman’s correlation of  <dig> . probe sets with lower correlation values were discarded. after filtering at a variance of  <dig>  and combining probes, we reduced the variable size to  <dig>  highly variant genes.

context analysis
a context-specific gene regulatory network was generated for the data using a parallel implementation of the algorithm called expattern . the steps involved in finding contexts from the breast cancer expression data is illustrated in figure  <dig>  a graph with context-motifs filtered at a statistical significance of <  <dig>  after fdr correction was generated. a total of  <dig>  context-motifs generated at this step were clustered using markov clustering   <cit>  to obtain  <dig> clusters, which are referred to as ”contexts” henceforth in the paper. mcl was performed on the graph with an inflation of  <dig>  to keep the granularity high, and connectivity was imposed within clusters, such that each context contained connected context-motifs only. contexts with less than  <dig> samples  may not convey meaningful results and thus were discarded, resulting in  <dig> contexts. specificity of the contexts was measured by computing pairwise jaccard distance between the contexts for both samples and genes  <cit> . the contexts had an average jaccard distance of  <dig>  for genes and  <dig>  for samples, indicating that most of the contexts were well separated with little overlap. a summary of context analysis with respect to the number of associated samples and genes is given in table  <dig> 

results show contexts  obtained after context-motif mining and mcl in column 1; contexts samples associated with a threshold  <dig>  and specificity of  <dig> in column  <dig> and context genes in column  <dig>  context enrichments with clinical and molecular features  are shown in columns 4- <dig>  selected after a statistical significance of <  <dig>  . last column shows intrinsic subtype enrichments with luma=luminal a, lumb= luminal b, basal = basal-like , her <dig> and normal tumors.

clinical characterization and subtype enrichment
following clustering, the contexts were analyzed for clinical and molecular marker enrichments. additionally, intrinsic subtypes were also associated with contexts with statistically significant enriched subtypes. clinical and molecular markers and intrinsic subtypes associated with each context are listed in table  <dig>  a reasonably large number of contexts showed enrichment for at least one subtype. the grouping of er+ intrinsic subtypes  and er- tumors  was clearly evident with the context enrichment. basal-like tumors associated with low survival, showed high grade consistent with previous studies of basal-like breast cancer. additionally, luma and lumb types were enriched with more than one context and basal-like tumors were enriched in several contexts. average jaccard distance of samples for luma contexts is  <dig>  and lumb context is  <dig> . there were no overlapping genes between the luma and lumb contexts. the average jaccard distance of samples for basal-enriched contexts was  <dig> , indicating that these groups are highly distinct and may indicate subgroups of basal-like tumors. table  <dig> shows some contexts enriched with multiple intrinsic subtypes, and we studied this further by grouping contexts and intrinsic subtypes based on their co-enrichments, via hierarchical clustering. enrichments were annotated with ternary values  <dig>   <dig>  - <dig>  indicating presence, absence and, in the case of some clinical features, presence of negative types. clinical enrichments er, pgr, ln status and grade were encoded as “-1” for er-, pgr-, ln- and low grade tumors, respectively, and positive “1” for er+, pgr+, ln+ and high grade tumors, respectively. hierarchical clustering was performed using hamming distance and clusters were chained with complete linkage. the result is shown in figure  <dig>  which indicates biologically relevant groups for subtypes and clinical features. for example, basal-like tumors known to be associated with high grade are clustered with grade. luminal a tumors group with normal-like tumors and luminal b group with her2-like tumors. additionally, correspondence between er and pgr states is also observed in the clustering result.

functional annotation
functional annotation on the contexts with gene sets from msigdb revealed interesting results. the results validate the enrichment of the contexts with er+ and er- tumors, and gene sets pertaining to these characteristics were found. context  <dig> an er+ and luminal-like enriched context showed significant enrichment with luminal-like breast cancer gene sets . context  <dig>  er-, high grade, basal-like context was enriched with er- gene sets and with invasive breast cancer gene sets . context  <dig>  showed enrichment with er- breast cancer gene sets and with basal-like breast cancer gene sets . additional pathways for some selected contexts are included in the supplement tables  <dig> -  <dig> .

survival analysis
survival analysis was performed on the  <dig> samples out of  <dig>  with survival data the kaplan-meier plot in figure  <dig> with survival of basal-like tumors, demonstrates the difference with rest of the tumors  with disease free survival  as the endpoint. the kaplan-meier plot of basal-like enriched context  <dig>  in figure  <dig> not only indicates shorter survival as expected for higher grade, er- tumors but also a larger separation from the rest of the samples including other basal-like tumors. comparison of figures  <dig> and  <dig> clearly indicates a potential sub-grouping within basal-like tumors. kaplan-meier plot of context  <dig>  er+ tumors also indicates a better survival of er+ tumors compared to rest of the samples .

survival analysis results: contexts  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> indicate statistically significant survival difference with the rest of samples.

discussion
several contexts of biologic interest and potential translational potential were highlighted by this analysis that appear both expected, and novel. context  <dig>  indicative of er-positive and pgr-positive, low grade, luminal a and normal-like tumors, was significantly enriched for genes associated with cell cycle checkpoint regulation, specifically, the m phase of mitotic cell cycle . as would be expected for er+ low grade tumors, which tend to exhibit lower levels of proliferation, this context correlated with an increase in median survival . context  <dig> shared the same enriched subtypes as context  <dig>  and contained just  <dig> genes from the same family, magea <dig> and magea <dig>  the potential utility of magea  proteins as a biomarker of the presence of micrometastases and circulating tumor cells has been previously reported  <cit> . we noted that in this instance, the magea genes were associated with tumors that typically have better outcome. it is interesting to speculate whether analysis of magea proteins in circulating breast tumor cells or micrometastases may enhance prognostication in stage iii or iv breast cancer. this has not yet been studied. contexts  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were three of several contexts associated with the basal-like intrinsic subtype and high grade tumors, each with strikingly different apparent molecular underpinnings. context  <dig> contained genes  suggestive of highly angiogenic basal-like breast tumors  <cit> . this tumor context includes positive lymph node status and a decrease in median survival . in contrast to context  <dig>  context  <dig> which contained  <dig> genes, was significantly associated with cell cycle, with no significant difference in prognosis, perhaps due to low numbers of tumors with survival data within this context. context  <dig>  a basal-like context has under-expression of gata <dig> which is in concordance with previous studies of basal-like subgroup, ’claudin-low’ with poor prognosis and more refractory to chemotherapy  <cit>  . lastly, context  <dig>  again a basal-like context of high tumor grade and er negative status contained genes associated with deregulated secretory pathways and mechanisms of docking and fusion of vesicles to target membranes. the gene psenen in this context codes for a gamma secretase and is known to play a role in intramembranous processing of proteins such as notch, a key mediator of cell-fate, tissue patterning and morphogenesis. psenen protein is required for notch pathway signaling  <cit>  and notch signaling is deregulated in breast cancer  <cit> . interestingly, prat et al have also identified a subtype of basal-like breast cancer with notch-associated signaling deregulation  <cit> . additional genes in context  <dig>  point to deregulated mapk, nfkb and pkc signaling, all of which are oncogenic in breast cancer and have been reported to be linked to notch deregulation. as notch signaling is emerging as an attractive therapeutic target in breast and other cancers  <cit> , this context was of particular interest. there was only one sample with survival data in context  <dig> for prognostic evaluation, however the trend was an association with poor survival. context  <dig> is consistent with the low survival of patients with lumb tumors . the above summarizes a sampling of contexts which highlight important unanswered questions in translational breast cancer research. validation of these hypotheses to explain mechanisms of disease progression within sub-contexts of breast cancer have a potential to be therapeutically exploited.

there are a number of well characterized commercially available breast cancer cell lines that mimic various stages of breast cancer progression and biologic characteristics . genes of interest identified as part of a specific context can be experimentally manipulated in vitro using breast cancer cell lines that match the phenotypic and/or molecular context of interest. techniques commonly used to manipulate an individual gene within a viable cell line include rna interference technology, which specifically eliminates expression of any specified target gene, use of target-selective drugs, or use of exogenous dna gene expression constructs, which are engineered to introduce and express a specific gene of interest in a cell. the biological and molecular consequences of manipulating expression of a specific gene can then be measured using cell-based and/or molecular techniques to validate a computationally predicted hypothesis. once verified, this information can be leveraged to develop more accurate prognostic or predictive biomarkers for clinical application.

CONCLUSIONS
this papers demonstrates the application of context-specific gene regulatory networks to identify biological contexts within heterogeneous breast cancer data over many samples. this large sample set identifies a finite number of contexts linked with intrinsic subtypes and clinical parameters. diagnosis of intrinsic subtype is an important step that aids the prognostics for breast cancer. our analysis of intrinsic subtype gene expression signatures is consistent with previous findings of individual cohort molecular profiling studies. previously established intrinsic subtypes show different mechanisms indicating a possibility of further grouping of the intrinsic subtypes. distinct contexts of basal-like tumors confirm the existence of subgroups within basal-like tumors as reported in previous studies. the contextual drivers identified for these subgroups can help explain the molecular aspects for the groups. several new genes were found driving some contexts that have not been previously reported to be associated with known subgroups within these subtypes. functional annotation of the genes associated with contexts also revealed different characteristics associated with each subgroup that can be biologically validated to define signatures for the groups.

future work
the results of the experiments in the paper provide a promising approach to finding gene and clinical signatures associated with intrinsic subtypes within breast cancer. nevertheless, biological validation of the genes involved is necessary and can strengthen the signatures for each context. future directions include testing the results on a independent data set to group subtypes.
