BACKGROUND
cotton  is a well-known and highly important industrial crop that has been grown in more than  <dig> countries located in tropical and subtropical regions  <cit> . it is used as an important source of natural fiber, seed oil and proteins  <cit> . the genus gossypium comprises approximately  <dig> diploid species and five tetraploid species. two tetraploid species, g. hirsutum and g. barbadense, and two diploid species, g. herbaceum and g. arboreum have been extensively cultivated around the world, with g. hirsutum covering >90 % of the total world production and is generally referred to as upland cotton  <cit> . upland cotton has a high yield potential, whereas g. barbadense has superior fiber quality attributes that subsequently gives it a 30–50 % price advantage over upland cotton  <cit> , whereas the low yield and poor adaptation of g. barbadense restricts its production to specific regions around the world. to fulfill the global requirements of the growing human population and the recent advancement in spinning technology justify the need for increased cotton fiber yield and improved cotton fiber traits. fiber quality traits and yield components are quantitative traits that are negatively correlated  <cit> . therefore, it is very difficult to improve all these traits simultaneously by using conventional breeding procedures. moreover, this would also be laborious and time consuming  <cit> .

marker-assisted selection  is prestigious blessing that breaks the linkage among these traits, as it directly selects genetic markers that are tightly linked to quantitative trait loci  other than the conventional procedure of indirectly selecting strains with superior phenotypic performance for breeding. recent developments in field of molecular markers have allowed plant breeders to identify and evaluate complex agronomical traits. the construction of a molecular genetic map is a foundation for the genetic dissection of important economical and agronomical traits, mas, and map-based cloning  <cit> . the first molecular linkage map was constructed in  <dig>  <cit> . since then, several genetic maps have been constructed including interspecific  and intraspecific crosses , to explore the cotton genome and to identify qtls. however, most fiber qtls obtained from interspecific crosses have limited applications to upland cotton breeding programs  <cit>  as most of markers used in interspecific cross do not show polymorphism in intraspecific crosses  <cit> . saturated intraspecific upland cotton maps are useful but more challenging to construct because of the markedly low rate of polymorphisms of molecular markers within g. hirsutum. to overcome this obstacle scientists have employed different mapping populations or used whole-genome sequence-based markers. they used populations involving more than two parents, which have higher polymorphism rates in intraspecific crosses, namely, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  %, thereby ensuring a surge in genetic diversity and facilitating the identification of more qtls  <cit> .

recently physical genome drafts of g. raimondii  <cit>  g. arboreum  <cit>  and g. hirsutum  <cit>  have been completed which could be utilized in the construction of a high-density linkage map and investigate complex traits such as fiber quality. a previous study suggested that the tetraploid species originated from the hybridization of two diploid species, g. arboreum  and g. raimondii  about 1– <dig> million years ago  <cit> . furthermore, more qtls for fiber traits have been mapped to the dt sub-genome of upland cotton compared to that in the at sub-genome, thus suggesting that it may play an important role in fiber developments . a high-coverage genetic map constructed by tang et al.  <cit>  with ssr markers developed from g. raimondii bac-end sequences has revealed that these d genome-based primers are widely distributed and suitable for whole-genome mapping. therefore, because of the importance of the dt sub-genome in determining fiber quality traits  <cit> , we used d genome  sequence-based ssr primers  <cit> , together with ssr primers from cotton marker database  to construct an intraspecific linkage map. previously, sun et al.  <cit>  reported a linkage map based on an intraspecific cross of upland cotton cultivars sgk <dig> and 0– <dig>  they used  <dig> ssr markers to construct a genetic map and identified  <dig> qtls for fiber quality in the f <dig>  f2: <dig> and ril populations in  <dig> environments. we added  <dig> primers to our published genetic map and identified qtls for fiber quality in  <dig> environments, including four previously reported environments  <cit>   to augment our previous results from the same intraspecific ril  population of upland cotton. furthermore we conducted a meta-analyses with biomercator v <dig>   <cit>  using the fiber qtls identified from the present study, those previously reported in f <dig>  f2: <dig> and ril population  <cit> , and those generated from meta-analyses conducted by said et al.  <cit> , along with three succeeding qtls studies  <cit> . we identified some stable and consistent qtls that aggregated into clusters in upland cotton. these qtl clusters can be made more valuable to mas to improve the fiber quality of upland cotton.table  <dig> details of  <dig> environments used to evaluate  <dig> ril along with their parents

construction of a genetic map
in the present study, we obtained  <dig> primer pairs that were clearly polymorphic between the two parents, 0– <dig> and sgk <dig>  these  <dig> primer pairs generated  <dig> loci, in which  <dig> pairs produced two loci,  <dig> pairs yielded three loci, and two pairs resulted in four loci. all  <dig> loci were used in the construction of a linkage map. a total of  <dig> loci were grouped into  <dig> linkage groups. seventy three groups were assigned to  <dig> chromosomes of upland cotton . three groups could not be associated with any chromosome. we named these “ud” following the number. the total recombinant length of this map was  <dig>  cm, which represented approximately  <dig>  %  <cit>  of the total length of the cotton genome, with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers. the at sub-genome spanned  <dig>  cm, consisted of  <dig> markers on  <dig> linkage groups, and with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between adjacent markers. thirty six groups were assigned to the dt sub-genome and comprised  <dig> markers spanning  <dig> .4 cm, with an average of  <dig>  cm between adjacent loci . chromosomes c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> had more markers compared to the other chromosomes. among these, c <dig> had  <dig> loci that encompassed <dig> cm, with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between two adjacent markers. the smallest group, c <dig>  had  <dig> markers, and a total length of  <dig>  cm.table  <dig> genomic distributions of ssr markers and identified qtls

discussion
genetic map
the identification of stable qtls for superior agronomically significant traits and the construction of a high-resolution map are essential for mas. several intraspecific genetic maps have been reported; however, these contain some gaps that limit its applicability in generating a high-density genetic map. major obstacles in the construction of a high-resolution map in intraspecific crosses include a low rate of polymorphism within g. hirsutum and the presence of fixed homozygous genetic blocks  <cit> . therefore, there is a need to identify additional markers that covers these gaps in the genetic map. in the present study, an updated genetic map based on our previous report showing  <dig> markers  <cit>  is described. we have added  <dig> markers including  <dig>  novel swu primers. among these  <dig> markers,  <dig> were mapped to the dt sub-genome and  <dig> were mapped to the at sub-genome. in our previous report, chromosomes c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig> were identified as important and rich in qtls for fiber quality traits  <cit> . most of the new markers that we have successfully added to the map have been localized to these chromosomes, thereby enabling us to dissect these qtls into clusters at a higher resolution, as well as identify some important stable qtls for specific superior features. in the current map,  <dig> chromosomes harbored more than one linkage group, which indicates a relatively low rate of polymorphism in intra specific crosses which was observed at a rate of  <dig>  % in the present study. the observed relatively low rate of polymorphism suggests that the genetic distance between the two parents was very narrow, thereby indicating the need for a saturated intra-specific map. therefore, our next goal is to develop new ssr and snp primers that would facilitate in the construction of a saturated genetic map.

segregation distortion
among the  <dig> mapped primers,  <dig> showed distortion from the normal mendelian ratio, which is 1: <dig> in the case of rils. this severe distortion was also reported by sun et al.  <cit>  and commonly occurs in ril populations that were developed from an introgressed line parent. this high ratio of segregation distortion in our population may be attributed to parent 0– <dig>  which is an introgressed line. tang et al.  <cit>  also reported similar results  in their ril population with introgressed parental line,  <dig>  segregation distortion could be influenced by various factors including genetic factors such as genetic drift  <cit>  and the environment. however, it does not significantly impact the estimation of qtl position and effect  <cit> . the broad sense heritability estimates of fiber quality traits were high for fl, fm, fs and fu, indicating that the qtls identified in this population are more reliable and useful in mas for cotton breeding.

the distribution of qtls was not uniform in the at and dt sub-genomes. among the  <dig> qtls identified,  <dig> qtls  were identified in the at sub-genome, whereas  <dig> were identified in the dt sub-genome. previous comparative meta-analyses conducted by rong et al.  <cit> , lacape et al.  <cit>  and said et al.  <cit>  have indicated that in cotton a higher number of qtls for fiber traits resided within dt sub-genome chromosomes, and gene expression among homologous pairs were not uniform  <cit> . yu et al.  <cit>  also observed 35 % more qtls in the dt sub-genome in an inter specific backcross inbred line population. in the present study a higher number of loci were mapped to the dt sub-genome. this observation might be due to the presence of more ssr markers that were developed from the d genome sequence  <cit> , although this phenomenon has also been previously described by yu et al.  <cit>  in their bc <dig> population. however we also observed that some at sub-genome chromosomes also have more loci than its homologous counterparts in dt sub-genome chromosomes. this unequal distribution of loci indicates the presence of active regions with more recombination frequencies in the upland cotton genome  <cit> . similarly, qtls on both pairs were also not homogeneous. most importantly, homology was observed between homologous pair c6-c <dig> and c7-c <dig>  which harbored qtl clusters and were in agreement with the findings of previous reports  <cit> .

comparison of the tetraploid cotton genome with its ancestors shows that only the a genome  produces spinnable fibers, whereas the d genome  lacks this characteristic. after polyploidization, transposable elements tend to be more active, especially in the dt sub-genome, compared to that in the at sub-genome. furthermore, the dt sub-genome also has a higher mutation rate than the at sub-genome  <cit> . these findings might also contribute to our observation that the dt sub-genome harbored more qtls than the at sub-genome. however, the additional of novel markers for the at sub-genome may improve the assessment of the contribution of each sub-genome in fiber quality traits.

consistency with previously reported fiber qtls
it is very difficult to compare different qtls that have been reported in various populations, although this is necessary to fully understand the behavior of complex traits, particularly in a changing environment. in present study,  <dig> markers were designated as novel ssrs . however, some regions did not have common markers at qtls and thus we were unable to compare these with the findings of previous reports. however some stable qtls with common markers have been identified and were used in our meta-analyses. we identified  <dig> cluster regions. when a meta-cluster contained stable qtls from our ril population and qtls were identified by recent meta-analyses report  <cit> , this was considered as the same cluster. we also confirmed the previous meta-analyses report  <cit> , which in turn allowed us to declare a true stable qtl in this consensus genomic region. for example lacape et al.  <cit> , shen et al.  <cit>  and sun et al.  <cit>  reported qtls for fiber strength and length that were linked to primers bnl <dig>  tmk <dig>  and bnl <dig> on c <dig>  we have identified two clusters that were tightly linked to these primers. four qtls for fiber quality traits fe, fl, fm and fs were closely linked to primer bnl <dig> and tmk <dig>  four qtls for the fiber quality traits, fe, fl, fs, and fu were tightly linked to bnl <dig>  these qtls were in two meta-cluster regions c25-cluster-1:0–20 cm and c25-cluster-2-25-45 cm. our results confirm the findings of said et al.  <cit>  as well as declare that these qtls are indeed stable. we also verified its physical position in the genome sequence of g. hirsutum. qtl analysis on the basis of the physical map also confirmed that these loci were closely linked to these fiber quality traits. however, additional studies confirming the presence of putative genes in this region are warranted. meta-clusters that harbor qtls from our ril population and the latest qtl studies except for those identified by said et al.  <cit>  were regarded as new meta-clusters in the present study. of the  <dig> meta-clusters,  <dig> clusters with  <dig> qtls were considered similar to that of a previous report  <cit> . in addition, we identified seven novel cluster regions with  <dig> qtls for fiber quality traits in the present study. the cluster on cons.c <dig>  c4-m-cluster- <dig>  which contained  <dig> qtls including five fiber quality traits fe, fs, fl, fu, and fm was considered as novel. three stable qtls identified in our ril population qfe-c4- <dig>  qfm-c4- <dig>  and qfl-c4- <dig> and one stable qtl identified by tang et al.  <cit> , qfs <dig>  were also detected in this cluster region. the cluster on c <dig>  c7-m-cluster- <dig> which contained six qtls for three fiber traits fl, fs, and fu was considered as a novel cluster. one stable qtl, qfs-c7- <dig>  which was identified in our ril population and one qtl, qfu <dig>  identified by tang et al.  <cit> , were also confined in this cluster region. on cons.c <dig>  c14-m-cluster- <dig> and c14-m-cluster- <dig> were respectively identified as novel clusters. the c14-m-cluster- <dig>  contained  <dig> qtls including six stable qtls for five fiber quality traits, were identified in our ril population. c14-m-cluster- <dig> contained three stable qtls that were identified in our ril population and one stable qtl qfs <dig> , that was earlier identified by tang et al.  <cit> . on c <dig> and c <dig>  c15-m-cluster- <dig> and c20-m-cluster- <dig> were considered as novel clusters, respectively . on c <dig>  c25-m-cluster- <dig> which contained six qtls for fiber quality trait was considered as a novel cluster. fine mapping of c <dig> was also performed and discussed separately  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
qtls detected in different environments are stable qtls  <cit> , that may be utilized in mas and ril population are useful in the detection of stable qtls in multiple environments  <cit> . we have identified  <dig> qtls, of which  <dig> qtl clusters were identified in an intraspecific ril population in  <dig> environments. meta analyses results have revealed that  <dig> fiber qtls in the ril population were in agreement with the findings of previous reports. we have identified seven novel cluster regions that contained  <dig> fiber qtls, including  <dig> qtls from the ril population. qtl clusters on c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> were identified as stable across multiple environments and populations. therefore, these clusters were considered important for cotton breeders and can be utilized in mas to improve fiber quality.
