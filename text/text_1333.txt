BACKGROUND
spindle assembly involves the activities of multiple proteins that participate in localized microtubule nucleation, dynamics, and organization  <cit> . one of these proteins is tpx <dig>  <cit> . tpx <dig> was initially identified as a microtubule-associated protein  responsible for the localization of the kinesin-like protein xklp <dig> to microtubule minus ends during mitosis  <cit> . in tissue culture cells, tpx <dig> is cell cycle regulated  <cit> . it accumulates in the nucleus during s/g <dig>  at the spindle poles during mitosis, and it is degraded in early g <dig>  in addition, experiments in xenopus egg extracts have shown that tpx <dig> is regulated by the gtp-bound form of ran  <cit>  and triggers the local nucleation of microtubules around chromosomes. this activity is essential for spindle assembly in the presence or absence of centrosomes, in egg extract, and in tissue culture cells  <cit> . recently, it was found that tpx <dig> reduces microtubule growth and shortening by reducing the tubulin subunit off-rate from the microtubule tip  <cit> .

tpx <dig> has other important functions, including a role in spindle pole organization  <cit>  and in targeting and activating the mitotic kinase aurora a . recent research points to other functions of tpx <dig> in non-mitotic cells  <cit> . for example, during interphase, tpx <dig> is recruited into the nucleus where it seems to have an alternative function in the cellular response to dna damage  <cit> ; a function in neurogenesis has also been shown  <cit> . knowing the structure of tpx <dig> would help to understand the complex interactions and different locations of tpx <dig>  however, little is known about the structure of tpx <dig> proteins.

homologs of tpx <dig> were described in chordata and in plants, where the function of the orthologue was functionally demonstrated  <cit> . but, the high sequence divergence of the tpx <dig> family of proteins and its presumed absence in other organisms has made difficult its phylogeny analysis to trace its emergence and evolution. the n-terminal aurora a binding motif was identified in various species at the base of metazoa  or even of eukarya   <cit> .

later, a homolog in drosophila, d-tpx <dig> , was identified that has low sequence similarity to the spindle-microtubule associated part but not to the aurora a binding domain  <cit> . d-tpx <dig> localized with kinetochore microtubules in early mitosis and thus was proposed as the ortholog of tpx <dig>  however, this proposed ortholog did not recapitulate most of tpx <dig> function. in addition, this short version of tpx <dig> was not found in ants, bee or wasp, which have instead the vertebrate/plant like version.

to complete the evolutionary and structural information on the tpx <dig> family we therefore decided to search for further homologues of tpx <dig>  using sequence similarity analysis on sequence databases. we found further paralogs in drosophila and remote full length homologs in fungi. additionally, our analysis revealed the presence of a variable number of tandem repeats in the c-terminal of all tpx <dig> related proteins making up a domain that covers more than 2/ <dig> of the chordata tpx <dig>  which we predict to adopt an alpha-solenoid conformation. these findings have important consequences for our understanding of the interactions, functions and regulation of tpx <dig> 

methods
computational sequence analysis
initial identification of the repeats was done with hmmer  <cit>  and we applied the rep algorithm  <cit>  for the detection of all the instances of the repeat. alignments were produced with hmmer  <cit> , t-coffee  <cit>  and muscle  <cit>  using default parameters and were slightly refined manually. phylogenetic trees and the image of the alignment were produced with clustalw  <cit> .

protein secondary structure was predicted using the manually curated alignment of the repeats with jnet   <cit>  for different repeats of the human protein, and using full length human tpx <dig> with sable  <cit> .

protein expression and purification
full length arabidopsis and xenopus tpx <dig> were expressed as recombinant six-histidine tagged n-terminal fusion proteins. briefly, bacteria bl <dig>  cells were grown at an optical density of  <dig>   and induced for 5 h with iptg at 1 mm. bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and cell pellet were resuspended in a solution containing 15 mm imidazole, 20 mm hepes, 150 mm kcl, 1 mm dithiothreitol , ph <dig>  and  <dig> % triton x- <dig>  cells were sonicated, centrifuged and the soluble fraction was incubated with 5 ml complete his-tag purification resin  at four degrees for 2 h with continuous inversion mixing. after  <dig> washes of lysis buffer, proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. finally, proteins were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography with a superdex  <dig>  equilibrated with 10 mm napo <dig>  ph  <dig>  and proteins concentration was determined by bradford.

cd spectropolarimetry
circular dichroism  spectra from tpx <dig> proteins  were recorded on a on a jasco- <dig> spectropolarimeter at 25 °c, over the wavelength range of  <dig> to 260 nm with  <dig>  mm path. the spectra in the far-ultraviolet region required an average of ten scans and were subtracted from blank spectra performed with buffer  <cit> . secondary structure content was estimated using the k2d <dig> method  <cit> . the predicted percentages of secondary structure for attpx <dig> and xltpx <dig> indicated high alpha helical content  with some beta-sheet .

three-dimensional  model prediction and validation
structural modeling and visualization of the protein structure of tpx <dig> repeats were performed using iterative threading assembly refinement   <cit> . amino acid sequence  of each repeat from x. laevis tpx <dig>  was uploaded in fasta format to i-tasser and tertiary structures were predicted in pdb format for individual repeats. energetic stability of each repeat was evaluated with frst energy validation software  <cit>  and each repeat model was examined for its compatibility with the sequence alignment. an initial structural model of x. laevis tpx <dig> was assembled with pymol   <cit> . then the model was further refined by an iterative procedure. to validate the structural model, we assessed its quality in terms of covalent bonds, packing, torsion angles and flexibility.

RESULTS
identification of tpx <dig> homologs
we searched the sequence databases for putative homologs of vertebrate tpx <dig>  in addition to the previously described homologs, we found full length homologs in multiple fungal species without a clear pattern in their taxonomic distribution. differently, we appreciated a clear taxonomic pattern within insects, where whole length orthologs were found in hymenopterans , while dipterans  had a shorter version . in addition to d-tpx <dig> we could identify two other paralogs in drosophila .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic trees of tpx <dig> homologs. a phylogenetic tree of full length orthologs of tpx <dig> in representative species. b phylogenetic tree of short orthologs of tpx <dig> in representative dipteran species. drosophila has three paralogs. the labels indicate species and length of the protein. numbers in the tree represent bootstrapping values. the sequences and ncbi identifiers are available as additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig> for  and , respectively. the multiple sequence alignments used to do the phylogenetic trees are available as additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig> for  and , respectively




multiple sequence alignment of the tpx <dig> protein homologs revealed a highly conserved c-terminal region. the n-terminal aurora a binding motifs identified in  <cit>  aligned also with the fungal and hymenopteran homologs .

for comparison, there are currently three entries in the pfam database of protein domains  covering human tpx <dig>  aurora-a bind , matching aa 1– <dig>  is found in  <dig> species restricted to euteleostomi , and thus seems not to cover all the sequences having the aurora a binding motif. the other two have much wider distributions. tpx2_importin  matching aa 361– <dig> and tpx <dig>  matching 662– <dig>  are found in  <dig> and  <dig> species, respectively: in plants, stramenopiles , fungi , alveolata , choanoflagellida  and diverse metazoa.

the pfam hits do not match dipteran homologs, reflecting their divergence from the long version of tpx <dig>  neither pfam hits, nor our own results included matches in caenorhabditis species.

the c-terminal part of the tpx <dig> homologs shares a series of repeats
careful inspection of the alignment of the tpx <dig> homologs indicated a number of blocks of conservation that were apparently repeated in several parts of the alignment. as this was an indication of putative protein repeats, we followed an iterative procedure to define these repeats, align them, and identify new ones within these sequences. the multiple sequence alignment of tpx <dig> repeats from human, xenopus laevis and arabidopsis thaliana is displayed in fig. 2a.fig.  <dig> repeats in tpx <dig> proteins. a multiple sequence alignment of tandem repeats in xenopus laevis, human and a. thaliana tpx <dig>  the red box indicates a summary of predictions for an alpha-helix . b position of repeats in human tpx <dig>  uniprot database identifiers are q6nuf <dig> for xltpx <dig>  q9ulw <dig> for tpx2_human, and f4i2h <dig> for attpx <dig>  the multiple sequence alignment is available as additional file 5





the repeat length is of about  <dig> aa, and the occurrence of nine repeats in tandem at the c-terminal of these sequences, plus small inserts between repeat units, results in a domain of about  <dig> aa, thus covering the majority of full length tpx <dig> .

computational prediction of secondary structure of the repeat region indicated the presence of alpha-helical structure in the first half of the repeat . no coherent predictions could be obtained for the rest or the repeat unit.

the c-terminal part of the tpx <dig> is α-helical
to validate our computational predictions, we generated recombinant xenopus laevis and arabidopsis thaliana tpx <dig> proteins . after purification, proteins were submitted to sds-page followed by coomassie staining to assess their degree of purity . both proteins migrated as a single band at around 90 kda, as expected by the predicted molecular weight for xltpx <dig>  and attpx <dig> .fig.  <dig> biochemical and structural analysis of tpx <dig>  a sds-page analysis of xenopus and arabidopsis tpx <dig> proteins. b spectra in the region of 260–190 nm were obtained at 25 °c for full length xltpx <dig> and attpx <dig>  both spectra present a typical alpha helical profile with two minima . c molecular model of xltpx <dig>  represent a compact structure of repeated α-helices linked by a flexible loop. d ramachandran plot of the xltpx <dig> model. about 96 % of all residues were in favored regions, and about  <dig> % of the residues were in an allowed region. two outliers were found, leucines at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  although, visual inspection did not reveal any steric clash




to investigate tpx <dig> secondary structure, both proteins were analyzed by circular dichroism . interestingly, cd spectra in the far-uv region, revealed two ellipticity minima at 208 nm and 222 nm, characteristic of proteins with high alpha-helix structure content . the predicted percentages of secondary structure for attpx <dig> and xltpx <dig> indicated an alpha helical content of  <dig> and 68 %, respectively, connected by coil or unstructured region structure accounting for  <dig> and 34 % of the secondary structure. these findings are consistent with the alignment generated and the presence of a conserved repeat in the c-terminal of tpx <dig>  to further validate our findings we performed three dimensional structural modeling of xltpx <dig> c-terminal domain . the tpx <dig> model, was generated by modelling each repeat defined in fig. 2a. for each individual repeat, amino acid sequences were uploaded in fasta format to i-tasser. the predicted structures for each repeat were selected based on the confidence score , energetic stability and its compatibility with the structural prediction obtained by sequence alignment. consequently, the final model was built with homology to the following structural pdb templates: 3x29a, 4cgya, 4h0sa, 2be4a, 4ixja, 1ad <dig>  2q1fa, x4by6a and 5j0h. the average values of the models for all the repeats were c-score = − <dig> , estimated tm-score =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and estimated rmsd =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  Å. the structural model of xltpx <dig> was further refined, using an iterative procedure with 3drefine  <cit>  and galaxyrefine software  <cit> . the quality and validity of the structural model was confirmed using the protein structure evaluation suite & server  <cit> . upon analysis, we could confirm that the structural model was coherent based on its ramachandran diagram , obtained with the rampage software  <cit> . interestingly, no beta strands were visualized in these repeats, and predominance of alpha helical content was calculated as seen by the three dimensional representation and ramachandran plot . taken together, these results suggest that tpx <dig> repeats are mostly composed of alpha helices, although experimental structural validation will be needed to confirm this result.

discussion
the tpx <dig> family of proteins of microtubule nucleators seems to be present in full length  in most eukaryotic species, with apparent loses in scattered taxa  or substitutions for shorter forms . tpx <dig> proteins share a c-terminal region, which is necessary and sufficient for their activity in triggering microtubule nucleation  <cit> . our computational and biophysical analysis of tpx <dig> shows that this region is composed of a variable number of tandem repeats containing alpha-helical segments. there are many structural repeats formed by alpha-helices  that are often involved in protein-protein interactions  <cit>  and have been described as alpha-solenoids  <cit> . at a length of  <dig> amino acids, tpx <dig> repeats fit very well with the lengths described for these types of repeats. we hypothesize that tpx <dig> interacts in this region with one or more protein partners, being this interaction crucial for tpx2-mediated microtubule nucleation.

a 3d structure of a complex between a xenopus laevis tpx <dig> fragment in the repeat region was solved in complex with importin-alpha   <cit> . this shows that the nuclear localization signal in x. laevis tpx <dig> 284-krkh- <dig> is recognized by importin-alpha . the fragment used was 270– <dig> because smaller fragments did not give good quality crystals for x-ray crystallography. residues 327-kmik- <dig> were bound to another recognition site in importin-alpha . we take the fact that the fragment that successfully formed a crystal includes a full repeat  as an indication that our definition of the repeat unit is correct. in this structure, the tpx <dig> fragment is solved in only two stretches that are extended and seem not to adopt secondary structure. the arrangement of the fragments does not agree with an expected folded structure of the repeat where the start and end occupy positions near in space, as it is usual in structural units of tandem repeats  <cit> . we hypothesize that the nuclear localization signal in tpx <dig> is hidden and becomes exposed upon interaction with other molecules which would disorganize the repeat unit holding it  separating the repeats 1– <dig> from the 4– <dig>  we have proposed a similar unfolding mechanism of tandem repeats triggered by phosphorylation for the mineralocortocoid receptor, which contains a region with tandem repeats that holds multiple phosphorylation sites  <cit> . similarly, human tpx <dig> has a number of phosphorylation sites in the tandem repeat region that are cell cycle dependent . this could be a general mechanism by which the structural flexibility of tandem repeats could be exploited.

here, by finding full length homologs in fungi and other primitive unicellular species, we have completed the phylogenetic distribution of the tpx <dig> family, which seems to have appeared very early after the emergence of eukaryotic organisms, pointing to an ancient and crucial function in the organization of cell division. regardless, it has been noted that the variability of domain organization of the members in this family suggests that while tpx <dig> functions might be widely conserved in eukarya, diverse functional modules could be placed in different proteins or functions performed by other protein families  <cit> . tpx <dig> apparent absence in many fungal species, or its replacement with a shorter version in dipterans agrees with this.

accordingly, although a homolog of tpx <dig>  tpxl- <dig>  was identified by homology to the aurora a kinase binding domain in c. elegans  <cit> , the authors were not able to demonstrate the nucleation activity of this protein characteristic of the tpx <dig> proteins family  <cit>  and the sequence similarity to the aurora a kinase binding site was challenged  <cit> . therefore, there is not enough evidence to claim that this particular c. elegans protein is a tpx <dig> homologue  <cit>  and thus caenorhabditis, like dipterans, seems to have got away with a different system to substitute tpx <dig> function.

in all, our analyses suggest a structure for a large fraction of the tpx <dig> protein while stressing their evolutionary flexibility. the tandem repeat region could be involved in transient protein-protein interactions regulated by cell-cycle dependent phosphorylation. we trust that this information will be helpful to direct future experiments in any of the members of this taxonomically widely distributed family.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we have characterized a novel repeat region in the spindle pole protein tpx <dig>  we predict that this region folds into a domain composed of an ensemble of alpha-helical tandem repeats. this region covers more than 2/ <dig> of the protein, thus this is an important result since so far there is absolutely no structural information regarding tpx <dig>
