BACKGROUND
methylotrophs are microorganisms able to grow on reduced c <dig> compounds such as methane and methanol as sole source of carbon and energy. methylotrophy has gained increasing interest over the past decade for both basic and applied purposes, since methanol can be produced from diverse renewable sources and represents a valuable feedstock for biotechnological applications  <cit> . recent progress in the biochemistry, genetics, genomics, and physiology of methylotrophic bacteria has shown that methylotrophy is a phenomenon much more widespread and versatile than initially assumed  <cit> . the phylogenetic distribution of methylotrophy is broad and spans over a range of phyla and genera  <cit> . methylotrophic bacteria are adapted to various lifestyles and ecological niches , and are involved in a number of important biological or biogeochemical processes, in particular the global carbon cycle. methylotrophy encompasses diverse metabolic capabilities or behaviors that were used to classify them, e.g. obligate vs facultative methyltrophy, heterotrophic vs autotrophic growth, aerobic vs anaerobic metabolism. such genetic and biochemical diversity may explain the ecological success of methylotrophs, which can represent dominant microbial populations in specific environments, e.g. plant leaves  <cit> .

from the biochemical point of view, methylotrophy relies on specific pathways  ensuring all growth requirements. energetic requirements are enabled by dissimilation pathways, which involve a series of three basic steps: i) the oxidation of primary c <dig> substrates - methanol, methylamine - typically into the toxic intermediate formaldehyde, ii) the oxidation of the latter compound into formate, and iii) formate oxidation into carbon dioxide . in addition, alternative dissimilation mechanism exist in which formate is not involved. the assimilation of c1-units can be achieved by different mechanisms starting from either formaldehyde , co <dig>  or methylene-tetrahydrofolate  + co <dig> . novel enzymes, biochemical mechanisms, and metabolic pathways have been discovered, resulting in a more complete description of methylotrophic pathways and their diversity. interestingly, these findings do not modify our current view of the general organization of c <dig> pathways, but show that many more alternative enzymes or pathways than initially assumed carry out each of the basic steps of methylotrophy. moreover, a growing number of newly discovered methylotrophs have been investigated, showing that different combinations of the various pathways can be found in nature, and leading to the concept of a modular metabolism  <cit> .

considerable progress was made in the understanding of the biochemistry and physiology of methylotrophy, and valuable insights were obtained regarding the organization and operation of central carbon metabolism  <cit> . however, a complete, system-level description of methylotrophy metabolism is currently lacking. the comprehensive understanding of bacterial physiology requires a detailed knowledge of the complete metabolic potential of the studied organism, but such knowledge is currently missing and no genome-scale metabolic network has been so far established for any methylotrophic bacterium. in consequence, little is currently known about the network-scale organization of methylotrophy, the specific properties of methylotrophic networks, and how the methylotrophic capacity emerges from this organization, especially in facultative representatives. among the recently sequenced organisms, the alphaproteobacterium methylobacterium extorquens am <dig> is a major model of methylotrophic bacteria. this facultative methylotroph is able to grow on c1- but also on multicarbon  compounds. methylobacterium spp. are part of the abundant population of bacteria systematically found in the phyllosphere  <cit> , where they benefit from plant-derived methanol  <cit> . the biochemistry, genetics, and physiology of m. extorquens am <dig> has been extensively investigated, and allowed the discovery of major methylotrophic pathways, including the serine cycle  <cit> , the tetrahydromethanopterin -dependent pathway for formaldehyde oxidation  <cit> , and of a number of novel enzymes or enzyme functions -dependent methanol dehydrogenase, formaldehyde activating enzyme, methylene-h4mpt dehydrogenases coupled to pyridine nucleotides, and formyl-methanofuran hydrolase). the central metabolic pathways were progressively unraveled, and the application of novel experimental strategies - metabolic modeling, metabolic flux analysis, omics technologies - provided valuable insights into the topology and operation of central carbon metabolism  <cit> . finally, the pathway for methanol assimilation in m. extorquens am <dig> was recently completed with the discovery of the ethylmalonyl-coa pathway , an alternative to the glyoxylate cycle for the synthesis of glyoxylate, which encompasses an unusual series of  <dig> reactions where intermediates are all coenzyme a  esters  <cit> . finally, the genome of this bacterium was recently sequenced and annotated  <cit> , providing inevitable information for genome-scale investigations.

in this work, we report on the integrated, system-level investigation of the metabolic network of the facultative methylotroph m. extorquens am <dig>  as a valuable model of methylotrophic bacteria. in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the biochemistry and physiology of this bacterium, we first evaluated its complete metabolic potential by compiling current biochemical knowledge and genome annotation data into a comprehensive genome-scale representation of the metabolic network. then, we performed both in silico and experimental investigations to identify the subnetwork operating during methylotrophic growth, in order to analyze structurally and functionally the system-level organization of methylotrophy with an emphasis on the properties of the organization of central carbon metabolism.

RESULTS
metabolic network reconstruction
the genome-scale  metabolic network of m. extorquens am <dig> was reconstructed according to previously established guidelines  <cit> . the details of the process are given in material and methods and are schematically shown in additional file  <dig>  briefly, the gs metabolic network was obtained by integrating relevant information collected from i) genome annotation  <cit> , ii) published physiological, genetic and biochemical studies in m. extorquens am <dig> and closely related organisms iii) biochemical information contained in databases  <cit> , vi) complementary investigations , and intensive refinement . the chemical composition of m. extorquens am <dig> cell was determined experimentally or taken from available literature  and used to define the biosynthetic needs and corresponding pathways.

the refined reconstruction was converted into a mathematical model using cellnetanalyser  <cit>  and the network was checked for self-consistency and curated to allow biosynthesis of all cell components from each of the  <dig> carbon sources established for m. extorquens . in addition, flux balance analysis  was used to calculate the theoretical maximum growth yields for each carbon source. for methanol and succinate, the theoretical maximum growth rates could also be calculated and were in agreement with published data , showing the consistency of the network with experimental observations. last, the capability of the gs network to explain the oxidation of carbon compounds  <cit>  was validated .

the final gs network  contained  <dig> unique reactions and  <dig> metabolites, and was based on a gene-to-protein-to-reaction  association network that included  <dig> genes encoding  <dig> proteins . the confidence in the network information was established by scoring the evidence currently available for each reaction  <cit> . the confidence scores ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with the latter being assigned to a reaction with direct evidence for both gene product function and biochemical reaction . the average confidence score over the final network score was  <dig> .

main features of the genome-scale metabolic network of m. extorquens am1
m. extorquens am <dig> is a facultative methylotroph able to utilize a relatively narrow range of substrates. the ability to grow on c <dig> and c <dig> organic acids - e.g. lactate, pyruvate, succinate or malate - relies on the presence of common metabolic pathways, which include the tricarboxylic acid  cycle, anaplerotic pathways, gluconeogenesis, pentose-phosphate pathway , and entner-doudoroff  pathway . growth on c <dig> compounds relies on specific metabolic pathways that were resolved for this bacterium in the past  <dig> years  <cit> . the first step is the oxidation of primary c <dig> substrates - e.g. methanol - to formate via methanol dehydrogenase and the h4mpt-dependent c <dig> pathway. formate is a key branch-point to trigger the flow of carbon between dissimilation and assimilation. dissimilation is achieved by oxidation of formate into co <dig>  the assimilation of c1-units requires the conversion of formate into methylene tetrahydrofolate , since the spontaneous condensation of formaldehyde with thf was demonstrated not to be significant  <cit> . in the serine cycle, me-thf is condensed with a c <dig> compound - generated from glyoxylate - to build c <dig> compounds such as 2-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate , which are further carboxylated to form oxaloacetate  and other c <dig> intermediates. the continuous operation of the serine cycle requires the operation of the recently discovered emcp which allows glyoxylate regeneration and involves co <dig> fixation. these pathways are tightly embedded into each other and the consequences of such organization will be detailed later. the c <dig> compounds used as carbon source enter metabolism at the level of the emcp, from which they feed the central pathways. m. extorquens possesses also the ability to oxidize  <dig> additional compounds  <cit> . these compounds include a significant number of sugars, mainly pentoses. the reconstruction data suggest that such capability is due to the occurrence of soluble sugar dehydrogenases able to oxidize a wide range of pentoses and other sugars  <cit> ; however, no assimilation processes were identified from the genome annotation. the reconstructed network contains a potential pathway for the utilization of two sugars  as carbon source, although m. extorquens is not known to grow on these compounds. the identified pathway includes the periplasmic oxidation of glucose into gluconate, which could be internalized and catabolized through the pentose phosphate pathway  or the entner-doudoroff  pathway. the glycolytic pathways are quite well established  but the relevant sugar transport systems have low annotation confidence scores. further experimental investigations will be necessary to determine whether m. extorquens possesses or not the entire enzymatic repertoire for sugar utilization.

the detailed examination of the biosynthetic pathways included in the gs network indicated incomplete lipopolysaccharide  biosynthesis. the pathways for keto-deoxyoctulosonate and lipid a synthesis and assembly were found, but the genes encoding the enzymes classically involved in heptose biosynthesis and in sugar incorporation onto the lipid a were missing. these observations suggest the occurrence of an unusual lps structure in m. extorquens am <dig>  consistently, no heptose or galactose was detected from the hydrolysis of cell material  though significant contents in rhamnose  and glucose  were found. the gs network also included the biosynthetic pathways for carotenoids and bacteriochlorophyll a. the biosynthetic pathway of bacteriochlorophyll was complete in addition with the presence of the enzymes of the photosystem i. several degradation pathways are missing in the gs network of m. extorquens, including the degradation of amino acids - e.g. histidine, arginine, tyrosine - and nucleotides. this is in agreement with physiological data showing that the occurrence of these compounds in the cultivation medium did not result in detectable metabolic activity.

the gs metabolic reconstruction showed that m. extorquens possesses a respiratory chain with alternative systems for electron inputs and outputs . a great variety of potential electron donors could be identified, including a significant number of soluble periplasmic dehydrogenases transferring electrons to cytochrome c, including methanol dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase, and the already-mentioned soluble sugar dehydrogenase. three terminal oxidases were also present, including two ubiquinol oxidases and one cytochrome c oxidase, suggesting that m. extorquens can adapt an aerobic metabolism to different oxygen levels. besides oxygen, nitrate might represent a potential alternative electron acceptor.

organization of central metabolic pathways
c <dig> assimilation ensures the conversion of the c1-unit into precursor metabolites and involves a high number of metabolic pathways like c <dig> pathways, serine cycle, emcp, tca cycle, gluconeogenesis, anaplerotic reactions . they are connected by overlapping metabolites and enzyme reactions. the most central processes are interconnected cycles  or pathways . the serine cycle shares common reactions with gluconeogenesis , with the emcp , with the tca cycle , and with amino acid metabolism . the emcp shares also reactions with the polyhydroxybutyrate  biosynthesis , the tca cycle , and fatty acid degradation  dehydratase, hydroxybutyryl-coa dehydrogenase). the overall picture of m. extorquens central metabolism that emerges from these observations is an unusual series of metabolic pathways and cycles that are tightly embedded one into each other and allow operating almost as an entity. the c <dig>  and c <dig>  intermediates play a critical role in the overall network organization. they represent the branching-points of the three main central metabolic pathways, i.e. the serine cycle, the emcp and the tca cycle, and of anaplerotic processes. hence, they can be generated by different metabolic routes  <cit> . accordingly, seven different reactions allow the inter-conversion of the five compounds . these reactions include processes inter-converting i) c <dig> into c <dig> , ii) c <dig> into c <dig> , iii) c <dig> into c <dig> ), and iv) c <dig> into c <dig> , malic enzyme). moreover, the c3/c <dig> inter-conversions include either reversible reactions  or irreversible but opposite reactions . the result is a dense sub-network of reactions that provides alternative pathways for the same conversion  <cit>  and the occurrence of potential substrate cycles  <cit> .

identification of the sub-network operating during methylotrophic growth
the functional structure of the metabolic network operating during pure methylotrophic growth conditions of m. extorquens, i.e. growth on methanol as sole source of carbon and energy, was established by determining the sub-network of the gs metabolic model that includes all the reactions operating on methanol, thereafter referred to as the 'methylotrophic network' . the identification of the methylotrophic and non-methylotrophic reactions was based on both theoretical and experimental considerations, including i) physiological parameters ii) genetic and biochemical data, iii) omics data , and extensive refinement. the reactions were confronted against all above criteria and were included or excluded a based on multi-criterion consideration and their overall score . this reduction step was also a pre-requisite for in silico analysis of the methylotrophic network. the size of the gs model was too big to apply elementary flux mode  analysis, a powerful tool to analyze the functional properties of metabolic networks from their topology  <cit> , due to computational limitation. the additional file  <dig> shows the diagram of the reduction process which was carried out in the following manner:

i) methylotrophic growth of m. extorquens
the determination of the methylotrophic network was performed here to account for conditions where m. extorquens cells were grown exponentially in a minimal medium containing methanol as the sole added source of carbon and energy, nh4cl as nitrogen source, and mineral salts, as described in material and methods. such growth conditions allowed three levels of reduction of the gs metabolic model. first, the processes  associated with the utilization of compounds  included in the gs network but not occurring in the medium were removed. similarly, the pathways and transport systems associated with metabolic end-products included in the gs network but not detected experimentally during methylotrophic growth were removed. quantitative 1h-nmr analysis of culture supernatants collected after methylotrophic growth indicated that very few by-products accumulated in the medium, and only at negligible levels, allowing the removal of  <dig> reactions from the gs model. it was also assumed that in exponentially-growing cells no biomass degradation occurred, resulting in a further simplification of the network by removing the biochemical pathways specifically involved in the degradation or salvage of macromolecular components. this simplification resulted in the removal of  <dig> biochemical reactions. some reactions associated with macromolecule degradation could be potentially involved in other metabolic processes, such as cofactor biosynthesis or recycling of anabolic by-products. some of these reactions - a total of  <dig> - appeared to be relevant for growth on methanol and were kept in the methylotrophic network.

ii) genetic and biochemical data
literature data were used to further substantiate the methylotrophic network. more particularly, the phenotypes of gene deletion mutants were used to support the reduction process. from currently available literature, a total of  <dig> genes were shown to be essential during growth on methanol. some of these genes encode multifunctional enzymes, so that a total of  <dig> biochemical reactions were associated with the  <dig> essential genes. all monofunctional enzymes  were kept in the methylotrophic model. for multifunctional enzymes, it could not be determined at this stage which reaction was  responsible for essentiality, and other considerations were applied before making a decision as regard to their inclusion or exclusion of the methylotrophic network. in total,  <dig> reactions were excluded from genetic data analysis.

the enzyme assays available in the literature were considered to confirm the presence of biochemical reactions during methylotrophic growth, as well as their differential activities upon non-methylotrophic condition. additional biochemical information from in vitro assay of particular reaction like spontaneous reaction or biochemical information in other microorganisms was used to validate reaction occurrence. in total,  <dig> reactions were excluded from biochemical data analysis.

iii) omics data
the next reduction step was based on the comparison of omics data - including transtriptomics  <cit> , proteomics  <cit> , and metabolomics data  <cit> , collected for both methylotrophic-grown and non-methylotrophic grown m. extorquens cells  <cit> . the molecular components corresponding to each type of omic data - e.g. protein for proteomics data - were kept in the methylotrophic network when they were identified to occur in methanol-grown cells, and/or their content was significantly higher - at least twice higher - than in non-methanol-grown cells, i.e. succinate-grown cells. the score of components identified from transcriptomics , proteomics  and metabolomics  were assigned to their corresponding biochemical reactions via the gpr association. taken together, the omics data were involved in the confirmation of the occurrence of  <dig> reactions, and the exclusion of  <dig> reactions. the final methylotrophic network contained  <dig> reactions and  <dig> metabolites, associated with  <dig> genes , and included approximately two thirds of the components of the gs network. to validate the topology of the methylotrophic network, non methylotrophic reactions were constrained to zero in the stoichiometric model of m. extorquens metabolism, and the reduced model was used to simulate growth performance on methanol. fba simulations showed that the network supports a theoretical maximal growth rate of  <dig>  h- <dig>  which is consistent with experimental values  <cit> . moreover, this value was close to the maximal growth rate calculated with the gs network , indicating that no significant growth capacities were lost during the reduction of the gs network and furthermore suggesting that about one-third of the total metabolic potential of the bacterium is not required for growth on methanol.

dissimilation capabilities of the methylotrophic network
the capability of methylotrophs to use methanol as sole energy and carbon source relies on the occurrence of both dissimilatory and assimilatory pathways, which fulfill all energetic and biosynthetic requirements, respectively. the reconstruction of the metabolic network of m. extorquens gave the opportunity to analyze the  organization of the two types of processes in this model methylotroph. elementary flux mode  analysis, a powerful tool to analyze the functionality of metabolic networks from their topology  <cit> , and fba simulations, were carried out. dissimilation and assimilation processes were first analyzed separately.

dissimilation processes were defined here as processes resulting in the net conversion of methanol into co <dig> and allowing energy conservation. the main dissimilation route is known to be the stepwise oxidation of methanol to co <dig> using dedicated c <dig> pathways  <cit> . this process involves the periplasmic oxidation of methanol into formaldehyde, which is further oxidized to co <dig> in the cytoplasm . in this process one cytochrome c and two nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide  h) are released, assuming the pyridine nucleotide dependent formate dehydrogenase  operates. this 'cytoplasmic' route can fulfill both adenosine triphosphate  and redox requirements at the same time. in case cytochrome c and nadh are reoxidized by the most effective oxidative phosphorylation mechanisms, a maximal yield of  <dig> atp/methanol is predicted . the additional potential routes for methanol dissimilation within the methylotrophic network could be detailed from the in silico investigations . a periplasmic route of formaldehyde oxidation can be predicted in case methanol-dehydrogenase-like enzyme xoxf would act together with a periplasmic formate dehydrogenase  <cit> . such a route would not generate nadh and hence could only fulfill atp requirements, albeit with reduced maximal yield . the network contains also other potential alternative mechanisms for the complete oxidation of methanol in which multi-carbon compounds are first generated and then completely oxidized to co <dig>  these processes would result from the combined action of c <dig> assimilation pathways  and of catabolic pathways where multi-carbon compounds are fully oxidized to co <dig> . the latter processes are the main energy conservation mechanisms upon utilization of c <dig> and other multi-carbon compounds, and are likely to be down-regulated during pure methylotrophic growth conditions. nevertheless, the in silico analysis shows that the methylotrophic network contains the potential for these indirect dissimilation routes. they are however not efficient for energy conservation  and are unlikely to operate upon methylotrophy from the energetic point of view.

assimilatory processes
the consequences of the particular organization of primary c <dig> assimilation in m. extorquens am <dig> were analyzed by examining the processes allowing the conversion of methanol into each of the  <dig> key carbon precursors, including c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , c <dig> , 3hbcoa), c <dig>  and c <dig> ). the number of efms ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> for the various carbon precursors . the serine cycle was involved in all assimilatory efms except for me-thf, which can be also generated directly in the c <dig> pathways. this observation was consistent with the key role of the serine cycle pathway in methanol assimilation. the emcp was involved in 93%, 95%, and 92% of the efms generating me-thf, acetyl-coa, and -3-hbcoa, respectively. for all other carbon precursors, including the serine cycle intermediate glycine and l-serine, all assimilatory efms required the emcp. these data emphasize the critical role of the emcp , in addition to the c <dig> pathways  and the serine cycle , in methanol assimilation. hence, the initial steps of c <dig> assimilation require the consecutive but obligatory operation of a high number of reactions. the minimal efm length, representing the smallest number of reactions needed to convert methanol into each carbon precursor, was calculated for each of the  <dig> carbon precursors. the conversion of methanol into c <dig> compounds required at least  <dig> reactions, and the minimal number of reactions required to convert methanol into e4p was  <dig>  even for me-thf and acetyl-coa, the minimal efm lengths were high . these data indicated that the primary assimilation processes, ensuring the conversion of methanol into carbon precursors, is a particularly complex process in m. extorquens am <dig>  despite the complexity of methanol assimilation, the carbon precursors are produced from methanol with carbon yields that are similar to that observed on glucose for species like e. coli and c. glutamicum.

interdependencies of dissimilatory and assimilatory processes
the energetic efficiency of dissimilation processes determines the amount of energy available for assimilation and hence is a critical parameter of methylotrophic growth. the complete set of efms  through the methylotrophic network was analyzed to investigate the relationships between dissimilation and assimilation processes. the efms were classified according to their biomass yields, and then to the various types of dissimilatory processes . in the efm with the optimal biomass yield , 70% of methanol was directly oxidized via c <dig> pathways and the remaining was used for assimilation purposes. in a significant number of assimilatory efms, methanol was entirely oxidized to co <dig> via the c <dig> pathways , meaning that no reduced carbon entered assimilatory pathways, and indicating that biomass could be fully generated from co <dig>  the highest biomass yield that could be obtained by such process was  <dig>  g · g- <dig> . in this efm, , carbon fixation is achieved by a process involving both the empc and the serine cycle. the process starts in the emcp where two glyoxylate molecules are generated from one acetyl-coa and two co <dig>  the two glyoxylate molecules enter the serine cycle to produce two glycine molecules. one glycine is converted by the glycine cleavage complex into one co <dig> and one me-thf. the latter compound allows the conversion of the second glycine molecule into serine, which is used in subsequent steps of the serine cycle, allowing both the regeneration of the initial acetyl-coa molecule and enabling - through the operation of the entire mechanism - the formation of all carbon precursors needed for biosynthetic purposes. the overall carbon balance is  <dig> co <dig> →  <dig> glyoxylate. as this process requires the release of me-thf via the glycine decarboxylase complex, it represents a distinct feature compared to the classical operation of the serine cycle. the carbon yield of the co2-assimilation process is significantly lower than observed for methanol assimilation . the atp needs are twice higher -1), and the redox needs are two to three times more elevated. such high energetic costs can be covered by methanol oxidation, but the overall co <dig> assimilation process is much less favorable than methanol assimilation. this co <dig> assimilation process was not reported so far and is a direct consequence of the capability of the emcp to ensure co <dig> fixation.

substitution of the ethylmalonyl-coa pathway by the glyoxylate cycle
the recently discovered emcp is an alternative to the classical glyoxylate cycle for the biosynthesis of glyoxylate from acetyl-coa in organisms lacking isocitrate lyase   <cit> . to compare the metabolic properties conferred by the emcp with that of the glyoxylate cycle, we generated a variant of the methylotrophic network lacking the emcp but possessing the glyoxylate cycle. this was done by setting to zero the flux from crotonyl-coa to propionyl-coa and by adding the icl reaction. malate synthase, the enzyme of the glyoxylate cycle that catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-coa and glyoxylate into malate, was not added since m. extorquens can use a combination of two enzymes to achieve the same reaction  <cit> , as described also in r. sphaeroids  <cit> . as expected, the glyoxylate cycle was essential for methanol growth and was found in all assimilatory efms. the maximal biomass yield predicted for the icl variant  was similar to that observed for the emcp variant yield . to obtain such maximal growth, the rate of methanol oxidation in the icl variant was smaller  and the nadph requirements lower than in the emcp variant, showing a higher energetic efficiency of the icl variant. in contrast to the emcp, the icl variant was not found to allow entire biomass formation from co <dig> 

to investigate the potential role of the emcp in redox balancing, we compared the capability of the two metabolic network variants to respond to varying nadph production levels. fba simulations were performed where the amount of nadph produced by the me-h4mpt dehydrogenase mtdb  <cit> , which can use either nadh or nadph, was varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  mmol · g- <dig> · h- <dig> . for both the emcp and icl variants, the absence of nadph production in the c <dig> pathways can be compensated by other nadph-production systems, the ppp or malic enzyme. the theoretical maximal growth rate increased with nadph production until a maximum is reached, which represents the optimal balance between nadph production and growth. maximal growth for the emcp variant was obtained at higher nadph production level than the icl variant , in agreement with the higher redox demand identified previously. the emcp variant was able to maintain higher growth rates when the nadph production was further increased. this capability was correlated with a significant increase of the emcp flux. the increase in the emcp flux was accompanied by the truncation of the serine cycle. rather than being converted to oaa, pep is converted into pyruvate via pyruvate kinase, which is further converted by pyruvate dehydrogenase into acetyl-coa, which enters the emcp. this pathway generates atp  and releases nadh , resulting in a transhydrogenase-like mechanism where the redox equivalents are transferred from nadph to nad+ in addition to the transfer to co <dig> 

fragility of the methylotrophic network
robustness is an inherent property of a metabolic network and is defined as the capability of this network to operate despite one - or more - reactions are removed. the robustness of the methylotrophic network was analysed using minimal cut sets , which correspond to minimal combinations - singlets, pairs, triplets, etc - of reactions whose removal blocks the operation of a target metabolic function  <cit> . the identification of all mcss in a metabolic network allows the calculations of the fragility coefficient  of each reaction. the fc of a reaction represents the probability that the metabolic system fails to achieve the target function when the reaction is removed. this approach was applied to analyze the robustness of the methylotrophic network using growth as the target metabolic function. a significant number of reactions  were found to have a fc of  <dig> and are therefore predicted to be essential . among these  <dig> reactions, 30% are catalyzed by multiple enzymes, indicating that enzyme redundancy is significantly used to avoid metabolic resilience in m. extorquens am <dig>  most of the essential reactions  were found in biosynthetic pathways, which is consistent with studies performed with other organisms. the fcs of reactions found in central metabolism spanned over a wide range of values but distributed heterogeneously among metabolic pathways . some processes, such as the c1- and carbohydrate pathways, and c3/c <dig> interconversion reactions, had low fcs and hence were predicted to be robust parts of the metabolism. most other parts of the central metabolism had high fcs and hence were predicted to be fragile. of the  <dig> reactions of the central carbon metabolism,  <dig> were found to be essential. the essential reactions concentrated in the primary assimilation processes . most reactions of the serine cycle  and of the emcp  were predicted to be essential for methylotrophic growth, indicating the assimilation processes to be highly fragile. the same observation holds true for gluconeogenesis. because a particular reaction can be catalyzed by one or several enzymes, the essentiality of a reaction does not necessarily mean that the removal - by gene deletion - of one particular enzyme will be lethal. among the  <dig> essential reactions found in central pathways,  <dig> were catalyzed by a single enzyme. accordingly,  <dig> of these genes have been studied experimentally, and 95% of them were shown to be lethal for methylotrophic growth  <cit>  . for an essential reaction with multiple enzymes, one isoenzyme can compensate the lack of the other one. genes encoding isoenzymes are therefore predicted to be not essential. however, mutant analysis showed that  <dig> out of  <dig> essential reactions with multiple enzymes found in primary assimilation processes, were encoded by gene where deletion were lethal for growth on methanol. this observation suggests that the products of these genes play an essential role during growth on methanol that cannot be compensated by the other potential enzymes catalysing the same reactions, or that they have different regulations, or both. taken together, these data showed that the main processes of methanol assimilation are highly fragile in m. extorquens am <dig>  the robustness of the metabolism of m. extorquens am <dig> was also calculated for a c <dig> compound , and for a c <dig> compound . the data were compared to that calculated for e. coli using the model of klamt et al.  <cit> . the utilization of c <dig> compounds like acetate relies on the emc pathway in m. extorquens and on the glyoxylate cycle in e. coli. interestingly, the metabolic robustness of the central metabolism upon acetate growth was calculated to be lower in the former organism compared to the latter. upon growth on succinate, which does not rely on c1-associated pathways but on common pathways  that are similar in the two organisms, metabolic robustness was calculated to be similar between the two organisms. these observations suggest that metabolic fragility in m. extorquens is mainly related to the nature and organization of c <dig>  pathways in this organism.

distribution of metabolic fluxes during methylotrophic growth
the distribution of metabolic fluxes during methylotrophic growth was determined using 13c-metabolic flux analysis . 13c-mfa was already successfully applied to m. extorquens am <dig>  which provided valuable insights into the operation of central pathways  <cit> . the novel insights such as the operation of the emcp  <cit> , the organization of central assimilatory pathways  <cit> , and the biomass composition  necessitates the reinvestigation of metabolic flux analysis in m. extorquens am <dig> during growth on methanol. to this end, a series of 13c-methanol labeling experiments was performed, and the isotopic information was monitored by both mass spectrometry and two dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance   <cit>  . such analytical combination provides critical information for the resolution of central pathways  <cit> . the flux distribution obtained from these investigations is displayed in figure  <dig> and listed in additional file  <dig>  and the fitting accuracy and sensitivity analysis are listed in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the flux data obtained in the present were significantly different from that previously published  <cit> . this is mainly due to the major advances made in the meantime in the description and understanding of m. extorquens metabolism, and it is now known that the size and topology - and hence the possible carbon flows - of central carbon metabolism are more complete and much different than previously assumed. for this reason they can be hardly compared.

the flux data of figure  <dig> indicated that  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mmol · g- <dig> · h- <dig> of methanol, 84% of methanol consumed , was directly oxidized to co <dig> within the c <dig> pathways. a release of co <dig> was also observed within biosynthetic pathways  and central metabolism . the release of co <dig> in central metabolism was due to substantial fluxes through malic enzyme  and pepck , but was not associated with dissimilation processes. indeed, the tca contributed to only  <dig> % of total co <dig> release and operated in an incomplete and anabolic mode. the flux of c <dig> assimilation via me-thf was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mmol · g- <dig> · h- <dig>  which represents 16% of methanol uptake. the flux data clearly showed the central role of the serine cycle in distributing the carbon flow throughout the entire metabolic network to fulfill the requirements in carbon precursors. about 20%  was directed towards gluconeogenesis and carbohydrate pathways, and 30% was routed to the formation of pyruvate and tca cycle intermediates. the release of acetyl-coa by the serine cycle was significant . the major part  was recycled back to the serine cycle by the emcp, and the remaining was used for anabolic purposes. the fixation of co <dig> occurring within central pathways was calculated from the difference between co2-utilizing and co2-releasing fluxes, and was  <dig>  mmol · g- <dig> · h- <dig>  this value was similar to the rate of methanol assimilation via me-thf . these data were consistent with the observation that 50% of the biomass carbon derived from co <dig>  <cit> . such carbon balance can be obtained in case two molecules of glyoxylate are generated per turn of the emcp  <cit> , which requires that the propionyl-coa produced in this pathway is not directly used for anabolic purposes but converted into glyoxylate. accordingly, the replenishment of the glyoxylate pool from propionyl-coa was almost identical to the direct release of glyoxylate within the emcp . no flux was found through the glycine cleavage complex, indicating that the co <dig> assimilation mechanism identified from efm analysis was not operating during pure methylotrophy, for chosen cultivation conditions. surprisingly, a glycolytic flux through the entner-doudoroff pathway was observed. this flux  was low compared to the rate of formate assimilation but was significant to fit the labeling data and represented about 14% of total pyruvate synthesis. this observation indicated that some carbon atoms were recycled through gluconeogenesis and glycolysis during methylotrophic growth.

the flux data provided valuable information regarding the c3/c <dig> pathways. the synthesis of pyruvate, which is required for various anabolic purposes, was proposed earlier to proceed via the conversion of pep into pyruvate, via pyruvate kinase  <cit> . the flux data showed that pyruvate was synthesized by three different routes, including pyruvate kinase, the ed pathway and malic enzyme. the main flux was carried out by malic enzyme . moreover pep synthase, which catalyses the reaction opposite to pyruvate kinase, is active and its flux  is higher than that of the latter enzyme. this observation indicated the occurrence of a substrate cycle between pep and pyruvate due to the parallel activity of pyruvate kinase and pep synthase, and in which 68% of pyruvate is recycled. three additional substrate cycles were observed in this part of the metabolism. two of them were related to c3/c <dig> inter-conversions: i) pep/oaa cycling via pepcl and pepck , and ii) pep/malate/pyruvate cycling via pepcl, malate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme and pep synthase . the fourth substrate cycle was observed between malate and . it relies on the reversible activity of the malyl-coa lyase  <cit>  and on the parallel operation of malate-coa ligase and malyl-coa thioesterase. malate-coa ligase is responsible for the release of glyoxylate and acetyl-coa from malyl-coa in the serine cycle. malyl-coa thioesterase catalyzes the opposite reaction. this enzyme is supposed to play a key role during growth on multicarbon compounds, but its activity is not expected during methylotrophic growth. indeed, the enzyme activity is down regulated during growth in the presence of methanol  <cit> . however, a significant activity of this enzyme is still detected upon methanol growth  <cit> , and represents 22% of the activity found on acetate. such level of activity is likely to be sufficient to maintain a flux in the reaction, thereby resulting in substrate cycling. the flux data show not only that the latter cycle operates in m. extorquens am <dig> during growth on methanol, but also that the extent of recycling is significant . the energetic cost of metabolite recycling within the four above-mentioned processes was calculated from the flux data to be  <dig>  mmol atp · g- <dig> · h- <dig>  with the most expensive one  being the malate/ cycle. the energetic cost was calculated to represent about 4% of the total production of atp . this energetic expense might represent a tradeoff between optimal metabolic efficiency and the ability to switch metabolic modes.

the total demand in nadph during methylotrophic growth could be calculated from the fluxes in nadph-utilizing reactions and biomass requirements, and was  <dig>  mmol · g- <dig> · h- <dig>  the demand was mainly due for formate assimilation , biosynthetic requirements , and operation of the emcp . the 13c-flux data showed also that the two nadph-forming reactions found within central carbon pathways, i.e. isocitrate dehydrogenase and g6p dehydrogenase, contributed only negligibly  to the total nadph production. hence, most of nadph is generated alongside formaldehyde oxidation. from these data it can be calculated that the production of nadph in the c <dig> pathway should be  <dig>  mmol · g- <dig> · h- <dig> to close the nadp balance. to evaluate the atp balance, flux variability analysis and fba simulations were performed in which the methylotrophic network was constrained with the 13c-flux data, biomass requirements, experimental rates of growth and methanol uptake, and maintenance energy. because the respiratory mechanisms by which the reduced cofactors  generated in the c <dig> pathways are not clearly established in m. extorquens the atp cannot be firmly established from the flux data. nevertheless, the simulations showed that, if dissimilation proceeds via the cytoplasmic, nadh-dependent route at maximal atp efficiency , then the total production of atp  would be in large excess compared to the requirements .

discussion
the genome scale metabolic network reconstructed in this work offers an integrated view of the current metabolic knowledge of the methylotrophic bacterium m. extorquens am <dig>  it provides new insights into the biochemistry of this organism and reveals the network-scale organization of metabolic processes as well as a first evaluation of the complete metabolic potential of this bacterium. the metabolic reconstruction allowed a detailed picture of the central carbon metabolism of the bacterium, which appears as a mosaic of common  and specific  pathways, enabling growth on c <dig> and multicarbon  compounds. the core of the central metabolism is organized as a highly unusual series of tightly embedded metabolic cycles that operate as an entity to achieve c <dig> assimilation during methylotrophic growth. the ability to assimilate c <dig> compounds relies on a complex metabolic machinery, in which the initial steps - from methanol to biomass precursors - require a particularly high number of reactions . the entire process is strongly reductive and energy-consuming. most of these reactions require enzymes and cofactors that are specific to c <dig> - or c <dig> - growth, and must be biosynthesized for the purpose of c <dig> or c <dig> utilization. hence, the energetic costs for the biosynthesis and maintenance of this machinery are likely to be substantial for the bacteria. in addition, the network-scale analysis reveals that c <dig> assimilation is structurally fragile. similarly to other metabolically specialized microorganisms  <cit> , the core metabolism of m. extorquens is characterized by a high fraction of reactions that are essential for methylotrophic growth . in such networks robustness arise usually from enzyme  redundancy, where multiple isoenzymes can catalyze essential reactions  <cit> . the genetic or biochemical deficiency in one isoenzyme can be compensated by another one. accordingly, the percentage of multiple genes encoding essential reactions in specialized microorganisms is much higher than in generalist - or flexible - organisms such as e. coli, b. subtilis or s. cerevisiae   <cit> . the high degree of redundancy  observed in m. extorquens confirms the specialized metabolism of this methylotroph. furthermore, among the essential reactions with multiple genes, a significant number of particular genes were shown experimentally to be essential for growth on methanol, suggesting that the alternative gene have different functions or regulations, hence are not functionally redundant. therefore, the number of genes essential for methylotrophy is high, and the risk that a gene mutation results in loss of methylotrophic capacity is elevated. this could explain, in part, the successes in the identification of such genes in the last  <dig> decades  <cit> . the observations emerging from metabolic network analysis are highly consistent with experimental evolution experiments in which a significant number of clones collected after prolonged cultivation  on succinate lost their methylotrophic capacity  <cit> . taken together, available data suggest that a selection pressure is required to maintain methylotrophy in m. extorquens, indicating that the bacterium encounters frequently methanol in its natural environment and that its usage provides critical advantage in terms of ecological competitiveness.

the metabolic reconstruction data indicate also that a dense network of c3/c <dig> inter-conversions plays a critical role as a branch-point connecting specific and common pathways. indeed, seven reactions interconnect three c <dig>  and two c <dig>  intermediates, thereby strongly embedding the serine cycle, the tca cycle, anaplerotic processes, and gluconeogenesis . such topology allows a wide range of alternative metabolic routes and provides metabolic flexibility. van dien et al.  <cit>  have emphasized the role of these processes in the metabolism of multi-carbon compounds. during growth on c <dig> compounds such as succinate, a functional tca cycle is required and the generation of acetyl-coa is ensured by pyruvate dehydrogenase. hence, the conversion of c <dig> compounds into pyruvate is critical and can be achieved by redundant routes. during methylotrophic growth - in which a complete tca does not operate -, the c3/c <dig> inter-conversions primarily ensure the opposite conversion of c <dig> intermediates into c <dig> intermediates in the serine cycle. they provide also alternative metabolic routes for such conversions, as observed with the significant conversion of pep into pyruvate via pepcl, malate dehydrogenase, and malic enzyme, though the role of this pathway is still unclear. the most striking feature is, however, the occurrence of substantial substrate cycling within the c3/c <dig> inter-conversions upon growth on methanol. in addition, substrate cycling was also observed between c <dig>  and c <dig> , at the branch-point between the serine cycle, the tca cycle, the emcp and anaplerosis. substrate cycles are resulting from the simultaneous operation of - non reversible - opposite reactions or processes, at the expense of energy. they can represent adaptation mechanisms allowing fast switching of metabolic processes  <cit> . the nature of the substrates cycles observed predicted during methylotrophic growth indicated that the entire set of reactions starting from pep or pyruvate to acetyl-coa and glyoxylate are operating as a fully reversible process. as mentioned above, these processes are the branching-point of the specific - i.e. serine cycle, emcp - and common - i.e. tca cycle, anaplerotic processes, and gluconeogenesis - pathways. they are also the starting point of a large number of biosynthetic routes, and the entry point of the utilization pathways of all c <dig>  c <dig> and c3/c <dig> carbon sources used by the bacterium. taken together, these data suggest that upon pure methylotrophic growth the occurrence of substrate cycling provides flexibility between specific and common pathways, thereby allowing fast switching of the metabolism from methanol to alternative carbon substrates.

though m. extorquens am <dig> is considered to be a methylotroph but not an autotroph, the in silico investigations revealed a potential of autotrophy in this bacterium, which relies on the unique property of the emcp to enable co <dig> fixation. the co2-fixation mode involves a cyclic operation of both the emcp and serine cycle to generate one glyoxylate from two co <dig>  it can potentially operate independently of methanol assimilation in m. extorquens, but was not observed during methylotrophic growth in our investigations. because the genome of m. extorquens contains the complete information for a photosynthetic machinery, it is tempting to speculate that this bacterium may operate in a photoautotrophic mode. however, there is currently no experimental evidence of such behavior in m. extorquens. the question of the role, benefit and conservation of this pathway in m. extorquens and other organisms is still unclear. the emcp is more complex and energy-demanding than the glyoxylate cycle though it provides a higher carbon balance for assimilation. in photosynthetic methanol utilizers, carbon dioxide functions as an electron sink for the excess electrons in methanol  <cit> . it was recently proposed that co <dig> fixation could represent an alternative mechanism of cofactor recycling in bacteria  <cit> . the potential role of the emcp in such mechanism was recently shown from investigations of cbb mutants defective for the reductive ppp pathway in acetate-grown r. sphaeroides  <cit> . our investigations show that the emcp can potentially play such a role in m. extorquens upon methylotrophic growth. if further investigations are required to determine the actual physiological benefits of the emcp in serine cycle methylotrophs, our investigations show that this pathway can potentially play the role of a redox-balancing mechanism or of an autotrophic pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
the unusual organization of the central carbon metabolism of m. extorquens am <dig> allows efficient utilization of c <dig> compounds via highly specific - and fragile - pathways but is versatile enough around a flexible backbone of c2/c3/c <dig> inter-conversions to allow switching to other carbon sources. these observations showed that the bacterium maintains active metabolic processes that are not needed for methanol utilization but allow adaptation to other carbon sources. this hypothesis is consistent with the observation that methanol is produced by plant with methanol release in the morning  <cit> . this work emphasizes that the metabolism of the bacterium is adapted to its lifestyle not only in terms of enzymatic equipment, but also in terms of network-level structure and regulation. it suggests that the metabolism of the bacterium is adapted both structurally and functionally to an efficient but transitory utilization of methanol. this work illustrates that the combination of gs network modeling and experimental approaches provides novel insights into the biochemistry and physiology of methylotrophic bacteria, which could be extended to obligate methylotrophs and to the comparison of serine cycle versus rump- and cbb-utilizing methylotrophs. methanol is currently regarded as a highly attractive raw material for microbial bioprocesses  <cit> . comprehensive, system-level understanding of methylotrophic metabolism is also expected to improve the biotechnological value of methylotrophy, and this knowledge will serve as a sound basis for a rational remodeling of existing biosynthesis routes and for the design of new synthetic pathways  <cit> .
