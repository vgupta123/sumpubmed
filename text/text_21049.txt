BACKGROUND
dna replication is a well-organized process confined to the s phase of cell division cycle. it is initiated at a number of loci called replication origins. during g <dig> phase, pre-replication complex  is formed at replication origins with the binding of origin-recognition complex  and initiation factors  <cit> . in the s phase, dna replication can be activated from these sites with assistance of protein kinases cdk and ddk. dna replication origins of different eukaryotes may have different properties. in budding yeast, orc binds to the 11-bp conserved autonomously replicating sequences  to initiate the dna synthesis  <cit> . in other eukaryotes, consensus sequence is not found and the mechanisms of regulating the function of origins may be determined by other components embedded in the complex genome. an example is fission yeast, which lacks conserved consensus sequence for orc binding and replication origins are found at a+t rich islands  <cit> . current understanding of dna replication process suggests that dna replication in each cell is stochastic  <cit>  and there may be much more dormant origins than actually used  <cit> . during a specified cell cycle, origins may undergo two kinds of replications: they either initiate replication , or are replicated by the replication forks initiated from neighboring origins . the firing efficiency of a specific origin is determined as the percentage of cell cycles that it functions actively to initiate replication, i.e., frequency of active replication. different origins may have different firing efficiencies. some origins fire in nearly every cell cycle, and some may seldom fire. measuring origin firing efficiency is important to understand the mechanisms underlying dna replication. several methods have been developed to measure and estimate firing efficiencies of dna replication origins. in  <cit> , shirahige et al measured ars' activity from budding yeast in extrachromosomal plasmids through the analysis of mitotic stability. their results show that these sequences can initiate replication with very high efficiency  when they are removed from chromosome and incorporated in plasmid. however, when these sequences remained intact in the original chromosomal context, some of them may not fire at all. the firing efficiencies of these potential origins range from very high to very low. in  <cit> , replication origins on chromosome vi of s.cerevisiae were studied using 2-d gel electrophoresis. the firing efficiencies of these origins are estimated as the difference of the fraction of replication forks between leaving and entering the origins by studying replication patterns of the dna fragments immediately flanking the origin. their estimation of firing efficiencies of  <dig> replication origins on chromosome vi ranges from less than 10% to more than 85%, with average efficiency of around  <dig> %. yamashita et al  <cit>  validated the above results by using the same technique , but different estimation methods. they estimate firing efficiency by measuring the ratio of the density of bubble arc  and simple-y arc . the average firing efficiency they estimated ranges from  <dig> % to  <dig> % for different strains of yeast. besides the estimation of origin firing efficiencies of budding yeast, origin firing efficiencies of fission yeast were also determined. patel et al investigated firing efficiencies of  <dig> fission yeast origins by using single molecule technique called dna combing  <cit> . this technique visualizes stretches of dna molecules on a glass surface by fluorescence microscopy. the firing efficiencies of origins are determined as the percentage of dna fragments that contained a bubble within the region of the origin. these techniques work well for small number of origins, but are limited by their incapacity to measure all origins efficiently. recent genome-wide study of dna replication approximate origin firing efficiency by indirectly measuring dna enrichment in hydroxyurea  experiment  <cit> . due to the effect of hu, replication forks were stalled at the locations near the firing origins. hence, signal ratios in the hu experiment may reflect how efficiently the origins are used. when origin usage is efficient, signal ratio should be high; while if the origin is seldom used, the signal ratio would be low. the average efficiency of the firing origins in s.pombe mitotic s-phase was estimated to be around 29%. this method provides an approximation to the estimation of firing efficiency, however, as the effect of hu prevents interactions of origins, this method may not reflect properties of firing origins in vivo and may lead to inappropriate estimations.

as previous methods either lack the ability to measure all origins or are prone to inaccurately approximate origin firing efficiencies, we are seeking a genome-wide analysis method to characterize origins' activities. in this paper, we present a probabilistic model, spanned firing time model , to estimate locations and firing efficiencies of all origins along the whole genome. different from previous methods, this new method is based on the genome-wide analysis and modeling of dna replication process. previous researches demonstrate that dna replication at a specific locus shows a variability of replication timing in a synchronized cell culture. this variation of replication time was observed in quantitative hybridization experiments  <cit>  as well as microarray studies  <cit>  which show the copy number change at each locus along the progress in s phase. in  <cit> , replication at a given locus on the genome is modeled to start at t <dig>  and ends at t <dig> . the averagereplicationtime or half completion time is t <dig> = / <dig> and the replication span is denoted as dt = t <dig> - t <dig> as shown in figure  <dig> . the replication timing profile which reflects the temporal program of replication can be obtained by joining individual replication time  at different loci alongthe genome . in the proposed sftm, this temporal program of replication as well as the temporal properties of firing origins are characterized and modeled. by fitting sftm to the experimental time-course s-phase copy number variation data of dna replication, we could effectively characterize all firing origins. the estimated firing efficiencies are in good consistency with previous measurements using dna combing and 2d gel analysis. this research provides a new analytical model to characterize the properties of dna replication process and a new method to predict origins as well as their firing efficiencies.

methods
probabilistic model of dna replication process
eukaryotic chromosomes contain multiple replication origins, the activity of which is different in different cells. for the efficient origins, they are utilized in nearly every cell cycle; however, the inefficient origins fire only in a fraction of cell cycles. therefore, the dna at a given locus may be replicated by different origins in different cell cycles. if the increase of dna content at a given locus is viewed as a stochastic event in an ensemble of cell cycles, the probability of dna replication at a given locus is a function of the probability of initiation of replication by the adjacent origins. for microarray experiments, the measured dna content change at a given locus k at time t can be interpreted as the proportion of cells in the cell culture that have already replicated at this locus by time t, i.e., probability of replication of locus k by time t and represented as a cumulative distribution p{yk ≤ t}. suppose the dna at locus k can be replicated by the fork emanating from one of the m origins and denote the event of dna replication at locus k replicated by origin i before time t as {xik ≤ t} , the probability of the dna replication p is determined by the following equation:   

which means that the probability of locus k replicates before time t is the probability of at least one of the m replication forks emanating from origin i  and passing locus k before time t. the probability of each individual origin i replicating locus k be denoted as:   

where constant fi is the potential firing probability of the origin i and pik  is a function of time t and reflects the probability of replication forks emanating from origin i  and passing locus k before time t.

spanned firing time model
based on the above mathematical description of dna replication process and temporal flexibility of origin firing observed in the literature, we propose a spanned firing time model  with the following properties:

 <dig>  a given origin oi can stochastically fire within a window  with uniform probability, i.e., pii  ~ u  where tsi is firing starting time and tei is firing ending time. u  is a function of t' and defined as:   

 <dig>  each origin can potentially fire with full efficiency 100%.

 <dig>  a potential origin will propagate replication if it fires before any replication fork arrives at it. if a replication fork reaches before the origin fires, then initiation will be suppressed and the site of the origin will simply undergo passive replication, which causes the observed origin firing efficiency less than  <dig> 

this model reflects our current understanding of dna replication processes. for example, in s.cerevisiae, the well-defined autonomously replicating sequence  elements can fire as frequently as 90% outside chromosome in plasmid  <cit> ; however, at their native locations within chromosome, certain ars elements may not fire or show little origin activity. studies also show that silent replication origins can be activated if the passive replication by the adjacent origins is prevented  <cit>  or if replication forks are slowed down  <cit> . this phenomenon is modeled in the proposed sftm as that each origin has the full potential to fire  and the passive replication by the replication forks from neighboring origins leads to the incapacity of some origins to fire and hence observed firing efficiency less than  <dig> 

based on the properties of sftm, the probability of replication fork emanating from origin i and passing locus k before time t is:   

where tsi is firing starting time of origin i, tei is firing ending time of origin i, dik is the distance between origin i and locus k, v is replication fork moving velocity and  represents the time for a replication fork to travel from origin i to locus k.

estimation of firing efficiency
a basic observation of sftm is that for locus k, the replication initiation and completion time t <dig> and t <dig>  <cit>  must satisfy the following equations:      

this means that for the cells observed in a synchronous cell culture, the dna at locus k starts to replicate at the time when the earliest replication fork emanating from all possible origins arrives, and it finishes replication  before or at the time when the first of all possible latest replication forks passes by. equations  and  apply to origins as well. the dna at an origin can be actively replicated by itself, or passively replicated by the adjacent origins. thereby, the firing time of an origin relative to the replication forks' arriving timing determines its pattern of replication and firing efficiency as well.

suppose that there are n replication forks arriving at a given origin k before t <dig> , that is, this origin k can be potentially replicated by a total of n origins . by ordering of the first arriving time of these forks as shown in figure  <dig>  where t <dig> = t <dig> , tn = t <dig>  and , we could see that origin k can initiate active replication only during the time interval   and under the condition that there is no replication forks passing by before origin k fires. the probability of the initiation of active replication by origin k  in  is then the firing efficiency, which could be calculated according to:   

where Δtj = tej - tsj is the firing interval of origin j. this formula distinguishes between active replication and passive replication. it reflects that origin firing efficiency is a result of interactions between neighboring origins.

an illustrated example
if o <dig> can only fire very late after  <dig>  min within the timing window  instead of  in the above example, it will never actively initiate any dna replication since the replication fork originating from o <dig> will arrive at this position  within the timing window of . in this case, firing efficiency of o <dig> is 100%, while o <dig> is a dormant origin with firing efficiency 0%. if replication fork moving rate is reduced to  <dig>  kbps/min, the replication fork from o <dig> will arrive at position of o <dig> within the timing window  . therefore, delayed arrival of replication fork allows for more probability for origin o <dig> to fire, thus increasing the firing efficiency of origin o <dig> to  <dig> % according to eq. . if the replication fork moving velocity is further reduced to  <dig>  kbps/min, the replication fork from origin o <dig> will arrive at position  <dig> kbps within the timing window  . as a result, the efficiency of original dormant/inefficient origin o <dig> will increase greatly to 100%. thus firing efficiency is determined by the firing time window of the interplaying origins, fork replication velocity and relative distance between origins. by incorporating these parameters into sftm, we could estimate the efficiencies of all origins.

algorithm
procedure to estimate origins as well as their firing efficiency based on sftm can be implemented in  <dig> steps as follows.

 <dig>  data normalization: time-course microarray data is first normalized to change from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

 <dig>  estimate fork velocity: the t <dig> replication timing profile is first obtained as described in  <cit> . the fork moving velocity is then determined using the method in  <cit> . it is calculated as the ratio of the total distance between the peak and flanking valleys in t <dig> replication profile to the total time difference between t50s at the peak and at the valleys.

 <dig>  fit sftm model: spanned firing time model needs to estimate the number of origins m as well as the location and firing window of each origin. that is, from the time-course microarray experimental data sets, we need to estimate the origin list Θ = {|i =  <dig> ..., m}, where m is the number of origins, li is location of the ith origin, tsi is firing starting time of the ith origin and tei is firing ending time of the ith origin. as the precise number of origins is unknown, it is better to investigate the results obtained from all possible number of origins. therefore, we start from a range of possible number of origins. this range is roughly estimated from previous studies, for example, a range of 5% to 15% of all available loci for data set pom-heichinger. for each possible number of origin m in this range, we search for the parameters that minimize the sum of squared error  between the measured dna content change from microarray experiment and those estimated from our model at all time points and loci. the sse minimizer is implemented using simulated annealing search  <cit> . for each search, firing efficiency of each origin is calculated and those origins whose firing efficiency is  <dig> are discarded.

 <dig>  calculate regional efficiency: a regional firing efficiency within a sliding window along the chromosome is calculated for each search. regional firing efficiency instead of point efficiency is preferred due to the noise and limited resolution of microarray data, variation of the length of dna replication origin and the inaccurate estimation of the number of origins and so on. this regional firing efficiency is calculated as the probability of active replication of all origins within a window . the regional firing efficiency estimates are less variable between different starting points used by the algorithm . therefore, the calculated regional firing efficiency is averaged over all the searches. the peaks of the averaged regional firing efficiency curve with height greater than  <dig>  are then identified and locations where these peaks occur are origins. the firing starting time ts and ending time te of the origin represented as the peaks are calculated as the median of ts and te of the found origins at this region identified in all searches.

a brief description of the implementation procedure to obtain the solution of the model parameters is shown in appendix.

RESULTS
simulation study
to test the performance of the proposed algorithm, we have simulated a dna replication data for a hypothetical chromosome of length  <dig> kbps with nine origins firing in different timing windows as shown in figure  <dig>  dna content change at different times at  <dig> kbps,  <dig> kbps,...,  <dig> kbps,  <dig> kbps are generated. gaussian noise n is then added to the generated time-course data. the estimated t <dig> timing profileof the generated data is shown as the blue line in figure  <dig>  traditional methods estimated the locations of origins from t <dig> timing profile. however, traditional methods  have difficulty in obtaining the correct estimation of some origins such as origins at  <dig> kbps and  <dig> kbps. different from the traditional method, the proposed method estimates the locations of origins from the regional firing efficiency curve as shown in figure  <dig> . the hardly detected origins  exhibit a clear peak on the regional firing efficiency curve. the small peak at site of  <dig> kb is a false peak, whose height is less than  <dig> , and thus it is excluded from the predicted origins. the results show that the proposed method is more powerful at detecting the locations of origins. figure  <dig> compares the locations and temporal parameters  of firing origins estimated from the proposed model with the true values used to generate the simulated data. the precise prediction of locations of origins and very low error of the estimation of ts , te and firing efficiency demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

estimation of locations of dna replication origins
the validity of the proposed sftm model is further tested on the available time-course microarray data of dna replication on both yeasts - s.pombe  <cit>  and s. cerevisiae  <cit> . the brief description and abbreviation of the data sets used is shown in table  <dig>  the full list of predicted origins is available in additional file  <dig>  we first compare the locations of origins predicted by sftm with the previous studies. in previous studies, peaks of the average replication timing profile  would reflect location of origins of replication. whereas, the proposed sftm estimates locations of origins based on a different scheme: the origin should have a detectable firing efficiency . table  <dig> displays a comparison of the estimated locations of origins by sftm and previous studies. it is clearly seen that the proposed sftm method could effectively find the origins of replication. the obtained results are in good consistency with previous studies using different methods. the average overlapping rate  between the results from sftm method and previous studies is  <dig> %. the origins identified by sftm or previous method  are also compared to the origins identified by non-replication methods in s.cerevisiae  <cit>  and at richness method in s.pombe  <cit> . the number of overlapping origins and origins identified uniquely by one method is displayed in additional file 1: figure s <dig> and s <dig>  compared to the previous method, sftm performs better as the origins detected are more overlapped with those identified by non-replication method or at richness method. besides that, the proposed sftm method is more sensitive by detecting more origins which are not identified by non-replication method or at richness method. those origins identified only by sftm show relatively lower firing efficiencies  and s3). this suggests that sftm can detect not only strong replication origins but also the weak ones. table  <dig> compares the estimated locations of origins by sftm method applied to different time-course microarray data. the estimations are in good match with each other and this validates the efficacy of the proposed sftm method in detecting locations of replication origins.

this table shows the extent of the match between locations of potential origins estimated by sftm and previous studies. each item in column  <dig> and  <dig> contains two parts: the representation of the method/paper used to detect the origins and the number of origins detected. column  <dig> is the results from proposed sftm method applied to the time-course microarray data as shown in table  <dig>  column  <dig> is the results obtained from previous studies by raghuraman et al   <cit> , alvino et al   <cit> , heichinger et al   <cit>  and feng et al   <cit> . column  <dig> displays the number of origins in common within  <dig> kbp distance estimated by the methods in column  <dig> and  <dig>  the average distance of the origins in common are displayed in column  <dig> 

this table shows the extent of the match between locations of potential origins estimated by sftm applied to different time-course data as shown in table  <dig>  the meaning of the items in each column is the same as that shown in table  <dig> 

estimation of firing efficiency of origins
s.cerevisiae
we first compared the firing efficiencies estimated by sftm applied to the microarray time-course data about dna replication  with previous quantitative measurements of firing efficiency by using 2-d gel electrophoresis on chromosome vi of s.cerevisiae  <cit> . figure  <dig> and  <dig> show a comparison between these estimations. as shown in figure  <dig>  our two estimations correlate well with the previous 2-d gel electrophoresis studies. the pearson correlation coefficients between these three estimations are respectively  <dig>   for 2d-gel vs cer-raghuraman-sftm;  <dig>   for 2d-gel vs cer-alvino-sftm and  <dig>   for cer-alvino-sftm vs cer-raghuraman-sftm. these fairly good correlations between our estimation and previous studies indicate the capacity of the proposed sftm method to estimate firing efficiencies of origins. next, a comparison is carried out on the estimated firing efficiencies from all  <dig> chromosomes of s.cerevisiae from data sets cer-raghuraman and cer-alvino. figure  <dig> demonstrates the comparison between results obtained from these two data sets. each point represents one of  <dig> co-localized origins predicted from these two data sets . from this figure, we could see that the estimations from these two independent microarray data sets are correlated well with each other and the pearson correlation coefficient is  <dig>  .

s.pombe
in  <cit> , patel et al estimated the firing efficiencies of selected origins on chromosome iii of fission yeast. in this part, we first compare our estimation by applying sftm to the pom-heichinger data set with those estimated by patel et al. figure  <dig> shows a comparison of efficiencies of  <dig> origins estimated by both methods. the correlation coefficient between these two estimations is  <dig>  . this result validates the efficacy of the proposed method in estimating firing efficiencies of origins.

next, we compared our estimation of the origin firing efficiencies with those estimated by measuring the signal ratios in the hu experiment from heichinger et al  <cit> . these two estimations are well correlated with each other and the correlation coefficient is around  <dig>   as shown in figure  <dig>  figure  <dig> compares the estimated firing efficiencies of matched origins by applying the proposed sftm model to the two microarray datasets: pom-heichinger and pom-eshaghi. the two estimations are correlated with each other but not strongly correlated . this may be due to the different synchronization methods used in these two experiments. in pom-heichinger, the cell culture is synchronized using temperature-sensitive cdc25- <dig> mutant at the entry of g <dig> phase; while in pom-eshaghi, synchronization using hydroxyurea  at the beginning of s phase is obtained. in addition, the origin interaction is not taken into account in heichinger et al's analysis  <cit> . the origin efficiency in heichinger et al's analysis is estimated from dna enrichment ratio in the hu experiment. as hu will inhibit the fork migration away from origins, the origin interaction is actually not taken into account in their analysis. however, in our model, the origin interaction is the key to explain and estimate origins' firing efficiency. figure  <dig> demonstrates comparison results obtained from the two repeats in pom-eshaghi. the correlation between these two repeats is  <dig> .

the above results obtained from s.cerevisiae and s.pombe microarray experimental data are in good consistency with previous studies which estimate origins firing efficiencies by using dna combing technique or 2-d gel electrophoresis. besides that, results obtained by applying the proposed sftm to the microarray data sets from different labs also demonstrate a good correlation. from these results, we conclude that the proposed sftm is a reliable and valid method to estimate origin firing efficiency .

distributions of origin firing efficiency
firing efficiency and replication/firing time
finally, we investigated the properties of parameters related to dna replication process in sftm. figure  <dig> shows the corresponding correlation between origin firing efficiency and origin firing starting/ending times, origin replication initiation/completion times and so on. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  ts and te are negatively correlated with firing efficiency, which means that if an origin starts to fire early, it is efficient and if it finishes firing early, it is efficient. this is because that an origin may have more chance to actively initiate the replication if it can start/end firing early. however, if the firing window  of an origin is relatively late compared to other origins, the late firing time of this origin may render the replication fork emanating from neighboring origins more time to travel to this location and replicate it. thus, this origin would be inefficient since it is less likely for this origin to initiate the replication actively. another observation from figure  <dig> is that average replication time  is highly negatively correlated with firing efficiency and hence it is reasonable to approximate firing efficiency by only calculating the average replication time . previous studies  <cit>  traditionally classify origin to be strong/weak  based on whether it is early/late replicated. the negative correlation between firing efficiency and average replication time validates this classification and approximation. it is also seen from figure  <dig> that the replication span  is negatively correlated with firing efficiency in s.cerevisiae and positively correlated with firing efficiency in s.pombe. the replication span is used to describe replication efficiency of a locus   <cit> . the negative correlation in s.cerevisiae means that s.cerevisiae has replication efficient and firing efficient origins. to be specific, if an origin can initiate the active replication more frequently in cell cycle , it may take shorter time for this origin to finish the replication . whereas, in s.pombe, it may take longer time for the firing efficient origins to complete the replication  because of the positive correlation between firing efficiency and replication span. this means that s.pombe has either replication efficient or firing efficient origins but not both. these results demonstrate that the relationship between firing efficiency and replication span  depends on the context and the organism.

the above observation from sftm can also explain the discrepancy about "origin efficiency" reported in previous studies. in  <cit> , heichinger et al observed a negative correlation between origin efficiency and replication time; while eshaghi et al observed a positive correlation between origin efficiency and replication time. this discrepancy comes from different definitions of origin efficiency. in heichinger et al's paper, origin efficiency is defined as the frequency of origin usage in the cell population or cell cycles. therefore, an efficient origin would fire in most cell cycles, i.e. fire efficiently. the negative correlation observed between firing efficiency and average replication time as shown in figure  <dig> agrees with heichinger's results that origin efficiency is negatively correlated with replication time and the early origins tend to be more efficient than late ones. whereas, eshaghi et al approximated origin efficiency by how fast an origin replicates, i.e. replication rate or replication efficiency (). higher replication efficiency means shorter replication span dt. based on sftm, a positive correlation between t <dig> and  is observed.

thus, the same conclusion is reached in our and eshaghi et al's research that the late origins have higher replication rate  in order to complete the dna replication in time. by distinguishing the two 'origin efficiency' in previous research as 'firing efficiency'  and 'replication efficiency' (), we successfully solved the discrepancies incured in  <cit>  and  <cit> .

next, we explored the factors which may regulate firing efficiency ). in s.cerevisiae, ars consensus sequence  is the motif of the binding site for replication initiator protein. we first calculated the correlation between the strength of acs motif  <cit>  and the firing efficiency of origins. as shown in figure  <dig>  no significant correlation is found between acs strength and firing efficiency. however, the consistent positive value may suggest the weak positive influence of acs strength on firing efficiency. next, we examined the correlation between histone occupancy and firing efficiency. the histone occupancy data is obtained from  <cit> . the negative and significant correlation  demonstrates that origins located in regions with lower histone occupancy have higher firing efficiency compared to origins with higher histone occupancy. this may be due to the easy accessibility to replication proteins at the regions with lower histone occupancy. at last, we studied the relation between origin firing efficiency and at richness in s.pombe. as demonstrated in figure  <dig>  a significant and positive correlation is observed . this positive correlation demonstrates that the regions with higher at content are generally firing efficient compared to regions with lower at content.

origin efficiency estimation on human chromosome  <dig> and 22
the proposed sftm model is also applied to the human dna replication data sets  <cit>  to determine locations and firing efficiencies of the origins. figure  <dig> shows the results averaged across three available repeats  <cit> . the regional firing efficiency is calculated based on a region window of  <dig> kbp. the peaks of regional firing efficiency curve provide the information about locations and firing efficiencies of origins. the average firing efficiencies are respectively  <dig> % and  <dig> % for chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  an observation from figure  <dig> is that firing efficiency shows a domain effect. in some domains, such as the region from  <dig> to  <dig> mbps on chromosome  <dig>  the distances between origins are large and firing efficiencies for them are also high. in other domains, such as the region from  <dig> to  <dig> mbps on chromosome  <dig>  the distances between origins are small and many relatively inefficient origins exist. if average firing efficiency at each domain is calculated, the variation of average firing efficiency is small which demonstrates that each domain is at the same level of firing efficiency in order to complete the dna replication in time.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we developed a new probabilistic model - spanned firing time model  for dna replication. the proposed sftm model reflects constrained stochastic properties in dna replication. a key feature in sftm is that each origin has two characteristic times: firing starting time ts and firing ending time te , which determine the span of the firing window as well as the relatively early/late firing. the random firing of origins within the firing window will make different cells undergo different replication program, and hence "stochasticity" in dna replication. the difference of the firing span length and firing starting time may cause the population average displaying a temporal program with some regions replicating early and some regions replicating late.

based on the proposed sftm model, we could estimate origins' firing efficiencies at genome-wide scale from time-course s-phase dna copy number variation data. our results obtained from both s.cerevisiae and s.pombe demonstrate that the predicted origins and their efficiencies are in good consistency with previous studies as well as among themselves. these results reveal that the proposed model is appropriate to characterize the properties of dna replication process and estimate the origin usage in the cell populations. the proposed sftm model is also applied to human dna replication data on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> as the spanned firing of origins should reflect a general phenomenon of dna replication process and is not confined to the yeasts.

the proposed sftm model can estimate the locations as well as the firing efficiencies of origins at genomic scale. compared to the conventional genome-wide methods which detect locations of origins from t <dig> temporal profile, sftm is more sensitive to detect weak origins as shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig> and s <dig>  a point needs to be noted is that our estimation of firing efficiencies is based on the genome-wide time-course data. for the analysis of an individual origin, the experimental methods will be more accurate in estimating the firing efficiency. therefore, the proposed method is not meant to replace direct firing efficiency measurement methods  for accuracy, but instead provides an efficient alternative way to estimate the firing efficiency of origins at genomic scale, though at reduced accuracy. as current microarray time-course s-phase dna copy number variation data suffers from limited temporal and spatial resolution, the accuracy of the proposed method in estimating origins' locations and efficiencies are affected from these limitations. we can imagine that a sufficient sampling rate on densely probed time-course data will significantly improve the accuracy of our estimates. in addition, as an improvement of the proposed model, the underlying assumptions will be examined in our future work. for example, the assumption of uniform distribution of origin firing timing within a time window may be improved by a possible empirical distribution. moreover, a good estimation of the replication fork moving velocity is also important for the accuracy of our estimations. the current method estimated the fork moving velocity from the slope of the t <dig> curve. this is a first-order approximation to the fork velocity, as it does not consider the contribution of different fork moving directions to the shape of t <dig> curve. this can be improved in our future work by investigating the dynamics of replication fork progression. the stochastic properties of dna replication process is summarized and reflected by the parameters  in our proposed model. in our future work, the relation between the molecular factors  and these summarized temporal parameters will be investigated. we hope that our results will be useful for the further analysis of the stochastic yet robust program of dna replication process.
