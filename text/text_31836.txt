BACKGROUND
light energy is converted to chemical energy during photosynthesis. however, because excess light is harmful, plants engage several protective mechanisms, including non-photochemical quenching  of chlorophyll  fluorescence. npq is subdivided into three components that involve relaxation kinetics under darkness followed by a period of illumination. the first component, qe, relaxes quickly  and is triggered by an increase in the trans-thylakoid proton gradient, or Δph. the second component, qt, relaxes more slowly and is a state transition phenomenon. the last component, qi, with the slowest relaxation, is a rather ill-defined component which traditionally includes a non-relaxing component related to irreversible damage, such as the inactivation of d <dig> protein in the photosystem  ii reaction center  <cit> . recently, the third very slow component, qz was proposed, which depends on zeaxanthin  <cit> . zeaxanthin directly or indirectly contributes to all npq mechanisms except qt  <cit> .

the major component, qe, is dependent on three factors: the Δph  <cit> , pigments in the xanthophyll cycle  <cit> , and a 22-kda psii protein called psbs  <cit> . these control qe in an integrated manner. although the signal largely disappears when one factor is absent, qe can still be induced in the absence of psbs, albeit much more slowly  <cit> . the qe signal is characterized by several activities, e.g., light-induced absorbance changes at 535 nm  <cit> , shortening of a specific chl fluorescence lifetime component from ~ <dig>  to ~ <dig>  ns  <cit> , formation of carotenoid cation radicals  <cit> , or changes in the configuration of neoxanthin molecules in the light-harvesting complex  ii  <cit> . alterations in absorbance and the chl fluorescence lifetime often reflect structural changes in pigment-protein complexes of the thylakoid membranes.

the role of the psbs protein in qe was first described in npq4- <dig> mutants of arabidopsis thaliana that lack psbs  <cit> . although this protein is evidently necessary for qe, arabidopsis mutants completely lacking psbs show normal photochemistry without any visible phenotype under controlled-environment conditions of non-fluctuating light  <cit> . however, when grown in the field or under rapidly fluctuating moderate light in a laboratory, those mutants produce fewer seeds than wild-type plants  <cit>  and also show retarded growth  <cit> . the function of psbs in qe development remains unclear, and the role of protonation of its glutamate residues in chl fluorescence quenching is still debated  <cit> . two thylakoid lumen-exposed glutamate residues of psbs sense shifts in ph  <cit>  and induce conformational changes that control qe  <cit> . psbs does not seem to bind pigments  <cit>  but may either interact with cp <dig>  <cit>  or induce conformational modifications in it that modulate the energy of the chl/zeaxanthin charge-transfer state  <cit> . recent data have provided information on how psbs controls the conformation and organization of psii supercomplexes  <cit> . recently have been shown that psbs controls over photosynthesis in fluctuating light which optimize the photoprotective processes  <cit> .

when npq is inhibited, one might expect more reactive oxygen species  to be produced in the chloroplasts. powerful ros include the highly reactive singlet oxygen  <cit> , the superoxide anion radical, and hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . biotic- and abiotic-stress conditions lead to an imbalance between ros generation and scavenging; those accumulated ros can cause damage to cells near the sites where they are generated  <cit> . even though ros are scavenged by diverse antioxidative defense substances , ros levels may rise rapidly following environmental changes  <cit> . due to their highly reactive nature, ros react with a wide range of molecules in biological organisms and can damage these molecules with consequences that may be fatal to the cell or even the plant  <cit> .

the main source of ros in chloroplasts is the electron transport chain; the generation site for each ros depends upon the stress applied  <cit> . singlet oxygen is a byproduct of photosynthesis, mainly formed at psii  <cit>  but also in other locations where triplet chl molecules are produced. generally, three different sites within the photosynthetic apparatus are associated with singlet oxygen production: i) the psii reaction center; ii) the antennae of the lhc, and iii) the psi acceptor site  <cit> . the destructive effect of singlet oxygen on d <dig> protein within the psii reaction center is well understood  <cit> . however, little is known about how singlet oxygen influences other components of the thylakoid membrane. the singlet oxygen produced in flu mutants of arabidopsis strongly affects atp synthase activity and causes changes in npq, although its production site differs from those mentioned above  <cit> . the water–water cycle is considered the main source for superoxide production on the reducing side of psi, helping plants to dissipate excess light energy by increasing the rate of electron transport and lowering the luminal ph  <cit> . generation of superoxide within psii has also been reported  <cit> . the next site for superoxide production is the plastoquinone pool  <cit> . there, superoxide is rapidly dismutated to the more stable hydrogen peroxide by superoxide dismutase   <cit> . if superoxide is produced within the thylakoid membrane  <cit>  where sod is absent, hydrogen peroxide can be produced by the reduction of superoxide by plastohydroquinone pqh <dig>  <cit> , and the same pathway also occurs within mitochondrial membrane  <cit> .

to elucidate the role of psbs protein in the photoprotective mechanism of npq, we investigated the consequences of eliminating this protein, especially on the generation of ros. we found that superoxide produced at psii was greater in psbs-knockout rice leaves than in the wild type leaves. however, the levels of superoxide produced at psi did not differ between the mutants and wild-type plants. therefore, we suggest that psbs protects against superoxide production at psii when excess energy is absorbed by the psii antennae.

RESULTS
isolation of a rice psbs knockout plant and generation of psbs rnai transgenic plants
the rice genome has two psbs genes -- ospsbs <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> and ospsbs <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . ospsbs <dig> and ospsbs <dig> encode proteins of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively. arabidopsis psbs  shares 68% sequence similarity with ospsbs <dig> and 71% with ospsbs2; the two rice proteins show 72% overall amino acid identity with each other.

we selected psbs-ko, a putative knockout mutant for ospsbs <dig>  from a pool of t-dna insertion rice lines. it had been generated by transformation with a t-dna vector  containing a promoterless gus gene next to the left border  of the t-dna  <cit> . sequencing via inverse-pcr of the region flanking that insertion  <cit>  revealed that the t-dna was inserted in the 3rd exon of ospsbs <dig> . by genotyping multiple segregating lines in the t <dig> generation, we selected four plants homozygous for the t-dna insertion. the result of the genotyping of psbs <dig> line is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  western blotting with a psbs-specific antibody from agrisera indicated that all four of the homozygous mutant plants lacked psbs . in those plants, the npq value that developed within 5 min was approximately  <dig>  , which is similar to that reported for the arabidopsis npq4- <dig> mutant  <cit> . a more detailed analysis of npq relaxation  indicated that qe was completely lacking in psbs-ko leaves.figure  <dig>

a ko mutant plant for ospsbs <dig> was also chosen from the pool of t-dna insertion lines. its flanking sequence revealed that the t-dna was inserted in the sole exon near its start codon . this rice gene product shares very high sequence similarity with atpsbs, and exposure of etiolated seedlings to red and blue light induces a several-fold increase in the steady-state level of ospsbs <dig> transcripts  <cit> . nevertheless, this rice mutant exhibited no visible phenotypic deviations with respect to the wild type, and their npq levels were also very similar. no ospsbs <dig> product was found in ospsbs <dig> knockout mutant plants when two different psbs-antibodies were used, suggesting that such a product could not be detected by these antibodies. this was probably because either the immunological characteristics of ospsbs and the arabidopsis protein differ from that of the ospsbs <dig> gene product or else the protein encoded by ospsbs <dig> does not accumulate in the chloroplasts. these data are also consistent with previous genetic evidence that ospsbs <dig>  but not ospsbs <dig>  is co-localized with a qtl for npq  <cit> . thus, our subsequent characterization focused solely on ospsbs <dig>  which we refer to as ospsbs hereafter.

to confirm that the reduced npq of psbs-ko leaves was caused by the insertion in ospsbs <dig> and not by either the insertion of multiple t-dnas or other genetic differences, we used rna interference  technology to generate transgenic rice with significantly reduced psbs protein levels. plants were transformed with an rnai construct that contained an inverted repeat of a unique 102-bp region of ospsbs <dig>  with a portion of the pbsiiks vector serving as a linker and driven by the ubiquitin i promoter . transformants were screened by rt-pcr for ospsbs <dig> transcripts  and confirmed by western blotting . from these, we identified three rnai lines with varying ospsbs <dig> transcript and psbs protein levels. among them, line # <dig> produced little or no psbs. its npq development level  and its corresponding light curve  were comparable to those found from the psbs-ko line. however, electron transport rates were similar between all investigated samples and their wild type counterparts .

lack of psbs protein in rice plants results in increased sensitivity to photoinhibitory illumination
at the whole-plant level, an arabidopsis mutant  lacking the psii protein psbs has no visible phenotype except for reduced fitness when grown under either oscillating light or in the field  <cit> . we also observed that the growth rates of psbs-ko and psbs-rnai rice plants under fluctuating light were significantly reduced , and that grain yield from psbs-ko plants was only about 30% of that reported from the wild type  <cit> . under strong illumination , npq4- <dig> becomes more susceptible to photoinhibition than wild-type plants  <cit> . when we exposed leaf segments to photoinhibitory illumination , values calculated for fv/fm in the rice psbs-ko mutant and rnai plants dropped very rapidly, to about 40% of the level for dark-adapted controls . by contrast, the fv/fm in the wild type was reduced to about 55% of the dark-adapted control. in all plant types, this decline was largely completed within 1 h of treatment, and no further decrease was observed thereafter . the initial decline in fv/fm probably resulted because photodamage to psii occurred more rapidly than it could be repaired. moreover, the significant reduction in this rate of decline after 1 h was due to activation of the psii recovery process  <cit> . the initial rates of photodamage were apparently higher in both psbs-ko and rnai leaves than in the wild type; however, recovery seemed to be activated in a similar manner regardless of genotype .figure  <dig>

photoinhibition is a complex process entailing photodamage, repair of d <dig> protein of psii, and re-assembly of active psii  <cit> . leaf infiltration with lincomycin, an inhibitor of protein synthesis in the chloroplasts, allows one to assess this process in isolation. here, when lincomycin was applied, the rates of photodamage in both psbs-ko and psbs-rnai leaves were higher than in the treated wild type. blockage of the recovery process meant that the fv/fm for all three plant types continued to decrease until it reached ~10% of the dark-adapted value. this demonstrated that psbs-ko and psbs-rnai leaves are more susceptible to psii photodamage.

to monitor how leaf segments recovered in the absence of lincomycin after photoinhibition, we measured changes in fv/fm after 2 h of exposure to dim light  at room temperature. the illumination used in this experiment resulted in ~40% and ~50% reductions in the fv/fm values of psbs-ko and wild-type leaves, respectively. after a 2-h recovery period, fv/fm of the psbs-ko, psbs-rnai, and wild type reached 82%, 84% and 90% of their dark-adapted values, respectively . this indicated that the recovery process, including repair and re-assembly, is normal in psbs-ko and psbs-rnai leaves.

superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production is higher in psbs-deficient rice leaves
singlet oxygen is a photosynthesis byproduct that is mainly formed at psii under high-light conditions  <cit> . because our data indicated that psbs-ko and psbs-rnai rice has increased susceptibility to photoinhibition, we measured singlet oxygen production in wild type, psbs-ko, and psbs-rnai leaves using singlet oxygen sensor green  which specifically detects singlet oxygen  <cit> . here, its fluorescence emission in wild-type plants increased almost four times by photoinhibitory illumination, and the increase of the sosg fluorescence emission in psbs-ko or psbs-rnai leaves was not significantly different from that in wild type . we could get very similar results using dansyl- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> -tetramethyl- <dig>  5-dihydro1h-pyrrole  .figure  <dig>

because high light-induced production of singlet oxygen was no higher in plants lacking psbs than in the wild type, we measured the levels of other ros, including superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. we visualized generation of the former by histochemically staining of rice leaves with nitroblue tetrazolium  . in dark-adapted samples, no difference was observed among all genotypes, but both psbs-ko and psbs-rnai leaves were stained dark-blue at  <dig>  μmol photons m−2 s− <dig>  even under moderate light intensity , more superoxide was accumulated in both psbs-ko and psbs-rnai leaves than in the wild type.

superoxide is rapidly dismutated to more stable hydrogen peroxide by sod  <cit> . therefore, we measured hydrogen peroxide production in wild type, psbs-ko and psbs-rnai leaves by histochemically staining with  <dig>  3′-diaminobenzidine  . under photoinhibitory illumination at  <dig>  μmol photons m−2 s− <dig> for 2 h, more hydrogen peroxide was detected in both psbs-ko and psbs-rnai leaves than in the wild type.

to confirm this result, we visualized the production of singlet oxygen, superoxide, and hydrogen peroxide at high resolution, using a confocal laser scanning microscope with danepy, dihydroethidium , and 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate , respectively , and the results were virtually the same as those observed by histochemical staining.

superoxide production is the initial event
to confirm the results obtained using leaf segments, we then determined the levels of three ros in isolated thylakoids before and after illumination with 700 μmol photons m−2 s− <dig> for 10 min. although sosg fluorescence emission increased by illumination, no significant differences in singlet oxygen generation were found between psbs-ko and wild-type plants . for more accurate detection of superoxide, we monitored increases in the fluorescence of dhe because it has been proven to detect superoxide in both intact cells and isolated subcellular fractions  <cit> . the suitability of dhe for assaying superoxide has also been verified by demonstrating that its fluorescence increases dose-dependently  <cit> . in the case of superoxide, the fluorescence emission at 615 nm rose linearly for 10 min, and the rate of increase was almost 40% as high in psbs-ko thylakoids as in the wild type . for hydrogen peroxide, the dcfda fluorescence in thylakoids increased more rapidly in the psbs-ko thylakoids . however, production of hydrogen peroxide began  <dig> to 3 min after the start of superoxide generation. this suggested that most of the hydrogen peroxide resulted from the conversion of superoxide, thereby indicating that the main ros overproduced in psbs-ko plants is superoxide rather than hydrogen peroxide. in addition, the results obtained by using fluorescence sensors were confirmed by measuring the levels of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide based on nbt absorbance at 560 nm and dab absorbance at 450 nm, respectively .figure  <dig>

superoxide produced at psii is more in psbs-ko rice leaves than in wild-type leaves
under stress, superoxide is believed to be produced mostly in psi  <cit> . in that case, psi in psbs-ko rice plants should be more damaged during photoinhibitory illumination where superoxide generated more than in wild-type plants. upon photoinhibitory illumination, the decrease in p700+ formation in psbs-ko was no greater than in the wild type  <cit> , even though more superoxide was generated in the former. the increase in dhe fluorescence from psii particles illuminated for 10 min was higher in psbs-ko leaves .figure  <dig>

these results were again confirmed by measuring changes in nbt absorbance at 560 nm, using psi and psii particles separated along a sucrose gradient  <cit> . as shown in figures 5b,c, superoxide production in psii particles was higher in psbs-ko than in wild-type plants, whereas production in psi complexes was similar for both genotypes. because superoxide production was greater in psii particles, we have compared protein composition of the psi and psii proteins using western blotting . although bby particles show contamination with psi proteins, their amount do not differ significantly to affect superoxide production. we also measured psi- and psii-driven superoxide production in thylakoids using corresponding donor-acceptor pairs. as expected, psii-driven production was higher in psbs-ko . surprisingly, psi-driven production was lower in psbs-ko thylakoids . these results were verified by measuring changes in nbt absorbance at 560 nm. when we instead used nadp+ as an electron acceptor, whole chain-driven superoxide production was again higher in psbs-ko thylakoids . however, psi-driven production was lower in those thylakoids . presumably, this decrease was a consequence of the activation of cyclic electron flow around psi in the psbs-ko plants  <cit> .figure  <dig>

to make sure that the differences in superoxide production are not due the differences in electron transport rates, we measured electron transport rates in all samples by a clark-type electrode . as expected, we observed no striking differences in rates between wild-type and psbs-ko thylakoids. moreover, isolated psi and psii samples showed similar rates. despite the differences noted in fv/fm between wild type and psbs-ko leaves after photoinhibitory illumination for 2 h , we could not observe such differences between the electron transport rates of two plants during illumination . in fact, we could also not observe such differences between the two plants during illumination of isolated thylakoids with 700 μmol photons m−2 s− <dig> for 10 min. in both thylakoids, the decrease in fv/fm was 40% of the initial value. taken together, our data suggested that, in the absence of qe, excess energy is released to molecular oxygen via an electron transport reaction. the observed phenotype in psbs-ko leaves was probably a consequence of increased superoxide generation in psii.table  <dig>

superoxide can be produced at different sites within psii, such as through cyclic electron flow with the participation of cytochrome b <dig>  <cit>  or at the qa site  <cit> . therefore, we measured the redox state of cytochrome b <dig> in mn-depleted psii complexes as well as the re-oxidation of qa− in wild-type and psbs-ko leaves. no significant differences between genotypes were found in the redox difference spectra for the high-potential form of cytochrome b <dig> in mn-depleted psii complexes . however, we observed a difference in qa− re-oxidation kinetics, measured as chl fluorescence decay, after a single turnover flash in the wild-type and psbs-ko thylakoids .figure  <dig>

discussion
in this study, we used biophysical, biochemical, physiological, and molecular biological approaches to characterize rice plants lacking the psbs protein at psii. our objective was to elucidate the role of psbs in the photoprotective mechanism of the qe component of npq. we confirmed previous conclusions that psbs-deficient plants lack energy-dependent quenching  <cit> . furthermore, we demonstrated that i) under high-light stress, psbs-deficient plants produce more superoxide, followed by greater generation of hydrogen peroxide but not singlet oxygen; ii) their psii  centers are more sensitive to photooxidative stress under constant illumination; and iii) more superoxide is produced by psii in psbs-ko plants compared with the wild type, probably occurring at the qa site. because the functions of psbs are likely to be similar in rice and arabidopsis, we believe that our data offer new insights into the role of psbs and the qe type of npq.

although qe is a major photoprotective mechanism of the photosynthetic apparatus in higher plants; its absence can affect the photochemical efficiency of psii. however, this effect seems to be negligible under constant light conditions in rice, as is true in arabidopsis  <cit> . nevertheless, under fluctuating light, psbs-deficient rice plants show growth retardation at the seedling stage  and reduced fitness at the reproductive stage  <cit> , which is similar to that reported with arabidopsis  <cit> . these reductions are likely caused by an increase in oxidative stress in plants lacking psbs, even though the ros species that may underlie this effect have remained unknown.

the triple knock-out mutant of the moss, physcomitrella patens,  lacking npq has a far higher triplet chlorophyll steady-state level than wild type  <cit>  suggesting that the level of the singlet oxygen also should be higher in the absence of npq. however, in the early stage of photoinhibition, when singly reduced qa is reversibly stabilized, the triplet chlorophyll is rapidly quenched by the interaction with qa−, preventing formation of harmful singlet oxygen  <cit> . we assume that our experimental condition is similar to this case. in our experiment, in the early stage of photoinhibition we do not expect more damage to the mutants  and consequently, our result is acceptable showing that the level of singlet oxygen was not significantly more in the psbs mutant lines compared with wild type.

singlet oxygen, which has been implied to inhibit d <dig> protein synthesis  <cit> , does not accumulate in plants lacking qe. in contrast, hydrogen peroxide, which also can influence the d <dig> repair system  <cit> , damages cells under photoinhibitory illumination and may cause oxidative bursts leading to cell death. here, hydrogen peroxide as well as superoxide produced more in rice that lacked qe. to determine accurate levels of ros in leaf tissues both in vivo and in vitro, one should apply a variety of methods and take multiple measurements  <cit> . here, we used assay systems based on several fluorescent dyes and other ros sensors. in the case of superoxide, all data obtained using nbt were confirmed using dhe because nbt acts as an electron acceptor for psii ). from our perspective, it was acceptable to employ nbt for in vitro assays because electron transfer to nbt will be minimal in the presence of artificial electron acceptors. because superoxide can be converted to hydrogen peroxide even without sod enzymes, we might explain the increase in hydrogen peroxide by an initial rise in the production of superoxide. although we cannot rule out the possibility that synthesis of hydrogen peroxide is also elevated in rice leaves lacking qe, our data  are much better explained if superoxide production is the initial event that eventually leads to the formation of hydrogen peroxide. similar data were reported in a parallel study with arabidopsis  <cit> . there, fluorescence sensors were used in the thylakoids, and epr spin-trapping with 4-pyridyl-1-oxide-n-tert-butylnitrone was tested in intact leaves, in order to detect the hydroxyl radicals that are produced from hydrogen peroxide/superoxide. furthermore, in the presence of 20 μm nigericin , the signals were similar between the wild type and npq <dig>  indicating that increased ros production was due to a lack of qe.

the main site of superoxide generation in thylakoids under high-light conditions is thought to be psi  <cit> . however, several researchers have also demonstrated light-induced generation of superoxide in psii  <cit> . instead, we showed that, when psbs-ko and wild-type plants were analyzed, leaves from the former produced more superoxide. in our comparison between the two plant sources, we found that more superoxide was produced only in psii, not in psi. moreover, we found that psi does not seem to incur more photodamage in treated plants, and we also observed superoxide production in psii particles. in fact, the proof of the mehler reaction mainly referred with data from algae, and it remains much more controversial for higher plants because of the deficiency of proof of the mehler reaction in higher plants. badger et al.  <cit>  reviewed a number of studies with higher plants, algae and cyanobacteria that have attempted to quantify o <dig> fluxes under various conditions and their contributions to the energy dissipation. the authors conclude that the mehler reaction is unlikely to support a significant flow of electron transport in c <dig> and crassulacean acid metabolism plants . thus they questioned the mehler reaction as a significant source of ros in higher plants  <cit> . this uncertainty was fully justified by driever and baker  <cit>  who could not detect any evidence for significant light driven mehler reaction at ambient co <dig> levels in two plant species. in addition, the data presented in this study on the lack of increase in ros production from psi centres would be consistent with this view that not much mehler reaction occurs in higher plants in vivo. cytochrome b <dig> may also be involved in superoxide generation in psii, based on reports that superoxide can be detected by epr spectroscopic analysis of psii particles isolated from a cytochrome b <dig> mutant of tobacco  <cit> . the detection of superoxide in isolated thylakoids by a voltammetric method suggests that when the photosynthetic electron transport chain becomes over-reduced, superoxide may be generated at the qa site of psii  <cit> . altering the qa− re-oxidation kinetics  suggests that the qa site of psii, rather than cyclic electron flow involving cytochrome b <dig>  is the superoxide generation site in psii. another reason for the involvement of qa in psii in higher superoxide production in psbs mutant is probably the shift of redox-potential of qa to a more negative value due to the lack of psbs, similar to the a249s mutant of thermosynechococcus elongatus  <cit> , which can make qa− to be able to reduce the molecular oxygen. because in normal conditions the redox-potential of qa/qa− is − <dig> mv  <cit>  while the redox-potential of o2/superoxide is − <dig> mv  <cit> . because psbs controls the conformation and organization of psii supercomplexes  <cit> , it is reasonable to predict more superoxide production at psii in psbs-ko leaves than in the wild type. it is likely that superoxide production at psii has received little attention because it is so rapidly converted to hydrogen peroxide and because psbs-dependent light dissipation provides such an efficient system of protection. in psbs-deficient plants this protection, which may be an important component of the role of qe in vivo, is compromised, facilitating detection of superoxide release.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrate that the psbs-deficient rice plants to compensate for their lack of qe appear to develop other mechanisms for releasing excess energy to molecular oxygen; those protective systems may be initially triggered by superoxide production in psii. studies in arabidopsis have shown that these systems may also provide broader protection against other sources of stress. when grown in the field, plants lacking psbs induce a metabolic and transcriptomic shift that activates defense response pathways  <cit> , resulting in an increase in resistance against biotic stress  <cit> . whether this response influences the susceptibility of rice mutants lacking psbs, as it does in arabidopsis, remains to be established. it is an open question whether one can enhance crop yields by manipulating npq levels  <cit> . however, the intricate interplay between costs and benefits for npq has apparently not resulted in the selection of plants with “maximal” levels of npq. potential positive effects of photooxidative processes  <cit>  may be one factor favoring plants with less capacity for npq and could help to achieve food security for the growing human population using less available resources  <cit> . we hope that future studies will provide a deeper understanding of why regulation of photosynthetic light harvesting has been so elegantly organized.
