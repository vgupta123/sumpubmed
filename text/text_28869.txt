BACKGROUND
methane is a potent greenhouse gas that has been implicated in global warming  <cit> . enteric fermentation of ruminant livestock is the largest source of anthropogenic methane, contributing between  <dig> and 25% of global methane emissions  <cit> . during ruminal fermentation, methanogenic archaea use hydrogen to reduce carbon dioxide or methylated compounds to methane, contributing to global methane emissions and representing a loss of between  <dig> and 12% ingested feed energy for the ruminant  <cit> . australian macropod marsupials such as kangaroos and wallabies exhibit foregut fermentation analogous to ruminants but resulting in lower methane emissions  <cit> , which suggests either lower hydrogen production from foregut fermentation or the functioning of alternative hydrogen disposal mechanisms to methanogenesis in these animals. if the latter, understanding hydrogenotrophy in these foregut systems may provide insight into mechanisms for redirecting hydrogen away from methanogenesis in ruminants. acetogenesis  may represent a significant hydrogen sink in the foregut of native australian marsupials and these animals may be a source of novel acetogens  <cit> . recent molecular analyses revealed a diverse and novel population of putative acetogens in the forestomach of the tammar wallaby that was significantly different to the population present in ruminants  <cit> . potentially, acetogen population differences between native australian marsupials and ruminants is causal or results from reduced methane emissions from foregut fermentation in these animals. the aims of the present study were to investigate the novel acetogen diversity from the tammar wallaby forestomach using enrichment cultures and molecular analysis of enrichment cultures, as well as to isolate acetogens from the tammar wallaby forestomach and investigate factors that may stimulate their hydrogenotrophic capacities. we report here the isolation of a novel acetogen, isolate twa <dig> from the tammar wallaby forestomach and its hydrogenotrophic capacity, mixotrophic growth capabilities and interactions with a methanogen in co-culture under autotrophic and heterotrophic growth conditions. we also report on partial genomic information from isolate twa <dig> relating to the wood-ljungdahl pathway genes and to genes for glycerol metabolism.

RESULTS
characterisation of tammar wallaby forestomach acetogen enrichment cultures hydrogen consumption and acetate production
acetogen enrichment cultures from tammar wallaby forestomach contents consumed net hydrogen and carbon dioxide. acetic acid was the major end product detected, a small amount of sulphide and minor amounts of other acids were also produced and no methane was detected . acetate production accounted for 61 ±  <dig> % of hydrogen consumed based on stoichiometry of the acetyl-coa pathway .

molecular analysis of tammar wallaby forestomach acetogen enrichment cultures
the 16s rrna gene  library  from tammar wallaby forestomach acetogen enrichment cultures revealed a restricted bacterial diversity  and rarefaction analysis indicated that an acceptable level of sequencing coverage had been achieved . one otu from the cultures showed > 97% rrs identity to enterococcus faecium, another contained sequences that demonstrated > 97% rrs identity to recently isolated kangaroo acetogens ye <dig>  ye <dig> and ye <dig> that are yet to be formally classified  <cit>  and the remaining otus were classified as clostridiales or tenericutes sequences and did not demonstrate > 97% sequence identity to any named species. the rrs from an isolate later obtained from the cultures  clustered within the otu demonstrating > 97% identity to kangaroo acetogens .

fthfs sequences  from tammar wallaby forestomach enrichments clustered into four otus that affiliated with the clostridiaceae and demonstrated homoacetogen similarity  scores > 90% . rarefaction analysis indicated that an acceptable level of coverage had been achieved for fthfs sequences . sequences in one fthfs otu  were the same as a sequence detected in the tammar wallaby previously  <cit> . the two largest fthfs otus from the enrichments grouped with two copies of fthfs recovered from isolate twa <dig>  which was later isolated from the cultures . acs sequences  from the enrichment cultures also clustered into four otus, one identical to an acs from blautia hydrogenotrophica and detected in the tammar wallaby previously  <cit> , the others affiliating with the lachnospiraceae or forming a sister group to the clostridiaceae. sequences in the two largest acs otus from the enrichments were identical to two acs sequences recovered from isolate twa <dig>  later isolated from these enrichments ; one of these sequences had been reported in the tammar wallaby previously  <cit> . rarefaction analysis indicated that an acceptable level of coverage had been achieved for acs sequences .

isolation and preliminary characterisation of acetogens from the tammar wallaby forestomach
three isolates in pure culture that were obtained from tammar wallaby forestomach enrichment cultures were considered potential acetogens after demonstrating the presence of fhs and showing net h <dig> and co <dig> consumption and producing acetate as the major end product when grown on modified ac <dig>  medium with h2:co <dig> provided. detailed analyses were only performed on one isolate, hereafter referred to as isolate twa <dig>  isolate twa <dig> was a strict anaerobe. phylogenetically, isolate twa <dig> classified within cluster xiv of the clostridium sub-phylum, within the family lachnospiraceae and demonstrated > 97% rrs identity to three recently isolated kangaroo acetogens: strains ye <dig>  ye <dig> and ye <dig> . the nearest named isolate to these species was ruminococcus gnavus, which demonstrated only  <dig> % rrs identity to isolate twa <dig>  the nearest named rumen acetogen was acetitomaculum ruminis which demonstrated  <dig> % identity to isolate twa <dig> . two copies of each of the key reductive acetogenesis genes acsb and fhs were recovered from isolate twa <dig>  the fthfs sequences showed ~ <dig> % amino acid similarity to each other and both affiliated with the clostridiaceae . the acs sequences demonstrated only  <dig> % amino acid identity to each other and one copy affiliated with the clostridiaceae while the second copy of acsb affiliated distantly with the lachnospiraceae .

morphology and cell structure of tammar wallaby isolate twa4
isolate twa <dig> grew as straight rods, varying in length from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm and diameter from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm . cells mainly occurred in pairs or sometimes in clusters or short chains of three to five cells. electron microscopy revealed a typical gram positive cell wall structure for twa <dig> , while staining properties and cellular morphology varied with culture conditions. for example, when glycerol was included in the culture medium, twa <dig> cells displayed white, electron-luscent dense areas , that were not present in cells grown on medium without glycerol . also, compared to twa <dig> cells grown without glycerol, cells grown with glycerol displayed a smaller amount of capsular material and were more prone to forming short chains. short stacks of membranes were frequently seen in cells grown without glycerol  but never when glycerol was present in the medium.figure  <dig>

metabolic and mixotrophic capabilities of tammar wallaby isolate twa4
when grown on modified ac <dig>  medium, isolate twa <dig> consumed net hydrogen  and carbon dioxide  with acetate  as the major end product . the maximal cell density under these conditions as measured by od <dig> was ~ <dig>  . there was large variability in the hydrogen consumption:acetate production ratios of individual cultures in this experiment, possibly as a result of subsampling gases and short chain fatty acids  every 6 hours throughout the culture progression. when cultures of isolate twa <dig> were not disturbed during incubation and gases and scfas were measured only at end point, hydrogen consumption:acetate production ratios of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  were observed.figure  <dig>

glycerol was found to be stimulatory to the growth and acetate production of isolate twa <dig> with hydrogen consumed concomitantly, indicating mixotrophy. over a 48 hour period, isolate twa <dig> produced significantly more acetate and higher cell densities when grown on medium with glycerol alone  or with glycerol plus h2:co <dig> , than when grown on medium with only h2:co <dig> available as substrate . hydrogen was consumed by isolate twa <dig> during growth under all three conditions and hydrogen consumption was not significantly different between medium with only h2:co <dig> available as substrates and medium with both glycerol and h2:co <dig> provided . hydrogen did not accumulate in significant amounts during growth of twa <dig> on glycerol alone and the residual hydrogen present in the headspace of culture from medium preparation in an anaerobic chamber, was consumed . during growth on glycerol alone, glycerol was consumed within 48 hours, acetate was the major end product , minor amounts of formate and citrate were also produced  and  <dig> -propanediol and other alcohols were not detected. during growth on glycerol alone, hydrogen accumulated to a maximum of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmoles  within 24 hours and thereafter declined to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μmoles over the next 24 hours .figure  <dig>

co-culture of isolate twa <dig> with a methanogen
cultures of m. smithii and isolate twa <dig> when grown together under h2:co <dig> consumed net hydrogen to produce both acetate and methane as end products, indicating successful growth of both strains. during the first 18 hours of growth, the pattern of hydrogen consumption and acetate production in co-cultures followed that observed for isolate twa <dig> alone , while methane production was significantly  reduced across this period for co-cultures compared to cultures of m. smithii alone . however, by 18 hours the hydrogen concentration in the headspace of culture tubes declined to approximately  <dig> μmoles , no further acetate production was observed and the remaining hydrogen was consumed and methanogenesis started to dominate acetogenesis .figure  <dig>

in co-cultures of isolate twa <dig> and m. smithii without h2:co <dig> provided but with glycerol as a substrate , acetate production was not significantly different to that observed by isolate twa <dig> alone  and the minimal methane that was produced was not significantly different  to that observed in pure cultures of m. smithii without an overpressure of h2:co <dig> in the headspace .

genomic analysis of isolate twa <dig> with respect to the acetyl-coa pathway and potential glycerol metabolism pathways
sequence reads assembled using newbler  generated eight scaffolds with an estimated genome size of  <dig>  mb at  <dig> times coverage.  <dig> % of the reads and  <dig> % of the contigs were assembled into the largest scaffold of just over  <dig>  mb. the average gap in the assembled data was calculated as 870 bp. orphan contigs greater than 500 bp and scaffolds produced  <dig>  mb of data that was comprised of  <dig> open reading frames of which 34% were of unknown function.

genes encoding the enzymes of the complete acetyl-coa pathway were present in the genome of isolate twa <dig>  and key genes of this pathway clustered together  with a gene order that did not resemble any of the five groups of wood-ljungdahl pathway gene clusters reported to date  <cit> . genes encoding enzymes for the degradation of glycerol to acetate via glycerol-3-phosphate were found in the genome of isolate twa <dig>  and genes encoding the enzymes glycerol dehydrogenase  and dihydroxyacetone kinase  which are responsible for conversion of glycerol to dihydroxyacetone-phosphate via dihydroxyacetone, were not evident in the genome of isolate twa <dig> .figure  <dig>

discussion
in order to fully understand complex microbial ecosystems and/or harness microbial activities for any useful purpose, it is essential that researchers combine the strengths of both cultivation and molecular-based techniques. in the present study we employed a combination of cultivation and molecular approaches to successfully enrich for acetogens from tammar wallaby forestomach contents, which had previously only been investigated by molecular methods  <cit> . molecular analysis of enrichment cultures in the present study revealed novel putative acetogens with functional genes affiliating between the lachnospiraceae and clostridiaceae and not close to sequences from any previously known acetogen . we successfully isolated one of these novel acetogens  which classified within the lachnospiraceae and may belong to the same species as recently isolated acetogens from the forestomach of eastern grey  and red kangaroos   <cit> .

isolate twa <dig> was a potent hydrogenotroph rapidly consuming exogenous hydrogen and carbon dioxide with acetate as the sole or primary end product. hydrogen consumption:acetate ratios for isolate twa <dig> were at times higher than expected based on stoichiometry of the acetyl-coa pathway of reductive acetogenesis , most likely due to consumption of hydrogen and carbon dioxide for formation of cell carbon and capsular material for new biomass, as end products other than acetate were not detected. genomic analysis confirmed the presence of all genes for the wood-ljungdahl acetyl-coa pathway of reductive acetogenesis in isolate twa <dig> . however, the order of key genes of this pathway in the isolate twa <dig> genome was not consistent with any of the previously reported gene orders for other microorganisms possessing this pathway  <cit> . the order of key wood-ljungdahl pathway genes in twa <dig> was remarkably similar to that of two other species whose genome has recently been completed, blautia hydrogenotrophica and ruminococcus obeum  and we propose that this ordering constitutes a new gene order group. though this gene ordering is most similar to the gene order of what is currently known as group c  <cit> , isolate twa <dig>  b. hydrogenotrophica and r. obeum all show replacement of the formyl tetrahydrofolate synthase, the bifunctional formyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase/dehydrogenase and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase cluster of group c with a second acsb copy . multiple copies of fhs and acsb have been detected in other pure culture acetogens using pcr-based methods previously  <cit> . the presence of two acsb and fhs in isolate twa <dig>  which match to the majority of acsb and fhs sequences recovered from tammar wallaby acetogen enrichment cultures , indicate that isolate twa <dig> was the dominant acetogen enriched for in the culture approach used in this study. functional genes from strain twa <dig> have been recovered from the tammar wallaby forestomach previously  <cit>  indicating that this species forms a substantial proportion of the acetogen population in the tammar wallaby forestomach naturally and is detectable without any selection or cultivation bias. however, these functional genes were not dominant within fthfs and acs libraries from the tammar wallaby forestomach naturally  <cit>  suggesting that other, potentially major, acetogens are present in vivo and were not selected for with the cultivation conditions used in the present study.

in addition to autotrophic growth, isolate twa <dig> demonstrated excellent mixotrophic capabilities, consuming hydrogen just as rapidly during growth on glycerol and h2:co <dig> as on h2:co <dig> alone and producing significantly more acetate and more than twice the cell mass as a result of mixotrophy. mixotrophy influences the competitiveness of acetogens over methanogens in some ecosystems  <cit>  and has been suggested as an important trait required for any acetogen that will be used in strategies for reducing ruminal methanogenesis  <cit> . while many acetogens are capable of mixotrophic growth, to date only one rumen acetogen with this ability has been reported  <cit> . it is generally thought that most rumen acetogens growing in the presence of carbohydrates will ferment the available substrate rather than grow autotrophically or mixotrophically  and in a mixed community they would therefore make hydrogen available for interspecies transfer  <cit>  to methanogens. our investigations of isolate twa <dig> in pure culture and in co-culture with a methanogen do not support this idea. in contrast to typical fermentative growth on glycerol  which results in accumulation of acetate, co <dig> and h <dig>  <cit>  isolate twa <dig> did not accumulate hydrogen as an end product. rather, hydrogen generated during fermentation was consumed , suggesting that isolate twa <dig> was able to internally shuttle or utilise most of the reducing equivalents generated during fermentation. furthermore, when isolate twa <dig> was grown heterotrophically with glycerol as a substrate, in co-culture with a methanogen, methanogenesis was not significantly stimulated . further experiments are necessary to confirm this finding with other methanogens and over longer growth periods, however it seems possible from these data that there may be potential to find appropriate acetogens to serve as alternative hydrogenotrophs in the rumen ecosystem in the future.

although isolate twa <dig> successfully performed reductive acetogenesis in the presence a hydrogenotrophic methanogen when hydrogen was available at high concentrations , isolate twa <dig> was not able to compete with a methanogen for hydrogen when hydrogen concentrations in the headspace were low , as expected based on the energetics of reductive acetogenesis and methanogenesis  <cit> . these findings are in agreement with the available literature which indicates that autotrophic acetogenesis alone will not dominate over methanogens under natural rumen conditions . however, potentially acetogen stimulation  along with methanogen suppression could be a useful strategy to establishing reductive acetogenesis as an alternative hydrogen sink in the rumen.

CONCLUSIONS
acetogens previously identified from the tammar wallaby forestomach by molecular methods were successfully enriched in culture. an acetogen obtained from these cultures, isolate twa <dig>  was a potent hydrogenotroph and capable of mixotrophic growth with glycerol. under heterotrophic conditions with glycerol, isolate twa <dig> did not significantly stimulate methane production by a co-cultured methanogen, suggesting that isolate twa <dig> might be able to internally recycle some of the reducing equivalents it generates during fermentation. while more detailed experiments with other methanogens and growth conditions are necessary to support our findings, the unique properties of tammar wallaby acetogens that we have observed could potentially be contributing factors to reduced methanogenesis and methanogen numbers in the tammar wallaby forestomach compared to the rumen. the macropod forestomach may be a useful source of acetogens for future strategies to reduce methane emissions from ruminants if these strategies also include some level of methane suppression and/or acetogen stimulation for example by harnessing mixotrophic growth capabilities .
