BACKGROUND
the microorganisms that populate the body, collectively known as the microbiota, are important drivers of host health and metabolism. characterization of the porcine microbiota using previous  techniques provides only a narrow understanding of the complexity of these ecosystems due to methodological limitations  <cit> . advancements in next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics have only recently given researchers the opportunity to examine the composition and diversity of these microbial populations in significant detail. presently, high-throughput sequencing of the hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna gene can provide a depth of coverage that is far greater than any previous method  <cit> .

the microbiotas of the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts of pigs are of particular interest due to the association of these body sites with common swine diseases or pathogens. these microbiotas provide a first line of defense against foreign invaders as competition and interaction between bacteria can protect a host from becoming colonized with particular pathogens  <cit> . however, the developing microbiota of young pigs is particularly vulnerable to disruptions which can result in long-term impacts that may affect disease susceptibility and growth performance  <cit> . such variation in the porcine microbiota has been associated with stress, diet, management practices, and antimicrobial compounds .

previous research exploring the gut microbiota in adult pigs using next-generation sequencing methods has revealed an incredibly diverse population of bacteria  <cit> . the adult porcine gut microbiota has been found to contain at least  <dig> identifiable bacterial phyla, the predominant being firmicutes and bacteroidetes, and at least  <dig> genera of bacteria  <cit> . similarly, the nasal cavity of adult pigs also harbours an incredibly diverse and rich microbial ecosystem which contains an estimated  <dig>  species of bacteria from  <dig> different genera. the porcine nasal microbiota was found to contain  <dig> phyla of bacteria, of which proteobacteria, firmicutes and spirochaetes predominated  <cit> .

however, despite the emerging understanding of the microbiota of adult pigs, characterization of the development of the early-age microbiota using next-generation techniques is lacking. further understanding of the fecal and nasal microbiotas can provide significant insight into swine health and susceptibility to disease, especially among young pigs who are particularly vulnerable. therefore, the objective of this longitudinal investigation was to characterize the transformation of the fecal and nasal microbiotas of conventionally-raised pigs throughout the first 7 weeks of life using high-throughput next-generation sequencing.

RESULTS
fecal microbiota
there were a total of  <dig> , <dig> sequences recovered from  <dig> fecal samples after removal of erroneous and poor quality reads. the median number of sequences per sample was  <dig>  . sequences recovered from the feces of  <dig> pigs over the 7-week period clustered into  <dig>  otus. the median number of otus recovered per pig during the study period was  <dig> . the otus were classified into  <dig> bacterial phyla and  <dig> genera, although only five phyla had >1 % overall relative abundance: firmicutes , proteobacteria , bacteroidetes , fusobacteria , and actinobacteria . only  <dig>  % of sequences were unclassified at the phylum level. however, the relative abundance of bacterial phyla varied considerably with age . specifically, aging was associated with a greater relative abundance of firmicutes , and lower relative abundance of proteobacteria , fusobacteria , and actinobacteria . the most dominant genera during the pre-weaning phase were clostridium and escherichia, while megasphaera and lactobacillus dominated the post-weaning phase .fig.  <dig> age-associated change in relative abundance of bacterial phyla from the feces of young pigs 



random subsampling of  <dig>  sequences was completed for each fecal sample to normalize sequence numbers. the median sample richness was  <dig> otus , although there was significant age-related variation as richness was positively correlated with age . the median inverse simpson’s diversity index was  <dig>   and diversity positively correlated with age . the age-related change in the number of observed and core otus is presented in fig.  <dig>  while measures of richness and diversity are shown in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> observed and core otus in subsampled fecal and nasal samples from young pigs. in this analysis, core otus were defined as observed otus shared between all pigs at a given time point

the core fecal microbiota was notably dichotomized between the pre-weaning and post-weaning phases of production . probabilistic modelling using ddm demonstrated the presence of two metacommunities , with 96 %  of fecal samples from suckling pigs being partitioned into one community type and 95 %  of fecal samples from weaned pigs being partitioned into another community type . analysis using the lefse algorithm  also revealed  <dig> otus characteristic of the pre-weaning stage and  <dig> otus characteristic of the post-weaning stage. the pre-weaning indicator otus clustered into the bacterial classes bacilli, negativicutes, actinobacteria and lentisphaeria, while the post-weaning indicator otus clustered into the classes betaproteobacteria, fibrobacteria, and chlamydiae .table  <dig> the genus-level taxonomy of abundant core otus of the porcine fecal and nasal microbiotas

the most common core otus  prior to weaning were from clostridia . interestingly, no core otus with >1 % relative abundance could be identified at 21 days of age. however, after weaning,  <dig> core otus were present throughout the entire nursery phase at >1 % relative abundance in at least 80 % of pigs: megasphaera, lactobacillus, and erysipelotrichaceae incertae sedis .

nasal microbiota
processing of  <dig> nasal samples yielded a total of  <dig> , <dig> sequences that passed the quality control measures. there was a median of  <dig>   sequences per sample. during the 7-week period, the nasal microbiota of  <dig> pigs yielded sequences that clustered into  <dig>  otus. there was a median of  <dig>  otus recovered per pig throughout the period of study . the otus were classified into  <dig> bacterial phyla and  <dig> genera. however, only three phyla had >1 % overall relative abundance: proteobacteria , firmicutes , and actinobacteria . only  <dig>  % of sequences were unclassified at the phylum level. the temporal shift in the relative abundance of bacterial phyla in the nasal microbiota is presented in fig.  <dig>  aging was associated with a reduction in actinobacteria  and an increase in proteobacteria , although a disruption in this trend was observed around the time of weaning causing the relative abundance of proteobacteria to rebound. the dominant genus at each phase of development was moraxella, with an average relative abundance ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig>  %. additionally, a high relative abundance of clostridium  was present before weaning but a shift in the microbiota after weaning led to an increased abundance of lactobacillus  and a corresponding decrease in clostridium .fig.  <dig> age-associated change in relative abundance of bacterial phyla from the nasal cavity of young pigs 



a random subsample of  <dig>  sequences was used for subsequent analysis. median sample richness was  <dig>  otus , and no age-related association was observed . the median inverse simpson’s diversity index was  <dig>   and, unlike richness, there was a positive correlation with age , although aging only accounted for a small proportion of the variation in diversity. a summary of the number of observed and core otus is shown in fig.  <dig>  and the age-related change in richness and diversity is presented in fig.  <dig> 

community membership  is presented in fig.  <dig>  interestingly, samples appear to cluster into  <dig> age-dependent categories; day 1– <dig>  day 7– <dig>  and day 28– <dig>  however, when analyzed by amova, the jaccard indices differed significantly between all age groups . visualization of community structure  is displayed in additional file 2: figure s <dig> as a dendrogram. yue and clayton indices differed between all age groups  with the exception of 7-day-old and 14-day-old pigs , and 35-day-old, 42-day-old, and 49-day-old pigs . there were also significant differences between the pre-weaning and post-weaning phases for both the jaccard  and yue and clayton indices .fig.  <dig> three-dimensional principal coordinates analysis of the community membership of the porcine nasal microbiota . coloured points and ellipses indicate age groups:  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  days of age



there was a noticeable difference in the pre-weaning and post-weaning nasal microbiota. the lefse algorithm  demonstrated the presence of  <dig> otus characteristic to pre-weaning pigs and  <dig> otus characteristic to post-weaning pigs. the pre-weaning indicator otus clustered into the bacterial classes bacilli, flavobacteria, alphaproteobacteria, and betaproteobacteria, and the post-weaning indicator otus clustered into the classes clostridia, fusobacteria, actinobacteria, chlamydiae, and deferribacteres .fig.  <dig> cladogram of bacterial nasal biomarkers associated with phase of production . samples were grouped into pre-weaning  or post-weaning . this hierarchal tree of taxonomical nodes, where diameter of the nodes indicates relative abundance, shows nasal biomarkers for the pre-weaning and post-weaning phases



the evolving core nasal microbiota is described in table  <dig>  during the first 3 days of life, the genera haemophilus, globicatella, and rothia formed the core microbiota in addition to clostridium sensu stricto which was also present throughout the entire pre-weaning period. following weaning, lactobacillus was the only genus present throughout the entire nursery phase at >1 % abundance in at least 80 % of pigs.

discussion
the fecal and nasal microbiotas of young pigs display rich and diverse bacterial communities which undergo a very rapid and profound evolution during the first 7 weeks of life. during this developmental period a herd of pigs is exposed to thousands of bacterial species which play an important pioneering role in establishing a stable microbiota that is evident at 2– <dig> weeks post-weaning, particularly for the fecal microbiota. however, the instability of the microbiota during early life means it may be more susceptible to dysbiosis which can create predispositions to other illnesses as has been reported in human studies  <cit> . this has created the framework for the role of microorganisms in the ‘programming hypothesis’ which claims that manifestation of diseases later in life can be predetermined by exposure to environmental stimuli during early life  <cit> . some research with swine have demonstrated that antimicrobials, excessive hygiene, stress, and management practices have a long-term impact on the gut microbiota  which may contribute to disease susceptibility or resistance. for example, it has been suggested that the abundance of lactobacilli may influence host immunity and disease susceptibility due to the immunomodulatory activity of these bacteria  <cit> . further research exploring the relationship between the microbiota and the early-life programming of health in swine is warranted.

the fecal microbiota described in the present study is similar to previous studies which have found firmicutes and proteobacteria to be the predominant phyla pre-weaning  <cit> . however, studies of the fecal microbiota at 3-months of age demonstrate that a taxonomical shift results in the predominance of firmicutes and bacteroidetes  <cit> . the beginning of this shift was also observed in the present study; proteobacteria are very dominant during early life  but undergo a considerable decline into adulthood , and the transition into adulthood is marked by an establishment of core otus belonging to bacteroidetes . proteobacteria, mainly comprising of escherichia, are common early colonizers of the colon and the early decline in this taxa is possibly due to increased competition from obligate anaerobes  and colonization resistance due to the immunological properties of colostrum  <cit> .

some notable otus that were abundant and formed the core microbiota after weaning belonged to butyrate-producing genera including megasphaera, butyricicoccus, and roseburia. butyrate is an essential energy source for enterocytes and it supports gut health by inhibiting inflammation, reducing oxidative stress, and promoting gut-barrier defense  <cit> . additionally, the predominance of megasphaera after weaning may be related to its extensive metabolic capabilities which include the production of vitamins, amino acids, and short-chain fatty acids  <cit> .

the microbiota of the anterior nasal passage of young pigs described in the current investigation demonstrates similarities to the nasal microbiota of adult pigs that has previously been studied using next-generation sequencing methods  <cit> . during early-life, there was an apparent co-dominance between proteobacteria and firmicutes, but after weaning there was a noticeable shift in dominance towards proteobacteria which is also the predominant phylum observed in adult pigs  <cit> . this transition appeared to coincide with weaning and was marked by an increase in gammaproteobacteria  and a decrease in clostridium and bacilli. the genus moraxella is of particular interest due to its high abundance in pigs throughout life. previous research has found that moraxella is inversely associated with haemophilus colonization in humans  <cit> . it is possible that moraxella plays a protective role in the nasal cavity of pigs by preventing colonization with certain swine pathogens ; although this requires much further research.

aging appeared to be the most significant driver of development of the fecal and nasal microbiotas, although weaning also played an important role. the reported changes in richness, diversity, relative abundance, and community structure and membership all appeared to follow trends that were independent of weaning, but that is not to say weaning was insignificant. the microbiota did respond to this event with noticeable changes in core otus and the detection of specific biomarker otus. however, this study was unable to determine whether these changes at weaning were associated with the change in diet, mixing of pigs, stress, or other variables encountered during this event. furthermore, the rapidly evolving fecal microbiota of young pigs appears to reach a developmental milestone at approximately 2– <dig> weeks post-weaning. this is demonstrated by the decelerating change in relative abundance of taxa, the clustering of community membership and structure, the plateauing of richness and diversity, and the change in core otus. this is less evident for the nasal microbiota, but there are still indications of stability or convergence towards stability during this period.

the present characterization of the early-life microbiota of conventionally-raised pigs using next-generation sequencing provides a broader view of the microbial landscape than previous studies that have employed culture-based methods, fingerprinting, sanger sequencing, microarrays, and 454-sequencing  <cit>  and is novel in using next-generation sequencing technology to characterize the early-life nasal microbiota, which is poorly described in the literature. however, one of the limitations of the present study is over- or under-representation of particular taxa due to amplification bias. this study also involved only healthy pigs with no clinical presentation of disease and the study was conducted at only one farm, so inter-farm variability and the impact of farm environment and management could not be assessed. additionally, the fecal microbiota is only representative of the distal gastrointestinal tract  and characterization of important bacteria populations from the stomach and small intestine may be absent or under-represented.

CONCLUSIONS
the fecal and nasal microbiotas of pigs undergo a remarkable evolution during the first 7 weeks of life. the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts are exposed to thousands of bacteria species with significant turn-over in community membership and structure until a relative degree of stability is evident at 2– <dig> weeks post-weaning. future research should explore the significance of variation in the microbial population ecology during early-life and its implication for pathogen shedding and disease susceptibility in both young and adult pigs.
