BACKGROUND
therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia  is a secondary malignancy attributable to chemotherapy and/or radiation exposure. t-aml comprises 5-20% of adult aml cases and its prevalence is increasing along with the size of the population undergoing chemotherapy  <cit> . while chemotherapy regimen  <cit>  and genetic background  <cit>  contribute to t-aml, the risk factors are not well understood. strong evidence for genetic predisposition to t-aml is provided by inherited cancer syndromes such as neurofibromatosis, where germline mutations of nf <dig> are associated with increased risk of t-aml in humans and mice  <cit> . gaining a better understanding of t-aml susceptibility factors is a pressing concern as it may lead to prevention strategies and provide insight into the genesis of de novo aml.

one class of chemotherapeutics associated with t-aml is the alkylators . the therapeutic effect of alkylator agents is believed to result from the formation of dna adducts and single and double-strand breaks, which trigger apoptosis or growth arrest  <cit> . based on this presumed mechanism of alkylator action, genes involved in dna repair  <cit> , response to oxidative stress  <cit> , and drug metabolism  <cit>  have been investigated as mediators of t-aml susceptibility in candidate gene studies, with largely inconclusive results. a recent study in our lab investigated the genetic basis of t-aml susceptibility using inbred mice  <cit> . in this study, eight to twelve individual mice from each of  <dig> inbred strains were treated with the alkylating agent n-nitroso-n-ethylurea , a potent mutagen with a propensity to cause at:ta transversions and at:gc transitions  <cit> . mice were monitored for the development of aml for up to  <dig> months post enu exposure. the incidence of aml varied by strain from  <dig> to 80% , supporting the hypothesis that there is a strong genetic component in t-aml susceptibility.

we hypothesized that the pre-exposure transcriptional state of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, the putative target of leukemogenesis  <cit> , underlies variation in susceptibility to t-aml. a pre-exposure transcriptional basis of susceptibility would be expected if a rapid response is critical in determining a cell's ultimate fate upon mutagen exposure. this hypothesis is consistent with the observation that expression of genes critical to surviving genotoxic stress in yeast does not change after exposure to dna-damaging agents  <cit> , implying that the necessary factors are already expressed at baseline. a similar situation has been reported in human lymphoblastoid cell lines, in which the pre-exposure transcriptional state of the cell more accurately predicts survival after alkylator treatment than the post-exposure state  <cit> .

in this study, we apply an integrated genomics approach  <cit>  to identify and prioritize genetic and transcriptional networks underlying t-aml susceptibility in mice . by linking expression profiles and complex traits to common genomic loci, this method can ameliorate some of the limitations inherent in genetic association and expression profiling studies  <cit> . when combined with network analysis, this methodology has proven useful in elucidating the biological pathways underlying several complex traits  <cit> .

RESULTS
an integrated genetic map of inbred mouse strains
previously, we reported expression quantitative trait loci  in mice using inherited dna copy number variant regions  as genetic markers  <cit> . this cis-eqtl map did not explicitly include other sources of genetic variation . to derive a more complete map of cis-eqtls in this population, we used publicly available snp data from  <dig> classical inbred strains to map snp-based eqtls http://www.broadinstitute.org/mouse/hapmap/. the snp resource includes  <dig>  snps per genome, of which  <dig>  we considered informative . we used these data to derive haplotype blocks, which are ancestral regions of shared genetic background among strains. haplotype blocks facilitate trait mapping because they robustly and efficiently represent un-typed genetic variation at a locus. the practical benefit of utilizing haplotype blocks instead of individual snps is a reduced number of statistical tests. we used a simple merging algorithm to iteratively join adjacent snps into haplotype blocks. this algorithm results in haplotype blocks in which the genotypes of a complete set of snps are predictable to a given level of accuracy. we selected a threshold such that for a given block, we can accurately predict the genotype of every snp in all  <dig> strains with at most one error . the  <dig>  resulting haplotype blocks are comprised of  <dig> to  <dig> snps  . the multi-snp blocks range in length from  <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> bp . there are  <dig> to  <dig> haplotypes per block  . only  <dig> blocks include haplotypes that are assigned to a single strain.  <dig>  blocks have one error, and the remaining  <dig>  have zero. of the  <dig>  cnvrs within  <dig> kb of a haplotype block boundary, only one cnvr has a genotype that is tagged  by a snp-based haplotype . we speculated that the low ability of snp-derived haplotypes to tag cnvrs was due to the fact that using all  <dig> classical inbred strains in the haplotype block construction resulted in higher numbers of haplotype labels. therefore, we also derived a haplotype block map using only the  <dig> strains from the cnvr study, resulting in a similar inability of snp-haplotyes to tag cnvrs . this suggests that in current databases of genetic variation in the mouse genome, the majority of cnvrs are not captured by snp resources.

global pre-exposure transcriptional state of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells is associated with t-aml susceptibility
we performed gene expression profiling  in c-kit+/lineage-  bone marrow cells  from  <dig> inbred strains listed as tier 1- <dig> from the mouse phenome database  <cit> . two-to-three biological replicate arrays were analyzed per strain. this gene expression profiling  data was previously published  <cit> . fifteen of the strains were previously assayed for susceptibility to t-aml after exposure to enu  <cit> . unsupervised clustering of gene expression profiles largely separated susceptible from resistant strains . the probability that the unsupervised clustering of expression profiles predicts susceptibility status by chance is <  <dig>  . further, this clustering is not observed in other tissues that are highly unlikely to be involved in leukemogenesis , nor does it reflect snp-based strain distances . taken together, this supports the notion that the kl clustering of susceptible strains is not due to sequence polymorphism affecting target hybridization  <cit> , but rather reflects tissue-specific differences in transcript abundance between inbred strains  <cit> . additionally, this observation suggests that the pre-exposure expression differences of many genes, rather than only a few, segregate the kl cells of t-aml susceptible versus resistant strains.

next, we asked which genes were differentially expressed between susceptible and resistant strains in kl cells. we identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes  at an fdr threshold of 5% . the differentially expressed genes are enriched in several go-annotated biological processes , including the go terms 'apoptotic program' and 'nucleotide metabolic process'. the kegg pathways 'pyrimidine metabolism' and colorectal cancer' were also enriched. 'acute myeloid leukemia' and 'p <dig> signaling' are biologically plausible pathways that were enriched at least two-fold in the differentially expressed genes, however neither of these pathways passed the fdr < 25% threshold. go-apoptosis-annotated genes included both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic factors .

integrated cis-eqtl mapping identifies candidate drivers of t-aml susceptibility
our previous eqtl analysis identified  <dig> expression traits  in kl cells that were associated with  <dig> cnvrs  <cit> . we repeated this analysis using the 48-strain haplotype resource to map kl expression traits to snp-based haplotypes. we considered only cis-eqtl-associated genes, as it has been shown that trans-eqtls contain a large proportion of false positives  <cit> . we found  <dig> associations between expression traits and haplotypes, after selecting the most significant association per trait. in the current study, we used the combined set of snp- and cnvr-based eqtls to discover and explore genetically driven modules of co-expressed genes associated with t-aml susceptibility.

there are  <dig> genes  that are both differentially expressed and linked to at least one eqtl. we refer to these genes as anchors throughout the text.  <dig> are linked to cnvr-eqtls; the remaining  <dig> are linked to haplotype-eqtls. to validate the cis-eqtl associations, we mined publicly available expression data representing hematopoietic stem, progenitor, erythroid and myeloid populations from the bxd recombinant inbred panel  <cit> . because this data was generated using the same gep platform that we used, we were able to ask how our kl population is related to these more purified populations . as expected, our kl expression profiles cluster most closely with stem and progenitor profiles and are distinct from both erythroid and myeloid lineages. for each anchor gene, we tested the association between bxd genotypes of snps within  <dig> mb and anchor expression and corrected for multiple testing. we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> anchors were significantly associated with at least one snp within  <dig> mb in at least one of the hematopoietic compartments , supporting the hypothesis that expression differences of the anchor are caused by locally encoded genetic variation. of  <dig> testable eqtls-transcript associations,  <dig>  were replicated in at least one of the hematopoietic data sets. kl eqtls may have failed to validate in the other tissues because they are false positives, because the causative genetic variant does not exist in the bxd strains, or due to tissue-specific expression regulation.

anchored network analysis identifies t-aml susceptibility expression modules
next, we hypothesized that expression differences of anchor genes would cause expression differences  on multiple downstream genes . for each anchor, we identified correlated expression profiles , resulting in  <dig> sets of co-expressed genes or modules. the number of targets per module ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . we reasoned that true response genes will exhibit association with anchor expression even when the remaining genome is randomly shuffled, as it is in the bxd recombinant inbred cross. for each module, we tested the association between expression of the anchor and each response transcript in each of the bxd hematopoietic populations. we removed target genes from modules that were not associated with anchor gene expression in at least one population  . we also used a weighted gene co-expression network analysis   <cit> , to derive modules of correlated genes independent of linkage to eqtls. we filtered these modules on the basis of their reproducibility in the bxd dataset and compared the resulting modules with the anchored expression networks. the wgcna modules are highly similar to the anchored modules in gene content, suggesting that the discovered co-expression structure is robust to different algorithms .

the expression of each anchor gene is, by definition, associated with susceptibility status. however, the strength of the association between the target genes of an anchored module and susceptibility is unknown. to determine these values, we first computed eigengenes from each module  <cit> . then, we ranked anchored modules according to differential expression of the module's eigengene and susceptibility status. using both kegg and go annotations, we found that  <dig> anchored modules were enriched in at least one annotation. we visualized the anchored susceptibility modules as both heatmaps of eigengene values  and networks , displaying the correlation between anchored modules and the strength of association between anchored modules and susceptibility status. we also visualized one of the anchored susceptibility networks, focusing on a biologically compelling module .

discussion
there is accumulating evidence that many genetic contributors to complex traits are not protein-coding changes  <cit> . if true, then other classes of genetic events that can affect phenotype must, at some level, impact gene expression . hypothesizing that such events contribute to t-aml susceptibility, we took an integrated genomics approach to identify and prioritize candidate transcriptional networks. the first step in this approach was to identify eqtls in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, the likely target of leukemic transformation. previously, we described a cnvr eqtl map in classical inbred mice  <cit> . in the current work, we expanded this map to include snp-based haplotype eqtls. in deriving the mouse haplotype map, we found surprisingly little correlation between haplotypes and neighboring cnvrs. this is in contrast to human studies, where nearly 75% of common cnvrs are estimated to be in linkage disequilibrium with neighboring snps  <cit> . this suggests that at the currently available resolution and coverage , mouse haplotypes and cnvrs represent distinct sources of genetic information. we found two-fold more cnvr eqtls than haplotype-based eqtls . it is tempting to speculate that this difference in eqtl types is because cnvrs have a stronger impact on expression in cis and therefore are more likely to be detected as eqtls. however, the difference could largely be due to the reduced power to detect haplotype eqtls because of the exacerbated multiple testing problem that comes with performing approximately  <dig> times more statistical tests. in total, greater than 60% of the eqtls were reproducible in an independent dataset.

the second step in the integrated approach was to find genes differentially expressed between t-aml susceptible and resistant strains. because unsupervised clustering using all expressed transcripts grouped strains by susceptibility status, we expected to find a large number of genes associated with susceptibility. greater than 7% of the expressed transcripts are differentially expressed . these genes are enriched in several, independent biological processes, most notably apoptosis. among the differentially expressed intrinsic apoptosis genes are caspase  <dig> , b-cell leukemia/lymphoma  <dig> , bcl2-associated agonist of cell death , bcl2-associated x protein , and muts homolog  <dig> . msh <dig> is a member of the mutsα dna mismatch recognition complex that has been shown to mediate apoptosis in certain contexts  <cit> . notably, the absence of mutsα activity in myeloid progenitors results in the complete loss of o6-methylguanine -mediated cytotoxicity  <cit> . that resistant strains have higher expression of msh <dig> suggests that upon alkylator exposure, resistant strains may recognize dna damage and respond appropriately  whereas the kl cells of susceptible strains may tend to survive, accumulate mutations, and become transformed. in kl cells, almost all susceptible strains have no detectable expression of casp <dig>  an initiator of programmed cell death, suggesting that these cells  are less primed for casp9-dependent apoptosis. although knockout of casp <dig> in mice is embryonic lethal, presumably due to severe brain development defects  <cit> , casp <dig> is not required for apoptosis during normal hematopoiesis  <cit> . therefore, inbred strains may exhibit genetically-driven yet tissue-specific differences in apoptosis such that hematopoietic cells of susceptible strains are relatively protected from cell death after exposure to genotoxic stress.

differential expression and gene enrichment analysis highlighted several biologically plausible pathways that may underlie t-aml susceptibility. however, it remained unclear which pathway members, if any, are causal contributors to the phenotype, as illustrated by the complex expression patterns of the intrinsic apoptosis genes. more broadly, the role and relative importance of each of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes in susceptibility remained undetermined. we hypothesized that among the  <dig> differentially expressed genes would be a subset in which expression variation is caused by cis-encoded genetic variation. further, we posited that these 'anchor' genes cause expression variation of multiple downstream genes, which collectively are associated with t-aml susceptibility . the mechanisms by which anchors might act in trans are varied. they include altered transcription factor abundance and homeostatic or compensatory forces within and between biological pathways. regardless of the mechanisms of action, the identification of putative events that influence susceptibility and their linkage to gene networks forms a powerful and practical strategy to both find biological pathways underlying cancer susceptibility and to prioritize candidate mediators. therefore, as the third step in the integrated genomics approach, we identified networks of genes that are significantly correlated with candidate susceptibility anchors. to validate the networks, we used independent gene expression data from multiple hematopoietic populations, trimming the networks of response genes whose expression was not reproduced.

one of the benefits of the integrated genomics approach is that it can implicate biological processes that would not have been detected using differential expression alone. the susceptibility networks that we identified are enriched in genes involved in dna repair, base excision repair, apoptosis, and cell cycle, among other annotations. a second potential benefit of the integrated approach is that it differentiates between upstream  and response genes, an advantage over existing approaches that derive gene regulatory networks from expression data alone. while this is a hypothesis that remains to be tested, the identification of candidate upstream factors will be useful in prioritizing among apoptosis-related genes for experimental validation. for example, although casp <dig> and bcl <dig> are differentially expressed, casp <dig> is also the candidate anchor of module a_ <dig>  the module most strongly associated with susceptibility status. we speculate that perturbation of candidate anchors, such as casp <dig>  are more likely to be informative in elucidating susceptibility than response genes .

network analysis allowed us to predict the function of uncharacterized genes. for example, a630001g21rik is expressed primarily in primitive hematopoietic and b-cells  <cit> , yet its function is undetermined. our analysis places it as the anchor of module a_ <dig>  which is enriched in apoptosis-related genes, including bcl <dig>  therefore, a630001g21rik may play previously unknown role in regulation of bcl <dig> expression and apoptosis activity. similarly, cytoskeleton-associated protein-like  <dig>  is the anchor of the largest module, a_ <dig>  enriched in both cell cycle and dna repair genes. although ckap2l is highly expressed in hematopoietic progenitors  <cit> , its functions are unknown. its closest ortholog, ckap <dig>  is highly expressed in mouse stem cell lines and has detectable expression in hematopoietic progenitors, bone marrow, osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and macrophages  <cit> . there is a growing body of literature suggesting that ckap <dig>  is involved in cell cycle progression  <cit> . it is possible that ckap2l contributes to cell cycle regulation in hscs and progenitors, and that genetic disturbances of its expression impact t-aml susceptibility. experiments that perturb expression of anchor genes such as casp <dig> and ckap2l to assess their impact on module expression and activity are the next logical steps in determining the role of candidate networks in susceptibility. if such experiments demonstrate a causal link between anchor genes and module expression, then moving forward to formally define their role in leukemia will be warranted.

a drawback to the anchored network approach, as currently implemented, is that it assumes there is only a single anchor per module. in cases where cnvrs disrupt regulatory elements, it is possible that a single genetic event impacts the expression of multiple neighboring genes. for example, in module a_ <dig>  we found  <dig> response genes within  <dig> mb of a cnvr. this module warrants special attention because it includes poly  polymerase family member  <dig>  and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease  <dig> , both members of the base excision repair pathway  <cit> . both genes have lower expression in susceptible strains, again suggesting that lowered overall dna damage response promotes susceptibility.

a caveat to the current work is that maps of genetic variation in the mouse genome are incomplete, a knowledge gap that promises to be filled by more informative snp arrays  <cit>  and next-generation sequencing  <cit> . it is possible that un-captured genetic variants may be the ultimate cause of the observed co-expression networks. these variants may mediate their impact through mechanisms other than altering the expression of anchors. in the extreme case, all modules may not be controlled by anchor expression, but by undetected causes. nevertheless, the modules themselves are still informative in that they describe sets of coordinately regulated genes that, collectively, are associated with both t-aml susceptibility and biologically plausible processes and pathways.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first report of an integrated genomics approach to dissect the role of the pre-exposure transcriptional state in t-aml susceptibility. from a clinical perspective, t-aml is important because the response to treatment is poor and survival is short  <cit> . but because t-aml is a clinically-induced malignancy, it is by definition preventable. therefore, a long-term goal in this field is to gain sufficient understanding of susceptibility factors in order to make worthwhile the personalization of chemotherapeutic regimens based on t-aml risk. the transcriptional networks and their candidate anchors described here are an important early step towards gaining such an understanding.
