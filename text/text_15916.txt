BACKGROUND
drought and low temperature are two major environmental stresses that greatly affect plant growth and crop production worldwide. this is particularly the case in arid and cold areas. to improve the tolerance of crops and other economic plants to these stresses, it is essential to know how plants respond to these stresses and which genes and biological pathways are involved in the stress tolerance. over the past decades, thousands of genes and dozens of metabolic and signaling pathways have been identified in plants during drought and cold stresses . some of these genes have been confirmed to significantly improve plant tolerance to drought, cold and/or salt stresses  <cit> . in addition, many genes have been found to be commonly or specifically regulated under drought and cold in arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and brachypodium  <cit>  at transcriptional level. however, similar studies are very limited in other plants, and the molecular mechanisms controlling plant tolerance to both drought and cold remain largely unknown.

ammopiptanthus is an endangered survivor from the tethys in the tertiary period, and is the only evergreen broadleaf shrub grown in the central asian desert. the genus ammopiptanthus  comprises of two species: a. mongolicus  cheng f. and a. nanus  cheng f. both species are diploid with  <dig> chromosomes and have high stress tolerance  <cit> . the habitats of a. mongolicus are marked by arid climate with an annual precipitation less than 200 mm but a mean annual evaporation up to 3000 mm. its natural distribution areas are also characterized as sandy or stony soil with high salinity, intense ultraviolet irradiation, and seasonally extreme temperature from about –30°c in winter to more than 40°c in summer. the extreme tolerance of this species to harsh environments makes it invaluable for exploring key stress-tolerant genes and mechanisms, especially those involved in cold and drought tolerance.

the transcriptomes of a. mongolicus roots  and seedlings  were recently sequenced by  <dig> pyrosequencing  <cit>  and illumina technology  <cit> , respectively. these studies generated  <dig> and  <dig> unigenes and identified  <dig> cold-regulated genes. however, transcriptome profiling of this species under drought stress and its comparison with cold stress have not been reported in the literatures.

in the present study, we firstly performed a comprehensive transcriptome sequencing of a. mongolicus using pooled mrna extracted from drought-treated, cold-treated and control seedlings as well as young leaves of plants grown in desert in both summer and winter. we then applied rna-seq  to investigate seven cdna libraries derived from the seedling samples exposed to drought and cold stresses for 2 h, 8 h and 24 h, and the non-stressed control seedlings respectively. finally, we analyzed the degs and identified common and specific degs during drought and cold treatments. our study provided the first transcriptome profile of a. mongolicus under drought stress and the comparison of it with the transcriptome profile under cold stress.

RESULTS

identification and validation of differentially expressed genes 
transcriptome changes of the a. mongolicus seedlings under drought and cold stresses  and unstressed control were analyzed using illumina technology. between  <dig>  and  <dig>  m clean reads  were obtained from the seven libraries. approximately  <dig>  to  <dig>  m of the clean reads in each library were mapped to the  <dig> unigenes assembled earlier in this study , accounting for  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the total clean reads . in the d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> libraries ,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> unigenes were up-regulated and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> unigenes were down-regulated, respectively. similar results were observed in the c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> libraries , including  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> unigenes with up-regulation and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> unigenes with down-regulation, respectively . taken together,  <dig> and  <dig> unigenes were identified as degs with an absolute value of log <dig> ratio ≥  <dig> and fdr  ≤  <dig>  at one or more time points during drought and cold stresses, respectively.to validate the rna-seq results,  <dig> degs with different expression patterns were selected for rt-qpcr  analysis. these genes encode nac  and dreb  tfs, hsp , glp , tpp  and ccd . nine  of these genes showed similar expression patterns to those detected by the rna-seq data , while other two genes had similar expression trends at one to two time points. thus, the rna-seq results were considerably reliable for the identification of degs during drought and cold stresses in this study.table  <dig>

validation of expression patterns of nine degs by rt-qpcr assay. nine degs  showed similar expression patterns between rna-seq data  and rt-qpcr assay . these genes included six genes up-regulated under drought and cold stresses: amnac <dig> , amnac <dig>  amnac <dig>  amdreb2c , amdreb <dig> and amtpp ; two genes down-regulated under both stresses: amhsp  and amccd ; and one gene with different expression trends: amglp . d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> represented  <dig>   <dig> and 24 h after drought treatment; c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> represented  <dig>   <dig> and 24 h after cold treatment. the total rnas used for the transcriptome profile analyses using rna-seq were used in the rt-qpcr assay, including three biological replicates. the relative expression levels of the selected genes were calculated using the 2–ΔΔct method. error bars represented the standard deviation of the mean expression values.



differentially expressed genes in response to drought stress
of  <dig> to  <dig> degs identified at the three time points of drought treatment,  <dig> degs  were common across all three time points, including  <dig> degs with up-regulation,  <dig> degs with down-regulation  and  <dig> degs with complex regulation. the common degs represented reproducible changes at each time point. between  <dig> and  <dig> degs  were specifically regulated at a single time point, including  <dig> to  <dig> degs with up-regulation and  <dig> to  <dig> degs with down-regulation. besides, many degs were common at two of the three time points . the top  <dig> degs commonly regulated by drought stress were listed in the additional file  <dig> figure  <dig> 
venn diagrams showing the numbers of common and specific degs at different time points of drought and cold treatments. the up-regulated  and down-regulated  degs  identified at  <dig>   <dig> and 24 h after drought  and cold  treatments were analyzed. the numbers of common and specific degs at different time points were shown in the overlapping and non-overlapping regions, respectively. the total numbers of up- and down-regulated degs at each time point were indicated in parentheses.



among the common degs up-regulated at the three time points, genes known to respond to drought or other stresses were largely represented, such as those encoding ripening-related proteins, lea  proteins, peroxidases, transporters, enzymes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathways, protein kinases, and ethylene receptors. many tfs in multiple families were also up-regulated, including the ap2/erebp , nac, wrky, myb , bhlh , c2h <dig> , bzip , c3h , gras , tcp , col , dof , and grf  families, etc. approximately  <dig> %  of the common degs were functional unknowns. similarly, the common degs down-regulated at the three time points of drought stress had a wide range of functions. for example, genes encoding aquaporin nip, polyol transporter, gibberellin, small heat shock proteins, calcium-binding proteins, and some bhlh tfs appeared in this group. interestingly, the unknowns in the down-regulated degs  were almost twice as those in the commonly up-regulated degs.

based on go enrichment analysis, a large number of the degs commonly up-regulated in drought were mostly enriched in two similar biological processes: “response to stimulus” and “response to stress”, followed by “organic substance transport”, “cellular aromatic compound metabolic process” and “protein phosphorylation”. in contrast, the commonly down-regulated degs were significantly enriched in the biological processes “monocarboxylic acid metabolism”, “small molecule biosynthesis” and “nucleobase transport”. in the cellular component and molecular function categories, the commonly up- and down-regulated degs were significantly enriched in similar terms, such as “membrane” and “oxidoreductase activity” . kegg pathway enrichment analysis revealed that genes involved in microbial metabolism in diverse environments and some secondary metabolite degradation were significantly enriched in both the up- and down-regulated degs. however, genes in the pathways for nitrogen and phenylalanine metabolisms were specifically enriched in the up-regulated degs; while genes involved in metabolic pathways and the pathways for starch and sucrose metabolism as well as carotenoid biosynthesis were only enriched in the down-regulated degs .

as expected, many regulatory genes were specifically up-regulated at the first time point , such as genes encoding some types of protein kinases, calcium-binding proteins, tfs, as well as enzymes or components in plant hormone  biosyntheses or signaling pathways. after the treatment was prolonged , many of these regulatory genes were no longer differentially expressed. instead, a large number of functional genes were up-regulated, such as genes encoding osmoprotectant synthetases, dehydration-protective proteins, pr  proteins, hydrolases, and detoxification enzymes.

differentially expressed genes in response to cold stress
between  <dig> and  <dig> degs were identified at a single time point during cold treatment, and  <dig> degs were common across the three time points, including  <dig> with up-regulation and  <dig> with down-regulation . the top  <dig> degs commonly regulated by cold stress were listed in the additional file  <dig>  similar to drought stress, many commonly up-regulated degs were annotated to well-known stress- or cold-induced genes. some of these genes are identical to the drought-induced genes; while others encode different types of proteins, such as fatty acid desaturases, chitinases and proteins or enzymes located in chloroplast. the common degs down-regulated at three time points of cold stress also encode various functional and regulatory proteins. notably,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the commonly up- or down-regulated degs were unknowns, respectively.

a large number of the degs up-regulated under cold stress were significantly enriched in the biological processes “response to stimulus”, “response to stress”, “defense response” and “cellular aromatic compound metabolic process”. in the down-regulated degs, the mostly represented go term of biological process was also “response to stimulus”, followed by “lipid biosynthetic process”, “organic acid biosynthetic process” and “lipid localization”. interestingly, in the cellular component category, the up-regulated degs were mostly enriched in “plastid” and “chloroplast”; while the down-regulated degs were not significantly enriched in any terms of this category . kegg pathway analysis revealed that the metabolic pathways and the pathways for secondary metabolite biosynthesis or degradation were significantly enriched in both the up- and down-regulated degs. however, the pathways involved in phenylalanine metabolism and photosynthesis were exclusively enriched in the up-regulated degs. in contrast, the pathways related to fatty acid metabolism, carotenoid biosynthesis and several amino acid degradations were only enriched in the down-regulated degs .

differentially expressed genes co-regulated during drought and cold stresses
among the  <dig> drought-regulated and  <dig> cold-regulated degs with significant expression changes  at one or more time points,  <dig> degs were co-regulated by both stresses, accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total degs, respectively. of the co-regulated degs,  <dig> degs had significant expression changes at all drought- and cold-treated time points, including  <dig> with up-regulation,  <dig> with down-regulation and  <dig> with complex regulation patterns. the results clearly showed an overlap between the degs in response to drought and cold. the top  <dig> co-regulated degs were listed in the additional file  <dig> 

of the  <dig> co-regulated degs,  <dig> degs  were annotated as tfs, including the ap2/erebp, nac, wrky, myb, bhlh, c2h <dig>  bzip, gras, c3h, dof, tcp, col and grf families. in addition,  <dig> co-regulated degs were annotated as protein kinases and phosphatases, and  <dig> co-regulated degs as synthetases or components in plant hormone biosynthesis or signaling. besides, many stress-related functional genes appeared in the co-up-regulated degs, such as those encoding the enzymes in flavonoid biosynthetic pathways, ripening related proteins, thaumatin-like or osmotin-like proteins, transporters, cell wall-associated proteins, and some types of pr proteins.

the co-up-regulated degs were significantly aggregated into two go biological processes: response to stress and secondary metabolite  biosynthesis or metabolism. however, the co-down-regulated degs were significantly enriched in carboxylic acid metabolic process and fatty acid or lipid biosynthetic process. in the molecular function category, the co-up- or co-down-regulated degs were mainly related to catalytic activity or oxidoreductase activity. unexpectedly, both the up- and down-regulated degs were not significantly enriched in any cellular component terms .table  <dig>

according to kegg pathway analysis, the co-up-regulated degs were significantly enriched in eight pathways. most of these pathways are completely or highly overlapped and actually belong to two pathways: microbial metabolism in diverse environments and biosyntheses of secondary metabolites. in contrast, the co-down-regulated degs were mainly assigned to metabolic pathways and starch/sucrose metabolic pathway. the degs involved in carotenoid biosynthesis and bisphenol degradation were also significantly enriched . furthermore, about 30% of the co-regulated degs were unknowns or unannotated genes. they may play unique roles in response and adaptation to drought and cold environments of a. mongolicus.table  <dig>

differentially expressed genes specifically responding to drought or cold stress
in total,  <dig> and  <dig> degs were specifically regulated in at least one time point during drought or cold stress, respectively. of these degs,  <dig>  or  <dig>  had significant expression changes across all three time points under drought or cold stress, respectively. the top  <dig> drought- or cold-specific degs were listed in the additional files  <dig> and  <dig> 

among the  <dig> drought-specific degs,  <dig> degs encode tfs,  <dig> encode protein kinases and phosphatases, and  <dig> are involved in hormone or cell signaling. compared to the co-regulated degs, more tf gene families were found in the drought-specific degs. in the  <dig> cold-specific degs, however, fewer genes encode regulatory proteins. some distinct differences appeared between the drought- and cold-specific degs. for instance, genes encoding trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase and early responsive to dehydration protein were only found in the degs specifically up-regulated in drought; while genes encoding acidic endochitinase, protochlorophyllide reductase, protein chloroplast import apparatus  <dig> and chloroplast omega- <dig> fatty acid desaturase appeared only in the degs specifically up-regulated in cold. in addition, about  <dig> % of the drought-specific degs and  <dig> % of the cold-specific degs were functional unknowns.

the degs specifically up-regulated in drought were mostly enriched in the go terms “response to stress”, “response to stimulus”, “membrane” and “antioxidant activity” . however, the degs specifically up-regulated in cold were mostly enriched in the terms “aminoglycan catabolic process”, “plastid”, “chloroplast” and “pattern binding” . on the other hand, the degs specifically down-regulated in drought were more enriched in the go terms “small molecule biosynthetic process”, “organic acid biosynthetic process” and “iron ion binding” ; while the degs specifically down-regulated in cold were highly enriched in the go terms “lipid localization” and “antioxidant activity” . these results indicated that distinct molecular mechanisms were involved in a. mongolicus seedlings under drought compared to those in cold stress.

discussion
a. mongolicus is an emerging model species for studying the response and tolerance of plants to extreme cold and drought environments. by using illumina technology,  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated degs were previously identified in the cold-acclimated a. mongolicus seedlings  <cit> . using an est approach,  <dig> abiotic stress-responsive genes were identified in this species, and  <dig> genes were confirmed to be cold- and/or drought-inducible by qrt-pcr  <cit> . in the present study, we performed comparative transcriptome profiling of a. mongolicus in response to drought and cold and identified thousands of the degs regulated by each stress. in particular,  <dig> co-regulated degs by both stresses and about  <dig> degs specifically regulated by a single stress were identified, suggesting common and distinct molecular mechanisms underlying the response to drought and cold environments. these results were similar to those found in arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and brachypodium  <cit>  despite of some new information also observed in the present study. the co-regulated degs could represent a subset of basal drought and cold responsive genes in a. mongolicus and thus may play essential roles in its adaptation to adverse environments; while the specifically regulated degs might underline the distinct mechanisms of this species in response to different stresses. functional enrichment analyses of these degs provided clues to the molecular bases of a. mongolicus combating drought and cold environments.

flavonoids may contribute greatly to the adaptation of a. mongolicusto drought and cold environments
flavonoids constitute a large group of polyphenolic secondary metabolites in plants, which have antioxidant activity and are of prime importance for plant defense against pathogens and uv stress  <cit> . recent studies have showed that flavonoids accumulated to high levels in high alpine and polar plants  <cit>  and in a. mongolicus  <cit>  during cold acclimation, suggesting their important roles in cold adaptation of these plants. the biosyntheses of flavonoids require the enzymes involved in the general phenylpropanoid pathway and its flavonoid branch pathways, including phenylalanine ammonia-lyase , cinnamate-4-hydroxylase , 4-coumarate coa ligase , chalcone synthase , chalcone isomerase , chalcone reductase , flavanone 3-hydroxylase , dihydroflavonol-4-reductase , leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase , anthocyanidin synthase , isoflavone synthase , 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase , isoflavone reductase , isoflavone-3’-hydroxylase , flavonol synthase , o-methyltransferase  and udp-glycosyltransferase , etc  <cit> . in the present study, genes encoding almost all of these enzymes were not only moderately or highly expressed in a. mongolicus seedlings in normal condition , but also were significantly up-regulated by drought and cold stresses. go terms and pathways relevant to flavonoids were highly enriched in the co-up-regulated degs identified in both drought and cold stresses . the phenylpropanoid or flavonoid biosynthetic pathways are usually regulated by myb and/or bhlh tfs  <cit> . genes encoding these tfs were also included in the co-up-regulated degs identified in the present study. although their exact functions need to be characterized, our results suggest that genes involved in flavonoid biosyntheses may be crucial in the adaptation of a. mongolicus to drought and cold environments. an increased production of reactive oxygen species is a common consequence in plants under abiotic stresses, which usually damage cellular membranes and other cellular components resulting in oxidative stress and eventually cell death  <cit> . it is likely that a high level of flavonoids may protect a. mongolicus cells from oxidative stress originated from drought and cold, and hence they contribute to stress tolerance.

membrane proteins may play important roles in drought adaptation of a. mongolicus
in plants, membrane transport and perception systems have essential roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis under adverse environmental stresses through cell-to-cell and/or organ-to-organ communication  <cit> . an increased expression of multiple transporter and channel protein genes in response to drought has been found in some plant species  <cit> . over-expressing some of these genes, such as aquaporin ospip2- <dig>  <cit>  and abc-transporter atabcg <dig>  <cit> , enhanced plant tolerance to drought and/or salt stress. in the present study, the go term “membrane” was highly enriched in the degs up-regulated in drought , and approximately  <dig> membrane protein genes were found with up-regulation under drought stress. most of these genes were annotated to encode transporters and channel proteins, such as those for ions, sugars, organic acids, water, nitrate and phosphate, suggesting their involvement in drought adaptation of a. mongolicus.

receptor-like protein kinases , another group of membrane proteins, are important signaling components that mediate plant responses to developmental and environmental stimuli  <cit> . recent studies have shown that some rlks, such as arabidopsis rpk <dig>  ghr <dig> and atcrk <dig>  responded to drought, aba, salt and/or cold stresses and they were implicated in aba and br signaling pathways  <cit> . genes encoding cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases and lrr-rlks  were highly induced in chilling-treated chorispora bungeana  <cit> . in the present study, several rlk genes, such as those encoding lrr-rlks, lectin-like receptor kinase, leucine-rich repeat receptor-like tyrosine-protein kinase and g-type lectin s-receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase, were up-regulated in drought-stressed a. mongolicus seedlings. although their functions and detailed molecular mechanisms are not clear, an increased transcription of rlk genes suggests they may play important roles in drought adaptation of a. mongolicus.

chloroplast plays a central role in cold adaptation of a. mongolicus
physiological studies have confirmed that chloroplast plays a central role in plant cold acclimation and freezing tolerance, which acts as sensor of plants responding to cold and light stress as well as the target of many cold acclimation processes  <cit> . in the present study, genes related to chloroplast were specifically enriched in the degs up-regulated in cold , covering almost all aspects of chloroplast. the largest group of these genes was involved in photosynthesis, encoding chlorophyll a-b binding proteins, photosystem ii and photosystem i components, cytochrome b6/f complex subunit viii, thioredoxins, ribulose- <dig>  5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large and small subunits, as well as protochlorophyllide reductase and mg-chelatase. this result reinforced previous findings in woody or shrub plants with strong cold tolerance, including a. mongolicus  <cit> , rhododendron  <cit>  and populus euphratica  <cit> , in which several photosynthesis-related genes were up-regulated in cold acclimation. however, it was different from those observed in herbaceous plants like arabidopsis  <cit> , brachypodium  <cit> , barley  <cit>  and tomato  <cit> 
. in these plants with moderate cold tolerance or cold sensitivity, significant suppression of photosynthesis-related genes was observed under cold stress. an up-regulated transcription of the photosynthesis-related genes might be an important mechanism underlying the maintenance of normal or higher photosynthetic efficiency of a. mongolicus during extreme cold winter.

the second group of the up-regulated genes was annotated to encode early light-induced proteins , 20 kda chaperonin, chaperone protein dnaj  <dig>  protease do-like  <dig>  and lipoxygenase  <dig> . elips might protect chloroplasts from light-induced damage or photooxidative damage  <cit> . chaperonins or chaperone proteins participate in proper folding of protein substrates, protein disaggregation and degradation  <cit> . degp <dig> located in the thylakoid lumen  <cit>  is probably involved in the cleavage of photodamaged proteins. lox  <dig> is involved in the production of jasmonic acid and functions in biotic stress response  <cit> . to our knowledge, these genes  were firstly reported with up-regulation in a.mongolicus under cold stress.

two other chloroplast-related genes up-regulated in cold stress encode chloroplast omega- <dig> desaturase and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase. increasing evidence has indicated that both genes participate in the desaturation of fatty acids in chloroplast lipids and play crucial roles in cold response and tolerance  <cit> . an increased expression of these genes might help to maintain suitable fluidity and stability of chloroplast membranes of a. mongolicus in cold environment. the remaining chloroplast-related genes up-regulated under cold stress may have roles in protein import, ion transport, atp synthesis, starch degradation, protein synthesis and processing. all these genes could provide structural and physiological mechanisms for the protection of photosynthetic apparatus, and thus for extreme tolerance of a. mongolicus in very cold winter.

transcriptional regulatory network is involved in the adaptation of a. mongolicusto drought and cold environments
tfs are crucial components in stress signal transduction pathways, which directly control the expression of specific sets of stress-responsive genes  <cit> . of the a. mongolicus transcriptome, at least  <dig> tfs in  <dig> tf families were identified as degs during drought- and/or cold treatments, such as ap2/erebp, nac, wrky and bhlh families.

drebs and erfs  are two subfamilies in the ap2/erebp superfamily  <cit> . it is well-known that drebs play central roles in the regulation of cold- and drought-responsive genes and are important to the related stress tolerance in many plant species  <cit> . erfs have been recently found to participate in the response of plants to abiotic stresses, and some erfs can enhance drought, salt and/or freezing tolerance of their transgenic plants  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> derbs and  <dig> erfs were up-regulated in the drought- and cold-stressed a. mongolicus seedlings respectively, highlighting the importance of these tfs in the adaptation of this species to drought and cold environments.

the nac family is another group of tfs involved in the tolerance of plants to abiotic stresses, especially to drought and high salinity  <cit> . our study identified  <dig> putative nac genes up-regulated under drought and cold. similar results were obtained in the wrky family, a well-known family involved in biotic-stress tolerance in plants. recent evidence showed that the wrky family also functions in response to abiotic stresses  <cit> . our findings provide supports to these results, suggesting an important role of the nac and wrky families in drought and cold tolerance.

the myb, bhlh and c2h <dig> families are also involved in plant abiotic stress tolerance  <cit> . in the present study, different members of these families were either up- or down-regulated under drought and cold treatments. this differed obviously from the three tf families discussed earlier which were almost up-regulated during the stress treatments. in summary, sophisticated transcriptional regulation could participate in the adaptation of a. mongolicus to adverse environments, and several families, especially the ap2/erebp , nac and wrky families might be important in the processes.

CONCLUSIONS
a comprehensive transcriptome resource is generated for a. mongolicus and transcriptome profiles under drought and cold stresses are characterized. comparative transcriptome analysis identified many genes and pathways commonly or specifically regulated in the two stresses, implicating molecular basis of drought and cold tolerance in a. mongolicus. a number of drought- and cold-regulated genes were firstly identified in this study, including some unknown genes. these newly found genes could be important to a. mongolicus in combating extremely cold and drought environments in desert. our data will facilitate further molecular studies on stress tolerance of a. mongolicus and provide new insights into plant adaptation to harsh environments.
