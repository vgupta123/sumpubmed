BACKGROUND
almost all existing methods for comparing biological sequences are based on certain implicit  assumptions about the kinds of changes sequences undergo during their putative evolution. under these assumptions, some changes like permutations and inversions are often ignored  while other kinds of changes  are poorly evaluated because they do not follow regular evolutionary models. as a result, the regions in which these changes occur are often treated as ambiguous and are deleted from sequence alignments before further evolutionary analysis. in addition, as no single alignment method copes with tremendous variety of sequence data, expert editing  becomes often necessary. this is particularly important if the sequences have successive duplications/deletions  <cit> , and permutations.

to solve these problems, there has been work on methods of comparing sequences without alignments. an intuitive way of comparing sequences without alignments is to compare their compositions, i.e. the frequency of nucleotides or amino acids appearing in the sequences, as two sequences with significantly different compositions cannot be closely related. however, it is also true that two unrelated sequences can have very similar compositions. so the next step is to consider all n-words in a set of sequences  to calculate sequence dissimilarities  <cit> . this can show some evolutionary relationships. the problem is that the only straightforward relationship between two words is that they are either identical or different. this can be compensated by considering «imperfectly matched words». the problem is then a combinatorial explosion: as we all know, there are too many ways of being imperfect.

to track the evolutionary information embedded in ambiguous regions of sequence alignments and to alleviate the burden of manual editing, one of us developed a method that allows comparison by considering «local decoding of order n» of sequences , and keeping information of each set of overlapping  n-words that cover each site in a sequence  <cit> . the method is recapitulated in a recent work describing a new algorithm that computes the «local decoding of order n» of a sequence  with a complexity linear in sequence length, both in time and memory space  <cit> .

the method was found useful for assessing a manually constructed hiv  ltr  multiple alignment, which is homology blocks based  <cit> . «related sites» were found to correspond to homology blocks between compared sequences, leading us to think that the comparison of the sequences «composition» in «locally decoded letters» could yield a new method for calculating dissimilarities between sequences without an alignment and consequently without taking into account the order of homology blocks in each sequence.

the new method has also been tested against  <dig> reference alignment-based dissimilarity matrices calculated from  <dig> multiple alignments of dna or rna sequences: it gives alignment-free dissimilarities in very good agreement with the reference alignment-based dissimilarity matrices   <cit> .

the aims of this paper are:  to give a concise description of this new method   to apply it to a problem of biological interest, namely the classification of hiv/siv, two of the most variable organisms known so far .

RESULTS
the n-local decoding method on complete genome sequences – tests on hiv/siv complete sequences
the n-local decoding method was used to calculate dissimilarity matrices for all  <dig> sequences described in methods section. four incomplete genome sequences  were also included here because these sequences may have kept strong subtyping signals that are in the complete genome sequences. figure  <dig> shows a tree obtained from the dissimilarity matrices calculated by our method. two types of hiv, representing independent cross-species transmission events  <cit> , are clearly distinguished: hiv- <dig> is closer to siv-cpz, and hiv- <dig> is closer to siv-smm. nine subtypes of hiv- <dig> group m cluster distinctly, with sub-subtypes significantly more closely related to each other . subtype k is more distant from sub-subtypes f <dig> and f <dig> than these are from each other, but closer to f <dig> and f <dig> that to other subtypes, i.e., in the range of subtype b and d distances  <cit> . hiv- <dig> groups n and o are in the expected distances from the m group. the n group intercalates between hiv- <dig> group m and siv-cpz , consistent with a suggestion that group n is a recombinant between a siv-cpz strain and a virus related to the ancestor of group m  <cit> . the group o is intercalated between these cpz  and cpz-ant that is the borderline in the hiv-1/siv-cpz lineages  <cit> . hiv- <dig> subtypes also form clear clusters, respectively, including subtypes c, d, e, and f that are about half of gag region.

consequently, the topology of the tree shown in figure  <dig> agrees very well with existing knowledge  <cit>  and recognizes significant hiv/siv evolutionary events.

the computational program used to calculate the dissimilarity matrices from which the trees can be constructed has been tested for a wide range of values of n, which is the only user-specified parameter of the local decoding method. when n ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  there is no significant change in the tree. furthermore, the topology of the tree obtained by n-local decoding  of  <dig> hiv/siv complete nucleotide sequences, is identical with the complete genome tree available from hiv/siv sequence compendium  <dig>  and  <dig> hiv- <dig> sequences that cover partial gag  were tested. for other genome regions, pol ,env  and nef , only  <dig> sequences were selected because of unavailability of sequences in these regions from hiv- <dig> subtype c, d, e, f. the trees of these four regions, based on the n-local decoding calculated sequence distance matrices , also agree well with the established hiv/siv phylogenetic trees in these regions  <cit>  with the exception of nef. a few discrepancies exist in nef: in our method, hiv- <dig> group m sub-subtypes f <dig> and f <dig> mix together. subtype k, depending on the chosen value of n, either is still close to f1/f <dig> as expected, or is isolated or loosely related to subtype j. siv-cpz-ant is intermediary between hiv-1-m-n/siv-cpz-hiv-1-o and hiv-2/siv-smm. these discrepancies may simply reflect uneven sequence complexity in different genome regions, or just reflect the differences in treating ambiguous alignment regions: the n-local decoding method keeps all these regions while the traditional alignment-based methods have to delete those alignment regions in order to produce an unbiased tree.

the best orders n tested in these regions are: gag, n =  <dig> to 23; pol, n =  <dig> to 30; env, n =  <dig> to 24; and nef, n =  <dig> to  <dig> 

the n-local decoding method on sequences that traditional alignment-based methods cannot deal with – tests on non-coding ltr sequences
forty-three of the  <dig> sequences  cover the non-coding part of ltr . the length of this part ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> nt in the hiv-1/siv-cpz subset, and  <dig> to  <dig> nt in the hiv-2/siv-smm subset. these short non-coding ltr segments contain many duplications/insertions/deletions that make them difficult for traditional alignment-based phylogenic studies  <cit> .

there is no suitable reference tree available for this non-coding ltr region. thus we built trees based on clustal-w  <cit>  and dialign- <dig>  <cit>  alignments and compared them with the n-local-decoding-method-based tree. in our method , two types of hiv are very well characterized in terms of defining their relations to their siv origin . the sequence relations among different subtypes of hiv- <dig>  hiv- <dig>  and siv are clearly defined except for a <dig> and a <dig> that are not distinguishable from each other. clustal-w-based tree , however, incorrectly clusters hiv-1/siv-cpz, and hiv- <dig> m, n, o groups. in contrast, the tree based on dialign- <dig> , a multiple alignment program based on homology blocks, features better hiv clades than clustal-w-based tree. subtypes in hiv- <dig> and hiv- <dig> are well separated from each other. but this dialign-based tree is far less satisfactory than the n-local-decoding-method-based tree . for instance, sub-subtypes in hiv- <dig> group m mix together; hiv- <dig> group n is located inside hiv- <dig> group m and it is loosely related to siv-cpz; subtype a and g of hiv- <dig> group m are not closely related to each other as expected. in other words, neither clustal-w- nor dialign-based tree represent better hiv/siv sequence relations and distances than the tree obtained by our method.

in our method, bootstrap values strongly support the clustering of hiv- <dig> , siv-smm, hiv-1-m, hiv-1-n, siv-cpz, and hiv-1-o. however, in contrast to figure  <dig>  the values are low within hiv-1-m. this is not surprising since these sequences are short and very similar to each other. the parameter n tested here ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> in order to generate the most appropriate neighbor-joining trees for those  <dig> sequences. for various subtypes, however, this n sometimes falls into different ranges. for example, n = 9– <dig>  27– <dig> and even further make hiv- <dig> subtype c cluster clearly defined; n = 10– <dig> and beyond are needed for hiv- <dig> subtype g cluster; n = 8– <dig> and above are necessary to cluster two j sequences of hiv-1-group m. finally, n = 9– <dig> are needed to clearly cluster hiv-1-m/b and d subtype, and n = 19– <dig> are necessary to distinguish hiv- <dig> subtype b and d.

in short, our hiv/siv subtyping results confirmed the good performance of the n-local-decoding method, regardless the complexity of genome regions. the n values listed above not only are useful in making an n-parameter reference for future n-local-decoding method applications, but also imply different evolutionary pressures in various hiv/siv clades.

similarity blocks displayed by the n-local decoding method – an example of the hiv non-coding ltr sequences
in our previous study of hiv ltr  <cit> , a sequence alignment had to be manually constructed in order to take into account the frequent duplications/insertions/deletions events. this strategy is similar to the n-local-decoding procedure described in this paper.

here we use the hiv non-coding-ltr nfkb binding site   and its flanking sequences obtained from  <dig> sequences  as an example to show the relationship between the similarity blocks and the n-classes.

 similarity blocks in the nfkb binding sites reveal different duplication events of this site in various hiv clades. each hiv- <dig> group m subtype has two nfkb site copies, with the exception of subtype c which exhibits an extra ≥ 10-letter long fragment cgttcca) with  <dig> letters  matching this nfkb site. both hiv- <dig> group n sequences have two nfkb binding sites and one or two incomplete copy of such site , and these n-group sequences are more similar to siv-cpz and hiv-1-m than to other hiv clades. all hiv- <dig> group o sequences display two copies of a sequence fragment of  <dig> letters long . each fragment includes a nfkb binding site, a segment g2a3c2a <dig> similar to that in hiv- <dig> subtype b, and a segment c3t#g#c <dig> similar to siv-cpz-gab. the differences in the similarity blocks in nfkb binding sites in hiv clades may indicate an important role the nfkb binding site played in different independent introductions of siv-cpz from chimpanzees into the human populations to establish hiv- <dig> m, n, o groups.

 similarity blocks in nfkb site flanking sequences may also provide helpful information in tracking evolutionary relationships and distances between hiv clades. one example is the pattern g#c5a <dig> before the nfkb site, that only exists in hiv- <dig> and siv-smm sequences. possibly this well-preserved g#c5a <dig> participated actively in the cross-transmission from smm to human to establish the hiv- <dig>  the other example is a <dig> a# g# g# g# pattern  at the 3' end of hiv- <dig> subtype a flanking sequences. this pattern distinguishes hiv- <dig> subtype a from other hiv clades. this, again, may simply reflect different transmission influences in varied hiv clades.

discussion
the current hiv sequence analyses usually involve obtaining a gap-stripped multiple alignment to construct an unbiased phylogenetic tree. the alignment usually is first generated by hmmer perfect repeats or conserved regions in sequences . the similarity blocks include internal repeats in one sequence or conserved regions among sequences, and these blocks are not necessarily to appear in the same order in the original sequences. in our method, the inversion could be detected by including the reverse complementary sequences in the sequence set.

this method is also practically applicable in terms of computing time and convenience to use. all the calculations in this paper have been done within a few seconds on a regular pc. the quality of the algorithm  <cit>  is responsible for this speed. this algorithm has a complexity linear in the total length of the set.

the n value, the only parameter used in this method, could be set empirically according to the n values listed in the results section.

our method thus provides an alternative way of constructing sequence trees. it is helpful in tracking sequence information embedded in ambiguous alignment regions. in addition, the possibility of comparing sequences of varied lengths also suggests its direct use in detecting sequence recombinants. finally, the similarity blocks found by this method could also be used as the anchor points for those similarity-block-based alignment programs to refine the quality of the alignment.

CONCLUSIONS
the n-local-decoding method has shown its satisfactory applications in hiv/siv subtyping. the deduced classifications are in good agreement with our best taxonomic knowledge, even for non-coding ltr regions that are not tractable by regular alignment methods due to frequent duplications/insertions/deletions. however, its application is not limited in hiv/siv subtyping. in general, the advantages of this method are:

1) it generates sequence dissimilarity matrices without requiring sequence alignments.

2) it has only one user-specified parameter .

3) it is fast.

thus the n-local-decoding method provides a promising approach to the rapid construction of trees without a time-consuming step of aligning sequences.
