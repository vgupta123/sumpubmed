BACKGROUND
the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, or prion diseases, are fatal neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the accumulation of a post-translationally modified variant of the host coded prion protein . until recently, only one form of naturally occurring cattle prion disease was recognized. however, extensive testing of sheep and cattle destined for the human food chain have recently revealed the presence of hitherto unsuspected variant forms of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy of cattle  <cit>  and also of sheep  <cit> .

idiopathic brainstem neuronal chromatolysis and hippocampal sclerosis  is a disorder of adult cattle which has some clinical similarity to bovine spongiform encephalopathy  <cit> . it was initially recognised from histological examination of cattle brains submitted as part of the uk statutory reporting of bse suspects  <cit> . the disease is rare. in the period from  <dig> to <dig> it occurred at a rate of  <dig> cases per  <dig>  beef suckler cows over the age of  <dig> years and  <dig>  cases per  <dig>  dairy cows of the same age  <cit> . the mean age of onset is  <dig> years with a range of  <dig> –  <dig> years. most cases have been reported in scotland and cases have also been diagnosed in england and wales, but not from outside the uk. most cases of ibnc occur singly on farms, but two farms have been identified which have experienced two cases each . the proportion of ibnc cases detected through the early 1990s was relatively consistent at 12–14% per year of the bse negative case subset. during the peak of the bse epidemic,  <dig> ibnc cases were recognized in scotland in one year . ibnc cases continued to be found in recent years but there has been a fall in absolute numbers within the bse negative subset. at least some ibnc cases have distinguishing clinical features from bse  <cit>  and the fall in histological diagnosis of ibnc cases may be a reflection of an increasingly critical appraisal of clinical signs when suspect bse cases are examined in the field.

the pathological lesions of ibnc are distinctive and characterised by four types of histological change  <cit> . neuronal degeneration and axonal degeneration involving brainstem and cranial nerve nuclei and radices of cranial nerves, accompanied by a non-suppurative inflammation proportionate to the degenerative changes, are invariably present. in approximately half the cases examined there is a spongiform change involving grey matter of medial and lateral geniculate nuclei, thalamus, hippocampus, striatum and cerebral cortex, together with hippocampal degeneration and sclerosis involving extensive loss of neurons  <cit> . the spongiform changes of ibnc involve neuroanatomical areas different from those vacuolated in bse affected brains.

testing for a number of different metabolic disorders, including vitamin b, vitamin e and selenium deficiency, the presence of antigens to louping ill virus, aujeszky's disease virus, borna virus and bovine virus diarrhoea virus failed to show any significant abnormalities . immunohistochemical studies for prp were initially performed in the mid-1990s on ibnc brain tissues using antibodies raised to murine prp. no abnormal prp was detected. five brains were tested for scrapie associated fibrils by negative stain electron microscopy and were negative .

prp immunohistochemistry tests on brains from ibnc cases performed during the 1990s were done using antibodies of low affinity for bovine prp and methodologies that are of lower sensitivity than those currently available. recent re-examination of tissues from ibnc cases using more sensitive labelling methods and antibodies capable of detecting lower levels of bovine prp, consistently revealed prp labelling in all cases tested. this present report describes the results of immunohistochemical and biochemical methods for prp detection in a series of ibnc cases.

methods
sixteen cases of ibnc were retrieved from the pathology archives at the vla lasswade laboratory. cases were from cattle that were between  <dig> and  <dig> years of age when killed between  <dig> and  <dig>  to control for inflammatory and degenerative changes and time of tissue preservation in paraffin wax, cases of malignant catarrhal fever, , encephalic listeriosis, non-suppurative encephalitis, bse and also, cattle brains with no significant morphological changes were also retrieved from the same archive. these latter cases had also been preserved in paraffin wax since 1992– <dig> 

tissues of ibnc cases available for immunohistochemistry and, or, biochemistry are listed in table  <dig>  for histology and immunohistochemical testing, whole brains were available from  <dig> ibnc cases: representative samples of medulla at the obex and cerebellar peduncles, midbrain, thalamus, striatum, cerebellum hippocampus and cereberal cortices were examined. from a single cow, additional tissues of eye, spleen, adrenal gland and lymph node were also examined. from the remaining seven cases only brainstem was available for testing.

the protocol for sampling suspect bse cases has altered in the uk over time. consequently, most ibnc cases from the early part of the epidemic lacked samples of frozen tissue for biochemical analyses. from the later part of the epidemic, only medulla was available for biochemical testing: from  <dig> whole brains have been routinely frozen and retained. samples of frozen brain were available from  <dig> cases on which a diagnosis of ibnc was established, based on the histology of medulla. from only one ibnc brain was half a brain available for biochemistry and half a brain available for histology. the tissues available for examination are listed in table  <dig> 

histology and immunohistochemistry
all brain sections available were stained with haematoxylin and eosin. additional blocks of tissue of medulla, midbrain and thalamus were impregnated with silver according to glees and marsland's modification of davenport's method for degenerate axons.

for immunohistochemistry, paraffin wax embedded tissues were sectioned at  <dig> μm, mounted on treated glass slides  and dried overnight at 37°c. initially, immunohistochemistry carried out in 1993– <dig> on ibnc cases used the 1b <dig> antibody, a polyclonal antibody which had been raised in rabbits to scrapie associated fibrils extracted from me <dig> infected mouse brain. methods used for epitope demasking employed only a formic-acid retrieval stage and did not use autoclaving. subsequently, in  <dig>  immunohistochemistry was carried out as described by gonzález et al  <cit> . briefly, antigen retrieval included immersion of tissue sections in 98% formic acid for  <dig> min and autoclaving in  <dig> % citrate buffer for  <dig> min at 121°c. after two blocking steps , incubation with the primary antibody was carried out overnight at 4°c. subsequent steps were performed using a commercial immunoperoxidase technique , after which sections were immersed in  <dig> % copper sulphate, to enhance immunoperoxidase colour reaction. finally, sections were counterstained with mayer's haematoxylin. seven prp antibodies were used, all of which were first titrated on bse infected sheep or cattle brains to determine the effective dilution range. the antibodies, their binding or eliciting sequences, and dilutions used are shown in table  <dig>  all of these antibodies are considerably more sensitive for detecting bovine prp than were antibodies used for ibnc labelling in 1993– <dig>  biotinylated antibodies were used for secondary enhancement: goat anti-rat was used to detect antibody r <dig> and a universal horse anti-mouse/rabbit was used to detect all other antibodies. for antibody controls, omission of the primary antibody and anti-isotype antibodies were also employed.

biochemical methods
tesee western blotting
sample extraction was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions  tesee western blot) with several modifications. in brief, brain tissue was ribolysed to give a 20%  homogenate. the homogenate was then incubated with dnaase  at room temperature for  <dig> minutes. the samples were then digested with  <dig>  units/ml proteinase k );  <dig>  units/ml is an in-house nomenclature and equivalent to  <dig>  μl of bio-rad test proteinase k in terms of activity when compared with the tame test  or  <dig> μl/ml proteinase k  for  <dig> minutes, with digestion stopped by adding 1/ <dig> pefabloc sc  . following precipitation and centrifugation at  <dig>  g for  <dig> minutes, the pellets were incubated at 100°c for  <dig> minutes in  <dig> μl laemmli solution  beta-mercaptoethanol and 2%  sds). a second centrifugation was performed at  <dig>  g for  <dig> min. the supernatants were stored frozen at -20°c overnight. for analysis, the supernatants were heated at 100°c for  <dig> minutes, loaded on a 12% criterion xt bis-tris sds gel  and subjected to electrophoresis in nupage running buffer  at  <dig> v for  <dig> minutes. proteins were transferred to a pvdf membrane  at  <dig> v for  <dig> min using nupage transfer buffer.

blots to be exposed to the sha <dig> antibody were blocked for one hour with the solution provided by the manufacturers. where antibodies f <dig>  saf <dig> and p <dig> were used, a blocking buffer of 5% milk powder in pbs supplemented with tween  <dig>  was used. the membranes were incubated for one hour with the primary antibody: either sha <dig>  1/ <dig> dilution in pbst, saf <dig>   <dig>  μg/ml, p <dig>   <dig>  μg/ml, or f <dig>  <dig> μg/ml . the membranes were incubated with goat anti-mouse igg antibody  conjugated to horseradish peroxidase diluted 1/ <dig> in pbst. the membranes were visualized by chemiluminescence .

for the  <dig> μl/ml proteinase k concentration the addition of dnaase and pefabloc was omitted.

elisa for determination of prpres
20% homogenates were prepared as for the western blot using the bio-rad protocol with the modifications described. the pellets obtained were solubilised by incubating at 100°c for  <dig> minutes in reagent c. the method for the elisa was carried out as described by the manufacturers. the absorbance was measured at  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm.

eia for determination of aggregated prp using a ligand based diagnostic test
for the determination of aggregated prp in the absence of proteinase k the idexx  herdchek bse test was performed on samples according to the manufacturer's instructions with no modifications or deviations. briefly samples were mixed with the working plate diluents and then loaded on a bse antigen-capture eia plate and incubated for  <dig>  hours at room temperature. aggregated prp was observed using the conjugated anti-prp antibodies provided with the kit. absorbance was read at  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm.

determination of positive values
the cut-off values for the bio-rad tesee elisa and idexx assays were calculated using the mean of the absorbance values of  <dig> confirmed bse negative brainstem samples+  <dig> standard deviations. this value was calculated as  <dig>  absorbance units  for the tesee elisa and  <dig>  au for the idexx assay. mean absorbance value and standard deviation using  <dig>  μ/ml proteinase k for the bio-rad assay was  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and for the herdchek assay  <dig>  ±  <dig>  .

RESULTS
the histology of each ibnc case was reviewed and the lesions seen were as previously described . severe brainstem neuronal chromatolysis , often accompanied by nuclear degeneration and occasional amphophilic, intranuclear inclusions, was present in several brainstem nuclei, being consistently present in the red nucleus, vestibular complex, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagal nerve and raphe. in addition, there was severe axonal and myelin degeneration, prominently affecting the radices and roots of cranial nerves . the degenerative changes of neurons were accompanied by marked gliosis of parallel severity, and proceeding to gemistocytosis and non-suppurative inflammation of meninges and perivascular spaces. marked spongiform change with neuronal degeneration was present in the midbrain, thalamus, striatum and cortex. not fully described in previous papers are the different patterns of vacuolation found in ibnc. three patterns of vacuolation were recognized: firstly a large loculated  vacuole typically found in the betz cell layer of the cerebral cortex  and also in the thalamus. single or multiple, round or ovoid, grey matter vacuoles of a form and character similar to that of scrapie or bse were present in the midbrain, thalamus and striatum. these lesions were not present in medulla and were specifically absent from bse target sites. thalamic vacuoles were sometimes focally very numerous and sometimes associated with neuronal degeneration. these two forms of vacuolation were present in  <dig> of  <dig> cases where whole brain was available for examination. a third vacuolar change, in which the neuropil was pale and showed a diffuse lacy appearance or very small vacuoles was also found . sub-total loss of ca <dig> and ca <dig> pyramidal neurons and neurons of the dentate gyrus, was present in  <dig> of the  <dig> brains where hippocampus samples were available for examination . no significant morphological lesions were recognised in eye or viscera.

the effective operating dilution for each of the antibodies was determined for bse affected sheep or cattle brains and is listed in table  <dig>  the efficiency of each antibody for detection of disease specific prp found in cattle bse differed with f <dig>  6c <dig>  saf <dig> and 12f <dig> all producing high intensity labelling. prp labelling of sections from ibnc cases was obtained with all antibodies but the ranking of sensitivity of detection of prp in ibnc cases and disease specific prp in cattle bse cases was not the same. in particular 6c <dig>  which give strong labelling of disease specific prp accumulations in bse affected cattle, gave weak labelling in ibnc cases. f <dig> and saf <dig> labeled some 'dark' neurons in control brains tissues and f <dig> produces some weak, diffuse neuropil labelling. all other antibodies were 'clean' with no background staining. ibnc cases showed a distinctive pattern of prp labelling that was present in sections of all ibnc cases but was absent from brains of all infectious or inflammatory conditions, brains with no significant lesions and brains from bse cases. the same staining patterns were found in material which had been preserved in wax or in fixative for widely differing time intervals; it was reproduced in replicate staining runs and identical patterns were found with different antibodies. thus, we consider that this labelling represents an abnormal form of prp labelling. however, immunohistochemical methods alone do not reveal whether such accumulations are due to increased expression or altered distribution of normal forms of the protein, or whether they are prp accumulations that are abnormal in conformation or aggregation, as they are in bse and other prion diseases.

prp labelling was detected in all ibnc cases though not in every case at all sites examined . f <dig>  saf <dig> and l <dig> antibodies gave the greatest amounts of labelling. in most cases labelling was widespread throughout the brain. in three cases labelling was more or less confined to the striatum and in one of these three, the labelling was restricted to the putamen. he stained sections of these three cases did not show any large loculated neuropil vacuoles. all other cases gave a wide distribution of labelling including medulla, cerebellum, midbrain, thalamus, striatum, hippocampus and cerebrum. in brainstem sections, labelling was present in the spinal tract nucleus of the trigeminal nerve and in the cerebellum, most labelling involved the cerebellar molecular layer.

na tissue or data not available

most prp labelling was found in grey matter  in the form of globular, ring or in 'c' shaped patterns . occasionally, several of these were arranged in a line. very often this pattern of labelling was present at the rim of small vacuoles . some bundles of white matter in which there was strong vacuolation at the grey matter interface were also strongly prp labelled at this interface with the above pattern. the intensity of prp labelling was greatest in those cases in which lesions of degeneration and spongiform change were most marked. when the sites of labelling were compared with he stained sections this pattern of labelling corresponded to the 'lacy' neuropil type of micro-vacuolation, both in specific location within individual sections and in overall brain distribution. the larger loculated or foamy forms of vacuoles and more typical scrapie like vacuoles were not specifically labelled.

in the cerebellum of two cases diffuse labelling was found in the granular layer and neuropil between granule cell neuronal nuclei . diffuse labelling of both inner and outer plexiform layers was found in the one eye  examined but no labelling was found in the limited range of viscera. rarely, degenerate chromatolytic neurons showed intracytoplasmic labelling .

biochemistry
from  <dig> all cattle taken under the bse regulations were routinely tested by the biorad elisa. the records of  <dig> ibnc cases from within this period were located. all results were recorded as negative. repeat testing of samples using standard commercial biorad and idexx test kits also gave negative results.

the results of biorad tests using reduced levels of proteinase k are shown in table  <dig>  of the total of  <dig> ibnc samples of different brain sites tested,  <dig>  gave values above those of the test kit negative control and also above the bse negative brain pool control. seven of these samples  were above the calculated cut off value. values above and up to  <dig> times greater than the calculated cut off were found for each case but not for each brain site. individual samples from two brains  which did not initially show results above the calculated cut off values did so on re-testing .

values in bold are above the calculated cut off.

western blots were carried out on the samples shown in table  <dig>  in each case no residual protease resistant prp  was found when  <dig> or  <dig> μl/ml of proteinase k was used. when  <dig>  μl/ml or  <dig>  μl/ml of proteinase k was used, a signal was detected on the blots of all samples including those of the negative controls. ibnc samples were indistinguishable from negative controls with digestions of  <dig>  μl/ml proteinase k. however, when  <dig>  μl/ml of proteinase k was used more residual prp was detected in ibnc cases than in the controls  and with each of the antibodies tested .

discussion
this study shows that the novel condition of cattle previously identified as ibnc and recognized from within the bse suspect submissions, abnormally expresses or accumulates prp in brain and retina. however, this abnormal prp is not composed of isoforms that are strongly resistant to protease digestion suggesting that it is not present in the form of large aggregates.

immunohistochemical demonstration of prp labelling and increased levels of prp mrna have previously been described in adult humans affected with acute vascular disorders, in infants with perinatal hypoxia and experimental infarction of rodents  <cit> . these findings are considered to represent upregulation of prp expression which encompasses part of the oxidative stress response of neurons. we have also observed increased prp in the cytoplasm of neurons undergoing ischaemic degeneration in a variety of sheep encephalopathies. though ischaemic neuronal degeneration is not a feature of ibnc, nevertheless, the presence of prp within the cytoplasm of some chromatolytic and degenerate neurons of ibnc affected cattle is consistent with the idea that stressed neurons may respond by increasing prp expression.

though present in only two cows, the pattern of prp accumulation within the granule cell layer of the cerebellum is morphologically similar to that reported by several authors for nor  <dig> types of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathy or prion disease of sheep  <cit> . the prp accumulation within the plexiform layers of the eye is similar to that of both natural scrapie  <cit>  and of nor  <dig> . however the majority type of prp labelling that occurred in all ibnc cases was found within the neuropil, mainly in the rostral neuraxis and cerebrum, the nature of which is previously unreported in cattle or in any other prion disorder. this novel pattern of labelling appears to correspond to a rarefaction or fine microvacuolation of neuropil as seen on standard he stained sections.

pathological, biochemical and bioassay data all suggest that the epidemic form of cattle bse is a single strain. however, recent large scale eu wide surveillance for bse has led to the unexpected discovery of rare and hitherto unknown prion diseases of cattle. small numbers of atypical forms of cattle prion diseases have now been recognized from several european countries, in the usa and japan and can be distinguished by histological, molecular and transmission characteristics  <cit> . bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy  was the first of these novel cattle prion disorders to be recognized and was characterized by the presence of numerous small amyloid deposits of abnormal prp. it was initially discovered in three aged italian cattle  <cit>  and has subsequently been transmitted to transgenic mice  <cit> . a further variant of a cattle prion disease affecting cows between  <dig> and  <dig> years was initially recognized in france  <cit>  and has also been transmitted to mice. bse and these novel cattle prion diseases can be distinguished using biochemical and molecular methods and are now classified as c, h and l type isolates  <cit> . h type and l type  isolates are defined according to the higher and lower positions of the unglycosylated prpres bands in western blots, respectively, when compared to the position of the corresponding band in classical bse  isolates  <cit> . l type cases formerly classified as base, have a distinctive glycopattern in which monoglycoslyated prpres predominates compared to bse  <cit> . while ibnc cases are on average older than bse cases they occupy a similar age class of cattle to that of h and l type cattle prion diseases, but ibnc can be readily distinguished from h, l and c type cattle prion disease by morphologic pathology and by the absence of prpres under stringent conditions of protease digestion.

not all abnormal prpres isoforms detected from brains of animals affected with prion disease are resistant to stringent protease digestion. the prpres of two sheep of the arr/arr prp genotype affected with a classical scrapie-like disease accumulated unusually protease sensitive isoforms of prp  <cit> . similarly, the transmissible prion disease of sheep known as nor  <dig> and related conditions  also have weakly protease resistant prpres  <cit> . nor  <dig> does not appear to transmit readily to other sheep under field conditions: it also does not transmit to conventional mice although it does readily transmit disease to one strain of transgenic mouse which substantially over-expresses the vrq allele of sheep prp  <cit> . the transgenic pg <dig> mouse also has prpres which is even more readily digested than that found in nor  <dig> but this prion protein disorder has not so far been successfully transmitted  <cit> . the biochemical analyses of limited numbers of ibnc cases clearly shows that highly aggregated forms of protease resistant prp are not present in brain tissue. however, when the data from the elisa and immunoblot tests using mild protease digestion are compared with that of normal control material it is possible that smaller aggregates of prp molecules may be present.

CONCLUSIONS
the present results indicate that there are changes in prp expression or accumulation in the neurodegenerative cattle disorder known as ibnc. the pathology and biochemistry of ibnc are quite distinct from that of other prion diseases of cattle and other species but the pathology does include grey matter spongiform changes. the transmissibility of this disorder is undetermined. these results are interesting as they show that either the range of prion diseases and associated pathology is still wider than previously thought or that substantial abnormalities of prion protein expression may be associated with brain lesions unconnected with classical prion diseases. further biochemical and transmission studies are needed to determine which of these possibilities is correct.
