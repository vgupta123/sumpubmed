BACKGROUND
phloem feeding insects, which includes aphids, whiteflies, psyllids and planthoppers, feed solely on phloem sap, which contains high concentrations of sucrose . utilizing sucrose as its main respiratory substrate the pea aphid, acyrthosiphon pisum, catabolizes  <dig> - 30% of its ingested sucrose in oxidative pathways. a larger proportion, close to 50% of the ingested sucrose, is incorporated into aphid tissues  <cit> . while sucrose is the main carbon source for a. pisum, sucrose itself is not transported across the gut epithelium  <cit> . instead sucrose is hydrolyzed in the gut lumen by an α-glucosidase to its constituent monosaccharides, glucose and fructose , and these hexose sugars are transported. although sugar transport plays a critical role in aphid nutrition, the molecular basis of sugar transport in phloem feeding insects is poorly characterized. in this study, we address this knowledge gap by testing our prediction that a. pisum uses facilitative transporters belonging to the major facilitator superfamily for hexose sugar transport.

the major facilitator superfamily , one of the largest transporter superfamilies, currently contains  <dig> families, with each family specific for a group of compounds  <cit> . within the mfs, sugars are transported by sugar porter family transporters . the sugar porter family is essentially ubiquitous and found throughout the tree of life. currently, our best insight into sugar porter function comes from detailed structure and function analyses of human transporters . human sugar porter family transporters  contain  <dig> members, which are grouped according to their sequence similarity . by far the best-described are glut class i transporters  and glut class ii transporters , which mediate equilibrative, energy independent membrane transport of hexose sugars down their concentration gradient. glut class iii transporters  are more recently discovered, as a result of the sequencing of the human genome, and their function is less well-described  <cit> . predominant sugars transported by human gluts include glucose, galactose, fructose, and myoinositol .

previously, using the initial release of the a. pisum genome sequence   <cit>  we identified an expanded family of major facilitator superfamily sugar transporters  <cit> . the most highly expressed sugar transporter  was named a. pisum transporter  <dig> . apst <dig> is globally highly expressed in insect tissues and is enriched  <dig> -fold in gut tissues, relative to whole insect expression levels  <cit> . functionally, apst <dig> is a low affinity fructose  and low affinity glucose  facilitative transporter  <cit> . in a related study by kikuta et al.,  <dig> putative sugar transporters were identified in phloem feeding insect, the rice brown planthopper, nilaparvata lugens. of these,  <dig> transporters were highly expressed at the gut interface compared to whole insect levels  <cit> . the n. lugens ortholog of apst <dig>  designated n. lugens sugar transporter  <dig>  has 43% amino acid sequence identity and 60% sequence similarity to apst <dig>  transporter nlst <dig> is enriched ~9-fold in gut tissues, relative to whole insect expression levels and has an uptake profile similar to apst <dig>  transporting both glucose and fructose  <cit> . based on gene expression pattern, and substrate selectivity, it likely that a. pisum apst <dig> and the n. lugens ortholog nlst <dig> import glucose and fructose at the gut interface and contribute to carbon nutrition in these phloem feeding insects.

here, in an effort to more thoroughly describe the extent of a. pisum sugar transport at the gut interface we utilize a genome-wide approach to identify sugar transporters and screen for glucose and fructose transport function. in this study, using a de novo approach we identify  <dig> sugar porter family transporters in the latest release a. pisum genome . gene expression analysis reveals that  <dig> of these sugar porter family transporters  are highly expressed at the a. pisum gut interface. when functionally expressed in saccharomyces cerevisiae hexose transport deletion mutant  only apst <dig>  and apst <dig>  functionally rescue the hexose transport mutant. we report here the detailed functional characterization of a. pisum sugar transporter  <dig> . apst <dig> is a facilitative glucose and fructose transporter that is structurally, functionally and phylogenetically related to mammalian glut class i transporters . apst <dig> is globally highly expressed throughout the aphid, enriched  <dig> -fold in gut tissues relative to whole insect expression levels, and transports glucose and fructose with high affinity.

RESULTS
the a. pisum genome contains a large family of sugar porters
the latest release of the a. pisum genome  contains  <dig> sugar porter family transporters that match the tigrfams sugar porter motif . all gene annotations are presented in additional file 1: table s <dig>  gene expression analysis, based on  <dig>   <dig> a. pisum expressed sequence tags  supports  <dig> of these sugar porter family transporters being expressed in mixed population adult a. pisum. the two remaining transporters  are not represented in the a. pisum expressed sequence tag  dataset, suggesting that they are not expressed or only expressed at very low levels. one of the expressed transporters, apst <dig>  is only represented by male ests, suggesting that this transporter is male-specific.

the complement of sugar porter family transporters in other insect species included in our analysis  ranges between  <dig> –  <dig>  comparatively, with  <dig> predicted sugar porter family transporters, a. pisum contains a large family of sugar porters. only the red flour beetle, t. castaneum, with  <dig> sugar porter family transporters, encodes a larger number of transporters .

a. pisum sugar porters are highly expressed at the gut interface
quantitative gene expression analysis of a. pisum sugar porter family transporters reveals that four transporters: apst <dig>  acypi004204; apst <dig>  acypi001980; apst <dig>  acypi001077; and apst <dig>  acypi <dig>  are highly expressed in adult females. sugar porter family transporter expression is ranked apst3 > apst9 > apst4 > apst <dig>  in adult females, with the expression of all transporters above our >10% gapdh expression cut-off level . notably, three of these transporters  are also the most highly expressed sugar porter transporters in a. pisum gut tissue. a fourth transporter apst <dig>  acypi <dig>  is expressed at low levels in whole insects , and is highly expressed  in a. pisum gut tissue . based on their differing expression profiles we can divide these four gut-expressed sugar porter family transporters into two groups; the first group includes apst <dig>  which has a strongly gut-bias expression pattern  . the second group contains transporters apst <dig>  apst <dig> and apst <dig> that are universally highly expressed in whole adult female a. pisum and all tissues analyzed including embryos, heads and guts . as well as being globally highly expressed, transporters apst <dig> and apst <dig> are enriched in gut tissue  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold, respectively, compared to whole insect expression levels . although highly expressed in all tissues analyzed, transporter apst <dig> is not enriched in gut tissue, relative to whole insect expression levels .figure  <dig>

a. pisum gut expressed sugar porters transport hexose sugars
all four a. pisum gut expressed sugar transporters  were screened for hexose transport activity by functional complementation of the saccharomyces cerevisiae hexose-uptake deficient strain eby.vw <dig>  <cit> .

apst <dig>  a low affinity fructose/glucose transporter  <cit>  was used as a positive control, and run alongside the functional screen of apst <dig>  apst <dig> and apst <dig>  yeast cells transformed with either apst <dig> , apst <dig>  apst <dig> or apst <dig> expression constructs produced recombinant aphid transporter protein, which was detected in yeast total membrane fractions by anti-myc antibodies in western blots . all aphid sugar transporters reported here  were detected below their calculated molecular weight when expressed in yeast . the anomalous migration of transmembrane transporters on sds-page gels is attributed to the hydrophobic properties of the protein  <cit> . immunoreactivity was not present in negative control cells that were transformed with an empty pdr <dig> expression construct . although all a. pisum transporters were expressed, only apst <dig>  and apst <dig> were able to restore eby.vw <dig> growth on minimal media containing glucose, fructose, galactose and mannose as the sole carbon source . importantly, negative control yeast cells  were unable to grow on minimal media plates containing these sugars . these results show that transporters apst <dig>  and apst <dig> are functional hexose transporters that mediate the efficient transport of hexose sugars across the yeast plasma membrane.figure  <dig>

saccharomyces cerevisiae hexose transport mutant eby.vw <dig> was transformed with a. pisum gut expressed sugar transporters apst <dig>  apst <dig> and apst <dig>  positive control cells  were transformed with apst <dig>  <cit>  and negative control  cells were transformed with empty expression vector. yeast cell suspensions containing 10 μl of  <dig>  1/ <dig> and 1/ <dig> od <dig> units were plated on minimal media containing 60 mm sugars  as the sole carbon source. recovery of mutant yeast growth was observed after 3-days at 30°c.



apst <dig> is a facilitative hexose transporter
apst <dig> is a broad-spectrum hexose transporter. substrate competition  experiments with a 2-molar excess  of unlabeled competing sugar, demonstrate that glucose, mannose, fructose and galactose significantly reduce 14c fructose uptake into yeast cells expressing apst <dig> . apst <dig> efficiently binds glucose > mannose > fructose, all reducing 14c-fructose uptake by > 50% compared to control uptake with no competing sugar. galactose also competes with fructose uptake, but less efficiently, only reducing 14c-fructose uptake by ~21% compared to control uptake with no competing sugar . competition assays with alcohol sugars: myo-inositol, sorbitol and mannitol revealed these do not compete with 14c-fructose uptake, and are therefore not recognized substrates . in summary, functional complementation assays  and competition  assays  are consistent with apst <dig> functioning as a broad-spectrum hexose transporter.figure  <dig>

major facilitator superfamily  transporters function as either facilitative transporters or secondary active transporters. facilitative transporters  mediate passive  solute transport across membranes, moving solutes along their concentration gradients with no energy expenditure. in contrast, secondary active transporters  couple solute transport with monovalent cation  transport. symporters require an electrochemical membrane potential to drive transport, allowing solutes to accumulate against their concentration gradient  <cit> . apst <dig> transports glucose over a wide extracellular ph range, between ph  <dig>  and  <dig>   and pre-treatment of yeast cells expressing apst <dig> with proton ionophores carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone  and  <dig> -dinitrophenol  does not significantly reduce glucose transport compared to untreated control cells . furthermore, there was no significant effect on apst <dig> transport activity when nacl in the transport buffer was substituted with choline chloride . our data demonstrates that apst <dig> is a facilitated hexose transporter  that functions independently of the electrochemical membrane potential.

glucose and fructose uptake by apst <dig> is concentration dependent, with transport rates saturating at high substrate concentrations, yielding an estimated km of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm for glucose and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm for fructose .figure  <dig>

apst <dig> shares sequence features with mammalian glut facilitative transporters
apst <dig>  was reconstructed from sequence reads ff <dig> and ff <dig>  present in the a. pisum full-length cdna resource  <cit> . apst <dig> comprises of a 403 bp 5′ utr, a 1476 bp coding sequence and a 185 bp 3′ utr that contains a putative polyadenylation signal  22 bp upstream from the poly-a tail. apst <dig> contains  <dig> exons that map to a  <dig>  kbp region of scaffold  <dig>  from a. pisum genomic scaffolds of assembly acyr  <dig> . expression data retrieved from ncbis dbest, shows that apst <dig> is expressed in all a. pisum sexual morphs including males , sexual oviparous females  and asexual females . partial sequence orthologs of apst <dig> are present in the green peach aphid, myzus persicae ; cotton aphid, aphis gossypii  and brown citrus aphid, toxoptera citricida .

apst <dig> is phylogenetically related to mammalian glut transporters
the phylogenetic position of apst <dig> was investigated by comparison with related transporters from humans and other insects. insect taxa, including n. lugens, t. castaneum, a. melifera, d. melanogaster, p. humanus were chosen to represent the insect orders: hemiptera, coleoptera, hymenoptera, diptera, and phthiraptera, respectively. phylogenetic reconstruction places apst <dig> in a well-supported clade containing unknown function insect transporters; mammalian glut class i transporters ; and glut class ii transporters    <cit> . apst <dig>  is most closely related to single orthologous insect transporters, all of unknown function, from p. humanus , a. mellifera , and multiple  orthologs in t. castaneum  and n. lugens . apst <dig> and closely related  insect transporters are more distantly related to well-characterized mammalian glut class i facilitative hexose transporters   <cit> .figure  <dig>

discussion
here, in an update to our original sugar transporter gene annotation  <cit> , we have used a de novo search to identify  <dig> sugar porter family transporters in the latest version of the a. pisum genome . compared to our previous study, which identified  <dig> putative sugar transporters  <cit> , we present a subset of the original gene list  that match the tigrfams sugar porter family motif . the refinement of the original gene set is due in part, to a more stringent cut-off value used for transporter identification, combined with five gene models being withdrawn from the latest a. pisum genome assembly. the withdrawn gene models were previously identified as: apst <dig>  acypi007611; apst <dig>  acypi007211; apst <dig>  acypi006926; apst <dig>  acypi003842; and apst <dig>  nw_ <dig>  <cit> . a reduced number of putative sugar transporter genes were also identified in de novo searches of other insect genomes . this reduction is again due to use of a more stringent cut-off used for whole genome de novo searches combined with use of updated genome assemblies.

of the  <dig> annotated a. pisum sugar porter family transporters , four transporters: apst <dig>  apst <dig>  apst <dig> and apst <dig> are highly expressed and/or enriched in gut tissue. in our functional assays of these four transporters, only apst <dig>  and apst <dig>  transport glucose and fructose. our data is consistent with a. pisum using facilitative transporters apst <dig> and apst <dig> at the gut interface for import of glucose and fructose  <cit> . based on transport function, we hypothesize that glucose and fructose moving passively from high concentrations in the gut lumen, to low concentrations of glucose and fructose in the haemolymph  <cit> . the functional role of apst <dig> and apst <dig> at the a. pisum gut interface remains unknown. although apst <dig> and apst <dig> were expressed in the yeast hexose-transport deficient mutant eby.vw <dig> , they both failed to functionally complement the yeast mutant . it is possible that apst <dig> and apst <dig> were not efficiently targeted to the yeast plasma membrane and were not available for sugar uptake. alternatively, the hexose sugars used in our functional assays were not recognized substrates. current work is underway to functionally express apst <dig> and apst <dig> and further investigate their transport properties and substrate selectivity.

aphid transporters apst <dig> and apst <dig> are structurally, functionally and phylogenetically related to mammalian gluts. both apst <dig> and apst <dig>  like their human glut orthologs have a conserved sequence motif in transmembrane helix  <dig>  that is critical for substrate selectivity  <cit>  . specifically, human gluts  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which transport glucose but not fructose have a conserved qls amino acid motif in tm7; whereas gluts  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> which transport glucose and fructose have amino acid residues: hva, mgg, mag, mac, or gsa respectively, in the equivalent position  <cit>  . the functional role of the qls motif for determining glucose specificity has been experimentally validated in two independent experiments  <cit> . first, a glut3/ <dig> chimera, where the beginning of tm <dig> to the c-terminus of glut <dig>  was replaced by the corresponding region of glut <dig>  converted the protein to a glucose/fructose transporter, with glut <dig> kinetics  <cit> . second, a substitution experiment, where glut <dig> had amino acids hva replaced with qls, and glut <dig> had amino acid qls replaced with hva resulted in partial reversal of their substrate specificities and uptake kinetics  <cit> . insect glut-like transporters apst <dig>  <cit> , apst <dig>  and nlst <dig>  <cit>  are all facilitative glucose/fructose transporters. sequence analysis, demonstrates that these transporters, similar to human glut glucose/fructose transporters, do not have a qls-motif in tm <dig>  consistent with glucose and fructose transport . in an extension of this observation, based on the presence of the qls amino acid motif within tm <dig> for all insect glut class i orthologs included in our analysis  , we make the prediction that they are all specific for glucose . current work is underway to further investigate structure/function relationships across insect glut class i orthologs.

our functional screen specifically targeted sugar transporters belonging to the major facilitator superfamily, the largest family of characterized sugar transporters. however, it is possible that aphid transporters belonging to the solute:sodium symporter  family  also transport sugars. as with the sugar porter family, previously described, sugar transporters within the solute:sodium symporter family are also most extensively characterized in humans . human sodium-glucose transporters, also known as na+/glucose cotransporters , mediate active transport of glucose i.e. they can move glucose against its concentration gradient. the a. pisum genome contains  <dig> solute:sodium symporter family transporters ,  <dig> of which are predicted to function as sodium/monocarboxylate cotransporters, and the other as a sodium/choline cotransporter . importantly, our whole genome de novo searches did not identify a. pisum solute:sodium symporter family glucose transporters. therefore, our data predicts that a. pisum uses only facilitative sugar transporters for sugar homeostasis, and not as in mammals, a combination of facilitate transporters and active transporters  <cit> . more generally, we hypothesize that aphid sugar homeostasis is energy-independent and maintained by facilitated diffusion  of sugars. this prediction necessitates a large family of related sugar transporters, with differing tissue expression patterns, and importantly subtle differences in substrate affinity between transporters.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study demonstrates that a. pisum encodes a large family of sugar porter family transporters. based on gene expression patters, only  <dig> transporters  are predicted to play a functional role at the gut interface. here we characterize a. pisum sugar transporter  <dig>  apst <dig>  as a facilitative glucose/fructose transporter. our gene expression and functional transport analyses are consistent with apst <dig> playing a role in aphid sugar transport, functioning at the gut interface to transport glucose and fructose. here, we demonstrate that apst <dig> is, structurally, functionally and phylogenetically related to mammalian glut class i facilitative transporters. by placing transporters in a phylogenetic framework this work will facilitate prediction and testing of as yet uncharacterized sugar transporters across related taxa.
