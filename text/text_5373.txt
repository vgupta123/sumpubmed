BACKGROUND
in mammals, angiotensin-converting enzyme , an important member of the m <dig> peptidase family, is found on the surface of endothelial cells and is best known for its role in the biosynthesis of angiotensin ii, as well as the degradation of circulating bradykinin and the haemoregulatory peptide, n-acetyl sdkp  <cit> . mammalian ace exists as two isoforms, a somatic form  and a smaller protein  found exclusively in adult testes. the ace gene comprises twenty-six exons and two promoters, and has clearly arisen by gene duplication  <cit> . the somatic promoter drives expression of the larger protein , which consists of two very similar domains connected in tandem by a short inter-domain peptide. each domain possesses a functional peptidase active site and they are commonly called the n- and c-domains after their relative position to the amino and carboxy termini. the bulk of the protein including the amino terminus is extracellular and is linked by a hydrophobic transmembrane sequence to a short intracellular peptide. the biological rationale for two catalytic units linked in tandem is not known, although there is experimental evidence to suggest that co-operativity exists between the two halves of the protein  <cit> .

in developing spermatids, an alternative intragenic promoter utilises exons 13– <dig> and generates a single domain ace  which is largely identical to the c-terminal domain of somatic ace  <cit> . male mice lacking gace are infertile as a result of sperm that are defective in migration in the oviduct and in binding to the zona pellucida  <cit> .

insect ace has broad substrate specificity and its presence in the haemolymph of insects raises the possibility that, like mammalian sace, it is required for extracellular metabolism of peptide hormones  <cit> . drosophila melanogaster has six ace-like genes , all coding for single domain proteins. the ance protein has been relatively well characterised and has been shown to have several biochemical similarities to the mammalian enzyme. its activity is developmentally regulated, with highest levels during metamorphosis  <cit> . ance is also expressed in spermatocytes and appears to have an important role in spermiogenesis  <cit> . of the other drosophila aces, only the acer gene product has been studied biochemically and it is likely that ance- <dig>  ance- <dig>  ance- <dig> and ance- <dig> do not function as peptidases since they lack one or more of the residues that are essential for peptidase activity  <cit> . acer, like ance and human ace, is a peptidyl dipeptidase, but is generally less efficient than ance at cleaving dipeptides from many oligopeptide substrates  <cit> . acer is expressed in the embryonic heart  <cit>  and in both the male and female gonads and brain of adult flies  where it is assumed to have a role in the metabolism of, as yet unidentified, biologically active peptides involved in neuroendocrine signalling and reproduction.

ace activity has been found in the gonads and accessory glands of several insect species in addition to d. melanogaster, suggesting a conserved role for this enzyme in insect reproduction  <cit> . recently, we have provided evidence for a role for ace in reproduction in the mosquito, a. stephensi. ace activity in the adult female mosquito increases by 260% following a blood meal  <cit>  and it has been proposed that the induced ace has a role in regulating peptide signalling in response to a blood meal. we have shown that feeding two different ace inhibitors to male a. stephensi in their glucose diet, resulted in approx. 80% reduction in the number of eggs laid  <cit> . in addition, ace inhibitors introduced in the blood meal, resulted in a dose-dependent effect on brood-size, but had no effect on oocyte development, nor the rate of digestion of the blood. the only observable difference between inhibitor-fed and control insects was that the inhibitor-fed females could not lay eggs, even  <dig> days after the blood meal, suggesting that the blood-induced ace is involved in the control of egg-laying  <cit> .

to understand the mechanism of ace induction in blood-fed mosquitoes and the role of the enzyme in mosquito reproductive physiology, we have characterised the ace gene family in anopheles gambiae, a mosquito responsible for the transmission of the human malaria parasite and whose genome has recently been sequenced  <cit> . the partially annotated a gambiae genome  <cit>  reveals between eight and twelve potential ace-like genes. we now report the correct number of a. gambiae ace  genes, confirm their corresponding protein sequences and establish their expression patterns during development and in response to a blood meal. we show that several of the anoaces are similar to other insect aces, but that anoace <dig> is a novel two-domain ace whose structure resembles that of human somatic ace.

RESULTS
ace-like genes in the a. gambiae genome
the ensembl annotation of the a. gambiae genome   <cit>  suggests that there are eight genes encoding proteins belonging to the m <dig>  family of peptidases. blast searching of the genome and an examination of the predicted genes, however, shows that not all ace-like proteins have been predicted, while several of those that have been identified have missing exons, or are hybrids, composed of exons from more than one ace-like gene. these problems are particularly acute for a cluster of ace-like sequences at 35c on chromosome 3r . in order to confirm the number and organisation of ace-like genes in the a. gambiae genome a combination of tblastn analysis  <cit> , using drosophila melanogaster ace proteins as query sequences, and cdna sequence analysis was carried out. results are summarised in tables  <dig> and  <dig> and may be viewed as a custom track in ensembl mosquito  <cit> .

tblastn analysis revealed  <dig> possible ace-like coding sequences. six of these sequences are arranged in a tightly linked tandem cluster at 35c . these were numbered  anoace  <dig> , <dig> , <dig> and  <dig>  several est clones exist for anoace <dig> and anoace <dig>  allowing the exons of these genes, and their coding regions to be unambiguously assigned. anoace <dig> has two alternative transcripts which differ in their first exon. no cdna clones are available for anoaces  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the exons of these genes were identified by blast similarity and the snap exon predictions of ensembl  <cit> . the nucleotide sequences of anoaces  <dig> and  <dig> are 97% identical, including the introns, which raised the possibility that these two genes are the result of a sequence assembly error caused by nucleotide polymorphisms in the pest strain. this high level of identity is only observed within the putative transcribed region, however. the upstream flanking sequence of anoace <dig> shares only around 75% identity with the anoace <dig> upstream dna and there is no significant similarity between the downstream flanking sequences of the two genes. an assembly error can therefore be ruled out.

the anoace <dig> gene has an unusual organisation; there are eight upstream exons situated at the 3' end of the 35c cluster which encode the bulk of the protein and there are two exons encoding the c terminus of the protein  <dig> kb downstream . these exons were shown to belong to the anoace <dig> gene by the sequence of nap <dig> cdna p141-g-08- <dig> which spans exon  <dig> and the two downstream exons . the gene structure was further confirmed by tblastn alignment with the drosophila ance- <dig> protein. the 5' end of anoace <dig> was determined by rt-pcr analysis using nested primers designed against the genomic sequence. a  <dig>  kb rt-pcr product was cloned, sequenced and found to contain a long open reading frame coding for a protein which overlapped existing predicted anoace <dig> protein sequence and which had a putative signal peptide. this was assumed to correspond to the n terminus of the anoace <dig> precursor.

the anoace <dig> gene contains two ace-like coding regions. the sequence of cdna  <dig>  spans both coding regions , indicating that this is a single gene coding for a double-domain protein, rather than two separate genes .

comparative genomics of ace-like genes
a phylogram showing the relationships of the anoaces to other insect and chordate aces is shown in fig.  <dig>  anoaces  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cluster with drosophila ance and acer, and ace-like proteins from apis mellifera, haematobia irritans, lutzomyia longipalpis and bombyx mori. these proteins are all single domain proteins which lack a hydrophobic c terminus. a second cluster of insect proteins contains anoaces  <dig> and  <dig>  the two remaining apis aces and drosophila ance- <dig>  anoace <dig> is a one-to-one orthologue of ance- <dig> and of apis  <dig>  anoace <dig> is a one-to-one orthologue of apis  <dig>  there appears to be no drosophila orthologue of anoace <dig>  the similarity of the anoace <dig> group extends to the genomic organisation of the genes. in each case the bulk of the protein is encoded by a set of upstream exons and these are separated from the downstream exons, encoding the c terminus of the protein by a large intron. in the case of anopheles the intron is  <dig> kb in length, in drosophila  <dig> kb and in apis  <dig> kb. the proteins in this group are characterised by an extended n terminus, rich in proline and charged amino acids. anoace <dig> and drosophila ance- <dig> have a hydrophobic c terminus but this is absent from the predicted apis protein. gpi anchor prediction software  <cit>  predicts no gpi anchor for anoace <dig> whereas drosophila ance- <dig> has a strong gpi anchor prediction.

anoaces  <dig> and  <dig> are placed in a cluster with a diverse group of ace-like proteins that includes drosophila ances- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  the c. elegans ace-like protein acn- <dig> and vertebrate ace <dig>  the latter protein, while having sequence similarity to aces, has a different enzymatic activity and acts as a carboxypeptidase rather than a dipeptidase. several members of this group  lack one or more essential active site amino acids and are therefore unlikely to be active peptidases. anoace <dig> has several structural similarities with chordate aces. it has two active site domains and a hydrophobic c terminus with a strong gpi anchor prediction . the n and c domains of this protein are more similar to each other than to other aces, unlike the vertebrate n and c domains which cluster together.

expression of anoace genes
primers for all anoace genes were validated by pcr amplification of genomic dna or cdna. each primer pair produced a product of the expected size .

for semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis rna was extracted and cdna produced from different developmental stages of mosquitoes, namely, eggs, larvae, pupae, adult males, glucose-fed females and blood-fed females. figure  <dig> shows that anoaces  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are expressed at all developmental stages tested, whereas no pcr product was observed for anoaces  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the authenticity of the products from anoace <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> was confirmed by cloning into the pgem t-easy® vector and sequencing.

gene expression for all the anoace genes was analysed in glucose and blood-fed females using quantitative real-time rt-pcr. other than anoaces  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig>  expression levels were as for no template controls. transcription of anoace <dig>  anoace <dig> and anoace <dig> was shown to be up-regulated  <dig> hours following a blood meal . the increase in transcription was consistent for three separate cohorts of female mosquitoes.

discussion
our analysis of the a. gambiae genome has revealed nine ace-like genes. this is the largest number of ace genes for any species with a complete genome sequence. drosophila melanogaster has six ace-like genes  <cit> , but only two of these  are known to code for active peptidase proteins. as well as having the ace-like genes found in d. melanogaster, d. pseudoobscura has an additional ance-like gene which is likely to code for an active peptidase, since all the amino acids that are necessary for catalysis and coordination with the active site zinc are conserved . apis mellifera has three ace-like genes, each with a full complement of the critical active site amino acids  <cit> . at present we have evidence that at least four anoace genes  are expressed, but have no evidence for expression of anoaces  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  all of the anoace genes, however, have complete open reading frames and the corresponding proteins have a full complement of essential active site amino acids, so we cannot rule out the expression of the other genes at low levels, in a small number of cells or at stages that we have not examined.

some of the anoace genes have clearly arisen by recent gene duplications. the cluster at 35c contains five genes that are closely related in sequence. two of these  are almost identical. similar clusters of other duplicated genes exist within the a. gambiae genome; for example there is a cluster of m <dig> carboxypeptidase genes at 29d which contains adjacent genes with greater than 90% identity. in both these clusters the high levels of identity are restricted to the transcribed regions with flanking dna showing lower levels of similarity. this suggests that selective pressures are maintaining the nucleotide sequences of these genes and that they are expressed at some stage.

comparison of ace protein sequences  suggests that there are three functional groupings in insects. the first contains drosophila ance, anoaces  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and several other insect aces. these are single domain, secreted enzymes. this class of ace proteins is similar to the chordate n and c domains, both in terms of sequence and enzyme activity. the second group includes anoace <dig>  drosophila ance- <dig> and apis  <dig>  these proteins are single domain, but have extended n termini. the drosophila and mosquito proteins have a hydrophobic c terminus suggesting that they may be membrane-tethered. the active sites of these three proteins are characterised by an alanine in place of glycine at position  <dig> of the hexxh motif . anoace <dig> and apis  <dig> form diverged members of this group.

the third group of insect aces, containing anoace <dig> and drosophila ance- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  is highly divergent. these appear to be secreted proteins and, whereas anoace <dig> may be enzymically active, the drosophila examples lack essential active site amino acids. c. elegans acn- <dig> and vertebrate ace <dig> proteins form highly diverged members of this family. this result is to be expected as they have distinctive and highly evolved roles in these animals  <cit> .

anoace <dig> is highly unusual. phylogenetic analyses using several different tree construction methods  do not place it convincingly in any of the insect groups described above. in terms of overall structure it is more similar to mammalian somatic ace than to any invertebrate ace described so far . it has two active site domains and has a hydrophobic c terminus. this similarity with vertebrate aces is, as far as we know, unique amongst non-chordate invertebrates. it is likely that anoace <dig> is membrane bound, either by virtue of its hydrophobic c-terminus or via a potential gpi anchor. in mammals, membrane sace can be released from the plasma membrane by unidentified metalloproteases, known as secretases or sheddases, that cleave the arg-ser bond in the ala-arg-ser-glu motif of the juxtamembrane stalk  <cit> . interestingly, a similar peptide sequence  is found in the same position in the proposed juxtamembrane stalk of anoace <dig> , which might serve as a cleavage site for a mosquito ace secretase.

in mammals, the two active sites of sace are involved in the conversion of angiotensin i to angiotensin ii and the hydrolysis of bradykinin, but only the n-domain is involved in n-acetyl sdkp metabolism  <cit> . thus, duplication appears to have provided an opportunity for the n-domain to acquire distinctive substrate specificity. however, this does not explain why mammalian sace is a single protein with two catalytic domains joined by a peptide linker, rather than single genes encoding single domain proteins as occurs in d. melanogaster. our phylogenetic analysis indicates that the gene duplication event leading to the two-domain vertebrate somatic ace, occurred around  <dig> million years ago, before the divergence of amphibians and fishes, and that two other very similar events occurred independently to give rise to a two-domain enzyme: one in the lineage leading to a. gambiae and one in the urochordate lineage leading to ciona intestinalis . that is, two-domain ace proteins have been selected for on three separate occasions, suggesting that there is a distinct functional advantage to having two active sites organised in this manner over two single-domain proteins. support for this hypothesis comes from several studies on mammalian sace that suggest that the two active sites can have cooperative effects on ace activity  <cit> . recent studies indicate that the n-domain of human somatic ace also has a negative effect on the shedding of the protein from the cell surface by cleavage within the stalk region that separates the c-domain from the membrane anchor  <cit> . more detailed biochemical studies on anoace <dig> are now required to determine whether similar cooperative phenomena occur in mosquitoes.

the expression of anoaces  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> is induced by a blood meal. two of these genes  are induced more than ten-fold. neuropeptides are known to be important for mediating several behavioural and physiological responses to a blood meal in mosquitoes  <cit> . our previous work showing that ace inhibitors block egg-laying, but not egg development, in blood fed a. stephensi  <cit>  led us to propose that the elevated peptidase activity might be important for regulating a peptide signal involved in egg-laying. the up-regulation of anoaces  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> following a blood meal in a. gambiae, raises the possibility that ace may also be involved in regulating post feeding oviposition in this species.

a role for at least some anoaces in the immune response is suggested by recent microarray data  <cit> . anoace <dig>  was shown to be  <dig> -fold upregulated by challenge with salmonella typhimurium. anoace <dig>  was  <dig> -fold upregulated by staphylococcus aureus infection, whereas the expression of anoace <dig>  was reduced  <dig> -fold by beauveria bassiana. we were unable to detect anoace <dig> expression in a variety of developmental stages. however, the expression of this gene suggested by the infection microarray may mean that this gene plays a specific role as a component of the immune response.

CONCLUSIONS
the anopheles gambiae genome contains  <dig> genes coding for proteins with similarity to mammalian ace. six of these genes are found in a tandem cluster situated at 35c on chromosome 3r. five of the members of this cluster code for proteins which are similar to previously described insect aces: they contain a single active site domain and lack a c-terminal hydrophobic region. anoace <dig>  situated at the 3' end of the 35c cluster, is an orthologue of drosophila ance- <dig> and of apis gene ensapmg <dig>  in all three species, there is a similar gene structure with the bulk of the coding exons separated from the c-terminal exons by a large intron which contains other genes. the anoace <dig> protein, like drosophila ance- <dig>  has a hydrophobic c-terminus and is likely to be membrane bound. anoaces  <dig> and  <dig> are also predicted to be single domain proteins but anoace <dig> is unique amongst insect aces described so far in that it contains two active site domains and has a hydrophobic c-terminus, a structure similar to that of mammalian somatic ace. expression of only  <dig> of the anopheles ace genes  could be detected by rt-pcr in the stages tested. expression of anoaces  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> increased following a blood meal.
