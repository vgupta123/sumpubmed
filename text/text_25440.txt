BACKGROUND
in the past, the relative simplicity of the nervous system of invertebrates such as helix snails allowed the detailed study of many aspects of neuronal connectivity  <cit> , neurite outgrowth  <cit> , synapse formation and plasticity  <cit>  by using an in vitro approach . in this experimental preparation, a large number of neurons can be individually identified and isolated in cell culture. the study of reciprocal interactions among identified neurons in small reconstructed circuits was pioneered in  <dig> by kleinfeld et al.  <cit>  by using aplysia neurons. more recently, the connectivity between c <dig>  c <dig>  and b <dig> helix neurons was first investigated at the level of micro-networks   <cit> , and later at the level of large-networks  <cit> , by exploiting the technology offered by micro-electrode arrays . in vivo, the serotonergic c <dig> neurons, localized in the ventral side of cerebral ganglia, are synaptically connected to b <dig> neurons in the buccal ganglia  <cit> , and they are involved in the regulation of feeding behaviors of helix snails. in this way, it is feasible to reconstruct in dissociated cell culture synaptic connections among individually identified invertebrate neurons that resemble in vitro their in vivo features  <cit> . helix neurons are large in size  compared with the microelectrode diameter  of meas. this geometrical ratio makes possible a 1: <dig> coupling between neurons and microelectrodes , facilitating the study of the relationship between the electrophysiological activity of individual neurons in a network, as well as the development of neurite outgrowth. however, the aforementioned studies were acutely performed, recording the electrophysiological activity for a few hours once the circuit has been established.

to the best of our knowledge, in vitro studies about long lasting  recordings of invertebrate neuronal networks cannot be found. the possibility to couple helix neurons to meas, allows recordings of the electrophysiological activity and monitoring the development of network organization can modulate such activity in the long term.

indeed, mea technology is the “gold standard” to study the development of in vitro neuronal networks, as demonstrated by many studies related to mammalian cortical networks  <cit> : during development, while synapses and neural connectivity build up, neuronal network activity starts to self-organize  <cit> , and modulates its electrophysiological patterns .

following this approach, the purpose of this work is to study and characterize the dynamics and connectivity of helix networks made up of c <dig> and b <dig> neurons coupled to meas during their development.

helix neurons start to create synaptic connections just a few hours after plating, and their development is faster  than cortical cultures from mammals   <cit> . a peculiarity of these invertebrate neuronal networks is the absence of spontaneous activity: the helix neurons used in this study were found to be generally silent on meas  <cit> , and spontaneous firing was observed only occasionally. therefore, we triggered neuronal activity by means of chemical treatments, namely potassium chloride  which induces general depolarization of the cell membrane potential and serotonin  which selectively depolarizes b <dig> neurons. thus, the induced activity was followed during development at fixed time-points  and analyzed by means of the first-order statistics used to characterize neuronal dynamics: inter spike interval  and firing rate. the estimation of the functional connections established among neurons of the network was made by using cross-correlation function  <cit>  in order to reconstruct the topological connections, and monitor them during development. considering the simplicity of these neuronal circuits, a comparison with the morphological development of the network was possible, and a good matching between morphological and functional links was achieved.

we found that both chemical stimulations  were efficacious to trigger firing activity in helix circuits, but a long-lasting change in activity occurred only with 5-ht treatment. we did not observe a modulation of the dynamics as far as the network evolved, although we counted an increase with time of functional connections. moreover, the analysis of spiking activity as well as functional link latencies suggest that networks treated with 5-ht displayed a dynamic modulated mostly by chemical synapses, while a predominance of electrical connections occurred in kcl-triggered networks.

RESULTS
experimental data collected by meas and presented in this work were obtained from  <dig> helix cultures, monitored at the  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours after plating. as explained in the methods section, we considered  <dig> cultures treated with serotonin ,  <dig> with extracellular high-potassium , and  <dig> as control, i.e., without any kind of treatment.

helix polysynaptic circuits display a treatment-dependent long-lasting activity
when helix neurons are cultured in vitro, they do not display any kind of electrical spontaneous activity  <cit> . we followed the development  of  <dig> cultures made up of  <dig> b <dig> and  <dig> c <dig> neurons arranged in the configuration depicted in figure 1a. at each time-point, we recorded  <dig> min of spontaneous activity: no spike activity was observed in the  <dig> non stimulated cultures. to verify the healthy conditions of the networks, and the effective presence of synaptic connections, we delivered electrical stimulation at the 72nd hour. selected cells were singularly impaled and stimulated with a current pulse whose amplitude was sufficient to overcome the excitability threshold. under these conditions, we were able to observe a network activity which involved all neurons of the network .

to trigger electrophysiological activity in helix networks, we chemically treated such cultures by means of two stimulation protocols at each time-point of recording: i) increasing extracellular potassium concentration  from  <dig> mm to  <dig> mm, that results in a general depolarization of the membrane potentials of cells; ii) delivery of serotonin  in a concentration equals to  <dig> μm that selectively depolarizes b <dig> neurons. the details of these protocols are described in the methods section.

figure  <dig> shows the qualitative results from one culture treated with kcl. each horizontal block of the figure represents a recording time-point . the three raster plots per each block show one minute of electrophysiological activity before, during and after the kcl delivery. red and blue lines are for c <dig> and b <dig> neurons, respectively. the first observation is that kcl induced a transient depolarization of the network which lasted no more than  <dig> minute: neurons quickly depolarized with a delay of  <dig> ±  <dig> ms from the kcl delivery. as a result of the sustained membrane depolarization, networks moved toward a quiescent state before the wash-out, possibly through the inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels. the phases before and after the kcl stimulation were mainly characterized by the absence of activity: before the stimulation, helix networks were always completely silent . after the wash-out the network reached a resting state, where no activity was recorded: only little oscillations in the b <dig> neurons were occasionally found, as shown in figure 3a. the main observation from these raster plots and from the ifr curves from 24– <dig> hours of development is that kcl does not induce persistent activity in the network. this transient behavior was constant for all the periods of recording during development.

conversely, a long-lasting neural activity in networks treated with 5-ht were observed. figure  <dig>  arranged with the same graphical layout of figure  <dig>  shows an example of helix network treated with 5-ht. except for the raster plots of the first block , neurons continued to fire after the wash-out , and several hours later . the delivery of 5-ht seems to trigger the neuronal network circuits towards an oscillatory state which persists for long-term during network development. we estimated the frequency of the quasi-periodic behavior of the c <dig> and b <dig> cells by computing the reciprocal of the isi. once entered into a periodic regime, we found that c <dig> neurons fired at a frequency which range from  <dig>  hz during the pre-stimulation phase, to  <dig>  hz during the stimulation and then decreasing to  <dig>  hz in the post stimulus phase. these values were maintained during the network development. b <dig> neurons exhibited a firing frequency of about  <dig> hz during the periodic regime. to assess whether the firing activity was periodic, we computed the coefficient of variation  of the isi. by setting an arbitrary threshold at  <dig> , we considered quasi-periodic those neurons which presented a cv less than  <dig> . additional file  <dig> shows the trends of both the cv and the frequency. the networks treated with kcl never displayed a quasi-periodic behavior, since cv was always greater than  <dig> .

to better analyze the mechanisms underlying 5-ht-induced long-lasting activity, we further characterized helix networks in order to evaluate whether this event is related to changes in cell excitability or, alternatively, to modifications of morphological and functional connectivity.

helix networks show stable dynamics during development
following the approach used to characterize the in vitro development of mammalian cortical neurons coupled to meas  <cit> , we first quantified the mean firing rate  and the inter spike interval . figure 3a and b shows the ifr trends of the c <dig>  and b <dig>  neurons. by comparing the ifr trends of the cultures treated with kcl  and 5-ht , the main difference was the total absence of electrophysiological activity in both c <dig> and b <dig> neurons before the kcl stimulation. on the contrary 5-ht induced a low-frequency  baseline activity, especially in the b <dig> cells. during development, no remarkable differences were noticed: in cultures stimulated with kcl, we observed a rapid increase of activity immediately after the stimulation, which lasted less than  <dig> minute. both in c <dig> and b <dig> neurons, the ifr reached a maximum value of  <dig> hz. in the case of 5-ht stimulation the ifr after a sudden increase remained stable through all the stimulation phase. no main differences were observed during development. c <dig> and b <dig> neurons fired in a very regular way: b <dig> neurons fired at a higher frequency than c <dig>  and this activity remained until the wash-out. afterwards, after a brief transient  characterized by a silent period, b <dig> neurons spontaneously restarted to fire. in this post stimulus phase, the dynamics exhibited by the networks treated with kcl was more irregular: c <dig> neurons were always quiescent during development, whereas b <dig> ones showed a peak of activity at the 48th hour. then, the ifr slowed down at 54th hour to zero at the 72nd hour.

by quantifying the amount of spikes generated by networks stimulated by kcl or 5-ht during development, we computed the mfr as depicted in figures 3c and 3d. averaged over a time window of  <dig> minutes, the mfr peaks for the helix neuronal networks treated with kcl, and 5-ht reached values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  sp/s, respectively. in particular, we found a maximum value of the mfr for the network treated with 5-ht equals to  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   sp/s during the stimulation phase at the 72nd hour time-point. for the kcl manipulation, a peak in the firing activity of  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   sp/s was reached after  <dig> hours from the plating in the post stimulation phase. interestingly, mfr values were statistically equal during development , suggesting that spiking activity was stable although the network connectivity changed and evolved .

to better quantify possible changes in the network dynamics during in vitro development, we derived the inter spike interval  distribution as shown in figure  <dig>  figures 5a and b show the isi distributions relative to the stimulation phases , kcl ) for c <dig> and b <dig> neurons, respectively. we found that kcl induced a faster spiking activity than 5-ht: both c <dig>  and b <dig>  neurons when stimulated with kcl  presented a main isi peak less than  <dig>  s, while the 5-ht treatment  shifted such peaks for both c <dig> and b <dig> neurons towards  <dig> s. the latency of the main peak  showed no statistically significant differences during development both for c <dig> and b <dig> neurons and for both stimulations . thus, comparing the cultures treated with kcl and 5-ht, we found a statistically significant difference in the isi temporal peak position .

synaptically isolated helix neurons do not show excitability changes with 5-ht and kcl treatments
in order to evaluate 5-ht or kcl-induced alterations in neuronal excitability, we measured biophysical parameters on cultured isolated c <dig> and b <dig> neurons, by using intracellular recording techniques. the same cell culture procedures and treatments described for mea devices were applied to these cells. we analyzed both spontaneous and firing activity induced by a depolarization stimulus applied at  <dig> hours after plating, before the treatment and soon after the treatment washout . moreover, the same cells were recorded again at  <dig> hours after plating to check the presence of long-term effects. generally, at  <dig> hours after plating, b <dig> neurons displayed a low-frequency spontaneous activity before the treatment . these cells strongly increased their firing activity after the washout of  <dig> μm serotonin applied for  <dig> minutes, switching their firing rates from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  spikes/s to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  spikes/s . no significant change was observed after the washout of high-kcl solution, thus confirming that washout completely depleted the potassium-induced activity. the same cells were tested again at 24-hour time-point and no spontaneous activity was detected in all the experimental groups. on the other hand, c <dig> neurons were always completely silent .

these observations indicate that helix isolated cells did not show any prolonged spontaneous activity triggered by 5-ht application, differently from polysynaptic circuits recorded on mea devices .

in addition, we also investigated whether the activity of 5-ht-treated circuits may be ascribed to changes in cellular excitability by considering the firing rate of single cells induced by a depolarization pulse . isolated b <dig> neurons showed the same response in all experimental groups . interestingly, we observed a general increase in excitability from 6- to 24-hour time-points in c <dig> neurons . a two-way anova for repeated measures confirmed a significant effect of time  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). here, the application of serotonin induced a rapid and strong increase in firing rate that is statistically significant if compared to control and kcl-treated groups . thus, we can infer that c <dig> neurons bear receptors responsive for serotonin that are involved in regulating their excitability without modifying their membrane potential, as observed in the homologous aplysia metacerebral cell  <cit> .

in all experimental groups, we observed no changes in other membrane properties, such as input resistance, threshold potential and resting potential . we further evaluated the presence of alterations in action potential  kinetics, measuring peak amplitude, ap half-width duration, ap rise time, ap decay time, after-hyperpolarization and rheobase. for each parameter, no difference was found between treated and control groups .

5-ht and kcl treatments modulate neurite outgrowth in helix circuitry
to better understand firing dynamics and functional connections inferred from mea recordings, a parallel evaluation of neurite outgrowth and morphological network was performed. we measured the number of neurites interconnecting neurons within the same cluster  and among the  <dig> different clusters the neurite density  to evaluate neurite densities. originally, data measured from c <dig> and b <dig> neuron have been analyzed separately: we decided to include these values in the same group since their growth rates were very similar to each other.

as shown in figure 7a, we found a general and rapid increase of intra-cluster neurite density with time reaching a limiting plateau value determined by the restricted surface area encompassed by each cluster . this parameter is treatment-dependent. a two-way anova for repeated measures revealed a significant effect of the treatment  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) and time  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) and a significant treatment by time interaction  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). particularly, we observed a statistically significant decrease of intra-cluster neurite density in 5-ht-treated circuits  that started from  <dig> hours and persisted at the following time-points reaching the value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  neurites/μm2vs.  <dig>  ±  <dig>  neurites/μm <dig> of control group  at  <dig> hours . conversely, the application of high-potassium solution induced an increase in neurite density with  <dig>  ±  <dig>  neurites/μm <dig> measured at  <dig> hours .

we also considered the inter-cluster neurite density as an index of long-range neurites reflecting the putative connections among the four clusters . during the first hours of development, none or few interconnecting neurites were observed confirming that signal propagation in the corresponding recordings was restricted to the cluster itself. inter-cluster neurite density linearly increased from  <dig> to  <dig> hours with similar values in the kcl-treated and the control groups. the distance between clusters  guaranteed a continuous neurite extension without imposing a plateau value. we found that this enhancement was significantly impaired by the application of serotonin .

to directly assess the presence of a growth deficit induced by a single serotonin application, we measured the velocity of neurite elongation at the different time-points. similar values were found in all experimental groups suggesting that the motility of growth cone has not been affected . thus, the lower neurite density may be ascribed to a direct effect of serotonin rather than a growth impairment, as observed in other models  <cit> .

helix networks display functional connections during development
to investigate the overall circuit connectivity, we analyzed whether the synaptic connections detected in complex polysynaptic circuits of c <dig> and b <dig> neurons were formed according to previous electrophysiological characterizations of individual monosynaptic pairs  <cit>  and whether the different treatments  modulate the functional connections, considering the evidence that neurite density is facilitated with kcl and depressed with 5-ht .

figures  <dig> show two examples of functional connectivity  maps relative to kcl  and 5-ht  treatments evaluated at the 48th hour after plating. two representative cross-correlations  were reported near the correspondent functional links: a relevant difference between kcl and 5-ht treatment on the cross-correlograms is the peak amplitude . fc maps were inferred from the ccs evaluated among all the active electrodes. following the approach proposed in  <cit> , we sorted all the statistically significant links based on the connection strengths, and we took into account only the  <dig> strongest links. in this way, it is likely we are considering the most reliable connections that would correspond to physical connections. from the fc analysis we did not find any relevant inter-cluster functional links even if we observed some long range connections in the morphological analysis . the interaction measured by means of cc suggests that such distant neurons are not functionally connected. in fact, we found among inter-cluster electrodes: i) noisy and not significant ccs; ii) cc peaks falling into the bin centered in zero, thus representative of a random co-activation  <cit> .

5-ht and kcl treatments modulate the synaptic strength and latency
as anticipated in the previous section, there is evidence that the two treatments modulate the fc of helix neuronal networks. thus, to characterize the functional links we estimated, for all the cultures and during their development, the strength , and latency .

figure 9a shows the number of detected connections as a function of the network development, averaged over the number of cultures . all the detected connections were intra-cluster, since no inter-cluster links were found. practically, this means that we were dealing with  <dig> and  <dig> not-functionally connected networks treated with 5-ht and kcl, respectively. kcl induces an increasing of the number of links compared with the networks manipulated with 5-ht showing similar results to that from measurement of neurite density . after  <dig> hours in vitro, the networks treated with kcl reached a steady-state value of functional connections, while a linear monotonic trend was observed in the case of 5-ht. interestingly, kcl-mediated connections were stronger than the 5-ht ones . the trend of the estimated synaptic strength showed a peak at around the 30th hours , and converged towards an asymptotic value . on the contrary, the estimated synaptic strength of the 5-ht networks was substantially flat with little oscillations and a small value around  <dig>  .

next, we characterized the functional connections as latencies between the cross-correlated electrodes. kcl-treated networks presented a relatively fast synaptic transmission  which remained rather constant during the development . in the 5-ht treatment, the synaptic transmission was much slower: after  <dig> hours in vitro, the average latency was already at a plateau value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms.

from the literature, it is known that helix neurons may form both chemical and electrical synapses in culture  <cit> . therefore, we consider the possibility that the two ranges of latencies measured may be related to the type of connection, more particularly to the synaptic delay. to sustain this hypothesis, we tested isolated c1-b <dig> and b2-b <dig> neuronal pairs for the presence of synaptic connections. intracellular recording data of firing neurons were computationally transformed into the first derivative to reproduce extracellular signals acquired by mea devices . this manipulation is justified by previous modeling studies in which the neuron-microtransducer junction and the extracellular recorded waveform were mathematically modeled and characterized  <cit> . then, we measured the delay time which occurred between two aps, one in the presynaptic cell and the other in the postsynaptic neuron triggered by the first signal . we observed that cells electrically interconnected always fired in a synchronous fashion with a 1: <dig> relationship. conversely, the action potentials recorded from chemically interconnected neurons were not always related to each other. in fact, an excitatory postsynaptic potential  elicited by presynaptic firing may not be sufficient to trigger a new action potential in the postsynaptic neuron. for instance, epsps may not reach the threshold potential or, alternatively, may occur during the repolarization phase, when neuron is refractory to stimulation. these signals would result in membrane potential fluctuations that cannot be detected on mea devices. therefore, we decided to include in this analysis only spikes that are effectively correlated to each other. we found that chemical and electrical synapses are characterized by delays equal to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms, respectively . such values are in agreement with the ones found at the network level  when treated with 5-ht and kcl, respectively.

taken together, these data suggested that kcl-treated helix networks were prevalently interconnected through electrical synapses characterized by robust signals, synchronous firing and a strong coupling with short latency. on the other hand, polysynaptic circuits in which 5-ht has been repeatedly applied were formed by chemical connections, explaining a weaker connectivity and the longer latency. therefore, we can infer that the enhancement of electrical versus chemical transmission in helix circuits may be strongly up-regulated by means of kcl adding, and vice versa in the case of 5-ht.

discussion
in this work, we studied the electrophysiological activity and dynamics of neuronal ensembles made up of c <dig> and b <dig> helix neurons during their in vitro development. the advantage of this biological preparation is the predetermined knowledge of cell type composition, biophysical properties and connectivity. in addition, by exploiting the mea technology , we were able to perform long-lasting measures in order to characterize the development of helix networks.

here, the absence of spontaneous activity  <cit>  was observed even during the formation of synaptically interconnected clusters, despite the increasing neuritic growth and arborization, and the establishment of synaptic connections. taking into account this feature, we decided to trigger electrophysiological activity by applying two chemical treatments: kcl, to promote a general depolarization ; and 5-ht, to activate serotonergic receptors which are selectively expressed on b <dig> neurons. following these stimulations, we observed similar dynamics during the development of these invertebrate circuits: the network firing early reached a value of firing rate and isi, which remained almost unchanged during the development despite the connectivity maturation. this behavior is very peculiar, especially if compared with studies regarding the development of in vitro cortical neurons of rat embryos,  <cit> , where it was found that cortical assemblies change their electrophysiological patterns as a function of the network maturation, perhaps because 1000-fold higher synapse density.

although we observed that both kcl and 5-ht stimulations were sufficient to trigger firing, we found that only 5-ht efficiently induced a sustained long-lasting activity after the first application.

serotonin has been frequently associated with changes in excitability. brief 5-ht application has often been observed to induce immediate hyperexcitability of aplysia sensory neurons, both in ganglion preparations  <cit>  and in cell cultures  <cit> . moreover, an increase in firing activity elicited by depolarizing current pulses has also been reported in rat cortical neurons after 5-ht exposure  <cit> , suggesting a phylogenetically-conserved modulatory action for this neurotransmitter. therefore, we evaluated the possibility that the observed long-term maintenance of firing activity could result from an increase of cell excitability. in addition to the b <dig> neuron response, a rapid increase of c <dig> neuron excitability was observed without alterations of other parameters, including membrane potential, input resistance and ap threshold. a similar effect was described in the aplysia metacerebral cell  <cit> , homologous to helix c <dig> neuron. even if the modulation of cell excitability may be a good explanation for triggering spontaneous activity in helix circuits, it cannot be the only effector in promoting its maintenance. behind the alteration of single cell properties, the emerging evidence would suggest changes in neuronal circuitry features as another putative cause, including the morphological and functional connectivity.

from a morphological point of view, our results showed an increase of neuritic density in cultures treated with kcl, while a reduction  occurred in 5-ht stimulated networks. there is a large body of evidence that attribute to 5-ht an inhibitory role in the regulation of neurite outgrowth in invertebrate models  <cit> , thus affecting both the development of arborizations and connectivity formation. in mammals, 5-ht has been implicated in shaping neuronal connectivity, e.g. decreasing neurite branching in rat cortical neurons during development  <cit>  and impairing neurite density in mouse organotypic slice cultures  <cit> .

from a functional point of view, helix neurons may form both chemical and electrical connections in vitro <cit> . cross-correlation and latency analysis revealed a strong association between treatment and the type of circuitry connectivity. from the first hours of development, networks treated with 5-ht display synaptic latencies of about  <dig> ms, compared to the ones treated with kcl . comparing these values with those measured from interconnected pairs of neurons, we found a striking correspondence between mea signal latency and the synaptic delays intracellularly recorded .

the selective presence of the two types of synaptic connections may reflect the different strength of functional links estimated by means of cross-correlation analysis. the occurrence and the magnitude of chemical signal transduction vary dramatically depending on culture conditions, mainly related to the presence of trophic factors  <cit> . moreover, phenomena such as neurotransmitter release modulation, synaptic delay, receptor desensitization, signal propagation along neurites and the postsynaptic refractory period may negatively affect the threshold potential to trigger an action potential in the postsynaptic cell. conversely, the presence of gap junctions facilitate synchronous activity of coupled cells, allowing the direct transmission of electrical signal, thus explaining the 10-fold higher value of cross-correlogram peaks measured from kcl-treated cultures.

in support to our results, 5-ht has also been demonstrated to selectively prevent the formation of electrical synapses while allowing chemical synaptogenesis between identified helisoma neurons  <cit> . the formation of electrical coupling between helisoma neuronal pairs is thought to require an active growth state and neurite elongation  <cit> , negatively modulated by 5-ht. however, a direct action of 5-ht on gap junctions has already been demonstrated in helisoma neurons  <cit> , as well as in developing rat cortical neurons  <cit> .

on the other hand, the kcl-induced increase in neurite density may contribute to enhance cell-cell contact, thus promoting a higher coupling coefficient among cells  <cit> . since gap junctions likely play a fundamental role in determining network synchronization  <cit> , signals may reverberate among neurons until they return to a silent state by switching off the circuit.

taken together, these observations suggest that the prevalence of chemical connections in 5-ht-treated circuits may be the cause of long-term maintenance of spontaneous activity. in this view, activity may be rapidly triggered by 5-ht application, through the depolarization of b <dig> neurons and the increased excitability of c <dig> neurons, and maintained by the continuous release of neurotransmitter from different firing neurons. accordingly, repetitive applications of serotonin have previously been implicated in the enhancement of neurotransmitter release through presynaptic mechanisms  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we characterized the dynamics exhibited by networks of helix neurons coupled to meas. by exploiting the technology offered by these devices, we were able to study the development of the network and thus to appreciate possible changes in the network dynamics and firing patterns. in addition, we inferred the functional connections established among the neurons of the networks. since spontaneously such invertebrate neurons are silent, we triggered their electrophysiological activity by delivering kcl or 5-ht. under these treatments, we found that: i) kcl depolarizes the network for brief periods , without long-term effects. the dynamics of the network is fast , and the detected functional connections show latencies compatible with electrical synapses . ii) 5-ht induces long-lasting firing activity that persists after the wash-out especially in b <dig> neurons. compared to kcl-induced dynamics, we observed that 5-ht treated networks showed a slower dynamic  and signal latencies characterized by delays of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms, suggesting that these circuits are mediated by chemical synapses. finally, although the number of functional connections growth as far as the networks develop following a trend comparable with the neuritic outgrowth, we did not find statistically differences in the firing patterns during development as only little deviations-modulations are observed on a rather stable baseline activity.
