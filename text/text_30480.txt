BACKGROUND
most plants originate from a single-celled zygote  <cit> . to achieve maturity, a plant must pass through different developmental stages that comprise a series of cell division, cell expansion and cell differentiation processes. despite the practical difficulties, understanding the regulation of plant development is reasonably well advanced for some processes, including lateral root formation, seed development, and fruit development, and genes that regulate these processes have been identified  <cit> . however, we are still far from fully understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern development.

the increasing power of genomic tools enables the changes in expression of thousands of genes to be profiled in parallel during sequential developmental stages. several high-throughput techniques can be used to study expression of mrnas, proteins, and metabolites  <cit> . although the final activity of a particular gene is determined by the encoded protein, measurements of mrna levels have proven to be valuable for identification of the molecular changes that occur in cells. transcriptomic analysis could also provide clues for construction of a digital in situ hybridization map of the cellular systems or cell-to-cell networks  <cit> .

we chose to identify regulatory developmental genes using the model bryophyte, physcomitrella patens. although they diverged hundreds of millions of years ago, bryophytes have similar fundamental genetic and physiological features to those of seed plants  <cit> . compared to vascular plants, bryophytes are argued to be an ideal system to study developmental mechanisms because of their accessible haploid stage and relatively simple structure  <cit> . among bryophytes, the moss physcomitrella patens has emerged recently as the bryophyte model of choice for several reasons, including its short life cycle   <cit>  and efficient homologous recombination  <cit> . furthermore, p. patens is placed phylogenetically between algae and seed plants  <cit> . therefore, studies on this species might be of both developmental and evolutionary significance.

the life cycle of p. patens consists of two generations: the haploid gametophyte generation followed by the diploid sporophyte  <cit> . gametophyte development is further divided into two stages: a juvenile filamentous stage, termed the protonema, and leafy adult stage, termed the gametophore because each leafy stem is capable of generating the sex organs  <cit> . the vegetative development of p. patens involves only a few cell types. in p. patens, when the haploid spore germinates, or when a protoplast derived from protonema tissue regenerates, a single-celled filament forms with the apical cell dividing and elongating by tip growth. soon after the filament forms, subapical cells divide obliquely and give rise to branches, thereby forming a highly branched filamentous network . initially, the protonema has perpendicular cross walls and is filled with large, spherical chloroplasts; filaments comprising this type of cell are called chloronema. subsequently, a second filament type develops, often in response to light and auxin, called a caulonema  <cit> . compared with chloronemal cells, caulonemal cells are longer, divide more often, and contain fewer chloroplasts, which are smaller and flattened. finally, the kind of branches produced changes from protonemal to those that give rise to leafy gametophores  <cit> . while protonemata grow in a two-dimensional network, the leafy gametophores grow upwards toward the light, thus forming a three-dimensional gametophyte.

recently, the availability of a high-quality genomic sequence for p. patens  <cit>  has facilitated '-omic' studies on this organism. in this study, we used the digital gene expression tag profiling  strategy driven by high-throughput sequencing technology to profile the transcripts at different stages of p. patens gametophyte development and obtained spatiotemporal-specific gene regulation models for growth and differentiation. furthermore, we also compared mrna profiles from chloronemal and caulonemal tissues, isolated with laser-capture microdissection. these results provide a comprehensive catalogue of gene expression changes from which potentially regulatory changes can be mined.

RESULTS
gametophytic morphogenesis during the culture of p. patens protoplasts
morphogenesis of moss gametophytes from protoplasts is similar to morphological development following germination of spores, but the similarity in gene expression level is unknown. this is in contrast to regeneration of the sporophyte from seed plant protoplasts, a process that proceeds through a callus phase and is often difficult to achieve in the laboratory  <cit> . in the present study, for p. patens a new cell wall was regenerated and a polar axis was established within  <dig> days of generating protoplasts. after  <dig> days of culture, chloronema containing two to three cells were present . by day  <dig>  small plants were present, containing both chloronema and caulonema . in day  <dig> plants, chloronemal cells were about twice as numerous as caulonemal cells . differentiation of cells into these two cell types is supported by the significant differences in length and chloroplast number per cell . by  <dig> days after protoplast formation, large numbers of buds had formed from protonemal filaments, which represent initiation of leafy shoots . after one month, mature gametophores were present .

data are mean ± sd. number of chloronema or caulonema cells per plantlet was scored in approximately  <dig> plantlets. number of chloroplasts per cell and cell length were counted in at least  <dig> chloronema or caulonema cells.

to analyze the gene expression profiles during gametophyte development, we harvested gametophytes at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days after protoplast isolation. to avoid circadian effects, harvesting was conducted at the same time of day. additionally, 14-day-old live protonemata were used to obtain chloronemal and caulonemal tissues by means of laser microdissection . each tissue sample comprised mitotically active cells  and mitotically inactive cells .

laser microdissection and rna quality
to obtain reliable dgep results, laser microdissection must produce a sufficient amount of rna of high integrity. laser microdissection conditions were optimized for the chloronemal and caulonemal cells of 14-day-old live protonema. the power and duration of laser pulses, especially of the ultraviolet  laser, affect rna integrity and are dependent on thickness of tissues. we tested the uv laser settings by applying test pulses different intensity and duration. finally, double the default uv capture power was used. the laser cutting properties had the following parameters: spacing =  <dig>  number of tabs =  <dig>  size =  <dig> 

of the conditions tested, uv cutting damage was minimized. as shown in table  <dig>  three sets of chloronemal or caulonemal tissue, respectively, were obtained. each tissue type contained more than  <dig>  cells and each set yielded more than  <dig> ng rna, corresponding to > <dig> pg rna per cell. in total,  <dig> μg and  <dig>  μg rna were obtained from chloronemal and caulonemal cell populations, respectively. rna integrity numbers were greater than  <dig> .

global gene expression profiles during gametophyte development
approximately  <dig>  to  <dig>  million 21-nt cdna tags were generated using the cdna library derived from each sample . distinct clean tags from each sample were used as data sets for mapping and further analysis . the full transcriptomic data set was deposited in the geo database , a software package available from bioconductor  <cit> , to normalize for tag distribution per library and determine significance values for differentially expressed genes. the edger algorithm uses an empirical bayes analysis to improve power in small sample sizes  <cit> . this accounts for biological and technical variation and has been implemented for tag-based data sets where small numbers of replicates are tested and standard errors disperse further from the mean at low versus high levels of expression  <cit> . we identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes during gametophyte development in p. patens with false discovery rate  corrected p-values of less than  <dig>  .

to ensure that meaningful changes were considered, we applied stringent statistical criteria to select genes, as described in the methods. a total of  <dig> genes were identified as differentially expressed by tag-based dgep . of these genes,  <dig> were differentially expressed as a function of developmental stage  and  <dig> were expressed differentially based on tissue type  . among the former  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes were preferentially expressed at a single developmental stage,  <dig> were expressed preferentially at two developmental stages, and  <dig> at more than two stages . of the  <dig> genes differentially expressed in the two cell types,  <dig> were preferentially expressed in caulonemal cells .

the top  <dig> significantly enriched gene ontology  terms for differentially expressed genes   are listed in additional file  <dig>  from  <dig> days to  <dig> days, biological processes of enriched degs focused on generation of precursor metabolites and energy, organic substance metabolic processes, energy reserve metabolic processes, regulation of photosynthesis light reaction, and regulation of generation of precursor metabolites and energy. the molecular functions of enriched degs were oxidoreductase activity  and sugar transmembrane transporter activity. however, the cellular components were organellar large or small ribosomal subunit, proton-transporting two-sector atpase complex, and membrane.

during bud formation , significant enriched degs differed from those detected during protonema development. the biological processes mainly focused on cellular component biogenesis at cellular level and the photosynthetic electron transport chain, as well as generation of precursor metabolites and energy. the molecular functions were similar to those detected after  <dig> days to  <dig> days. however, the cellular components were focused on the photosystem and chloroplast envelope.

other than the stages mentioned above, significant enriched degs concentrated on generation of precursor metabolites and energy, and functioned in acid-ammonia  ligase activity at the leafy shoot development stage .

for tissue-specific degs, significant enriched go terms were mainly involved in processes of cell wall component metabolism, modified amino acid metabolism, atp biosynthesis and metabolism, and oxidation-reduction, and functioned in transporter activities, such as hydrogen ion, inorganic cation, and substrate-specific transmembrane transport. these processes and molecular functions were mainly implemented in the proton-transporting two-sector atpase complex, intracellular organelle, ribosomal subunit and plastids.

validation of dgep data by quantitative real-time pcr
to validate the accuracy and reproducibility of the dgep results, the transcriptional levels of five randomly selected genes were measured by quantitative real-time pcr , in comparison with two internal genes that showed relatively stable expression levels . in all cases, the trends of real-time pcr-based expression profiles among these genes were similar to those obtained by dgep analysis .

developmental stage-specific profiling in the p. patens gametophyte
to elucidate the developmental stage-specific gene expression profiles, we further analyzed the expression patterns of all differentially displayed genes, with the expression level at  <dig> days taken as a common reference. based on this analysis, the  <dig> differentially expressed genes were grouped into six patterns using a k-means clustering algorithm . pattern  <dig> genes were highly expressed at day  <dig> and decreased to lower levels at subsequent stages of development; in contrast, expression of pattern  <dig> genes was low throughout development until day  <dig> when their expression rose. expression of pattern  <dig> genes peaked at day  <dig>  that of pattern  <dig> genes peaked at day  <dig>  and pattern  <dig> genes showed broad optimal expression that spanned from days  <dig> to  <dig> 

after  <dig> days of development, cell walls had regenerated and chloronema had formed . among the annotated pattern  <dig> genes , most were related to material and energy metabolism, and mainly participated in carbon fixation, protein and amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and starch and sucrose metabolism . in addition, this group contained several genes related to transport and ion binding, such as the auxin polar transport-related genes abcb <dig>  and abcb <dig> . pattern  <dig> also included several transcription factors and other regulatory genes. for example, this group included genes that encode a putative mada-box family member , a wrky transcription factor , a cytokinin response factor , two putative myb family members , a bzip family member  and a homologue of a gene involved in chromatin remodeling . moreover, several protein kinase-related genes were also preferentially expressed. finally, pattern  <dig> genes included a few putative stress-responsive genes, such as heat shock protein  <dig> members, peroxidase/catalase superfamily members, and a putative gene encoding a cdc <dig> protein . however, it is not clear whether or not expression of these stress-responsive genes reflects the inherent developmental program.

pattern  <dig> genes were expressed maximally at  <dig> days, which represented an early stage of gametophyte development with vigorous growth . not surprisingly, compared to day  <dig>  genes involved in ribosomal protein synthesis installation represent a major proportion of the total, which mainly functions in plastids . genes related to cell wall biosynthesis, light capture and carbon assimilation continued to represent a major component. with regard to regulatory proteins, genes encoding a calmodulin showed significant expression changes . moreover, a putative gene involved in histone lysine methylation  also showed peak expression.

genes in pattern  <dig> were expressed maximally at day  <dig>  a stage in which the leafy shoot initials form and which represents the transition from the two-dimensional protonemal network to the three-dimensional adult gametophyte . at this stage, although genes involved in material and energy metabolism were still the most abundant classes, their dominance decreased and the representation of genes among all other categories increased, including a few putative transcription factors , protein kinase  and methyltransferase categories  . interestingly, one of the pattern  <dig> genes was a putative transcription factor hb- <dig>  a putative homologue of which has been characterized in arabidopsis and is involved in the differentiation of preprocambial cells into xylem during leaf vein formation  <cit> . because bryophytes lack a vascular cambium, these results suggest that this transcription factor originally had a role in the development and the evolution of a pervasive multicellular plant body.

genes in pattern  <dig> were specifically expressed at the adult leafy shoot stage . at this stage, the proportion of metabolic genes increased to almost half and the proportion of protein synthesis genes decreased to a similar level to that of all other categories . approximately  <dig> members of several transcription factor families significantly increased in transcript level, such as members from the zinc finger, bhlh, myb, bah, bzip, chase and plate superfamilies. more than  <dig> protein kinase-encoding genes were also preferentially expressed. interesting regulatory genes in this group included those encoding a putative ethylene response gene  a putative thylene insensitive  <dig> , an auxin response factor  <dig> , a growth-regulating factor  <dig> , a putative mitogen- activated protein kinase  <dig> , a putative chase domain-containing histidine kinase protein  a histone lysine methylation-related gene , and a putative s phase-associated protein  <dig> .

candidate genes involved in protonema differentiation
vegetative development of p. patens involved only a few cell types. in our experimental conditions, a protonema initially comprised only chloronemal cells within the first  <dig> days. subsequently, the chloronemal tip cells began to change, ultimately differentiating into caulonemal cells. by day  <dig>  the protonemal colony included well-developed chloronema and caulonema . to understand the molecular basis that leads to the differences between the two cell types, we isolated the two cell types by laser-capture microdissection and used dgep to profile gene expression. in total, we identified  <dig> degs . of these,  <dig> degs were preferentially expressed in chloronemal cells and  <dig> in caulonemal cells.

of those genes preferentially expressed in chloronemal tissue, the majority functioned in metabolism and protein synthesis . additionally, a putative zinc finger  transcription factor and three protein modification-related genes were specifically expressed. among the  <dig> genes preferentially expressed in chloronemal tissue, significantly enriched genes functioned in ion binding, protein binding, rna binding and structural molecule actchloronemaity . compared with caulonemal tissue, genes preferentially expressed in chloronemal tissue represented four major categories: organic substance and energy metabolism , protein synthesis and proteolysis, transport, and cell wall synthesis and signaling pathways . genes related to several transcription factors in the two tissues  may play key roles during the differentiation of chloronemal and caulonemal tissues and were chosen as candidates for discussion and future study.

discussion
combination of laser-capture microdissection and dgep for tissue-specific transcript profiling-digital in situ hybridization
plant development reflects both endogenous genetic programs and responses to exogenous events  <cit> . analyses of global gene expression can reveal much about how genes function and how their products interact during development. most previous gene expression analyses sampled whole organs or tissues  <cit> . although these studies have provided valuable information, they are limited by the composite nature of plant organs, which consist of multiple tissues. we expect each cell type to have a unique transcriptome  <cit> . a transcriptomic analysis of a complete organ provides gene expression information integrated over all cell types, and is thus not particularly informative about cellular differentiation.

technical advances have made it possible to study global patterns of gene expression in an individual tissue, which increases the information revealed by expression profiling. a transcriptome from a single tissue can now be obtained by using laser-capture microdissection, an approach whereby a cell is physically isolated from the surrounding tissue  <cit> . several research groups have used laser-capture microdissection successfully to isolate specific plant cells  <cit> . typical laser capture microdissection is used on sectioned material, but the two-dimensional nature of the protonemal growth habit of p. patens allowed us to capture cells from living material, thereby minimizing undesirable changes in gene expression during sample preparation. because of the difficulty of obtaining more than  <dig>  apical or subapical cells of chloronemal and caulonemal tissues, we captured chloronemal and caulonemal samples that contained both mitotically active cells and mitotically inactive cells for dgep analysis.

dgep is conducted on a genome analyzer 2x system using an eight-lane flow cell, which can generate  <dig> to  <dig> million reads per run . in the present study, we successfully profiled chloronemal and caulonemal gene expression in p. patens by combined laser-capture microdissection and dgep. the results demonstrated lcm-mediated dgep analyses can be used to conduct global profiling of gene expression on individual tissues captured from live plants. we report here lcm-based methods to isolate chloronemal and caulonemal tissues from live protonema free of detectable contamination with intact non-target cells in p. patens . this is the first report of application of an lcm-based method to capture individual tissues from live plants. in this study,  <dig> genes were preferentially expressed in chloronemal or caulonemal tissue. our data provide important clues for elucidation of the molecular mechanism of cell differentiation and provide a useful baseline for future digital gene expression mapping.

altered metabolism during p. patens gametophyte development
at day  <dig>  half of the preferentially expressed genes  functioned in metabolism , most of which were involved in the citrate cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, and metabolism of pyruvate, starch, and sucrose. although earlier stages were not sampled, these findings suggest the regeneration process requires considerable metabolic reprogramming. it would be interesting to determine whether a similar pattern emerged in the first few days following spore germination.

in our culture conditions, protonema containing two cell types emerged between days  <dig> to  <dig> . not surprisingly, transcripts encoding genes involved in photosynthesis and protein synthesis represented the bulk of the genes preferentially expressed at day  <dig>  between days  <dig> and  <dig>  the plants transition from a two-dimensional protonemal network to three-dimensional structure containing leafy shoots, although by day  <dig> the leafy shoots were mostly still buds. along with this development, many new metabolism-related genes were expressed, which implied distinct metabolic pathways operate during this phase of gametophyte development.

by day  <dig>  a mature three-dimensional gametophyte consisting of leafy shoots and rhizoids was attained. interestingly, at this stage, a gene encoding a homologue of thale cress roothair defective  <dig>  was preferentially expressed. in arabidopsis, rhd <dig> encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein with gtp-binding motifs that is required for expansion of both roots and root hairs, and is implicated in the control of vesicle trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi compartments  <cit> .

a previous study by menand et al.  <cit>  suggested root hair defective  <dig> , a homologue of rhd <dig>  controls root hair development in arabidopsis and rhizoid development in p. patens. this result supports the hypothesis that early land plants were bryophyte-like and possessed a dominant gametophyte, and that later the sporophytes rose to dominance. furthermore, this finding suggests the increase in morphological complexity of the sporophyte body in the paleozoic resulted at least in part from the recruitment of regulatory genes from gametophyte to sporophyte.

comparison of the two protonemal cell types showed a number of genes related to protein synthetic installation, cell wall metabolism, photosynthesis and transport were specifically expressed in chloronema. this cell type forms initially and the more vigorous caulonema differentiate subsequently. the expression pattern of chloronema might indicate the primary function of these cells is to give rise to the caulonemal cells and it is the latter that take on diverse physiological functions and lead to the continued development of the gametophyte; in addition, accumulation of transcript products in chloronemal cells might contribute material and energy for caulonemal cell differentiation.

cell division genes
the gametophyte progresses from two or three cells at day  <dig> to tens of thousands of cells by day  <dig>  not surprisingly, many genes related to control of cell division were differentially expressed, among which were the following genes.

proteolysis is considered to be important steps in ensuring unidirectional progression of the cell cycle by triggering rapid degradation of target proteins that in turn drive the cycle forward  <cit> . the scf complex, consisting of skp <dig>  cullin, and f-box, could associate with e <dig> ligase and help to recruit and degrade the target proteins during the g1-s transition of the cell cycle  <cit> . in the present study, genes encoding skp <dig>  cullin  <dig> and cullin  <dig> were preferentially expressed after  <dig> days, which suggests a role for the scf complex pathway in the regulation of cell division in leafy shoots during gametophyte development in p. patens. the auxin response also depended on regulation of the scf e3-ubiquitin-protein complex  <cit> ; consequently, increased skp <dig> transcription might promote an endogenous auxin response and activate the cell division cycle.

expression of genes related to hormone signaling during gametophyte development
hormones regulate plant development by a complex signal response network. similar to higher plants, growth and development in p. patens is regulated both by environmental factors and phytohormones  <cit> . genes involved in the signaling pathway of three major plant hormones, namely auxin, ethylene and cytokinins, are discussed in this section. in the present study, eight preferential degs involved in the auxin signaling pathway were expressed from days  <dig> to  <dig> . of these, two genes that belong to the family of atp-binding cassette  transporters, abcb <dig> and abcb <dig>  were preferentially expressed at day  <dig>  in thale cress, the abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> proteins were required for polar transport of auxin   <cit> . in addition, the abcb <dig> protein possibly regulated auxin-dependent responses by influencing basipetal auxin transport in the root and influenced the auxin transport process that acts through cry <dig> or phyb to control hypocotyl growth during de-etiolation in seedlings  <cit> . auxin transport is mediated at the cellular level by three independent mechanisms that are characterized by the pin-formed , p-glycoprotein , and aux/lax transport proteins  <cit> . pin and abcb transport proteins, which are best represented by pin <dig> and abcb <dig> , coordinately regulate auxin efflux. when pin <dig> and abcb <dig> coincide on the plasma membrane, their interaction enhances the rate and specificity of auxin efflux, and the dynamic cycling of pin <dig> is reduced. this finding suggests abcb <dig> stabilizes pin <dig> localization at the plasma membrane in discrete cellular subdomains where pin <dig> and abcb <dig> expression overlaps  <cit> .

another important auxin response gene was auxin response factor  <dig> , of which one copy  showed maximal expression at day  <dig> . the other copy  showed peak expression in caulonema . the art <dig> gene, as a positive regulator, is involved in the crosstalk of auxin and light signaling pathways and auxin homeostasis and controls adventitious root initiation in arabidopsis  <cit> . a previous study suggests auxin promotes the development of caulonema cells in p. patens  <cit> . our results demonstrate auxin promotes growth and differentiation of caulonema and three-dimensional leafy shoots.

ethylene is a plant hormone that regulates many processes, such as seed germination, root hair development, fruit ripening and stress responses, in higher plants  <cit> . according to the model elaborated for arabidopsis  <cit> , ethylene is perceived by specific receptors that act as negative regulators of the ethylene response. five ethylene receptors, i.e., etr1/ein <dig>  ers <dig>  ein <dig>  etr <dig>  and ers <dig>  are present in thale cress and dominant negative mutants of each that confer ethylene insensitivity are reported  <cit> . the p. patens genome codes for six putative etr-like ethylene receptors and two putative 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate  synthases as well as two transcription factors, although there is no clear evidence that p. patens responds to ethylene  <cit> . we found a putative ethylene receptor  was preferentially expressed at day  <dig> and a putative ethylene insensitive gene  accumulated at day  <dig>  in arabidopis, ein <dig> functions as a nuclear transcription factor that initiates downstream transcriptional cascades for ethylene responses, including seedling de-etiolation, modulation of nitric oxide-related iron acquisition and homeostasis, and plant innate immunity  <cit> . therefore, we speculate the ethylene signaling pathway might also play a role during p. patens gametophyte development.

some reports suggest cytokinins are also important phytohormones involved in p. patens development, which can induce bud formation in mosses in a concentration-dependent manner  <cit> . in the present study only two genes involved in the cytokinin signaling pathway were identified. a putative cytokinin response factor  <dig>  and a putative chase domain-containing histidine kinase protein  showed maximal expression at day  <dig> and day  <dig>  respectively . these data provide clues to the molecular mechanism of developmental processes regulated by phytohormones in p. patens.

transcription factors
during protoplast regeneration into a gametophyte, more than  <dig> transcription factors show changed expression levels . among the differentially expressed transcription factors, several were preferentially expressed at day  <dig> . one of these encodes a putative bzo2h <dig> homologue, which belongs to the bzip transcription factor family. recently, bzo2h <dig> was reported to be a sensitive integrator of transient abscisic acid and glucose signals in arabidopsis  <cit> . another differentially expressed transcription factor is wrky <dig>  a putative homologue of the wrky transcription factor family  in arabidopsis. the wrky proteins are a superfamily of transcription factors with up to  <dig> representatives in arabidopsis. family members appear to be involved in the regulation of a variety of physiological processes unique to plants, including pathogen defense, senescence and trichome development  <cit> . we suggest, therefore, that these two transcription factors play a role in protoplast regeneration.

one transcription factor that showed peak expression on day  <dig> is a putative homologue of class iii homeodomain-leucine zipper  transcription factors, hb- <dig>  in thale cress, hb- <dig> binds to the promoters of genes predominantly expressed in vascular tissues  <cit> , and acts as a transcription factor in vascular meristems to promote proliferation of procambial cells and suppress their differentiation into vascular cells  <cit> . promoting proliferation while suppressing differentiation might be necessary to form the leafy gametophyte shoot on a physiologically appropriate time scale.

at day  <dig>  one of the preferentially expressed transcription factors was a member of the grf gene family, which comprises nine members including growth-regulating factor  <dig> . in arabidopsis, overexpression of atgrf <dig> and atgrf <dig> resulted in larger leaves and cotyledons, as well as in delayed bolting of the inflorescence stem when compared to wild-type plants  <cit> . it is possible that these transcription factors play similar roles in p. patens.

epigenetic modification and gametophyte development
protein methylation is one type of post-translational modification. histones that are methylated on certain residues can act epigenetically to repress or activate gene expression  <cit> . in the plant kingdom, protein methylation plays a fundamental role in the regulation of diverse developmental processes  <cit> . in the present study, two putative protein methylation-associated genes showed differential expression during protoplast regeneration into a gametophyte . of these genes, ste14b was preferentially expressed at day  <dig> and encodes a putative homologue of the isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase family, which is involved in post-translational processing of proteins with a c-terminal caax box  <cit> . a putative vip <dig> homologue exhibited maximal expression at day  <dig>  this gene is predicted to encode a transducin/wd <dig> repeat-like superfamily protein with a dwd motif, which is involved in protein complex formation. in arabidopsis, this gene is involved in the timing of flowering and flower development. loss-of-function of this gene leads to a redistribution of h3k4me <dig> and k3k36me <dig> modifications within genes but not a change in the overall abundance of these modifications within chromatin  <cit> . these expression results suggest epigenetic modification of proteins play important roles during gametophyte development in p. patens. further research is still needed to uncover the molecular mechanisms that control gametophyte development.

CONCLUSIONS
we analyzed the transcriptome during the transition between sequential developmental stages, and as cells differentiate, during gametophyte development of p. patens. the transcript levels of  <dig> genes were significantly increased or reduced, of which the majority changed only during a specific developmental stage or in an individual tissue type. our results provide an extensive catalogue of regulatory factors and related genes involved in cell division, growth, and differentiation during gametophyte development in p. patens. potential applications of these data include identification of candidate genes for evolutionary developmental studies, as targets for reverse genetic studies of plant development, and as tools for cell-by-cell mapping of genes involved in plant development.
