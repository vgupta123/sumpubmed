BACKGROUND
emerging evidence indicates that the regulatory pathways underlying sexual differentiation result in phylogenetically widespread transcriptional sex-bias in the brain of organisms ranging from d. melanogaster to humans  <cit> . we earlier uncovered an evolutionary conserved signature of sex-biased gene expression in the cortex of catarrhine primates including humans  <cit> . these results suggested that sexual differences present in adult human brain are in part genetically controlled and not solely attributed to environmental differences between the sexes. furthermore, we demonstrated that several genes on the y-chromosome are expressed in many regions of prenatal human male brain  <cit> , raising the possibility that expression of y-linked genes may be partially responsible for sexual dimorphism during early development in the human brain. moreover, sex-biased expression is partly conserved between mouse and human, suggesting that there is a common mechanism of transcriptional modulation of sex-bias operating across mammals.

the mechanisms by which sex differences in the brain are established and controlled during development are not understood in detail, but sex hormones clearly play major roles. however, sex hormones are not sufficient to explain all sex differences, and genes encoded in the sex chromosomes are also known to be important  <cit> . these genes include male-specific y-encoded genes as well as female-biased x-encoded genes that escape the dosage compensating inactivation of one x-chromosome in females. in mouse, only a few genes that escape x-inactivation have been identified  <cit> . these genes are known to produce female-biased expression very early during development  <cit> , but the molecular control mechanisms remain mostly unknown.

a genome-wide investigation of whole adult mouse brain and several peripheral tissues demonstrated that sexual dimorphism in gene expression is highly tissue specific  <cit> . however, sex-biased expression in distinct regions of the brain has not been previously investigated. since the brain is a highly heterogeneous and functionally compartmentalized structure, it is of interest to explore whether gene expression in distinct regions of the brain is regulated differentially in males and females. indeed, three-dimensional magnetic resonance microscopy in mice demonstrated sex-specific, post-puberty changes in brain structures  <cit> . furthermore, sex-specific functional differences in various brain regions, particularly the amygdala and hypothalamus, have been observed in both human and rodent  <cit> . given the implications of sex-biases for many neurological and psychiatric disorders  <cit> , the importance of studying sexually dimorphic gene expression in the brain is increasingly being realized.

in the present study, we investigated male and female gene expression in distinct structures of the mouse brain using genome-wide microarray analysis. the study unravelled sub-structure-specific sexual gene expression dimorphism in the mouse brain. our findings also include novel observations regarding the regulation of domains and genes escaping x-inactivation on the mouse x-chromosome.

RESULTS
sexually dimorphic gene expression in distinct brain regions
to investigate possible sub-structure-specific as well as potentially uniform sex-biased gene expression in the adult mouse brain, we assessed genome-wide rna expression in striatum, neocortex, hippocampus and eye from male and female mice using oligonucleotide microarrays. lung was included in the analysis to allow comparisons with a peripheral tissue. we reasoned that sex-biased transcription present both in brain and in a peripheral tissue would indicate wide-spread expression bias. this in turn would suggest a sex-biased control mechanism for these genes operating throughout the body and not specifically in the brain. two microarray platforms were used: illumina 6v <dig>  in case of striatum and neocortex and affymetrix m430v <dig>  in case of hippocampus, eye and lung. a total number of  <dig> microarrays were included in the study, comprising a balanced number of male and female samples in each tissue .

genes with sexually dimorphic rna expression were identified in striatum , neocortex , hippocampus , eye  and lung  using fdr ≤  <dig>  as significance criteria . the female to male fold changes in expression were statistically significant but small  in terms of mean and median values for most genes . only xist , prl  and genes located on the y-chromosome  showed female to male changes greater than two-fold in any of the brain tissues analysed.

we also investigated the chromosomal localization of sex-biased genes and observed a significant overrepresentation of x- and y-encoded genes in all tissues investigated . indeed, sexually dimorphic gene expression was almost exclusively restricted to genes located on the sex chromosomes in neocortex and hippocampus. interestingly, striatum contrasted with the other brain regions in terms of the wide chromosomal distribution of sex-biased genes as well as in terms of quantity of biased genes, with an order of magnitude increase in the number of sex-biased genes . this result demonstrated that sex-biased gene expression is not uniform throughout the whole brain, but rather differentially pronounced in diverse brain structures. since two similar but not identical microarray platforms were used in the study, direct comparisons of number of sex-biased genes and the estimated fold-changes of individual genes in each tissue should take differences between the platforms into account .

gene ontology and disease association analysis demonstrated that sex-biased genes in striatum are mainly related to brain-specific functions . therefore, the results suggest a possible molecular background behind well-known functional sex-differences in striatum.

common signatures of sex-biased gene expression in different brain regions
we investigated whether we could identify genes that are sex-biased in multiple tissues. the inventories of sex-biased genes in each tissue resulted in five lists . these lists were compared to identify genes that were sex-biased in more than one of the tissues included in the study . we found that nearly all of the genes that were sex-biased in multiple tissues are located on the x- and y-chromosomes. many of these sex chromosome encoded genes, listed as "known x, y-linked" in figure 2b, are already well documented in the literature in terms of sex-biased function and/or expression  <cit> . these genes include xist, which is essential for the onset of x-inactivation  <cit> , 2010000i03rik  which is located in the x-pairing region  <cit>  and several genes previously known to escape x-inactivation, including kdm5c, eif2s3x, kdm6a  and ddx3x. all x-linked genes named above were female-biased. we also detected male-biased expression of their y-linked paralogous genes: kdm5d, eif2s3y, uty and ddx3y. in addition to previously reported sex-biased genes, we identified five novel x-linked genes with up-regulation in female tissues: 2010308f09rik, d330035k16rik, 5530601h04rik, 2610029g23rik, and d930009k15rik . on the y-chromosome, we identified two novel male-biased genes: 4921530f17rik, up-regulated in male neocortex and striatum and c030026m15rik, up-regulated in male eye and lung tissues. among the genes encoded in autosomal chromosomes, we did not identify any transcript that was sex-biased in all brain structures . two autosomal genes were however sex-biased in both striatum and neocortex: prl , a gene that promotes lactation, and arid1b , a chromatin-remodelling factor. 1700012b15rik  was identified in both eye and lung.

thus, we conclude that genes commonly sex-biased in multiple brain structures are primarily attributed to the sex chromosomes. since most of the novel sex-biased genes that were differentially expressed in several parts of the brain are encoded in the x-chromosome, and since x-gene dose effects may indeed produce changes in brain function and behaviour  <cit> , we restricted further analysis to female-biased x-linked genes.

novel female-biased x-encoded genes code for long non-coding rnas
the function of the five newly identified x-linked female-biased genes, 2010308f09rik, d330035k16rik, 5530601h04rik, 2610029g23rik and d930009k15rik, is not known. cross-species blast indicated that only 2610029g23rik is conserved between mouse and human . the lack of human homologs for the other four genes suggested that they could be non-coding. to explore this possibility, we performed coding potential calculations based on sequence composition  <cit> . this analysis classified 2010308f09rik, d330035k16rik and d930009k15rik as non-coding . furthermore, 5530601h04rik and d930009k15rik were found as annotated non-coding rnas  in two ncrna databases, namely rna-db  <cit>  and noncode  <cit>  . the classification of the female-biased transcripts as non-coding was further strengthened by the lack of any significant hit of their sequences in the mouse refseq protein database . thus, four out of five of the newly identified female-biased x-linked transcripts are most likely long non-coding rnas , a class that is generally defined as ncrnas longer than  <dig> nucleotides  <cit> .

female up-regulated chromosomal domains that contain a lncrna and a protein-coding gene that escapes x-inactivation
all of the previously known female-biased genes on the x-chromosome that were identified in multiple tissues  escape, or are involved in the regulation of, x-inactivation  <cit> . of particular interest was that when we investigated the chromosomal localizations of the novel female-biased lncrnas, we observed that all of these non-coding genes are positioned close to female-biased coding genes on the x-chromosome . moreover, a closer examination revealed that three out of four female-biased lncrnas are proximally paired with female-biased coding genes that are known to escape x-inactivation . indeed, 2010308f09rik is located  <dig> kbp upstream of ddx3x and these two genes are encoded in a "head to head" orientation; d330035k16rik is positioned within an intron of eif2s3x and d930009k15rik is located  <dig>  kbp downstream of kdm5c. furthermore, the remaining female-biased non-coding gene, 5530601h04rik, is co-localized with the protein-coding and female-biased gene 2610029g23rik, and these genes are situated in a "head to head" arrangement separated by  <dig>  kbp .

quantitative rt-pcr experiments confirmed the female-biased expression of the above mentioned pairs of x-linked coding and non-coding genes in brain, eye and lung tissues  . one exception was 2010308f09rik, not confirmed as female-biased in lung, but evidently female-biased in brain and eye. female to male fold-changes were in the same range as detected in the microarray experiments, and in the expected range for x-inactivation escapee genes  <cit> . an x-linked negative control for sex bias, rps4x, which is inactivated on the silent mouse x-chromosome  <cit>  and therefore not expected to show female-biased expression, remained unchanged. a positive control for female-bias, xist, was highly female-biased  as expected.

the observation of female-biased domains in the mouse x-chromosome, containing a lncrna and a protein-coding gene that escapes x-inactivation, suggested that the female-biased gene pairs in each domain might be co-regulated. given the well known x-inactivation status of three out of four of the coding genes, we suspected that the three co-localized lncrnas might also escape x-inactivation. we could not find any data in the literature concerning the possibility that the fourth female-bias cluster, containing the coding gene 2610029g23rik and the non-coding gene 5530601h04rik may also escape x-inactivation. thus, we decided to study this cluster of two female-biased genes in more detail as described in the next section.

a novel domain that escapes x-inactivation in mouse
to investigate whether the chromosomal domain containing genes 2610029g23rik  and 5530601h04rik  escapes x-inactivation, we performed rna fish experiments in mouse cells, using a probe aimed at nascent rna from the genomic cluster that contains the 5530601h04rik and 2610029g23rik transcripts. in parallel, we included a probe for xist rna. we counted signals in  <dig> randomly chosen cells in which xist signals were detected. as expected, strong monoallelic xist signals were distinguished , marking the silenced x-chromosome. in contrast, signals from the novel female-biased cluster were biallelic in  <dig> % of the cells, monoallelic in  <dig> % of the cells and  <dig> % of the cells lacked signals . to verify that the detected nascent rna signals were derived from the locus containing 5530601h04rik and 2610029g23rik, we subsequently performed dna fish with probes aimed to their genomic locus and a second probe aimed to the xist locus . indeed, rna-dna fish experiments demonstrated that rna and dna signals for the female-biased cluster were overlapping . moreover, dna signals for the female-biased cluster and the xist locus appeared close, as expected given their short chromosomal distance. altogether, these results demonstrated that the newly identified female-biased cluster contains genes that escape x-inactivation in the majority of the cells.

biallelic expression of this novel cluster strengthens the association between female-biased lncrnas and domains that escape x-inactivation, and supports the possibility that female-biased lncrnas are biallelically transcribed. furthermore, this is supported by the lack of repressive chromatin mark, namely h3k <dig> tri-methylation , in the respective loci . h3k27me <dig> is apparently depleted not only in protein-coding x-inactivation escapee genes, but also in the co-localized female-biased lncrna genes. one of the lncrnas, 2010308f09rik, was located in the border region of h3k27me <dig> enrichment. this might explain why female-bias of this transcript was not detected in lung tissues, and why the female to male expression ratio of the co-localized gene ddx3x was consistently lower than the ratios for the other x-inactivation escapees in the quantitative rt-pcr analysis . we propose that female-biased lncrnas transcribe from domains that escape x-inactivation in mouse, suggesting possible control functions of lncrnas in such domains.

discussion
sex-biased gene expression differs regionally in the adult mouse brain
we observed a large difference in number and chromosomal localization of sex-biased genes between striatum and the other brain structures investigated, including neocortex, hippocampus and eye. these results suggest that sex differences are spatially regulated in distinct regions of the brain. a caveat to our tissue comparisons is that two similar but not identical array platforms were used in the study. therefore, "microarray platform" cannot be excluded as a confounding factor when making direct comparisons of number of sex-biased genes over the platforms. nevertheless, striatum clearly differentiated from neocortex in the amount and chromosomal locations of sex-biased genes, and these two tissues were analysed using the same platform. our results thus indicate that sex-biased gene expression is brain region-specific rather that uniformly controlled in the whole brain. whether only striatum, or also other additional regions are more sexually dimorphic than neocortex in terms of gene expression in the brain remains to be clarified. indeed, the possibility that specific sex differences in brain gene expression may occur in a spatially regulated manner has earlier been proposed based on the high heterogeneity in structure and function of the brain  <cit> . we propose that further analysis of regions well-known to be functionally dimorphic in males and females, such as the hypothalamus  <cit>  and the amygdala  <cit> , may show more pronounced sex-biased gene expression.

the chromosomal distribution of sex-biased genes in striatum contrasted with the observations in neocortex and hippocampus. in these tissues, sex-bias was essentially restricted to genes encoded in the x- and y-chromosomes. striatum is perhaps best known for its involvement in regulation of movement, reward and emotions, and studies in rodents showed sex differences in functions that are dependent on this brain structure  <cit> . the results of our study provide molecular support for the notion that striatum may be essential in controlling at least some aspects of sexually dimorphic behaviours and functions.

a general conclusion from our study of discrete brain regions is it that most female to male gene expression differences are less than two-fold. these results are in agreement with measurements obtained in whole mouse brain  <cit>  also showing expression differences less than two-fold for most genes. although small in magnitude, these expression changes are statistically highly significant. a challenge for the future is to functionally analyse possible consequences of these sexual gene expression biases in different regions of the brain, their establishment during brain development and their regulation by hormones and hormone-independent factors.

sex-biased expression of sex-linked genes throughout the brain
genes that were sex-biased in all brain regions included in the study were encoded exclusively in the x- and y-chromosomes. this suggests that sex-biased transcription throughout the adult brain is restricted to sex-linked genes. the sex-specific functions of these genes in the brain should be the subject of future analysis.

among autosomal genes, only two genes, namely prl and arid1b, were sex-biased in more than one brain region. prolactin has more than  <dig> separate functions in vertebrates  <cit>  and sex-biased functions are included among them. arid1b is a chromatin-remodelling factor with widespread expression  <cit> . increased expression of this gene in male brain, and its possible implications for sex-biased chromatin remodelling, remains to be investigated.

female-biased expression of lncrnas in chromosomal domains that escape x-inactivation
one of the most important outcomes of our study is the identification of four female-biased lncrna genes that are localized on the mouse x-chromosome close to female-biased protein-coding genes. these results define four female up-regulated chromosomal domains each of which contains a coding and a non-coding gene. a second important observation is that each of these x-chromosome domains contains genes that escape x-inactivation. indeed, three out of four female-biased coding genes  were shown to escape x-inactivation by other investigators  <cit> . our rna fish experiments demonstrated that also the fourth coding gene, 2610029g23rik, as well as the non-coding 5530601h04rik, are localized in a genomic region that escapes x inactivation. in addition, while the present article was under preparation, a second study demonstrated independently that 2610029g23rik escapes x-inactivation in a hybrid mus musculus × mus spretus cell line  <cit> . the non-random clustering of coding escapees and lncrna genes on the x-chromosome , the female biased expression of all of these genes, and the observed depletion of the repressive chromatin mark h3k27me <dig> in coding as well as in non-coding loci, supports the view that both coding and lncrna genes escape x-inactivation. in conclusion, our study indicates the presence of four domains in the mouse x-chromosome, containing a protein-coding gene and a lncrna, each of which escapes x inactivation.

previous studies of x-inactivation in humans showed that escapee genes are grouped in large gene clusters on the x-chromosome  <cit> , suggesting that escape mechanisms control continuous chromosomal domains. in mice, on the other hand, previously described escapee genes were interspersed and few, indicating that escape mechanisms control smaller regions or even single genes  <cit> . our results suggest that clusters of genes that escape x-inactivation also exist in mice, although the size of these domains is apparently smaller than in humans. escape mechanisms may be regulating both coding and non-coding genes collectively within confined domains in the mouse x-chromosome. it is possible that the female-biased lncrnas escape x-inactivation as a side effect of being located closely to functional protein-coding escapee genes. however, an alternative possibility is that the lncrnas themselves serve a function in the escaping domains, and this possibility will be discussed in the following section.

possible roles for long non-coding rnas in domains that escape x-inactivation
the mechanisms that control escape from silencing on the inactive x-chromosome remain cryptic. our observation of four chromosomal domains, each containing a female-biased coding and a non-coding gene, raises the possibility that lncrna are themselves involved in the regulation of x-chromosome domains that escape inactivation. although the functions of most lncrnas remain enigmatic, there is increasing evidence suggesting roles in epigenetic regulation  <cit> . recent reports showed that expression of lncrnas can remodel local chromatin and promote transcriptional activation of closely located genes  <cit> . for example, the expression of fbp <dig> in yeast was shown to be mediated by expression of 5' located lncrna transcripts, and accompanied by progressive opening of proximal chromatin  <cit> . another example is the activation of yeast pho <dig>  where the transcription of an intergenic, 3' located, antisense lncrna contributed positively to chromatin plasticity and nucleosome disassembly  <cit> . expression of lncrnas in domains that escape x-inactivation might regulate the expression of neighbouring protein-coding genes by similar mechanisms, involving relaxation of nucleosome complexes, increased accessibility for transcriptional machineries and recruitment of transcription factors that activate transcription in the domain.

other mechanisms of lncrna control in x-inactivation escaping domains are possible. for example, lncrnas may mediate movement of escapee domains to transcriptionally active compartments in the nucleus. similar lncrna-dependent movements were previously described, although towards transcriptionally silent compartments  <cit> . another described role for lncrnas involved the establishment of chromosomal boundaries between transcriptionally active and inactive domains  <cit> . by analogy, it is possible that transcription of lncrna in escaping domains mediates the formation of chromatin boundaries to restrict the spread of heterochromatin from neighbouring silent regions in the x-chromosome, thereby ensuring escape of the co-localized protein-coding genes.

the proposed hypotheses could be tested in the future by mutation or silencing of the lncrnas identified in our study.

x-linked lncrnas are known to be involved in multiple steps of control of the binary transcriptional state of the x-chromosomes in mammalian females, including initiation, establishment and maintenance of x-chromosome silencing  <cit> . the current report raised the possibility that lncrnas might act as gene expression modifiers in domains that escape x-inactivation. unlike proteins and small rnas, lncrnas can remain tethered to the site of transcription, and therefore uniquely direct allelic regulation  <cit> . this property could favour the choice of lncrnas as regulators of sexually antagonistic genes on the x-chromosome during evolution. selection for cis-acting modifiers of expression of sexually antagonistic genes on the x-chromosome is certainly predicted  <cit> . lncrnas as local expression modifiers in domains that escape x-inactivation may very well prove to be a novel example of such cis-acting elements in the x-chromosome.

sex chromosomes have evolved from autosomes independently many times in animals  <cit> . however, the main dilemma of dosage compensation and regulation of sexually antagonistic genes has been alike for each sex chromosome system  <cit> . it is possible that lncrnas may have evolved as a solution for allele-specific regulation of confined domains in several types of sex chromosomes. the fast sequence evolution of non-coding rnas  <cit>  could make these molecules suitable for regulation of sexually antagonistic genes. to evaluate this possibility, the roles of lncrnas in allele-specific regulation of genes encoded in the sex chromosomes should be studied not only in mouse but also in species with other sex chromosome systems.

CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate that the degree of sex-biased gene expression varies between distinct brain structures in adult mouse brain. in particular, striatum showed wider transcriptional sex-bias than neocortex both in terms of number of sex-biased genes and chromosomal distribution of these genes. more interestingly, we identified female-biased lncrna genes clustered on the x-chromosome with protein-coding genes that escape x-inactivation. these clusters are free of repressive histone marks, supporting the view that female-biased lncrnas are biallelically expressed in domains that escape x-inactivation. based on our observations, we propose that these lncrnas might modulate the epigenetic state of nearby coding genes.
