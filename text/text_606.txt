BACKGROUND
streptococcus agalactiae, also referred to as group b streptococcus , is a gram-positive, β-hemolytic, chain-forming coccus that comprises vaginal flora in 25% of healthy women  <cit> . it has been recognized as one of the major causes of pneumonia, meningitis in neonates  <cit> , mastitis in cows  <cit> , and meningoencephalitis in fish  <cit> . piscine gbs affects a variety of wild and cultured fish species worldwide, particularly in tilapia, and causes high mortality, resulting in large economic losses on fish farms  <cit> . since  <dig>  large-scale s. agalactiae infectious outbreaks have occurred continuously in tilapia farms in china  <cit> . the gbs isolate gd201008- <dig>  a highly virulent strain isolated from moribund cultured tilapia with meningoencephalitis in guangdong province of china in  <dig>  belongs to serotype ia, multilocus sequence type  <dig>   <cit> . this lineage serotype ia, st- <dig> gbs is associated with bloodstream infections in human neonates and adults  <cit> . the pathogenicity of human ia, st- <dig> isolates toward tilapia is well-established  <cit> . consumption of tilapia has been associated with an increased risk of s. agalactiae serotype ia and ib colonization in humans  <cit> .

to date, five complete genome sequences and  <dig> draft genome sequences of s. agalactiae have been made publicly available, including nine isolates of human origin, four of fish origin and two of bovine origin. in this study, we aimed to perform comparative analyses of these sequence data to identify virulence determinants, evolutionary relationships and the genetic basis associated with host tropism in streptococcus agalactiae.

RESULTS
characteristics of the 15 s. agalactiae genomes
the characteristics of the strains and their genomes utilized in this analysis are shown in table  <dig>  the strains represent different host tropisms , collected from china, north america, latin america and europe. the genome sizes range between  <dig>  to  <dig>  mbp , with a mean size of  <dig>  mbp. for piscine s. agalactiae, two chinese isolates, gd201008- <dig> and zq <dig>  share the same genome size , g + c content  and lineage serotype  with the human isolate a <dig>  sa20- <dig> and stir-cd- <dig>  isolated from fish in latin-america, have the smallest genomes, only  <dig>  mb encoding  <dig>  proteins and belong to ib, st- <dig> and ib, st- <dig>  respectively. the serotype ib, st- <dig> isolates belong to a fish-associated clonal complex that has never been reported from humans  <cit> .

identification of gene clusters
the observed pan-genome shared by the  <dig> strains consisted of  <dig> , genes including  <dig>  core genes,  <dig>  dispensable genes and  <dig>  unique genes. the core genes accounted for  <dig> % of cdss of these strains. accessory genes, including dispensable genes and unique genes, accounted for  <dig> % of the total cdss  from these  <dig> genomes; however, the distribution of accessory gene number in each strain varied considerably . a cog functional classification for core and accessary genes was also performed. only assigned cog functional genes were taken into account. figure 1b shows that accessory genes were most likely to be assigned to cog categories k , l , v , whereas core genes were more often associated with categories j . however, 66% of the accessory genes were not assigned a cog function, reflecting novel gene clusters and the limitations of cog classification.

the comparative analysis of genome elements
crisprs
crisprs  are a family of dna repeats that function like an adaptive immune response system, and are found in ~40% of bacteria. this system provides acquired immunity to exogenous dna from viruses and plasmids, representing a barrier to attack or genetic transformation. according to lopez-sanchez et al.  <cit> , there are two crispr/cas systems in the genome of s. agalactiae. type 1-c crispr <dig> is present in a few strains and type 2-a crispr <dig> is ubiquitous. blast results showed that the crispr <dig> components are missing or partially deleted in these  <dig> genome sequences. we then analyzed crispr <dig> sequences among the 15 s. agalactiae strains using the crisprs web server   <cit>  and modified the results according lopez-sanchez et al.’s findings  <cit> . the honduras fish isolates stir-cd- <dig> and sa20- <dig> did not contain any crispr sequences. as in the other strains, gd201008- <dig> carried an acknowledged conserved crispr/cas locus of subtype ii-a, with four cas genes  <cit> : cas <dig> , cas <dig> , cas <dig>  and csn <dig> . downstream of csn <dig>  there was a 564 bp crispr region of gd201008- <dig> comprising a 36 bp direct repeat and eight spacers. the crispr details of  <dig> strains are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

crispr spacers correspond to prior episodes of phage and plasmid exposure, and are inserted at the leader end of the crispr sequence, while the leader-distal end spacers are more conserved  <cit> . the sequence and position of spacers in the array could be used for limited ecological and epidemiological studies  <cit> . we identified  <dig> different spacer profiles from the 13 s. agalactiae strains with crispr <dig> sequences and grouped the strains according to the leader-distal spacers that corresponded to the most anciently inserted spacers  <cit> . to some extent, this allowed us to decipher phylogenetic relationships between strains. figure  <dig> shows that two chinese piscine strains, gd201008- <dig> and zq <dig>  and human isolate a <dig> share three identical spacers  in the leader-distal end. human strains 18rs <dig> and 2603 v/r share six homologous pacers . lopez-sanchez et al. showed that the variability of crispr <dig> sequences could reflect the population structure and dissemination of s. agalactiae isolates  <cit> . thus the strains sharing the same spacers were probably invaded by the same phage or plasmid, or lived in the same environment.

to identify the phages potentially targeted by crispr <dig> spacers, we searched for similar sequences in the ncbi nr database. a large number  of these  <dig> different spacers  were found that perfectly or imperfectly matched known integrative and conjugative elements , or prophages in other streptococcal genomes, especially in s. pyogenes . spacers from gd201008- <dig>  zq <dig> and human strains 2603 v/r,  <dig>  18rs <dig>  cjb <dig>  h36b, respectively, matched different regions of the s. agalactiae lytic phage jx <dig> genome . lytic phage jx <dig>  which specifically infects s. agalactiae, was isolated from the milk of mastitis-affected cattle in china by our laboratory  <cit> . s. agalactiae strains gd201008- <dig> and 2603 v/r are resistant when challenged by s. agalactiae phage jx <dig>  while a <dig> and atcc  <dig>  with no spacers matching phage jx <dig> in our study, is also resistant to jx <dig>  <cit> . the crispr/cas system appears to be active against phages; however, there remain many factors influencing the host range of phages.

prophages
with the exception of fish isolate sa20- <dig> and human isolates nem <dig> and coh <dig>  twelve strains contained prophage sequences. their features are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  gd201008- <dig> contained a 28 kb prophage encoding  <dig> cdss. subsequent global nucleotide alignment revealed that the prophage of gd20108- <dig> had high sequence identity  with the chinese tilapia isolate zq <dig> and the s. agalactiae a <dig> lambdasa <dig> prophage, while the location of prophages in these three strains was also similar . one difference among these three prophages is that a <dig> contains a putative internal attl site and an attr site at the end of the prophage. therefore, it is possible that gd201008- <dig>  zq <dig> and a <dig> exchanged the phage within a shared human or fish environment. other available fish s. agalactiae genomes do not appear share any common prophage genes with human isolates; therefore, it is also possible that chinese piscine strains gd201008- <dig> and zq <dig> were derived from a human source.

virulence factors in piscine strains
as pathogenic strains, a <dig> and piscine strains  encode most of the known s. agalactiae virulence factors . they contain several genes encoding adherence related proteins, such as fibrinogen-binding proteins , pilus islands , immunogenic bacterial adhesin  and invasion-associated protein .

there are three pilus island variants  in gbs that are associated with enhanced bacteria phagocyte resistance and systemic virulence  <cit> . four piscine strains carried the same pilus island type 2b , but no pi- <dig> or pi-2a, while human strain a <dig> has pi- <dig> and pi-2b. meanwhile, the pcr detection of the backbone of pilus islands pi- <dig>  pi- <dig> and pi-2b, as described  <cit> , were performed among  <dig> fish strains from three fisheries in china in our study. the results  were confirmed the former conclusion that at least one of the three pilus islands were present in each strain of s. aglactiae <cit> . the fish isolates in our study carried either pi-2b  or pi- <dig> plus pi-2b type , but no pi-2a. in human infection, there was a large proportion of gbs from adults that carry both pi- <dig> and pi-2a, and a greater number of strains in infants bearing both pi- <dig> and pi-2b  <cit> . this suggests that s. agalactiae probably changed its pili type under host immunological pressure to expand its capacity to infect different hosts. this hypothesis should be tested by examining the pilus type among hundreds of piscine isolates.

we also analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms  in genes surrounding the pi- <dig> locus. ten genes from the upstream and the downstream regions, respectively, of the a <dig> pi- <dig> locus were chosen to compare with the gd201008- <dig> genome. we identified  <dig> polymorphisms, comprising  <dig> non synonymous  snps,  <dig> synonymous  snps, and  <dig> deletions . the result showed that the absence of a pi-i locus was not the result of a simple deletion event, and may have occurred by recombination with a more distantly related genome.

other streptococcal virulence proteins, such as hyaluronidase, enolase, surface immunogenic protein , pneumococcal surface antigen a , c3-degrading protease, trigger factor and camp factor were identified in these five strains. two immunoreactive antigens, the alpha c protein , known to mediate gbs invasion of human cervical epithelial cells  <cit> , and the beta c protein , which binds human iga to evade human immune responses  <cit> , were only found in human strain a <dig> and chinese piscine isolates gd201008- <dig>  zq <dig>  a <dig>  gd201008- <dig> and zq <dig>  these strains are hemolytic and contain the complete hemolysin operon  in their genome, while sa20- <dig> and stri-cd- <dig>  which are non-hemolytic  <cit> , have an incomplete operon containing only the cyla, cylb and cyle genes. this suggests that the final secretion of hemolysin depends on the complete hemolysin operon, although cyle has been proposed to be the structural gene hemolysin of s. agalactiae <cit> . in addition, all the piscine s. agalactiae genomes lack the genes lmb and scpb, which encode laminin-binding protein and c5a peptidase, respectively. to date, no lmb or scpb genes have been published in the ncbi nr database that are derived from piscine s. agalactiae strains. this phenomena should be studied further in more piscine strains. thus, s. agalactiae has retained indispensable genes for survival and reproduction and has lost some nonessential genes during adaptation to various niches in different hosts.

core and pan-genome analysis of s. agalactiae
s. agalactiae core genome
the number of core genes found after the sequential addition of each new genome sequence was extrapolated by fitting an exponential decaying function to the data  <cit> . the number of shared genes initially decreased with addition of each new sequence. figure 4a demonstrates that the core genome size of 15 s. agalactiae strains is  <dig>  genes and is likely to decrease substantially with the sequencing of additional genomes. this result was different from the tettelin et al.’s study  <cit> , which showed that the core genome of eight human strains comprised  <dig>  genes and remained constant even when more genomes were added. the differences in the absolute numbers reflect the differences in methodology used to define orthology  <cit> , and the use of draft genome sequence data. to insure the robustness of our method, we also analyzed the core genes of these eight human strains. the result was  <dig> core genes, extremely closed to the results of lefebure‘s analysis of the core genes of the eight human strains   <cit> .

the genomes size of the two latin american fish strains, sa20- <dig>  and stir-cd- <dig>  was  <dig>  mbp, obviously smaller than the other  <dig> s. agalactiae strains. would these two strains cause decrease in the core genome size of s. agalactiae? we analyzed the core genome from  <dig> strains after removing these two strains. there were  <dig> core genes among the 13 s. agalactiae strains, much higher than  <dig> core genes from  <dig> strains. this  <dig> genes appear to have been deleted in the st260- <dig> strains genomes. the two latin american fish strains’ genomes decreased the core genome size of s. agalactiae in our study. from rosinski-chupin’s study  <cit> , specialized fish strains st260-261- <dig> are characterized by a strong reductive evolution, which led to the relaxation of the negative selection on genes that became dispensable, allowing the accumulation of larger deletions. these  <dig> core genes were also subjected to cog functional classification . unclassified cog functional genes were taken into account. among these  <dig> core genes, st260- <dig> fish strains were most likely to delete genes in cog categories g  and r , while the core genes among  <dig> strains were more often associated with r  and j  . these data suggested that in the evolution of the s. agalactiae strains specialized to fish, some proteins associated with carbohydrate transport and metabolism functions were deleted linking to host adaptation.

s. agalactiae pan-genome
for the pan-genome study, the number of new genes  was calculated every time a new genome was incorporated. the mean values of new genes were used to perform the extrapolation. similar to the core genes, the plot of new genes fitted well to a decaying function, and the extrapolated curve did not stabilize on a non zero asymptotic value before the genome number reached  <dig>  as shown in figure 4c. it meant that the number of new genes in s. agalactiae was not characterized by those  <dig> genomes and would tend to a non-zero asymptotic value when more genomes are added. figure 4b shows that our results agree with tettelin et al.’s: s. agalactiae possesses an open pan-genome whose size increases with the addition of new sequenced strains.

phylogenetic relationships among s. agalactiae strains from different sources
to investigate the phylogenetic relationships among these fifteen strains, we used the neighbor-joining  method to construct a phylogenetic tree  using the  <dig>  single copy orthology clusters of the fifteen strains. as expected, identical host origin strains showed close evolutionary relationships, such as fish sources , bovine sources  and human sources . serotype iii, st  <dig> human strains coh <dig> and gb <dig>  serotype ib piscine strains stir-cd- <dig> and sa20- <dig>  respectively belonged to the same evolutionary clade. human strain a <dig> and piscine chinese isolates gd201008- <dig> and zq <dig>  which belong to the same serotype and st , were also grouped into one evolutionary branch. this indicates that chinese fish strains gd201008- <dig> and zq <dig> were probably derived from the same recent common ancestor as human strain a <dig>  we then evaluated gd201008- <dig> and a <dig> at the genomic level . the whole genome alignment indicated that a <dig> has additional two prophage sequences , a pi- <dig> pilus locus and lmb-scpb locus, but lacked the chinese piscine s. agalactiae specific genes island. in general, the position of four piscine s. agalactiae strains  on the phylogenetic tree indicated that chinese piscine s. agalactiae strains were more closed related to human strains than to latin american fish strains.

specific genes among piscine strains
compared to the human gbs genomes,  <dig> orthologs were identified as specific to the piscine gbs genomes  and  <dig>  genes were annotated as encoding “hypothetical proteins”. among these  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes  were found only in a single strain,  <dig> belonging to gd201008- <dig>   <dig> belonging to zq <dig>  eight belonging to sa20- <dig> and  <dig> belonging to stir-cd- <dig>  there were no genes specifically shared by these four piscine strains. many of the piscine strain-specific genes  were partial, caused by base mutation or insertion elements. a strain-specific 10 kb gene island was found in chinese isolates gd201008- <dig> and zq <dig>  <cit> , which contains one lpxtg cell wall surface protein, one dna binding protein, one phage integrase, and eight hypothetical proteins. this 10 kb locus shows significant sequence similarity and identical gene order to the genome of streptococcus anginosus sk52/dsm  <dig> , which agreed with the results of rosinski-chupin et al.  <cit> . although some of the genes within this 10 kb island showed close sequence similarity to genes from other s. agalactiae strains, as well as tilapia strain stir-cd- <dig> and human strain gb <dig>  streptococcus anginosus sk52/dsm  <dig> was the only species that matched the entire region with high amino acid identity . streptococcus anginosus is part of the human bacteria flora, but can cause diseases, including brain and liver abscesses, under certain circumstances. this 10 kb locus in s. agalactiae may have been acquired from streptococcus anginosus and may contribute to the virulence of piscine strains.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, comparative genomic analysis among 15 s. agalactiae strains of different origins showed that the open pan-genome of these s. agalactiae comprises  <dig>  genes including  <dig>  core genome genes,  <dig> dispensable genes and  <dig> strain-specific genes. the latin american fish-specific strains sa20- <dig> and stir-cd- <dig>  belonging to st260- <dig>  decrease the core genome size of s. agalactiae and are quite distinct from chinese fish isolates gd201008- <dig> and zq <dig> at the genome level. except for core genes, no genes are specifically shared by these four piscine strains.

the chinese piscine s. agalactiae gd201008- <dig> and zq <dig>  belonging to st  <dig>  are very similar to their human counter-part, a <dig>  they are highly similar in the context of crispr, prophage, and virulence-associated genes, and share an extremely short evolutionary relationship in the phylogenetic tree. there is no evidence showing that humans could be infected by piscine s. agalactiae through wounds or consuming fish meat. however, attention must be paid to its potential threat to public health security because these st <dig> fish strains are not distinguished from their human counterparts. in addition to their genomic similarities, a transcriptome study of chinese piscine s. agalactiae will be performed to detect and compare gene expression with human st  <dig> strains in our future research.
