BACKGROUND
with the rapid development of space technology, space capsules are frequently launched to explore the universe; therefore, it is important to understand space biology. space environmental physics has elucidated the existence of properties including electromagnetic radiation, microgravity, high vacuum and strong magnetic field in the space environment; however, it is important to understand the impact of these factors on organisms. paul et al. focused on plants, which are significant components of biological systems, and discussed the adaption and growth tropism of plants in the microgravity environment in a space shuttle  <cit> . gridhani et al. examined proton-induced perturbations in gene expression, cell cycle and cell division as well as the differences between the effects of protons and high-energy proton radiation  <cit> . gao et al. observed that bacterial metabolism was significantly altered in the space environment  <cit> ; furthermore, exposure to the space environment might cause genetic damage  <cit> . tixador et al. studied the growth and antibiotic resistance of escherichia coli during the mission of the space shuttle discovery  <cit> . however, mutations caused by the space environment have not been examined at the genomic level. klebsiella pneumoniae is an important gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen that causes severe diseases such as septicemia, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and soft-tissue infections  <cit> . many clinical strains of k. pneumoniae are highly resistant to antibiotics, which poses a major threat to global public health. over the past decade, the physiology, biochemistry, and regulation of k. pneumoniae pathways have been extensively studied  <cit> . however, the effect of spaceflight on k. pneumoniae has not been examined at the genomic level. k. pneumoniae is well-suited for such studies because of its characteristics.

in  <dig>  the shenzhou viii spacecraft carried k. pneumoniae strains into outer space for approximately 17 days . the control strain was cultured at the same temperature in an incubator on earth. after spaceflight, the antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity of the strains were examined. based on these analyses, the lct-kp <dig> strain obtained after spaceflight was selected and compared to the control strain lct-kp <dig>  the genomes of lct-kp <dig> and lct-kp <dig> were sequenced to compare their genomic variations. these analyses revealed genes potentially related to drug resistance, and analysis of the putative drug-resistance genes revealed variations in the homologous genes in the two strains. studies on these candidate resistance genes will be important to improve understanding of the drug resistance of k. pneumoniae.

RESULTS
genomic features of the strains lct-kp <dig> and lct-kp289
the genome sequences of lct-kp <dig> and lct-kp <dig> were deposited in ncbi under the genbank accession numbers ajhe <dig> and atro <dig>  respectively. the genomes are described in table  <dig>  genome alignments revealed that most regions were present in both strains, including  <dig> alignment blocks that covered  <dig> % of the lct-kp <dig> genome and  <dig> % of the lct-kp <dig> genome. the strain lct-kp <dig> exhibited a larger genome size, and the extra sequences mainly comprised repetitive sequences .

based on the assembly results, the genes in strains lct-kp <dig> and lct-kp <dig> were predicted and annotated using cogs . using this analysis,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were assigned to specific gene functions in strains lct-kp <dig> and lct-kp <dig>  respectively . genome alignment revealed that most genes in lct-kp <dig> were present in lct-kp <dig> and that the additional genes in lct-kp <dig> were most likely repeated sequences. the unique genes in these strains are discussed below. the predicted genes were annotated using the ardb , and  <dig> and  <dig> genes were assigned antibiotic-resistance functions in lct-kp <dig> and lct-kp <dig>  respectively. the assembly results were then annotated using plasmid databases, and some scaffolds in lct-kp <dig> and lct-kp <dig> were homologous to plasmid genomes. the plasmid annotation analysis revealed that some plasmids did not belong to k. pneumoniae . however, the presence and origin of these plasmids require further analysis.

detection of genomic structural variations and functional enrichment of variant genes
the genomic variations in lct-kp <dig> and lct-kp <dig> were analyzed and the genomic differences, including sequence variants, were identified . we defined variant genes as those that contained snps or indels, were partly located in syntenic or repeat regions, or were unpaired . subsequently, the variant genes in strains lct-kp <dig> and lct-kp <dig> were annotated using the cog/go/kegg databases and classified by their functions .analysis of genome variation revealed  <dig> inversion,  <dig> deletions,  <dig> insertions,  <dig> translocation and  <dig> translocations with inversions . genes outside syntenic regions  were identified, including  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively, in lct-kp <dig> and lct-kp <dig>  in addition, the two strains contained some homologous genes. after filtering the homologous genes, we observed  <dig> and  <dig> unique genes in lct-kp <dig> and lct-kp <dig>  respectively. based on cog annotations, the functional categories “lipid transport and metabolism”, “inorganic ion transport and metabolism” and “secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism” were significantly enriched in the unique genes in lct-kp289; the functional category “inorganic ion transport and metabolism” was significantly enriched in the unique genes in lct-kp <dig> . furthermore, we detected  <dig> interspersed repeated sequences with duplication units longer than 400 bp, and the copy numbers of the repeated sequences were different. the genes located in the repeat regions were not significantly enriched in cog or kegg functional categories; however,  <dig> gene functional categories were enriched based on go annotations, including “fatty acid metabolic process”, “peptidoglycan biosynthetic process”, and “peptidoglycan-based cell wall” .

in addition to the large-scale genome variations,  <dig> snps were identified . to analyze the genes affected by snps, we selected snps located in cds or intergenic regions no further than 300 bp from the nearest gene. we observed that  <dig> and  <dig> genes were affected by snps in lct-kp <dig> and lct-kp <dig>  respectively. furthermore,  <dig> indels were also identified . indel-affected genes were identified using the method described for snps;  <dig> and  <dig> genes were affected by indels in lct-kp <dig> and lct-kp <dig>  respectively . based on the go annotations,  <dig> and  <dig> functional categories were enriched in the genes containing snps and indels, respectively, in the strain lct-kp <dig>  most of the affected genes encoded molecular functions related to transmembrane transporters . based on kegg annotations, the unique gene kp214_ <dig> in lct-kp <dig> was assigned the function “glycerolipid metabolism ” ; this gene contained  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels. kp214_ <dig> encodes dihydroxyacetone kinase , which is required to generate atp and nadh for microbial growth  <cit> . however, this gene was not functional in lct-kp <dig> because of a nonsense mutation . this mutation in lct-kp <dig> might have been caused by the severe environmental changes during spaceflight.

analysis of phylogenetic relationships
to understand the effect of the environment on strain evolution, the phylogenetic relationship between lct-kp <dig> and lct-kp <dig> was analyzed, and the base substitution rates were compared. we downloaded five other k. pneumoniae genome sequences from ncbi  and used bayesian analysis to generate phylogenetic trees at the whole-genome  and gene levels . the base substitution rates in lct-kp <dig> and lct-kp <dig> were  <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig> e- <dig>  respectively, at the genome level, and 5e- <dig> and  <dig> e- <dig>  respectively, at the gene level. therefore, lct-kp <dig> had higher base substitution rates at the genome and gene levels. we used the phylogenetic trees and  <dig>  core genes of the seven k. pneumoniae strains  to calculate the dn/ds ratios in lct-kp <dig> and lct-kp <dig> using the codonml software  with the gy-hky model. comparison of lct-kp <dig> and lct-kp <dig> revealed that most genes in these strains shared the same selection pressure, and the dn/ds value of most of the genes was greater than  <dig> , which indicated that the strains tended to have greater diversity under special circumstances, such as spaceflight.

furthermore, heterozygotic snps, which might reflect differential rates of evolution, were observed in these two strains. we mapped the reads to the assembly results and selected bases with a query value greater than  <dig> to analyze snp heterozygosis. we selected heterozygotic snps that satisfied the following criteria: frequency of the second-most abundant nucleotide greater than  <dig>  and total depth greater than 50x. the comparison of the base frequencies in the core genomes of strains lct-kp <dig> and lct-kp <dig> is shown in figure  <dig>  we observed that most base types were stable in lct-kp <dig>  but strain lct-kp <dig> had increased base-type diversity. the statistics of the annotation results in table  <dig> indicated that most heterozygotic snps were nonsynonymous. the analysis also revealed that the k. pneumoniae bacterial colonies had greater genome variation after spaceflight.

characterization of drug-resistance and related genes
spaceflight can cause genome variation that leads to alterations in bacterial drug resistance  <cit> . we measured the growth rates and characterized the drug resistance phenotypes of strain lct-kp <dig> after spaceflight and of the ground-control strain lct-kp <dig>  both strains had similar growth curves . however, the two strains differed in their resistance to sulfamethoxazole; lct-kp <dig> was resistant to this compound, but lct-kp <dig> was not. both strains exhibited similar resistance to benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, lincomycin, vancomycin, chloramphenicol, and streptomycin .

the sulfonamide sulfamethoxazole might inhibit dihydrofolate synthetase and repress dna synthesis in k. pneumoniae. to identify the sulfamethoxazole-resistance mechanism in lct-kp <dig>  we analyzed the ardb annotation results and observed that the sul <dig> gene, which is important for sulfonamide resistance, was duplicated. lct-kp <dig> had only one copy of sul <dig> , but lct-kp <dig> had two copies of this gene . sul <dig> encodes an alternative dihydrofolate synthetase that is not inhibited by sulfonamide; therefore, sulfonamides cannot block the synthesis of dihydropteroate, leading to sulfonamide resistance  <cit> . plasmid annotation analysis revealed that the scaffolds containing the sul <dig> gene were homologous to plasmid genomes . as the sul <dig> gene is mostly associated with class  <dig> integrons, we decided to explore the genetic context of sul <dig>  in both strains, the sul <dig> gene was part of a class  <dig> integron . integrons can capture gene cassettes by site-specific recombination and drive the expression of these genes. integrons are present in plasmids or transposons  <cit> , which leads to the spread of drug-resistance genes. in addition to the integrase  gene, class  <dig> integrons usually contain genes encoding resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds, ethidium bromide  and sulfonamides   <cit> . in this study, lct-kp <dig> and lct-kp <dig> contained resistance integrons , which included the gene emre  and other resistance genes such as ant  . in addition to integrons, transposon resolvase  and the gene ampc were observed near the sul <dig> gene. ampc encodes a class a beta-lactamase, which confers resistance to penicillin, cephalosporin-ii and cephalosporin-i. in addition,  <dig> genes in lct-kp <dig> and  <dig> genes in lct-kp <dig> were assigned to ardb, and these genes are important for k. pneumoniae antibiotic resistance .

discussion
based on the assembly results, the genome of lct-kp <dig> was larger than that of lct-kp214; genome alignment and prediction of genome elements revealed that the extra sequences in lct-kp <dig> were from tandem repeat fragments and interspersed repeated sequences. analysis of genome variation revealed that lct-kp <dig> contained more unique genes than lct-kp <dig>  go functional annotation revealed that the unique genes of lct-kp <dig> were enriched in  <dig> functional items, including oxidation-reduction, biofilm formation, and arginine catabolism. therefore, the genomic changes in lct-kp <dig> were related to environmental adaptation. we analyzed the evolutionary rate and phylogenetic relationships of lct-kp <dig>  the base frequencies of the core genomes revealed a greater number of heterozygotic snps in lct-kp <dig> compared to lct-kp <dig>  the phylogenetic trees at the genome and gene levels indicated that lct-kp <dig> had a greater base-substitution rate. the dn/ds analysis revealed that most genes in lct-kp <dig> had dn/ds values greater than  <dig>  together, these data indicated that special environmental factors can stimulate base substitutions in bacteria and that environmental selection pressure might influence the direction of bacterial evolution  <cit> .

to identify the genes that were most affected by the environment, the variant genes in lct-kp <dig> and lct-kp <dig> were annotated using the cog, kegg and go databases. these annotations revealed that some functional categories were enriched in lct-kp <dig> compared to lct-kp214; these categories were related to bacterial metabolism such as “lipid transport and metabolism”, “inorganic ion transport and metabolism” and “secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism”. however, using kegg annotation, lct-kp <dig> lacked the dihydroxyacetone kinase gene, which is important for the generation of atp and nadh, because of a premature stop codon  <cit> . therefore, we propose that, in lct-kp <dig>  mutations occurred more frequently in genes related to environmental adaptation.

k. pneumoniae is highly pathogenic and encodes multiple types of drug resistance genes. in this study, we analyzed the drug-resistance phenotypes of lct-kp <dig> and lct-kp <dig>  both strains were resistant to several drugs, except sulfamethoxazole, and lct-kp <dig> was more resistant to this drug than was lct-kp <dig>  based on genome alignment and ardb annotation, we observed that lct-kp <dig> contained an extra copy of the sul <dig> gene in scaffold <dig>  sul <dig> encodes an alternative form of dihydrofolate synthetase, which cannot be inhibited by the drug  <cit> . therefore, environmental selection pressure might cause genome variations, leading to an additional copy of the sul <dig> gene in lct-kp <dig> and subsequent enhanced drug resistance.

furthermore, we observed gene elements related to antibiotic resistance in k. pneumoniae. integron determinants, including gene cassettes and several antibiotic-resistance genes , were observed in both strains. antibiotics can be divided into four classes based on their mechanism of action: i) repression of bacterial cell-wall synthesis, ii) destruction of the cell membrane structure, iii) repression of protein synthesis, and iv) repression of dna synthesis. emre encodes an efflux pump that confers multidrug resistance  <cit> . the protein encoded by the gene ant potentially modifies aminoglycosides by adenylation, conferring resistance to protein synthesis inhibitors such as spectinomycin, streptomycin, tobramycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin  <cit> . because integrons are mobile genetic elements, the antibiotic genes contained in integrons can be transferred among different strains. based on plasmid annotation, we observed that the integrons in lct-kp <dig> and lct-kp <dig> might originate from escherichia coli plasmids. we observed the gene ampc, which encodes beta-lactamase, flanking the integrons. this enzyme can inactivate cell-wall synthesis inhibitors such aspenicillin and cephalosporin  <cit> . furthermore, the tn <dig> resolvase was observed near the integrons, which might enhance the mobility of the antibiotic-resistance genes. other antibiotic-resistance genes, including those related to polymyxin and bacitracin, were dispersed in the genome of k. pneumoniae.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, comparative genomics was used to analyze the strain lct-kp <dig>  which was selected after spaceflight, and the ground-control strain lct-kp <dig> to identify the relationship between the unique space environment and genome variation; furthermore, the potential rate of evolution was studied using phylogenetic analysis. we observed that the space environment affected the evolutionary rates of environment-related genes. phenotypic analysis revealed that lct-kp <dig> had increased resistance to sulfonamides, potentially due to an increased copy number of the gene sul <dig>  furthermore, the observation of integrons in k. pneumoniae provides insight into the mechanism of multidrug resistance. the hmp data have shown that the bacteria were multidrug resistant and highly pathogenic. therefore, this study paves the way for future studies on the effect of spaceflight on drug resistance and pathogenicity.
