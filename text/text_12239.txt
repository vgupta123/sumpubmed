BACKGROUND
breast cancer is the most common form of malignancy among women in almost all of europe and in north america. each year over one million women worldwide are diagnosed with the disease and it causes over  <dig>  deaths annually. much of the current translational research in this area is based on "transcriptomics", the elucidation of the transcriptional programs underlying disease initiation, promotion and progression, through tumour gene expression profiling. real-time quantitative pcr   <cit>  is one of the most sensitive and specific quantitation methods for gene expression analysis and is firmly established as a mainstream research tool  <cit> . with the development of high throughput and reliable instrumentation, improved detection chemistries, more efficient protocols and appropriate analysis software, rq-pcr has become the basis of many breast cancer biomarker studies as well as several novel diagnostic and prognostic assays  <cit> . in addition, rq-pcr is used to validate microarray expression profiles and quantify genes of interest identified from those analyses.

the most commonly used method to quantify gene expression involves the analysis of target gene expression relative to a control gene. as in other relative gene expression analysis techniques such as northern blotting and ribonuclease protection assays , normalisation of rq-pcr data is required to control for variation introduced during the steps from rna extraction to quantitation, especially to control for differences in the quantity and quality of rna used in reactions  <cit> . the use of endogenous control  genes, known variously as housekeepers, reference or simply control genes is based on the principle that these genes are expressed constitutively and uniformly in all test samples, so that expression of the target gene can be normalised against them to control for systematic variation in sample handling. results are then expressed as the ratio of target gene expression relative to the ec gene. in many cases, control genes are inherited from earlier studies using less sensitive forerunner techniques such as northern blotting and little if any consideration has been paid to validating these genes as controls for specific experiments.

two of the most commonly used endogenous control genes for breast cancer gene expression studies are glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  and β-actin  but their reliability in this context has not been demonstrated. in some studies the use of either gene may be inappropriate, as these genes have been implicated in aspects of disease aetiology  <cit> . for example, bisphosphonates; used to inhibit bone resorption in diseases including osteoporosis, paget's disease and metastatic breast cancer, target gapdh, decreasing its expression in both breast and prostate cell lines  <cit> , while the actin filament protein family, of which actb is a member, may be modulated in malignancy  <cit>  particularly during processes involving reorganisation of the cytoskeleton such as invasion and migration.

the precision of the estimate of change in target gene expression is dependent on the stability of the endogenous control, the variability associated with the target gene and any covariance between the two. thus the use of non-validated endogenous control genes results in, at best, unreliable data. it is now recognised that a universal, invariably expressed gene is unlikely to exist  <cit>  and may not exist even within individual tissue or cell types. the goal therefore is to identify the most reliable gene or set of genes as endogenous controls for a particular experiment. as a result of this, several groups have developed statistical models and software programs for the analysis of candidate gene stability. the aim of this study was to identify the most stable endogenous control genes from a panel of eleven candidates commonly used as endogenous controls in the context of, but not limited to, breast cancer: gapdh, tfrc, abl, ppia, hprt <dig>  rplp <dig>  b2m, gusb, mrpl <dig>  pum <dig>  psmc <dig>  for the quantification of gene expression by relative comparative rq-pcr in primary breast cancer tissues. the oestrogen receptor alpha  transcript, a gene of special significance in breast cancer, was used as a target gene to compare the effect of choice of ec on the estimate of gene quantity.

RESULTS
to identify suitable ec genes for breast cancer gene expression studies in fresh-frozen primary tissue, a panel of  <dig> genes commonly used as ecs was selected from the literature for analysis of stability: gapdh, tfrc, abl, ppia, hprt <dig>  rplp <dig>  b2m, gusb, mrpl <dig>  pum <dig> and psmc <dig>  genes were analysed in tumours recovered from patients with benign or malignant breast disease using rq-pcr. stability of candidate ec genes was analysed using two statistical analysis tools, genorm and normfinder, which employ different statistical models to define the most reliable ec genes for normalisation. the effect of choice of ec gene on target gene expression was analysed using esr <dig> as target.

range of expression of candidate ec genes and esr1
the candidate ecs displayed a range of ct values. mean ct values per gene and the range of ct values for each gene are shown in table  <dig>  mean ct values ranged from  <dig>   for b2m to  <dig>   for mrpl <dig> mrpl <dig> showed the narrowest range followed by ppia. the genes broadly fell into two categories, those highly expressed with mean ct values of 19– <dig>  and moderate abundance genes with mean ct values of 23– <dig> . the target gene esr <dig> showed the broadest range of ct values  from  <dig> – <dig> .

with conversion of ct values to relative quantity values , there was no difference in candidate ec gene quantities between benign and malignant tissues . there was however, a significant difference in variance between genes  indicative of differing stabilities of the candidates.

analysis of ec gene stability
the significant difference in ec variability demonstrated the necessity to validate their use in this context. expression stability was analysed using the two softwares genorm  <cit>  and normfinder  <cit> .

genorm uses a pair-wise comparison-based model to select from a panel of candidate ec genes, the gene-pair showing least variation in expression ratio across samples. it calculates a measure of gene stability  of each gene based on the average pairwise variation between all tested genes. genes with the lowest m values are those demonstrating most stable expression. table  <dig> shows the m values for all tested genes. eight of the eleven genes analysed; ppia, mrpl <dig>  gapdh, pum <dig>  b2m, hprt <dig>  psmc <dig> and tfrc, showed m values less than the genorm default threshold of  <dig> , while the three remaining genes; rplp <dig>  gusb and abl, showed m values greater than that threshold. in a stepwise progression, genorm excludes the least stable gene, recalculating m for the remaining genes, resulting in the characterisation of the stability of each gene on a ranked scale and ultimately the identification of the two most stably expressed genes . as shown,abl and gusb were the first and second genes respectively excluded from the analysis on the basis of instability and mrpl <dig> and ppia were identified as most stable gene-pair.

bhigh expression stability is indicated by a low stability value. for genorm, stability is based on an estimate of the pairwise variation  relative expression while for normfinder, stability is based on combined inter- and intra-group variation.

genorm also calculates a normalisation factor  required to determine the optimal number of ec genes required for accurate normalisation. this factor is calculated using the variable v as the pairwise variation  between two sequential nfs . to meet the recommended cut off v-value of  <dig> , the point at which it is unnecessary to include additional genes in a normalisation strategy  <cit> , the programme indicated the use of  <dig> of the six most stable genes i.e., mrpl <dig>  ppia, gapdh, pum <dig> and b2m . however, there was no significant effect on relative quantity of esr <dig> expression using the  <dig> gene panel of mrpl <dig>  ppia, b2m gapdh and pum <dig>  compared to the two-gene combination of mrpl <dig> and ppia .

stability of gene expression was also analysed using normfinder  <cit> . this programme uses a combined estimate of the intra- and inter-group variation to determine the most stably expressed candidate ec gene and gene-pair. table  <dig> shows the ranking of the candidates. as for genorm, normfinder identified mrpl <dig> and ppia as the most stable pair of genes and mrlp <dig> as the single most stable gene.

associations between candidates ec genes and esr1
the genorm programme assumes no co-regulation of candidate ecs as obviously this would lead to an erroneous choice of optimum normaliser pair. as stated above, to our knowledge the candidate ecs tested in this study are functionally independent. in addition co-variance between target gene and ec would affect results. regression analysis demonstrated significant, negative, linear associations between the relative quantities  of the target gene, esr <dig> and two commonly used ecs; tfrc  and hprt <dig> . in addition there was a significant linear association between qrel. of esr <dig> and abl described by the equation: abl =  <dig>  +  <dig>  esr1; r <dig> =  <dig> ;p =  <dig> . there was no association between esr <dig> and either mrpl <dig> or ppia .

effect of ec on esr <dig> relative gene expression
there was no effect of choice of ec on the relative quantity of esr <dig>  probably due to the large variation associated with the expression of esr <dig> compared to any of the ec genes as shown in fig.  <dig>  however, there was a significant effect of ec gene on the estimate of the error associated with relative gene expression . the magnitude of the error was significantly reduced using mrl <dig> and ppia as a combined endogenous control compared to the use of abl, b2m, gapdh, gusb, hprt <dig>  psmc <dig>  ppia, pum <dig>  rplp <dig> and tfrc. while there was no difference in error using mrpl <dig> and ppia in combination compared to mrpl <dig> on its own , there was a trend towards a reduction in the estimate of the error using the combined normalising factor. there was a significant increase in relative quantity of esr <dig> in malignant versus benign breast tissues compared to normal breast tissue .

discussion
to our knowledge this is the first systematic evaluation of the reliability of a large number of genes used as endogenous controls for rq-pcr analysis in breast cancer studies. the literature cites just two articles in relation to the evaluation of ec genes for breast cancer  <cit> . however, one study characterised ecs not in primary breast tissues but in cell lines  <cit>  and the other, while employing primary breast tissues, compared just two commonly used ec genes with other genes selected from a microarray dataset of breast cancer tissues and cell lines, as well as cell lines of different origins  <cit> .

quantitative pcr is the basis of most nucleic acid-based breast cancer biomarker studies and its potential clinical utility is foretold by the development of the oncotype dx assay . this 21-gene assay can predict metastatic recurrence  <cit>  and magnitude of response to chemotherapy  <cit>  in tamoxifen-treated er-positive early breast cancer patients. rq-pcr will undoubtedly feature prominently in the move toward personalised medicine so the necessity of validating ecs in clinical samples as opposed to cell lines is clear. the diversity of the tissues used in this study in terms of histological and clinical parameters  makes the results of interest to a broad spectrum of the breast cancer research community. with the exception of abl, used as an ec in other settings  <cit> , genes were selected for evaluation based their prior use in breast cancer studies, to determine the most reliable ec of those used in this field. certain genes were excluded based on evidence that their use in this context is inappropriate  <cit> .

validation of ec genes raises the circular issue of how to normalise normalising genes. this issue governs the validity of the conclusions of such studies so at each stage of this experiment sources of non-biological variation were minimised and data were scaled relative to a calibrator. for example, rna integrity, quality and purity were stringently analysed. a threshold rin value of  <dig> was applied, below which samples were excluded from analysis. this aspect is of importance given the relationship between rna integrity and expression quantitation  <cit> . duplicate cdna reactions were performed and genes were amplified in triplicate using more stringent cut-offs for replicate variability than recommended elsewhere  <cit> . in addition, the efficiency of amplification of each assay was determined  and data were corrected appropriately. determination of assay efficiency is critical in comparing gene expression  <cit>  but has not been addressed in similar studies  <cit> . cycle threshold  data were scaled relative a pooled normal tissue calibrator. similar studies describe the comparison of genes based on raw ct values  <cit> , an inappropriate approach as discussed below and elsewhere  <cit> .

there was no effect of tissue type on ec expression, validating comparison of their stability. this is an essential but often overlooked precursor analysis when using genorm and normfinder  <cit>  since these methodologies assume the candidates are not differentially expressed between experimental groups. there was however a significant difference in variance between candidates , with genes such as rplp <dig>  trfc, hprt <dig> and gapdh showing greater variance than others e.g., mrpl <dig> and ppia. since the resolution of rq-pcr is defined by the variance associated with the ec  <cit>  these results emphasise the necessity to evaluate and validate ec genes.

a single universal ec is unlikely to exist  <cit>  and since the function of most genes is largely unknown it is impossible to predict their expression under different experimental conditions. the use of more than one ec hedges the bet and increases the accuracy of quantitation compared to the use of a single ec  <cit> . studies show substantial errors, up to  <dig> -fold, in expression quantitation using single as opposed to multiple ec genes  <cit> . in this study, stability of expression was analysed using two distinct statistical models, a pairwise comparison model, genorm, and an anova-based model, normfinder. the genorm applet selects from a panel of genes, the pair showing least variation in expression ratio across samples and estimates the minimum number of genes required for optimal normalisation. normfinder estimates stability values for ecs considering combined intra- and inter-group variation and identifies the most stable gene and gene-pair, where the stability of the pair exceeds that of the single gene. despite their differences both models identified mrpl <dig> and ppia as the most reliable ecs while rplp <dig>  gusb and abl were least reliable. this result reflects those of the equality of variance analysis and, broadly, ranking by range of ct values . however, the ranking of genes by ct range and by the model-based methods differed for some genes e.g., gapdh, demonstrating the necessity to scale and correct raw cts for amplification efficiency before analysis. genorm indicated that optimal normalisation could be achieved using the five most stable genes but there was no difference in esr <dig> gene expression using this approach as opposed to the two-gene combination. while it is not known whether this would hold for other less variable target genes, cost and sample availability are limiting factors for most studies so the two-gene combination may be more practical for most applications.

the effect of using less stable ecs was assessed using esr <dig> as a target gene. due to the high variability of the expression of this gene  there was no effect of ec on quantitation. without further discussion of the relevance of the differential expression of esr <dig> in benign and malignant tissues; a gene whose role in breast cancer is widely appreciated, it is likely that had the target gene shown a more discreet change in gene expression, an effect of ec on quantitation would have been apparent. there was however a clear tendency for esr <dig> expression to change depending on ec . in the benign samples esr <dig> could be made to appear up- or down-regulated depending on ec, while its expression in the malignant samples could be numerically altered by one order of magnitude – artifactual results due simply to the choice of ec. clearly this type of error is unacceptable, especially in the analysis of markers for potential clinical application.

furthermore, there was a significant effect of ec on the magnitude of the error associated with the estimate of esr <dig> expression. the use of the mrpl <dig>  ppia combination minimised the error compared to all other ecs with the exception of mrpl <dig>  apart from the fact that the use of single ec genes can compromise data as already described, the use of either gene alone is not recommended for two further reasons. firstly, genorm identified them based on a pairwise comparison model so their individual use is inconsistent with that analysis method. as shown in fig.  <dig>  esr <dig> expression can be made numerically increase or decrease in the benign groups if these genes are used singly. secondly, stability, as assessed by normfinder, increased roughly  <dig> percentage points, from  <dig>  using mrpl <dig> alone to  <dig>  using it in combination with ppia indicating improved reliability of the two-gene combination  <cit> .

one previous study analysed ec stability in primary breast tissue  <cit> . that study compared two traditionally used ecs, gapdh and actb and four genes identified in microarray studies  <cit> : mrpl <dig>  pum <dig>  psmc <dig> and sf3a <dig>  the authors recommended mrpl <dig> be used with psmc <dig> and pum <dig>  however, in the present study, ppia, which was not assessed by szabo and colleagues, showed greater stability than psmc <dig> and pum <dig>  of the genes analysed in this study, ppia ranked first and second by normfinder and genorm respectively compared to fifth and seventh for psmc <dig> and eighth and fourth for pum <dig>  the reason ppia did mot emerge as a candidate in szabo and colleagues' microarray study is unclear. as part of their selection procedure, data was filtered to remove near background signals from low abundance genes yet in this study ppia showed the third highest mean ct value. cohort-specific effects are also unlikely since the tissues are broadly similar in terms of their clinical and histological parameters. apart from the obvious differences in the quantitative capacities of microarray and rq-pcr technology, a possible explanation is that the cohort from which these authors selected their candidates was not breast cancer-specific and included tissue from metastatic breast cancer lymph nodes and cell lines from an assortment of origins including dermal, leukemic, umbilical and melanoma samples  <cit> .

this study also analysed associations between genes. an assumption of the genorm model is that candidate ecs are not co-regulated yet the analysis of such genes by that method would lead to an erroneous choice of best gene-pair. to our knowledge the ec genes evaluated here are functionally independent as shown in table  <dig>  in addition, covariance of target and ec is clearly unacceptable. however, regression analysis showed significant linear relationships between esr <dig> and three of the candidates: tfrc, hprt <dig> and abl. approximately two thirds of breast tumours are oestrogen-dependent and the number of genes whose expression is known to be, or likely to be mediated through the receptor is sizeable  <cit> . this makes analysis of associations between oestrogen-responsive target and control genes of particular importance in breast cancer studies. although there is little evidence that these genes are regulated by oestrogen, the results suggest that aside from their poor stability it would be wise not to use them as ecs in the analysis of oestrogen-responsive breast cancer.

despite the clear increase in accuracy afforded by the use of more than one validated ec gene, a recent survey of working practices indicated that over half of those polled continue to use one reference gene and that two thirds of these do not validate that gene  <cit> . obviously levels of awareness and/or willingness to address this issue must be improved.

CONCLUSIONS
the current emphasis on personalised cancer treatment has resulted in the development of prognostic and predictive multi-gene rq-pcr assays. however, with such developments comes the demand for greater accuracy and resolution of gene expression quantitation. in this study we have validated two genes, mrpl <dig> and ppia as ec candidates for rq-pcr analysis of primary breast tissue using two different statistical models and demonstrate that of the genes in current use in this field, the above gene combination offers increased accuracy and resolution in the relative quantitation of gene expression data. the genes identified should be of use in a broad spectrum of translational research and diagnostic applications in breast cancer.
