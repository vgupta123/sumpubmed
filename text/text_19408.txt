BACKGROUND
some groups of protein families are known to bind atp, for example kinases and abc transporters. both protein families possess a conserved atp-binding domain called p-loop xgkt;  <cit> . however, atp-binding which is not based on a specific atp-binding domain, is described for many other proteins like lactoferrin  <cit> , bovine serum albumin  <cit>  or gelsolin  <cit> . recently, the interaction of atp with growth factors was discovered  <cit> . the physiological role of this atp-binding to growth factors remained unclear. however, binding of atp to ngf and fgf <dig> seems to be essential for their neuroprotectivity as demonstrated with hippocampal neuronal cells  <cit> . the heparin binding domain  of both growth factors is important for atp-binding  <cit>  although crystallographic data of the growth factor/atp-complexes are not yet available.

complex formation of atp with ngf and fgf <dig> is probably based on ionic interaction of the negatively charged phosphate residues of atp with positively charged arginine and lysine residues located in the hbd of ngf and fgf <dig>  respectively. this is similar to the interaction of sulphate residues of heparin or heparan sulphate-proteoglycans  with heparin-binding growth factors like fibroblast growth factors, vegf, ngf or pdgf  <cit> . additionally, binding of atp to fgf <dig> stabilizes the growth factor and protects it from thermal degradation and proteolytic cleavage with trypsin, neutrophil elastase  or plasmin  <cit> .

in this paper we determined the dissociation constant  of atp-binding to fgf <dig> and analyzed the impact on the conformation of the protein. furthermore, we investigated the consequence of this nucleotide binding on fgf <dig> stability in aqueous solution to get a more detailed insight into this probably important protein-ligand interaction.

methods
equilibrium-microdialysis
rapid equilibrium dialysis inserts  were used along with teflon base plate  for equilibrium dialysis experiments. these inserts contain two 750-μl chambers separated by  <dig>  da molecular mass cut-off. one chamber was filled with fgf <dig>  in  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph  <dig>  , and the other with various concentrations of atp in  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph  <dig> . the dialysis inserts were rotated at room temperature with a speed of  <dig> rpm and equilibrium was reached within  <dig> h as monitored by counting an aliquot from both sides of the membrane at different time points during dialysis. after  <dig> h,  <dig> μl aliquots of the dialysis chambers were removed and kept on ice. atp was determined immediately. the experiments were performed in triplicate.

cd measurement
far-uv spectra  were recorded at fgf <dig> concentration of  <dig> μm with a jasco-j <dig> spectropolarimeter at room temperature in a  <dig> -cm cell with  <dig> accumulations. measurements were performed in  <dig> mm tris-hcl , and all spectra were corrected for buffer and nucleotide background. the results are expressed as ellipticities related to the mean residue weight of amino acids as described before  <cit> .

chemical cross-linking experiments
for cross-linking studies, fgf <dig>  in tris-hcl  was incubated with or without nucleotides , heparin , and/or protamine  at 37°c for  <dig> min.  <dig> mm bissuberate  was added and the reactions were incubated for additional  <dig> h at 20°c. reactions were stopped by adding sds-loading dye and subsequent heating at 95°c for  <dig> min. proteins were separated by sds-page and visualized by silver staining.

degradation of fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> by ne
degradation of fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> by ne was performed as described previously  <cit> . fgf <dig>  and fgf <dig>  were expressed and purified as described previously  <cit> .

elisa
fgf2-elisa was performed according to the supplier's instructions . in brief,  <dig> μl of each sample containing fgf <dig> were added to a 96-well plate, coated with antibody specific for human fgf <dig>  and incubated at 4°c over night. wells were washed  <dig> times and then incubated with biotinylated anti-human fgf <dig> antibody for  <dig> h at rt. after additional washing  streptavidin solution was added to each well and incubated for  <dig> min. after washing   <dig> ', <dig> '-tetramethylbenzidine-solution was added to the wells and incubated for  <dig> min, the reactions were stopped and the absorbance was read at  <dig> nm immediately.

measurement of atp content
atp concentration was determined luminometrically as described previously  <cit> .

RESULTS
dissociation constant of atp-binding to fgf2
previous work has shown that atp can bind to fgf <dig>  <cit> . to characterize this binding of atp to fgf <dig> in more detail, we used equilibrium microdialysis to directly examine the atp-binding properties of the growth factor. equilibrium microdialysis was performed with  <dig> μm fgf <dig> in the reaction chamber. as atp concentrations increased from  <dig> to  <dig> μm, the amount of atp bound to fgf <dig> increased as well reaching a maximum level and indicating a saturation binding behavior . consistent with the radiolabeling experiments  <cit>  and maldi-tof data  <cit> , fgf <dig>  clearly bound atp at concentrations between  <dig> and  <dig> μm. atp binding data were replotted in a scatchard plot and the binding constant was calculated. the linear scatchard plot gave a value of  <dig>  for the number of independent binding sites, indicating that one molecule atp binds to one molecule fgf <dig> . the calculated dissociation constant  is  <dig>  μm.

conformational change of secondary structure of fgf <dig> after atp-binding
we collected cd spectra of untreated fgf <dig> only and fgf <dig> preincubated with nucleotides to investigate putative conformational changes of the secondary structure of the fgf2/ligand-complex. the cd-spectrum of fgf <dig>  showed a curve progression characteristic for a protein rich in β-structure . the signal decreased from  <dig> nm onward reaching a broad minimum around  <dig> nm to increase again to the base level, as it has been reported previously for ngf  <cit> . in contrast to untreated fgf <dig>  fgf <dig> incubated with atp  showed a clear decrease of the amplitude of the broad minimum  and no increase afterwards to the base level at  <dig> nm. this indicates a decrease of percentage of β-structure and finally a conformational change of fgf <dig> after interaction with this nucleotide. in contrast, the cd-spectrum of fgf <dig> did not significantly change after addition of amp . after addition of adp  the cd-spectrum changed only moderately compared to untreated fgf <dig> 

influence of atp on dimerization behaviour of fgf2
previous studies reported dimerization of fgf <dig> and additional receptor binding induced by heparin  <cit> . thus, we were highly interested in finding out whether atp binding or subsequent structural changes could also promote fgf <dig> dimerization. addition of  <dig> mm atp and bs <dig>  did not induce dimerization whereas addition of heparin and bs <dig> did . however, co-incubation of fgf <dig> with heparin , atp  and bs <dig>  did promote formation of dimers with a similar dimer/monomer ratio as observed for incubation with heparin and subsequently bs3-crosslinking only .

stability of fgf <dig> and fgf <dig>  against proteolytic digestion
recently, we reported that a variant form of fgf <dig>  with mutations in the heparin binding domain did not show enhanced stability against trypsin degradation after incubation with atp because of its reduced atp-binding capacity. here, we investigated the stability of mutant fgf <dig> against degradation by neutrophil elastase . the k134a variant showed a partial stability against degradation by ne independent of this protein being preincubated with atp or not . addition of atp did not additionally protect fgf <dig> from protease digestion as revealed by silver staining. interestingly, the atp-binding capacity of fgf <dig> was only moderately reduced compared to the wild-type  <cit> .

stability of fgf <dig> in aqueous solution is increased after atp-binding
atp-binding to fgf <dig> increased the stability of this growth factor against proteolytic degradation as described previously  <cit> . here, we wanted to investigate whether atp protects the growth factor also from physical inactivation, meaning the stability in aqueous solution. therefore, we performed stability experiments of fgf <dig> in tris-buffered aqueous solution at 37°c and subsequently determined fgf2-concentration by elisa. we incubated untreated fgf <dig>  preincubated with atp  or preincubated with heparin  at 37°c for  <dig> h. figure  <dig> shows that the concentration of unprotected fgf <dig> decreased drastically already after  <dig> minutes of incubation from  <dig> ng/ml to about  <dig>  ng/ml, whereas the concentration of fgf <dig>  preincubated with heparin, only marginally decreased over the period of  <dig> h from about  <dig> ng/ml to about  <dig> ng/ml. the stability of fgf <dig>  preincubated with atp, decreased from about  <dig> ng/ml to about  <dig> ng/ml after  <dig> min and to about  <dig> ng/ml after  <dig> min.

additionally, we measured the atp concentration luminometrically at different points of time in the experiment with fgf <dig> preincubated with atp. the atp-concentration did not change significantly indicating that atp was stable over the observed period of two hours .

stability of fgf <dig> depends on number of phosphate residues of used stabilizers
in order to investigate the importance of the number and the position of phosphate residues of putative fgf2-stabilizers, we protected fgf <dig> from trypsin degradation using substances with a different number of phosphate residues in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig> . fgf <dig> was preincubated with each substance to form fgf2/ligand complexes. then, trypsin was added and the samples were incubated for  <dig> h. it was generally observed that with an increasing number of phosphate residues the protective effect on fgf <dig> against tryptic degradation increased respectively . inositol hexaphosphate  revealed a strong protection of the growth factor from tryptic digestion, whereas atp and tripolyphosphate  showed a slightly decreased protective effect. pyrophosphate  only had a marginal protective effect on fgf <dig> degradation under these experimental conditions.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
besides the large groups of atp-binding proteins, for example the kinases and the atpases with more or less defined atp-binding domains , some other atp-binding proteins are described in the literature, e.g. abc transporters, metallothionein, chaperons and actins which lack such a domain  <cit> . growth factors have been identified as atp-binding proteins only recently  <cit> . nerve growth factor , brain-derived growth factor , vascular endothelial growth factor  and fgf <dig> are associated with atp which is very likely to be important for their biological activity.

in this work, the binding affinity of atp to fgf <dig> was determined by equilibrium microdialysis. the kd value of  <dig>  μm showed only moderate binding of atp to fgf <dig> which is contradictory to the binding affinities described for most kinases/atp- and atpases/atp-complexes. this moderate binding constant is well observed to be not consistent with the atp-concentration in the low nmolar range necessary for neuroprotective activity of fgf <dig> in cell culture experiments demonstrated recently  <cit> . based on the experiments described in this paper, a high affine binding domain of atp besides the  <dig>  μmolar binding domain is very likely to be present. however, the kd values of other atp-binding proteins, e.g. gelsolin , p-glycoprotein  and metallothionein , were in a similar range like fgf <dig>  the value of  <dig>  for the number of independent atp-binding sites of fgf <dig> showed that one molecule of fgf <dig> binds one molecule of atp. this is in line with maldi-tof experiments where binding of one molecule of atp to one molecule of fgf <dig> was demonstrated  <cit> . only in the presence of magnesium two molecules of atp were able to bind to fgf <dig>  comparing the kd value of fgf2/atp  with fgf2/hspgs  demonstrated that the binding of hspgs to fgf <dig> was preferred.

although the dissociation constant of atp-binding to fgf <dig> was rather high, this binding leads to a significant change in the secondary structure of fgf <dig> as demonstrated by cd-spectroscopy . thereby the amplitude of structural change depends on the number of phosphate residues of the nucleotides . interestingly, the conformational change after atp-binding to fgf <dig> was more distinct than that of heparin  <cit>  and may explain the physiological importance for neuroprotective activity of fgf <dig>  <cit> .

it has been known for many years that binding of heparin or hspgs to fgf <dig> forces the dimerization of the growth factor and that this is important for interaction with its specific receptors . in contrast to heparin, atp did not lead to a dimerization of fgf <dig> as observed in cross-linking experiments . it could be speculated that atp is not involved in receptor activation by dimerization. more important seems to be the protective effect of this abundantly present nucleotide on fgf <dig>  this is in line with recent data showing that the main role of heparin or hspgs in fgf1-induced signaling is to protect this naturally unstable protein from heat and proteolytic degradation  <cit> .

the atp binding capacity of the mutant fgf <dig>  is reduced by about 20% compared to wt-fgf <dig>  <cit> . adding atp to fgf <dig>  did not show additional protective effects against degradation by ne . furthermore, mutant fgf <dig>  did not show neuroprotective activity  <cit> . it could be speculated that the not observed protectivity of atp on fgf <dig>  is important for the loss of neuroprotectivity of this variant form of the growth factor  <cit> .

besides the protection of fgf <dig> by bound atp from proteolytic digestion  <cit> , we demonstrated in this work that atp additionally protects fgf <dig> from physical degradation. it is known that fgf <dig> is rapidly degraded when incubated in aqueous solution without stabilizers  <cit> . this is the main problem in the use of this important growth factor for medical applications. observing the stability of fgf <dig> in buffered aqueous solution over a period of  <dig> hours clearly showed a protective effect of atp bound to fgf <dig> . however, this protective effect was not as strong as observed with heparin; heparin protected fgf <dig> nearly completely from physical degradation . this decreased effect on the stability of fgf <dig> by atp compared to heparin might be explained by the higher dissociation constant of atp  in contrast to heparin .

the cd-data clearly demonstrate that the number of phosphate residues of the nucleotide  is very important for the conformational change of the growth factor. therefore we investigated the effect of fgf2-stabilization by different ligands exhibiting phosphate residues in the range of 2- <dig> . the results show that the number of negatively charged groups is important for the protective effect against proteolysis. however, thereby it was not taken into account that each substance has a different structure with different distances between the phosphate residues.

taken together our results indicate that the binding affinity of atp to fgf <dig> is moderate, but has a high impact on the secondary structure of the protein. this change in secondary structure might be the reason for the observed effect of atp on the fgf2-stability, which could be classified between non-protected-fgf <dig> and a full-protection by fgf2/heparin-complex. interestingly, the protective effect of atp  on fgf <dig> could also be detected after addition of  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig> leading to the formation of the physiologically important atp/mg2+-complex . such a atp/mg2+-complex  is the predominant form of extracellular atp in tissue.

taken together, a putative physiological role of fgf2-protection by atp in cell culture and tissue is well conceivable and has to be proved in future studies.
