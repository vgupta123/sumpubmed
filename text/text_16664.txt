BACKGROUND
hematopoietic stem cells , with their unique self-renewal and differentiation capacity, offer great potential for the treatment of hematological disorders, immunodeficiency and inborn errors of metabolism  <cit> . hscs can be collected from mobilized peripheral blood , bone marrow  and cord blood . lately, cb has been increasingly utilized because it is readily available, hla mismatches are better tolerated and there is a decreased risk of graft-versus-host disease when using cb-derived hscs when compared to the other sources  <cit> . even though the cell content of cb is limited, it has a higher frequency of progenitor cells compared to pb or bm  <cit> . cb-derived cd34+ cells have also been shown to proliferate more rapidly than their counterparts from bm  <cit> , and cb-derived hscs possess increased engraftment potential when compared to cells from pb or bm  <cit> . in addition, recent studies suggest that cb is a source of non-hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells, such as mesenchymal and endothelial precursors  <cit> .

enrichment of hscs is based on the expression of certain surface antigens or on the lack of expression of lineage-specific antigens. the most commonly used surface marker for hsc selection is the transmembrane glycoprotein cd <dig>  cd <dig> is also used to quantify the stem cell content of cb units banked for clinical use  <cit> . most, if not all, cd34+ cells express the cd <dig> glycoprotein on their surface. cd <dig> appears to be expressed on more primitive cells and cd133+ cell grafts have been tested in stem cell transplantation  <cit> . alternative, but currently poorly characterized lin- progenitor cells lack lineage-specific markers  <cit> . fluorescence-activated cell sorting and immunomagnetic selection systems utilize antibodies against these cell surface antigens to enrich hscs. however, the major challenge has been the difficulty to produce highly pure hsc fractions from cb with good recovery. furthermore, the handling of cb is challenging due to the relatively high content of thrombocytes and nucleated erythroid precursors which have a negative impact on the mononuclear cell isolation. for these reasons, standardized protocols for pb sample handling and cell separation do not work well for cb. only few studies have investigated the efficiency of the immunomagnetic selection method used to isolate cd34+ cells from cb. belvedere et al. compared the results from  <dig> selections and reported mean cd34+ cell purities of 41% and 85% after first and second passage through the separation column, respectively  <cit> . melnik et al. report an average purity of 60% for cb-derived cd34+ cells from  <dig> separations  <cit> .

in this study, three different protocols were optimized to enrich cd34+, cd133+ and lin- hscs with over 90% purity from both fresh and cryopreserved cb. cryopreserved cb cells have been considered to be especially challenging in selection procedures because of cell aggregation caused by cell damage during thawing. the used protocols were based on positive selection of cells expressing cd <dig> and cd <dig>  or on depletion of cells expressing lineage-specific markers. the magnetic cell sorting system macs was used due to its gentleness and time-effectiveness. further, the clonogenic capacity of selected hsc populations was determined using the colony-forming unit  assay.

RESULTS
handling of cb cells
the isolation of pure mononuclear cell  fractions from cb, and subpopulations thereof, brings about a special challenge. this appears to be due to the large number of thrombocytes and erythroid progenitors in cb. in the ficoll-paque density gradient, all erythroid cells do not necessarily sediment to the bottom layer, but are retained in the interphase of plasma and ficoll-paque. the erythroid cells remaining in the interphase are nucleated progenitors that may hamper the subsequent immunomagnetic selection of hsc populations. treatment with ammonium chloride or diethylene glycol may be used to deplete red blood cells, but depletion was not performed in this study as the nucleated erythroid progenitors are not easily lyzed and purities up to 97% were reached without any additional treatment. the unusually slow sedimentation of erythroid cells is not seen when working with pb.

when handling cryopreserved cb cells, aggregation was observed. aggregation was reduced by replacing ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid  with anticoagulant citrate dextrose solution, formula a  in the sample buffer. in some cases aggregation was so substantial that the cells needed to be resuspended in dnasei containing buffer. dnasei digests the dna released from dead cells and prevents aggregation. the dnase treatment did not affect the viability or colony-forming potential of selected cb cells. no cell aggregation was seen when handling fresh cb cells.

mnc fraction
in cryopreserved cb, the mean mnc concentration was  <dig>  × 109/l  , and the mean platelet concentration was  <dig>  × 109/l . cryopreserved cb contained a mean of  <dig>  × 1012/l erythrocytes , and the mean hematocrit was 2%.

fresh cb contained a mean of  <dig>  × 109/l mncs  . the difference in mnc concentration between cryopreserved and fresh samples was not statistically significant . the remarkably high disparity in the standard deviation of mnc concentration between cryopreserved and fresh cb may be due to the processing and freezing of cells performed to bank the cb units  <cit> . the mean concentration was  <dig>  × 109/l  for platelets and  <dig>  × 1012/l  for erythrocytes. the mean hematocrit was 1%.

immunomagnetic separation of hsc populations
when using the direct cd <dig> progenitor cell isolation kit with single column separation and the labeling protocol recommended by the manufacturer , a purity of less than 50% was reached for the cd34+ cells . to obtain highly pure cd34+ cells, the immunomagnetic selection method was optimized. several washing steps  were tested for single column separation. a purity of 80% was achieved with extensive washing, but the yield was poor . two successive column separations resulted in 77% purity, but a great number of cd34+ cells were still lost during the process indicating a further need to optimize the protocol. an additional labeling step between the two column separations increased the purity to >90%  and resulted in an acceptable yield as well. the optimized two-column method with additional labeling proved reliable and was applied to the separation of both cd34+ and cd133+ cells. the average yield of cd34+ and cd133+ cells from one cord blood unit was  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the purity of positively selected cd34+/cd133+ cells was reproducibly over 90% and their negative counterparts were nearly 100% pure.

generally, the recovery of cd34+ and cd133+ cells was  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively. the recovery of cd34+ cells was higher from fresh cb  when compared to cryopreserved cb , although the difference was not statistically significant . the results are consistent with the study by almici et al. showing no significant difference in yield or in purity for fresh cb cd34+ cells in comparison to crypreserved cells  <cit> . this was the case with cd133+ cells as well, the recovery being  <dig> % for fresh cb and  <dig> % for cryopreserved cb . the purities were not affected by the initial percentage of hsc populations in cb. the results of the purity assessment for representative samples of cd34+/-, cd133+/- and lin-/+ cells are shown in figure  <dig> 

the magnetic sorting of lin- cells was optimized to find the optimum concentrations for antibodies and magnetic colloids. lin- cells were separated from the mnc fraction with magnetic cell sorting and the purity of the enriched cell fraction was analyzed by flow cytometry. the average yield of lin- cells from one cord blood unit was  <dig>  the overall recovery of lin- cells was  <dig> % , being higher in fresh cb samples  than in cryopreserved cb samples . the difference between fresh and cryopreserved samples was not statistically significant . the mean purity of lin- cell population was 90%  and it did not differ between fresh and cryopreserved cb units. to assess the effect of antibody concentration on the selection of lin- cells, varying amounts of the antibody cocktail  and magnetic colloids  were tested. the concentration of antibodies and magnetic colloids did not affect the purity of lin- cells based on flow cytometric analysis.

all the optimized protocols are described in detail in figure  <dig>  the operation time for the selection of cd34+/- and cd133+/- cells using minimacs or midimacs is approximately  <dig>  hours. the operation time for isolation of lin-/+ cells is approximately  <dig> minutes. the selection can be made more effective with the automacs system developed for high-speed automated cell sorting. the optimized protocols have been developed for enrichment of cb hscs for research purposes. however, the enrichment of stem and progenitor cells is often necessary in clinical settings. the selected hscs are increasingly used in transplantations and enrichment may be required for depletion of contaminating mature cells or tumor cells. potentially, the methods described here could be applied to clinical-grade selection using the clinimacs system that is ce-marked for clinical use in europe.

with the optimized protocols, a purity of at least 90% was achieved for cd34+, cd133+ and lin- cells. viability was 99% for all the selected cell types. this demonstrates that the optimized protocols work well for hsc enrichment from both fresh and cryopreserved cb. fresh cb was easier to handle and the recovery of hscs was higher from fresh cb. nonetheless, cryopreserved cord blood is almost exclusively used in clinical settings. therefore, if one wishes to use selected hscs, the cells should preferably be isolated on fresh cord blood and cryopreserved after the selection procedure to maximize the recovery of hscs. hscs, enriched by the protocols described here, have been used in gene expression studies with great reproducibility and consistency  <cit> .

it has been suggested that the binding of an antibody to the surface of a hsc may influence cell proliferation and differentiation by activating intracellular signaling pathways  <cit> . an anti-cd <dig> antibody has been shown to induce tyrosine phosphorylation in bm-derived cd34+ cells  <cit> . however, lin- cells are selected through negative depletion. thus, neither antibody binding nor activation of signaling pathways is expected. further studies on the effect of the interaction between hscs and the antibodies used for their selection as well as the possible impact of this contact on hsc quality are awaited.

low number of hscs in cord blood is a limitation for its use. ex vivo expansion of hscs may be used to generate the clinically relevant cell numbers needed for adult patients. however, mature cells may develop during long-term culture and result in a need for reselection of progenitor cells. the optimized protocols can be applied for enrichment of stem and progenitor cells after ex vivo expansion.

colony forming unit assay
the cfu assay was used to measure the clonogenic capacity of cd34+, cd133+ and lin- cells as well as mncs. total cfu  number was determined as the sum of granulocyte-erythroid-macrophage-megakaryocyte , granulocyte-macrophage , erythroid  and burst-forming erythroid  colonies. cfu-tot counts were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  per  <dig> cells for cd34+, cd133+, lin- and mncs, respectively. cd34- and cd133- cell populations have shown very limited colony forming potential in our previous studies with cfu-tot counts of  <dig>  and  <dig>  per  <dig> cells, respectively.

cfu-gm colonies  and cfu-gemm colonies  were the most common colony types formed by of cb-derived hscs. the proportion of different colony types for cd34+, cd133+, lin- and mncs is shown in table  <dig>  bfu-es represented a mean of  <dig> % of the colony content of hscs. however, the lin- cell fraction formed a surprisingly large number of bfu-es , probably due to the inefficient removal of erythroid progenitors during the depletion procedure. very little cfu-e colonies were observed , mnc population being the most efficient in forming them . the high proportion of bfu-e and cfu-e colonies formed by the mnc population reflects the unusual sedimentation of erythroid progenitors in ficoll-paque density gradient. the results show that all the selected hsc populations have substantial clonogenic potential and are highly non-committed. taken together, the data support the use of traditionally used markers to separate hsc populations until more specific markers are found.

CONCLUSIONS
immunomagnetic cell sorting enables fast and gentle separation of hscs. however, the previously reported protocols are not optimal for cb and result in unsatisfactory purity and yield, indicating a need for optimization of the procedures. with the modified protocols presented here, over 90% pure hsc fractions can be reproducibly obtained. this is essential for the use of specific hematopoietic progenitor cell types in research and therapeutic applications.

the single most important factor influencing engraftment in hsc transplantation appears to be the nucleated cell content. even though the cell content is limited in cb and there is no possibility to obtain an additional graft from the same donor, the increased engraftment potential of cb-derived hscs makes them an appealing alternative for hscs from pb or bm. it remains to be seen whether the total nucleated cell content or a population of highly pure and specific hematopoietic progenitor cells will prove to be more important for graft potency.
