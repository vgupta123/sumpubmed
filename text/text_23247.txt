BACKGROUND
many plant disease resistance  genes from different plant species have been isolated and characterized; but are grouped into a limited number of classes  <cit> . r loci are usually organized in clusters, and genes within one cluster are mostly derived from a common ancestor  <cit> . the clustering feature can facilitate the expansion of r gene number and the generation of new r gene specificities through recombination and positive selection  <cit> . long contiguous sequences containing several r genes or resistance gene analogues  have been determined  <cit> . these sequences provided insights into the mechanisms of r gene evolution and generation of novel recognition specificity. insertions of retroelements in genomic regions containing r genes or rgas have been documented in these studies. retroelements are suggested to create variability among paralogous r gene members  <cit> .

soybean  is a legume crop of great economic and agricultural importance across the world. its estimated genome size is  <dig>  mb, of which approximately 40–60% is composed of repetitive sequence  <cit> . repetitive dna sequences have been shown to be the major determinant of plant genome sizes  <cit> . there are two main types of repetitive sequences, tandem repeat dna sequences and dispersed dna sequences such as retroelements  <cit> . several tandem repeats, sb <dig>  str <dig> and strr <dig> have been reported in soybean  <cit> . it has been suggested that soybean has experienced at least two rounds of genome-wide duplications  <cit> . despite the availability of genomics resources such as densely saturated genetic maps, bac and yac libraries, large est collections, bac end sequences, a soybean genome database  browser, and the legume information system   <cit> , our knowledge of soybean genome structure is still largely limited  <cit> .

root and stem rot disease caused by pytophthora sojae is one of the most destructive soybean diseases in the united states  <cit> . use of phytophthora resistance conferred by single dominant rps genes has been providing reasonable protection of soybean against this pathogen. five rps genes including rps1-k were mapped to the rps <dig> locus located near the  <dig> cm map position on molecular linkage group n of the composite genetic soybean map  <cit> . among these five genes, rps1-k was introgressed from the cultivar, kingwa. rps1-k confers resistance to most races of p. sojae, and has been widely used for the past two decades  <cit> . by applying a positional cloning approach two classes of functional coiled coil-nucleotide binding-leucine rich repeat -type resistance genes were isolated from the soybean rps1-k locus  <cit> . a large cluster of highly polymorphic paralogous rps1-k sequences is located at the adjacent rps1-k region  <cit> . the rps1-k locus was mapped to two overlapping bac clones encompassing  <dig> kb, located at one end of an approximately  <dig> kb contiguous dna spanned by several overlapping bac clones  <cit> . cc-nb-lrr-type genes of the  <dig> kb rps1-k region were evaluated and two classes of highly similar genes were shown to confer race-specific phytophthora resistance  <cit> . to gain insights into the soybean genome organization and evolution of rsp1-k genes, bac clones encompassing the rps <dig> locus were sequenced and analyzed.

RESULTS
sequence of three bac clones spanning the rps1-k locus
rps1-k was previously mapped to a region flanked by two markers cg <dig> and 18r  <cit> . to understand the composition of the rps1-k region, three overlapping bac clones, gs_18j <dig>  gs_43d <dig> and gs_99i <dig> that may encompass the rps <dig> locus were chosen for sequencing  <cit> . phytophthora resistance genes were previously identified from these three bac clones through positional cloning  <cit> .

a total of  <dig>  reads  were generated from these bac clones. gs_18j <dig>  gs_43d <dig> and gs_99i <dig> were sequenced to a 14-, 12- and 9-fold redundancies, respectively. a single contig of  <dig>  bp was obtained for gs_18j <dig> after the initial assembly . three and five contigs were obtained from assembling of sequences derived from gs_43d <dig> and gs_99i <dig>  respectively. the resulting contigs of gs_43d <dig> and gs_99i <dig> were ordered into individual scaffolds manually, in which the order and orientation of the contigs were inferred by mate pairs   <cit> . the clones that span the gaps between two adjacent contigs were identified based on mate pairs and were used to obtain sequences of the gap regions. gaps were filled out by applying the primer walking approach. primers were designed based on the sequences of contig ends from which walking were initiated. to guarantee the high sequence quality, less sequenced regions were further sequenced by using suitable primers. after initial assembly and gap filling,  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp sequences were obtained from gs_43d <dig> and gs_99i <dig>  respectively . the assembled gs_18j <dig> sequences represent one end of the gs_43d <dig> 

directional sequencing of gs_43d16
earlier, partial sequencing of the three bac clones had allowed us to identify candidate genes underlying rps1-k. the functional identities of rps1-k genes were confirmed through stable transformation in soybean  <cit> . two classes of rps1-k genes were identified. the three class i rps1-k genes were identical in their orf sequences. the class i gene, rps1-k- <dig>  showed a recombination breakpoint at the 3' untranslated region originating from sequence exchange between members of both classes of genes  <cit> .

rps1-k- <dig>  rps1-k- <dig> and rps1-k- <dig> were isolated from gs_43d <dig>  <cit> . the existence of abundant repetitive sequences made it difficult to assemble the sequences of the bac clones. to avoid any misassembly, gs_43d <dig> containing rps1-k- <dig>  rps1-k- <dig> and rps1-k- <dig> was subjected to directional sequencing using the ez::tn <noti/kan-3> transposon of the ez::tn in-frame linker insertion kit . two hundred and twenty-four ez::tn <noti/kan-3> transposon insertion gs_43d <dig> clones were randomly selected for further analysis. this approach allowed us to map physically the individual sequence reads onto the gs_43d <dig> sequence as follows. transposon insertion sites of individual transposition events were utilized to select ez::tn <noti/kan-3> transposon containing gs_43d <dig> clones. each clone was digested with noti and hybridized to gs_43d <dig> end-specific probes in southern analyses . there are three noti sites in gs_43d16; one in the insert soybean genomic dna and two in the pbelobac <dig> vector flanking the cloning hindiii site. therefore, noti digestion of gs_43d <dig> resulted in three noti fragments ;  a large dna fragment of ~ <dig> kb,  a small dna fragment of ~ <dig> kb, and  the pbelobac <dig> vector sequence. there are two noti sites flanking the kanamycin resistance gene in the ez::tn <noti/kan-3> transposon. therefore, if there is a single transposon insertion in the gs_43d <dig> clone, then five fragments including the ~ <dig>  kb transposon, should be generated following noti digestion .

of the analyzed  <dig> random transposon-inserted gs_43d <dig> clones,  <dig> were shown to contain the transposon in the large fragment;  <dig> of them in the small fragment; and  <dig> in the pbelobac <dig> vector. clones containing transposon insertions in the vector pbelobac <dig> were not considered for further study. approximate physical locations of transposon insertions in individual noti genomic dna fragments were determined by southern analyses as shown in figure  <dig>  based on the physical location of transposon insertions,  <dig> gs_43d <dig> clones containing transposon insertions in either the  <dig> or  <dig> kb noti fragment were selected for sequencing by using transposon end-specific primers. only about 50% percent of the clones produced sequences that were readable. pairwise sequence comparison between the assembled gs_43d <dig> sequence and sequences obtained from individual transposon inserted gs_43d <dig> clones revealed the transposon insertion sites in gs_43d <dig> 

among the randomly picked  <dig> transposon-inserted clones, the number of transposon insertions was proportional to the size of noti fragments. however, there were no insertions in two regions, one of about  <dig> kb in the ~ <dig> kb fragment and the other one is about  <dig> kb in the ~ <dig> kb fragment. whether this was due to bias in transposon insertion or due to sampling variance is yet to be determined.

the quality of  <dig>  bp assembled gs_43d <dig> sequence was verified through restriction mapping as follows. clones carrying transposon insertions at various regions were selected and double digested with kpni and noti. the predicted kpni – noti restriction maps based on the assembled gs_43d <dig> sequence is shown in figure 2a. eight fragments are expected from kpn <dig> and noti double digestion of gs_43d <dig>  only five fragments were resolved in the gel analyses, because some of the fragments are of similar sizes. for example, there are two  <dig> kb fragments termed fragment i. following digestion of clones carrying single transposons with both enzymes released two additional fragments and the  <dig>  kb transposon. depending upon the position of the transposon in a given kpni or kpni-noti fragment two fragments of variable sizes were produced . comparison of observed fragment sizes with that of expected fragment sizes showed that there is general agreement between the observed and expected fragment sizes. sali-noti map  based on the assembled sequence was also verified by digesting gs_43d <dig> with sali and noti. eight fragments were expected from the double digestion. two fragments,  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb were not resolved and termed fragment iv . smallest fragment  is not shown in fig 2d. taking these data together, it was concluded that the generated gs_43d <dig> sequence represents the physical distance of the soybean dna present in that clone and no large fragments were remained to be sequenced.

genes underlying the rps1-k
gs_18j <dig> overlaps with one end of gs_43d <dig>  gs_99i <dig> comprised  <dig>  bp sequences of gs_43d <dig> . there were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % identities between the overlapping sequences of gs_18j <dig> and gs_43d <dig>  gs_43d <dig> and gs_99i <dig>  and gs_18j <dig> and gs_99i <dig>  respectively. these results indicate high quality of the assembled sequences. high identity of gs_43d <dig> sequence with the overlapping regions of gs_18j <dig> and gs_99i <dig> suggested that there was no rearrangement in gs_43d <dig>  from which rps1-k- <dig>  rps1-k- <dig> and rps1-k- <dig> were previously isolated  <cit> .

the gene content of an  <dig>  bp contig sequence  carrying the rps1-k locus derived from the gs_43d <dig> and gs_99i <dig> sequences was determined. genes were predicted with genescan and genemark.hmm es- <dig>  programs  <cit> . to get a better gene prediction, genes predicted by genescan and genemark.hmm, and/or sequences having similarities to soybean ests were further analyzed by different ncbi blast programs and sequence alignment programs. putative annotations of the predicted genes were accomplished by blastp searches. the gene content in the rsp1-k region appears to be poor. only a few full-length genes were predicted. these include two coiled coil-nucleotide binding-leucine rich repeat -type rps1-k genes and retrotransposons .

1genes not having matched soybean ests were not included.

 <dig> indicates the coding sequence is on the forward sequence, while – indicates the coding sequence is on the reverse sequence.

most of the identified genes are truncated. genes were considered truncated when their predicted reading frames are partial. for example, the predicted cysteine proteinase shares an 88% identity with the first  <dig> amino acids of a soybean cysteine proteinase protein  followed by a premature stop codon. blastn search against the soybean est database was performed to support our gene prediction. ests showing high similarities but no complete identities to all predicted genes were identified .

the rps1-k region is composed of repetitive sequences
the major portion of the contiguous  <dig>  bp sequence of the rps1-k region is comprised of repetitive sequences including simple repeat sequences, tandem repeats and retroelements. the simple repeat and tandem repeat sequences were identified using sputnik and tandem repeats finder. sixteen simple repeat sequences were identified . sixty-three tandem repeats were revealed with copy numbers ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> and unit length varying from  <dig> to  <dig> bp . the consensus motif length of the tandem repeat containing  <dig> copies is  <dig> bp. sequence data from individual reads confirmed that they are tandem repeats in head-to-tail orientation. this sequence was used to query the soybean gss  database and a number of sequences with high identities were revealed. the one  showing highest identity to the consensus  <dig> bp tandem sequence came from the project on characterization of the heterochromatic, gene-poor centric regions of soybean chromosomes.

another abundant tandem repeat contains the consensus aatcaag sequence. there are  <dig>  copies of this repeat sequence between positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  and  <dig>  copies between  <dig>  and  <dig> . several soybean tandem repeat sequences, sb <dig>  str <dig> and str <dig>  have been identified  <cit> . seven copies of a tandem repeat sequence with  <dig> bp unit length were also found in the rps1-k locus, but it shares no similarity with str <dig> or str <dig> 

the ~ <dig> kb intergenic sequence between rps1-k- <dig> and rps1-k- <dig> is primarily made up of repetitive sequences. four simple repeat sequences were localized in this interval. notably, a  <dig> bp sequence was found at two locations, one between positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  and the other one between positions  <dig>  and  <dig> . this sequence encodes part of a protein sharing high similarity to the receptor-like protein kinase, xa <dig> .

a copia/ty1-like retroelement, sire1– <dig>  was identified from the assembled  <dig>  bp sequence of the rps1-k region  <cit> . the  <dig>  kb sequence encoding the sire1– <dig> element was used to query the soybean est database. two ests  showed 99% identity to part of the gag-pol encoding sequence, one est showed 92% identity to the ltrs and one est exhibited similarities to the envelope-like sequence.

the cc-nb-lrr-type gene, rps1-k- <dig> evolved through intramolecular recombination in escherchia coli
previously it was reported that a cc-nb-lrr gene, rps1-k- <dig> was evolved from recombination between rps1-k- <dig> and rps1-k- <dig>  <cit> . the gene was comprised of 5' end from rps1-k- <dig> and 3'-untranslated region from rps1-k- <dig>  this gene was isolated form gs_43d <dig> but not from either gs_18j <dig> or gs_99i <dig>  this observation suggested that these two bac clones did not overlap  <cit> . therefore, it was concluded that the two class i cc-nb-lrr genes isolated from gs_18j <dig> and gs_99i <dig> were unique.

following sequencing, rps1-k- <dig> was not identified from gs_43d <dig>  physical mapping of gs_43d <dig>  and high identities between overlapping sequences of three independent bac clones  suggested strongly that the complete sequence of gs_43d <dig> was obtained and this clone did not go through any rearrangement. rps1-k- <dig> was identified from a binary clone, p43- <dig> cloned in the ptf <dig>  vector  <cit> . the clone was isolated from a library of binary clones prepared from gs_43d <dig> dna partially digested with bamhi. since this gene was not found in gs_43d <dig>  the gene must have evolved through intramolecular recombination in escherichia coli. comparison of the insert sequence of p43- <dig> with gs_43d <dig> sequence revealed that the insert of the binary clone carries sequences identical to a bamhi fragment that contains an internal bamhi site . however, p43- <dig> insert dna does not contain a segment of the gs_43d <dig> including the internal bamhi site. this gene presumably originated from recombination in e. coli. by looking at the recombinant breakpoint in rps1-k- <dig>  it was hypothesized that two identical  <dig> bp sequences  of the 3'-end of both rps1-k- <dig> and rps1-k- <dig> were involved in the reca-independent recombination process as shown in figure  <dig> 

the major recombination pathway in e. coli requires reca  <cit> . therefore, reca- strains, such as dh10b used in our experiment, are considered for recombinant gene cloning experiments to avoid any recombination events. unfortunately, reca-independent intraplasmid recombination does occur in these reca- strains. the frequency of recombination is however much lower as compared to that observed in reca+ strains  <cit> . a recent study suggested that reca-independent recombination is suppressed by single-strand dna exonuclease  activity. in absence ssexos, the extent of reca-independent recombination in reca- strains is comparable to that in reca+ strains  <cit> .

discussion
genomes of higher plants vary significantly in their size and complexity. repetitive dna sequences have been shown to be the major determinant of genome sizes in higher plants  <cit> . the prevalence of transposable elements and retroelements can promote unequal crossing-over leading to transposon-mediated rearrangements and gene duplications  <cit> . it has been hypothesized that transposable elements play a major role in the expansion and diversification of transmembrane receptor kinase-type disease resistance xa <dig> gene family  <cit> . the abundance of retroelements has been observed in several genomic regions containing r genes or rga loci, such as barley powdery mildew resistance gene, mla, and citrus virus resistance gene, ctv  <cit> . the variability among  <dig> rice xa <dig> gene members has been considered to be generated mainly from the rearrangements mediated by transposon-like elements  <cit> . rps1-k genes are arranged closely. about  <dig> copies of rps1-k-like sequences were predicted to exist in the soybean genome. most of the copies are clustered in the rps1-k region  <cit> . a copia-like retroelement, tgmr, has previously been reported from the rps1-k region  <cit> . it is possible that retrotransposons facilitated the amplification of the rps1-k gene family.

in many plant species such as arabidopsis thaliana and medicago tuncatula, chromosome arms are differentiated into euchromatic and heterochromatic regions  <cit> . recently, lin et al.  <cit>  showed that in soybean heterochromatic regions are also delimited from euchromatin. studies in arabidopsis, medicago and lycopersicon esculentum have shown that the euchromatin has a high gene density, whereas pericentromeric heterochromatin is largely comprised of repetitive sequences  <cit> . the rps1-k region is composed of mostly tandem repeat sequences and retroelements . the gene content is very similar to that of a soybean bac clone identified from the pericentromeric heterochromatin  <cit> . fish mapping showed that sire <dig> and other retroelements are sequestered to the heterochromatic and/or pericentromeric regions  <cit> . the tandem repeat sequences and retroelements including sire <dig> are commonly abundant in heterochromatic and/or pericentromeric regions of the soybean genome. therefore, the rps1-k region could be located in heterochromatic region which may be pericentromeric.

the possible microcollinearities of the rps1-k locus with genomic sequences of plant species such as arabidopsis, medicago and lotus japonicus were investigated. an r protein-like sequence of medicago genomic clone, mth2-138e <dig>  showed 65% identities to rps1-k- <dig>  however, no synteny was observed between the rps1-k region and mth2-138e <dig> sequence. a limited synteny of the rps1-k locus was observed with the lotus genome. two copies of a lotus rps1-k homolog located five kb apart showed 54%–58% identity with the rps1-k- <dig> protein. these two genes are located in two overlapping lotus bac clones, ljt02f <dig> and ljt20j <dig>  apart from the lotus rps1-k homolog, no nucleic acid sequences of these two lotus bac clones showed similarity to sequences of the rps1-k region. in order to identify susceptible haplotype , the rps1-k contig sequence was compared with the available bac end sequences from the soygd database that contains sequences of the cultivar forrest carrying the susceptible rps <dig> gene  <cit> . no sequence from lg n of the forrest haplotype was identified that showed similarity to the rps1-k contig reported here .

it has been reported that plant disease resistance gene loci exhibit extensive loss of synteny. r gene-like sequences frequently lack syntenic map locations between the cereal species rice, barley, and foxtail millet  <cit> . an effort to clone the rice homolog of the barley rpg <dig> gene was unsuccessful; because, although the dna markers flanking rpg <dig> were syntenic between rice and barley, the region containing the gene is absent in the syntenic rice genome  <cit> . these observations imply that r gene loci evolve faster than the rest of the genomes. this is further supported by comparative sequence analysis conducted in crucifers and grasses  <cit> . r genes may be located in less stable regions of the genome such as telomeric or pericentromeric regions where synteny is poorly conserved  <cit> . the tomato tm- <dig> gene resides in a heterochromatic region near the centromere of chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the rpg <dig> gene is located near the telomere of the short arm of barley chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the tomato mi- <dig> gene is located at the border region between euchromatin and heterochromatin  <cit> . the lack of microsynteny of the rps1-k region with the currently available genome sequences and abundance of repeat sequences including retroelements suggested that rps1-k is located in a heterochromatic region which could be pericentromeric.

the rps1-k- <dig> and rps1-k- <dig> genes are about  <dig> kb apart . most frequently r genes are arranged in clusters, and genes within one cluster are mostly derived from a common ancestral gene  <cit> . this clustering feature is considered to facilitate the expansion of r gene numbers and race-specificities through recombination and positive selection  <cit> . study of multiple, genetically linked r gene families has provided insight into the molecular mechanisms of r gene evolution and the generation of novel recognition specificity. seven family members of xa <dig> were identified within a 230-kb region  <cit> . similarly, seven members of the tomato i <dig> gene family reside in a  <dig> kb region  <cit> . the tomato cf- <dig> locus contains two nearly identical resistance genes in a  <dig> kb fragment  <cit> . both tomato cf <dig> and cf <dig> loci comprised of four additional tandemly duplicated paralogous copies within a 36-kb region  <cit> . paralogous r gene sequences have also been reported to map more distantly. for example, members of the lettuce dm <dig> family span at least  <dig>  mb with at least  <dig> kb distance between two gene members  <cit> . although in these examples members are evolved from one progenitor gene  <cit> , three distinct cc-nb-lrr gene families were identified in the mla locus within a 240-kb region  <cit> . the potato r <dig> locus also contains three fast evolving cc-nb-lrr genes that undergo frequent sequence exchanges among members of individual groups  <cit> .

plants have to generate novel resistance specificities to combat the quickly evolved pathogens. this clustering feature can facilitate the expansion of r gene numbers and the generation of new r gene specificities through recombination and positive selection  <cit> . paralogous r gene sequences were most likely evolved through unequal recombination. the maize rp <dig> locus, carrying nine paralogues, is probably the best example of unequal recombination for evolution of tandem paralogous r gene sequences  <cit> . an unequal crossing over between arabidopsis rpp <dig> and its paralog, rpha <dig> most likely resulted in rpp <dig>  <cit> . an unequal crossing over event was detected at the rps1-k region leading to tandem duplication  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
genomes of higher plants vary significantly in their size and complexity because of the existence of a large amount of repetitive sequences. it was observed that the rps1-k region is composed of mostly tandem repeat sequences and retroelements. several disease resistance genes have been found in the less stable regions of the genome such as telomeric or pericentromeric regions where synteny is poorly conserved. the lack of microsynteny of the rps1-k region with the currently available genome sequences and abundance of repeat sequences in the locus suggest that rps1-k is located in a heterochromatic region that could be pericentromeric.
