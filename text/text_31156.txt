BACKGROUND
the reported incidence of primary germ cell tumors  of central nervous system  in children is significantly higher in taiwan, japan and korea compared to western countries. the comparative incidences are  <dig> % in japan,  <dig> % in taiwan,  <dig> % in korea,  <dig> % in usa, and  <dig> % in german in various reported series  <cit> . there is still no explanation for this extreme geographic and ethnic difference between the three asian series and the two western series   <cit> . genomic differences need to be considered and evaluated.

primary cns gct consists of several subtypes with different degrees of histological differentiation and malignancy. according to histological differentiation, related tumor markers, and secreted protein markers, these tumors can be classified into germinomas and nongerminomatous gcts , the latter including embryonal carcinoma , yolk sac tumors , choriocarcinoma , teratoma  and mixed gcts  <cit> . for nggcts, except for benign mature teratoma, all of the other tumors present with diverse malignancies and therapeutic sensitivities when compared to germinomas and are grouped together as nongerminomatous malignant gcts . ngmgcts require more extensive drug and irradiation treatment regimens, have a higher recurrence rate and a lower survival rate  <cit> . clinically, >50% of pediatric cns gcts are germinomas, while the majority of remaining tumors are ngmgcts  <cit> . histologically, germinoma is the most undifferentiated gct and is composed of undifferentiated large cells that resemble primordial germinal elements. among the nggcts, the histological picture differs depending on the diagnosis. ec contains undifferentiated stem cells resembling the embryonic inner cell mass . yst and cc correspond to the extra-embryonic differentiation along mesoblast and trophoblast lines, respectively. this contrasts with teratomas, which consist of differentiated derivatives that include all three germ layers with or without incompletely differentiated tissue elements, like neuroepithelium, which resembles fetal tissue. cns gcts often present with more than one histological component and are then classified as mixed gcts  <cit> .

gcts are presumed to arise from mutated primordial germ cells  of genital ridge origin or dysfunction totipotent embryonic cells  <cit> . investigation of the different genetic compositions in ecs and es cells may provide clues about the reduced dependency on external cues for self-maintenance that exist among gcts, thereby benefiting tumorigenesis research on ecs as well as applications for human es cells . global gene expression studies in human embryonic stem cells and human pluripotent germ cell tumors have shown that the gene expression patterns of human es cell lines are similar to those of the human embryonal carcinoma cell samples but are more distantly related to those of seminoma samples  <cit> . genes that are expressed at significantly greater levels in human es and embryonal carcinoma cell lines than in control samples were pinpointed and are possible candidates for involvement in the maintenance of a pluripotent undifferentiated phenotype  <cit> . wnt and notch pathway genes are overexpressed in the pluripotent human embryonal carcinoma cell line ntera <dig> and in embryonic stem cells  <cit> . these include members of the frizzled gene family , which encodes receptors for the wnt proteins, the frizzled related protein family , which encode soluble wnt antagonists and also ligands and receptors of the notch pathway   <cit> .

the histological differences between the various different gcts are mirrored by their gene expression profiles  <cit> . genomic studies have been conducted on gcts, most notably on caucasian adult gonadal ones  <cit> . however, only limited gene profiling studies have focused on primary pediatric cns gcts, and, to our knowledge, no transcriptome profiling work on asian cases has been reported. a very recently paper studied global mrna expression patterns in pediatric malignant gcts arising from the testis, the ovary, the sacrococcygeal region and the brain, and then compared these with adult testicular tumors. these results showed that there is no segregation of gcts with the same histology at different sites or at different ages, within the pediatric range. however, clear segregation of pediatric and adult tumors, most conspicuously among the ysts, was observed  <cit> . the pediatric seminomas are significantly enriched for genes associated with a self-renewing pluripotent phenotype, whereas the pediatric ysts are significantly enriched for genes associated with differentiation and proliferation  <cit> . these results suggest that the observed clinical differences between pediatric cns gcts from different ethnic backgrounds or prognosis groups may also be detected using genomic analysis.

micrornas  are small rnas of 18- <dig> nucleotides in length that are involved in the regulation of gene expression and hence a variety of biological processes through post-transcriptional rna interference-based mechanisms. matured mirnas interact and inhibit target mrnas and result in translational repression or mrna cleavage  <cit> . in medulloblastoma , an aggressive brain malignancy with a predominant incidence in childhood, a high throughput mirna profiling analysis found that only a few mirnas displayed upregulated expression, while most of them, such as mir- <dig> and mir-125a, were downregulated in the tumor samples, suggesting a tumor growth-inhibitory function  <cit> . moreover, the same group identified mirnas downregulated in human mbs with high hedgehog  signaling, which is one of the pathogenesis mechanisms of mb  <cit> . differential mirnas, such as mir- <dig>  have been identified and found to correlate with prognosis, differentiation, and apoptosis in pediatric neuroblastoma  <cit> . a high-throughput mirnome analysis of adult gonadal gcts has been published, and in each gct subtype the mirna patterns are quite different  <cit> . for gcts in children, only limited mirna data has been reported.

genomic copy number variation  in gcts of adulthood has been extensively investigated. gain of 12p in up to 80% of cases of adult testicular gcts  <cit> . in contrast, comparatively little genomic cnv investigation has been conducted on childhood gcts. using metaphase comparative genomic hybridization , a wide range of cnvs has been described in pediatric gcts, including gains on 1q, 2p,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  20q,  <dig>  and x, as well as losses on 1p <dig>  4q, 6q,  <dig>   <dig> and 18; but none are seen consistently  <cit> . this may due to either the heterogeneity of the gcts, or the different algorithms that were applied to identify the cnv regions. in  <dig>  palmer et al. used  <dig> gcts ,  <dig> germinomatous tumors and one metastatic embryonal carcinoma), which had occurred in children from birth to age  <dig>  for cnv analysis. most of their cases were from the testis, the ovary and the sacrococcygeal region and only two germinomas and one yst brain bct were included  <cit> . gain of 12p was found to be present in 53% of primary mgcts of children aged 5- <dig> and was also observed in four of fourteen ysts affecting children less than  <dig> years old. the ysts showed an increased frequency of 1p loss , 3p gain , 4q loss  and 6q loss  compared to the germinomatous tumors  <cit> .

in this study, we applied genomic approaches to explore the molecular messages governing the ethnic and prognosis differences of cns gcts. both mrna and mirnome expression patterns were studied in pediatric primary cns gcts. to provide novel insights into gct pathogenesis, the transcriptomes of all gct cases were further compared to those of es cell lines from both caucasian and taiwanese genetic backgrounds  <cit> . copy number variations  in different gct subtypes were also measured to evaluate their possible influence on gene expression traits. finally, the transcriptomes of our patients were organized into functional modules in order to identify the dominant biological processes and key genes in the germinomas and ngmgcts; this sought to help explain the clinical observations associated with these tumors.

RESULTS
clinical aspects of primary pediatric cns gcts examined
in our series of  <dig> cases of primary pediatric cns gcts,  <dig> % were germinoma and  <dig> % were nongerminomatous gcts . among the germinomas,  <dig> % had a histological diagnosis, while the remaining  <dig> % of cases had a presumptive diagnosis. for ngmgcts,  <dig> % had a histological diagnosis, with the remaining cases having a presumptive diagnosis. each presumptive diagnosis of the gcts was made according to the tumor's clinical features, neuroimaging results, serum tumor marker level  and response to radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. subtypes of nggcts included mature teratomas , various ngmgcts including immature teratomas, mixed gcts, pure ysts, and tumors diagnosed by tumor markers , and unclassified gcts   the 5-year, 10-year and 15-year overall survival rates for the germinomas and ngmgcts were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the germinomas and  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the ngmgcts.

kaplan-meier estimator analysis and log-rank test revealed that the germinoma patients had a better overall survival than the ngmgct patients . accordingly, therapeutic classification of the gcts represents prognostic factor-based classification and management. however, the therapeutic classification of cns gcts is quite different between the cns gcts and extra-cns gcts, because of rareness of systemic metastasis of the cns gcts  <cit> . according to the clinical and therapeutic classification of cns gcts  <cit> , in our series of cns gcts in children,  <dig> cases , including  <dig> germinomas,  <dig> mature teratomas, and  <dig> mixed germinoma and mature teratoma, were categorized as members of the good prognostic group ,  <dig> cases, including  <dig> immature teratomas and  <dig> mixed gcts, were categorized as members of the intermediate prognostic group , and  <dig> cases, including  <dig> pure yolk sac tumors and  <dig> mixed gcts dominated by yolk sac tumors, were categorized as members of the poor prognostic group   <cit> . for the  <dig> cases that underwent genomic studies , cases 1- <dig> could be categorized as members of the gpg and these included  <dig> pure germinomas,  <dig> mature teratomas, and  <dig> mixed germinoma- mature teratoma. cases 13- <dig> could be categorized as members of the ipg and included  <dig> mixed gcts and  <dig> immature teratoma. cases 19- <dig> belonged to the ppg and included  <dig> mixed gcts with yst component predominance .

the microrna signatures associated with the different pediatric cns gct prognostic groups
global mirna expression patterns  were analyzed in  <dig> cases . differentially expressed mirnas that correlated with the germinoma group  and the ngmgct group  were identified by 2-tailed student's t-test with a significance level of p <  <dig>  plus ≧2-fold changes. their discrimination ability was assessed by principle component analysis . thus, patients within the different prognosis groups were separated by their distinct mirna profiles . a heat map of these mirnas indicates the unique expression levels associated with each prognostic group . two mirnas  are enriched in the germinoma group  and  <dig> mirnas are enriched in the ngmgct group  . the differential expression levels of the mirnas across the two different histological categories and prognostic groups of the pediatric cns gcts were organized by array hybridization intensity  and verified by quantitative pcr  . the expression levels of hsa-mir-142-5p, hsa-mir- <dig> and mir-654-3p were found to be different when the patients in these two different groups were compared .

stem cell traits associated with the expression patterns of protein-coding gene within the ngmgct group
the expression patterns of the protein-coding genes of the same  <dig> cases described above together with  <dig> additional germinoma case , were also analyzed. in total,  <dig> probe sets were specifically enriched in the germinoma group  compared to  <dig> ones in ngmgct group  with a strict positive false discovery rate  threshold of q <  <dig>  . the discrimination ability of these probe sets was assessed by a multidimensional scaling  assay . the top  <dig> transcripts most strongly expressed in the germinoma group  or the ngmgct group  among the pediatric cns gcts are shown in table  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. in the germinoma group , the presence of mmp- <dig>  which is involved in promoting tumor metastasis, needs to be noted  <cit>  . podoplanin, a significant lymphatic endothelial cell marker, is also found in the top  <dig> genes of this group. podoplanin is expressed by cancer associated fibroblasts  and has been shown to be correlated with a poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinomas  <cit> . in addition, pou5f <dig> , a significant transcription factor involved in maintaining the stemness of es cells  <cit> , is also among the top  <dig> genes in this group . among the members of the gp group, the nanog and klf <dig> stemness factors are overexpressed . these stemness genes can induce pluripotency in somatic cells and then reprogram them back to a pluripotent status so that they have the essential characteristics of embryonic stem  cells  <cit> . another pluripotency associated gene, dpp <dig> , is also highly expressed in germinomas. finally, spermatogenesis- and oogenesis-related genes, such as spata <dig> , spesp <dig>  and gtsf <dig> , were also found to be expressed more abundantly in germinomas than in ngmgcts .

in the ngmgct group , genes involved in cell adhesion and migration, such as cadherin  <dig>  and various collagens, are abundantly expressed . snai <dig>  and twist <dig>  two key regulators involved in neural crest development and epithelial-mesenchymal transition , are also highly expressed in this group; these proteins are known to contribute heavily to cell motility and tumor metastasis  <cit> . finally, genes such as fzd <dig> and sfrp <dig>  which are involved in the wnt signaling pathway, are also highly expressed .

it has been recognized that aggressive and poor prognostic glioblastomas, as well as other tumors, acquire characters reminiscent of embryonic stem cells  and the degree of esc gene expression correlates with patient prognosis  <cit> . it is possible that pediatric cns gcts, especially the poor prognosis ngmcgts, are reminiscent of es cells. we compared the gene expression patterns of pediatric gcts to those of caucasian and taiwanese esc lines. pca analysis showed that ngmgcts have a closer relationship to es cells . the esc array data from five different data sets  and gse <dig> and gse <dig>  were all grouped together  and possible batch effects during array analysis were ignored. to provide quantitative insights, we calculated the relationships between the gct subgroups and the escs by measuring the average linkage euclidean distances between them. ngmgcts were found to closer to the esc than the germinomas .

the closer relationship between ngmgcts and escs was verified further by hierarchical clustering. as shown in figure. 2d, clearly the ngmgcts and escs form one group while the germinomas form another. in total,  <dig> genes commonly show high-expression between ngmgcts and escs . among these genes the following are notable. irs <dig>  is an effector of sonic hedgehog mitogenic signaling in cerebellar neural precursors  <cit>  and regulates murine embryonic stem cell self-renewal  <cit>  . mid <dig> is a ring finger transcription factor involved in opitz syndrome and is expressed strongly in undifferentiated cells in the central nervous system as well as the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract epithelium of human embryos  <cit> . embryonic oncogenes such as net <dig> , hif3a , ets <dig>  runx1t <dig>  and the wnt signaling pathway genes  also appear in this cluster . however, notably, two key emt genes, snai <dig>  and twist <dig>  are uniquely expressed by ngmgcts .

among the genes commonly found to show abundant expression in both the escs and germinomas, the pluripotent stemness genes dpp <dig> and pou5f <dig>  are significant . the array hybridization signal for pou5f <dig> is shown in figure. 2e. the high expression of pou5f <dig>  as well as that of another stemness gene nanog in germinomas, was verified by qpcr . in contrast, snai <dig>  is overexpressed in ngmgcts .

relationships between abundant micrornas and their target mrnas
the most differentiating mirnas between the histological subgroups were used to predict their mrna targets. this was performed by examining whether there were any candidate mirna target genes, the expression of which became significantly higher in a given group of tumors, which also showed a correlated reduction in the related mirnas. this analysis yielded mirna-target pairs that showed opposite expression patterns in the same prognostic group . in the germinoma group, the expression levels of runx1t <dig> and thrb were inversely correlated with expression of mir-146a, and the levels of nrp <dig>  svil and pdgfra were inversely correlated with the expression of mir-142-5p. furthermore, runx1t <dig> is a putative target of both mir-142-5p and mir-146a . in the ngmgct group, inverse correlation expressions were also found between mirnas and their candidate downstream targets , specifically, mir- <dig>  which is an intragenic mirna of the overexpressed slit <dig> gene .

na: no mirna target could be found in the opposite group.

underlined: genes targeted by  <dig> micrornas.

in bold and underlined: genes targeted by more then  <dig> micrornas.

the signature mirnas in the same gct prognosis group were found to target the same mrnas. mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> both target pafah1b <dig> and rnf <dig>  while mir-26a and mir- <dig> both target crebl <dig> and dnaja <dig> . in addition, frat <dig> is a putative target of both mir-26a and mir- <dig>  atp11c is a target of both mir-26a and mir- <dig>  nmt <dig> is a target of both mir-181c and mir- <dig>  wnt2b is a target of both mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  n4bp <dig> is a target of both mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  and osbpl <dig> is a target of both mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> . some mrnas are even targeted by more than two mirnas: nup <dig> is targeted by three mirnas , while wapal is a target of four mirnas . thus it would seem that there are complex and highly interactive mirna-mrna genetic networks active in germinomas and ngmgcts.

functional module and pathway analysis as a framework for the interpretation of gct biology
the gene list outlined above gave us preliminary insights into the functional consequences of detected differential gene expression. to understand more about how the gene expression profiles might be correlated with pathogenesis and the various clinical phenotypes as well as to provide quantitative evidence, the signature mrnas were subjected to a gene ontology  database search  <cit>  in order to find statistically overrepresented functional groups within the gene lists. the webgestalt web tool  <cit>  was applied to provide statistical analysis and visual presentation of the results. the go categories of biological processes that were statistically overrepresented  among genes of the germinoma group are shown in figure 3a. genes chek <dig> and hus <dig>  which are involved in the dna damage checkpoint, were significantly overexpressed in germinomas . another significant biological process associated with this group is related to the immune system processes . other predominant processes in the gp group include genes pertaining to reproduction  and male gonad development .

in contrast, the principal functions of the p-regulated genes in the ngmgct group  of pediatric gcts include those related to small gtpase  mediated signal transduction , cell motility  and various genes associated with active differentiation processes, in particular neuron differentiation . seven genes involved in the wnt receptor signaling pathway are also significantly active in this group . when the genes  are subjected to a kegg pathway database to obtain a similar module analysis using the david  <dig> web-based tool, the top-ranked canonical pathways in the ngmgct group again include cell motility , axon guidance and wnt signaling . expression of wnt pathway genes  have been previously reported in a pluripotent human embryonal carcinoma cell line and in an embryonic stem cell  <cit> , which supports the reliability of our functional module analysis. fzdi, fzd <dig>  fzd <dig> and sfrp <dig> are also in our gene list . the detailed locations of the signature genes are indicated in additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig> 

chromosome locations of the differentially expressed genes and cytogenetic analysis of the gcts
gene set enrichment analysis  was performed by david for all chromosomal arms using the entire gene list. ngmgcts were found to shows significantly transcript expression in the 7q <dig> cytoband region, which contains  <dig> ngmgct genes: gng <dig> , gamma 11), gnai <dig>  and fzd <dig> . in germinomas, genes were overexpressed at xq <dig> , 14q <dig>  , 1p <dig>  , 12q <dig> , 6p <dig>   and 20q <dig> -q <dig>  . the pou5f <dig>  germinoma gene, as well as slc4a <dig>  loc <dig> and c12orf <dig>  are overexpressed at chr12q <dig> . the spermatogenesis associated gene spata <dig>  as well as ptpn <dig>  are overexpressed at 20q <dig> -q <dig>  .

it is likely that gene expression changes are attributable to underlying chromosomal aberrations. to identify such a correlation, we examined the cytogenetic abnormalities present in each gct prognosis subtype. copy number variation  analysis was performed on  <dig> pediatric cns gct cases  in order to detect chromosomal aberrations. a data set containing  <dig> human  <dig> m hapmap samples  was used as a copy number baseline. the aberrant chromosome regions in each tested individual are summarized in additional file  <dig>  as shown in figure.  <dig>   <dig> out of  <dig> ngmgct cases have a reduced dna copy number between 4q <dig> -4q <dig>   and 9p <dig> -9q <dig> . the protein-coding genes and mirnas located in these changed regions are shown in table  <dig>  bank <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  ddit4l, elovl <dig> and herc <dig> are within 4q <dig> -4q <dig>  and are relatively more abundant in germinomas . ddit4l, elovl <dig> and herc <dig> are also among the top  <dig> most dominant genes in germinomas .

underlined and in bold: genes which are relatively more dominant in germinomas.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
gct is a specific type of cns tumor with several subtypes. the two major forms of these tumors, germinoma  and ngmgct , present with different clinical behaviors, differences in sensitivity to therapeutic regimens and different outcomes. the overall survival of patients with germinomas is significantly better than that of patients with ngmgcts in our series  and this is similar to other previously reported series  <cit> . to explore the molecular difference between these two different histological/therapeutic prognostic groups, we have identified with confidence a number of differentially expressed mirnas and mrna; these permit an interpretation of the clinical survival variations and downstream hypothesis testing. the various divergent biological functions that correlate with the clinical observations are also revealed.

among these mirnas, mir-142-5p and mir-146a are upregulated in the pediatric germinomas  when compared to the ngmgcts . up to the present, no mirna profile of pediatric gcts has been published. a mirnome report on adult gonadal gcts showed that, for each gct subtype, the mirna patterns are quite different  <cit> . in their dataset, mir-142-5p and mir-146a are also more abundant in adult seminomas than in gonadal ecs  <cit> . in addition, let-7e, mir-133b, mir- <dig> and mir-654-3p are also abundant in both pediatric ngmgcts and adult ecs   <cit> . however, the notable discrepancies are mir-181c and mir- <dig>  the expression levels of which are more abundant in adult testicular seminomas but are lower in pediatric intracranial germinomas   <cit> . the unique expression pattern of these mirnas in pediatric cns gcts may reflect the differences in pathogenesis mechanisms between adult and pediatric gcts  <cit> , or, alternatively, the variation in genetic makeup between western and taiwanese patients.

we also correlated the transcript levels of mirnas to their candidate targets in order to identify microrna-mrna target pairs . it has been shown that some mirnas, such as mir- <dig>  can downregulate the transcript levels of a large number of target genes in mammalian cells  <cit> . two large scale proteomic studies published very recently have shown that, although some microrna target proteins are repressed without detectable changes in mrna levels, more than a third of translational repressed targets also display detectable mrna destabilization and, for the more highly repressed targets, mrna destabilization usually makes up the major component of repression  <cit> . gene expression microarrays can therefore be, and have been, applied for the identification of downstream targets for mirnas  <cit> . however, proof of direct binding between those mirnas and target mrnas, as well as the direct translational repression of target mrnas, is still needed. such confirmation will require more wetlab experiments such as immunoblotting and reporter assays.

when compared with ngmgcts, the germinomas largely recapitulate the features of self-renewing pluripotent human embryonic stem  cells, such as involvement of pou5f <dig> , nanog and klf <dig> . both seminomas and embryonal carcinomas are known to express stem cell markers, such as pou5f <dig> and nanog  <cit> . in addition, in an attempt to find coordinated overexpressed gene clusters in gcts, korkola et al. found nanog at chromosome 12p <dig>  is overexpressed in undifferentiated  tumors versus differentiated  tumors  <cit> . by overexpressing pou5f <dig>  nanog and klf <dig>  it is now possible to reprogram the transcriptomes of somatic primary cells, which results in their dedifferentiation from matured cells to es cell-like ips  cells  <cit> . the abundant expression of these dedifferentiation factors in germinomas therefore mirrors the more undifferentiated histopathological characteristics of these tumors. whereas such similarities have previously been described for adult and pediatric seminomas  <cit> , we now know that this also applies to asian pediatric cns germinomas.

although germinomas abundantly express the above three stemness factors, it is ngmgcts  who show a closer gene expression pattern to escs . this observation is consistent with pervious global gene expression reports whereby the gene expression patterns of human es cell lines are similar to those of the human embryonal carcinoma cell samples but are more distantly related to those of seminoma samples  <cit> . the close relationship between ngmgcts and es cells supports the hypothesis that germinomas are closely related to primordial germ cells , and ec cells/ngmgcts represent a reversion to a more icm- or primitive ectoderm-like cell type  <cit> . whether germinomas and zygotes/blastomeres share similar mrna or microrna profiles is under investigation at present. the close relationship between ngmgcts and es cells may additionally be reflected in the worse prognosis for these tumors. recently, via novel genomic approaches, it has been shown that aggressive and poor prognostic tumors, such as glioblastomas, inherit preferential es cell gene expression profiles  <cit> . the similarity between pediatric ngmgcts and human es cells may therefore reflect the clinical observation that cns ngmgcts are more malignant and show a higher fatality rate than germinomas.

the close relationship in genetic makeup between ngmgcts and escs also suggest that factors other than pou5f <dig> , nanog or klf <dig> are responsible for esc gene expression. in this study, we found that two key epithelial-mesenchymal transition  regulators, snai <dig>  and twist <dig>  are abundantly expressed in the ngmgct group  . it has been reported that emt transcription factors, snai <dig>  and twist, can independently dedifferentiate mammalian cancer cells and induces the generation of cancer stem-like cells, which then form mammospheres  <cit> . it is possible that snai <dig>  and twist <dig> behaves like snail and twist and can introduce malignancy and stemness in pediatric gcts. targeting oncogenic stemness genes or emt-related embryonic signaling pathways  may differentiate a highly malignant ngmgct into a more matured transcriptome type, thereby increasing the sensitivity of these tumors to the classical therapeutic regimen of radical resection, irradiation and chemotherapy, which would produce a better prognosis for the patients.

in addition to stemness genes , the germinomas were found to overexpress genes involved in the dna damage checkpoint, which indicates active dna integrity checking in the germinomas and thereby reflects why the clinical phenotype of germinomas has a better prognosis . among the other genes that were found to be expressed abundantly in germinomatous tissues were genes associated with the immune system process and this correlates with the abundant lymphocytic infiltration of germinomas found during histological observation. relative to germinomas, we observed a significant enrichment of overexpression of differentiation and morphogenesis  genes in ngmgcts, which correlates with the differentiated state of these tumor cells . there is also evidence of overexpression of genes in the wnt/β-catenin pathway in our dataset , which is consistent with previous studies of nonseminomatous malignant gcts  <cit> . in concordance with the higher recurrence and disseminating clinical behaviors of ngmgcts, a significant enrichment for overexpression of motility, tight junction, focal adhesion, and adherent junction genes in ngmgcts was observed . our results thereby integrate molecular profiles with clinical observations and provide a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. the combined targeting of hub genes involved in all these biological modules by a cocktail therapy-like regimen may eventually lead to an alleviation of these malignant cns tumors.

during the submission of this manuscript, a very recent reference based on testis gcts identified gene expression signatures that predicted outcomes in patients with extra-cranial adult gcts  <cit> . we compared the age and tumor characteristics between our series against the genomic study group of cns gcts in children and the reported study of extra cns gcts in adult men   <cit> . in our series and the genomic study of cns gcts, both germinomas and nggcts in children younger than  <dig> years old were included, whereas korkola's study involved adult men with nonseminomatous gcts   <cit> . in our series,  <dig> tumors were pure germinomas or tumors with a germinoma component,  <dig> tumors were pure teratoma or tumors with a teratoma component, and  <dig> cases were classified as ysts including  <dig> pure ysts,  <dig> tumors with a yst component, and  <dig> cases with serum afp elevation . among the  <dig> cases with genomic studies,  <dig> tumors were pure germinomas,  <dig> tumors were pure mature teratomas, and  <dig> tumors were mixed gcts, including one mature teratoma with serum afp elevation and one germinoma with serum afp elevation. the correlation of tumor characteristics between the studies of korkola et al. and ours in additional file 1-c constituted the basis for the comparison of genomic molecular findings across the different therapeutic prognostic groups and histology between these two studies.

korkola et al. concluded that using a 140-gene signature, they could predict 5-year overall survival    <cit> . both our study and that of korkola et al. identified good outcome gcts express gene sets involved in immune function and the repression of differentiation , while poor outcome gcts express genes involved in active differentiation    <cit> . a 10-gene prognosis model was also built using a univariate cox model. when the samples were dichotomized by median score, there was significant separation of the survival curves   <cit> . these  <dig> genes were stx <dig>  cflar, fnbp <dig>  itsn <dig>  syne <dig>  map3k <dig>  ptgds, pxmp <dig>  irak <dig>  and rabgap1l  <cit> . among these  <dig> genes stx <dig>  and cflar  are over-expressed in our germinoma group . it will be interesting to fit their prognosis signatures onto our dataset to see whether gcts of different anatomic locations, ages and ethnic populations express similar prognosis genes. however, since all the tissues used in our study were freshly collected over the last  <dig> years, only one death has been recorded so far . as a result, this work needs to be carried out at a later stage.

the variation in chromosome copy number variation  regions between germinomas and ngmgcts were mapped to cytobands 4q <dig> -4q <dig>  and 9p <dig> -9q <dig> . chromosome abnormality analysis of adult testicular germ cell tumors  revealed that all gcts show 12p gain  <cit> . in  <dig>  palmer et al. used metaphase-based comparative genomic hybridization  to analyze genomic imbalance in  <dig> pediatric gcts ,  <dig> germinomatous tumors and one metastatic embryonal carcinoma). the ysts showed an increased frequency of 1p loss , 3p gain , 4q loss  and 6q loss  compared to germinomas  <cit> . most of their cases were from the testis, the ovary or the sacrococcygeal region and only  <dig> germinomas and  <dig> yst brain gcts were included  <cit> ; this is a possible explanation of the discrepancies between their results and ours. we also observed 4q loss in the ngmgcts , suggesting that genomic imbalance in this region, and the genes/mirnas encoded by this chromosomal region, may play a crucial tumor suppressing role during ngmgct pathogenesis and affect clinical performance . six genes  within 4q <dig> -4q <dig>  showed higher expression levels in the germinomas . ddit4l, elovl <dig> and herc <dig> are among the top  <dig> highly expressed genes in germinomas . a putative gct tumor suppressor gene synpo <dig> , also known as myopodin, is also within the 4q <dig> -4q <dig>  deletion region . synpo <dig> has recently been shown to have the highest predictive value when assessing 5-year overall survival  <cit> , which is consistent with a possible role as a tumor suppressor. however, we do not observe differential synpo <dig> expression between ngmgcts and germinomas . it is unclear whether synpo <dig> expression is also downregulated in taiwanese germinomas compared to normal brains. in addition, whether survival predictors derived from western cases can be applied to asian patients still awaits elucidation.

recently two independent genome-wide association studies  have reported on susceptibility loci associated with tgct: kanetsky et al. mapped seven markers at 12p <dig> near kitlg  and two markers at 5q <dig>  near spry <dig>   <cit> ; furthermore rapley et al. identified loci on chromosome  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . a third locus, in an intron of bak <dig>  a gene that promotes apoptosis, was also identified by rapley et al.  <cit> . similarly, the cgh profiles in childhood gcts have been reported to resemble those in adults  <cit> . in terms of cytogenetics differences between the different histological entities, loss of chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> material and gain of 5q14-q <dig>  6q21-q <dig> and 13q material were found to occur at a significantly lower frequency in seminoma adult tgcts compared to non-seminoma adult tgcts  <cit> . among taiwanese pediatric gcts, no common copy number variation  could be found in either the germinomas or the mature teratomas . the divergence between our results and published caucasian ones may be partly due to the different ethnic samples used, the application of different bioinformatics algorithms and the fact that we compared the differences between germinomas and ngmgcts but not common aberrations across all gcts.

in summary we have identified mirnome, mrna signatures and cnv regions that are associated with two pediatric gct histological entities  and two prognostic groups . the clinical discrepancies between the two histological entities  are therefore mirrored by their differences in global transcriptome patterns and their unique stem cell traits. one of the interesting questions that remain is whether pediatric gcts from other ethnic background also express similar transcriptome traits and cnv regions. if caucasian and taiwanese gcts possess unique transcriptome traits, therapeutic and diagnostic experience from western countries may not be applicable directly to asian or taiwanese patients. therefore, the genes and mirnas identified here hold the potential of being novel therapeutic targets and may be used for further differentiation therapy. the wnt pathway, for example, is activated in ngmgcts , and drugs targeting this specific pathway may hold potential as a treatment approach to ngmgcts. transdifferentiating esc-like ngmgcts into a benign status may also be a novel and useful tactic against these fatal pediatric tumors.
