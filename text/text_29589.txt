BACKGROUND
wheat  is the most widely grown crop plant, occupying 17% of all the cultivated land, provide approximately 55% of carbohydrates for world human consumption  <cit> , biotic and abiotic stresses are important limiting factors for yield and grain quality in wheat production. for instance, powdery mildew, caused by the obligate biotrophic fungus blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici , is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat in china and worldwide, and causing significant yield losses  <cit> . high temperature, often combined with drought stress, causes yield loss and reduces the grain quality  <cit> . to reduce the damage caused by biotic and abiotic stresses, plants have evolved sophisticated adaptive response mechanisms to reprogram gene expression at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational levels  <cit> . therefore, transcript profiling have been successfully employed to determine the transcriptional responses to powdery mildew infection and heat stress in wheat, and the results revealed that a number of genes were significantly induced or repressed in response to these stresses  <cit> . in addition, much progress has been made in unraveling the complex post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms in response to stress. recently discovered micrornas  and endogenous small interfering rnas  have emerged as important posttranscriptional regulators in plant stress responses  <cit> . however, no report has been published on the roles of small rnas in wheat response to abiotic and biotic stresses.

micrornas  are a class of small rnas that serve as posttranscriptional negative regulators of gene expression in plants and animals  <cit> . up to date, plant mirnas have been shown to function in many plant processes, including developmental transitions  <cit> , leaf growth  <cit> , organ polarity <cit> , auxin signaling  <cit>  and rna metabolism  <cit> . importantly, increasing evidence indicated that mirnas also play important roles in plant response to abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> . the observation that some of the mirnas are up- or down- regulated in response to stress implies that these mirnas could play important roles in stress tolerance  <cit> . for example, in arabidopsis, mir <dig> and other mirnas are induced by cold stress  <cit> . in rice, mir169g and mir <dig> are up-regulated under drought stress  <cit> . arabidopsis mir <dig> directs the cleavage of csd <dig> and csd <dig> mrna under normal conditions, and down-regulation of mir <dig> by oxidative stress results in accumulation of cds <dig> and csd <dig> mrnas  <cit> . recent studies in arabidopsis have also established that mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> are induced in response to phosphate-, sulfate- and cu2+-deprived conditions, respectively  <cit> . in addition, among the  <dig> populus mirna families, expression of some mirnas are altered in response to cold, heat, salinity, dehydration, and mechanical stresses  <cit> . pathogenic bacteria, fungi, viruses, insect pests and nematodes cause severe damage to plants  <cit> . recent discovery also revealed that mir393-guided post-transcriptional regulation plays a crucial role in the plant defense against pathogens through targeting transport inhibitor response  <dig> , an auxin receptor  <cit> . transgenic arabidopsis overexpressing mir393a shows enhanced resistance to virulent p. syringae pv. tomato  <cit> . another report in loblolly pine indicated that expressions of  <dig> mirnas are decreased in response to the rust fungus  <cit> . functional analyses have demonstrated that several plant mirnas play vital roles in plant resistance to abiotic as well as biotic stresses  <cit> .

although some of the stress-responsive mirna families are deeply conserved among various plant species, including arabidopsis, rice and populus, their species-specific function may be the results of adaptation to long-term growth and survival in stressful environment  <cit> . moreover, some species-specific mirnas could also play possible roles in the regulatory networks associated with the stress resistance, and individual mirnas of a family response differentially to stress, suggesting that different members in same mirna family may have different functions  <cit> . recently, a total of  <dig> mirnas comprising  <dig> mirna families have been cloned in wheat  <cit> , however, their expression level in response to abiotic and biotic stress are still unknown. with the development of high-throughput sequencing technology, it became possible to discover several species-specific or lowly expressed mirnas and different members in the same mirna family. in this study, by using solexa high-throughput sequencing, we indentified a diverse set of wheat small rnas which are responsive to powdery mildew infection and heat stress. a total of  <dig> known conserved mirnas and  <dig> new identified mirnas were obtained, increasing the number of wheat mirna families from  <dig> to  <dig>  moreover we also found that many of these wheat mirnas showed differential expression in response to powdery mildew infection and heat stress. in addition,  <dig> genes were predicted as potential targets for novel wheat mirnas, which included transcription factors implicated in development as well as genes involved in other physiological processes, such as stress responses.

RESULTS
high-throughput sequencing of wheat small rnas
to investigate the role of wheat small rna in powdery mildew resistance and heat stress, six small rna libraries were constructed and sequenced. disease susceptible wheat cultivar jingdong <dig>  and its near-isogenic resistant line jingdong8-pm <dig>  with single resistant gene pm <dig> were used for powdery mildew infection and the preponderant physiological strain erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici   was used for powdery mildew infection. non-inoculated and inoculated seedlings of jd <dig> and jd8-pm <dig> were used to construct four small rna libraries, designated jd <dig>  jd8-egt, jd8-pm <dig> and jd8-pm30-egt, respectively. as for heat stress treatment, seedlings of heat tolerant cultivar tam <dig> that undergone 40°c for  <dig> hour and those grown in normal condition were selected to build small rna libraries, designated tam <dig> and tam107-heat, respectively.

these six wheat small rna libraries were sequenced by solexa high-throughput sequencing, and the numbers of raw reads for jd <dig>  jd8-egt, jd8-pm <dig>  jd8-pm30-egt, tam <dig> and tam107-heat were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. to simplify the sequencing data, the identical sequence reads among the  <dig> small rna libraries were grouped and converted into unique sequences. after removing the low quality reads, a total of  <dig> unique sequences ranging from 18- <dig> nt in length were obtained. theoretically, these sequences could cover most of the small rnas in our six samples used in this study.

we assessed the size distribution based on both total abundances and distinct sequences . for total abundance, approximately  <dig> % small rnas were 20- <dig> nt in length, with  <dig> and  <dig> nt being the major size classes . for the proportion of nonredundant sequence of each size, we found that  <dig> nt sequences are prevailing in all the libraries, while the  <dig> nt sequence is less abundant . further analysis revealed that the distribution of nonredundant srnas for various size classes was similar among the six libraries, but the size distribution of redundant srnas was greatly different for egt infection and heat stress treatment. both jd <dig> and jd8-pm <dig> showed a similar pattern of 21-nt small rna reduction and 24-nt small rna increase in abundance after inoculation with egt for  <dig> hours . however, for the library for high temperature treatment both the  <dig> and 24-nt small rnas were reduced in abundance . the canonical mirnas are  <dig> nt while canonical heterochromatic sirnas are  <dig> nt. these observations indicated that the expression of mirnas and sirnas significantly altered after egt infection and heat stress, suggesting that mirnas and sirnas could be involved in the extensive regulation of gene expression in response to powdery mildew infection and heat stress in wheat.

identification of known mirnas
we searched for known mirnas in the six small rna libraries by use of homolog analysis to find mirna sequences  matching at least  <dig> nt and leaving  <dig> nt for possible sequence variations. a total of  <dig> known mirnas from  <dig> families were identified . our previous mirna cloning by  <dig> sequencing in wheat have identified  <dig> mirna families  <cit> , among which  <dig> mirna families were confirmed in current solexa data set, however, other  <dig> families, including tamir <dig>  tamir <dig>  tamir <dig>  tamir <dig>  tamir <dig>  and tamir <dig>  were absent in our current solexa data set. this is probably due to that the small rna library for  <dig> sequencing was constructed from the pooled wheat rna isolated from leaves, roots and spikes. in addition,  <dig> mirna families, which were not found in the previous  <dig> sequencing data, were identified in present study with lower frequency. this indicated that these mirnas were not abundant in wheat and could be detected only in the larger sequencing data set. seven known rice mirnas, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  which were not found in other species like arabidopsis, were also represented in our data set, suggesting that they might belong to monocot-specific mirnas.

identification of novel wheat mirnas
for the identification of novel wheat mirnas, we firstly rely on wheat est sequences as mirna surrounding sequences in prediction, since the information of wheat genome sequence is limited. we found that a total of  <dig>  small rna sequences can be perfectly matched to at least one est. the matched ests were then searched against rfam and protein database to eliminate non-coding rnas such as rrna and trna as well as the degradation products from protein-coding sequences. with this analysis, we obtained  <dig> sequences which are used to predict for fold-back rna secondary structure. and we evaluated reads that fell within potential mirna-like hairpins, considering the following five criteria:  the pairing characteristics of the hairpin;  the expression of the candidate, as measured by the abundance of sequence reads sharing the same 5' terminus; 3) presence in no less than two independent libraries, 4) the presence of mirna* for several new micrornas; 5) the absence of annotation suggesting non-mirna biogenesis. these hairpins were further checked manually to ensure that they were accorded with the new criteria for annotation of plant mirnas, provided recently by meyers et al  <cit> . based on such analysis, we identified a total of  <dig> novel microrna candidates . the length of the newly identified mirnas range from  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp in length, and the negative folding free energies vary from - <dig>  to - <dig>  kcal mol- <dig>  according to mfold, which is similar to the free energy values of other plant mirna precursors . we also found the presence of  <dig> mirna* in our libraries. moreover, we took advantage of approximate 4× depth genomic sequences of brachypodium distachyon, a grass species related to wheat, for further discovery of novel mirnas. a total of  <dig> novel mirnas were identified , among which  <dig>  can not be matched to wheat est sequences due to the limitation of available wheat est sequences.

in order to understand the conservation of new identified wheat mirna, we compared wheat novel mirnas to genomes of species representing important lineages, including maize, arabidopsis, rice, brachypodium distachyon and soybean. among the  <dig> new mirnas,  <dig> were wheat specific, and the others were conserved in different species. for example, mir <dig> was conserved in monocots such as wheat, brachypodium distachyon, rice and maize, suggesting that it might be monocot-specific mirna. mir <dig> and mir <dig> were conserved in brachypodium distachyon, wheat and rice; mir <dig> was conserved in brachypodium distachyon and wheat, mir <dig> was conserved in rice and wheat.

northern detection represents a useful criterion for authenticating mirnas  <cit> . in order to determine the expression patterns of these novel wheat mirnas, we analyzed the expression levels of novel mirnas in leaf, stem, spike and root tissues by northern blot. a total of  <dig> novel mirnas with high frequency in solexa sequencing were tested, and  <dig> showed the obvious signals in northern blot analysis . the results revealed that mir <dig> and mir <dig> were more abundant in stems, spikes and roots than in leaves, while mir <dig> and mir <dig> showed a little more expression level in leaves and roots, respectively.

a total of  <dig> genes were predicted as potential targets for these  <dig> new identified mirnas . up to  <dig> new identified wheat mirnas have predicted targets, whereas  <dig> mirnas do not, which could be due to limitation of wheat est sequences. we found that  <dig> new mirnas have  <dig> targets with definite function, among which  <dig> encode proteins responding to disease or stress,  <dig> for transcription factor,  <dig> encode other proteins and most of them are involved in cellular metabolism. this is quite different as compared to the conserved mirnas, as most of their targets are transcription factors. interesting, we found that  <dig> target genes were putatively regulated by more than  <dig> mirnas. it has also been widely suggested that micrornas, similarly to transcription factors, can act in combination  by binding to the same mrna in a concentration-dependent manner  <cit> .

response of wheat mirnas to powdery mildew infection and heat stress
it has been reported that high-throughput sequencing can be used as a tool for mirna expression profiling  <cit> . therefore, in this study expression profiling of some known and new identified mirnas was also determined based on solexa sequencing data . the mirna frequency was normalized in "transcripts per million  " for each library and we found that the top  <dig> abundant sequences are deeply conserved mirnas. we noted that mir168a, whose abundance relative to the total number of mirnas can reached to 48%, was the most abundant one . previous study also showed that mir168a was also the most abundant mirna in rice in high-throughput sequencing  <cit> . compared to the conserved mirnas, most of the novel mirnas were relatively in low abundance as indicated by their frequencies . among the  <dig> novel mirnas, only  <dig>  had at least  <dig> transcripts per million  in one library with the highest abundance  <dig> tpm for mir <dig>  further analysis revealed that among the  <dig> mirna families represented in present study,  <dig> mirnas had at least  <dig> transcripts per million  in at least one library . firstly, in order to determine the response of wheat mirnas to powdery mildew infection, we compared the tpm value changes before and after infection, and looked for the mirnas that were up- or down- regulated after powdery mildew infection in jd <dig> and jd8-pm <dig> as compared to the controls . by statistical analysis according to poisson distribution, a total of  <dig> mirnas were identified to be significantly responsive to powdery mildew infection in at least one genotype . we classified these mirnas into  <dig> groups according to their expression patterns in different genotypes, that is, jd <dig> specific responsive mirnas , jd8-pm <dig> specific responsive mirnas , mirnas responsive in both jd <dig> and jd8-pm <dig> . group  <dig> contained  <dig> mirnas, among which,  <dig>  were decreased, and  <dig> others  were increased after powdery mildew infection in jd <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> showed the highest expression alteration with  <dig>   <dig>  and - <dig> fold changes. in group  <dig>  mir <dig> was decreased, and  <dig> others  were increased after powdery mildew infection. group  <dig> contained  <dig> mirnas, in which mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were significantly decreased with same expression pattern in jd <dig> and jd8-pm <dig>  the others exhibited the opposite expression pattern in jd <dig> and jd8-pm <dig>  to further characterize the expression of some mirnas that showed significantly alteration in solexa deep sequencing, we performed northern blot analysis for eight mirnas . it was found that after powdery mildew infection mir <dig> was down-regulated both in jd <dig> and jd8-pm <dig>  mir <dig> was down-regulated only in jd8-pm <dig> but not in jd <dig>  mir <dig> was down-regulated only in jd8-pm <dig> but not in jd <dig> .

secondly, in order to identify heat responsive mirnas, we compared normalized expression profiles of mirna families in tam <dig> before and after heat stress . among the  <dig> mirna families,  <dig> were putatively heat responsive according to the statistical analysis . for example, mir <dig> was significantly decreased with  <dig>  fold changes, and  <dig> mirnas, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  were up-regulated with the highest expression change of  <dig>  fold for mir <dig>  we further performed the northern blot analysis to determine the expression patterns of  <dig> mirnas in heat tolerant genotype tam <dig> and heat susceptible genotype chinese spring  after heat treatment for  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> hours and returning to normal growth condition . the results revealed that expression of mir <dig> was up-regulated in both tam <dig> and cs genotypes after heat treatment, mir <dig> was down-regulated only in cs genotype after  <dig> h heat treatment, mir <dig> was up-regulated only in cs genotype after  <dig> h heat treatment, mir <dig> and ta-mir <dig> were up-regulated only in cs genotype after  <dig>  h heat treatment . it was also noted that expression of some mirnas, such as mir <dig> and mir <dig> were significantly changed at  <dig>  h after heat treatment, suggesting that the expression of some mirna are responsive to the vary short heat treatment.

thirdly, we identified that  <dig> mirnas are co-regulated by both powdery mildew infection and heat stress , among which two  were up-regulated both in powdery mildew infection and heat stress, indicating that they might play important roles in both abiotic and biotic stress response in wheat. the others exhibited opposite expression pattern in response to powdery mildew infection and heat stress.

in addition, we also found that the frequency of different members in one mirna family varied greatly, suggesting the functional divergence within families. it is thus important to examine which members of mirna family are more responsive to powdery mildew infection and heat stress. we found that one mirna family in which different members have different expression patterns . for example, the four members of mir <dig> exhibited the different expression pattern in response to stress. mir166a and mir <dig> d were significantly altered after powdery mildew infection, but mir166c and mir <dig> d were not. for heat stress, only mir <dig> d were significantly altered. we also found  <dig> cases  where all the members of a mirna family were expressed at similar pattern in response to powdery mildew infection or heat stress.

expression patterns of potential target genes in response to powdery mildew infection and heat stress
the differential expression of a mirna is expected to have opposite effects on its target gene expression. in this study, we further performed semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis to determine the expression patterns of  <dig> putative target genes of mir <dig> , which is responsive to powdery mildew infection . negative correlations were observed between mir <dig> and its putative target genes ta <dig> and ta <dig>  in accordance with solexa sequencing, mir <dig> was down-regulated in northern blot after powdery mildew infection both in jd <dig> and jd8-pm <dig>  while their putative targets gene ta <dig> and ta <dig> were up-regulated, respectively. then, we tested if the mirna directs the cleavage of putative mrnas using an agrobacterium-mediated delivery system to co-express mir <dig> and ta <dig> mrna in n. benthamiana leaf tissue. four constructs  were inoculated and expressed. co-expression of 35s::ta <dig> with 35s::mir <dig> resulted in loss of the full length ta <dig> transcript form, and co-expression of 35s::mta <dig>  with 35s::mir <dig> resulted in detectable transcripts of the ta <dig> size . the results indicated that mir <dig> directed the cleavage of ta <dig> 

our previous study had identified a number of heat responsive transcripts in tam <dig> treated at 40°c for  <dig> hour by using genechip wheat genome array  <cit> . in this study, by realtime pcr, we determined the expression of tagamyb <dig>  and tagamyb <dig>  targeted by mir <dig> in heat tolerant genotype tam <dig> and heat susceptible genotype cs after heat treatment for  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> hours and returning to normal growth condition . the results indicated that expression of both tagamyb <dig> and tagamyb <dig> were significantly decreased after heat treatment for  <dig>  hours and then increased after  <dig> and  <dig> hours , which was opposite to the expression of mir <dig> 

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
identification of entire set of mirnas and their targets will lay the foundation to unravel the complex mirna-mediated regulatory networks controlling development and other physiological processes. several computational studies estimated that organisms probably contain about 1% mirna genes of the total protein-coding genes  <cit> . recently, a large number of mirna have been found in various species. for example, the identified number of mirna in arabidopsis, rice and maize were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. a total of  <dig> wheat mirnas were identified by  <dig> sequencing,  <cit> . in present study, our solexa high-throughput sequencing of wheat small rnas revealed a diverse and complex small rna population and expression of the  <dig> known plant mirna families  and  <dig> novel mirnas  were determined. this increased the number of known wheat mirna families from  <dig> to  <dig>  although the number of deeply conserved mirna families in wheat largely remains the same as in arabidopsis, all of the newly identified wheat mirnas do not appear to be conserved in arabidopsis and have predicted target genes with more diverse functions than those of conserved mirnas. recent deep sequencing of plant small rna libraries also demonstrated that plants express more non-conserved than conserved mirnas  <cit> . only  <dig> mirnas were conserved in different species, suggesting that wheat appears to have evolved species-specific mirnas because of the functional diversification among the various species. therefore, our study revealed that wheat genome encoded more non-conserved mirna families than conserved mirna families. it has been proposed that these non-conserved mirnas presumably emerged and dissipated in short evolutionary time scales  <cit> , and such rapid emergence of new genes is likely facilitated by the small size and simple architecture of mirna genes  <cit> .

by using northern blotting, at least  <dig> and  <dig> wheat mirnas families were found to be responsive to powdery mildew infection and heat stress, respectively. it is interesting to note that the members of the same mirna family were differentially regulated in the response to powdery mildew infection and heat stress. this is consistent with results obtained from cold-stressed populus  <cit> , drought-stressed rice  <cit>  and uv-b-treated arabidopsis  <cit> . therefore, the functions of plant mirnas can be dissimilar even if they share a high degree of sequence similarity and belong to the same family  <cit> . in addition, several reported stress-responsive mirnas in arabidopsis and populus are also involved in wheat response to powdery mildew infection and heat stress. for example, mir <dig> and mir <dig> were significantly repressed in the galled loblolly pine stem infected with the fungus c. quercuum f.sp.fusiforme  <cit> , and mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were induced in tobacco after plant virus's infection  <cit> . in arabidopsis, mir <dig> and mir <dig> were induced by infection with plant virus tymv p <dig>  and also induced in transgenic arabidopsis plants expressing the viral silencing suppressor p1/hc-pro  <cit> . in this study, we also found that mir <dig> was significantly repressed by powdery mildew infection, whereas, mir <dig> was induced in response to heat stress. it was reported that mir <dig> was induced by a bacterial pamp peptide flg <dig> at  <dig> to  <dig> min post-treatment  <cit> . and in our study, expression of mir <dig> was also strongly increased in jd <dig> under infection of egt. moreover, we also found that  <dig> and  <dig> novel wheat mirnas families were responsive to powdery mildew infection and heat stress. taken together, these stress-related mirnas identified in this study may function in one of the most critical defense systems for wheat biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains an area to be elucidated.

auxin is an important hormone in plants, and involved in many plant processes including cell elongation and thus growth. report shows that susceptible barley cultivar infected by powdery mildew have a remarkably increase of iaa level after inoculation  <cit>  and simultaneously, iaa level decreased after the inoculation by parasite in the resistant barley cultivar "professor schiemann"  <cit> . more recently, it was reported that mir <dig> was involved in auxin signaling pathway and played an important role in basal defense. previous studies revealed that mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> may involve in auxin signaling pathway by regulating different transcription factors. one interesting observation in this study is that the expression patterns of mir <dig> related to auxin signaling pathway was significantly different between near isogenic jd <dig> and jd8-pm <dig>  therefore, we speculated that auxin pathways affected by mirnas could play important roles in powdery mildew disease resistance.
