BACKGROUND
the spread of antibiotic resistance among staphylococcus aureus strains is of great concern in the treatment of staphylococcal infections. since the first methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus  strain was reported in england in  <dig>  <cit> , mrsa has become one of the most prevalent pathogens that cause nosocomial infections throughout the world. recent reports suggest that it has become increasingly prevalent in the community as well since the 1990s  <cit> . in the 2000s, outbreaks of community-associated mrsa  strains were observed worldwide as causative agents of community-associated infections, e.g., superficial skin and soft tissue infections, urinary tract infections and pneumonia  <cit> .

methicillin resistance in mrsa is encoded by the meca gene, which is carried by the sccmec element, a mobile genetic element that carries methicillin resistance  <cit> . the structures of sccmec elements are divergent. at least  <dig> types of sccmec elements have been identified  <cit> . accordingly, mrsa clones are defined by the combination of the genotype of the s. aureus strain and the type of sccmec <cit> . by using molecular epidemiological techniques, it became evident that ca-mrsa strains were distinct from those of healthcare-associated mrsa  strains. the majority of ca-mrsa strains harbour small-sized type iv or type v sccmec elements and are susceptible to many antibiotics  <cit> . in contrast, ha-mrsa isolates carry one of the three types of sccmec  or occasionally types iv and v, and are generally multidrug resistant  <cit> .

interestingly, the majority of ca-mrsa strains that have emerged worldwide carried the luks-pv and lukf-pv genes encoding panton valentine leukocidine. characteristic pvl-positive mrsa clones have been disseminated in each district or continent. in the united states, the st8-sccmeciva  clone and st1-sccmeciva  clone have been predominant. in europe and some asian countries, the st80-type iva sccmec and st59-sccmecv clones have been predominant, respectively. the luks-pv and lukf-pv genes are located on bacteriophages. since the first report of the pvl phage, the nucleotide sequences of several pvl phages have been reported  <cit> . three structurally distinct pvl phages belonging to groups 1- <dig>  have been identified to date.

we characterized the mrsa clones disseminated in tunisian hospitals and the community. in this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the ha-mrsa and ca-mrsa strains isolated from two tunisian hospitals between the years of  <dig> and  <dig>  in order to characterize the mrsa strains, several different molecular typing methods were used: meca gene pcr, sccmec typing, the carriage of pvl gene and the genotyping using the agr locus typing, spa-typing and multilocus sequences typing . furthermore, the nucleotide sequence of the pvl phage carried by one strain was determined.

RESULTS
antimicrobial susceptibility
the ca-mrsa strains were resistant to gentamicin , kanamycin , amikacin , tobramycin , tetracyclines , ofloxacine , ciprofloxacin , erythromycin , clindamycin  and rifampicin . all strains were susceptible to pristinamycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, trimethoprime-sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol. the ha-mrsa strains were resistant to gentamicin , kanamycin , amikacin , tobramycin , tetracyclines , ofloxacine , ciprofloxacin , erythromycin , trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole , chloramphenicol , clindamycin , rifampicin  and fosfomycine . all strains were sensitive to pristinamycin, vancomycin and teicoplanin.

characteristics of ha-mrsa clones
the characteristics of  <dig> ha-mrsa strains are summarized in table  <dig>  twenty-one strains were pvl positive, while  <dig> strains were pvl negative. all pvl-positive strains belonged to the predicted founder group   <dig> in the mlst genotype . all strains belonged to agr group iii, and four spa-types  were identified among them. all pvl-positive strains carried the type ivc sccmec element. in contrast, the pvl-negative clones were very diverse. eight sts, three agr groups, and more than nine spa types were identified . these strains carried sccmec elements of type i, iii, ivc, or were nontypeable . accordingly, at least eight mrsa clones  were identified in the  <dig> pvl-negative ha-mrsa strains, whereas there were only two mrsa clones, st80-sccmecivc and st1440-sccmecivc in pvl-positive ha-mrsa strains.

and: could not be detected.

bnt: non typeable.

characteristics of ca-mrsa strains
the characteristics of the  <dig> isolated ca-mrsa strains are summarized in table  <dig>  twenty-two strains  were pvl-positive and six strains  were pvl-negative. all pvl-positive strains belonged to fg <dig> and agr group iii, and carried the type ivc or nt sccmec element similar to the cases of pvl-positive ha-mrsa strains. three spa-types  were identified among them. the pvl-negative strains belonged to four fgs , three agr groups, i- iii, and there were more than four spa types . these strains carried sccmec elements of type ivc or nt. as a result, five mrsa clones  were identified in six pvl-negative ca-mrsa strains.

sccmec elements identified in tunisian mrsa
as listed in table  <dig>  the sccmec type of  <dig> out of  <dig> mrsa strains were classified by one of the extant types. all pvl-positive ha-mrsa strains and the majority of ca-mrsa strains carried type iv sccmec of subtype c. three pvl-positive ca-mrsa strains carried class b mec, but no ccr genes were identified so far. we expressed this as “nt-b”. sccmecnt-b was identified in three pvl-negative strains belonging to st <dig> and st <dig>  the sccmec elements of the other four strains were expressed as follows: nt- <dig> , nt-a , nt-n , and nt-bc .

the characteristics of lysogenized pvl phage
we determined the nucleotide sequence of a pvl phage lysogenized in a pvl-positive ca-mrsa strain, jcsc <dig>  isolated in  <dig>  the strain belonged to st <dig> and carried nontypeable sccmec . this phi7401pvl was  <dig>  bp in length from the rightmost phage attachment site  to the leftmost site , in which  <dig> predicted orfs larger than  <dig> bp were identified. the core sequences of  <dig> nucleotides were located at both ends of phi7401pvl. the g+c content of phi7401pvl was  <dig> %, and was comparable to other staphylococcal phages. the overall organization of phi7401pvl was the same as that of previously-reported pvl phages, which consisted of five regions relating to 1) lysogeny, 2) dna replication/transcriptional regulation, 3) structural modules , 4) the lysis module, and 5) luks-pv and lukf-pv . the phage was highly homologous to phisa2mw, which belongs to group  <dig> of sfi21-like siphoviridae . the entire genome of the phage showed nucleotide identity of more than 95% to that of phisa2mw. forty-two of the  <dig> orfs were highly homologous to those of phisa2mw, with the nucleotide identities ranging from 91-100% . the int gene was truncated, although it was highly homologous to extant pvl phages. two orfs, tup <dig> encoding na/k atpase and tup <dig> encoding dutpase, were less homologous to phisa2mw.

in order to determine whether the tunisian pvl positive strains also carried the same pvl phage as phi7401pvl, we conducted two pcr studies to identify the regions in common with two pvl phages : a long range pcr study identifying gene linkage luks and the tail gene that can identify pvl phages of the elongated head type and another pcr study identifying the region related to lysogeny . in our experiments, all the pvl positive strains were positive in both pcr studies.

discussion
antibiotic resistance to agents other than β-lactams
the majority of the ha-mrsa isolates were resistant to kanamycin, amikacin and tetracycline. although the ratio was slightly low , these strains were also frequently resistant to tobramycin, gentamicin, erythromycin, quinolones and rifampicin. recently, it has been reported that rifampicin resistance is related to glycopeptides resistance  <cit> . since the ratio of rifampicin resistant strains was relatively high, there is a possibility that there might be glycopeptides related to low resistance strains, e.g., hetero-visa strains. however, glycopeptide resistance is beyond the focus of this study, so we did not examine the details for these findings.

similar to ha-mrsa isolates, the majority of ca-mrsa isolates were resistant to kanamycin, amikacin and tetracycline, but were susceptible to other antibiotics, except for erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. these data suggest that tunisian ca-mrsa strains were more resistant to kanamycin, tetracycline and erythromycin than u.s. and oceanian isolates  <cit> . in our study, only four ca-mrsa strains were resistant to clindamycin, thus suggesting that clindamycin can be used for the treatment of ca-mrsa infections in tunisia.

the pvl phage carried by tunisian mrsa
the phi <dig> carried by a st <dig> tunisian mrsa was highly homologous to phisa2mw carried by st1-sccmeciva mrsa. only two orfs, tup <dig> and tup <dig>  showed a lower identity to those of phisa2mw. interestingly, tup <dig> was identical to orfs in phi <dig>  phi <dig>  and the bacteriophage in mrsa strains jh <dig> and jh <dig>  and tup <dig> was highly homologous to dutpase in phislt and phi108pvl, with nucleotide identities of 97%. these data suggest that the components of phages were chimeric. numerous lysogenized phages were induced from the cells of four strains, including jcsc <dig> by mitomycin c induction. however, a hybridization experiment with a pvl probe showed that no plaque of the pvl phase was observed. this might have been due to the carriage of a truncated int. it seems that lysogenization of the phage occurred early to thus cause a mutation in the phage genome or that the st <dig> strains might have an ability to cause a mutation in the int to keep the inserted phage genome in the chromosome in a stable form.

characteristics of tunisian mrsa
we determined mlst genotype of all  <dig> mrsa strains. our data clearly indicated that all pvl-positive mrsa strains belonged to predicted founder group   <dig>  which was previously indicated as clonal complex   <dig> at the mlst website. in contrast, the pvl-negative mrsa strains belonged to diverse fgs. in this study, we used the fg, which is used at present in the eburst system on the mlst website. however, by using the old cc system, we can distinguish some lineages more clearly, e.g., st <dig> that carries type iii sccmec as cc <dig> and st <dig> that carries type ii sccmec as cc <dig>  both of which belonged to fg <dig>  therefore, we listed both the present and former grouping systems in table  <dig> 

the agr types were well correlated with the mlst genotypes; group i, sts  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 1819; group ii, sts  <dig> and 22; group iii, sts  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and new. there was only one exceptional case of a st <dig> strain belonging to the agr group ii. further experiments including nucleotide sequence determination will be needed to clarify this discrepancy.

the sccmec types of the strains were further determined by multiplex pcr studies, leaving  <dig> strains still nontypeable. the type ivc sccmec was the most representative one in tunisia. it was identified both in ca-mrsa  and ha-mrsa . pvl-positive mrsa strains carried sccmec ivc and nt-b, which was supposed to be a novel sccmec type.

the characteristics of tunisian mrsa strains were also reported by ben nejma et al  <cit> . it has also been reported that the cc <dig> ca-mrsa strains were predominant clones in tunisia, similar to many europeans countries like france, belgium, and switzerland  <cit> . the predominance of the type ivc sccmec stain was also reported.

the majority of our ca-mrsa  and ha-mrsa  isolates were pvl-positive and belonged to fg <dig>  our study suggested that the pvl-positive mrsa strains disseminated in tunisia might be unique to tunisia or the surrounding countries. although cc <dig> pvl positive mrsa strains have been identified in european countries  <cit> , the majority of them carried a type iva sccmec element or their sccmec subtype was not determined. while two ca-mrsa isolates from belgium  <cit>  were reported to belonged to st153-mrsa-iv, the report did not show its subtype.

according to previous studies, pvl-positive mrsa isolates were reported to be associated with an agr group iii background  <cit> . among our ca-mrsa isolates, the most predominant agr group was group iii, followed by group ii, then group i.

the pvl-positive mrsa clones disseminated in other countries belonged to st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig>  and carried distinct sccmec elements. recently, st <dig> has been associated with ca-mrsa strains in the united states and in ireland  <cit>  and the st <dig> and st <dig> strains have been reported in australia and india, respectively  <cit> . these data suggest that the possibility of simultaneous co-evolution of ca-mrsa organisms in different locations  <cit>  is higher than the possibility of dissemination of a single ca-mrsa clone all over the world. pvl positive strains might therefore have emerged elsewhere and spread in the community and at hospitals.

it is interesting that the pvl-negative mrsa clones were the same mrsa strains isolated in other countries. two other ca-mrsa isolates belonged to st5-mrsa-iv which is one of predominant clones in the netherlands  <cit> . concerning the ha-mrsa, the agr group i was predominant, as reported previously in tunisian mrsa  <cit> . the predominance of a group i background was also reported in united states and in korea  <cit> . similar results were obtained in european countries such as germany and belgium  <cit> . three isolates belonged to the clone st241-sccmeciii. two belonged to the st247-sccmeci  clone, which is one of predominant clones in poland  <cit> . two other isolates belonged to st239-sccmeciii  clone, which is predominant in turkey  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
tunisian pvl positive mrsa strains carried the pvl phage, which was highly homologous to phisa2mw, but distinct in two orfs. they belonged to fg <dig> and agr group iii, and carried type ivc or nontypeable sccmec. such strains disseminated in the community and might have spread at the tunisian hospitals by taking over existing mrsa clones, e.g., cc8-sccmeci and cc8-sccmeciii.
