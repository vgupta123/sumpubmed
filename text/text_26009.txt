BACKGROUND
the dead/h box family of rna helicases has been demonstrated to be involved in virtually all processes that require manipulation of rna including transcription, pre-mrna and pre-rrna processing, rna export, ribosome assembly and translation  <cit> . although, in vitro, several members of this family have been shown to unwind rna duplexes, relatively few appear to be true processive helicases and it is clear that, in the cell, many are likely to be involved in unwinding of short base paired regions of rna or in the modulation of rna-protein interactions.

dna helicases belong to a superfamily of proteins that is distantly related to dead/h box rna helicases and includes the werner syndrome protein   <cit>  and the xeroderma pigmentosum xpb and xpd proteins  <cit> , which have well established roles in transcription. although the functions of dead/h box rna helicases in other cellular processes, such as pre-mrna processing and translation have been well studied, their role in transcriptional regulation is only now emerging. examples of dead/h box rna helicases involved in transcription include rna helicase ii  and rna helicase a . rhii/gu was demonstrated to be a cofactor for c-jun-activated transcription  <cit>  and was shown to translocate from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm after uv or anisomycin treatment . although rhii/gu was found to associate with phosphorylated c-jun in a non-phosphorylated state, this association was observed to increase after anisomycin treatment, implying a stronger interaction when c-jun is phosphorylated  <cit> . rha is a homologue of the drosophila maleless  gene product  <cit>  and is thought to be important for gene dosage compensation on the x-chromosome  <cit> . rha has been shown to be required for complex formation between the transcriptional co-activator, creb binding protein , and rna polymerase ii  <cit> . furthermore, different regions of the rna helicase protein were found to interact with both cbp and rna polymerase ii. the association of rha with rna polymerase ii was further investigated, and narrowed down to a  <dig> amino acid stretch, outwith the conserved helicase motifs  <cit> ; this study also showed that rha could regulate creb-dependent transcription either through recruitment of pol ii or by atp-dependent mechanisms. a later study reported that rha acts as a bridging molecule between the breast tumour specific transcriptional activator, brca <dig> and the rna polymerase ii holoenzyme complex  <cit> . these reports thus provide clear evidence of a role for rna helicases as transcription factors.

p <dig> is a prototypic member of the dead box family of proteins  <cit>  and an established rna helicase  <cit> . the subsequent discovery of p <dig>  <cit>  and the finding that p <dig> and p <dig> share remarkable homology  suggests that these proteins may form a specific sub-group of dead box proteins and may have similar, but perhaps subtly different, functions in the cell, perhaps through interaction with different rna substrates or proteins. in vitro, both proteins exhibit the rna-dependent atpase and rna helicase activities characteristic of members of the dead box family  <cit>  and have also been reported to catalyse rearrangement of rna structure via branch migration  <cit> . moreover p <dig> and p <dig> can interact with each other, as well as self-associate, and appear to preferentially form heterodimers in cells  <cit> . this provides the potential for a wide range of functions for p <dig> and p <dig> with the possibility of their co-operation in some contexts.

more recently p <dig> and p <dig> have been shown to be involved in a range of processes in the cell, including pre-mrna and pre-rrna processing and alternative splicing  <cit> . p <dig> and p <dig> have also been shown to be growth- and developmentally-regulated  <cit>  and, furthermore, p <dig> appears to be over-expressed and poly-ubiquitylated in colorectal tumours  <cit> . interestingly p <dig> has been shown to act as a transcriptional co-activator, specific for the activation function  <dig>  domain of estrogen receptor alpha   <cit> . this interaction was dependent upon phosphorylation of af- <dig> at serine <dig>  a residue phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinase . interestingly the rna helicase function of p <dig> appeared to be dispensable for this activity as a mutant p <dig>  in the atp binding site  retained the ability to co-activate erα, although in a later study rna binding appeared to be required  <cit> . p <dig> was subsequently shown to share this property and both proteins were shown to interact with the activation domain  <dig>  of p <dig> co-activators  <cit> . furthermore p <dig> was also found to interact with the cbp co-activator and rna polymerase ii  <cit> . more recently p <dig> has been shown to be recruited to the promoter of the erα target gene ps <dig>  <cit> , suggesting a direct involvement in transcriptional regulation.

in this report we explore further potential mechanisms through which p <dig> and p <dig> may contribute to transcriptional regulation. we find that, in some contexts, p <dig> and p <dig> can also act as transcriptional repressors and that these proteins exhibit clear promoter specificity in this function. by directing gal4-tagged p68/p <dig>  to promoters containing gal <dig> binding sites, we show that both p <dig> and p <dig> can repress transcription from the herpes virus thymidine kinase  promoter but not the simian virus  <dig> promoter/enhancer. moreover, while p <dig> can repress transcription from the adenovirus major late promoter, p <dig> appears to have no effect, suggesting that these proteins do not behave in an identical way in all contexts. furthermore we show, by co-immunoprecipitation, that both p <dig> and p <dig> interact with histone deacetylase  <dig>  and that hdac1/p68/p <dig> co-elute by gel filtration, indicating that they exist in the same complex in the cell and suggesting a possible mechanism by which these proteins may exert their repressive effect.

RESULTS
p <dig> and p <dig> differentially repress constitutively active promoters/enhancers
in order to determine whether, in addition to their reported role as co-activator proteins  <cit> , p <dig> and p <dig> helicases have any intrinsic transcriptional activity we generated plasmids to express p68-/p72-gal <dig> dna binding domain  fusion proteins . u2os cells were then co-transfected with p68g <dig>  p72g <dig>  or gal4-tagged pcdna <dig>  plasmid as a control, and a herpes virus thymidine kinase promoter/chloramphenicol acetyl transferase  reporter plasmid  bearing  <dig> copies of the gal <dig> binding site, and cat activity was measured in standard assays. the amount of tk-cat used had previously been titrated to give a basal level of activity within the linear range of measurement in the cat assay system used . interestingly, we observed a marked decrease in cat activity for both p68g <dig> and p72g <dig> . this was confirmed using other cell lines, including mcf- <dig> and  <dig> hek . as many transcription factors have been shown to act differentially depending upon promoter context  <cit> , we also tested the transcriptional activity of p <dig> and p <dig> with the adenovirus major late promoter , and the sv <dig> promoter/enhancer . in each case we used the same amount of p68g4/p72g <dig> dna as previously and appropriate amounts of the reporter constructs that would give similar basal levels of cat activity using the gal <dig> control plasmid . the amounts of reporter plasmid dna transfected had again been titrated previously to give similar basal levels, which were within the linear range . we also confirmed that p <dig> and p <dig> were not limiting under these conditions . surprisingly p <dig> and p <dig> acted differentially with the mlp promoter, with p <dig> acting as a repressor, while p <dig> had no significant effect on cat activity. furthermore, neither p <dig> nor p <dig> repressed transcription from the simian virus  <dig> promoter/enhancer . western blotting, using an antibody against gal <dig> confirmed that p <dig> and p <dig> were expressed at similar levels in these cells . taken together these results reveal not only that p <dig> and p <dig> appear to have a previously unknown transcriptional repressive ability, but also that this activity is variable depending on the promoter context.

the repression of transcription is an active process
to confirm that the repressive effect observed is not due to an artefact of the assay conditions we initially repeated the experiment with the tk-cat reporter plasmid, using non-tagged p <dig> or p <dig> or the pcdna <dig> expression plasmid vector alone . in this experiment neither p <dig> nor p <dig> significantly reduce transcription of the tk-cat reporter, suggesting that the repression observed with the gal4-tagged p68/p <dig> plasmids  is not due to competing out of an essential factor required for tk-cat transcription but, instead, implies an active mechanism of repression in which the p68/p <dig> proteins are required to be directed to the tk-cat promoter via the gal <dig> tag.

the possibility still remained that p <dig> and p <dig> were repressing transcription by direct interference with the transcriptional machinery of the tk-cat promoter . to rule out this possibility, we used a similar tk-cat promoter construct, which had, however, a  <dig>  kb dna 'spacer' between the gal <dig> binding sites and the promoter . both gal4-p <dig> and -p <dig> retained the ability to repress transcription, almost to the same degree as previously . furthermore, a titration using the gal4- p68/p <dig> fusion proteins clearly shows a dose-dependent concentration curve  as would be expected for active repression. in addition, p <dig> and p <dig> have been observed to interact with p300/cbp co-activators  <cit> . therefore it remained possible that the observed transcriptional repression was due to competition for, or interference with, p300/cbp. if this were the case co-expression of p300/cbp would be expected to relieve repression by p68/p <dig>  as shown in figure 2d, no such relief of expression was observed. thus our findings that transcriptional repression by p68/p <dig> was dose-dependent and not due to steric blocking of the promoter or competition/interference with p300/cbp, suggest that it is an active process.

deletion experiments do not identify a distinct repression domain for p <dig> or p <dig> but reveal an activation domain
to determine whether specific regions or domains of p <dig> and p <dig> act as transcriptional repressors, we performed cat assays, again using the tk-cat reporter, but with a range of deletion derivatives of p68/p <dig> covering the entire coding region. deletion derivatives encompassing domains between amino acids 1– <dig> and 1– <dig> for p <dig> and p <dig> respectively repressed transcription in this assay while the c-terminal region for both proteins  acted as a strong transcriptional activator . residues 1– <dig> of p <dig> and 1– <dig> of p <dig> include all the conserved motifs that characterise the dead box family of proteins . within this conserved core we have shown that there are three domains, which can independently repress transcription , while the complete region  can repress as well as the full-length respective proteins. additionally, the finding that the c-terminal regions of p <dig> and p <dig> activate transcription is consistent with earlier reports of transcriptional activation by p68/p <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, atpase inactive mutants of p <dig> and p <dig>  as well as the more recently identified p <dig>  also repress transcription . thus atpase and helicase activity appear to be dispensable for transcriptional repression suggesting that this function of p68/p <dig> may not specifically require rna unwinding; again this is consistent with reports that helicase activity is not required for co-activation of erα transcriptional activity  <cit>  although another report suggested that p <dig> helicase activity is required for synergism with the transcriptional co-activators cbp/p <dig>  <cit> .

p <dig> immunoprecipitates a hdac activity
many studies have implicated histone deacetlyase  proteins in active repression of transcription, and many transcriptional repressors have been shown to associate with hdacs  <cit> . to test whether the observed transcriptional repression by p <dig> and p <dig> was dependent on hdac activity, cat activity assays were performed as before, using the tk-cat and mlp-cat reporter plasmids, in the presence and absence of the hdac inhibitor trichostatin a . the relief of repression by tsa was then determined for p68-/p72-gal <dig> compared with that observed for the gal <dig> vector alone since tsa will also increase basal levels of transcription. no effect was observed with the tk-cat promoter . for the mlp-cat promoter repression was relieved two-fold in the case of p <dig> while no effect was seen with p <dig> . this is not surprising since p <dig> does not repress transcription from this promoter . these findings therefore suggest that hdac activity appears to be important for transcriptional repression of the mlp promoter by p <dig> and imply that repression of the tk-cat may employ a different mechanism  <cit> .

to examine further the involvement of hdacs in transcriptional repression by p68/p <dig> we determined whether p <dig> and/or p <dig> co-immunoprecipitate a hdac activity in cells. plasmids expressing myc-tagged p <dig> and p <dig> were expressed in  <dig> cells  and the tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using the myc epitope antibody, 9e <dig>  equal amounts of immunoprecipitated protein bound to the antibody, as confirmed by western blotting , were then used in an hdac activity assay  in the presence and absence of tsa. in this assay  p <dig> was found to co-immunoprecipitate a hdac activity, which is abolished by tsa, while p <dig> did not. these findings are consistent with p <dig> interacting with a hdac and repressing transcription in a hdac-dependent manner.

p <dig> and p <dig> associate with hdac <dig> in cells
three classes of hdacs have been described. class i hdacs, which include hdac <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  are expressed in the nucleus and have been shown to bind several transcription factors and to mediate transcriptional repression  <cit> . since hdac <dig> is the prototypical member  and has been well studied we decided to examine whether p <dig> and/or p <dig> associate with hdac <dig> in cells. we had previously shown that a large proportion of p <dig> and p <dig> co-elute by gel filtration  <cit> . therefore we examined fractions from a dnase/rnase-treated  <dig> cell lysate, which had been separated by gel filtration, by western blotting using antibodies against p <dig>  p <dig> and hdac <dig>  and showed that a significant proportion of hdac <dig> co-elutes with the majority of p <dig> and a substantial proportion of p <dig> in the cell in complexes that are of a size consistent with p68/p <dig> interacting with hdac <dig> . since co-elution does not, in itself, indicate an interaction, we went on to examine whether p <dig> and or p <dig> co-immunoprecipitate with hdac <dig> from cell lysates. for p <dig>  nuclear extracts were prepared from u2os cells and hdac <dig> was immunoprecipitated with an hdac1-specific antibody. immunopreciptiated proteins were then separated by sds-page and the presence of p <dig> was detected by western blotting with a p68-specific antibody . as currently available antibodies against p <dig> cross react with other nuclear proteins  <cit>   <dig> cells were transfected with myc-tagged p <dig> and interactions between the myc-tagged p <dig> and hdac <dig> were examined. in this case, therefore, nuclear extracts were prepared from transfected cells, hdac <dig> was immunoprecipitated as before and associated myc-tagged p <dig> was detected by western blotting using the myc epitope-specific antibody, 9e <dig> . in each case, the presence of hdac <dig> in the immunoprecipitate was confirmed by western blotting with the hdac1-specific antibody . as an additional control we carried out a reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiment in which nuclear extracts from  <dig> cells transfected with myc-tagged p68/p <dig> were prepared, the myc-tagged p68/p <dig> proteins were immunoprecipitated using the myc epitope-specific antibody and associated hdac <dig> was detected by western blotting using the hdac1-specific antibody . cells that had not been transfected were used as a control. additionally, since deletion derivatives encompassing residues 1– <dig> of p <dig> and 1– <dig> of p <dig> can repress transcription as well as the respective full-length proteins, we examined whether these deletions could co-immunoprecipitate with hdac <dig>  we therefore transfected  <dig> cells with gal4-tagged proteins containing residues 1– <dig> of p <dig> and 1– <dig> of p <dig>  prepared nuclear extracts, immunoprecipitated hdac <dig> and western blotted for associated gal4-tagged p68/p <dig> with a gal4-specific antibody. as shown in figure 7b, these deletion derivatives co-immunoprecipitate efficiently with hdac <dig>  suggesting that this region of p68/ <dig> interacts with hdac <dig>  these findings thus indicate that p <dig> and p <dig> associate with hdac <dig> in cells and that the interaction appears to be mediated by the regions which, in our system, are responsible for the transcriptional repression activity of p <dig> and p <dig>  moreover, since the immunoprecipitations were performed with extracts that had been treated with dnase/rnase , the interactions of p68/p <dig> and hdac <dig> are not mediated by nucleic acid.

discussion
we have shown that the highly related dead box rna helicases p <dig> and p <dig> act as repressors of transcription in a promoter-context manner. when targeted to the tk-cat promoter-reporter construct they both strongly repress transcription . furthermore, this transcriptional repression does not appear to be due to either squelching or physical blocking of the transcription apparatus , implying an active transcriptional mechanism. moreover repression of tk-cat was observed in several cell lines  suggesting that it is not cell line dependent. in order to determine whether this repression activity exhibited any promoter specificity we also tested the ability of p <dig> and p <dig> to repress transcription of other constitutively active promoter-reporter constructs with high basal levels of transcription, namely mlp-cat and sv40-cat. interestingly mlp-cat revealed a difference in the ability of p <dig> and p <dig> to repress transcription, with p <dig> strongly repressing transcription of this promoter-reporter and p <dig> having no effect . this observation suggests that, although highly homologous  p <dig> and p <dig> proteins may act differently in some contexts, perhaps through the association with different protein partners. neither p <dig> nor p <dig> repressed transcription of sv40-cat  suggesting that the repression by p <dig> and p <dig> is promoter context-dependent, an observation that has been reported for other transcription factors  <cit> . these findings thus are consistent with the observed repression activity of p68/p <dig> being an active process. interestingly, in this context, another dead box protein dp <dig>  has been found to act as a co-repressor of the ets repressor mets/pe <dig>  <cit> .

using a series of deletion derivatives of p <dig> and p <dig> we identified three domains, within the core conserved among the dead box family of proteins, which can independently repress transcription . moreover regions encompassing residues 1– <dig> of p <dig> and 1– <dig> of p <dig>  which contain the complete conserved core , can repress transcription as well as the respective full-length proteins . in contrast, the c-terminal extension of both proteins acts as a transcriptional activator in this context  consistent with earlier reports of these proteins acting as transcriptional co-activators  <cit> . thus, using this system, we have shown that there are separable transcriptional repression and activation domains within p <dig> and p <dig> 

since hdac proteins have been extensively implicated in the repression of transcription, it was important to examine whether these proteins are likely to play a role in transcriptional repression by p <dig> and/or p <dig>  firstly, the ability of the hdac inhibitor, tsa, to relieve repression was examined. no effect was observed on repression of tk-cat  implying the involvement of a hdac-independent mechanism in repression of the tk promoter. in contrast, repression of mlp-cat by p <dig> was relieved two-fold compared with the vector control  suggesting the involvement of hdacs in this process.  supporting these data, p <dig> was found to co-immunoprecipitate a hdac activity which was abolished by the addition of tsa, while p <dig> did not . we chose to investigate whether p <dig> and/or p <dig> associate with hdac <dig>  since it is a well-studied example of class i hdacs. both p <dig> and p <dig> co-immunoprecipitate with hdac <dig> ; furthermore hdac <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> co-elute in similar sized complexes by gel-filtration, which are of an appropriate size  supporting the idea of interactions between p68/p <dig> and hdac <dig> in cells. moreover, the finding that these proteins co-immunoprecipitate and co-elute from extracts which had been treated with dnase/rnase suggest that these represent protein-protein interactions rather than merely interactions via nucleic acid. while an interaction between hdac <dig> and p <dig> is not supported by the results of the hdac assay, or the tsa experiment, it is possible that, in some instances, p <dig> does recruit hdac <dig> and that this mechanism is not being triggered in the mlp-cat assay or hdac assay. alternatively, it is possible that the observed co-immunoprecipitation of p <dig> and hdac <dig> is occurring through the interaction between p <dig> and p <dig>  <cit>  or that hdac <dig> associated with p <dig> may have other, possibly non-transcriptional, roles  <cit> . however, the data are entirely consistent with p <dig> recruiting hdac <dig> to achieve active repression of transcription. future investigations should also reveal whether the differential ability of p <dig> and p <dig> to recruit active hdac proteins is responsible for the difference observed upon the mlp promoter.

our attempts at correlating the different repressive functions of p <dig> and p <dig> to specific domains of the respective proteins, using deletion derivatives, were unsuccessful, as the equivalent regions of both either caused transcriptional repression or activation. while this might suggest that both helicases repress transcription in the same manner, it is more likely that the hdac recruitment by p <dig> may be an additional mechanism of repression, used at specific promoters. we also cannot rule out the recruitment of other repression complexes at this stage. our findings that p <dig> and p <dig> differ in their ability to repress the mlp promoter and to recruit hdac activity suggest that, at least in some contexts, p <dig> and p <dig> repress transcription by different mechanisms.

in summary, it is clear that p <dig> and p <dig> act to repress transcription in a differential manner dependent upon promoter context. it will be important to determine which endogenous promoters are subject to repression by p68/p <dig> in a physiological context. however, until the signal transduction pathways, which target these proteins to the appropriate promoters, are elucidated it will be necessary to use a targeting system  to undertake a molecular analysis of transcriptional repression by p <dig> and p <dig>  since it is now clear that p68/p <dig> can act both to activate and repress transcription future work will involve dissection of the transcriptional activation/repression complexes in which p <dig> and p <dig> are involved, as well as characterisation of the molecular 'switch' which determines whether these proteins will be part of transcriptional activation or repression complexes.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that the highly related rna helicases p <dig> and p <dig> can repress transcription in a promoter context-dependent manner. both proteins associate with hdac <dig>  a well-established transcriptional repressor protein. strikingly, however, p <dig> and p <dig> behave differently in their ability to repress transcription from different promoters and in their ability to recruit hdac activity suggesting that they may, at least in some contexts, repress transcription by different mechanisms.
