BACKGROUND
the industrial oilseed crop crambe abyssincia  is a non-food oilseed crop from the brassicaceae family, which includes crops such as rapeseed  and mustard  <cit> . because crambe is a specific non-food crop, its production and processing chain has no overlap with the food production chain. as an oil crop, 33% to 39% of the whole crambe seed including the pod consists of oil of which 55% to 63% is erucic acid   <cit> . erucic acid and its derivative erucamide  <cit>  are widely used in industry and determine largely the high value of the crambe oil. its erucic acid content is higher than that in the oil of most other brassicaceae species, including high erucic acid rapeseed   <cit> . currently, the main production of erucic acid is still from hear, which might present, however, some potential risks. these potential risks reside in intermixing of industrial hear with low erucic acid rapeseed  which is used for edible oil. due to their intrinsic different utilities, cross-contamination between them must be strictly avoided, because it will not only decrease both their economical values , but it might also potentially threaten food security. the amount of erucic acid allowed in food oil has to be lower than 5% . to avoid such problems, crambe has been considered to replace hear, because it cannot cross with brassica napus or b. campestris  and only very rarely with b. juncea   <cit> . however, the major obstacle for this replacement is that crambe has much lower yields than rapeseed, and hence economically cannot compete with hear. addressing this disadvantage of crambe, the european union funded the 7th frame work project ‘industrial crops producing added value oil for novel chemicals’  which was planned to overcome the constraints by raising its erucic acid content through genetic modification . higher erucic acid contents can reduce the total production costs including downstream processing of erucic acid, and accordingly increase profits. furthermore, another target of icon was to change not only levels but also the composition of crambe oil by gm  <cit> .

the establishment of agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated genetic modification   <cit>  in plants has changed plant science studies remarkably. it brought new strategies and methods to molecular breeding as part of modern crop breeding research. after the first gm crop, the flavr savr™ tomato, which carried an artificial antisense gene copy targeted against polygalacturonase in order to prevent premature fruit softening, was put on the market in the usa in  <dig>  <cit> , other gm crops have been commercialized around the world in the past 20 years. in  <dig> the area of gm crop cultivation was around  <dig> million hectares  <cit> . however, in spite of this success, there are still many regions in the world, e.g. the european union, where the policies against gm food crops are very strict. there has been a concern of gm crops threatening people’s health and the ecosystem, which cannot be ignored. therefore, worldwide acceptance of gm food is far from being a reality. gm crops for industrial feedstock production, such as crambe, might be more easily accepted by consumers.

to achieve the goals of icon mentioned above, it is important to have efficient transformation and in vitro regeneration/propagation protocols available for crambe. here, we describe the development of a series of protocols for all steps that are required in the process to obtain gm crambe. it includes in vitro tissue regeneration, micro-propagation, selection and agrobacterium-mediated transformation.

RESULTS
shoot regeneration from seedling explants
table  <dig> shows callus formation and direct shoot regeneration  and indirect shoot regeneration  of cotyledon explants  with different hormone combinations and gelling agents after four weeks of culture. although cotyledons formed callus on all hormone combinations in media solidified with microagar, no shoot regeneration occurred after seven weeks of culture with one exception, while the explants on phytoblend-solidified media did show shoot regeneration. the shoot regeneration of cotyledons mostly took place indirectly from the callus. dsr happened only on phytoblend medium with  <dig>  μm naa and  <dig>  μm bap at a low percentage. the percentage of indirect shoot regeneration from callus generally decreased with increasing bap concentrations. the results of two-way anova statistical analyses showed that 1) the explants on phytoblend medium gave significantly  more isr than those on microagar medium; 2) among the media with phytoblend, the bap concentration significantly influenced the isr , but the naa did not; 3) neither gelling agent nor hormones had an effect on the dsr.table  <dig>

cotyledon, cotyledonary node and hypocotyl explants from a 7-day-old crambe seedling. the parts of the seedling marked a, b and c are cotyledons, cotyledonary nodes and hypocotyls respectively. when cutting the cotyledonary node explants, extra care is taken to remove the apical bud.



in comparison with cotyledons, the cotyledonary node explants  gave less callus and isr but more dsr, varying from 23% to 98% on medium with microagar. with phytoblend as gelling agent, the explants gave extremely high levels of dsr among all treatments and the efficiencies ranged from 50% to 100%. the combination of  <dig>  μm naa with phytoblend showed more isr than the other combinations. the phytoblend medium with  <dig>  μm naa and  <dig>  μm bap had explants with 100% dsr and 15% isr, which was the best. in the phytoblend media, the frequency of isr decreased when bap and naa concentrations were increased. according to the two-way anova analyses, the conclusions are 1) in the microagar media, the naa concentration influenced the dsr and isr significantly, negative for dsr but positive for isr; 2) in the phytoblend medium, neither naa nor bap influenced the direct shoot-regeneration; 3) within phytoblend media, the naa concentration significantly affected the isr .table  <dig>

hypocotyl explants  also showed a lot of callus formation on media with microagar plus  <dig>  μm naa, varying from 93% to 100%; fewer calli were formed on media with 5 μm naa. dsr and isr were rarely observed on the media with microagar, 2% dsr on  <dig>  μm naa +  <dig>  μm bap and 2% isr on  <dig>  μm naa +  <dig>  μm bap and on 5 μm naa +  <dig>  μm bap. using phytoblend, less callus induction was observed on  <dig>  μm naa than on  <dig>  or 5 μm naa. dsr occurred only on medium with  <dig>  μm naa and 22 μm bap at 3%. isr was found at 3% on the combinations  <dig>  μm naa +  <dig>  μm bap,  <dig>  μm naa +  <dig>  or  <dig>  μm bap. according to the result of two-way anova analyses, neither gelling agent nor hormone had a significant effect on dsr or isr.

in summary, according to the results above, the optimal medium for crambe shoot-regeneration contains a hormone-combination of  <dig>  μm naa and  <dig>  μm bap using phytoblend as gelling agent , using as a standard full ms, with 20 g · l- <dig> sucrose and 2 mg · l- <dig> agno <dig>  cotyledons had the highest isr frequency, and cotyledonary nodes had the highest dsr frequency and moderate isr, while explants from hypocotyls showed very limited dsr and isr.

shoot forming capacity of explant types from in vitro grown plants
in vitro multiplication of shoots is important for acquiring and maintaining homogeneous starting material for experiments or for clonal propagation of generated gm lines. here both de novo adventitious shoots formation as well as outgrowth of existing meristems were considered. the results of testing the shoot forming capacity of explants derived from established in vitro seedlings are shown in figure  <dig> in which the direct and indirect shoot regeneration numbers were counted together. in vitro leaf parts gave no shoot formation at all on the pre-selected regeneration medium, but only callus. the petioles had a very limited shoot forming capacity of  <dig> %. stem explants showed a moderate frequency of shoot generation at 30%, which was all indirectly from callus and only the explants of axillary buds reached a high level of shoot proliferation. after two weeks, 70% of the cultured axillary bud explants  showed shoot formation, which was mostly direct. after five weeks, a shoot formation percentage of 95% was observed; regeneration was both direct  and indirect . the amount of regenerating shoots from an individual axillary bud explant varied widely from  <dig> to more than  <dig>  while on average one explant yielded  <dig> regenerating shoots. in this whole procedure, axillary buds always gave the highest shoot multiplication rate .figure  <dig>

testing selection for transformants
the results of testing kanamycin treatments on wild-type  crambe seedling explants from cv. ‘galactica’ are shown in additional file  <dig>  the controls, growing on medium without kanamycin for four weeks, showed vigorous growth and callus and shoot development for all three explant types tested. on medium with 10 mg · l- <dig> kanamycin, the number of surviving explants  already was significantly lower compared to the controls, as well as the callus formation and shoot regeneration, but still some explants with green regenerating shoot clusters were left. kanamycin at a concentration of  <dig> and 50 mg · l- <dig>  completely inhibited shoot regeneration from all types of explants.

transformation
as displayed in table  <dig>  cotyledons and cotyledonary node explants, with two methods of selection  and two hormone combinations  were used for transformation, and the explants were tested for gus activity after eight weeks of selection after agrobacterium inoculation. gus-positive shoots were detected on cotyledonary nodes on both media with shifting selection; only one explant produced gus + shoots using the consistent selection scheme. the highest numbers of shoots showing gus staining and being pcr positive  came from explants on medium a with shifting selection. for cotyledons, gus-positive shoots were only obtained from explants on media a, and shifting selection showed a higher frequency than the consistent selection. summarizing, within these combinations, the highest percentage of gus positive shoots was 10% for cotyledonary nodes from medium a with shifting selection, more gus-positive shoots were observed with the shifting selection method compared to consistent selection and explants on medium a gave higher rates of transformation for both cotyledonary nodes and cotyledons. lastly, cotyledonary nodes gave more positive shoots then cotyledons. it was found that not all plants that survived kanamycin selection for eight weeks proved to be gus positive.table  <dig>

transformation of axillary bud explants
axillary buds of in vitro grown plants could potentially be used as explants for inoculation. to test their suitability some preliminary transformation experiments were done in which different vectors were used as well as different selection schemes. the numbers of surviving, green shoots were scored after  <dig> to 30 weeks of selection, which were subsequently screened for gus activity or dsred fluorescence. the results are summarized in table  <dig>  transformation events were obtained, however, at lower frequencies when compared to cotyledonary node explants. the highest frequency of transformed shoots  was obtained when the kanamycin shifting selection method with 10 mg · l- <dig> two weeks, followed by 20 mg · l- <dig> for four weeks, and then back to 10 mg · l- <dig> was used. the experiment with a slightly higher kanamycin concentration in the second period  yielded a low transformation rate of  <dig> %. consistent selection with 10 mg · l- <dig> required a longer selection period of 30 weeks. a regenerated transgenic shoot from the transformation with pbinglyred  is shown in figure 3d . all putative transgenic shoots were confirmed by pcr for the presence of nptii gene.table  <dig>

discussion
in the present research, a series of protocols for crambe in vitro regeneration, selection and transformation are described. the research presented here showed that the most efficient regeneration was obtained from cotyledonary nodes isolated from seedlings and axillary buds taken from in vitro grown plantlets as explant types. a combination of the plant growth regulators naa  and bap  was shown to be optimal in standard ms <dig> . furthermore, the gelling agent used was found to play an important role in determining regeneration efficiency, with phytoblend performing better than microagar. comparing the regeneration efficiencies from hypocotyls to the ones obtained in this study from axillary buds and cotyledonary nodes, the latter were higher, however, the mode of regeneration might be different. cotyledonary nodes and axillary buds contain meristematic tissue. this might explain why they showed more direct shoot regeneration than other explant types . meristem outgrowth, especially regeneration from axillary buds is a useful tool for in vitro plant propagation  <cit> . in vitro propagation can be extremely useful in multiplying any putative transgenic crambe events, generating sufficient clonal material for either dna isolation or rooting and transfer of t <dig> lines into the greenhouse. cloned individuals can be subjected to further antibiotic selection, thereby decreasing the chance of getting escapes or chimeras. the latter is important because explant types containing meristematic tissue are considered prone to producing chimeric plants. in our experiments, the clonally propagated putative transgenic lines were subjected to renewed selection on 10 mg · l- <dig> kanamycin for approximately three weeks, and when the entire clone stayed green , the candidate was considered transgenic. if some parts bleached, it meant that the original shoot was either an escape or a chimera, for which longer selection was needed. however, prolonging the selection period does not guarantee elimination of all chimeric tissue. to exclude totally any chance of working with chimeric plants, going through a seed phase is considered to be essential in order to get stable, homogeneous transgenic crambe plant lines. two protocols of crambe transformation have been reported earlier, one by  <cit>  based on hygromycin selection , and another by  <cit>  based on kanamycin selection . both used hypocotyls as explants, which in our hands yielded very low transformation efficiencies. t-dna insert copy numbers seemed to be higher using hypocotyls. for efficient plant transformation protocols, the choice of the proper selection agent and the optimal concentration to use is crucial. we tested killing curves of kanamycin for cotyledonary node explants and determined the concentration at which regeneration would be totally abolished, preferably without complete killing of the original explant. we also showed the effect of different exposure schemes, varying from a specific concentration continuously throughout the entire selection to shifting from one concentration to another higher one later and back to the original concentration again. the results indicated that the shifting treatments gave better results for transformation efficiency than a consistent one in case of kanamycin selection. the shift in concentrations originated from the earlier observation, that in wild type material 10 mg · l- <dig> kanamycin still allowed escapes up to a level of 17% after four weeks , while the consistently high selective pressure of 25 mg · l- <dig> kanamycin proved too harsh as only a very limited number of transformants could be obtained in this way. dying untransformed cells might negatively influence the viability of transformed cells hampering regeneration. on the other hand at lower concentrations, untransformed cells might benefit from the detoxifying capabilities of transformed cells and survive selection giving rise to escapes or perhaps chimeras. our research showed that the frequency of escapes at a concentration of 10 mg · l- <dig> was much higher for hypocotyl explants  than for the other explant types tested . this could suggest that the tolerance level of hypocotyls to kanamycin was higher than that of other explants. li et al.  <cit>  developed a protocol for crambe transformation based on hypocotyl explants, using 25 mg · l- <dig> kanamycin selection and obtained a transformation frequency between 1% to 3%. hence, consistent selection at 25 mg · l- <dig> could be suited for selection in hypocotyls, but not for selection in cotyledons and cotyledonary nodes.

in our transformation experiments, using kanamycin selection and cotyledonary node explants, the transformation frequencies varied from  <dig> to 10% with an average of  <dig> % with respect to the efficiency . previously, similar cotyledonary node-based protocols have also been used in transformation of sugar beet  <cit>  and caraway  <cit> . in caraway, the cotyledonary-node transformation method yielded confirmed transformants through a seemingly direct shoot regeneration process. on the other hand for sugar beet, no transformed shoots were obtained from the first series of direct regenerants, but only from later series with or without visible signs of dedifferentiation. in this research, similar to sugar beet, we never found any gus positive transformants among the directly regenerating shoots from cotyledonary nodes. all the gus positive and dsred fluorescing shoots were obtained later after the first, directly regenerating shoots had been removed. during the process of cotyledonary node transformation and regeneration, we observed that all the callus and indirect regenerating shoots were formed in the region around the original meristematic zone, while directly regenerating shoots emerged from this zone itself. this might suggest that the actively growing meristem cells can influence surrounding cells inducing them to differentiate into developing shoots. gus staining and dsred fluorescence shortly after co-cultivation demonstrated that some areas on the cotyledonary node explants showed evidence of gene transfer  but not the meristematic zones. therefore, we believe that the transformed shoots were mostly derived through indirect regeneration, thereby reducing the chance of finding chimeras. crucial in this phenomenon is whether the regeneration comes form a single cell or from a cluster of multiple cells. the latter cannot be excluded. although cotyledons gave more indirect shoot regeneration from primary formed callus, there were just too few transgenic events leading to the generation of transgenic shoots. accordingly, the cotyledonary-node method was chosen as the main protocol for the transformation of crambe. meristematic tissues have also been used for sunflower  <cit> , cotton  <cit>  and soybean  <cit>  transformation.

the new protocol developed here was applied for transformation with several different vectors. no correlation could be found between vector traits such as size or origin and the transformation frequency, nor was any difference observed between the two agrobacterium strains used . finally, with all vectors used we found t-dna insert copy numbers ranging from one single copy to more than six  copies. the chance of acquiring multiple t-dna insertion lines  was similar to getting single copy-insertion lines .

although transformation of axillary buds from in vitro grown plants showed low efficiencies compared to the cotyledonary nodes, this method might serve as a more convenient alternative method for retransformation using different selection agents or retransformation after generating marker-free plants when seeds for preparing cotyledonary nodes are not yet available. however, further improvements are still needed to make it into a stable and reliable method.

CONCLUSIONS
present research revealed the possibility of using crambe meristem tissue from seedling or in vitro plant, for genetic transformation and in vitro propagation. the most efficient method of transformation was based on cotyledonary node explants from 7-days-old seedlings with a shifting kanamycin selection , and it indicated the frequency varied from 1% to 10%. moreover, in comparison with other kinds of tissue, the meristem tissue  had the highest ability for shoot proliferation. according to the experience from performing the transformation protocol with six different vectors and two kinds of agrobacterium strains, the average frequency was  <dig> % with a term as long as 20 weeks. the result of t <dig> plant t-dna insertion number determination by southern blotting showed that, there was a 50/50% chance of having single -or multi-insertion lines.
