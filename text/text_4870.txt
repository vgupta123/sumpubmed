BACKGROUND
the genus bacillus consists of a heterogeneous group of gram-positive heterotrophic aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacilli with the ability to form environmentally resistant, metabolically inert spores  <cit> . these soil-borne organisms are ubiquitous throughout the world, and occupy surprisingly diverse environments  <cit> . within this large genus, the b. cereus sensu lato group consists of six species , based on classical microbial taxonomy  <cit> . however, newer molecular phylogenies and comparative genome sequencing suggests that these organisms should be classified as a single species  <cit> . on the surface, this conclusion seems difficult to reconcile with the varied biological characteristics of these organisms. some bc strains are thermophiles  <cit> , while b. weihenstephanensis is psychrophilic  <cit> . by contrast, many members of this group are mesophiles, and can be found in a variety of locales including soil, on plant surfaces and in the mammalian gastrointestinal microflora  <cit> . some members of this group appear to be nonpathogenic, while others cause diverse diseases including gastroenteritis, food poisoning  <cit> , endophthalmitis  <cit> , tissue abscesses  <cit> , and anthrax  <cit> . bt strains have the capacity to cause disease in insects  <cit>  and possibly nematodes  <cit> , while some evidence suggests that bc strains are part of the normal insect gut flora  <cit> . nevertheless, whole genome comparisons between these organisms reveal a surprising similarity in gene content, and han et al.  <cit>  have concluded "that differential regulation  modulates virulence rather than simple acquisition of virulence factor genes", a conclusion confirmed by other studies  <cit> . consequently, we will refer to these organisms as the bc species-group, to reflect the extremely close phylogenetic relationships between these organisms.

how do we account for the underlying genomic similarity of these phenotypically diverse microbes? it has been established for some time that the most rapidly evolving and evolutionarily flexible portions of the bacterial genome are regulatory sequences and transcriptional networks  <cit> . thus, it is no surprise that major differences between bc species-group organisms reside in the regulation of gene expression rather than gene content. a prime example of this divergence is the plcr-papr quorum-sensing operon, present in all bc species-group organisms, but harboring point mutations that differentiate group members from one another  <cit> . the papr locus encodes a quorum-sensing signal  that is internalized and binds to plcr, a transcriptional activator that controls gene expression and is important for bc virulence. there are four distinct phylogenetic groups of the papr peptide, each with point mutations that result in a unique quorum-sensing 'pherotype'  <cit> . the plcr sensor in each pherotype has co-evolved to exclusively bind only its cognate papr peptide, and each plcr pherotype is consequently 'blind' to the quorum sensing signals secreted by other bc pherotypes. ba strains   <cit>  have taken plcr-papr divergence a step further. these organisms carry a unique nonsense mutation in plcr that inactivates the quorum-sensing function entirely. since plcr and the global virulence regulator atxa on the virulence plasmid pxo <dig> appear to antagonize one another  <cit> , plcr inactivation after ba acquired pxo <dig> appears necessary for full virulence of ba.

this is not to say that horizontal gene transfer and genome reduction have not been important in remodeling genomes within the bc species-group. for instance, the virulence plasmids pxo <dig> and pxo <dig> in ba appear to have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer  <cit> , and represent 52% of the unique coding capacity found in the ba genome. although these genes have a significant impact on the ba pathogenic phenotype, this plasmid gene content comprises only  <dig> genes, representing a small fraction of the total coding capacity of the ba genome. genome reduction has played a modest role in divergence of the bc species-group  <cit> , likely being responsible for the reduced genome size of bc nvh391- <dig>  however, genome reduction is probably more important for speciation events; e.g., the m. leprae genome is fully 26% smaller than that of m. tuberculosis, and carries over  <dig> pseudogenes with functional orthologs in m. tuberculosis. gr has essentially eliminated 50% of the coding capacity of the m. leprae genome  <cit> . thus, subtler genome alterations within the bc species-group, such as gene duplication, divergence and point mutations probably have contributed as much or more than horizontal gene transfer and genome reduction to the unique niche adaptations of individuals within the bc species-group.

anderson et al.  <cit>  first noted that the genomes of bc species-group organisms appeared to harbor an overabundance of sigma factors, compared to b. subtilis strain  <dig>  bacterial sigma factors bind rna polymerase and allow the holoenzyme to recognize promoter sequences 5' to the site of initiation of transcription  <cit> . typically, bacteria encode several different sigma factors, each of which is responsible for controlling a suite of genes by activating transcription at a unique set of sigma factor specific promoter sequences. sigma factors generally belong to two primary categories, the sigma <dig> and the sigma <dig> families  <cit> . the sigma <dig> proteins encoded by the bc species-group are very highly conserved, and ubiquitously present as a single copy gene. therefore, a phylogenetic analysis of these proteins in the bc species-group was not particularly revealing . we consequently focused further efforts on the sigma <dig> proteins. sigma <dig> proteins can be further differentiated into primary alternative  sigma factors and extracytoplasmic function sigma factors   <cit> . in general, pa sigma factors control expression of many housekeeping functions of the cell , and allow the organism to respond to specific environmental stimuli such as heat-shock   <cit> ; in b. subtilis, several pa sigma factors are integral to the sporulation developmental pathway  <cit> . ecf sigma factors typically activate gene expression in response to extracellular signals such as the availability of specific iron sources  <cit>  and commonly are essential for disease pathogenesis  <cit> . the activity of a pa or  an ecf sigma is often controlled by an anti-sigma factor that renders the sigma factor in a state unable to bind rna polymerase. activation of the sigma factor for rna polymerase binding and transcription initiation is triggered by a signal  that inactivates the anti-sigma factor  <cit> .

thus, sigma factors activate transcription in response to environmental or developmental signals, and selectively activate transcription by recognizing different consensus promoter sequences to tailor gene expression to those signals  <cit> . this suggested to us that many of the phenotypic differences between members of the bc species-group organisms might be a consequence of the sigma factor gene expansion  <cit> , accompanied by divergence among the sigma factor regulons of these organisms. consequently, we began to explore the phylogeny of the sigma factors found in various bc species-group members, by comparison to the experimentally well-understood model organism b. subtilis. to place these studies in context, we began by constructing a phylogeny of the bacillaceae using whole-genome single copy genes. this phylogeny suggested that the current taxonomic affiliation of many members of the bacillaceae should be reconsidered. using this phylogeny as a basis, we then examined the phylogenetic relationships of the sigma factors encoded by members of the bc species-group. we find that the overabundance of sigma factors encoded by the bc species-group organisms is specifically in the ecf sigma factors, rather than in the sigma factor group as a whole. the sigma factor gene family encoded by the bc species-group is the end-product of a dynamic gene-duplication and gene-loss process that has, until now, underestimated the true heterogeneity of ecf sigma factor content in the bc species-group. further, the sigma factor content carried by any given member of the bc species-group suggests that both shared and unique gene expression patterns have evolved during the divergence of this group of organisms from a common ancestor.

RESULTS
whole-genome single copy-gene phylogeny of the family bacillaceae

phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> single copy genes  of  <dig> bacillaceae genomes , using paenibacillus and brevibacillus as outgroups, indicate that there are five main lineages and suggest four modifications to the taxonomy of the family . the initial divergence within the bacillaceae was between exiguobacterium, an aerobic, asporogenous, and irregularly shaped gram-positive bacterium recently linked to bacteraemia  <cit> , and the bulk of the family. subsequent to this, b. halodurans, b. clausii, b. selenitireducens, and b. pseudofirmus  diverged from the rest of the family, followed by the divergence of oceanobacillus and lysinibacillus. within the remaining bacillus genera, there is a multichotomous split between the b. subtilis group , the bc species-group, b. megaterium, and a group that includes strains of geobacillus and anoxybacillus . although results from the maximum likelihood analysis indicate a lack of resolution between these four groups, the inclusion of geobacillus and anoxybacillus within bacillus has strong support . this indicates that oceanobacillus, lysinibacillus, geobacillus, and anoxybacillus are more closely related to some bacillus spp. than are members of the b. halodurans group, and that, if one wishes the taxonomy of the group to reflect evolutionary history, should be subsumed within bacillus.

these relationships are significantly different than those deduced by most other strategies, until recently. the family bacillaceae, including the genus bacillus, is a heterogeneous collection of gram-positive rod-shaped bacteria within the firmicutes and includes both free-living and pathogenic species with a world-wide distribution. their heterogeneity is reflected in a highly variable gc content ranging between  <dig> and 78% g+c. to date, the most commonly utilized phylogenetic strategy for examining these phylogenetic relationships has utilized rdna sequences. xu and cote  <cit> , for example, identified  <dig> groups within bacillaceae on the basis of 16s-23s internal transcribed spacer sequences. seven of those groups included members of the genus bacillus. the ribosomal database project   <cit>  currently includes  <dig>  sequences for members of bacillaceae . however, recent study of relationships of members of bacillus has begun to look beyond 16s rdna sequences and has benefitted from the many whole-genome sequences becoming available. for example, alcaraz et al.  <cit>  examined twenty bacillus genomes and, utilizing a core-genome conceptual data analysis, determined the phylogeny of known bacillus spp. included in their study and identified four main lineages. although their study employed different outgroups, methods, and genomes sampled, their conclusions were similar to ours and consistent with the idea that the taxonomic affiliation of these organisms needs to be reconsidered, in the light of whole-genome analyses. this is not to suggest that phylogenetic analyses based on 16s rdna sequence should be supplanted by whole genome analyses, due to the obvious practical limitations of requiring the entire genome sequence of an isolate prior to phylogenetic analysis. however, whole genome phylogenetic methods such as that presented here, and by other groups such as alcaraz et al.  <cit>  indicate that the resolution of 16s phylogenies should be viewed with caution. our results also are consistent with the conclusions of tourasse et al.  <cit> , who have recently described an extremely robust analysis of this group of organisms using a combination of mslt, aflp and mlee genotyping. again, these methodologies have the advantage of not requiring whole genome sequence for analysis. nevertheless, the comprehensive nature of using whole genome sequences for phylogenetic comparisons is attractive due to the power of the technique, when the data is available.

within the bc species-group , bc subsp. cytotoxis nvh 391- <dig> is the most distantly related of the bc species-group, followed by b. weihenstephanensis. the remaining bc strains form a paraphyletic assemblage that excludes b. thuringiensis and b. anthracis. while both the gene content and extent of divergence suggest that bc subsp. cytotoxis and perhaps b. weihenstephanensis may warrant specific recognition, other organisms within the bc species-group do not. for example, the three bt strains did not group together. bt konkukian is most closely related to ba, while the other two bt strains are more distantly related. the closest relative of bt al hakam is bc 03bb <dig>  while bt strain bmb <dig> is mostly nearly related to bc strain atcc <dig>  preliminary results for two other bt strains, kurstaki t03a <dig> and hd <dig>  also fall within this region of the phylogeny . ba strains form a monophyletic lineage and could be a sub-species of bc. while subsuming ba and bt within bc may be problematic, there are definitively bc strains  that are significantly more closely related to ba or bt than they are to other strains of bc. thus, our phylogenetic assessment is consistent with other recent suggestions that the bc group exhibits sufficiently high genetic similarity that these organisms could be members of a single species .

initial dataset containing the bc species-group sigma factors
iterative blast searches initiated from  <dig> b. subtilis sigma factors initially identified  <dig> potential sigma factors within the  <dig> strains of bc species-group genomes . a total of  <dig> genes identified in the iterative blast searches were excluded from the final analysis due to either their short length , and/or lack of evidence from the multiple expectation maximization for motif elicitation  analysis warranting their inclusion as a sigma factor . tblastn searches to the nucleotide sequences of the bc species-group identified  <dig> additional non-annotated sigma factors that are orthologs of bsu <dig> , and bas <dig> and bas <dig> , respectively.

the seven most informative motifs from meme analysis proved useful in segregating functional sigma factors from sequences that bore superficial similarity to sigma factors , and allowed us to differentiate pa sigma factors from ecf sigma factors . comparing these meme motifs to previously identified regions of sequence conservation among sigma factors  <cit>  also was informative. motifs  <dig> and  <dig>  which are located near or slightly to the n-terminal side of the - <dig> and - <dig> promoter binding sites , respectively, were present in most sigma factors. meme motifs  <dig> and  <dig> also were identified within region  <dig> , and differentiate pa from ecf sigma factors. meme motifs  <dig> and  <dig> are at the - <dig> binding site and are also representative of pa and ecf sigma factors, respectively. meme motif  <dig>  lying to the n-terminal region of the - <dig> binding site, is largely restricted to pa sigma factors but is also present in  <dig> ecf sigma factor paralogs. aside from the well-documented differences in size between ecf and pa sigma factors, these data suggest that the principle functional difference between the two is directly associated with the binding of the protein to dna recognition sites.

sigma factor genes in the bacillaceae
taken as a whole, the number of pa sigma factor genes found within the genomes of the bacillaceae was roughly independent of the genome sizes of these organisms . by contrast, the numbers of ecf sigma factor genes found in the bacillaceae increased in direct proportion to genome size. thus, the overabundance of sigma factor genes earlier observed in the bc species-group organisms  <cit>  resulted from a preferential expansion in the ecf sigma factors, compared to the pa sigma factor genes. this might indicate that members of the bc species-group have evolved a more sophisticated ability to sense and respond transcriptionally to extracellular signals, compared to other members of the bacillaceae with smaller genomes and a relative paucity of ecf sigma factor genes. alternatively, this may indicate that other regulatory regimes  are preferentially used by members of the bacillaceae with smaller genomes, for coordinating transcription with extracellular signals. further work is necessary to differentiate between these possibilities.

phylogenetic analysis of the bc species-group sigma factors
within the bc species-group, phylogenetic analysis of the sigma factors of the bc species-group identified  <dig> paralogous sigma factor genes in these organisms . any one genome contained at most  <dig> sigma factor genes, hinting at an extensive history of gene duplication and loss in these lineages. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> were pa sigma factors and  <dig> were ecf sigma factors. four of the pa sigma factors genes and  <dig> ecf sigma factor genes were unique to the bc species-group, indicating that the majority of sigma factor gene expansion within the bc species-group is concentrated on the ecf sigma factor genes, as noted above. by comparison,  <dig> sigma factor genes were found for b. subtilis,  <dig> of which were pa sigma factors. the bc species-group harbors  <dig> pa sigma factors that are orthologous to the more extensively studied sigma factors of b. subtilis and appear to be the most evolutionarily conserved. . at least one of these pa sigma factors, bas <dig>  the ortholog of the b. subtilis sigh locus, is evolutionarily conserved amongst many of the firmicutes  <cit> . further, the location of these conserved pa sigma factors within their respective genomes was syntenic between genomes. indeed, finding a pa sigma factor that was not present in all members of the bc species-group was rare . one b. subtilis pa sigma factor, bsu <dig> , lacked an orthologous sequence in all members of the bc species-group. a second pa sigma factor, bsu <dig> , was uniformly found in all ba strains but only in one other bc strain  and in b. weiheinstephanensis. two  were absent in bc subsp. cytotoxis. in rare cases , a few pas appear to be the result of horizontal gene transfer from organisms outside of the bc species-group. however these are the only data that we found indicative of horizontal transfer, suggesting indirectly that horizontal gene transfer has not been a significant contributor to sigma factor evolution in these organisms.

a '+' designates the presence of a pa sigma factor ortholog group. the pa locus tag shown is from b. anthracis strain sterne, unless this gene was not found in that organism. in those instances another locus tag was chosen as a representative. genome abbreviations are as in table  <dig> 

the pattern of ecf sigma factor distribution was decidedly different and more complex. of the  <dig> ecf sigma factors found in b. subtilis,  <dig> were not present in the bc species-group. thus, the divergence of the bc species-group from b. subtilis resulted in a relatively stable set of pa sigma factor genes shared by both, with a regimen of gene expansion that resulted in additional ecf sigma factors encoded in the genomes of the bc species-group. interestingly, our analyses suggest that this pattern of expansion of ecf sigma factor genes within a given lineage may independently occur in another lineage of bacillales. our initial screen of sigma factors identified  <dig> sigma factors encoded in brevibacillus brevis  <cit> . of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> are ecf sigma factors. the b. brevis ecf sigma factor gene family may therefore represent an independent and dramatic expansion, comparing whole-genome phylogenetic analysis  and the absence of sequence similarity of the b. brevis ecf sigma factors to those of the bc species-group .

in contrast to the relative conservation of the pa sigma factors, the patterns of gene duplication/loss among paralogous ecf sigma factors of the bc species-group were difficult to deduce . no clear syntenic pattern was observed when comparing the location of these ecfs in the various genomes. neighbor-joining  analysis  indicates some support for relationships between four groups of bc species-group ecf sigma factors, including: 1) bas <dig> and bas <dig> , 2) a grouping of three paralogs including bas <dig> and bcerkbab4- <dig>  followed by bas <dig> , 3) bas <dig> and bas <dig>  bas <dig> and bcerkbab4- <dig> . however, evidence of more recent common ancestry between any pair of sigma factor paralogs is the exception rather than the rule. the remaining  <dig> bc species-group ecf sigma factor genes are of indeterminate relation to one another, and the preponderance of evidence seems to point to an active period of ecf sigma factor duplications in the ancestors of the bc species-group. however, the evolutionary origin of many of the ecf sigma factors in the bc species-group is difficult to discern, as the phylogenetic placement of these genes was more complex than for pa sigma factors. while it was relatively unusual to find pa sigma factors that were only encoded in some genomes, the pattern of ecf sigma factor genes harbored by some but not all bc species-group organisms was complex .

CONCLUSIONS
the preponderance of evidence presented here and elsewhere is that the ecf sigma factors of the bc species-group have common ancestry with one another and they are the product of gene duplications, although at this time the bulk of that evidence is raw sequence similarity. our hypothesis is that many of the ancestors of these genes regulated a larger sub-set of genes than their descendents do presently. following duplication, each cognate descendent sigma factor was then free to specialize  for a smaller subset of genes and for a more specialized role, and in the process of evolving into this specialized niche these genes then become critically important in the survival of descendent generations and are retained in their respective genomes. this subfunctionalization  <cit>  of gene regulation also is potentially reinforced by duplication and/or specialization of the genes which they regulate, which are likewise free from constraints that arise from being co-regulated with a larger set of genes. interestingly, this suggests that, although our ability to discern relationships among paralogous ecf sigma factors at this time is, at best, murky, in the future these relationships may be deduced from genes that each sigma factor is found to regulate.
