BACKGROUND
the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth is an important developmental process in plants, and flowering time is controlled by the merger of complex networks including the photoperiod, vernalization, gibberellin, autonomy, and age pathway  <cit> . these regulatory networks respond to endogenous cues and the external environment to maximize reproduction, thus flowering time is also an important agronomic trait in crop plants. these organisms constantly monitor environmental signals such as photoperiod, in particular, which is a primary signal, to adjust the timing of the floral transition. in arabidopsis, the photoperiodic flowering pathway mainly comprises the gigantea , constans , and flowering locus t  genes, and this gi-co-ft model is conserved in many plants . the gi protein, unique to plants, is a nuclear protein that acts upstream of the photoperiod pathway at a junction between the circadian-clock and the flowering time pathway  <cit> . gi can then induce co and ft expression by an interaction with the flavin-binding, kelch repeat, f-box  <dig>  protein in a co-dependent manner  <cit> . in addition, gi can directly or indirectly regulate ft expression in co-independent manner by binding to ft promoter regions or by interacting with ft repressors  <cit> .

flowering time is a domestication trait in various crops to which many genes have been attributed and characterized. the vernalization  and photoperiod  genes participated in the domestication and adaptation of wheat and barley  <cit> . heading date <dig> , an ortholog of arabidopsis constans, possibly underwent human selection to diversify the flowering time of rice during domestication or in early cultivation  <cit> . additionally, the flowering locus t/terminal flower  <dig>  gene family underwent selective sweeps during the evolution of cultivated sunflower   <cit> . zmcct  is involved in photoperiod sensitivity and could accelerate the spread of maize post-domestication  <cit> . gi homologs have been characterized with functional diversification in photoperiod flowering in several crops. it acts as a floral activator in pisum sativum , triticum aestivum  and hordeum vulgare  , whereas it functions as a floral repressor in oryza sativa  and soybean  .

soybean is an important source of protein and edible oil for humans. cultivated soybean  is thought to have been domesticated from wild soybean , which was distributed in china as early as 5000– <dig> years ago . during the process of soybean domestication many phenotypic changes were observed in the seed size, shattering, flowering time, growth habit and plant architecture, leading to high grain yield and wide cultivation  <cit> . using genetic populations derived from crosses between wild and cultivated soybeans, potential target loci have been connected to soybean domestication  <cit> . soybean whole genome sequencing further suggested that many genes are involved in soybean domestication . however, only three domesticated genes have been functionally characterized and are involved in pod shattering, seed hardness, and determinate growth in soybeans .

both wild and cultivated soybeans are generally short-day plants and are sensitive to photoperiods, although a few photoperiod-insensitive accessions were isolated in cultivars  <cit> . moreover, cultivated soybeans usually flower earlier than their wild counterparts , indicating that early flowering is favored during soybean domestication, yet the genetic variation causing this difference are poorly known. eight early maturity  loci, designed as e <dig> to e <dig>  have been demonstrated to be involved in soybean maturity  <cit> . e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> are involved in soybean adaptation to different latitudes  <cit> . of which, e <dig> encodes a gi homolog, a putative floral repressor  <cit> . the soybean genome contains three gi homologs  <cit> , but only gia plays a role in maturity and flowering in soybean  <cit> , and interestingly appears to be under selection  <cit> . whether this genetic variation of gia is involved in the soybean domesticated process is unknown. with the aim to detect the possible role of gi in soybean domestication of flowering time, we focused on the variation of gia alleles in wild and domesticated soybeans with a wide geographic distribution. we also investigated variations in gia expression in soybeans with significant variations in flowering time. because soybean transformation is extremely difficult, the role of gmgia alleles in flowering time was further examined in transgenic arabidopsis. our analyses suggest that the molecular and functional evolution of gmgia haplotypes demonstrate evidence for the selection of this gene in soybean flowering adaptation, and reinforce the hypothesis that the yellow river region is likely the main origin of soybean domestication in china.

RESULTS
variations in flowering time in soybean
we first evaluated the variation of flowering time in soybean populations and correlated these phenotypes to geographic regions. wild populations consisted of  <dig> individuals from china, japan, and korea. domesticated accessions, distributed in different ecological regions in china, included  <dig> landraces and  <dig> cultivars . while these soybeans were grown in the same natural light conditions , a significant difference in flowering time was observed between wild and cultivated soybeans . the flowering time for wild and domesticated soybeans was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days after germination  hinting that early flowering might be a breeding target for soybean domestication. consistent with the previous findings  <cit> , we also found that flowering time was negatively correlated with the geographic origin of the soybeans, particularly in the cultivated varieties . forty-five accessions of wild  and  <dig> cultivated  varieties flowered, but did not produce seeds. moreover, accessions, which set seeds flowered much earlier than those that failed to set seeds , and the proportion of these non-seed setting accessions was negatively correlated with their latitude of the collection site , indicating that flowering time, affected by geographic latitude of planting place, is a barrier to the soybean radiation interception and wide cultivation. these results also suggest that flowering time is a key domestication trait for soybean fecundity.fig.  <dig> flowering time variations in soybean. a box-plot of flowering time variation in soybeans in beijing. b correlation of geographic origin  and beijing flowering time in soybeans. gm, g. max; gs, g. soja. c the proportion of the chinese accessions that did not produce seeds in beijing. the collection covered different regions of china: ner, northeast region; nr, north region; hr, huanghuai region; sr, south region. the numbers for accessions in different soybean populations are shown in brackets. the related details are presented in 



sequence and expression diversity of gi homologs in soybean
gi homologs exert a role in flowering time control and to better understand this role in soybeans, we evaluated their expression and sequence variation. three gi homologs were found in soybean, and designated gia, gib, and gic that were localized to chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . we first examined the expression of gi homologs in one wild  and one domesticate  during its development into flowers. the two accessions had different flowering time under natural conditions . however, soybeans are strictly short-day plants. as control, the expression of the putative flowering time genes was therefore investigated during soybean development under short-day  conditions. qrt-pcr analyses showed that all gi homologous genes had a similar dynamic expression profile  in trifoliate leaves of wild and cultivated soybeans under sd, which was slightly elevated around 15 days after germination  . the expression of the putative downstream genes of gi, i.e. ft, apetala <dig> , and co orthologs were simultaneously investigated , and we found that both gmft5a and gmap <dig> expression started increasing around dag <dig> and peaked after dag <dig>  while the co homolog was constitutively expressed albeit its fluctuations during soybean development , thus each of these genes shared a similar expression profile during the development of these two accessions. however, co expression was not correlated to the expression of gmft5a and gmap <dig>  concomitantly, the flowering time of the two soybean accessions was around dag <dig> under sd, further indicating that wild and cultivated soybeans had different sensitivities to photoperiod. these observations in these two accessions seemed to support the gi-like regulating ft expression in the co-independent manner in the control flowering time in soybean, but it could not tell whether gi homologs played a regulatory role. in addition, these observations suggested that dag <dig> is an appropriate time for material harvest to evaluate gene expression diversity related to flowering in a soybean population level under sd.fig.  <dig> expression of gi homologs and putative flowering time genes in soybeans. a the expression of gia, gib, and gic during the seedling development of wild and domesticated soybeans under short-day conditions . b the expression profiles of co, ft, and ap <dig> homologs during the seedling development of wild and domesticated soybeans under sd. dag: days after germination. flowering time is indicated by a red arrow. both gs  and gm  flowered around dag <dig>  c the expression of gia, gib, and gic in wild  and domesticated  populations  were investigated using qrt-pcr. only gia haplotypes were indicated as red, green, and blue for h <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig>  respectively. others in wild soybeans are in gray. the flowering time  was recorded as the days from germination to the appearance of the first flower bud. the correlation coefficient between the flowering time and the gi expression in wild and domesticated populations is shown. gm, g. max; gs, g. soja




to distinguish the role of the three gi homologs in flowering time, we harvested trifoliate leaves at dag <dig> to expand the gi expression analysis to a larger soybean population. thirty-two accessions of each of g. soja and g. max were randomly selected and were grown under sd conditions. all accessions flowered earlier under sd conditions, than seen in natural conditions , and flowering time was not significantly different between wild and domesticated populations under these conditions , for example, in natural light conditions, zyd <dig> and zdd <dig> flowered around dag <dig> and dag <dig>  respectively, but they flowered around dag <dig> under sd. these observations suggest that sd conditions circumvent the differential regulation of flowering time in soybean. however, the expression of gib and gic was not found to be correlated to flowering time variation in either population under sd conditions. interestingly, gsgia expression was correlated with flowering time  in wild populations, although this correlation was lacking for gmgia in domesticated populations .

to evaluate the nucleotide diversity of soybean gi homologs,  <dig> landraces and  <dig> wild accessions were analyzed , which were randomly selected to maximally cover the geographic distribution. sequencing analyses suggested that the gia-e coding region covering the premature stop codon earlier identified by watanabe et al.  <cit>  showed a higher sequence diversity in cultivated soybeans than that in wild soybeans , which might be due to the extremely high frequency of this mutation in cultivated soybeans. five genomic regions of gia were further sequenced in these accessions , and we observed that despite the high diversity in wild soybeans, relatively low diversity was detected in domesticated accessions . however, the sequence diversity of randomly selected gib and gic genomic regions was also evaluated , and no significant difference was found between the wild and cultivated accessions . in all of these cases, the wild and cultivated soybeans shared a common set of haplotypes of each gi gene  hinting at a common ancestor. phylogenetic trees constructed from the gi sequences showed that gia was clearly distinguishable between the wild and the domesticated accessions; however, gib and gic were not, although they were clearly differentiated from gia . these observations imply that the specific selection on gia may be responsible for the differences in flowering time between wild and cultivated soybean accessions, and thus perhaps the target of flowering time during soybean domestication.

selection of gia alleles in soybean
to substantiate the previous assumption, we investigated the allelic variation of gia in wild and cultivated soybeans. six polymorphic fragments of gia were examined in all of the accessions . forty-seven haplotypes were found in the wild populations  designated h1–h <dig> based on the concatenated sequences of the six sequenced fragments, three of which  accounted for all accessions of the domesticated populations . median-joining haplotype networks showed that the genotypes could be divided into two branches: one included h <dig> and h <dig> haplotypes and the other branch covered the h <dig> haplotype. in the domesticated soybean populations of  <dig> accessions, h <dig> was the most frequent haplotype at  <dig>  % followed by h <dig> at  <dig>  % and h <dig> at  <dig>  %, while the frequencies of these haplotypes were much lower in  <dig> accessions of wild soybeans at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % respectively. phylogenetic trees revealed that h <dig> might independently originate from h <dig> and h <dig>  while the h <dig> radiated within cultivated soybeans . despite this, h <dig> was very closely related to h <dig>  with the divergence being a single a/t transition that introduced a premature stop codon in the 10th exon , which was also characterized as e <dig>  <cit> .fig.  <dig> median-joining haplotype networks of gia in soybeans. to display the proportions of different germplasm inside each circle,  <dig> wild accessions were analyzed according to the frequency of different haplotypes in  <dig> landraces. the area of the circles is proportional to the frequency of each haplotype. sections inside each circle reveal the proportion of different populations possessing the same haplotype. black dots  represent missing or extinct sequences. red dots between two circles represent a mutational site



the sequence diversity of the gia gene was also estimated for all the haplotypes in wild and domesticated soybean populations in terms of nucleotide diversity  and polymorphism  . the nucleotide diversity and nucleotide polymorphism of gia was reduced in domesticates  relative to wild populations . while previous estimates show that domesticated soybeans retain 66 %  and 49 %  of the nucleotide diversity of wild soybeans after the domestication bottleneck  <cit> , both the π and θ of gia were reduced to  <dig>  and  <dig>  % in domesticated accessions relative to wild accessions, indicating that gia might have been under selection. a weak selection signal was detected in this particular gene locus  <cit> . however, the flanking down- and upstream sequences of the gia locus on the chromosome  <dig> showed relatively high sequence diversity only when h <dig>  a haplotype with the lowest frequency in cultivated soybeans, was excluded , implying that gmgia h <dig> had likely introgressed from a wild-type allele.fig.  <dig> soybean gia is selected for flowering time variation. a the nucleotide diversity of gia in soybeans. if h <dig> haplotype is identified as a wild allele, there are only two domesticated alleles. h: haplotypes, hd: haplotype diversity, π: nucleotide diversity, θ: nucleotide polymorphism. b

functional variations in domesticated gia alleles that influence flowering time
in an attempt to infer the role of different gia haplotypes in soybean flowering variation, phenotypic variation was attributed to each haplotype. in domesticated populations the earliest flowering varieties possessed h <dig> haplotype, while the latest flowering varieties had the h <dig> haplotype . the flowering time was significantly different between accessions possessing each haplotype of the cultivated accessions when employing both an anova test  and a multiple regression analysis . while the wild haplotypes were diverse, accessions possessing both h <dig> and h <dig> flowered relatively earlier than the accessions harboring h <dig> . these observations support the role of the diversity in gmgia genotypes in the variation of soybean flowering time.

sequencing revealed that the gmgia haplotypes were putatively transcribed into three isoforms in the cultivated soybeans. both h <dig> and h <dig> of gmgia encoded a putative 1177-amino acid  peptide, while h <dig> encoded a truncated isoform with  <dig> aa due to the premature stop codon in the 10th exon . the h <dig> protein was distinguished from h <dig> isoform by only one conservative amino acid substitution , thus there may not be any of functional divergence between these two isoforms . however, h <dig> might be non-functional because it was prematurely terminated.

gi forms a complex with the flavin-binding, kelch repeat, f-box  <dig>  protein to function in the photoperiod flowering pathway in arabidopsis and this gi-fkf <dig> interaction is conserved in soybean  <cit> . in corroboration with our assumptions on the functional divergence of different gmgia isoforms, using yeast-two hybrid assays we found that the h <dig> isoform had a weaker interaction with gmfkf <dig>  while both h <dig> and h <dig> had a strong interactions with gmfkf <dig> . next, we investigated the consequence of these differential interaction strengths in transgenic arabidopsis. three transgenic arabidopsis lines of each genetic manipulation were verified by the expression of transgenes . as we expected, we found that in a wild-type  columbia background, h <dig> and h <dig> delayed flowering with a similar extent but h <dig> did not affect flowering . however, in the arabidopsis gi- <dig> background, a mutant with extremely late flowering, h <dig> and h <dig> transgenic plants did not rescue flowering time, whereas, surprisingly, h <dig> transgenic arabidopsis lines partially rescued the floral phenotypic variation due to the gi mutation . in this scenario, gmgia and atgi may share the interacting protein  in wt arabidopsis, while gmgia may solely occupy atfkf1in the gi- <dig> background. indeed gmgia isoforms differentially interacted with atfkf <dig> in yeast . these results suggest that h <dig> and h <dig> haplotypes may repress flowering, in contrast to h <dig> possibly acting as an activator, thus increasing the frequency of h <dig> during domestication as a target for earlier flowering.fig.  <dig> analysis of gmgia in transgenic arabidopsis.

geographic distribution of soybean gia haplotypes
to further understand the role of gia in soybean domestication, we pinpointed the collection origin of these haplotypes geographically . in wild soybean populations ,  <dig> gsgia haplotypes had a complex and diverse geographic distribution; however, a significant and interesting pattern was apparent when considering only the putatively domesticated haplotypes. h <dig> was restricted to yellow river region of china that includes a part of nr  and hr , while h <dig> and h <dig> were respectively limited to sr  and ner  with a very low frequency . moreover, the wild haplotypes closely related to h <dig> were mainly limited to sr, while the closely related wild haplotypes of h <dig> were distributed in ner. only one h <dig> and one h <dig> in wild soybean were collected near the yellow river region. in soybean landraces , h <dig> and h <dig> had a distribution that overlapped perfectly with its wild orthologs. in contrast, h <dig> was found in the whole of china with a high frequency in domesticated populations . as a rare haplotype in wild soybeans, h <dig> was only found in yellow river region of china and was spread to all the other eco-regions of chinese cultivated soybeans, suggesting that h <dig> might have undergone artificial selection and human aided dispersal during soybean domestication in china. interestingly, the three gmgia haplotypes were also found in japanese cultivars  <cit> , but gsgia h <dig> was not found in japanese wild soybeans suggesting that cultivated soybeans in japan may have been introduced from china.fig.  <dig> geographic distribution of gia haplotypes in soybeans. a distribution of the gsgia haplotypes of wild soybeans.  <dig> haplotypes were named as h <dig> to h <dig>  b distribution of the gmgia haplotypes in soybean landraces. three haplotypes were designated as h <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig>  which are shared by the wild soybeans. the haplotypes of domesticated soybeans in japan are also restricted to h <dig> to h <dig> for  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> individuals respectively  <cit> . gm, g. max; gs, g. soja. the colored symbols represent the different gia haplotypes as indicated. c the gmgia radiation pathways during soybean domestication. in wild populations, h <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig> were restricted to different ecological regions in china: h <dig> in the yellow river region , h <dig> in nr , and h <dig> in ner . three major radiation events and places of gmgia h <dig> , h <dig> , and h <dig>  are proposed by different color arrows. h <dig> is assumed to be later introgressed from the wild soybeans in northeast region of china, thus the very likely origin place of the domesticated soybeans might be the yellow river region and the sr of china. however, considering the h <dig> distribution in wild soybeans, and the dominant h <dig> frequency in cultivated soybeans, the major domestication event might occur in the yellow river region of china. the yellow, green, red, and gray areas respectively indicate ner, nr, hr and sr ecological regions in china. the blue line represents the yellow river. the pink star indicates beijing. latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates are shown. the baseline map was created by us using diva-gis version  <dig> .0



discussion
domestication is a complex process that involves human selection and plant adaptation to different environments that is accompanied by morphological and phonological changes  <cit>  that distinguish cultivated crops from their progenitors  <cit> . seed shattering traits in rice, changes of plant architecture in maize, fruit size in tomato, and flowering time in barley and wheat are domestication traits that have been described  <cit> . the evolution of flowering time is critical for plant domestication and the adaptation to new environments. as a domestication trait, flowering has been characterized in crop domestication, i.e. vrn and ppd genes in wheat and barley  <cit> , hd <dig> in rice  <cit> , the ft/tfl <dig> gene family in cultivated sunflower  <cit> , and zmcct in maize  <cit> . to gain a greater understanding of soybean domestication, in the present work, we evaluated flowering time variation in soybean, and the evolution of the gi family, a key regulator of flowering time.

flowering time is a domesticated trait of soybean
days-to-flowering is a domestication trait of soybean that differentiates cultivated accessions from their wild relatives  <cit> . cultivated soybeans were domesticated to flower earlier than wild soybeans for high grain yield and wide cultivation  <cit> . although a few soybean cultivars that have lost its photoperiod sensitivity were isolated  <cit> , a reduction in photoperiod sensitivity is favored during soybean domestication. both wild and cultivated soybeans are generally short-day plants, and flowering is delayed under long-day conditions. because we found that the phase transition of some soybean accessions was delayed in beijing under natural lighting, and while they ultimately flowered, they did not produce seed. moreover, the extent of these phenotypic variations indeed negatively correlated with the latitude of the collection places of these non-reproductive soybeans . our findings are in line with the previous observations  <cit> . however, we observed that the soybean accessions that were non-reproductive in beijing’s environments were sensitive to photoperiod and flowered early under short-day conditions. these observations indicate the existence of a geographic barrier to soybean radiation that can be solved by a change in photoperiods. thus, flowering time is an important soybean domestication trait, yet studies investigating genes associated with this domesticated trait were lacking. gi homologs, important regulators in the photoperiod pathway, function as activators for flowering in many plants; such as, arabidopsis, pea, wheat and barley , while some can act as repressors of flowering such as rice, soybean, and petunia  <cit> . soybean has  <dig> gi homologs ; however, through comparisons of gene expression and sequence diversity variation between the wild and cultivated soybeans we demonstrated that soybean gia is specifically involved in the earlier flowering time associated with domestication.

variations in gia haplotypes are responsible for the observed differences in flowering time in soybean
in wild soybeans, substantial amount and diversity of haplotypes were seen; however, their association with flowering time variation is not easily established. nevertheless, the variation in the gia expression seemed to play a pronounced role in the variation of the flowering time. a previous study suggested that almost 81 % of rare alleles in the wild soybean populations were purged by the soybean domestication bottleneck  <cit> . in line with the previous whole genome association analysis  <cit> , our gene-focused analysis of gia’s flanking sequence in soybean landraces also conditionally supports selection on the gmgia locus. furthermore, we found that more than 93 %  of the wild haplotypes of gia were lost during soybean domestication and breeding, and only h <dig>  h <dig>  and h <dig> were maintained in domesticated accessions. while h <dig> produced a truncated protein, h <dig> and h <dig> produced nearly indistinguishable, full-length proteins. in line with this previous work  <cit> , we found that h <dig> is prevalent in cultivated accessions, and the accessions harboring h <dig>  show significantly earlier flowering with statistical power. however, for the first time, we found  <dig> wild soybean accessions harbored h <dig> and they usually flowered earlier  than the average flowering time in all wild accessions . thus, the appearance and radiation of h <dig> seemed to play a prominent role in soybean domestication.

as expected, we further found that in transgenic arabidopsis both h <dig> and h <dig> could not compensate the flowering defect in gi- <dig> mutants, but could delay flowering in wild type arabidopsis, suggesting that the full length gmgia isoforms repress flowering in transgenic arabidopsis. therefore, our work reinforces that soybean gia is a floral repressor, and indicates that arabidopsis and glycine may share a common regulatory and interacting network associated with gi. h <dig> is a mutated allele of gia, and we also observed that h <dig> indeed had little effect on flowering in wild type arabidopsis. however, beyond our expectations, it is interesting that in transgenic arabidopsis the h <dig> isoform could promote flowering in gi- <dig> mutants, thus hinting that h <dig> might not be a null mutation. the observations in transgenic analyses could be partially explained by different interacting capabilities of different gmgia isoforms with atfkf <dig>  but they could also reflect differences in interacting networks of gi orthologs that regulate flowering between arabidopsis and glycine. alternatively, the interacting network of gi orthologs might be relatively conserved, although these play either as a floral activator or repressor in different plants . the opposite effect of gi orthologs in its own hosts might be due to its sequence variations, because a single amino acid substitution could sufficiently reverse the role of a flowering time gene  <cit> . it could also be possible that the truncated soybean gia  could promote flowering instead of non-functionalization. while further studies are needed to investigate these hypotheses, nevertheless, gmgia is a key participant in the regulation of flowering time in soybeans.

h <dig> might have originated from the northeast region of china  and was restricted to the northern latitude, whereas the soybeans in these regions tend to flower earlier. however, h <dig> repressed flowering in transgenic arabidopsis. the present study observed that h3-harboring soybeans genetically deviated from h2-derived soybeans; therefore, other e loci might function in early flowering in h3-harboring soybeans. the frequency of h <dig> was relatively low in both wild-type and cultivated soybeans, which also indicated that h <dig> might be an introgressed allele of wild soybeans from ner. when the h <dig> was excluded, our selection analyses supported the suggestion from the recent whole genome association analyses that showed the possibility of selection on the gia locus  <cit> . h <dig> might be the major selected gia allele during the domestication or the postdomestication radiation of cultivated soybeans. interestingly, our further comparative studies between wild and domesticated soybeans suggest that selection acted differentially on gia. in wild soybeans, selection in nature mainly acts on the gsgia expression variation among these gsgia haplotypes. however, selection under cultivated conditions is clearly associated with the variation of the coding region of gmgi haplotypes. among the three domesticated haplotypes, h <dig> is the most successful for early flowering and may have facilitated the radiation of soybeans after domestication.

geographic radiation of gmgia alleles reflects soybean domestication processes
the processes of domestication vary substantially among crop species. with a single domestication event, maize was domesticated from its wild progenitor , distributed in highland mexico  <cit> . however, barley and rice were domesticated from their wild ancestors by two domestication events  <cit> . cultivated soybeans were hypothesized to have been domesticated from wild soybeans in china, but controversy existed about the origin of the first cultivated soybeans  <cit> . the ner , sr , and yellow river region in china were assumed to be the origins of cultivated soybean. in the present work, the geographic evolution and distribution of gia alleles sheds light on the soybean domestication process .

the previous structural analyses also suggest that the genetic subdivisions of the soybean populations used in the present work were well clustered by geographic location such as ner, nr, hr, and sr in china , thus the population is ideal for understanding the soybean domestication process. we found that h <dig> is a rare haplotype in wild soybeans restricted to the yellow river region in china, yet it is highly abundant in many cultivated soybean accessions from all detected geographic subgroups, suggesting that soybean domestication may have occurred in the yellow river region. h <dig> was not detected in wild soybeans from japan and korea in the present study, although it was identified in japanese cultivated soybeans  <cit> . however, a more extensive sampling of japanese and korean wild soybean would be required to test the hypothesis that soybean domestication occurred in the yellow river region of china with h <dig> haplotype subsequently spreading to japan, korea and the rest of the world  <cit> . both h <dig>  and h <dig>  were likely introduced into the domesticated soybeans by introgression. the distribution of h <dig> and h <dig> haplotypes beyond its sites of origin was limited by their relatively later flowering, thus establishing the current geographic pattern that lacks h <dig> in sr and h <dig> in ner. this scenario seems to support the hypothesis that soybean was domesticated from its wild progenitor in yellow river region of china  <cit> .

h <dig> was closely related to h <dig>  and it is possible that h <dig> may have been derived from h <dig> due to a single mutation in the 10th exon, which could make the original domestication site be sr, the origin of h <dig>  this is in line with the hypothesis of the soybean origination in south china  <cit> . in this scenario, the premature stop mutation occurred in h <dig> thus generating h <dig> in the yellow river region. h <dig> was more efficient in promoting flowering with a wider adaptation than h <dig>  thus h <dig> was therefore presumably then selected by ancient soybean breeders and quickly distributed to different regions of china. during the radiation of h <dig> to ner, h <dig> may have been introduced into cultivated soybeans by wild-type allele introgression. as a result, h <dig> exists in domesticated soybeans with a high frequency and wide distribution, while h <dig> and h <dig> are restricted to the regions near to their origin, and have very low frequency in the cultivated soybeans in china. based on the archaeological record  <cit> , multiple origins of domesticated soybean cannot be excluded. independent recruitment of h <dig>  in ner of china, a gia allele functionally diverged from h2-derived h <dig>  might partially support this notion. this assumption contradicts the hypothesis of a single domestication event in soybean  <cit> , and thus the soybean domestication process is still in debate. conclusively revealing the origin of soybean domestication requires a combined investigation of the evolution of multiple key domesticated genes and human historical activities. the present study showed that the evolution of gia alleles plays a role in soybean domestication of flowering time, and the origin and radiation of h <dig> may primarily reflect the origin of cultivated soybeans. the distribution and frequency of the h <dig> haplotype among wild and cultivated soybeans supports the concept that the yellow river region is most likely the main origin of soybean cultivars.

CONCLUSIONS
as a critical trait for reproduction and adaptation to different environments, domesticating flowering time was a crucial component of soybean domestication. the gia h <dig> haplotype that harbors a premature stop codon is an allele for an early flowering prevalent in domesticated soybeans. the wild h <dig> haplotype originated in the yellow river region and is restricted to this area. however, the soybean accessions harboring h <dig> did not always flower early indicating the complexity of the flowering control pathway. nevertheless, in light of the evolution of gia gene, human selection for an early flowering phenotype might have at least occurred in the yellow river region during soybean domestication.
