BACKGROUND
skin constantly renews throughout adult life. the proliferative compartment of epidermis is confined to the basal layer, where it harbors stem cells, and their progeny, transient amplifying cells  <cit> . stem cells are predominantly quiescent in situ. transient amplifying cells are more rapidly cycling, and after dividing for a limited period of time cease to proliferate and undergo terminal differentiation while moving towards the skin surface  <cit> . slow cycling stem cells of the murine epidermis were identified by the retention of brdu or thymidine after prolonged chase  <cit> . research aimed at isolating stem cells directly from human tissue has to be based on different methodological approaches. putative human interfollicular stem cells have been enriched based on the expression of β <dig> integrin  <cit> , transferin receptor  <cit> , connexin  <dig>  <cit> , an isoform of cd <dig>  <cit>  and desmosomal proteins  <cit> . however, it has not been determined whether these cells represent distinct populations, or belong to overlapping cell subsets. databases generated from gene expression profiles of stem cells provide useful resources in evaluating putative stem cell populations. the lack or low levels of mhci molecules have been reported in stem cells of several tissues  <cit> . downregulation of mhci transcripts has been observed in mouse hair follicle stem cells  <cit> . we have previously isolated a subpopulation of human basal keratinocytes with low/negative mhci expression   <cit> . cells with α6+/mhci- phenotype constitute a small fraction of the basal layer  as determined by flow cytometry  <cit> . we found that α6+/mhci- cells were keratinocytes as they expressed keratin  <dig> . the α6+/mhci- cells exhibited characteristics attributed to stem cells: they were clonogenic in vitro, relatively small, and had low granularity  <cit> . in the present work we employ microarray technology, to report global transcriptional profiles of two cell populations: the basal cells that express mhci, α6+/mhci+  and the basal cells that have low/negative mhci expression, α6+/mhci- cells, . cells were isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorter  directly from human epidermis. further comparisons were made with published data of hair follicle stem cell gene expression profiles.

in addition, using flow cytometry we have analyzed the expression of nuclear proliferation antigen, ki <dig>  our data indicate that mhci- cells are quiescent in situ. following facs sorting, α6+/mhci-and α6+/mhci+ cells were grown at clonal densities to determine their colony forming efficiency . the analysis of cfes in the initial, primary, culture and in the first passage indicate that α6+/mhci- cells have higher proliferative potential than α6+/mhci+ cells, another feature attributed to stem cells.

RESULTS
skin is the largest and most accessible organ in the body. the differentiation axis of the interfollicular epidermis is spatially well defined: the basal layer contains proliferating cells, while suprabasal layers, stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, and stratum corneum harbor post-mitotic, differentiating keratinocytes  <cit> . these features facilitate the analysis of cells at the specific differentiation stage. like all self-renewing tissues, epidermis contains stem cells, which are located in the stratum basale. several proteins have been suggested as markers for keratinocyte stem cell enrichment  <cit> . we have previously described a basal keratinocyte population that lacks gap junction protein cx <dig> in human and mouse epidermis  <cit> . we have shown that cx <dig> negative cells co-localize with label-retaining cells, hair follicle bulge stem cells  <cit> . cx <dig> negative keratinocytes comprise about 10% of human basal keratinocytes and are blast like, small and have low granularity as determined by flow cytometry. cells in the limbus of the eye, the region of the corneal epithelium that contains stem cells, were also shown to lack cx <dig>  <cit> . in searching for additional markers that can be used to obtain viable cells, we isolated a subset of cx <dig> negative keratinocytes characterized by low/negative expression of mhci that comprised up to 2% of basal epidermal cells  <cit> . it was believed that almost all nucleated cells express mhci  <cit> . recently, however, stem cells of several tissues were shown to lack mhci expression  <cit> . molecules encoded by mhc are involved in self/non-self discrimination in vertebrates. mhci molecules bind endogenously derived peptides and stimulate a distinct branch of the adaptive immune system mediated by cd8+ t cells. the human mhc termed hla  encodes three classical polymorphic class i genes: hla a, b, and c. to isolate transient amplifying cells  and presumptive stem cells , we used antibodies against α <dig> integrin, a basal cell marker, in combination with antibodies against β <dig> microglobulin, the light chain of mhci molecule. previously we have shown that similar results were obtained regardless of whether antibodies to mhci heavy chain, or antibodies against β <dig> microglobulin were used  <cit> .

α6+/mhci- cells are quiescent in situ, yet in culture display higher proliferative potential
during tissue homeostasis stem cells are infrequently dividing; thus, and one of the characteristics of stem cells is their quiescence in situ. to determine the proliferative status of mhci- and mhci+populations, we analyzed the expression of nuclear proliferation antigen ki <dig>  which is a marker for actively cycling cells. the data presented reflect keratinocyte proliferation since in normal epidermis, non keratinocytes are found to be non-cycling  <cit> . although the absolute values of ki <dig> may vary depending on the total number of gated cells, the ratio of ki <dig> expressing mhci- and mhci+ cells is held constant. flow cytometric analysis showed that mhci+ cells expressed more than four time higher levels of ki <dig> than mhci- cells . only  <dig> % of mhci- cells expressed ki <dig>  while  <dig> % of mhci+cells were in the cell cycle. given the low percentages of mhci-cells in the basal layer, it is clear that the bulk of cell production in the epidermis is accomplished through divisions of transient amplifying cells, a finding which is in accordance with the established view of epidermal homeostasis.

high proliferative potential is another feature of stem cells. one way of assessing proliferative potential of keratinocytes is to analyze their colony forming efficiency   <cit> . to assess proliferative potential of the two cell populations' colony forming efficiency  was analyzed in the primary and secondary cultures. sorted cells were seeded at clonal densities and colonies formed evaluated after two weeks. in primary cultures, α6+/mhci- cells exhibited lower colony forming efficiency than α6+/mhci+ cells . however, in secondary cultures α6+/mhci- showed higher cfe than α6+/mhci+ cells. from primary to secondary culture, an increase of  <dig> times was observed in the cfe of α6+/mhci- cells, while the cfe of α6+/mhci+ cells increased only  <dig>  times . previously, lower initial cfe was observed in limbal epithelial stem cell  <cit> . our data indicate that α6+/mhci- cells have higher proliferative potential than α6+/mhci+ cells, another characteristic attributed to stem cells. the majority of available data regarding cfe are from secondary or tertiary keratinocyte cultures  <cit> . in the secondary cultures, α6+/mhci- cells did display higher cfe than α6+/mhci+ cells, which is an indication of a higher proliferative potential of the α6+/mhci- cells  <cit> . the lower cfe of α6+/mhci- cells compared to α6+/mhci+ cells that we recorded in our primary cultures may be due to the time needed for stem cells to transit from a quiescent to a proliferative state.

gene expression profile indicates that α6+/mhci- cells exhibit properties of stem cells
microarray profiles of stem cells and their progeny provide a global view into differences of expression of a large number of genes and enable analyses of molecular processes involved in self renewal, proliferation and differentiation. gene expression profiles of hair follicle bulge stem cells were recently reported  <cit> , yet until now no data are available with regard to human interfollicular keratinocyte stem cells. we report on transcriptional profiles of putative human keratinocyte stem cells and their immediate progeny, transient amplifying cells. global gene expression profile was obtained from sorted α6+/mhci- cells and α6+/mhci+ cells using dna microarray chips. we identified a comprehensive list of differentially expressed genes. notably, all of the mhci genes were downregulated in α6+/mhci- cells, thus confirming the successful separation of α6+/mhci+ and α6+/mhci- cells. the data also show that expression of mhci proteins in keratinocytes is regulated at the transcriptional level. the hla-e transcript is downregulated in α6+/mhci- cells confirming our previous results obtained at the protein level  <cit> . the expression of non-classical hla molecules is thought to protect cells that lack classical hla expression from lysis by nk cells. at present, it is not known what mechanisms protect presumptive stem cells, mhci- cells, from attack by nk cells, especially since mhci- cells do not express detectable levels of non-classical hla-e and hla-g molecules  <cit> .

we found that most of the mrnas of genes encoding cellular receptors and other cell surface molecules were more abundant in α6+/mhci- cells than in α6+/mhci+ cells . conversely, mrnas of genes encoding proteins that take part in ribosome biosynthesis, rna splicing, translation, protein degradation, and energy metabolism were more abundant in α6+/mhci+ cells . these findings are consistent with reports by other investigators who demonstrated that stem cells are characterized by few ribosomes and mitochondria  but contain a large numbers of receptors  <cit> .

in reference to stem cells quiescence, it should also be noted that transcripts of cdkn1c and cdkn2a whose products are cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors were enriched in α6+/mhci- cells . the product of cdkn1c, p57kip <dig>  one of the cip/kip family members, is tightly associated with inhibition of proliferation of human interfollicular keratinocytes  <cit> , and is upregulated in hair follicle bulge  <cit> , while the product of cdkn2a, a  <dig> kda protein p16ink4a imposes a g <dig> cell cycle arrest  <cit> . furthermore, in addition to the low protein level of ki <dig> observed in mhci negative population , the transcript of ki <dig> was less abundant in α6+/mhci- cells . conversely, transcripts of genes encoding proteins that are related to cell proliferation such as cyclins, proteins involved in chromosome remodeling, dna replication and repair were preferentially enriched in α6+/mhci+ cells .

functional classification of some of the genes that are selectively upregulated ≥  <dig> fold in α6+/mhci+ cells relative to α6+/mhci- cells . the numbers shown in parentheses are in log <dig> scale and are the highest score for that gene. expression of the genes marked with  have been additionally verified .

interestingly, type i ifn  has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation by inducing g <dig> cell cycle arrest. it has been reported that interferon α  has antiproliferative effects on bone marrow stromal precursors, hepatic progenitor cells, and mesenchymal stem cells  <cit> . we observed enrichment of transcripts of the ifn-α family of proteins in α6+/mhci- cells as well as stat <dig>  the specific transducing activator of ifn-α transcription. this is the first report that suggests involvement of type i ifn in epidermal stem cell quiescence. further studies are needed to determine whether ifn-α is synthesized by α6+/mhci- cells, whether its pathway is active and whether it contributes to α6+/mhci- cell quiescence .

it has been reported that the components of the inositol phospholipid signaling system are present and that the system itself is active in murine embryonic stem cells  <cit> . in the present study, we demonstrate that several components of the inositol phospholipid signaling system are enriched in α6+/mhci- cells . nevertheless, the functional significance of this observation needs further investigation.

among the transcripts enriched in α6+/mhci- cells, there were transcripts previously shown to be upregulated in cell population enriched for human interfollicular stem cells, such as α <dig> integrin  <cit> , melanoma-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan  <cit> , phosphorylase kinase α <dig>  <cit> , and the transcript of p <dig> homolog p51/p73l/p63/p <dig>  <cit>  . using flow cytometry we found that mhci- cells expressed lower level of transferrin receptor , a negative marker used to enrich for interfollicular epidermal stem cells  <cit> , when compared to mhci+ cells . it should also be noted that although differences in the expression of cd <dig> transcript were lower than  <dig> fold, cd <dig> mrna was downregulated in α6+/mhci- cells compared to α6+/mhci+ cells consistently in both arrays .

among the transcripts enriched in α6+/mhci+ cells, there were mrnas of genes whose products are expressed at low levels in cell population enriched for human interfollicular stem cells, such as desmosomal proteins including desmoglein  <dig>   <cit> , as well as the proliferation associated transcription factor c-myc, found to be expressed at the lower levels in cultured human interfollicular stem cells  <cit>  . moreover, it has been reported that epidermal growth factor receptor  signaling is downregulated in putative human interfollicular stem cells  <cit> . in accordance with this observation, we found that egfr itself was downregulated in α6+/mhci- cells .

most notably, we present results that demonstrate that putative stem cells have lower expression of mrnas encoding proteins that take part in energy metabolism, which can explain how stem cells can be quiescent and at the same time maintain small size .

comparison of α6+/mhci- and α6+/mhci+ microarray databases with the transcriptional profiles of human and mouse hair follicle stem cells
we compared α6+/mhci- transcriptional profile with the published transcriptional profile of human hair follicle stem cells  <cit>  and with four different sets of data of murine hair follicle stem cells  <cit> . we found that eleven genes, which were enriched in human hair follicle stem cells, were also enriched in α6+/mhci- cells . similarly, mrnas of nine genes, which were downregulated in human hair follicle stem cells, were also downregulated in α6+/mhci- cells . nevertheless, the differences between the gene expression profiles of stem cells from the two human tissues, i.e. interfollicular and follicular, were also observed including the genes that demonstrated two fold difference in the expression  .

functional classification of some of the genes that are selectively upregulated ≥  <dig> fold in α6+/mhci- cells relative to α6+/mhci+ cells . the numbers shown in parentheses are in log <dig> scale and are the highest scores for that gene.

mrnas of eighty-two genes, which were enriched in murine hair follicle stem cells, were also enriched in α6+/mhci- cells, while mrnas of forty-one genes, which were downregulated in murine hair follicle stem cells, were also downregulated in α6+/mhci- cells . transcription factors lhx <dig> and tcf <dig> that were shown to maintain sc features  <cit> , were among the genes that were upregulated in α6+/mhci- cells as well as in murine hair follicle stem cells. upon screening of our microarray database for tcf <dig> targets  <cit> , we found that transcripts of twelve genes reported to be upregulated by tcf <dig> were more abundant in α6+/mhci- cells and conversely transcripts of nine genes repressed by tcf <dig> were more abundant in α6+/mhci+ cells . interestingly, both arrays that we performed showed that lhx <dig> was among the most upregulated mrnas in α6+/mhci- cells, while wif- <dig> mrna, which was the most enriched mrna in murine hair follicle stem cells according to one report  <cit> , was the mrna that showed the highest difference of expression between α6+/mhci- cells and α6+/mhci+ cells .

uupregulation of transcripts encoding bone morphogenic factors in α6+/mhci- cells
it has been shown that tgf-β and the bone morphogenic factors are upregulated in epidermal stem cells  <cit> . consequently, hair follicle stem cells are enriched with tgf-β/bmp targets  <cit> . in accordance with those findings, we observed that transcripts of several genes whose products are necessary for the activation of tgf-β/phospho-smad pathway, such as genes necessary for latent tgf-β activation , secreted activators , and transcriptional activators of tgf-β responses , were enriched in α6+/mhci- cells compared to α6+/mhci+ cells . in addition, transcripts of forty-nine target genes shown to be upregulated by tgf-β/bmp pathway were more abundant in α6+/mhci- cells. conversely, transcripts of the genes whose expression is shown to be suppressed by tgf-β/phospho-smad pathway, including transcription factors c-myc and klf <dig>  were more abundant in α6+/mhci+ cells . since tgfβ/bmp pathway is tightly associated with stem cell quiescence  <cit> , upregulation of bmps in α6+/mhci- cells might explain why these cells exhibit characteristics of quiescent cells.

transcripts of wnt receptors and wnt signaling inhibitors are enriched in α6+/mhci- cells
wnt pathway plays an important role in hair follicle morphogenesis and cycling  <cit> . researchers found that transcripts of several wnt genes were downregulated in the mouse hair follicle bulge stem cells. in addition, higher levels of several genes that inhibit wnt signaling pathway as well as higher levels of transcripts of the wnt receptors were found in epidermal stem cells  <cit> . in the same cells, in general, targets of wnt signaling . furthermore, transcripts of thirty eight genes that are known to be upregulated by wnt signaling pathway were less abundant in α6+/mhci- cells, including mycbp and type i hair keratin  <dig>  . also as expected to be found in stem cells, transcripts of genes that are downregulated by wnt signaling pathway were found to be more abundant in α6+/mhci- cells. we found transcripts of fourteen such genes in α6+/mhci- cells .

transcripts of the markers implicated in mammalian growth/differentiation are downregulated in α6+/mhci- cells compared to α6+/mhci+ cells
stem cells are the least differentiated cells in their tissue of origin; therefore, transcription factors and signaling pathways that induce differentiation are expected to be downregulated in these cells. as mentioned above, we found that myc was less abundant in α6+/mhci- cells compared to α6+/mhci+ cells . upon screening of our microarray database for c-myc targets, we found that the transcripts of sixty-one genes including mycbp , which were reported previously to be upregulated by c-myc, were upregulated in α6+/mhci+ cells. conversely, transcripts of nineteen genes that were reported to be downregulated by c-myc were upregulated in α6+/mhci- cells . since many targets of c-myc are involved in the ribosomal biogenesis, the downregulation of myc may account for the observed downregulation of large numbers of genes that are involved in ribosomal biogenesis in α6+/mhci- cells , and may be an additional evidence that the downregulation of myc in stem cells is related to their quiescent/undifferentiated state.

similar to c-myc expression, the expression of klf <dig> , a transcription factor that is mainly expressed in the differentiating layers of epidermis  <cit> , and bmp <dig>  a member of bone morphogenetic protein family that is mainly expressed in proliferative basal and differentiated suprabasal keratinocytes  <cit> , were downregulated in α6+/mhci- cells compared to α6+/mhci+ cells .

notch <dig> signaling has been shown to stimulate differentiation in mammalian skin  <cit> . transcripts of the genes, such as fillagrin, integrin alpha  <dig>  loricrin,  whose expression is repressed by nothch <dig> signaling  <cit>  were more abundant in α6+/mhci- cells . furthermore, expression of krt <dig>  which is upregulated by notch <dig> signaling  <cit> , was more abundant in α6+/mhci+ cells . we investigated whether the levels of notch <dig> activity differ in α6+/mhci- and α6+/mhci+ cells. by using flow cytometry analysis with an antibody specific for cleaved/active notch <dig>  we could not detect any significant presence of cleaved/active notch <dig> in α6+/mhci- cells contrary to α6+/mhci+ cells , which indicates that differentiation-inducing pathway notch <dig> is downregulated/inhibited in α6+/mhci- cells.

it has been shown that notch <dig> signaling pathway activates nf-κb pathway and upregulates subunits of nf-κb and its targets  <cit> . thus, we investigated whether the levels of activity of nf-κb pathway, which is downstream of notch <dig> pathway, differ in mhci- and mhci+ cells. first, we analyzed the expression of nf-κb subunit rela in mhci- and mhci+ cells and found a positive correlation between the expression of nf-κb subunit rela and mhci . since both mhci molecules and nf-κb subunits are targets of nf-κb pathway, this result suggested that similar to the notch <dig> pathway, nf-κb pathway is downregulated in mhci- cells.

search of our cdna array data base for activators and targets of nf-κb pathway identified transcripts of genes, which either directly activate nf-κb pathway, or play a role in the activation of this pathway, such as bmp <dig> and malt <dig>  <cit> , that were more abundant in α6+/mhci+ cells compared to α6+/mhci- cells. furthermore, in accordance with this finding, transcripts of thirty genes that are reported to be upregulated by rel/nf-κb transcription factors  <cit> , were enriched in α6+/mhci+ cells . thus, our microarray data suggest that the nf-κb pathway is downregulated in α6+/mhci- cells as compared to α6+/mhci+ cells. to determine whether nf-κb pathway is indeed more active in α6+/mhci+ cells, we performed trans am nf-κb elisa assay using nuclear extracts of α6+/mhci+ and α6+/mhci- cells. we found that the relative amount of nuclear phospho-nf-κb p <dig> bound to dna, an indicator of an active nf-κb pathway, is higher in α6+/mhci+ cells than α6+/mhci- cells . collectively, the data demonstrate that notch <dig> signaling as well as the downstream nf-κb pathway are both downregulated in α6+/mhci- cells compared to α6+/mhci+ cells.

the comparison of our data with the transcriptional profile of the genes that are differentially expressed in the basal and differentiating layers of the epidermis
to gain further insights of epidermal differentiation, we compared our database with the published database of differentially expressed genes in basal and suprabasal layers of the human epidermis  <cit> . the comparison of our data with the transcriptional profile of the genes that are differentially expressed in the basal and differentiated layers of the epidermis suggests that tgf-β/phospho-smad pathway-induced transcription profile fades along the epidermal differentiation axis. the abundance of transcripts, which are upregulated by tgf-β/phospho-smad pathway , decrease during differentiation, from presumptive stem to transient amplifying cells  and further to cells of the suprabasal layers, where these transcripts are present at the lowest level. in addition, the transcript of madh <dig>  a transcriptional activator of tgf-β responses, is also increasingly downregulated. conversely, abundance of transcripts, which are downregulated by tgf-β/phospho-smad pathway , appear to positively correlate with the increase of epidermal differentiation .

on the other hand, the comparison suggests that notch <dig> and wnt pathway-induced transcription profiles strengthen along the epidermal differentiation axis. transcripts of myc and elf <dig>  which are upregulated by wnt signaling gradually increase. these findings are in accordance with the previous reports, which demonstrate that tgf-β/phospho-smad pathway prevents keratinocyte differentiation  <cit> , and, conversely, notch <dig> and wnt pathways induce keratinocyte differentiation  <cit> . thus, it might be possible that while tgf-β/phospho-smad pathway is gradually downregulated, wnt pathway becomes increasingly more active during epidermal differentiation. nevertheless, further investigation is necessary to validate this hypothesis. similarly, while the transcription of krt <dig>  which is upregulated by notch <dig> signaling, increases, itga <dig> mrna, which is downregulated by notch <dig> signaling, decreases in keratinocytes during differentiation . several reports demonstrated that suprabasal cells have higher notch <dig> activity than basal cells  <cit> . as already mentioned, employing flow cytometry analysis and antibodies against cleaved/active notch  <dig>  no detectable levels of cleaved/active notch  <dig> was observed in mhci- cells indicating the lack of notch <dig> activity .

interestingly, previous reports suggested that strong adherence of stem cells to extracellular matrix-rich basement membrane may be involved in retaining these cells in their natural residence   <cit> . in accordance with these observations, the comparison of our data with published transcription profiles of the basal and suprabasal cells of the epidermis revealed that during differentiation transcripts of several genes  whose products are soluble or membrane-bound factors that play a role in the interaction of cells with the microenvironment, decrease gradually during differentiation .

we also found that twenty-one genes were upregulated in α6+/mhci+ cells  alone, and later become downregulated during terminal differentiation . among these transcripts there are ones related to cell cycle  as well as mrnas of the genes whose products induce cell growth and division . since α6+/mhci- cells are quiescent, and terminally differentiating cells are post-mitotic it is not surprising to find transcripts whose products accelerates cell proliferation among the genes that are upregulated only in α6+/mhci+ cells during epidermal differentiation. similarly, genes whose products suppress cell growth and proliferation were enriched both in α6+/mhci- cells and terminally differentiating suprabasal cells, such as plagl <dig>  a zinc finger transcription factor that induces cell cycle arrest in the skin and whose expression is diminished in basal cell carcinomas  <cit> , putative tumor suppressors insulin-like growth factor-binding protein  <dig> , and doc <dig>  <cit>  .

CONCLUSIONS
most of our knowledge regarding epidermal stem cells comes from murine studies. this is the first report that uncovers the transcriptional profile of human interfollicular epidermal stem cells and their progeny, transient amplifying cells isolated directly from their niches and analyzed.

in summary, the results presented here show that α6+/mhci- cells exhibit characteristics attributed to stem cells. comparison of the transcription profiles of α6+/mhci- cells and α6+/mhci+cells with the existing profiles of hair follicle bulge stem cells further indicate that α6+/mhci- cells are enriched for stem cells. our findings may bring new insights into regulatory mechanisms involved in epidermal homeostasis, and bring understanding of deregulations of these mechanisms that take place in skin disorders including cancer, and most importantly may lead to identification of potential therapeutic targets. in addition, as a first comprehensive gene expression profile of putative human epithelial cells isolated directly from tissue, the generated database may be of importance for studies of gene expression profiles of other human epithelial tissues. by defining characteristics of interfollicular epidermal stem cells and by identifying genes whose expression is altered during differentiation, we have opened new roads for better understanding of stem cell characteristics and epidermal differentiation.
