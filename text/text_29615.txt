BACKGROUND
rhazya stricta  is among the most economically important medicinal plants adapted to the arid regions of south asia and the middle east. leaf extracts are prescribed in folk medicine for the treatment of various disorders including diabetes, sore throat, syphilis, helminthiasis, inflammatory conditions and rheumatism . at least  <dig> alkaloids have been isolated and identified from this species  <cit> . a recent study by baeshen et al.  <cit>  found that r. stricta extracts promoted apoptosis induction in breast cancer cells, suggesting its potential as a chemo-preventive or therapeutic agent. however, currently there are no genomic resources for r. stricta to facilitate the development of this species for therapeutic applications using a natural products genomics approach  <cit> .

the availability of plant genomic data has improved dramatically in recent years through the development of next-generation sequencing  technologies  and improved assembly methods  <cit> . genomic resources that provide information about gene content and the metabolic pathways that produce compounds with pharmaceutical value are paramount to the potential for improvement and application of natural products as therapeutics.

most plastid genomes have a quadripartite structure with an inverted repeat separated by large and small single-copy regions, an arrangement that is highly conserved across land plants  <cit> . plastid genome sizes of photosynthetic land plants range from  <dig> to 217 kb and contain 101- <dig> different genes with majority of these coding for proteins involved in photosynthesis and gene expression along with transfer rna  and ribosomal rna  genes  <cit> .

in contrast mitochondrial genomes are remarkably variable among land plants. these genomes are usually larger than plastid genomes, ranging from 105 kb in the moss physcomitrella patens <cit>  to  <dig>  mb in the angiosperm silene conica <cit> . despite their relatively large size, mitochondrial genomes contain fewer genes than their plastid counterparts; 37- <dig> different genes including protein coding, trna and rrna genes  <cit> . plant mitochondrial genomes map as circular or noncircular structures and have a dynamic, multipartite organization due to active recombination associated with repeat regions that can be as large as 109 kb in tripsacum dactyloides. rearrangements in plant mitochondrial genomes are facilitated by homologs of bacterial dna repair proteins such as reca and muts <cit>  and often result in chimeric open reading frames   <cit> . one of the most prominent characteristics of plant mitochondrial genomes is the presence of foreign dna including dna that has been transferred from the plastid, nucleus and even genetic material from other species . rna editing is common in plant mitochondrial genomes and usually involves the conversion of cytidine  to uracil   <cit> .

among angiosperms there is a high frequency of organellar dna transferred to the nucleus. although most functional gene transfers from organelles to the nucleus occurred shortly after their endosymbiotic origin, gene transfer is an ongoing process  <cit> . while transfer of organellar dna to the nucleus is rampant, acquisition of function is much less common. transferred organelle genes must acquire nuclear expression elements and target peptides to shuttle the gene product back to the organelle   <cit> . transferred organelle genes may acquire a novel targeting sequence or adopt one from an existing nuclear gene . in a few cases, mitochondrial genes have been transferred without the acquisition of n-terminal sequences. in these cases, gene products may be targeted to the mitochondrion by internal features of the polypeptide  <cit> .

this report provides the complete sequences of the plastid and mitochondrial genomes of r. stricta, a medicinally important species. genome organization is characterized including identification of the gene transfers between the mitochondria and the nucleus. in addition, the mitochondrial genome organization of r. stricta is compared to seven previously published asterid genomes to examine patterns of organelle genome evolution across this large angiosperm clade.

RESULTS
plastid genome organization of rhazya stricta
the r. stricta plastid genome is  <dig>  bp in length with a pair of inverted repeats  of  <dig>  bp separated by small and large single-copy  regions of  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp, respectively . the gc content is  <dig> %, and the genome consists of  <dig> % protein-coding genes,  <dig> % non-coding regions,  <dig> % trna and  <dig> % rrna genes. the rhazya plastid genome encodes  <dig> genes,  <dig> of which are duplicated in the ir, for a total of  <dig> genes. there are  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> trna and  <dig> rrna genes . the ir has expanded slightly at both the ir/lsc and ir/ssc boundaries relative to n. tabacum. the expansion encompassed the first  <dig> nucleotides of rps <dig> in irb, generating an rps <dig> fragment in ira, and extended into the ssc to include the stop codon of the ndhf gene. mitochondrial-like gene sequences were not detected in the rhazya plastid genome.figure  <dig>

mitochondrial genome organization of rhazya stricta
genome size and content
the r. stricta mitochondrial genome assembled into a single master chromosome of  <dig>  bp . the gc content is  <dig> %, and the genome consists of  <dig> % protein-coding genes,  <dig> % intergenic spacers,  <dig> % trna and  <dig> % rrna genes . the genome contains  <dig> genes including  <dig> protein-coding genes,  <dig> trnas, and  <dig> rrnas . two identical copies of the genes nad <dig>  ccmfc, rpl <dig>  rps <dig>  rps <dig> and rps <dig> were identified in two large repeats . the ribosomal protein genes rps <dig> and rps <dig> are absent and respiratory protein gene sdh <dig> appeared to be a pseudogene as it lacks a start codon. the rps <dig> gene has an 8 bp deletion near the 3’ end resulting in a frame shift that truncates the sequence relative to other angiosperms. the n-terminal portion of the atp <dig> gene is truncated, having lost  <dig> amino acids relative to the atp <dig> gene of nicotiana tabacum. the rhazya atp <dig> has only a small portion of the gene containing the conserved atp synthase f <dig> subunit  <dig> domain . the cox <dig> group i intron was identified as well as  <dig> group ii introns, six of which require trans-splicing .

repeat structure
blastn analysis of the rhazya mitochondrial genome against itself revealed  <dig>  bp of repetitive dna, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp in length . the repetitive dna constitutes  <dig> % of the genome including  <dig> % large ,  <dig> % intermediate  and  <dig> % small  repeats. mapping of corrected pacbio reads against the mitochondrial genome revealed conflicts between the pacbio reads and the assembled genome suggesting the existence of subgenomic circles ; the long pacbio reads spanned the junctions of the repeat regions in the assembled master chromosome. the conflicts were associated with two large repeats  and five intermediate-sized repeats  . most of the repeats clustered together sequentially in twos, threes or fives. pcr confirmed the existence of isomeric and/or subgenomic circles that arose as a result of repeat-mediated homologous recombination among the seven repeat families .

transposable elements
the rhazya mitochondrial genome contains  <dig>  bp  of transposable elements  of many different types  the majority of which are copia- and gypsy-like retrotransposons . most tes were identified in intergenic regions  with only  <dig>  bp  inserted into genic regions .figure  <dig>

open reading frames
one hundred twenty-three mitochondrial orfs  were identified in rhazya intergenic regions . blast searches against the non-redundant nucleotide and protein databases in the ncbi identified several orfs with high similarity to hypothetical proteins, some of which were cytoplasmic male sterile  related orfs, or were derived from intergenic regions of other plant mitochondrial genomes. other orfs contained sequences similar to organellar or viral dna and rna polymerases, retrotransposons or nuclear genes. the remaining orfs had no significant similarity to any genes or proteins in the ncbi database.

blastn queries of the rhazya transcriptome assembly  detected transcripts for many of the  <dig> orfs . one transcript had a sequence identical to a mitochondrial copy of a nuclear gene, -mandelonitrile lyase, which is present as split orfs in the mitochondrial genome of rhazya due to a 5 bp deletion relative to the nuclear gene . rt-pcr confirmed that the transcript has 100% sequence identity to the mitochondrial dna sequence, including the nonsense mutation.

twelve orfs of at least 150 bp in length, three of which are present as two copies, appeared to be chimeric orfs that contain small fragments  of mitochondrial genes . five of these orfs were predicted to encode one or two transmembrane helices. orf56b contains small fragments of the three mitochondrial genes, rpl <dig>  matr and ccmfn, that overlap with repeat  <dig> . two orfs are located in the region with three or four repeats that are associated with atp <dig> . while each of these two were predicted to encode a protein with two transmembrane helices, neither could be identified by a blastn search against annotated rhazya mitochondrial genes.

sequences of plastid origin
plastid-like sequences were found in  <dig> fragments throughout the rhazya mitochondrial genome, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp in length . the total amount of plastid sequence was  <dig>  bp, representing  <dig> % of the mitochondrial genome. the  <dig> insertion regions represent  <dig> % of the rhazya plastid genome. six intact plastid genes, ndhh, atph, psab , psaa , eight trnas , six pseudogenes and numerous partial genes and intergenic spacer regions were identified. all plastid fragments were located in intergenic regions. among the trnas, four differed by one to three nucleotide substitutions from copies in the plastid . there are two degenerate copies of trni-cau and trnp-ugg with six indels compared to the plastid-encoded trnas. plastid-derived trnm-cau was not detected in the rhazya mitochondrial genome.

mitochondrial rna editing
prep-mt and prepact predicted  <dig> and  <dig> putative c-to-u rna editing sites, respectively, in the  <dig> rhayza mitochondrial protein-coding genes . cytochrome c proteins and nadh dehydrogenase subunits  were more highly edited than other protein-coding genes, whereas ribosomal proteins had fewer edited sites. available transcriptome data for  <dig> genes  confirmed that of the  <dig> sites predicted by prep-mt for these genes,  <dig>  sites were edited . in the rhazya mitochondrial genome, atp <dig> and rps <dig> begin with an acg start codon instead of the standard atg. in the case of rps <dig>  prep-mt predicted that the start codon was altered by rna editing  to the standard atg codon, whereas the editing prediction for atp <dig> was only  <dig> . rna editing was also predicted to generate the stop codons in atp <dig>  atp <dig>  and rps <dig> .

characterization of putative functional gene transfers to the nucleus
all  <dig> protein-coding genes in the rhazya mitochondrial genome were used to query the rhazya transcriptome assembly . an orf with  <dig> % nucleotide sequence identity to the rps <dig> gene was identified that includes a 5’ extension of 162 bp . the first  <dig> amino acids of this orf were predicted by targetp to be an mtp , whereas predotar returned the prediction of ‘elsewhere’ . examination of a draft r. stricta de novo nuclear genome sequence  confirmed the presence of an intronless, nuclear-encoded rps <dig> gene showing 100% nucleotide sequence identity to the transcript . another copy of rps <dig> with  <dig> % nucleotide sequence identity was detected on the same scaffold approximately 150 kb from the first copy, however it lacks a proximal start codon and has four internal stop codons . phylogenetic analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial copies of rps <dig> showed that the rhazya mitochondrial copy did not group with other asterids but instead was positioned sister to the clade that includes nuclear copies from other angiosperms . however, support for this placement was very weak  and resolution of relationships among the mitochondrial copies was low. the two nuclear copies of r. stricta grouped together with high bootstrap support , and branch lengths on the tree indicate that the putative non-functional copy  has experienced much higher substitution rates . protein sequence alignment of the extended amino acids upstream from rps <dig> was highly divergent with very low identities between rhazya and seven other species, ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % . protein sequence alignment of the nuclear copy of rhazya rps <dig> to mitochondrial-encoded sequences from five species of seed plants showed pairwise identities ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, higher than the pairwise identity between the nuclear and mitochondrial rhazya rps <dig> copies at  <dig> % .figure  <dig>

the rhazya transcriptome assembly was queried with the sdh <dig> pseudogene sequence from the mitochondrial genome. a contig containing an sdh3-like orf with  <dig> % nucleotide sequence identity to the query sequence was detected . the orf included a 5’ extension of 555 bp and the first  <dig> amino acids of the orf were predicted by targetp  and predotar  to be an mtp. phytozome predicted a small heat shock protein  between the targeting presequence and the sdh <dig> coding region . examination of the draft r. stricta de novo nuclear genome assembly confirmed the presence of the nuclear-encoded sdh <dig> gene containing two exons totaling 960 bp separated by a 105 bp intron . phylogenetic analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial copies of sdh <dig> showed that the rhazya mitochondrial copy was nested within a clade of asterid mitochondrial copies and the nuclear-encoded copy grouped within a nuclear-encoded clade . protein sequence alignment of the predicted targeting presequence and the remaining sequence upstream from sdh <dig> was highly divergent with low amino acid identities between rhazya and five other species, ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> % . protein sequence alignment of the nuclear copy of rhazya sdh <dig> to nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded sequences from several species revealed low amino acid identities of  <dig> - <dig> % and  <dig> - <dig> %, respectively .figure  <dig>

comparison of rhazya mitochondrial genome to seven other asterids
mitochondrial genome sizes of the eight asterids range from  <dig>  bp in daucus to  <dig>  bp in asclepias . using blastn searches , rhazya was found to share more sequences  with asclepias, both coding and non-coding, than with other asterids . gc content across the eight genomes ranges from  <dig> % in boea to  <dig> % in daucus . only one colinear gene block was identified among the eight asterid genomes: rrn18-rrn <dig> .figure  <dig>

blastn searches of each mitochondrial genome against its plastid counterpart revealed that plastid derived sequences account for  <dig> - <dig> % of the eight asterid mitochondrial genomes . the number of trnas derived from plastids varies among the eight asterids, ranging from five in daucus to  <dig> in boea . all asterids examined share four  intact plastid-derived trnas. in addition to plastid-derived sequences, the eight asterid mitochondrial genomes contain  <dig> - <dig> % tes , most of which were ltr-retrotransposons . the percentage of tes in rhazya is the lowest among the asterids examined.

repetitive dna content among asterid mitochondrial genomes is highly variable, ranging from  <dig> % in boea to  <dig> % in daucus . all asterids had numerous small repetitive dnas , with the greatest number found in vaccinium . the mitochondrial genome of rhazya contains longer repeats, whereas daucus had a higher percentage of repetitive dna. repetitive dna is widely scattered across the eight asterid genomes, and each genome contains a unique pattern of repeats .figure  <dig>

discussion
organization of rhazya stricta organelle genomes
the r. stricta plastid genome is highly conserved with gene content and gene order identical to the ancestral genome organization of angiosperms  <cit> . the size of r. stricta plastid genome at  <dig>  bp is close to the median genome size for photosynthetic land plants  <cit> . a recent study found that the plastid genome of asclepias contains a  <dig>  kb segment of mitochondrial dna with an rpl <dig> pseudogene, and this transfer has been documented in other genera of the tribe asclepiadeae   <cit> . the rhazya plastid genome does not contain any mitochondrial-like sequences, confirming that transfer of mitochondrial dna into the plastid genome is restricted to a single tribe of apocynaceae. therefore, inter-compartmental transfers between the rhazya plastid and mitochondrial genomes have occurred in one direction only.

the r. stricta mitochondrial genome exhibits several complex evolutionary features, including a dynamic genome structure that has been shaped by repeat families and intramolecular recombination, invasion of the genome by both plastid and nuclear sequences, and the putative functional transfer of two genes to the nucleus. recombination between repeats has resulted in a master chromosome and multiple subgenomic circles . the r. stricta mitochondrial genome contains seven repeat families, including two large and five intermediate-sized repeats. these repeats are involved in homologous recombination in the rhazya mitochondrial genome. two distinct conformations of the master chromosome and six subgenomic circles have been confirmed by pcr , however additional chromosome configurations may be present in rhazya mitochondria. pcr recombination has been suggested as a complicating factor in utilizing this approach to confirm recombination among repeats in plant mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . however, the use of three different illumina libraries , the high depth of coverage , and corrected pacbio data provide additional confidence in the pcr results. recombination among the repeats may have influenced gene content by facilitating gene fusion and pseudogenization events  <cit> . for example, most mitochondrial genes of rhazya are highly conserved in length compared to other angiosperms except atp <dig>  this gene usually contains extended sequences at the n-terminus that are highly divergent across angiosperms even within species  <cit> . in most cases, atp <dig> is located at the border of repeat regions, suggesting that this gene is frequently involved in genomic recombination  <cit> . in rhazya only the atp <dig> conserved domain is present and is located downstream from repeat  <dig> . the n-terminal extended sequences of atp <dig> in rhazya may have been cleaved by genomic recombination activities upstream of the protein gene, but remnants of these extended sequences were not detected due to high sequence divergence and frequent recombination activities. two orfs  located within repeat families including repeat  <dig> have one of the diagnostic features of chimeric genes: the presence of a transmembrane domain  <cit>  . studies have shown that chimeric orfs containing a portion of atp synthase subunit are frequently associated with rearrangements in plant mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . the situation in rhazya supports a connection between atp synthase subunits and recombination in mitochondrial genomes.

twelve other potential chimeric orfs are present in the r. stricta mitochondrial genome. one of these, orf56b, has features of cms  <cit> , including fragments containing a portion of three mitochondrial genes , transmembrane helices and overlap with a second copy of repeat  <dig> . further work is needed to determine if these other orfs are functional and associated with genomic recombination.

plant mitochondrial genomes typically contain dna originating from plastid and nuclear genomes, and in some cases from other species including bacteria, viruses and plants . the rhazya mitochondrial genome contains considerable foreign dna, accounting for at least  <dig> % of the genome. plastid-derived sequences are variable in mitochondrial genomes of seed plants and account for 1-12%  <cit>  indicating that rhazya has an intermediate amount in its genome . the inserted plastid sequences of rhazya include full-length protein-coding and trna genes, most of which are presumed nonfunctional, but some trna genes may be candidates for functional transfer as reported for wheat and potato  <cit> . the absence of trnm-cau in rhazya is unusual among sequenced angiosperm mitochondrial genomes as previous phylogenetic analyses have suggested that transfer of trnm-cau to the mitochondrion occurred in the common ancestor of extant angiosperms  <cit> .

the rhazya mitochondrial genome also contains numerous nuclear-derived sequences, most of which are transposable elements  . most of the tes are located in intergenic spacers but  <dig> are found in genes . previous studies have only observed tes in intergenic spacers reviewed in  <cit>  but in some cases searches for tes were limited to these regions see reference  <cit> . in addition to tes, the rhazya mitochondrial genome contains two sequences homologous to the nuclear gene encoding -mandelonitrile lyase. one copy of the sequence is nearly complete and the presence of a transcript with 100% sequence identity to this copy suggests that it is expressed. previous studies have shown that some angiosperm mitochondrial genomes contain fragments of nuclear protein-coding genes  <cit> , however the assembled transcriptome contig and rt-pcr result refute a functional role for this gene in rhazya mitochondria. the presence of internal stop codons in the transcript suggests that it is likely a product of relaxed transcription in mitochondria  <cit> .

the rhazya mitochondrial genome has acquired the intron cox1i <dig>  which is commonly the subject of horizontal transfer across angiosperms  <cit> . this intron in rhazya is highly similar  to introns from eight other genera of apocynaceae. sanchez-puerta et al.  <cit>  suggested six independent gains of this intron in the apocynaceae. two alternative hypotheses for the cox <dig> intron were suggested: stochastic loss and horizontal transfer  <cit> . the dynamics of cox <dig> intron gain or loss within the apocynaceae requires further study to better understand its evolutionary history in the family.

mitochondrial gene transfer in rhazya genomes
rhazya contains  <dig> of the  <dig> protein-coding genes that are found in the ancestral angiosperm mitochondrial genome  <cit> . two ribosomal proteins, rps <dig> and rps <dig>  that are absent in rhazya have been lost from the mitochondrial genomes of nearly all core eudicots  <cit> . the third gene, sdh <dig>  has been lost numerous times across angiosperms  <cit>  and appears to be a pseudogene in rhazya. analyses of the transcriptome and a draft nuclear genome of rhazya facilitated identification of putative functional copies of sdh <dig> and rps <dig> in the nucleus.

rhazya sdh <dig> has been transferred to the nucleus and has acquired a mitochondrial targeting presequence as well as one intron and a portion of chaperonin gene hsp <dig> . previous studies have identified  <dig> independent transfers of sdh <dig> to the nucleus in angiosperms, and in all cases mitochondrial targeting presequences were acquired from preexisting nuclear genes  <cit> . a previous study reported putative functional transfers of sdh <dig> in five other asterid families, asteraceae, convolvulaceae, ericaceae, lamiaceae and orobanchaceae  <cit> . this previous report, combined with the phylogenetic distribution of sdh <dig> loss from the mitochondrial genomes of sequenced asterid genomes , indicates that this gene has been transferred to the nucleus multiple times in this clade.

in case of the rhazya rps <dig>  two copies were identified in the nucleus. one copy has a mitochondrial targeting presequence and is likely functional while the second copy is likely non-functional considering its level of divergence from the putative functional copy . there are at least three alternative explanations for the origin of two nuclear copies: 1) rps <dig> was transferred to the nucleus and after acquiring the mitochondrial targeting presequence it was duplicated, followed by the loss of the targeting presequence in one copy; 2) the gene was duplicated after transfer and only one copy acquired a targeting presequence; or 3) there were two independent transfers of rps <dig> to the nucleus and only one of the copies acquired a targeting presequence. phylogenetic analyses support a single transfer of rps <dig> to the nucleus  but it is not possible with available data to discern between alternatives one and two. a previous study showed that the rps <dig> coding sequence has been transferred to the nucleus independently at least three times in grasses and that mitochondrial rps <dig> pseudogene transcripts are expressed  <cit> , although this may be due to the well-known phenomenon of relaxed transcription in mitochondria  <cit> . although rhazya mitochondrial rps <dig> has a deletion at the 3’ end causing a frameshift mutation, the gene may retain functionality as it is nearly full length relative to other angiosperms . moreover, the mitochondrial copy lacks nonsense mutations and transcriptome data showed that the mitochondrial rps <dig> is co-transcribed with rpl <dig>  as a reported for tobacco  <cit> . following transfers to the nucleus, the co-existence of putative functional nuclear and mitochondrial gene copies has been suggested for only three genes among angiosperms, including cox <dig> in some fabaceae  <cit> , rpl <dig> in triticum <cit> , and sdh <dig> in populus <cit> .

evolutionary comparisons among asterid mitochondrial genomes
comparing the mitochondrial genome sequences of rhazya with the seven other asterids and two representative non-asterids provides insight into the distinct evolutionary events that have occurred across this clade. genome sizes vary  <dig> -fold among the asterids and the rhazya genome represents an intermediate size within the asterid i lineage . no clear correlation is seen between repetitive dna or te content and genome size among asterid mitochondrial genomes, whereas the amount of transferred plastid dna tends to scale with genome size. for example, repetitive dna content is highest in rhazya, but asclepias is the largest genome despite its  <dig> -fold lower repetitive dna content than rhazya . likewise, although daucus has the second highest repetitive dna content, it is the smallest genome among the eight asterids . the asterid mitochondrial genomes also differ in the structure and complexity of their repeats. rhazya, nicotiana, mimulus, helianthus and daucus have large repeats, in contrast to the other asterids. these genomes display diverse patterns of repeats that appear to facilitate recombination and can range in size from short  to long  within a single species.

there are very few colinear clusters of genes across the eight asterid mitochondrial genomes, which likely reflects the very different patterns of repeats that have caused rearrangements . overall, this comparison indicates that asterid mitochondrial genomes have contrasting evolutionary histories, resulting in very diverse organization and gene content. a better understanding of the evolutionary history of recombination among asterid mitochondrial genomes requires genome sequences for more taxa and comparisons of nuclear genes encoding dna repair and recombination proteins including reca-like recombinases, muts homologue  <dig>  the whirlies and other organellar single stranded dna-binding proteins that have been implicated in maintenance of genome stability  <cit> .

the phylogenetic distribution of gene and intron losses and te insertions revealed some shared and many independent events across asterids . most mitochondrial gene loss/pseudogenization events involve ribosomal proteins and sdh genes, as in other angiosperms  <cit> . the two protein-coding genes rps <dig> and rps <dig> were lost in the ancestor of eudicots  <cit> . the presence of the intron cox1i <dig> in the rhazya/asclepias clade and boea suggests that it was gained independently twice in the asterid clade since this intron was lost in the ancestor of angiosperms  <cit> . the asterid i lineage shares the loss of the intron nad7i <dig>  indicating that this loss occurred in the common ancestor of the clade. the loss of the intron cox2i <dig> in rhazya, asclepias and nicotiana, and the loss of two genes  and two introns  in boea and mimulus indicate that these events occurred in the most recent common ancestor of each clade. in case of the mimulus rpl <dig>  the phylogenetic distribution suggests that this gene became pseudogenized after the intron was lost in common ancestor of the boea/mimulus clade. the asterid ii clade has lost four genes, three ribosomal proteins genes and one sdh gene. the phylogenetic distribution of rps <dig> among asterids suggests that this gene was transferred to the nucleus in the common ancestor of the rhazya, asclepias and nicotiana clade. the fate of the gene was different in the three species; it has been lost in asclepias, pseudogenized in nicotiana while both the mitochondrial and nuclear copies are likely functional in rhazya. the duplication event of nuclear rps <dig> within the asterid i clade is likely more complicated and will require more nuclear genome data to resolve. there are a number of shared gains of tes within genic regions across asterids . all asterids examined share the same tes in the same location except for the te in the cox <dig> gene. this suggests that nearly all tes were transferred in the ancestor of the asterid clade. the cox <dig> te insertion in rhazya and nicotiana differ in size  and te class .

CONCLUSIONS
organelle genomes of rhazya stricta, a member of the asterid i clade, provide important information for improving the understanding of mitochondrial genome evolution among angiosperms. the mitochondrial genome exhibits a number of phenomena that have been observed in other species  <cit> , including the presence of recombinogenic repeats that generate a multipartite organization with a master chromosome and subgenomic circles, a high incidence of transferred dna from the plastid and nuclear genomes, and gene transfers from the mitochondrion to the nucleus. the organellar genomic sequences, combined with nuclear transcriptome and genome data, have enabled a rigorous examination of these events. rhazya is unique among the eight sequenced asterids in the types of events that have shaped the evolution of its mitochondrial genome. the organelle genomes of r. stricta provide valuable genomic resources for utilizing this important medicinal plant in biotechnology applications.
