BACKGROUND
clostridium thermocellum is a gram-positive, anaerobic, thermophilic bacterium that produces large extracellular enyzme complexes, called cellulosomes. it can rapidly solubilize biomass and it is a candidate microorganism for converting biomass into lignocellulosic ethanol via a process termed consolidated bioprocessing  , and ethanol concentrations between  <dig> to 50 g/l only inhibited the growth of different strains  by approximately 50%
 <cit> . however, increased ethanol tolerance and productivity are not necessarily linked, with the highest concentrations of ethanol produced reported as ≤ 30 g/l
 <cit> . membrane integrity has been recognized as a key factor in ethanol tolerance
 <cit> . in addition, the role of compatible solutes such as trehalose, amino acids, such as proline
 <cit> , in ethanol tolerance and specific genes  have been investigated in a variety of microorganisms.

differences in membrane proteins between c. thermocellum wild-type and ethanol-adapted  strains have been investigated using proteomics
 <cit> . timmons et al.  determined the fatty acid composition and membrane anisotropy from c. thermocellum wild-type and ea strains. they reported that ea had more fatty acids with chain lengths >16: <dig> and significantly more 16: <dig> plasmalogens compared to the parent and proposed a model that strain ea ethanol tolerance is due to fatty acid alterations that increase membrane rigidity and counter-act the fluidizing effect of ethanol
 <cit> .

genome resequencing was conducted for c. thermocellum ea and a mutated alcohol dehydrogenase gene  with altered cofactor specificity was identified as a key genetic determinant for the enhanced ethanol tolerance phenotype
 <cit> . subsequently, two independent ethanol tolerant c. thermocellum mutants named e50a and e50c were selected using a strategy that alternated between increasing ethanol concentrations and transfers in medium that lacked selection pressure
 <cit> . in contrast to strain ea, strains e50a and e50c grew as well as or better than the wild-type strain and similar to strain ea the mutations were identified in an alcohol dehydrogenase gene by resequencing. common mutations were also identified in genes involved in arginine/pyrimidine biosynthetic pathways.

a detailed fundamental understanding of biological systems under standard and altered environmental conditions is important for metabolic engineering, synthetic biology, and to advance applied goals for enhanced biofuels production
 <cit> . in this study, we combined transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolic profiling with bioinformatic analyses to elucidate the molecular responses of wild-type c. thermocellum to ethanol stress compared to untreated control samples. the combined approach, which employs three of the major “omic” technologies, endeavors to provide a deep and global insight into the molecular mechanisms of c. thermocellum ethanol stress responses. though each analytical technology is powerful in its own right, the application of orthogonal “omic” measurements provides additional support for conclusions put forth in this study and provides avenues for future studies into the different aspects of physiology and regulation captured by the respective technologies.

methods
controlled batch fermentations
c. thermocellum atcc <dig> was cultured in chemically defined mtc medium with 5 g/l of cellobiose as the carbon source, as described previously
 <cit>  at 60°c. batch fermentations were conducted in approximately  <dig>  l of mtc medium in  <dig> -l bioflo <dig> bioreactors  fitted with agitation, ph, and temperature probes and controls, as described previously
 <cit> . fermentors were sparged overnight with filter-sterilized n <dig> gas and for approximately one hour post-inoculation to maintain anaerobic conditions. the agitation rate was 300 rpm in each vessel. culture ph was monitored using a ph electrode  and the ph control set point was maintained at ph  <dig>  by automatic titration with 3 n naoh or hcl. c. thermocellum was added to a serum bottle containing 50 ml mtc broth for inoculation. the optical density was measured with a spectrophotometer at 600nm and the inoculum was added to one fermentor for the seed culture, and the culture from the seed culture fermentor was used to inoculate three fermentors to an initial od600nm of approximately  <dig> . two fermentations were conducted for the wild-type c. thermocellum controls  or  <dig>  g/l  ethanol shock treatment. growth was monitored turbidometrically by measuring optical density  at 600nm with a model  <dig> spectrophotometer . samples were harvested at approximately mid-exponential phase  and at different time points post ethanol shock.

extracellular metabolite analysis with high-performance liquid chromatography 
hplc analysis was used for the measurements of the extracellular metabolite concentration of cellobiose, acetate, and ethanol in  <dig>  μm-filtered samples taken at different time points during fermentation, as described previously
 <cit> . the fermentation samples were acidified with 10 mm sulfuric acid, separated and quantified by hplc using a lachrom elite system . analysis was performed with the oven  set at 60°c, and a pump  set with a flow rate of  <dig>  ml/min in 5 mm h2so <dig>  the run time for each sample was set for 35 min . eluted compounds were registered and quantified by a refractive index detector  equipped with a computer-powered integrator. soluble fermentation products were identified by comparison with retention times and peak areas of corresponding standards. metabolites were separated on an aminex hpx-87 h,  <dig> x  <dig>  mm column .

rna extraction and ds-cdna synthesis
rna was isolated essentially as described previously
 <cit> , except that an additional bead beating step was included for efficient gram-positive cell lysis. briefly, samples were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in trizol reagent  and subsequently  <dig>  ml aliquots were transferred  <dig>  ml screw cap tubes  that contained  <dig>  g of lysis beads from a ultraclean microbial rna kit . cell lysis proceeded with  <dig> x  <dig> sec bead beating treatments at  <dig>  rpm in a precellys  <dig> high-throughput tissue homogenizer . cell lysates were transferred to fresh tubes and subsequently purified as described previously
 <cit> . each total rna preparation was treated with rnase-free dnase i  to digest residual chromosomal dna and subsequently purified using the rneasy mini kit . total cellular rna was quantified with a nanodrop nd- <dig> spectrophotometer  and rna quality was assessed with agilent bioanalyzer . purified rna of high quality was used as the template to generate ds-cdna using invitrogen ds-cdna synthesis kit .

microarray sample labeling, hybridization, scanning, and statistical analysis of array data
ds-cdna was labeled, hybridized, arrays washed, and scanned following the nimblegen protocols. hybridizations were conducted using an 12-bay hybridization station , arrays dried using a maui wash system  and scanned with a surescan high-resolution dna microarray scanner , and the images were quantified using nimblescan software . statistical analyses were done with jmp genomics  <dig>  software , essentially as described previously
 <cit> . the data were normalized using the lowess normalization algorithm within jmp genomics. an analysis of variance  was performed to determine differential expression levels between conditions and time points using the false discovery rate  testing method . microarray data have been deposited in ncbi gene expression omnibus  database under accession number gse <dig>  the interactions among differentially expressed genes were investigated using the string  <dig>  pre-computed database
 <cit> , available at
http://string.embl.de/.

quantitative-pcr  analysis
microarray data were validated using real-time qpcr, as described previously
 <cit> , except that the bio-rad myiq <dig> two-color real-time pcr detection system  and roche faststart sybr green master  were used for this experiment. eleven genes representing different functional categories and range of gene expression values based on microarray hybridizations were analyzed using qpcr from cdna derived from different time point samples. oligonucleotide sequences of the eleven genes selected for qpcr analysis are listed in additional file
 <dig> 

intracellular metabolite analysis with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry 
culture samples were rapidly pelleted by centrifugation, supernatants removed, cell pellets snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80°c until analysis. krall et al.  conducted a rigorous comparison of sampling approaches for microbial cultures and concluded that fast filtering and centrifugation  produced similar concentrations of metabolites, even for those predicted with high turnover
 <cit> . metabolite analyses were performed on microbial pellets collected in different time points suspended with 80% ethanol , as described previously
 <cit> . briefly, cells were disrupted using a sonicator  <dig> . an internal standard of  <dig> μl of sorbitol  was then added to each tube and 2-ml aliquots then dried in a helium stream. metabolites were converted to trimethylsilyl derivatives and analyzed with an agilent technologies inc.  5975 c inert xl gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer, fitted with an hp-5ms  30 m x 250 μm x  <dig>  μm film thickness capillary column, as described previously
 <cit> . two biological samples from each condition were analyzed with metabolite data of c. thermocellum under control and ethanol treatment conditions averaged and presented as relative responses between c. thermocellum under ethanol treatment versus c. thermocellum without ethanol treatment fermentation. statistically significant treatment differences were determined by students t-tests with probability values p <  <dig>  shown.

sample preparation for 2d-lc-ms/ms
c. thermocellum pelleted cells from time point 120 min were prepared for lc-ms analysis as follows. cells were lysed by a combination of sds , sonic disruption at 20% amplitude , and boiling, followed by centrifugation at 21000 g for 10 min. crude lysates were assayed for protein concentration via bicinchoninic acid assay , , adjusted to 50 mm dithiothreitol , and incubated at 60°c for 10 min. trichloroacetic acid  precipitation of 2 mg of crude protein was performed to remove bulk sds and other small molecules that could potentially interfere with downstream ms measurement. pelleted protein was washed twice with ice-cold acetone, air-dried to remove residual acetone, and resuspended in  <dig> μl of denaturation buffer . denatured proteins were then reduced with 5 mm dtt for 10 min at room temperature , alkylated with 10 mm iodoacetamide  for 10 min at rt in the dark, and diluted to 4 m urea for tryptic digestion. proteins were digested overnight at a 1: <dig> trypsin to protein ratio , and again in 2 m urea for 4 h the following day. resulting peptides were then adjusted to 150 mm nacl,  <dig> % formic acid, filtered through a 10 kda spin column filter , and quantified by bca for subsequent lc-ms analysis.

multi-dimensional lc-ms analysis of peptides
peptide samples were directly loaded onto a biphasic mudpit back column packed with 4 cm strong-cation exchange  resin followed by 3 cm c <dig> reversed phase  resin , as previously described
 <cit> . adsorbed peptides were washed offline with solvent a  for 20 min, followed by a 25 min gradient to solvent b . the back column containing the peptides was placed in-line with an ltq-xl ms  outfitted with an in-house pulled nanospray emitter  packed with 15 cm of c <dig> rp material. peptides were separated in two chromatographic dimensions  over an 11-step mudpit analysis . tandem mass spectra  were acquired in data-dependent mode based on full-range mass scans . two technical replicates were analyzed per sample.

database searching and semi-quantitative proteomics data analysis
tandem mass spectra collected for each sample were matched to specific peptide sequences via sequest
 <cit>  utilizing a fasta protein database containing c. thermocellum  and common contaminant protein entries, as well as reversed decoy sequences to assess false-discovery rates. as iaa was used to block the reformation of disulfide linkages, a static modification present at all cysteine residues  was utilized. sequest-derived peptide sequence data were then filtered with dtaselect
 <cit>  and assembled into protein loci using the following score thresholds: xcorr: +1 =  <dig> , +2 =  <dig> , +3 =  <dig> , deltcn  <dig> , and  <dig> peptides  per protein identification. these criteria were chosen to produce average protein-level fdrs between  <dig> and  <dig> percent. dtaselect-filtered data for each sample run were then prepared for semi-quantitative analysis. before calculation of normalized spectral abundance factors 
 <cit> , spectral counts  of non-unique/redundant peptides were weighted based upon the relative abundance of the proteins that share these sequences, as derived by their total unique spc. once rebalanced, nsaf values were calculated for each protein and imported into jmp genomics  <dig>   for data normalization, clustering, and significance testing. proteomics data can be accessed at:

RESULTS
the time point in mid-exponential growth at which ethanol was added into the treatment fermentors was designated as “ethanol-shock” or “time zero”. samples are either referred to as “control” for untreated control fermentations or “treatment” or “ethanol treatment” for those derived from fermentations that received  <dig>  g/l  ethanol at “time zero”.

c. thermocellum growth response to ethanol and extracellular metabolite profiles
culture turbidity, as measured by od <dig> units, for the ethanol-treatment fermentors prior to ethanol shock was similar to the control fermentors  . the culture densities for both the treatment and control conditions increased during the “omics” sampling period , however the supplementation of ethanol negatively influenced c. thermocellum growth and cellobiose consumption . the maximal culture density over the experiment for the control fermentors was od <dig>  <dig>  ±  <dig> , which occurred 4 h after time zero. in contrast, the maximal cell density for the treatment fermentors was od <dig>  <dig>  ±  <dig> , 6 h post ethanol treatment. the culture density for both the treatment and control decreased as cells entered late stationary phase.

hplc was used to quantify and compare the kinetics of extracellular substrate  consumption, and extracellular end-product  formation. the final cellobiose concentrations were similar between the ethanol-treated and control cells . however, the cellobiose consumption rate was reduced from  <dig>  g/l/h in the absence of ethanol to  <dig>  g/l/h after ethanol treatment. ethanol production was correlated with the cellobiose consumption . at the conclusion of the experiment the ethanol concentration in control fermentations was approximately  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l. in contrast, ethanol supplementation halted its production in the treatment fermentors and there was a slight decrease in net ethanol concentration to about  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l after ethanol treatment. in addition, the acetate production rate was reduced by half, from  <dig>  g/l/h to  <dig>  g/l/h, with the supplementation of ethanol. however, the final concentration of acetate was slightly higher in the ethanol-treated cells  than that of control cells . lactate was also produced during the experiment, with the majority being produced after cellobiose was largely consumed. the highest lactate concentration was found in the ethanol-treated cells , compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l for the control cells.

intracellular metabolomic profiles reveals a reduction in glutamic acid and accumulation of sugar phosphates
the physiological status of c. thermocellum was investigated further by gc-ms analysis of the intracellular metabolomic profiles from time zero and at different time points post ethanol-shock . metabolomic analyses indicated that there were few relative metabolite responses  that were significantly different at different time points with the number of replicates used in this study . ethanol-treated cells indicated a decline in glutamic acid, with it being reduced to 19% of the controls as early as 30 min after ethanol shock. the only other significant response in an amino acid was a  <dig> -fold increase in phenylalanine within the ethanol-treated cells that occurred at 240 min . these responses were accompanied by a doubling of sugar phosphates, including glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate that were significant at  <dig> and 120 min post treatment, whereas glucose-1-phosphate was unaffected . the substrate cellobiose tended to be relatively higher in the ethanol-treated cells. the only other significant response was a  <dig> -fold increase in 3-phosphoglyceric acid in the ethanol-stressed c. thermocellum compared to that of untreated cells; accumulating at 240 min, but was not significantly different earlier .

transcriptomic profile of c. thermocellum in response to ethanol
global view of ethanol response
gene expression profiles for the control and ethanol-treated fermentations were generated from samples harvested at time zero,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 240 min post ethanol-shock using nimblegen microarrays. we identified significantly differentially expressed genes by comparing the gene expression profiles of treated cells to that of control cells at the same time points, as well as the time-course gene expressions for control cells or ethanol-treated cells separately. in the absence of fold-change filtering, more than three thousand genes were significantly differentially expressed in at least one of the multiple comparisons covering nearly all  <dig>  predicted c. thermocellum genes, , which is consistent with a recent report that detected expression for  <dig>  c. thermocellum genes when the cells were grown in either cellulose or cellobiose limited chemostats
 <cit> .
 <dig> 

eleven differentially-expressed genes from the treatment versus control comparison representing different functional categories and a broad expression range were selected for real-time quantitative pcr  confirmation . correlation coefficient values of r2 =  <dig>  and  <dig>  were obtained for comparisons between microarray and qpcr for the time points of  <dig> and 120 min, respectively , which indicated microarray data were of good quality.

in this study,  <dig> genes showed high levels of expression with normalized expression intensity values ≥  <dig>  and  <dig> genes with relatively low expression intensity  across all conditions . many phage- or sporulation-related genes and those with unknown function were among genes that had low expression levels . in contrast, genes that were expressed at higher levels were related to cellulosome components, protein synthesis including ribosomal proteins, electron transfer components, and energy metabolism and a small portion of genes of unknown function were also highly expressed . nearly all the  <dig> protein-coding genes in the abundant subset were represented in the proteome, with only  <dig> that were not detected at 120 min post-shock . in contrast, only  <dig> proteins of the  <dig> protein-coding genes expressed at low levels were detected .

ethanol responsive genes based on treatment versus control comparisons
when ethanol-treated cells were compared to control cells at the same time points, i.e. 2 min ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 240 min,  <dig> genes were significantly differentially expressed with at least a 2-fold change . immediately after ethanol-shock, the cells responded promptly by regulating their gene expression such that after only 2 min,  <dig> genes were significantly differentially expressed with at least a 2-fold change . at 12 min post ethanol-shock, expression levels for nearly 13% of the predicted genes were significantly different, while at  <dig> and 60 min post-shock about  <dig> genes  were differentially expressed . the number of genes expressed differently between ethanol-treated cells and control cells was reduced when the cells began to adapt to the ethanol stress condition. there were  <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes at the time points of  <dig> and 240 min post ethanol-shock, respectively . a c. thermocellum alcohol dehydrogenase  with altered cofactor specificity has been identified as a key genetic determinant for enhanced ethanol tolerance in a mutant strain
 <cit> . in this wild-type study, differential adhe expression was not a predominant response and cognate treatment/control differences were always <  <dig> fold , supporting the earlier study that indicated a change in adhe co-factor specificity was important for ethanol tolerance rather than the adhe over-expression
 <cit> .

the dynamics of ethanol responsive gene expression
out of the  <dig> significantly differentially expressed ethanol-responsive genes , approximately half were up-regulated and approximately half were down-regulated ≥ 2-fold in at least one time point comparison. an overview of how different comparisons and the effect of using different fold change stringency is presented . nine genes were constantly up-regulated and three genes were constantly down-regulated at least 2-fold . the nine genes constitutively up-regulated with ethanol treatment had functions in amino acid transport and metabolism, including glutamine synthetase catalytic region , glutamine amidotransferase , urease gamma subunit , diaminopimelate epimerase , and a predicted urea abc transporter operon containing five genes from cthe_ <dig> to cthe_ <dig> . another seven genes were also constitutively up-regulated by ethanol treatment, except their ratios were less than 2-fold when compared to the earliest time point of 2 min . however, some of them clustered together and belong to same predicted operons of nine constitutively up-regulated genes as discussed above . these seven genes were therefore included as constitutive ethanol up-regulated genes. the three constitutively ethanol down-regulated genes include a hypothetical protein-signal peptide  and two genes belonging to the ech hydrogenase operon . another gene  in this predicted operon was also down-regulated at all time points, but at time points  <dig> and 240 min log <dig> based ratio differences were − <dig>  and − <dig> , respectively, and these values did not meet the stringent criteria . a predicted operon adjacent to the hypothetical gene cthe_ <dig> contained five genes  related to spermidine/putrescine abc transporter was also constitutively down-regulated except that the ratios were less than 2-fold at only one time point .

ethanol responsive genes based on time course comparison and their interactions
temporal gene expression between the control or treatment condition were used to identify the ethanol responsive genes and exclude those that may be more related to growth-phase. these are presented as supplemental data and comprise of  <dig> core ethanol-responsive genes .

a hierarchical clustering analysis of these  <dig> core ethanol-responsive genes partitioned the temporal profiles into four clusters, each of which were further analyzed using the strings  <dig>  database of pre-existing interactions
 <cit>  . the first cluster  included  <dig> genes, with the majority of these constitutively up-regulated with ethanol treatment . cluster  <dig> contained  <dig> genes that were mostly up-regulated, especially in earlier time points after ethanol treatment. cluster  <dig> was represented by  <dig> genes that were regulated dynamically across the post-shock time course and cluster  <dig> had  <dig> genes that were down-regulated upon ethanol treatment. the  <dig> genes within cluster  <dig> encode products related to urea utilization and likely its uptake, as well as a cysteine synthase homolog  and a nitrogenase homolog , and contain most of the genes for five predicted operons 
 <cit> . cluster  <dig> contains genes related to crispr and other hypothetical functions . most gene products in cluster  <dig> are likely involved in substrate translocation and amino acid biosynthesis . ethanol down-regulated genes in cluster  <dig> are related to energy metabolism, and include genes for hydrogeneases, electron transport, cellulosome components, ribosomal protein synthesis, and a member of the laci family of transcriptional regulators, amongst others. . in summary, expression of genes participating in amino acid transport and metabolism were induced by ethanol, whereas the ethanol down-regulated genes primarily belonged to the categories of translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis .
 <dig> and clustering was conducted using jmp genomics.

proteomic profile of c. thermocellum in response to ethanol
shotgun proteomics was carried out using the 120 min control and treated cell samples to measure the terminal time point in the ethanol stress/control comparison and to ascertain the overall impact on the final set of proteins and enzymes. more than thirteen hundred proteins were identified, which represents the largest number of c. thermocellum proteins detected to date . of these,  <dig> proteins exhibited a ≥  <dig> -fold and significant change  in abundance . forty-two proteins were more abundant within ethanol-treated cells, with three specific to only ethanol-treated cells at the 120 min time point . the corresponding gene expression profiles for ethanol-specific proteins were also found to be significantly up-regulated  and included three genes  belonging to a predicted seven gene operon related to nitrogen metabolism . ethanol up-regulated proteins also included several other proteins related to nitrogen metabolism, such as glutamine synthetase .

array significance determined by p-value  and a significant array different is represented by a  <dig> in the array sig index column and a  <dig> is not considered significantly different for a given gene at this time point comparison.

thirty-five down-regulated proteins following ethanol treatment included three that were specific to the control, but only one of these  trended similar to the microarray data  . of the other  <dig> ethanol down-regulated proteins, only one exhibited a change  in gene expression  .

adhe was detected and it showed significant upregulation  after treatment, but only at low levels  . in general, smaller differences in relative protein abundance levels were observed for proteins that were more prevalent within the cells, compared to those that had few spectra normalized counts  . a bivariate fit of relative fold changes  for the 120 min proteomics and transcriptomics profiles generated a correlation coefficient of r2 =  <dig> .

ethanol effect on expression for cellulosome components
there are greater than 70 c. thermocellum cellulosome related proteins
 <cit>  . microarray results indicate that cellulosome genes were up-regulated, especially in the earlier time points  and that the most dramatic changes occurred within 12 min post-shock . at 120 min post-shock, about forty cellulosome proteins were detected by proteomics , and none of these proteins were identified as differentially expressed. hierarchical clustering identified thirteen cellulosome component genes  that had high levels of constitutive expression for both control and treatment conditions, and similarly high protein abundances . in the case of cipa and cels, recent genetic studies have affirmed their importance in cellulose degradation
 <cit>  and they are among the most highly c. thermocellum expressed genes with cellulose or cellobiose substrates in chemostat culture
 <cit> .

twelve cellulosome related genes with low levels of gene expression were not detected via proteomics, and these are primarily dockerin components. in addition, within the  <dig> ethanol-responsive genes, six cellulosome genes were defined as ethanol-responsive . only one gene cthe_ <dig>  was down-regulated, although this result was not reflected by proteomics at 120 min time point . five ethanol-induced genes were cthe_ <dig> , cthe_ <dig> , cthe_ <dig> , cthe_ <dig> , and cthe_ <dig> , which were up-regulated at earlier stages and had no or few peptides detected following ethanol treatment .

nine genes have been reported to be related to cellulosome regulation as anti-sigma factors recently 
 <cit> . cthe_ <dig> has been examined for its carbohydrate-binding and enzymatic performance of the gh <dig> module and the possibility as a biomass sensor
 <cit> . in this study, the microarray results indicated only cthe_ <dig> as an ethanol-responsive gene under the conditions used in this experiment and it was down-regulated after ethanol treatment , but not detected by proteomics. however, two other proteins  were detected by lc-ms/ms but only at low, non-quantifiable levels . the cellulosome components with high gene expression levels had no significant differences between control and treatment at 120 min post-shock. differences in gene expression were primarily from genes with low expression values.

ethanol effect on carbon metabolism, glycolysis and pyruvate catabolism
in our proteomic study, proteins related to glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism were among the most abundant that were detected and had the greatest number of normalized spectral counts compared to other proteins identified . forty proteins were detected that had total normalized spectral counts  greater than  <dig>  in either condition, and fifteen of them were related to glycolysis, pyruvate catabolism and central metabolism, including cthe_ <dig> , cthe_ <dig> , cthe_ <dig> , cthe_ <dig> , cthe_ <dig> , fe hydrogenases cthe_0341- <dig> and cthe_0429- <dig>  iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenase cthe_ <dig>  bifunctional acetaldehyde-coa/alcohol dehydrogenase cthe_ <dig>  nadp-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase cthe_ <dig>  malate dehydrogenase cthe_ <dig>  and pyruvate flavodoxin/ferredoxin oxidoreductase complex genes cthe_ <dig> and cthe_ <dig> .

growth and metabolomic data indicated that the ethanol shock arrested cell growth and led to the intracellular accumulation of the substrate  as well as its glycolytic intermediates, i.e. glucose-6-p, fructose-6-p, and 3-p-glycerate . transcriptomic data were consistent with metabolomic results, as several genes  related to glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism were down-regulated in the ethanol treatment condition, as well as the pta  and ack  genes for acetate production .

ethanol effect on nitrogen metabolism
urea abc transport components were up-regulated after ethanol treatment at the gene  and protein levels  , which likely facilitates c. thermocellum urea uptake in this experiment . the urease gene cluster  was also up-regulated after ethanol stress and is likely responsible for converting accumulated urea into ammonia for anabolism . there was less glutamate within the ethanol-treated cells compared to that of control cells . genes related to glutamate-specific aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis, such as glutamyl-trna synthetase, glutaminyl-trna synthetase, and aspartyl/glutamyl-trna amidotransferase were relatively less abundant and down-regulated with the ethanol treatment . genes related to glutamate metabolism, however, were up-regulated with the ethanol treatment. for example, genes encoding the glutamine synthetase  were always up-regulated in ethanol-treated cells compared to control cells. other glutamate metabolism related genes such as glutamate dehydrogenase  were also up-regulated in the ethanol treatment condition. cthe_ <dig> was the most abundant transcript related to glutamate metabolism . in accordance with the transcriptomic data, the proteomic data indicate that the same genes related to glutamate metabolism  were also up-regulated after treatment .

discussion
ethanol stress inhibits glycolysis
after ethanol treatment, culture growth was slowed but not completely halted under ph controlled conditions . nutrient exhaustion or a decrease in ph from acid formation have been suggested as more important factors in growth inhibition than direct end-product accumulation
 <cit> . rydzak et al.  have shown that changes in enzyme activities in response to exogenous end product additions  did not correlate with final end-product yields and suggested that end-product yields may be governed by thermodynamic considerations.

the rate of acetate production, whose biosynthesis generates an atp
 <cit> , was reduced by about one half in the treated cultures and having less atp available likely contributed to lower growth rates for the treated cultures . however, the final concentration of acetate was not dramatically different between the treated and control fermentations at the end of the experiment . likewise, final net ethanol concentrations  were similar between conditions and in keeping with prior studies
 <cit> .

in this study, we examined the impact of ethanol addition on metabolism. glycolysis and pyruvate catabolism were arrested after ethanol treatment, which led to the accumulation of the substrate cellobiose and glycolytic intermediates within the ethanol-treated cells  and end-product formation was linked to cellobiose consumption, as has been observed previously
 <cit> . enzymes involved in glycolysis and pyruvate catabolism were among the most abundant proteins identified in both the control and ethanol-treated cells , indicative of their pivotal role in cellular metabolism
 <cit> . in this study, we assayed the relative abundances and correlations of many important c. thermocellum genes, proteins, and metabolites for the first time. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , phosphoglycerate kinase , fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate aldolase , and bifunctional acetaldehyde-coa/alcohol dehydrogenase  had the greatest number of normalized spectral counts relative to other detected proteins. though highly abundant, these enzymes did not show large, significant differences and many showed no significant differences between the ethanol treatment and control samples at 120 min post ethanol stress . the overall correlation  between array and proteomics was in keeping with previous studies for different microorganisms
 <cit>  .

several key genes involved in the glycolysis pathway were down-regulated upon addition of ethanol, although their values were less than the 2-fold cut-off value and were thus not included in the significantly differentially expressed ethanol-responsive gene list . we did not investigate allosteric regulation in this study. inhibition of glycolysis would lead to less reducing power  being available for downstream electron transport and ethanol production. the decrease in ethanol production and reduced electron flux may generate insufficient nad+ to ensure normal cellular metabolism. cells may overcome this deficiency with lactate biosynthesis generating more nad+, which may also explain the increase of lactate production from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l in control cells to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g/l in ethanol-treated cells to in this study.

hydrogenases and energy metabolism
carbon and nitrogen metabolism were affected by ethanol stress and proteins related to electron flow were also impacted. there is surprising diversity amongst clostridial hydrogenases, and a better understanding of hydrogenases will facilitate their application and manipulation for bioenergy requirements
 <cit> . c. thermocellum atcc  <dig> contains six hydrogenases, a nife energy converting hydrogenase and five fefe containing enzymes
 <cit> . transcription of nife and fefe hydrogenases in c. thermocellum has been confirmed by rt-pcr
 <cit> .

most fefe hydrogenases were up-regulated in response to ethanol shock, except for a hydrogenase encoded by cthe_0340- <dig> . in contrast to hydrogenase cthe_ <dig>  other fefe hydrogenases were growth-phase dependent and down-regulated in the stationary phase, which is consistent with earlier data
 <cit> . interestingly, the fe only hydrogenase subunit cthe_ <dig> contains a glutamate synthase binding domain. cthe_ <dig> is a putative ferredoxin containing a nadph binding domain and a pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase binding domain
 <cit> , and was induced with ethanol treatment. the hydrogenase subunits  and the nadph-dependent glutamate synthase cthe_ <dig> showed similar profiles, being all up-regulated by ethanol and with lower abundance within cells under the conditions used in this study .

the multi-subunit membrane-associated nife hydrogenase complex  is encoded by the cthe_3019- <dig> genes, which were repressed by the ethanol treatment dramatically and the response occurred rapidly after ethanol shock . the differential expression of these hydrogenase genes may indicate that they play a role in rebalancing the cells redox state after ethanol stress. except for subunit eche  that had only a few spectra assigned, no peptides were detected for the remaining five subunits in 120 min post-shock . the hydrogenase assembly and maturation genes  are adjacent to nife hydrogenase and form a putative operon with cthe_ <dig> . the cthe_3013- <dig> genes were also down-regulated in response to ethanol shock, and except for hydrogenase accessory protein hypb  with  <dig> spectra detected, other hydrogenase accessory proteins were not detected in the proteomic studies in 120 min post-shock . the lack of spectra may indicate a limitation in detection of these membrane proteins.

recently, a genome-scale metabolic analysis of c. thermocellum for bioethanol production has been reported
 <cit> , and the in silico metabolic modeling results indicated that the deletion of nine non-essential genes affecting redox balance or acetate production could possibly increase ethanol production. of these, seven genes are involved in energy metabolism and redox balance, including the potential operon rnfcdgeab and hydrogenase cthe_3003
 <cit> . in this study, the rnf type membrane-associated nadh:ubiqinone oxidoreductase rnfcdgeab encoded by a potential operon 
 <cit>  was also down-regulated with ethanol treatment and the response was instantaneous . except for subunit a , all other subunits were detected by lc-ms/ms. an association of rnfcdgeab with the nife hydrogenase for energy generation is further suggested by their co-expression patterns in this study. differential expression for genes such as cthe_ <dig>  and cthe_ <dig>  may indicate pathways to rebalance energy and requirements for new amino acids although further studies are required .

nitrogen assimilation and metabolism
bacteria are able to use a range of different nitrogen compounds, depending upon environmental availability and cellular requirements. in the case of industrial, solvent-producing clostridium species, the source of nitrogen affects solvent yield and when nitrogen deficient molasses replaced historical corn mash as a feed stock, nitrogenous compounds had to be added to the fermentation
 <cit> .

in this study, genes involved in nitrogen metabolism were among the most significantly up-regulated after ethanol treatment. the majority of urea abc transport  and urease  genes were significantly up-regulated immediately post-shock and remained high, relative to the control, at all remaining points in the time course . staphylococci aureus urease genes have also been reported to show greater expression following ethanol stress and play a key role in pathogenesis
 <cit> . here, urea was provided as a major nitrogen source in the medium likely triggered the urea abc transport and urease gene expression upon stress conditions. the high levels of differential gene expression for genes involved in nitrogen metabolism may indicate a requirement for biosynthesis of new amino acids. media composition and engineering urease genes in thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum were reported to be among the most important parameters for strain improvement
 <cit> , which may point to future directions for c. thermocellum improvements for biotechnology.

glutamate was depleted in ethanol-treated cells soon after ethanol addition and glutamine synthetases , both at the gene and protein levels , were up-regulated following ethanol stress. in contrast, glutamyl-trna and glutiminyl-trna synthetase genes were down-regulated. lc-ms/ms proteomics identified several proteins related to glutamine metabolism, for example cthe_ <dig>  cthe_ <dig>  cthe_ <dig>  cthe_ <dig>  cthe_ <dig> and cthe_ <dig>  however only carbamoyl-phosphate synthase large chain  <dig>  was up-regulated by ethanol treatment. it is possible that a major fraction of glutamine may flow into the biosynthesis of carbamoyl-p, leading to changes in pyrimidine metabolism as well as arginine and proline metabolism. furthermore, the aspartate carbamoyltransferase gene  was also induced with the ethanol treatment, with gene expression up-regulated in the early time point of 12 min post-shock and then down-regulated . c. thermocellum ethanol tolerant mutant strains have been found with nonsynonymous snps in cthe_0953
 <cit> . in this study, proteomics data indicated an increased abundance of cthe_ <dig>  within the ethanol-treated cells, which may also lead to synthesis of building blocks through aspartate . urea cycle intermediates and urea are known to react with ethanol and form inhibitory compounds
 <cit> . cthe_ <dig>  and cthe_ <dig>  had similar levels between control and treatment. up-regulation of the cthe_ <dig>  cthe_ <dig> and cthe_ <dig> genes and the possible absence of asparagine  synthesis from aspartate therefore may provide the aspartate substrate for the down-stream n-carbamoyl-l-aspartate synthesis. the extent to which c. thermocellum is rebalancing its metabolism in response to ethanol specifically or as a general stress response can likely be answered best by examining other c. thermocellum stress responses.

CONCLUSIONS
the inhibition of glycolysis and pyruvate catabolism, together with the induction of nitrogen uptake and metabolic genes indicates that c. thermocellum redirects carbon and nitrogen flux to generate required building blocks to overcome cell arrest and reestablish growth. further work is needed to examine the cross talk between carbon and nitrogen metabolism and access to newly developed c. thermocellum genetic systems will facilitate these analyses in the future. these data will assist others as they begin to examine respective transcript and protein levels in c. thermocellum metabolic engineering, considering useful promoters as an example. a greater number of systematic and more detailed studies that examine physiology at various “omics” levels are required to realize the potential application of synthetic biology approaches in important microorganisms such as c. thermocellum.
