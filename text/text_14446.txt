BACKGROUND
the human body contains almost  <dig> proteases  <cit>  that are involved in a number of important biological pathways such as blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, complement activation, hormone production and digestion  <cit> . these proteases are often essential players in elaborate networks, or cascades, where zymogens  are activated in order to activate a downstream zymogen or digest/inactivate a structural or biologically active protein. proteases therefore tend to have highly specific substrate repertoires and are regulated by endogenous protease inhibitors, with a delicate balance between these counteracting forces. an imbalance between active proteases and protease inhibitors may cause, or contribute to, many diseases. a classical example is hereditary deficiency of α <dig> proteinase inhibitor , that can lead to early-onset emphysema  <cit> . this process is greatly accelerated upon smoking, partly because antitrypsin is susceptible to inactivation by oxidation by cigarette smoke and because neutrophil elastase, a potent protease with a broad substrate specificity including lung elastin, is up-regulated and released from neutrophils by nicotine. similarly, the progression of some severe diseases can be successfully slowed down with the use of protease inhibitors. proteases are consequently important drug targets  <cit>  and the list of protease inhibitors approved for clinical use is steadily growing, including drugs to treat, e.g., hypertension, thrombosis, pancreatitis, periodontitis, respiratory diseases, cancer, hiv/aids and probably soon hepatitis c  <cit> . however, the road to success has been paved with numerous failures, because of many unexpected  side effects. an ideal protease inhibitor should have a well defined substrate specificity, broad enough to treat the disease efficiently, but narrow enough not to interfere with other proteases or biological processes, combined with low toxicity to the host cells. hiv- <dig> protease has an important function for virus maturation during hiv infection, but its substrate specificity is complex and endogenous protease inhibitors of the host cells infected with hiv do not seem to be able to stop its action. therefore, artificial hiv- <dig> protease inhibitors are needed and have been in clinical use for hiv/aids treatment for over a decade. among other viral targets, the hepatitis c virus  ns <dig> protease is also a candidate target for antiviral drugs, since currently available hcv therapy is effective in only half of the patients and limited by serious side effects  <cit> .

a challenge in the hunt for better protease inhibitors is to make maximum use of available experimental protease data and provide accurate rules for the substrate specificity, rules that can be used to estimate the effect of proteases in biological pathways. there are three important criteria that should be met by these specificity rules: they should be accurate in terms of out-of-sample prediction; they should be comprehensible ; and they should have a high fidelity to the data from which they were extracted. the aim of the present work was to present a method for extracting cleavage rules from viral protease data. a method that provides rules that meet these three criteria better than previously presented approaches. the method is exemplified on hiv- <dig> and hcv ns <dig> protease data sets.

the structure of cleavage rules
the first step towards meeting the three requirements above  is to understand how cleavage rules are typically formulated. rules that are expressed in the standard form are probably more likely to be comprehensible, and they may even be more accurate if the standard form has developed over time so that people have included their knowledge of how protease cleavage works into these rules.

cleavage specificities tend to be described assuming that certain positions should contain certain amino acids. common terms used are "consensus motif"  and "sub-site preference" , where the latter refers to those amino acids that seem to match the active site in the protease, and sub-site preferences are typically illustrated with specificity profiles or histograms showing the frequency of amino acids in the different positions of cleaved substrates. this assumption is evident in the rules used for different proteases in the tools peptidecutter and peptidemass on ; they are all expressed as lists of allowed  amino acids in the positions of the peptides .

the tradition of expressing cleavage rules in this fashion may not be a coincidence, and a rule extraction method that explicitly produces conjunctive rules may therefore be the right way to go for these problems.

conjunctive rules are rules that are formulated as lists of requirements that must all be true . using conjunctive rules puts no restriction on the possible cleavage specificities that can be described; conjunctive rules can be combined with the logical or function into any logical rule. this is the so-called disjunctive normal form theorem  <cit> .

a very simple cleavage rule is, e.g., the arg-c proteinase cleavage rule  <cit> . it cleaves peptides on the c-terminal side of arginine . this is expressed as

  

using the standard schechter and berger notation  <cit>  where the substrate sites are denoted by ...-p3-p2-p1-p1'-p2'-p3'-..., with the scissile bond located between p <dig> and p1'.

an effective immune response of the human host against a viral attack involves the generation of virus-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes , whose main function is to kill virus-infected cells. the two important countermeasures used by the ctls are perforin/granzyme mediated apoptosis and fas-mediated apoptosis. granzyme b, a member of the hematopoietic serine protease superfamily, is stored in granules of cytotoxic t cells and natural killer cells and has a requirement for aspartate  in the p <dig> position  <cit> . however, the full rule is a conjunctive rule that involves more positions  <cit> :

  

which means that it cleaves on the c-terminal side of the sequence iepd, isoleucine-glutamate-proline-aspartate , i.e. all four positions must have specific amino acids in them for cleavage to occur.

each position can also allow a set of amino acids, as is the case for the bovine coagulation factor, factor xa  <cit> :

  

this means that position p <dig> should be occupied by any of {a,g,i,l,t,v,m}, but nothing else, that position p <dig> should be occupied by any of {d,e}, but nothing else, that p <dig> should be occupied by g, and that p <dig> should be occupied by r for cleavage to occur .

there are also proteases that have more than one rule, e.g. if there are two types of cleavages that occur. this is the case for thrombin  <cit> , which has the following two cleavage rules:

  

and

  

the notation for positions p1' and p2' means that cleavage will not occur if aspartate  or glutamate  are in any of those positions.

combinations of conjunctive rules can also be used to describe cleavage rules if there are interactions and competitions among the positions. assume for instance a cleavage site with two nearby positions  with preference for hydrophobic amino acids, e.g. l, m, f, y . assume also that it is impossible to fit both positions with f or y at the same time  but that it is sufficient that one of them is present in one of the two positions. this would lead to a set of two conjunctive rules

  

and

  

to conclude, conjunctive rules follow the notation used in standard tools for describing cleavage of peptides and they can be used to describe any type of rule. if conjunctive rules can be used to produce cleavage rules that are simpler but as accurate as those from other methods that do not follow the standard notation, then that would speak in favour of a conjunctive rule approach.

RESULTS
data
hiv- <dig> protease data
you et al.  <cit>  collected a hiv- <dig> protease substrate data set containing  <dig> octamers, of which  <dig> are cleaved and  <dig> are non-cleaved. in this data set, the octamer sqnyaivq was originally erroneously labeled as non-cleaved  <cit> . this error was corrected and the resulting data set is referred to as the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set in this study. the octamers are denoted p4-p3-p2-p1-p1'-p2'-p3'-p4'.

kontijevskis et al.  <cit>  collected a substantially larger hiv- <dig> protease substrate data set containing  <dig> octamers, where  <dig> are cleaved and  <dig> are non-cleaved. this data set also has the wrong label for sqnyaivq, which we corrected. the corrected data set is referred to as the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set in this study.

the similarity between the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> and the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data sets is very high since they were partly collected from the same literature sources. there are  <dig> octamers that are common between the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> and the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data sets. of these, seven are labeled differently in the two data sets: aaamssai, arvlaqam, grinvalv, sgvfsvng and sgvyqlsa are labeled as cleaved in the  <dig> data set and as non-cleaved in the  <dig> data set; aeamsqvt and frsgvett are labeled as non-cleaved in the  <dig> data set and as cleaved in the  <dig> data set.

recently, schilling and overall  <cit>  collected an even larger set of peptides cleaved by hiv- <dig> protease. this set was published after the rules described herein were constructed and can thus be used as independent test data. a set of octamers was generated from this data in the following way: cleaved octamers were taken from all peptides that contained at least four residues on the prime and the non-prime sides of the scissile bond; non-cleaved octamers were generated by sliding a window of size eight residues on both sides of the scissile bond  if the prime or the non-prime side had at least eight residues. for example, schilling and overall  <cit>   report the cleaved peptide pllggslmeyailsaiaamnepk, where the cleavage site is between y and a. this produces the cleaved octamer lmeyails and the non-cleaved octamers pllggslm, llggslme, lggslmey, ailsaiaa, ilsaiaam, lsaiaamn, saiaamne, aiaamnep and iaamnepk. peptides that had an ambiguous p <dig> residue or that were marked "excluded" in tables nineteen and twenty in the supporting material to their paper  <cit>  were removed.

the final data set contains  <dig> octamers, of which  <dig> are cleaved and  <dig> are non-cleaved. we refer to this as the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set.

there is no overlap between the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> and the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data sets. there are twenty common octamers in the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> and the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data sets, of which two are in conflict . there is only one sequence in the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set that differs by one position from any octamer from any sequence in the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> or hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data sets. this sequence is gwvlgehg, which is labeled as cleaved and differs in one position from the cleaved gwilgehg in the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> and hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data sets. there are two sequences in the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set that differ in two positions from sequences in the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set: the cleaved arvlfdal, which is similar to the non-cleaved apvlldal in the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set, and the cleaved gwilaehg, which is similar to the cleaved gwvlgehg in the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set. there are four sequences in the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set that differ in two positions from sequences in the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set: the non-cleaved nkillael, vdklvsag and teekikal, which are similar to the non-cleaved octamers nkvnlael, vdvlvssg and tedkinal, and the cleaved octamer gwilaehg that differs in two positions from the cleaved gwvlgehg in the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set. all other sequences in the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set differ in at least three positions out of eight from any octamer in the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> or the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data sets.

it is also relevant to check how many sequences in the data sets that have identical residues in the most important positions in the octamer: p2-p1-p1'-p2'. about 92% of the octamers in the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set are identical, in the four central positions, to sequences in the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set. however, only 7% of the octamers in the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set match to sequences in the hiv- <dig>  <dig> data set. about 41% of the octamers in the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set are identical to sequences in the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set, but only 7% of the octamers in the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set match sequences in the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set. about 1% of the sequences in the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set match to sequences in the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set, and 4% match to sequences in the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set.

there is thus very little sequence similarity between the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set and the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> or the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data sets, while there is a lot of sequence similarity between the two smaller data sets. the smaller data sets are used to extract cleavage rules, which are then tested on the larger  data set.

hcv protease data
we initially intended to use a hcv ns <dig> protease data set used previously by other researchers  <cit> . there were, however, several uncertainties and conflicts between this data set and available references on hcv ns <dig> cleavage  <cit> , which made us doubt the quality of this data set. a new hcv ns <dig> data set was therefore created from scratch from the references. a procedure described by  <cit>  was followed to generate  <dig> additional non-cleaved decamers by moving a ten residue window over the 4b, 5a and 5b non-structural proteins  <cit>  of the hcv polyprotein , excluding the cleavage sites themselves since they were already in the data set. the 4a part was excluded since it is a protease co-factor. the decamers are of the form p6-p5-p4-p3-p2-p1-p1'-p2'-p3'-p4', i.e. the cleavage occurs between position six and seven in the decamer. the final hcv ns <dig> data set contains  <dig> decamers, of which  <dig> are cleaved and  <dig> are non-cleaved. we denote this data set the hcv ns <dig> data set.

the hcv ns <dig> data set is quite different from the data set used in previous rule extraction studies  <cit> : 8% of the decamers that occur in both sets are labeled differently.

three separate out-of-sample test data sets for hcv were created. the ns <dig> protease itself  was used to generate one test data set with  <dig> decamers, of which none are in the hcv ns <dig> data set. this test data set was intended for comparison with reported internal cleavage sites in the ns <dig> protease  <cit> . four proteins from the tlr <dig> pathway were used for another test data set: iκb kinase ε  ; traf family member-associated nf-κb activator-binding kinase  <dig>  ; toll-like receptor  <dig>  ; and toll-il- <dig> receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing ifn-β  . these four proteins have been tested for hcv ns <dig> cleavage by li et al.  <cit> . the four proteins produced a total of  <dig> decamers, of which one is also in the hcv ns <dig> data set . a third test data set was made up of  <dig> in vivo tested ns <dig> substrates from kim et al.  <cit> , none of which are in the hcv ns <dig> data set. the three out-of-sample test sets are denoted ns <dig> internal, tlr <dig>  and ns <dig> in vivo, respectively.

artificial data
two artificial data sets were created to measure the orthogonal search-based rule extraction  method's ability to extract rules of the form that we are looking for. the data sets were designed using conjunctive rules to mimic typical cleavage rules as described in the introduction.

the two artificial rule sets are shown in table  <dig>  the simpler problem  was modeled partly after the thermolysin  <cit>  specificity, as described for the peptidecutter tool. four positions were used instead of the minimum two in order to see how well osre could deal with irrelevant information. the more complex problem  was modeled after the thrombin  <cit>  specificity, as described for the peptidecutter tool. training peptides from data set a were sampled randomly. training peptides from data set b were picked with balanced sampling . this was done because the random probability for observing a cleaved peptide for data set b is very low.

any amino acid could occupy the two first positions in artificial data set a . one letter amino acid abbreviations are used. the sign ∈ means "in" and the sign ∉ means "not in". the rules are connected with the boolean and operator, which means that all position rules must be true for cleavage to

hiv- <dig> protease
rule extraction
rules for the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> and hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data sets were extracted using osre, as described in the methods section. osre produced slightly different numbers of rules for each cross validation  subset, varying between  <dig> and  <dig> rules for the  <dig> peptide data set and between  <dig> and  <dig> rules for the  <dig> peptide data set. the cv generalization error was estimated for the rules when one, two, three, four, five and all rules were used to predict cleavage for the hold-out cv data set ; this cv error is shown in figure  <dig> and figure  <dig>  the  <dig> peptide set is a bit more difficult to predict because it is a balanced data set with fewer negative examples than the  <dig> peptide set. the cv performance improves until five rules are used . the cv prediction accuracies of the osre method when using all rules are 87% for the  <dig> peptide data set and 93% for the  <dig> peptide set.

the fidelity is measured by using the rules to label the peptide data sets from which they were generated. the osre consensus rules, produced by using spectral clustering on the osre rule sets , are listed in table  <dig>  these consensus rules were used to label the hiv- <dig> pr peptides in the data sets and the resulting in-sample accuracy  is shown in table  <dig>  table  <dig> also lists, for reference, the fidelities for rule sets generated using the rough set theory approach  <cit> .

out-of-sample tests
the osre rules' prediction accuracy was tested on the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set. this data set was published after the rules were extracted and there is almost no sequence overlap with the data set used to generate the rules. it therefore constitutes a true out-of-sample test of the rules' ability to predict cleavage for novel sequences. however, the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data set has many more non-cleaved octamers than cleaved octamers; the prediction accuracy is almost 87% if all sequences are predicted as non-cleaved . the prediction accuracy is therefore not a good quality measure for the performance of the rules, it is better to present the sensitivity , specificity , and positive likelihood ratio. these are defined as:

   

   

   

the positive likelihood ratio measures how much better the odds of correctly predicting a cleavage location with the rule set are than predicting randomly according to prevalence.

the sensitivity and specificity are usually shown together in a so-called receiver operator characteristic  curve. the roc plots for the osre hiv- <dig> rules are shown in figure  <dig> and figure  <dig>  together with the same values for the rough set theory rules  <cit> , the recently published hivcleave web-server  <cit> , and a linear support vector machine  <cit> , which was the best predictor we had hitherto tried for this problem. the positive likelihood ratio is shown in table  <dig>  together with corresponding sensitivity and specificity values.

hcv ns <dig> protease
rule extraction
the osre method was applied to the hcv ns <dig> data in a corresponding way as for the hiv- <dig> pr data. the cv out-of-sample error as a function of the number of rules is shown in figure  <dig>  the accuracy when using all rules is 95%. this is close to the performance of a non-rule-based linear support vector machine classifier with tuned "slack", which has an accuracy of 97%, and it is the hitherto best result using a rule based method for hcv ns <dig>  the consensus rules for hcv ns <dig> protease are listed in table  <dig>  their fidelity, shown in table  <dig>  is similar to the out of sample accuracy .

out-of-sample tests
applying the hcv rules to the ns <dig> protease sequence  produces  <dig> predicted internal cleavage sites, which are listed in table  <dig>  these can be compared to observed internal cleavages for the ns <dig> protease  <cit> .

the table shows the result of applying the hcv ns <dig> cleavage rules to the ns <dig> protease amino acid sequence. only decamers that are predicted to be cleaved are listed. the first column mentions the amino acid and the position in the ns <dig> sequence that occupies the p <dig> position in the decamer. the second column lists the decamer. the third column shows which hcv ns <dig> rules that the decamer matches to. the fourth and fifth column show the molecular masses of the cleavage products if ns <dig> is cleaved in that position.

yang et al.  <cit>  report two internal cleavages of ns <dig> which are cleaved by the ns <dig> protease itself together with the ns4a co-factor. these are hlifch-skkk  and vsvipt-sgdv . the latter of these is predicted by the hcv rules . the first one is not predicted to be cleaved but the nearby cleavage rhlifc-hskk  is predicted. it is probably also the correct cleavage site .

kou et al.  <cit>  tested the internal cleavages at hlifch-skkk  and vsvipt-sgdv for sensitivity to genotype. they found that the latter cleavage had genotype specificity, i.e. ns <dig> protease from hcv-1b could not cleave ns <dig> protease from genotype hcv-2a, and vice versa. the hcv rules predict the same; ns <dig> from genotypes hcv-1a and hcv-1b is predicted to be cleaved at this site by the hcv rules, but not ns <dig> from genotypes hcv-2a, hcv-2b or hcv-2c.

hou et al.  <cit>  report an alternative cleavage of ns3/4a, which can be observed when the wild type ns3/4a cleavage site is mutated so that it is not cleaved. they estimate that the alternative cleavage site  is located about  <dig> kda upstream from the wild type cleavage site, based on their observations of two  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda fragments that appear when the wild type cleavage site is mutated, but they were unable to find the location of the alternative cleavage site although they tested to mutate sites that were  <dig> kda upstream from the ns3/4a cleavage site  <cit> . it is therefore not possible to test whether the hcv rules would match this site. however, we can predict the possible cleavage sites under the assumption that the hcv rules are correct. it is peculiar that hou et al. report observed masses for the ns <dig> and the ns3-ns4a complex which are larger  than their molecular masses . it is possible that the reason is that there was something extra  sitting on the n-terminal side of the cloned ns3+ns4a complex, which was not cleaved off. this means that one should look for ns <dig> cleavage fragments of about  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda . if this is correct then the alternative cleavage site could be in any of four positions : c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> or c <dig> 

the hcv rules predict at least two correct cleavage sites , no false negatives and  <dig>  true negatives for the ns <dig> internal test data. this indicates an out-of-sample specificity  of 93% and a sensitivity  of 100%  for the hcv rules.

the hcv rules produce  <dig> possible cleavage sites on the tlr <dig> test data set . of these, only one is a verified cleavage site, psstp-csahl in ticam- <dig>  <cit> , which matches a decamer in the hcv ns <dig> data set. none of the remaining  <dig> decamers match any decamers in the hcv ns <dig> data set. thus, there are   <dig> false positives and  <dig> true negatives. this indicates an out-of-sample specificity of 2609/ = 93%, which agrees with the estimate from the ns <dig> internal test data.

kim et al.  <cit>  performed an in vivo determination of hcv ns <dig> substrate specificity, using a genetic assay that produces random sequences based on the ns4b/5a cleavage site in hcv. they list  <dig> decamers that are especially good substrates for ns <dig> in vivo. table  <dig> shows these  <dig> decamers  and how they match the hcv rules. only one of the  <dig> decamers does not match any hcv rule. most of the other decamers match the rule hcva and many match more than one rule. this indicates an out-of-sample sensitivity of 68/ = 99%, which agrees well with the estimate from the ns <dig> internal test data.

the table shows the result of applying the hcv ns <dig> cleavage rules to the  <dig> decamers listed as especially good substrates in vivo by kim et al.  <cit> . the first and third column show the decamers and the second and fourth column show the hcv rules that it matches . the last  sequence , marked with , is the consensus sequence tested by kim et al., this sequence is already in the hcv ns <dig> data set and is thus not an out-of-sample prediction.

if the estimates of sensitivity and specificity are correct, then the positive likelihood ratio for the osre hcv rules would be  <dig> 

discussion
the artificial data
the results on the two artificial problems illustrate two things. first, osre quickly finds rules that are very close to the generating rules in terms of classification accuracy. secondly, where an identified rule is not completely correct but the correction refers to rare events, then many examples are needed before the rare cases are represented in sufficient number to affect the performance ranking of the rule set and hence generate the required update.

the difficulty with artificial data set b lies in the very low probability for observing false positives once the rule  has been learned. for example, the training data set with  <dig>  observations has  <dig>  positive examples and  <dig>  negative examples. all the positive examples  match the rule but only  <dig> of the negative examples  match the rule and are thus counterexamples that point to that the rule must be modified.

in summary, osre finds a very good rule already with  <dig> samples and is able to find the corrections to this rule from a mere additional  <dig> false positives in the case of data set b. this must be considered a very good performance.

hiv- <dig> pr data
the rough set theory approach uses several physicochemical properties for the amino acids and one might believe that this should produce a better model than just using letter codes. the results here, however, indicate that this is not at all the case; conjunctive rules with simple amino acid letter codes are shorter, better predictors, and have higher fidelity to the data. also, the osre method is fast; it will produce a small  rule set for the data in this study in the matter of minutes .

the osre rules for positions p <dig> and p1' are the most consistent rules and agree with earlier findings  <cit>  for hiv- <dig> pr: large hydrophobic residues are preferred in position p <dig> and hydrophobic residues are preferred in position p1'. the osre consensus rules and the rough set rules do not agree completely. the rough set rules for cleaved peptides have, e.g., p <dig> ∈ {c} which does not occur very often in the osre consensus rules. another difference is p1' ∈ {d,c,k} for the rough set rules but not for the osre rules. we cannot with certainty say whether the osre or the rough set rules are more correct, but the fact that the osre rules have a higher fidelity to the data sets indicates that the osre rules would be more correct.

the hiv- <dig> protease cleavage rules based on the  <dig> data set, listed in in table  <dig>  require at least four residues to be specified for cleavage. this is different from kontijevskis et al.  <cit> , who find that three specified residues are sufficient. however, this is probably not a significant difference .

it is difficult, and hardly worthwhile, to compare the osre results for the hiv- <dig> pr data with other earlier rule extraction approaches, e.g.  <cit> , except the rough set rule method. earlier results have been based on a much smaller data set  and tend to refer to single amino acids in single positions and not groups of amino acids.

the two rules that agree most for the hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> and hiv- <dig> pr  <dig> data sets are hiva <dig> and hiva2; 76% of the octamers that match hiva <dig> also match hiva <dig> and 69% of the octamers that match hiva <dig> also match hiva <dig>  see table  <dig>  it is therefore reasonable to create a new consensus sequence by building a joint rule from hiva <dig> and hiva <dig>  i.e. a rule that describes all octamers that match both hiva <dig> and hiva <dig>  this consensus sequence is x-x- - - - -x-x, where x denotes any amino acid. the sensitivity, specificity and positive likelihood ratio for this consensus sequence, when evaluated on the hiv- <dig>  <dig> pr data set, are 28%, 99% and  <dig>  respectively. no other predictor is as accurate as this at this sensitivity level . it is notable that the consensus sequence only considers positions p2-p1-p1'-p2', i.e. not the full eight residue sequence.

 there are  <dig> possible octamers.

the fractions of these octamers that match to each osre hiv- <dig> rule, and to more than one rule, are shown here. the diagonal elements in the table show the fraction of the possible octamers that match one rule. the off-diagonal elements in the table show what fraction of the octamers that match both rules.

hcv ns <dig> data
a cysteine  in position p <dig> is considered to be the most important determinant for cleavage by hcv ns3/4a  <cit> . this is only reflected in the rule hcva; the other rules are much less specific about the p <dig> position. urbani et al.  <cit>  conclude that the specificity is quite broad unless for the requirement for a small hydrophobic residue  in position p <dig>  the osre hcv rule set indicates that the cysteine in position p <dig> is the dominating cleavage process: 10% of all decamers match the rule p <dig> ∈ {t,c}, 9% of all decamers match the rule hcva and about 11% of all decamers match any of the osre hcv rules. this means that roughly 80% of the decamers that are cleaved by hcv ns <dig>  match the rule hcva.

the standard hcv ns3/4a cleavage rule  <cit>   is much more specific than the osre hcv rules; only  <dig> % of all possible decamers match this standard rule. kim et al.  <cit>  suggest an even more restrictive cleavage rule  based on their in vivo studies: . only one in eight million decamers match this consensus sequence. none of the decamers studied by kim et al.  <cit> , except the one they handcraft to fit, match their consensus sequence.

none of the osre hcv rules support p <dig> ∈ {e,d} and p1' ∈ {a,s}. thus, it cannot be said that the osre hcv rules are in strong agreement with previously reported consensus sequences. however, the osre hcv rules are more accurate at predicting the cleavage sites. they are dominated by hcva and hcvc, which together match about 10% of all decamers, see table  <dig>  the two rules have quite a small overlap, 7% of the decamers that match hcva also match hcvc, and 6% of the decamers that match hcvc also match hcva . this indicates that there are two different processes taking place, one described by hcva and the other described by hcvb and hcvc, which have a higher overlap. the contribution from hcvd is quite small and it can probably be ignored.

there are  <dig> possible decamers. the fractions of these decamers that match to each osre hcv ns <dig> rule, and to more than one rule, are shown here. the diagonal elements in the table show the fraction of the possible octamers that match one rule. the off-diagonal elements in the table show what fraction of the decamers that match both rules.

the positive likelihood ratio for the osre hcv rules is estimated to be  <dig> / ≈  <dig>  which is the same as for the hiv- <dig> pr consensus sequence, but the sensitivity is much higher for hcv ns3/4a than for hiv- <dig> pr.

it was mentioned in the result section that we believe the internal cleavage of ns <dig> to be at c <dig>  and not at h <dig>  that yang et al.  <cit>  report. there are two reasons for this. one is that the hcv rules match one site and not the other. the other reason is that the experimental data presented by yang et al. fits also with a cleavage at c <dig>  they  <cit>  test their predicted location of the cleavage site by several pairwise mutations in the hcv polyprotein: ...rhlifchskkkc... → ...rhlpgchskkkc... ; ...rhlifcpgkkkc... ; ...rhlifchskpgc... ; and ...rhlifchskkpg... . yang et al. note that the internal cleavage is blocked when the mutation is pns34a-m <dig>  whereas the internal cleavage occurs in all other cases. these observations are perfectly consistent with cleavage at c <dig>  if the rule hcva is correct.

it is not worthwhile to compare the osre hcv rules to previous automated rule extraction  work on hcv ns <dig> protease since these have been based on a data set with many errors in it.

the hcv ns <dig> problem seems to be easier than the hiv- <dig> pr problem. fewer rules are required and the osre ns <dig> rules are more accurate than the osre hiv- <dig> pr rules.

CONCLUSIONS
a methodology that combines the osre rule extraction method and spectral clustering was introduced for efficiently, i.e. quickly and accurately, extracting accurate and comprehensible specificity rules for proteases, rules that also had a high fidelity to the data used to create them. the approach was demonstrated on two medically important protease cases, hiv- <dig> protease and hcv ns3/4a protease. the hiv- <dig> protease rules were shown to be more accurate than previous state-of-the-art rule extraction results on a large hiv- <dig> protease out-of-sample test data set. the proposed methodology achieved this performance using fewer rules than previous approaches and with a higher fidelity to the data set that had been used to create the rules.

the hcv ns3/4a protease rules were shown to fit very well with experimental findings for the hcv ns <dig> protease. the rules were used to correct the position of an internal cleavage site in hcv ns <dig>  which demonstrates the usefulness of accurate and comprehensible rules when interpreting experimental data.

the results indicate that the hcv ns3/4a protease cleavage is a simpler problem than the hiv- <dig> protease cleavage.

in summary, the osre approach yields rules that are simpler and more accurate than other rule extraction methods for protease specificity problems, and it is significantly faster. it does so by using conjunctive low-order rules, i.e. rules with few arguments and in a form that is commonly used to describe protease specificities.
