BACKGROUND
plants, being sessile are incessantly confronted by different environmental stresses, which include drought, high salinity, and extreme temperature, affecting both biomass productivity and grain yield of crops. to cope with such adverse multiple stresses, diverse molecular and physiological mechanisms have been evolved by the plant kingdom in general and a plant species in particular. therefore, it is indispensable to comprehend the specific mechanism of responses by any crop species to such stresses, with the ultimate aim of improving crop performance. rice , being one of the most important cereal crops, feeds more than half of the world population and is adversely affected by drought at the morphological, physiological and molecular level. the phytohormone abscisic acid , which is produced under the drought stress functions to regulate several developmental and physiological processes including seed maturation, germination, seedling growth and transpiration. the aba level increases under water deficit condition in plants triggering stomatal closure and responses to stress tolerance  <cit> . stress signals are recognized by specialized signaling pathways which transmit them to different cellular compartments, and the numerous evidences demonstrated that protein kinases play vital roles in the responses to such environmental stimuli  <cit> . the sucrose non-fermenting 1-related kinase  <dig>  family members, which function in diverse developmental processes in plants  <cit> , have been shown to be the positive regulators of plant response to abiotic stresses . the members of snrk <dig> family work at the merging point of the aba-dependent and aba-independent stress signaling pathways.

in arabidopsis, ten members of the snrk <dig> family have been identified and divided into three subclasses based on amino acid sequence similarity  <cit> . the subclass i comprises of kinases that are not activated by aba, subclass ii are either not activated or very weakly activated by aba . however, the subclass iii is strongly activated by aba. the amino acid sequences of all the snrk2s can be divided into two regions, the highly conserved n-terminal kinase domain, and the c-terminal regulatory domain. the c-terminal domain contains stretches of acidic amino acids, either glutamic acid   or aspartic acid  . further, the c-terminal regulatory domain consists of two subdomains, subdomain i and subdomain ii. the subdomain i which is required for activation by osmotic stress, independent of aba, is present in all snrk <dig> family members; whereas subdomain ii is necessary for the aba response and is specific to the aba-dependent snrk2s only. all the snrk <dig> members, except snrk <dig> , were found to be rapidly induced by different osmolyte treatments, such as mannitol, sorbitol, sucrose or nacl and few of them also by aba  <cit> . the arabidopsis ost1/snrk <dig> /srk2e protein kinase has been shown to regulate the aba-mediated stomatal closure and act upstream of reactive oxygen species production  <cit> . however, the srk2e  mutant in arabidopsis has been found to be defective in aba-induced stomatal closure and it showed a wilty phenotype  <cit> . the srk2d/e/i triple mutant  of arabidopsis displayed dramatically decreased drought tolerance and extreme insensitivity to aba, as documented by defects in seed germination and seedling growth as well as decreased expression of aba- and stress-inducible genes  <cit> . the knockout of these three genes, which belong to the subclass iii of snrk <dig> family, therefore, almost completely blocks aba responses, demonstrating that they are the essential components of aba-stress signaling pathway in arabidopsis  <cit> .

eleven snrk <dig> members designated as zmsnrk2s have been identified in maize, and most of them are inducible by one or more abiotic stresses  <cit> . the zmsnrk <dig>  protein, which is highly homologous to arabidopsis ost <dig>  has been found to be involved in diverse stress signaling pathways, particularly in salt stress tolerance  <cit> . in wheat, the first characterized snrk <dig> member, pkaba <dig> was reported to be induced by hyperosmotic stress, aba, and multiple other environmental factors  <cit> . afterwards, three more wheat snrk <dig> members viz., tasnrk <dig> , tasnrk <dig>  and tasnrk <dig>  have been characterized and found to be involved in development and abiotic stress tolerance . thus, substantial evidence showed that the snrk <dig> protein kinases are involved in multiple environmental stress responses and all have potential biotechnological utility for generation of high yielding abiotic stress tolerant crops  <cit> . in vitro studies have documented that the aba-activated snrk2s phosphorylate the downstream target proteins in different plant species; and this phosphorylation is needed for the transcriptional activity of the individual target proteins, which in turn induce the expression of hierarchically downstream genes to mitigate the stress condition. this includes bzip transcription factors, such as trab <dig> from rice  <cit> , taabf from wheat  <cit> , and areb <dig> from arabidopsis  <cit> , or rna-binding vfakip <dig> proteins from vicia faba  <cit> .

in rice, the ten snrk <dig> members, designated as sapk1- <dig>  have been identified. all of them were found to be activated by hyperosmotic stress, and sapk8- <dig> were also induced by aba  <cit> . the overexpression of sapk <dig> showed improved salt tolerance in rice  <cit> . in the domain swapping experiments using rice sapks, it has been observed that the grafting of the non-catalytic c-terminal region from sapk <dig> , which contains the domain involved in aba-responsive activation, onto the catalytic domain of sapk <dig>  which doesn’t contain the domain for aba-responsive activation, is sufficient to confer aba responsiveness in sapk <dig>  <cit> . none of the three aba-dependent and osmotic stress-activated sapks, i.e. sapk <dig>  sapk <dig>  and sapk <dig>  belonging to subclass iii of snrk <dig> family, has been functionally characterized by transgenic approach till date. therefore, understanding the molecular basis of subclass iii sapk gene function in rice is necessary for the development of drought-tolerant transgenic rice or to design sapk gene-based marker for molecular breeding of drought-tolerant rice cultivar. we were interested in the detailed characterization of the sapk <dig> gene and its functional role in drought tolerance through  expression profiling of the gene in selected drought-sensitive and drought-tolerant rice genotypes,  determining the allelic polymorphism in the coding dna sequence  of the gene in these genotypes,  cloning the highly expressed sapk <dig> cds from the drought-tolerant rice genotype oryza rufipogon followed by assaying the kinase activity of the recombinant protein, and  developing transgenic rice lines for overexpression and endogenous silencing of this particular gene. transgenic experiments demonstrated that in contrast to silencing, the overexpression of sapk <dig> increased drought tolerance and grain yield by adjusting osmotic potential and stomatal closure, thereby decreasing the cellular membrane damage and reactive oxygen species activity. in addition, the increased and decreased aba sensitivity and aba-responsive gene expression in transgenically overexpressed and silenced lines, respectively, confirmed that the sapk <dig> is a positive regulator of aba-dependent stress-responsive signaling pathway in rice.

RESULTS
the single copy sapk <dig> gene displays differential transcript expression profile and allelic polymorphism in drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive rice genotypes
the ability of a plant species to withstand drought stress condition is a genotype-dependent functional activity of the particular genes involved in the stress-adaptive pathways. hypothesizing that the sapk <dig> is a key player in drought tolerance, the relative expression level of sapk <dig> gene was analysed in nine selected drought-sensitive and drought-tolerant indica rice genotypes along with two wild rice progenitors during the vegetative and reproductive stages of growth through real-time pcr. for the analysis, first strand cdna was synthesized from leaf total rna of all the genotypes under the condition of before stress , after stress  and after recovery . the real-time pcr analysis of bs, as and ar samples revealed that the expression level of sapk <dig> transcript in o. rufipogon is substantially greater than the other drought-tolerant genotypes viz., o. nivara, nagina <dig>  manipuri and vandana in both vegetative stage  and reproductive stage . on the other hand, the sapk <dig> expressions in drought-sensitive genotypes viz., hrc <dig>  ir <dig>  ir <dig>  ir <dig>  ir <dig>  and swarna were comparatively much lower than the drought-tolerant genotypes in both the growth stages . it was also observed that the expression of sapk <dig> transcript is elevated in reproductive stage  compared to the vegetative stage . to check the influence of gene copy number if any, on the differential expression of sapk <dig> transcript in the rice genotypes under the same growth conditions, we performed southern hybridization using sapk <dig> gene-specific probe. a single band observed in southern blot indicated the presence of one copy of the endogenous sapk <dig> gene in all the rice genotypes investigated . the occurrence of a single copy endogenous sapk <dig> gene in the selected rice genotypes implies that the gene copy number does not influence the differential expression of sapk <dig> gene in drought-sensitive and drought-tolerant rice genotypes.fig.  <dig> expression profiling and copy number determination of the endogenous sapk <dig> gene in  <dig> selected rice genotypes. real-time pcr analysis showing sapk <dig> gene expression in  vegetative stage and  reproductive stage  in rice plants growing under the condition of before stress , after stress  and after recovery . for internal reference, rice polyubiquitin <dig>  gene was used. error bars represent the mean ± sd of triplicate measurements. student’s t-test was performed to find out statistically significant differences . c southern hybridization blot depicting the presence of one copy of the endogenous sapk <dig> gene in all the rice genotypes examined. lanes 1- <dig> represents o. rufipogon, o. nivara, nagina <dig>  manipuri, vandana, swarna, ir <dig>  ir <dig>  ir <dig>  ir <dig> and hrc <dig> genotypes, respectively. d multiple amino acid sequence alignment of subclass iii snrk <dig> family members including sapk <dig> protein for the prediction of secondary structures following the prosite expasy bioinformatics tool



single nucleotide polymorphism  in the cds is of great importance in the crop improvement programme as the functions of several genes are known to be modulated by the associated snps leading to the differences in plant performance. assessing genetic diversity of candidate gene sequences involved in stress-responsive pathways lead to the identification of specific alleles which are linked to particular agronomic traits of abiotic stress responses. trait enhancing superior alleles, which are dominant and express better in wild species than cultivated varieties and are left behind during evolution and domestication of present-day commercial cultivars, can be transferred to elite genetic backgrounds for improvement of desirable traits of a particular crop species  <cit> . therefore, it was of interest to investigate the presence of naturally occurring polymorphisms in the cds of sapk <dig> gene in all the chosen rice genotypes.

for the analysis of natural allelic polymorphism, the full-length cds of sapk <dig> gene was amplified through rt-pcr from total rna of leaf tissues using two gene-specific primers. all the genotypes showed positive pcr amplification with an expected product size of ~1086 bp . the sequence of each pcr amplicon was determined after cloning them individually. three non-synonymous snps were detected among the sapk <dig> cdss obtained from eleven rice genotypes upon multiple sequence alignment. the first non-synonymous snp was found in the cds of swarna, creating the nucleotide modification  at the 593rd position from the start codon, which led to the 198th amino acid change from isoleucine  to asparagine  . the resulted amino acid change was located in the αf-helix of sapk <dig> protein . the 2nd non-synonymous snp was noticed in o. rufipogon, causing the nucleotide modification  at the 746th position from the start codon with the 249th amino acid change from proline  to leucine  , and this was observed in the αh-helix of the sapk <dig> protein . the 3rd non-synonymous snp, being observed in a few genotypes, resulted in the nucleotide modification  at the 970th position from the start codon, which changed the 324th amino acid from serine  to arginine . serine is present at 324th amino acid position in swarna, ir <dig>  ir <dig>  ir <dig>  hrc <dig>  and vandana; whereas arginine occurs at the same position in o. rufipogon, o. nivara, ir <dig>  nagina <dig> and manipuri . this last amino acid change was found to be located in between the snrk <dig> box and aba-dependent activation box  of sapk <dig> protein . various reports of non-synonymous snps leading to amino acid substitution in the cds of drought responsive genes and their correlation with the particular trait have been published earlier  <cit> . however, the present study showed that the natural occurrence of three non-synonymous snps did not affect any important functional domains and also could not be correlated with the differential expression level of the sapk <dig> gene in the chosen drought-sensitive and drought-tolerant rice genotypes. therefore, the highly expressed sapk <dig> cds of wild progenitor o. rufipogon was selected for further functional analyses.

the sapk <dig> gene from drought-tolerant o. rufipogon encodes a protein belonging to subclass iii of snrk <dig> family, exhibits higher expression in leaf tissues and responses to both drought stress and aba treatment
the full-length cds of sapk <dig> gene was cloned after isolation from the drought-tolerant rice genotype o. rufipogon by rt-pcr . comparison of the cloned gene sequence  with a previously reported sequence  of sapk <dig> gene from a japonica rice cultivar revealed alternation of the nucleotide at two positions. a nucleotide modification  at the 746th position from the start codon created the 249th amino acid change from proline  to leucine ; and another nucleotide modification  at the 970th position from the start codon altered the 324th amino acid from serine  to arginine  . the phylogenetic analysis of rice snrk <dig> family members  with arabidopsis snrk2s and related proteins from other plants revealed that the ten sapk proteins of rice are clustered into three subclasses . each subclass contains members from both arabidopsis and rice snrk <dig>  demonstrating that the distinction of these subclasses originated before the divergence of dicots and monocots. the sapk <dig> was found to be clustered into subclass iii of snrk <dig> family along with the well characterized aba-activated snrk <dig> genes, i.e. aapk of vicia faba  <cit>  and ost <dig>  of arabidopsis  <cit> , which have been reported to be involved in the aba-regulated stomatal closure. apart from these two genes, the sapk <dig> was observed to be grouped with snrk <dig>  and snrk <dig>  of arabidopsis  <cit> , and sapk <dig> and sapk <dig> of rice  <cit>  in the subclass iii of snrk <dig> family. growing evidence indicate that subclass iii snrk2s are the global regulators of multiple stress signaling pathways, and these proteins have certain characteristic functional domains .fig.  <dig> analyses of phylogenetic relationship and tissue-specific expression of sapk <dig> gene cloned from the wild rice o. rufipogon. a agarose gel showing the rt-pcr amplification of sapk <dig> coding dna sequence  from drought-tolerant o. rufipogon. lane 1- <dig> pcr product, lane m- molecular marker. b phylogenetic tree of snrk <dig> family proteins from selected plant species. the phylogenetic tree was constructed in mega <dig>  software with the neighbor-joining method. the numbers indicate the bootstrap values . c analysis of real-time pcr depicting sapk <dig> transcript expression in root, shoot, leaf, leaf sheath and panicle in o. rufipogon. d real-time pcr analysis of the sapk <dig> transcript in leaf samples of o. rufipogon under dehydration and exogenous aba  treatment at  <dig>   <dig> and 48 h. untreated 0 h sample in each cases were used as control. for internal reference, rice osubi <dig> gene was used. error bars represent the mean ± sd of triplicate measurements. student’s t-test was performed to find out statistically significant differences 



the tissue specificity of sapk <dig> gene was monitored through real-time pcr analyses using the total rna sample isolated from different tissues, namely root, shoot, stem, leaf, leaf sheath and panicle. the strongest expression of sapk <dig> transcript was found in the leaf followed by root . further, to analyse the transcriptional responses of sapk <dig> gene under drought stress and aba treatment, real-time pcr analysis was performed. the sapk <dig> expression was observed to be significantly induced by exogenous aba within 6 h of treatment in comparison to drought stress. however, the sapk <dig> expression upon drought stress increased significantly after 24 h . the results indicate that the sapk <dig> is involved in responses to both drought stress and aba treatment, confirming the subclass iii nature of this snrk <dig> member  <cit> .

the sapk <dig> protein has a characteristic kinase fold structure and the recombinant protein possesses autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation activities
analysis of the amino acid sequence  derived from the cloned sapk <dig> cds revealed that the predicted molecular mass of sapk <dig> is ∼ 40 kda. the sapk <dig> shares  <dig> and 76 % sequence similarity with the two reported snf1-related kinase proteins viz., snrk <dig>  and snrk <dig>  of arabidopsis thaliana, respectively . using arabidopsis snrk <dig>   as a template, the homology modelling revealed the bilobal  kinase fold structure of sapk <dig> . the quality of the model displayed  <dig>  % residues in the core region and  <dig>  % residues in the allowed region. interestingly, the in silico structure of catalytic sapk <dig> displayed the canonical ser/thr kinase fold, identical to other snf <dig> kinase domains. the well-ordered characteristic snrk <dig> box  forming a single α-helix was found to be present in the n-terminal lobe packed parallel against the αc helix. in the n-terminal lobe, five β-sheets plus one α-helix called helix αc was found. the c-terminal lobe was found to be larger and mainly helical . the activation loop was found to be present at amino acid position  <dig> to  <dig>  in the activation loop, s <dig> and t <dig> were predicted to be the phosphorylation site for sapk <dig> activation . the catalytic cleft resides at the junction of the larger c-terminal lobe, and this cleft contains the substrate-binding site, the atp binding g-loop and the mg2+ binding site . it has been established before that the αc-helix in the n-terminal lobe is required for correct folding of the catalytic centre and kinase activation loop, and it is stabilized by the snrk <dig> box   <cit> .fig.  <dig>

to study the kinase activity of recombinant sapk <dig> in vitro, the bacterially expressed 6xhis-tagged sapk <dig> protein was purified by ni-nta chromatography under native condition  and kinase assay was performed. it was observed that the generic substrate histone iii was phosphorylated by the recombinant kinase . moreover, the occurrence of an extra band corresponding to the size of recombinant sapk <dig>  suggested that it is able to autophosphorylate. this was confirmed by performing the kinase assay in the absence of substrate . these results are in accordance with the previous reports on the kinase activity of subclass iii snrk2s, ost1/snrk <dig>  and zmsnrk <dig>   <cit> . it is known that the areb/abf proteins require the phosphorylation of their multiple conserved sites by snrk <dig> protein kinases for aba-dependent activation  <cit> . previous studies have shown that the sapk <dig> can phosphorylate the downstream areb/abf type transcription factors such as trab <dig> and osbzip <dig>  <cit> . as osbzip <dig> is phylogenetically very close to osbzip <dig>  therefore we investigated the potential phosphorylation activity of sapk <dig> on osbzip <dig> substrate. for this, the n-terminal 6xhis-tagged osbzip <dig> was expressed in the bacterial system and the recombinant osbzip <dig> protein was purified by ni-nta chromatography under native condition  and subsequently, kinase assay was performed for different time intervals. it was found that the sapk <dig> phosphorylates osbzip <dig>  and the phosphorylation efficiency is increased with the increase in reaction time . these results suggest that the sapk <dig> protein has both autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation activities in vitro, and has the potentiality of transactivation of the osbzip transcription factors in vivo.

to investigate the gain-of-function and loss-of-function phenotypes of sapk <dig> gene in rice through transgenesis, gene overexpression  and rnai-mediated gene silencing  constructs were prepared using osubi <dig> promoter and nopaline synthase  transcription terminator in the pcambia <dig> binary plasmid . both the constructs were then separately incorporated into drought-sensitive indica rice cultivar ir <dig> by agrobacterium-mediated transformation. the putative oe and rnai transformants were subjected to hygromycin selection during in vitro culture. the hygromycin selected transformants were verified by means of southern hybridization using sapk <dig> gene-specific probe to detect transgene integration patterns in t <dig> plants. southern blot analysis detected single and multiple integration lines in both oe and rnai . the oe lines of sapk <dig> were designated as saoe# <dig>   <dig>   <dig> etc., and rnai lines were designated as rnai# <dig>   <dig>   <dig> etc. the single integration t <dig> plants of oe and rnai lines were examined for the expression level of sapk <dig> transcript by real-time pcr. the real-time pcr analysis revealed that the relative expression level of sapk <dig> transcript increased significantly  in oe lines, but decreased significantly  in rnai lines compared to non-transgenic  plants . similarly, western blot analysis disclosed the increased expression of sapk <dig> protein in oe lines in comparison to rnai lines and nt plants , corroborating the real-time pcr result. further, we have also checked the expression of sapk <dig> gene at the reproductive stage of the transgenic and nt plants , and the analysis revealed the similar level and trend of expression as observed in the vegetative stage. the high sequence similarity of sapk <dig> with the other two members of snrk <dig> subclass iii in rice viz., sapk <dig> and sapk <dig>  led us to analyse the relative expression levels of these two genes in transgenic lines and nt plants. it was observed that in oe and rnai lines the relative expression levels of both the genes were not much altered in comparison to nt plants .fig.  <dig> molecular analyses of the transgenic rice lines developed for sapk <dig> overexpression  and rnai-mediated endogenous gene silencing . a southern hybridization blot of t <dig> transformants of oe plants . b southern hybridization blot of t <dig> transformants of rnai plants . for both  and , the hindiii-digested genomic dna samples were used to probe with the 470 bp fragment of sapk <dig> cds. lane nt- non-transgenic control, lane m- molecular weight marker. c the relative expression level of sapk <dig> gene was analysed in leaf tissues of oe, rnai, and nt plants in vegetative stage through real-time pcr. for internal reference, the osubi <dig> gene was used. error bars represent the mean ± sd of triplicate measurements. student’s t-test was performed to find out statistically significant differences . d western blot illustrating the expression level of sapk <dig> protein  in leaf tissues of oe, rnai and nt plants, where β-actin protein  showing equal loading in each lane



overexpression of sapk <dig> improves drought tolerance in rice by increasing the water retention capacity in transgenic plants through osmotic adjustment and stomatal closure
to examine the drought stress tolerance capacity of sapk <dig> oe and rnai lines at the vegetative and early reproductive  stages, hygromycin selected t <dig> plants were transferred into the pots and allowed to grow under glasshouse conditions for 30 days along with non-transgenic  plants. after one week of transferring the pots in net-house, each set of plants from vegetative and panicle initiation stage were subjected to drought stress by withholding water supply until the visible effect of dehydration was noticed in rnai lines and nt plants. after the duration of drought stress, plants were watered for 3 days in each case, and the survival rate  was determined. a significantly  greater survival rate was observed in oe lines when compared with rnai lines and nt plants during both vegetative stage  and reproductive stage . the observed increase and decrease in the drought tolerance ability of oe and rnai lines, respectively, clearly indicated that the sapk <dig> plays a strong role in drought tolerance in rice. previous studies on either overexpression or silencing of the aba-responsive kinase genes in rice and other plant species have documented similar results of drought tolerance or drought sensitivity, respectively  <cit> .fig.  <dig> evaluating drought stress tolerance of sapk <dig> overexpressed  and gene silenced  transgenic rice plants. a-i pictures showing three sets of plants, i.e. oe, rnai and nt in the vegetative stage under the conditions of before drought stress, after drought stress and subsequent recovery after drought stress. a-ii survival rates  of oe, rnai, and nt plants in the vegetative stage. b-i pictures showing oe, rnai, and nt plants in early reproductive  stage under the conditions of before drought stress, after drought stress and subsequent recovery after drought stress. b-ii survival rates  of oe, rnai and nt plants in the early reproductive stage. c-i comparison of water loss rate  and  relative water content  of the detached leaves from transgenic lines and nt plants at the five-leaf stage. estimation of the contents of  proline and  soluble sugar in leaf tissues of transgenic lines and nt plants before and after drought stress



globally, water availability dictates the yield of crop plants including rice  <cit> . plant with high water holding capacity can sustain the severity of drought stress better than the others. the water status in a plant body is principally determined by two critical parameters- water loss rate  and relative water content   <cit> . the wlr and rwc were measured in leaf tissues of oe, rnai lines, and nt plants. it was observed that the oe lines exhibited lower wlr and higher rwc in contrast to the rnai lines, which showed higher wlr and lower rwc in comparison with nt plants . these results indicate that the sapk <dig> plays an important functional role in enhancing the water retention capacity of the plants under water deficit condition.

additionally, we investigated the mechanism by which the sapk <dig> endows the oe rice plant for its improved water holding capacity. the two major physiological mechanisms that reduce water loss in plants under drought stress condition are the osmotic adjustment and stomatal closure. it has been established that plants under drought stress condition accumulate compatible osmolytes such as free proline and soluble sugars in order to keep the cellular structure intact by adjusting the intracellular osmotic potential  <cit> . the physiological mechanism by which the overexpression of sapk <dig> improves the water retention capacity of transgenic rice lines under drought stress was elucidated by determining the contents of proline and soluble sugar in the transgenic and nt plants. analysis of the experimental data revealed not much difference in proline and soluble sugar contents of the oe, rnai lines and nt plants while growing them under normal condition. however, upon drought stress imposition, higher contents of proline and soluble sugar were accumulated in the oe lines compared with rnai and nt plants . the significant increase in the cellular osmolyte contents in oe lines during drought stress strongly suggests that the accumulation of these osmolytes occurs due to the enhanced activity of sapk <dig>  the possible molecular mechanism of which has been discussed in the later section. on the contrary, the reduced activity of sapk <dig> in rnai lines results in decreased accumulation of osmolytes, consequently leading to drought sensitivity. similar phenotypic observations associated with cellular osmolyte concentration have been documented previously upon up-regulation or down-regulation of candidate genes  <cit> . it is to be noted that in our study the analysis has been performed after a drought stress treatment over a period of 8 days under net-house condition . however, for a comprehensive physiological evaluation of oe and rnai lines to compare with the nt plants, the analyses need to be carried out over a longer duration in the field condition, as has been suggested before  <cit> . previous reports have shown that the members of subclass iii snrk <dig>  i.e., arabidopsis ost1/snrk <dig>  and fava bean aapk are involved in the aba-regulated stomatal movement . hence in the present study, the stomatal status was observed and counted in oe lines, rnai lines, and nt plants. under normal growth conditions, the differences in the stomatal status of transgenic lines and nt plants were minimal. after the drought stress treatment, ~20– <dig> and ~27 % of stomata were completely closed in rnai and nt plants, respectively; while greater proportions  of closed stomata were present in oe lines . accordingly, the proportions of completely opened stomata were significantly lowest in oe lines among the three sets of plants . interestingly, the proportions of partially opened stomata in oe lines were comparatively highest. the variation in the stomatal movement of transgenic lines and nt plants led us to verify the expression level of two slow anion channel-associated  genes viz., osslac <dig> and osslac <dig>  the results showed that the transcript expression levels of both the genes were significantly  higher in oe lines, compared with the rnai lines and nt plants . recent investigations have documented that these two stomatal proteins are involved in anion transport  <cit> , and the sapk <dig> has been found to activate the function of osslac <dig>  <cit> . our results suggest that the stomatal closure is positively regulated by the functional activity of sapk <dig> upon osslac <dig> and osslac <dig> gene expression. it is anticipated that the phosphorylation ability of sapk <dig> might activate the transcription factor specifically required for the expression of these two genes. however, the detailed molecular mechanism of sapk9-regulated stomatal closure requires further study.fig.  <dig> monitoring stomatal closure and relative expression level of stomatal genes in sapk <dig> overexpressed  and gene silenced  transgenic rice plants. a-i representative photographs showing stomatal status in rice leaves. a-ii number of completely open, partially open and completely closed stomata were calculated before  and after stress  in three sets of plants, i.e. oe, rnai and nt plants . all the results were compiled from three independent experimental sets. error bars represent the mean ± sd of triplicate measurements. student’s t-test was performed to find out statistically significant differences . b real-time pcr analysis showing transcript level of stomatal genes-  osslac <dig> and  osslac <dig> in transgenic and nt plants during drought stress. for internal reference, the osubi <dig> gene was used. error bars represent the mean ± sd of triplicate measurements. student’s t-test was performed to find out statistically significant differences 



transgenic rice lines overexpressing sapk <dig> show reduced lipid peroxidation and increased antioxidant activity
stresses usually cause harm in plants via oxidative damage by generating reactive oxygen species , such as h2o <dig> and o2- ions. the ros are toxic and highly reactive oxygen derivatives that damage macromolecules such as dna, protein and carbohydrate, resulting in cell death  <cit> . ros causes lipid peroxidation, which results in the production of malondialdehyde   <cit> . the mda is a stress-specific molecular marker that measures the extent of cellular damage due to the imposition stress in plants. since the overexpression of sapk <dig> improved drought tolerance in rice plants through osmotic adjustment and stomatal closure, hence we examined whether the sapk <dig> functions in stress tolerance through ros detoxification. the content of mda in oe lines, rnai lines, and nt plants was measured and analysed. there were marginal variations in the content of mda in oe, rnai lines, and nt plants during normal growth condition. however, under drought stress, the mda content in oe lines was significantly  lowest among the three sets of plants, although the lipid peroxidation levels increased in all plants compared to the normal condition . the reduced mda level under drought stress in the oe lines implied that the cellular oxidative damage is less severe in these lines in comparison with rnai lines and nt plants. therefore, we were interested in documenting the ros accumulation by staining the leaves of oe, rnai lines, and nt plants with  <dig> ′-diaminobenzidine  and nitro blue tetrazolium . under normal growth conditions, there were no differences in the localized peroxide and free radicals in leaf tissues amongst transgenic lines and nt plants. however, upon exposure to drought condition, the leaf tissues of rnai and nt plant displayed higher levels of h2o <dig> and o2- accumulation in comparison with the oe lines . these results confirm that the sapk <dig> overexpression in planta has enhanced the drought tolerance phenotype of oe plants by ros detoxification, which resulted in less membrane damage.fig.  <dig> analysis of malondialdehyde  content and reactive oxygen species  activity in sapk <dig> oe and rnai plants. a estimation of mda content in leaf tissues of transgenic and nt plants before  and after drought stress . error bars represent the mean ± sd of triplicate measurements. student’s t-test was performed to find out statistically significant differences . b monitoring ros activity, as revealed by evaluation of h2o <dig> content in leaf tissues of transgenic and nt plants through visualization upon staining with dab under normal and drought conditions. c accumulation of o2- ions in leaf tissues was visualized by staining with nbt in transgenic and nt plants under normal and drought stress conditions. results were recorded from three independent experimental sets, and the result from one set is documented here



overexpression of sapk <dig> causes elevated transcript expression of aba- and stress-responsive genes resulting in increased aba sensitivity at germination and post-germination stages of transgenic rice
to understand the comprehensive function of sapk <dig> under drought stress condition, we analysed the expression profiles of some drought-inducible genes, such as trab <dig>  osbzip <dig>  osbzip <dig>  oslea3- <dig>  osrab16b, and osrab <dig>  which work hierarchically downstream of sapk <dig> in the aba-signaling pathway. the trab <dig>  osbzip <dig>  and osbzip <dig> are the rice bzip transcription factors, known to be induced by aba and drought stress  <cit> . two dehydrin proteins are encoded by osrab16b and osrab <dig>  which are transcriptionally responsive to abiotic stress  <cit> . oslea3- <dig> is a late embryogenesis abundant  protein proposed to protect cell membrane structure stable by minimizing the damage caused by increasing ion concentration in dehydrating cells  <cit>  and improves drought tolerance  <cit> . we found that the relative expression level of trab <dig>  osbzip <dig>  osbzip <dig>  oslea3- <dig>  osrab16b, and osrab <dig> increased significantly  in oe lines, compared with the nt plants . however, the levels of expression of these genes in rnai lines were significantly  lower in comparison with nt plants . these results suggest that the sapk <dig> might be a transcriptional activator of these drought-stress associated genes in the aba signaling pathway in rice, and overexpression or downregulation of sapk <dig> alters the expression of these set of genes. since most of the transcriptional activator proteins are usually localized in the nucleus, therefore we examined the subcellular localization of sapk <dig> protein in onion epidermal cells. we found increased fluorescence in cytoplasm and nucleus due the expression of sapk9–gfp fusion protein compared to that of only gfp, indicating the sapk <dig> protein was localized in these cellular compartments . the subcellular localization of sapk <dig> is similar to the previous reports on other snrk <dig> family members . the exact molecular mechanism of sapk9-mediated transcriptional activation is yet to be investigated.fig.  <dig> expression profiling of a few drought stress inducible genes working hierarchically downstream of the aba-signaling pathway and analysis of subcellular localization of sapk <dig> protein in onion epidermal cells. a-i-vi analysis of real-time pcr depicting transcript level of trab <dig>  osbzip <dig>  osbzip <dig>  oslea3- <dig>  osrab16b and osrab <dig> in leaf tissues of transgenic and nt plants during drought stress. for internal reference, the osubi <dig> gene was used. error bars represent the mean ± sd of triplicate measurements. student’s t-test was performed which indicated statistically significant differences . b sapk9–gfp fusion protein and control gfp were transiently expressed in onion epidermal cells and observed with a laser-scanning confocal microscope. upper panel : sapk9–gfp fusion; lower panel : only gfp. images were taken  in the dark field for green fluorescence,  in the bright field,  dark field green fluorescence merged with bright field image and  dapi stained nucleus   dapi stained nucleus merged with dark field green fluorescence. scale bar- 100 μm



the role of phytohormone aba in the maintenance of seed dormancy, hindrance of seed germination and inhibition of seedling growth is well documented  <cit> . since the expression of sapk <dig> gene is profoundly induced by aba , and aba-responsive gene expressions are increased in oe lines ; hence we have investigated the aba sensitivity of transgenic lines at germination and post-germination stages. the seeds from two independent oe lines , two rnai lines  and non-transgenic  plants were germinated on ms agar media with variable concentrations of aba . there were no significant differences in the germination rate of oe lines at  <dig> and 1 μm aba, but at  <dig> and 6 μm aba concentration germination rate of oe lines was significantly lowest in comparison with rnai lines and nt plants , implying that the sapk <dig> oe lines are most sensitive to aba at the germination stage. we also investigated the aba sensitivity of oe and rnai lines at the post-germination stage. the results showed no significant differences in the shoots and roots length of oe, rnai and nt seedlings grown at 0 μm concentration of aba for 14 days. however, at  <dig>   <dig> and 6 μm aba concentrations, the length of shoots and roots of oe lines decreased significantly  in comparison with rnai lines and nt plants . these findings indicate that the overexpression of sapk <dig> increases aba sensitivity at the post-germination stage as well. together with the finding on decreased aba sensitivity of sapk <dig> down-regulated rnai lines, we infer that the sapk <dig> is a positive regulator of aba-dependent stress signaling pathway in rice. our observations are consistent with the previous reports that overexpression and silencing of aba-responsive gene results in differential aba sensitivity at both germination and post-germination stages in rice  <cit> .fig.  <dig> assessment of aba sensitivity of sapk <dig> oe and rnai plants at seed germination and post-germination stages. a-i, ii germination performance of seeds grown on ms agar media supplemented with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 6 μm aba from two oe lines , and two rnai lines  compared to nt plants at 10th day. b germination rate  of seeds grown on media supplemented with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 6 μm aba from oe, rnai and nt plants at 10th day. c-i, ii the performance of transgenic and nt seedlings grown in ½ ms liquid media supplemented with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 6 μm of aba after 14 days. d comparison of  shoot length and  root length of transgenic and nt seedlings grown in media supplemented with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 6 μm aba after 14 days. for representation and better comparison amongst oe, rnai and nt plants, the nt panel is duplicated in a  and c . error bars represent the mean ± sd of triplicate measurements. student’s t-test was performed to find out statistically significant differences . results were compiled from three independent experimental sets



overexpression of sapk <dig> increases grain yield in transgenic rice under drought stress by improving pollen maturation, spikelet fertility, and panicle weight
since there was a striking difference between the transgenic oe and rnai plants with respect to the duration of drought tolerance, therefore we were encouraged to examine the grain yield attributing traits of these plants grown under drought stress. for this, two sets of oe lines, rnai lines and nt plants were grown in pvc pipes under glasshouse condition till they reach the panicle imitation stage , and subsequently transferred to net-house. upon attaining the flowering stage, plants were subjected to drought stress condition for a period of 10 days. after completion of the stress period plants were watered normally, and allowed to recover through the flowering stage until the seed maturation occurs . under drought stress condition, the panicle weight and spikelet fertility of oe lines were found to be significantly  highest among the three sets of plants . there was no obvious difference in grain length and width amongst transgenic lines and nt plants . these results indicate that the sapk <dig> gene plays a significant role in increasing the grain yield in rice by influencing panicle weight and spikelet fertility. since panicle weight and spikelet fertility are correlated with the pollen maturation and viability, therefore the number of matured and viable pollens in oe, rnai, and nt plants were investigated using i2-ki staining. the analysis revealed that oe lines had a higher proportion of mature pollen than those of rnai lines and nt plants . the proportion of mature pollen reflects the pollen viability. the more number of mature pollens correlating with the overexpression of sapk <dig> suggested that the sapk <dig> functions in increasing pollen viability. additionally, we have already found that the relative expression level of sapk <dig> is significantly high in panicle under drought stress condition . collectively, these results document that the sapk <dig> enhances spikelet fertility by regulating pollen maturation and thereby improves grain yield. interestingly, previous reports have documented that the sapk <dig> plays some functional role in the development of panicle  <cit>  as well in the pollen  <cit>  via aba-signaling pathway. however, the exact molecular mechanism by which the sapk <dig> gene regulates the spikelet fertility and grain yield in rice remain to be elucidated.fig.  <dig> evaluating grain yield of sapk <dig> overexpressed  and gene silenced  transgenic rice plants. a drought stress treatment of three sets of plants, i.e. oe, rnai and nt plants at flowering stage in pvc pipes and subsequent irrigation till seed maturation stage. b mature panicles and grains of three sets of plants. c comparison of panicle weight in three sets of plants. d comparison of spikelet fertility  in three sets of plants. e proportion  of viable pollens  in three sets of plants. error bars represent the mean ± sd of triplicate measurements. student’s t-test was performed to find out statistically significant differences . results were compiled from three independent experimental sets



possible molecular mechanism of sapk <dig> action
based on the findings of the present study and the information available in the literature, a molecular interactive pathway for sapk <dig> has been proposed . our work clearly established that the sapk <dig> acts as a transactivating kinase and a potential transcriptional activator for modulating the activity of several key components in the aba-dependent stress adaptation pathway in rice plant. we hypothesize that an unknown factor might be involved in mediating the transcriptional activity of sapk <dig>  which requires further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
we have characterized the structural, biochemical and physiological functions of sapk <dig>  a subclass iii snrk <dig> gene of rice through developing gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutants by transgenesis. the sapk <dig> transcript expression has been found to be differentially regulated in the selected drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive rice genotypes, and its expression is comparatively more elevated in reproductive stage than the vegetative stage. the sapk <dig> transcript has been observed to be upregulated by drought stress and aba treatments. the sapk <dig> protein has characteristic kinase fold structure, and is able to transactivate its target substrates, including histone iii and osbzip23; and itself is autophosphorylated. constitutive overexpression of sapk <dig> gene from a drought-tolerant wild rice genotype and rnai-mediated silencing of endogenous sapk <dig> gene in a drought-sensitive cultivar have revealed that the sapk <dig> positively regulates drought stress tolerance by boosting the osmotic adjustment and stomatal closure of the plant. the enhanced drought-tolerant transgenic rice lines overexpressing sapk <dig> display less cellular oxidative damage resulting from the reduced reactive oxygen species accumulation. the sapk <dig> overexpressed lines exhibit increased sensitivity to exogenous aba and enhanced transcription of other hierarchically downstream aba-responsive genes, indicating that the sapk <dig>  indeed, is a positive regulator of aba-mediated stress signaling pathway in rice plant. the increased functional activity of sapk <dig> overexpression in transgenic lines improves grain yield-related traits such as panicle weight and spikelet fertility by increasing the pollen viability. together, the present findings strengthen our knowledge about the functional role of sapk <dig> as transactivating kinase and a probable transcriptional activator, which can be utilized as a promising gene-based molecular marker in transgenic breeding for generating crop plants with improved drought tolerance and grain yield.
