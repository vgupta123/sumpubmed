BACKGROUND
cyanobacteria are evolutionarily important prokaryotic organisms that created the oxygenic atmosphere on earth via oxygenic photosynthesis and were the progenitors of chloroplasts in eukaryotic algae and plants
 <cit> . cyanobacteria often dominate phytoplankton as surface scum in freshwater lakes and brackish water during the summer months
 <cit> . a small number of cyanobacterial genera are typically involved in bloom formation
 <cit> . gas vesicles are common in planktonic cyanobacteria and allow the organisms to regulate their buoyancy
 <cit> . bloom-forming cyanobacteria produce an array of potent hepatotoxins and neurotoxins
 <cit> . microcystins are commonly reported hepatotoxic heptapeptides that inhibit eukaryotic protein phosphatases  <dig> and 2a
 <cit> . toxic blooms are responsible for the toxicoses of wild and domestic animals
 <cit>  and are a health risk for humans through the consumption or recreational use of water
 <cit> .

anabaena is a genus of filamentous nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria
 <cit>  that is especially common in aquatic environments, both in fresh and brackish waters worldwide
 <cit> . nitrogen fixation occurs in specialized cells called heterocysts that differentiate from the vegetative cells
 <cit> . this property combined with photosynthesis makes anabaena cyanobacteria autotrophic organisms that are able to live in a wide range of environments. strains of the planktonic anabaena genus are some of the most common cyanobacteria capable of forming blooms
 <cit> . blooms of anabaena are a serious health risk, due to the production of a range of toxins such as microcystins, anatoxins and saxitoxins
 <cit> .

cyanobacteria, including anabaena, are prolific sources of natural products, many of which have biotechnological and biomedical importance
 <cit> . in recent years, many new compounds and their biosynthetic pathways have been discovered
 <cit> . the cyanobacterial hepatotoxins, microcystins and nodularins, are the end products of nonribosomal biosynthetic pathways
 <cit> . recently, it has been shown that cyanobacteria also use diverse ribosomally encoded pathways for the production of small linear and cyclic peptides
 <cit> . to understand the role of these bioactive compounds in cyanobacteria, as well as the biotechnological exploitation of the biosynthetic machinery used to assemble them, more information on the regulation and association of these biosynthetic pathways with other metabolic processes is needed.

only a small number of genomes for planktonic bloom-forming cyanobacteria are known, including microcystis aeruginosa pcc  <dig> and nies-843
 <cit> , planktothrix rubescens niva cya 98
 <cit> , cylindrospermopsis raciborskii cs- <dig> and raphidiopsis brookii d9
 <cit> , which produce microcystins, cylindrospermopsin or saxitoxin. here, we present the complete genome of anabaena sp. strain  <dig>  a bloom-forming, microcystin-producing strain originating from a freshwater lake in finland.

RESULTS
genome overview
the anabaena sp.  <dig> genome was assembled with sanger reads that were sequenced from libraries with different size inserts  and amounted to a  <dig>  x depth of coverage. the remaining physical gaps that were derived from the unclonable regions were linked through combinatorial multiplex pcr screening of primers designed from the contig ends. the genome consists of five circular replicons, two chromosomes and three plasmids . the total size of the genome amounted to  <dig> , <dig> bp with an average g+c content of  <dig> %. the quality of the genome sequence was very high and the estimated overall sequence error of the genome was  <dig>  bp . a total of  <dig>  orfs were annotated with putative functions assigned to  <dig>   orfs from manual annotation. the remaining  <dig>   were assigned as hypothetical orfs . they were further subgrouped as  <dig>  conserved hypothetical proteins that have more than  <dig> counterparts in other bacterial genomes, and  <dig>  unique proteins that have no full-length counterparts . in addition, there are  <dig>  hypothetical orfs that lie in between, having few counterparts in other genomes. five rrna operons were identified and dispersed throughout chromosome i, two in the leading and three in the lagging strand . they have nearly identical rrna genes. sequence variations in the spacer regions separate them into two groups. two operons with consecutive trnas organized as 16s-trni-trna-23s-5s form one group. members in another group have no trna genes. a total of  <dig> trnas were distributed over both chromosome i  and ii .

* each called read base was assigned a phred score that is logarithmically related to its error probabilities
 <cit> . the error rate of each replicon was determined as the sum of the error probabilities over all assembled bases.

gene composition between the chromosomes and plasmids is highly biased. all enzymes of essential biological pathways, such as photosynthesis, are encoded in the two chromosomes. the three plasmids mostly encode integrases, recombinases, transposases, phage-related proteins and a high percentage of hypothetical proteins .

prophage remnants
remnants of three putative prophages were found, due to the presence of phage genes with a highly compact organization . however, orfs encoding phage terminases and capsid protein-encoding genes were absent. two of the putative prophage remnants are  <dig> kb in size and display high sequence similarity  but are located  <dig> kb apart in chromosome i. the third prophage remnant is located in plasmid a with a slightly larger size . these three prophage remnants have similar gene organization and share homologous genes , suggesting a close relationship between them. this indicates that anabaena sp.  <dig> may have been a lysogen at some point in the past. prophages are frequently inserted into trna genes
 <cit> . a truncated c-terminal trna  gene was found  <dig>  kb downstream of the first prophage remant in chromosome i. in addition, there is a 14-kb gene cluster containing clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  and associated cas genes found in this genome in plasmid b. it was classified as subtype i-d, according to recent studies
 <cit> . this gene cluster may provide acquired phage resistance for the strain. 

pseudogenes and transposable elements
surprisingly, a total of  <dig> pseudogenes were discovered across the genome through inspection of the disrupted orfs . more than half of the pseudogenes  were assigned to the ‘hypothetical protein’ and ‘mobile and extrachromosomal element’ categories, based on the comprehensive microbial resource database
 <cit>  . there are  <dig> pseudogenes related to dna metabolism,  <dig> of which were predicted with functions involved in dna restriction and modification. most of the pseudogenes  were derived from truncation of the orfs. other types of pseudogenes that were found either contain frame shifts , nonsense mutations  or insertions . the distribution of these pseudogenes overlaps that of the mobile genetic elements, especially insertion sequences  . 
 <cit> 

in all,  <dig> complete and partial iss, with a total size of  <dig>  kb, were annotated from the anabaena sp.  <dig> genome . sixty-five of these iss were classified into  <dig> subfamilies, according to the isfinder database
 <cit> ,  <dig> of which occurred in two to seven copies . sixteen of the elements could not be assigned to a family in the isfinder database. pseudogenes with disrupted orfs were often found adjacent to iss , where  <dig> disrupted transposases were also discovered . is transposition disrupted not only host-specific orfs but also the orfs of other is element transposases . 

* all members of the subfamily are disrupted.

in addition, a total of  <dig> complete or partial miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements  were located in the genome. their lengths ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp . these small genetic elements are usually present in multiple copies and are characterized by terminal inverted repeat regions
 <cit> . the mites identified in this study could be grouped into type ii mites. a total of  <dig> mites were distributed in intergenic regions, while  <dig> were found within disrupted chromosomal orfs and led to the prediction of pseudogenes . 
 <cit> , while similarity of the paired bases was indicated by the colour scheme shown. three sets of inverted repeat regions  were located from the secondary structure of the sequences, and labelled in the multisequence alignment

bioactive peptide synthesis
anabaena sp.  <dig> produces many bioactive peptides by nonribosomal or ribosomal pathways. in addition to the previously identified nonribosomal biosynthetic gene clusters for anabaenopeptilides
 <cit> , anabaenopeptins
 <cit>  and microcystins
 <cit> , a large gene cluster responsible for production of glycolipopeptides  was found . in addition to an anacyclamide-encoding cyanobactin gene cluster
 <cit> , seven putative bacteriocin gene clusters were also discovered . all these biosynthetic gene clusters were located in chromosome i. together they amount to a total of ~ <dig> kb, thus at least 5% of the genome is dedicated to the production of bioactive peptides. 
 <cit> 

the hassallidin biosynthetic gene cluster is the largest gene cluster in anabaena sp.  <dig>  it encodes four nonribosomal peptide synthetase enzymes that catalyse the incorporation of amino acid residues into cyclic hassallidin peptides . surprisingly, the genome assembly revealed two different contigs within the same sequence, which led us to the discovery of a 526-bp deletion in the peptide synthetase gene hasv . the deletion introduced a frameshift and rendered the gene cluster nonfunctional. in pcrs performed with anabaena sp.  <dig> dna originating from the years 1998– <dig>  the deletion first appeared around 2003– <dig>  but had not fully segregated by  <dig> . due to the deletion, hassallidins can no longer be detected in current cultures of anabaena sp.  <dig>  however, hassallidins could still be identified from cells extracted prior to the deletion in  <dig> and from an anabaenopeptilide synthetase gene mutant  strain of anabaena sp.  <dig> constructed in 1999
 <cit>  . 

restriction-modification systems
the anabaena sp.  <dig> genome contains a very high number  of restriction-modification  system-related orfs, amounting to  <dig> % of the gene repertoire. another bloom-forming cyanobacterium, microcystis aeruginosa nies- <dig>  had nearly the same number of rm system-related orfs, but other cyanobacteria had lower numbers of rm genes . there are  <dig> type i, ii, iii and iv rm systems, constituting  <dig> chromosomal orfs in anabaena sp.  <dig> . the majority  were categorized as type ii systems. in addition, there are  <dig> separate restriction enzymes and  <dig> unaccompanied dna methyltransferases. however,  <dig> of them are pseudogenes with disrupted orfs, including five enzymes in type i, ii and iii rm systems, three restriction enzymes and five dna methylases.
 <cit> 

photosynthesis
the photosynthetic gene clusters in the genome retain the conserved organizational pattern found in other cyanobacteria
 <cit> . a quarter of the photosynthetic genes are distributed in chromosome ii, such as psba, psbb, and operons of atpihgfdac encoding atp synthase, petbd cytochrome b6/f complex and apcabc light antenna. the rest of the photosynthetic genes were found in chromosome i.

nitrogen fixation
anabaena sp.  <dig> was grown in the laboratory in nitrogen-free medium and is capable of active nitrogen fixation. the nif operon, encoding for the dinitrogenase and dinitrogenase reductase enzyme complexes, was located in chromosome i with conserved gene organization . three excision elements of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> kb were found within the nif operon in anabaena sp.  <dig>  each element is adjacent to a single site-specific recombinase in the opposite strand that removes the elements during heterocyst development
 <cit> . the 80- and  <dig> -kb excision elements that split the nifh gene into three parts with sizes of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp have not been described previously in cyanobacteria. the third element, which commonly occurs in heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria , splits the nifd gene into two parts with  <dig>  and  <dig> bp. the nif operon spans  <dig> kb including the three excision elements. the 80-kb element contains one of the prophage remnants. in addition, the fourth 11-kb excision element was detected within the nitrogen-fixation associated hupl gene. surprisingly, the counterparts of pats and hetn, both involved in pattern formation by preventing neighbouring cells from undergoing heterocyst differentiation
 <cit> , could not be detected in this genome. 

transporter proteins
the genome shows a remarkable density of genes encoding transporter proteins. there are four porin genes that encode channels for passive nutrient diffusion. a variety of atp transport systems, often in operons, are present in both chromosomes  for active uptake of various substrates, such as cations and anions, nucleosides, amino acids, sugars, glycolipids and polyamines. six copies  of the abc transporter operon devbca, which encode essential exporters for heterocyst envelope formation
 <cit> , are present. two of these are encoded in chromosome ii.

signal transduction and gene regulation
in all,  <dig> orfs, including those carrying insertions, were annotated for signal transduction and regulation. a total of  <dig> orfs , scattered over both chromosomes, were predicted to be involved in two-component signal transduction systems. they include  <dig> histidine kinases ,  <dig> response regulators and  <dig> hybrid kinases according to their domain composition. these also include five pseudogenes. there are  <dig> ser/thr type protein kinases, six protein phosphatases and other regulation or sensor domain-containing proteins that form the one-component systems that coordinate with the two-component systems. moreover, all group  <dig>  and group  <dig>  sigma factors are present in the anabaena sp.  <dig> genome. the common group  <dig>  and one extracytoplasmic function sigma factors were found as well. four proteins with anti-sigma-factor antagonist domain were also identified. they work together with the sigma factors in regulating various cell processes at the transcriptional level.

gas vesicle gene cluster
an  <dig> -kb gvp gene operon encoding the building blocks of gas vesicles was located in chromosome i. the operon organization  is similar to that in other sequenced cyanobacterial strains
 <cit> , but with seven tandem gvpa genes . a truncated gvpg gene was found. this coincided with loss of buoyancy from cells in the present culture, while the original culture showed the buoyant phenotype. 

metabolic pathway analysis
we annotated  <dig> putative metabolic pathways in the genome of anabaena sp.  <dig> , in addition to those for bioactive peptide biosynthesis. these pathways are composed of  <dig> enzymes that catalyse  <dig>  enzymatic reactions. however, nearly half of these pathways are incomplete, because  <dig>  enzyme-encoding genes are missing or were not found. many of the incomplete pathways are responsible for catabolic processes, such as nutrient degradation, utilization and assimilation, whereas the essential pathways are complete, e.g. amino acid metabolism, photosynthesis and glycolysis. the energy-related pathways have fewer missing enzymes than others. nearly 40% of the genes in this genome are hypothetical or with unknown functions, due most likely to their low homology to counterparts in model organisms. this may leave some of the enzymes in annotated pathways unrecognized. moreover, our analysis revealed that some enzyme-encoding genes are pseudogenes with disrupted orf. for instance, one  of the two deoxycytidine triphosphate deaminases, which catalyse the conversion of dctp to dutp in the pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotide de novo biosynthesis pathway, was interrupted by an inserted dna recombinase. in addition, an alcohol dehydrogenase-encoding gene  was found with a deletion. this enzyme catalyses the reduction of acetaldehyde to ethanol in fermentation pathways. three copies of alcohol dehydrogenases were found in this genome in an intact form.

discussion
here, we report the complete genome of anabaena sp.  <dig>  an ecologically important hepatotoxic bloom-forming cyanobacterium. the genome has a multichromosome composition with essential metabolic core genes encoded in the two circular chromosomes. this study was the first to report such a multichromosome composition in the order of nostocales. previously, the strain of cyanothece sp. atcc  <dig> was known with two chromosomes, one circular and one linear
 <cit> . we succeeded in completing the genome with high sequence quality, even though it contains a plethora of repetitive mobile genetic elements with diverse sizes  and five nearly identical rrna operons. a large number of repeats makes genome assembly difficult and cannot be resolved simply by increasing the sequencing depth e.g. using the next-generation low-cost sequencing platforms, due in large part to their short read lengths
 <cit> . as a result, the majority of genomes remain in the ‘draft’ state, including a number of bloom-forming cyanobacteria
 <cit> . in this study, we tackled this problem by including data from mate-pair libraries with large inserts
 <cit> . this strategy could be used in sequencing bloom-forming cyanobacterial genomes that are rich in mobile genetic element-derived repeats
 <cit> . complete and high quality genomes are crucial to comparative genomics and genome evolution studies
 <cit> , pathway reconstruction for metabolic engineering
 <cit>  and postgenomic analysis
 <cit> .

the anabaena sp.  <dig> genome contains various types of mobile genetic elements, including plasmids, prophage remnants, iss and mites. they are collectively termed as mobile genetic elements, since they are capable of moving within genomes  and between prokaryotic organisms 
 <cit> . these elements may have contributed to genome plasticity, genomic rearrangements and most likely the multichromosome composition. iss are mobile genetic elements transferred within and between species through a cut-and-paste mechanism, which is driven by the internally encoded transposases
 <cit> . the percentage of is elements in anabaena sp.  <dig>  was comparable to that in other cyanobacteria, but less than in the bloom-forming hepatotoxin-producing microcystis aeruginosa strains, in which is elements comprised about 10% of the genomes
 <cit> . recent genome studies showed that the planktonic cyanobacteria cylindrospermopsis raciborskii cs <dig> and crocosphaera watsonii wh <dig> also contain high numbers of repetitive elements, partly contributed by iss
 <cit> . mites are small mobile sequences that have only terminal inverted repeats
 <cit> . the mites found in this study were classified as type ii, because there is no evident similarity found with inverted repeats of the iss in this genome
 <cit> . the mobilization of type i mites was hypothesized to be mediated by the transposase of is that holds the same terminal inverted repeats
 <cit> . this may imply an autonomous mechanism for the movement and duplication of type ii mites.

surprisingly, we found that nearly 5% of the gene repertoires are pseudogenes that include not only disrupted transposases but also disrupted orfs from many other different functional categories . however, the pseudogenes found in the anabaena sp.  <dig> genome were most likely derived from the transposition activities of iss and mites. mutations and genome rearrangements induced by transposable elements have also been described in microcystis aeruginosa strains
 <cit> . however, an abundance of pseudogenes has rarely been reported in genomes of cyanobacteria, except the endosymbiotic strain ‘nostoc azollae’  <dig>  which has an extremely high number  of pseudogenes that were attributed to the genome erosion process
 <cit> . here, we accurately labelled a number of disrupted orfs, many of which could be associated with the transpositions of mobile genetic elements, through detailed manual annotation . recent metagenomic data analysis also demonstrated the incidence of genes inactivated by is transposition, including some with essential functions, within the population of synechococcus strains in hot spring mats
 <cit> . high frequencies of mobile genetic element-derived pseudogenes are likely to be common among transposable element-rich cyanobacteria, especially in strains of bloom-forming genera, but as yet remain undocumented.

anabaena sp.  <dig> dedicates 5% of its genome to biosynthesis of small peptides, such as hepatotoxic microcystins and the protease inhibitors anabaenopeptins and anabaenopeptilides. between 3% and 4% of the genomes is typically devoted to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites among sequenced cyanobacterial genomes
 <cit> . however, previous works only counted nonribosomal gene clusters and missed the ribosomal biosynthesis pathways. here, we took into account both ribosomal and nonribosomal gene clusters. considering the widespread occurrences of ribosomal pathways in cyanobacteria
 <cit>  and that nonribosomal gene clusters also amount to  <dig> % of anabaena sp.  <dig> genome, it appears that about 5% of the genome is commonly assigned to natural product biosynthesis in cyanobacteria. an additional nonribosomal gene cluster responsible for production of the antifungal compounds hassallidins was discovered during genome assembly, mainly because the gene cluster was inactivated by a deletion event. moreover, the genome sequence led us to discover the ribosomal production pathway for cyanobactins and their common occurrence in anabaena <cit>  as well as in other planktonic cyanobacteria
 <cit> . we also identified seven putative bacteriocin gene clusters in the genome. their end products are presently unknown, but the high number of these types of gene clusters in cyanobacterial genomes
 <cit>  suggests that yet new compound families from cyanobacteria await identification and structural determination. to date, bacteriocins have only been identified in prochlorococcus marinus mit9313
 <cit> .

the toxin microcystin synthetase  gene cluster was shown to be of ancient origin
 <cit> . previous environmental studies showed the stable presence of mutant cyanobacterial mcy gene clusters, which were inactivated both in freshwater samples by iss
 <cit>  and in brackish water by mites
 <cit> . note that the intact hassallidin gene cluster is still retained in parallel cultures of mutant anabaena sp.  <dig>  which has an inactivated anabaenopeptilide synthetase gene cluster
 <cit> . our results showed that those mutants with an inactive hassallidin biosynthetic pathway prevailed over cells with functional genes in the culture. this may indicate a growth advantage for cells with mutated bioactive compound synthetase gene clusters under laboratory conditions, perhaps due to a lower metabolic burden.

similarly, we detected a loss of gas vesicles, the subcellular structures responsible for buoyancy, which are essential for bloom-forming planktonic cyanobacteria
 <cit> . this phenotype is derived from the truncated gvpg gene in the gvp operon . the truncation most probably was selected when the strain was purified  on solid media
 <cit> . loss of buoyancy due to rearranged gas vesicle gene clusters by is transpositions was also previously described in microcystis strains kept in laboratory culture
 <cit> .

anabaena sp.  <dig> has been under continuous culture since  <dig> and was introduced into pure culture in 1992
 <cit> . the mobile genetic elements were probably acquired by the strain prior to this time. some metabolic properties of anabaena sp.  <dig> were altered by the activities of these mobile genetic elements. we found mobile element-derived pseudogenes among the genes encoding enzymes for the metabolic pathways of the strain. this may indicate that anabaena sp.  <dig> has lost genes for metabolic pathways with nonessential functions under laboratory conditions, where optimal, nutrient-rich and competitor-free environments are provided. our analysis revealed that the laterally acquired mobile genetic elements may have played a role in the process. perhaps growing cyanobacteria under conditions that reflect those found in nature would reduce genetic changes.

the anabaena sp.  <dig> genome contains  <dig> rm systems, which function as microbial defence systems against foreign dnas
 <cit> . type i, ii, iii and iv rm systems were annotated from the anabaena sp.  <dig> genome, type ii restriction enzymes being the most numerous rms . previously, restriction enzyme activities, such as afliii, in anabaena sp.  <dig> were experimentally confirmed
 <cit> . an rm system usually contains a restriction endonuclease that recognizes a specific sequence for cleavage and a dna methyltransferase that modifies the same sequence and protects it from cleavage
 <cit> . bacteria that possess multiple rm systems are thought to be virtually impregnable. this seems to hold true for anabaena sp.  <dig> since it is resistant to genetic manipulation. over the years we have succeeded in producing only one mutant of this strain
 <cit> . this is a familiar feature with many filamentous cyanobacteria
 <cit> , which were proposed more intensively protected by rm systems than unicellular strains
 <cit> . however, this has been contradicted by the frequent occurrence of rm systems in genomes of unicellular toxic bloom-forming microcystis aeruginosa strains
 <cit> . to date the two highest numbers of restriction enzymes are found in two planktonic microcystin-producing cyanobacteria, anabaena sp.  <dig>  and microcystis aeruginosa nies- <dig> . this perhaps is a reflection of the ecological or evolutionary pressures exerted on planktonic cyanobacteria. the anabaena sp.  <dig> genome also contains abundant mobile genetic elements. the question that naturally arises is how these mobile elements have invaded the planktonic cyanobacterial genomes with the presence of pronounced rm systems. the mobile genetic elements are, however, relatively short sequences  and may lack many restriction cleavage sites of restriction endonucleases. for anabaena sp.  <dig>  this may be partly explained by the disrupted genes encoding enzymes in rm systems . in addition, it is known that rm systems may be inefficient in blocking single-stranded or modified foreign dna and work only temporarily
 <cit> . however, it was suggested that rm systems may also be mobile genetic elements that cause genome rearrangements
 <cit> .

in filamentous cyanobacteria, the cellular processes of photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation are spatially separated and compartmentalized into vegetative cells and heterocysts, respectively
 <cit> . anabaena strains have long been used as model organisms for studying heterocyst development and nitrogen fixation in cyanobacteria
 <cit> . the differentiation processes from vegetative cells to heterocysts involve programmed dna rearrangements at multiple sites in anabaena genomes
 <cit> . to date, three known elements, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kb, have been reported in nifd, fdxn and hupl genes in heterocystous cyanobacteria
 <cit> . here, for the first time we report the simultaneous presence of four excision elements in the genome of anabaena sp.  <dig>  moreover, two novel elements for the nifh gene were found and one of these is the largest known in size  . the nifh gene is commonly used to detect nitrogen-fixing organisms in environmental samples. the presence of excision elements is likely to cause problems with detection of nifh genes if they occur commonly among heterocystous cyanobacteria. our results showed that the heterocyst differentiation process in cyanobacteria involves precise genomic splicing over distances as long as  <dig> kb. the excision elements interrupting nif genes in heterocystous cyanobacteria appear to play a role in protecting nitrogenase and hydrogenase from the effects of oxygen during heterocyst development
 <cit> . a compact and conserved nif operon was recently discovered without any excision elements in a symbiotic strain ‘nostoc azollae’  <dig> 
 <cit> . this evidence supports the proposed loss of photosynthetic activity in cells of ‘nostoc azollae’  <dig>  which may have differentiated only to perform nitrogen fixation for the hosts
 <cit> . a similar nif operon without excision elements was presented in the heterocyst-forming cyanobacterium cylindrospermopsis raciborskii cs- <dig>  but lost in its closely related strain raphidiopsis brookii d9
 <cit> . this may suggest that the growth of these strains is less dependent on the nitrogen fixation process. the presence of multiple copies of devbca operons in anabaena sp.  <dig> may increase the efficiency of nitrogen fixation, whereas lack of the pats and hetn genes in anabaena sp.  <dig>  and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii cs-505
 <cit>  may suggest a new pattern of heterocyst spatial development. simultaneous inactivation of pats and hetn genes in nostoc sp. pcc  <dig> is known to be lethal, due to overproduction of hetr and heterocysts
 <cit> . genome mining of cylindrospermopsis raciborskii cs- <dig> suggested that a protein with the c-terminal pentapeptide rgsgr may take over the function of pats
 <cit> . similarly, we also identified an orf  with the c-terminal pentapeptide in anabaena sp.  <dig>  which may play a role as a hetr suppressor.

the  <dig> -mb anabaena sp.  <dig> genome contains a lower number of genes for signal transduction than the  <dig>  mb-genome of nostoc pcc 7120
 <cit>  and nearly 10-mb genome of nostoc punctiforme <cit> . however, the number of signal transduction pathways is positively correlated with genome size. it is also well known that soil microbes such as nostoc punctiforme invest more heavily in sensing changes in environmental conditions than organisms living in more stable aquatic environments. usually, a one-to-one relationship exists between the cyanobacterial sensors  and response regulators
 <cit> , but in anabaena sp.  <dig> the ratio is lower, indicating either integration of multiple signalling pathways or perhaps loss of sensoring systems when grown in protected laboratory environments.

CONCLUSIONS
this study gives a snapshot of the anabaena sp.  <dig> genome. it shows a high potential of genetic variation by virtue of the occupation of a wide range of mobile genetic elements. our results indicated that mobile genetic element-imposed selective pressure led to genome adaption to the strain by trimming nonessential genes and pathways during cultivation in the laboratory. in addition, due to the array of biosynthesis gene clusters for multiple peptides in anabaena sp.  <dig>  the complete sequence provides a valuable research subject in studying the regulation of natural product biosynthesis, which may have potential pharmaceutical and biotechnology applications.
