BACKGROUND
folates are essential water-soluble b-vitamins, including tetrahydrofolate  and its derivatives. folates play an important role as one-carbon  donors and acceptors in all types of species. folate molecules consist of a pteridine ring, a para-aminobenzoate  ring, and a tail of one or more l-glutamate. the c <dig> substituents attach to the n <dig> position of the pteridine and/or to the n <dig> position of p-aba to form all types of folate derivatives that have different properties and functions  <cit> . de novo biosynthesis of folate is restricted to plants and microorganisms, but not animals. the reactions required to synthesise tetrahydrofolate are basically the same in plants as in bacteria and fungi  <cit> . in cytosol, gtp cyclohydrolase i  catalyses the first step during conversion of gtp to dihydroneopterin, and dihydroneopterin  aldolase  cleaves the lateral side chain of dhn to form 6-hydroxymethyldihydropterin. in plastids, 4-aminodeoxychorismate  is produced from chorismate by adc synthase  and is esterified to form p-aba by adc lyase . pterins and p-aba are subsequently condensed, glutamylated, and reduced to form thf monoglutamate in the mitochondria. in mitochondria, dihydrofolate is converted by hydroxymethyldihydropterin pyrophosphokinase  and dihydropteroate synthase , which is a bifunctional enzyme in plants, and then attached to the first glutamate through the action of dihydrofolate synthetase . later, dihydrofolate is reduced to thf by dihydrofolate reductase . thf monoglutamate can be transported to cytosol and plastids, respectively, and become polyglutamylated through the action of folylpolyglutamate synthetase  in different cellular compartments. during c <dig> metabolism, polyglutamylated thf is used as a cofactor in glycine  and  <dig> -methylene thf biosynthesis from serine by serine  hydroxymethyltransferase , and ser serves as an alternate donor of c <dig>  thf is recycled back by glycine decarboxylase , which is involved in  <dig> -methylene-thf formation from gly and thf, and the glycine decarboxylase complex consists of four different component proteins; namely, p-, h-, t-, and l-proteins  <cit> . then,  <dig> -methylene-thf can be reversibly oxidised to 10-formyl thf by the bifunctional  <dig> -methylene-thf dehydrogenase/ <dig> -methenyl-thf cyclohydrolase . compound 10-formyl thf deformylase  can hydrolyse 10-formyl thf to release thf and formate, while 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase  can consume thf and formate to re-form 10-formyl thf. besides,  <dig> -methylene-thf can be reduced to 5-methyl-thf  by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase , and 5-methyl-thf can serve as a methyl donor for methionine synthesis  from homocysteine. additionally, 5-formyl thf cycloligase  and 5-formyl thf cycloligase-like protein  can catalyse 5-formyl thf  conversion to  <dig> -methenyltetrahydrofolate; while shmt <dig> promotes the formation of 5-f-thf  <cit> . overall,  <dig> enzymes are involved in folate and c <dig> metabolism in plants   <cit> .fig.  <dig> schematic representation of the key folate and c <dig> metabolic reactions in maize. enzymes involved in folate biosynthesis include: aminodeoxychorismate  synthase  and adc lyase  in the chloroplast, gtp cyclohydrolase i  and dihydroneopterin  aldolase  in the cytosol, hydroxymethyldihydropterin pyrophosphokinase and dihydropteroate synthase , dihydrofolate synthetase , dihydrofolate reductase , and folylpolyglutamate synthetase  in the mitochondria. enzymes involved in c <dig> metabolic pathways include: glycine decarboxylase complex , serine hydroxymethyl transferase  <dig> ,  <dig> -methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/ <dig> -methenyl-tetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase ,  <dig>  10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase , methionine synthase , 10-formyl thf deformylase , 10-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase , and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate cycloligase  



due to the lack of functional dhna, hppk/dhps, adcs, adcl, and dhfs, humans cannot synthesize folate de novo, and thus folate fortification in foods such as wheat flour is required  <cit> . besides, overexpressing folate biosynthetic and metabolic enzymes originating from plant or non-plant organisms is known to be an effective alternative to enhance folate contents in food crops including tomato, rice, and maize . maize is a major staple food crop globally. to date, few studies on folate metabolism genes in maize are available  <cit> . for example, the first dhfr-ts gene from maize was cloned and the rna transcripts for zmdhfr-ts were shown to accumulate to high levels in developing maize kernels and meristematic tissues  <cit> . another gene involved in folate metabolism was characterised in the brown midrib  <dig>  mutant, in which a functional mthfr gene showed reduced transcript levels. as a result, the mutant showed a reddish-brown colour associated with reductions in lignin concentration and alterations in lignin composition  <cit> . however, no systematic characterisation of folate metabolism genes in maize has been reported, and how folates flow during maize kernel formation remains unknown. therefore, identification of folate-related genes at the whole genome level and characterisation of folate metabolism during maize kernel formation could provide a foundation for understanding of the folate metabolism in maize and molecular breeding of folate-fortified maize varieties.

in this study, an intensive in silico analysis was performed to screen for genes involved in folate metabolism using all publicly available databases. we found that the maize genome contains all enzymes required for folate and c <dig> metabolism, which are characterised by highly conserved domains, similar to other species. to further advance our understanding of the folate metabolism in maize, two representative maize inbred lines with significant differences in total folates in mature seeds were chosen to investigate the expression of folate-related genes and the profiling of folate derivatives during kernel formation.

RESULTS
identification and phylogenetic analysis of putative folate metabolic genes in maize
to understand the folate metabolism in maize, we first investigated the conservation of all folate-related genes between arabidopsis and maize on a whole-genome scale as the folate metabolism pathway has been well characterised in arabidopsis compared to other plant species. folate metabolism involves folate synthesis and the c <dig> cycle. enzymes involved in folate synthesis in maize were identified via blast using homologs from arabidopsis. consequently, eight enzymes were identified . one ortholog was identified for hppk/dhps and adcs, respectively, two for gtpchi, dhna, dhfs, and fpgs, respectively, three for adcl, and four for dhfr. within each group of maize orthologs such as gtpchi, dhna, dhfs, and dhfr, the protein similarities were all higher than 90 %. the protein similarity between the two fpgs orthologs was  <dig>  %. a rather low protein similarity was observed in between adcl orthologs . these results indicated that the majority of orthologs involved in folate synthesis were conserved in maize.table  <dig> genes involved in folate synthesis identified in maize

eight enzymes involved in c <dig> metabolism in maize were also identified, which were annotated as shmt, gdc complex , dhc, mthfr, ms, 10-fdf, fths, and 5-fcl, respectively. because shmt <dig> is the major functional shmt enzyme in arabidopsis  <cit> , maize shmt <dig>  the closest counterpart of arabidopsis shmt <dig>  was used in this study. we found that the maize gdc protein complex consisted of one gdcp, one gdct, and four gdchs, and the lowest sequence similarity to maize gdch among the gdch orthologs was  <dig>  %. 10-fdf and fths each had one ortholog; mthfr and 5-fcl each had two orthologs, and the sequence similarity between each pair of orthologs was  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively. dhc and ms each had three orthologs, and the lowest sequence similarities among orthologs were  <dig>  %  and  <dig>  % , respectively . these results indicated that the majority of orthologs involved in c <dig> metabolism at protein level were highly conserved in maize.table  <dig> genes involved in c <dig> metabolism in maize

to investigate whether folate metabolism-related proteins identified in maize contain conserved domains for their enzymatic activities, all homologs from plants , mammals , and microorganisms  were analyzed using simple modular architecture research tool  <cit>  . as expected, the enzymes participating in folate metabolism and c <dig> cycle were largely conserved between maize and other species. the representative proteins from maize, arabidopsis, and e. coli are shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  a detailed comparison of the enzymes involved in folate synthesis between the three species led to the following interesting findings. first, the same pfam domains were present with different lengths. for example, both fpgs and dhfs contained the mur_ligase_m domain that is responsible for attaching glutamates to folylpolyglutamates or monoglutamates, respectively. however, the mur_ligase_m domain in fpgs was 36-amino acid shorter than that in dhfs both in maize and arabidopsis . second, gtpchi evolved two repeats of the gtp_cyclohydroi domain in the plants, while only one in e. coli . third, three enzymes, including adcs, hppk/dhps, and dhfr/ts, have evolved to be bifunctional enzymes in the plants. for example, both maize and arabidopsis adcs contained two gatases, one anth_synt_i_n, and one chorismate_binding domain, functionally corresponding to anth_synt_i_n and chorismate_binding-containing paba and gatase-containing pabb in e. coli to produce adc. similar phenomena were observed in hppk/dhps and dhfr/ts, respectively . two enzymes involved in c <dig> reactions contained different number of pfam domains in different species. for example, three gcv_t domains were present in the maize gcst, whereas two in arabidopsis and e. coli. the five domains in e. coli ms, i.e. s-methyl_trans, pterin_bind, b12-binding, b12-binding_ <dig>  and met_synt_b <dig>  were found to be merged as two domains of meth_synt_ <dig> and meth_synt_ <dig> in arabidopsis and maize .table  <dig> conserved domains in enzymes of folate synthesis in maize, arabidopsis, and e. coli

phylogenetic trees of folate-related proteins from sorghum, rice, millet, arabidopsis, human, rat, mouse, yeast and e. coli were constructed using the neighbour-joining method. the majority of clade credibility values between maize and sorghum or millet were higher than 70 %, suggestive of a close relationship between the enzymes in maize with those in sorghum and millet. these observations are consistent with the fact that maize, sorghum, and millet share a common c <dig> origin  <cit>  . some homologs, including adcs, adcl, dhna, hppk/dhps, and dhfs, were not present in animals , and the remaining homologs from plants and animals were divided into two sibling groups . there was a special type of tree where the plant branches were divided into multiple classes, and each class contained most of the plant species, such as dhc, adcl, 5-fcl, and gdch . the remaining trees were characterized that all the plant homologs were classed as a single clade, in which the maize orthologs were either present as a single gene, such as adcs, hppk/dhps, gdct, gdcp, shmt <dig>  hppk/dhps, 10-fdf, and fths, or as multiple genes, such as dhna, dhfs, gtpchi, dhna, dhfs, dhfr, ms, fpgs, and mthfr . these results indicate that the folate metabolism-related proteins are conserved in maize, and the differentiation of the function of these proteins is complicated during the evolutionary process.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic trees of folate-metabolism related proteins which lack homologs in animals. phylogenetic trees of folate-metabolism related proteins  from maize, sorghum, millet, rice, arabidopsis, yeast, and e. coli constructed by mega version  <dig> using neighbour-joining algorithms. a, adcs; b, adcl; c, dhna; d, hppk/dhps; e, dhfs. accession numbers used in this figure are: adcs sorbi , adcs setit , adcs orysj , adcs arath , paba ecoli , pabb ecoli , pabs yeast ; adcl <dig> sorbi , adcl <dig> sorbi ; adcl <dig> sorbi , adcl <dig> setit , adcl <dig> setit , adcl <dig> setit ; adcl <dig> orysj , adcl <dig> orysj , adcl <dig> orysj ; adcl <dig> arath , adcl <dig> arath , adcl <dig> arath , pabc ecoli , pabc yeast ; folb <dig> sorbi , folb <dig> setit, folb <dig> setit , folb <dig> orysj ,folb <dig> arath , folb <dig> arath , folb <dig> arath , folb ecoli ,fol <dig> yeast ; hppk/dhps <dig> sorbi , hppk/dhps <dig> sorbi , hppk/dhps <dig> setit , hppk/dhps <dig> setit , hppk/dhps <dig> setit , hppk/dhps orysj ,hppk/dhps <dig> arath , hppk/dhps <dig> arath , hppk ecoli , fol <dig> yeast ; dhfs sorbi ,dhfs setit , dhfs orysj , dhfs arath , folc ecoli , fold yeast ; adcl <dig> sorbi , and folb <dig> orysj

maize differed from arabidopsis in the number of genes participating in folate and c <dig> metabolism. for example, more orthologs of dhfr, gtpchi, dhfs, and gdch as well as less orthologs of dhna, 10-fdf, fpgs, dhc, hppk/dhps, and gdcp were identified in maize than in arabidopsis. of these enzymes, four, including atdhfs, atfpgs <dig>  atfpgs <dig>  and atfpgs <dig>  functioned as a ligase in arabidopsis  <cit>  . a mutation in atdhfs caused embryo lethality  <cit> , and the dysfunction of fpgs <dig> or fpgs <dig> resulted in abnormal responses to low nitrogen in the dark or light  <cit> . these reports are suggestive of distinct functions between the dhfs and fpgs in arabidopsis, albeit they contain the same domain. in maize, the mur_ligase_m domain was also found to be present in the corresponding orthologs, including two dhfss and two fpgss, and further biochemical and genetic studies on these orthologs will elucidate their biological functions.

dhnas were reported to have distinct expression pattern between arabidopsis and maize  <cit> . in arabidopsis, three dhna orthologs were identified, among which atfolb <dig> was highly expressed in roots, stems, siliques, young leaves, and mature leaves, whereas atfolb <dig> was undetectable  <cit> . however, only two dhna orthologs were identified . the transcripts of folb <dig> maize and folb <dig> maize were abundant in roots, shoots, developing leaves and tassels, and seeds  <cit> . these observations imply that the maize orthologs may play different roles than arabidopsis ones.

folate profiling in maize kernels
maize kernels are the primary source of folates for humans  <cit> . investigation of folate biosynthesis during kernel formation and in mature seeds is important for understanding folate metabolic flux in maize. to this end, two representative maize inbred lines with a significant difference in total folates in dry seeds were chosen. ji <dig> is originated from china, belonging to the nss subpopulation with pedigree being  × ; gems <dig> is from the united states, belonging to the tst subpopulation with pedigree being 2282-01_xl380_s11_f2s4_9226-blk26/ <dig>  <cit> . 5-f-thf and 5-m-thf in the dry seeds from these two inbred lines grown in different locations were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy . irrespective of the significant variations across the years, gems <dig> contained a lot more total folates than ji <dig>  with  <dig>  folds being the smallest difference in  <dig> . moreover, it was observed that 5-f-thf accounted for over  <dig>  % of total folates in ji <dig> and  <dig>  % in gems <dig> across the four consecutive years. these results indicated that 5-f-thf was the major storage form of folate derivative in both gems <dig> and ji <dig> regardless of the total folate levels in dry seeds.table  <dig> the contents of total folate and the proportion of 5-f-thf in mature dry seeds

each inbred line was measured once across the four consecutive years



to investigate how folate derivatives are accumulated during kernel formation, the kernels at r <dig>  on dap  <dig>  r <dig>  on dap  <dig>  r <dig>  on dap  <dig>  r <dig>  on dap  <dig>  and r <dig>  on dap  <dig> were collected for lc-ms analysis in  <dig>  in contrast to that in dry seeds, 5-m-thf was more accumulated than 5-f-thf in young seeds of both lines from dap  <dig> to dap <dig>  gems <dig> and ji <dig> contained similar levels of total folates in the seeds at the early developmental stages which was indicated by the ratio of folates in gems <dig> vs folates in ji  <dig> being around  <dig> . at the late developmental stages, i.e. dap  <dig> and dap  <dig>  the total folates in gems <dig> were significantly higher than that in ji <dig> from . these results were quite different from that observed in dry seeds, suggesting an ongoing active folate metabolism during the seed maturation.fig.  <dig> folate profiling of kernels during formation. folate profiling of kernels during formation and in dry seeds of ji <dig> and gems <dig>  respectively. data are means ± sd , and each replicate consisted of  <dig> mg of plant material. dap, days after pollination



5-m-thf accounted for over 60 % of the total folates in gems <dig>  and over  <dig>  % in ji <dig>  during early stages of kernel formation . however, no significant change in 5-f-thf was observed before dap  <dig> in either of the inbred lines: 5-f-thf in gems <dig> maintained ~ <dig>  nmol/g fw, while that in ji63 ~  <dig>  nmol/g fw before dap <dig>  after dap  <dig>  5-m-thf was decreased to a similar level in both lines, and the proportion of 5-m-thf was also reduced due to the increased 5-f-thf . notably, from dap  <dig> on, a much sharper increase of 5-f-thf was observed in gems <dig> than in ji <dig> . the profiling of these two inbred lines demonstrated that 5-m-thf was the dominant folate derivative at least before dap  <dig>  implying a more active c <dig> reaction at early stages of seed development than late stages given the fact that 5-m-thf is the donor for c <dig> cycle.table  <dig> the contents of total folate and proportion of 5-m-thf during the early stage of kernel formation

different metabolites show different accumulation patterns during seed development, and the storage metabolites normally start to accumulate from the early developmental stage  <cit> . in maize, over 80 % of total starch is stored in the endosperm, 80 % of total oil in the embryo, and proteins are found in both the embryo and endosperm  <cit> . the rate of oil synthesis typically peaks between dap  <dig> and dap  <dig>  and the accumulation peaks on dap 30; carotenoids behave in a similar manner  <cit> . starch accumulation occurs from dap  <dig>  peaks on dap  <dig>  and remains steady thereafter  <cit> . likewise, amino acids accumulate during the early stage, and steady-state transcripts of the genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis peak in kernels on dap  <dig> and in embryos on dap  <dig>  <cit> . it has also been reported that some metabolites are decreased during kernel formation. for example, flavone is decreased during dap  <dig> to dap  <dig> in maize  <cit> . unlike the metabolites mentioned above, folate derivatives showed different accumulation patterns in maize kernels. 5-m-thf peaked on dap  <dig> and consistently decreased, whereas 5-f-thf remained unchanged at low levels during the early stages, but gradually increased to high levels in dry seeds . these results indicate that the various folate derivatives may differ one aother in functioning during seed development in maize.

transcript expression of folate-related genes in maize kernel
to understand the transcriptional expression of the genes involved in folate and c <dig> metabolism, the ortholog genes identified above were investigated in the developing seeds of ji <dig> and gems <dig> using qrt-pcr . the same samples were used as that used for folate profiling. transcripts of the genes involved in folate biosynthesis were most abundant on dap  <dig> in the two lines , and a similar pattern was observed for c <dig> metabolism-related genes , albeit an exception was observed for adcl <dig> in ji <dig> . the most active dna synthesis takes place at early stage of seed development , for which the folate-dependent purine and pyrimidine synthesis is required  <cit> . thus, the observation that the highest transcript levels of folate-related genes were detected on dap  <dig> is supportive of the previous reports, and indicates that the folate and c <dig> metabolism is active in young seeds.fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr of folate-synthesis related genes during kernel formation. qrt-pcr of folate-synthesis related genes during kernel formation of ji <dig> and gems <dig>  respectively. three biological samples were used for analysis and all reactions were performed in quadruplicate. data are means ± sd . names of the proteins are listed in table  <dig>  the same samples were used as that used for folate profiling. because expression of adcl <dig> was not detected, it’s not shown

however, a precaution must be taken to correlate the gene transcript levels with folate levels. first, the folate profiling revealed a peak of 5-m-thf on dap  <dig>  but transcripts of the genes encoding ms, consuming 5-m-thf to synthesize methionine, and mthfr, catalyzing formation of 5-m-thf, peaked on dap  <dig> and decreased sharply on dap  <dig> and dap <dig> . second, there was no significant difference in transcript abundance of the folate-related genes between gems <dig> and ji  <dig> although the total folates in the dry seeds were markedly different. the observations mentioned above suggest an existing complicated folate metabolism-regulatory mechanism in maize seeds. investigation of the enzymatic activities of folate-related enzymes in combination with a genome-wide association study would allow us to elucidate the roles of the folate metabolism-related proteins in folate derivative accumulation in maize kernels.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, these findings suggest that folate and c <dig> metabolism is conserved between maize and other species, especially sorghum and millet. metabolite profiling demonstrates that 5-m-thf is the dominant folate derivative in early developing seeds, and 5-f-thf is the major storage form in mature seeds. these two folate derivatives play different roles during kernel development. genes involved in folate and c <dig> metabolism are actively expressed at the early stages of kernel development. this study provides a foundation for a future in-depth investigation of folate metabolism in maize.
