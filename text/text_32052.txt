BACKGROUND
in  <dig> the spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee  recommended that a postal survey of sheep farmers in great britain , to which farmers could respond anonymously, should be carried out  <cit> . the first such survey was undertaken in  <dig>  <cit> , and aimed to improve estimates of the incidence of scrapie and overcome the perceived unwillingness of some farmers to report the disease.

farmer-based surveys have been used to estimate the prevalence and incidence of scrapie in gb  <cit> , the netherlands  <cit> , ireland  <cit>  and the shetland isles  <cit> . where surveys are used to collect information on sheep demography and farm management, flock-level risk factors for scrapie occurrence can also be investigated  <cit> . in particular, the  <dig> survey identified several risk factors  <cit> . flock size, geographical region, lambing practices and keeping certain sheep breeds were all shown to influence the risk of scrapie occurring in a flock. further analysis indicated that the likelihood of scrapie occurring in homebred animals was influenced by the proportion of replacement animals bred on a farm. finally, scrapie was more likely to be transmitted within a flock, following exposure, in farms which bought-in large numbers of rams, purchased few ewes and bred a high proportion of replacement animals.

to update the findings of the  <dig> survey a further postal survey was undertaken in november  <dig>  <cit> . this was the first occasion in which a large-scale postal survey had been repeated. the design of the  <dig> survey was based on that run in  <dig>  but also took into account the impact of the  <dig> foot-and-mouth disease epidemic in gb, the introduction of the national scrapie plan for gb  in  <dig> and asked more refined questions in certain areas of interest. the  <dig> survey also coincided with the introduction of large-scale surveillance for scrapie, including testing of animals found-dead on farm  <cit>  and animals slaughtered for human consumption  <cit> .

estimates for the prevalence and incidence of scrapie based on the  <dig> survey have been reported elsewhere  <cit>  and here we focus on identifying flock-level risk factors for disease. importantly, the  <dig> survey gathered information that allowed us to examine risk factors for both the acquisition of infection and its subsequent spread within a flock. for our purposes, farms that acquire infection have their first case in a purchased animal; farms with subsequent transmission have cases in homebred animals.

RESULTS
 risk factors for scrapie to occur in a flock 
comparing farms that have ever had scrapie  with those which have never had the disease   indicated that all regions in england had similar odds of having scrapie; the risk of having disease was  <dig>  times higher in shetland ; and it was lower in central and southern scotland ) and in wales , w). commercial flocks had a lower risk of scrapie than purebred ones. flocks in which ewes were lambed in individual pens had a lower risk of disease than those in which ewes were lambed in group pens in a building, while flocks which always lambed in the same location had a higher risk than those which sometimes lambed in the same location. keeping crossbred charollais ewes, suffolk rams or swaledale rams was associated with an increased risk of having scrapie, while keeping blackface rams was associated with a decreased risk. an interaction between flock size and stocking density was found, which indicated that the risk of scrapie increased significantly with flock size only when the stocking density was relatively high .

 risk factors for homebred cases to occur in a flock 
for farms that have had scrapie in at least one homebred animal  there was little regional variation in risk, except in shetland  where the odds of having a homebred case were  <dig>  times higher . commercial farms were less likely to have homebred cases than purebred farms. the risk of homebred scrapie increased  <dig> -fold for each 10% increase in the proportion of home-bred animals. the risk was also higher if lambs were bought-in to the farm; or if ewes were lambed in group pens in a building. keeping suffolk ewes, swaledale ewes or charollais rams was associated with an increased risk of homebred scrapie while keeping bluefaced leicester ewes or beulah speckled face rams were associated with a decreased risk.

an interaction between flock size and stocking density was identified and included in the final model. this implied that the risk of scrapie in homebred animals increased significantly with flock size only when the stocking density was relatively high . a further interaction was identified between flock size and lambing practices. however, the frequencies for some combinations of factor levels were zero or very small  and, therefore, this interaction was not included in the final model.

 risk factors for transmission to occur within a flock 
comparing farms that have had scrapie in homebred animals  with those which have had cases in purchased animals only  indicated that the risk of transmission occurring within a flock increased  <dig> -fold for each 10% increase in the proportion of homebred animals . transmission was less likely to occur in lowland compared with hill flocks, while keeping crossbred texel ewes was associated with a decreased risk of a within-flock outbreak.

for each of the models a hosmer-lemeshow goodness-of-fit test  <cit>  indicated an acceptable fit of the model to the data .

discussion
this paper provides an update of the results of an earlier postal survey conducted in  <dig>  <cit> , but has further explored regional effects in scotland and wales; the effect of the temporary housing on and then return of sheep from other farms; the confounding effects of the location and its regularity of use when lambing on the farm; and whether or not popular ram breeds or crossbreeds were kept on farms.

the robustness of the survey depends on the ability of farmers to recognise scrapie in their animals. in an attempt to minimise farmer misdiagnosis, a leaflet on the clinical signs of disease was included with the questionnaire and, of those farmers who reported having scrapie in their flock, only  <dig> % gave inappropriate answers to questions on clinical signs of scrapie  <cit> .

there was significant regional variation in the risk of scrapie , as was also observed in the  <dig> survey  <cit> . in  <dig>  the risk of ever having scrapie was slightly higher in south east england  and the west midlands , and lower in yorkshire and humberside  than in  <dig>  in the analysis of both surveys scrapie occurrence is not limited to any time period and, hence, the changes in the estimates are unlikely to reflect temporal changes in scrapie risk, rather they may reflect changes in farmer awareness of scrapie.

flock size has often been identified as an important risk factor for scrapie, with an increase in flock size associated with an increase in risk  <cit> . an effect of flock size was also identified in this study , but only in an interaction with stocking density. at higher stocking densities  the risk of scrapie increases with flock size as expected, though the increase is statistically significant only for flocks in the third quartile. by contrast, there appears to be no association with flock size for flocks in the first quartile; an effect that is accounted for by an unexpectedly high number of small flocks stocked at low density which reported scrapie. this could reflect a bias in the data, by which farmers with small flocks are able to observe their flocks more closely and, hence, are more likely to spot disease. an interaction between flock size and stocking density was noted in the  <dig> survey  <cit> , but the authors did not give sufficient detail to allow any comparison to be made.

farm type reflects the land on which a flock grazes, while flock type reflects the primary business of the flock, namely the production of breeding stock  or lambs for human consumption . the effects of farm and flock type were similar in both the  <dig> and  <dig> surveys . there was a lower risk of having scrapie in commercial flocks compared with purebred flocks and a higher risk of within-flock transmission following exposure in hill flocks compared with other farm types. the difference in risk between commercial and purebred flocks reflects differences in flock management. sheep spend a smaller amount of time in commercial flocks before being sold on and, consequently, it is less likely that disease would be observed. differences in the risk of within-flock transmission in hill compared with other farm types may be a result of management practices specific to hill flocks. alternatively, it could reflect a higher frequency of scrapie susceptible prion protein  genotypes in hill flocks, primarily related to sheep breeds kept on these farms  <cit> .

the movement of animals has often been identified as an important mechanism for the transmission of scrapie between flocks  <cit> . the results of the  <dig> survey suggest that buying-in lambs carries a greater risk than buying-in rams or ewes. this agrees with the results of the shetland survey  <cit> , but differs from the  <dig> survey where buying-in rams increased, and buying-in ewes decreased the odds of scrapie  <cit> . the differences between the results for the  <dig> and  <dig> surveys most likely reflect the impact of the  <dig> foot-and-mouth disease epidemic in gb on purchasing behaviour in the twelve months preceding the  <dig> survey. compared with the  <dig> survey, fewer farms reported purchasing rams or ewes while more reported purchasing lambs in the  <dig> survey. this identifies a potential shortcoming of the survey in that the data on purchasing behaviour are based on the previous twelve months, while scrapie occurrence is not limited to a particular time period, thus making comparison between surveys difficult.

flock management related to lambing influenced the risk of scrapie. in particular, an increase in the proportion of replacement animals bred on the farm was associated with a greater risk of homebred cases within the flock, as was also observed in the  <dig> survey  <cit> . in flocks where sheep were lambed in individual pens in a building, the risk of scrapie was lower compared with those in which sheep were lambed in group pens in a building. furthermore, flocks which always lambed in the same location had a higher risk of scrapie than flocks which did not. the association between lambing practices and scrapie risk reflects the probable role in transmission of infectivity in the placenta  <cit>  and foetal membranes  <cit> . consequently, scrapie transmission is likely to be affected by the duration and proximity of contact between sheep at lambing.

whether or not certain breeds and crossbreeds of ewes and rams were kept on a farm influenced the risk of scrapie ; something also observed in the  <dig> survey  <cit> . two breeds  were identified as having the same impact on scrapie risk in both surveys, but the remaining breeds differed between the surveys. the impact of breed on scrapie risk may reflect the influence of breed-specific management practices, but could also arise because of intrinsic differences in risk amongst sheep breeds. these intrinsic differences could reflect differences in the prp genotype profile amongst breeds  or some other breed effect, possibly not associated with the prp gene. however, it is important to stress that the postal survey is based on the past, farmer-diagnosed, occurrence of scrapie over an unspecified time-period. the reported breed differences reflect, therefore, historical differences and take little account of changes in the susceptibility of breeds as a result of recent breeding programmes and, in particular, the nsp. they categorically do not imply that the presence of these breeds increases the risk of scrapie occurring now.

the relationship between breed, prp genotype and scrapie risk raises a potential shortcoming of this study, namely that it ignores the effect of the prp genotype profile of a flock on the acquisition and within-flock transmission of scrapie. although prp genotype strongly influences the risk of individual animals developing clinical disease  <cit> , the impact of prp genotype on risk at a flock-level remains to be determined . modelling studies, however, suggest that the frequency of prp genotypes will be a significant factor in a within-flock outbreak of scrapie  <cit> . a further risk factor not explored is the influence of feeding practices, which a recent study has suggested may affect the occurrence of scrapie  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
similar flock-level risk factors for scrapie were identified within the  <dig> and  <dig> anonymous postal surveys in great britain. important risk factors include geographical region, flock type , flock size, sheep breed, trading practices and the use of certain lambing practices.

the results of the two surveys differed in the influences of specific geographical regions and purchasing of lambs on the risk of scrapie. rather than reflecting changes in scrapie risk, these differences are most likely a consequence of changes in farmer awareness and the impact of the  <dig> foot-and-mouth disease epidemic, respectively.
