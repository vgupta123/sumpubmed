BACKGROUND
scmv and mdmv are positive-sense single strand rna potyviruses that cause significant yield loss in susceptible genotypes of maize, sugarcane, and sorghum  <cit> . scmv is notably harmful in europe and china, mdmv in the southern us corn belt  <cit> . both closely related potyviruses are transmitted in a non-persistent manner by aphids mainly to members of the poaceae family  <cit> . disease symptoms are mosaic, chlorosis, leaf reddening, necrosis, and stunting  <cit> . both viruses spread systemically and particularly fast in young susceptible plants  <cit> .

out of  <dig> early-maturing maize dent inbred lines investigated by kuntze et al.  <cit> , three  were found to be completely resistant to scmv, mdmv, jgmv, and srmv, both in field and greenhouse experiments. depending on the population used, one to five genes were assumed to be required for complete scmv or mdmv resistance  <cit> . two major scmv resistance genes, scmv <dig> and scmv <dig> were mapped to chromosomes 6s and 3l, respectively, by utilising qtl mapping and bulked segregant analysis   <cit> . additional three minor qtl were identified on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . presence of resistance alleles at both loci, scmv <dig> and scmv <dig>  is crucial for complete scmv resistance. scmv <dig> suppresses symptoms at all developmental stages, scmv <dig> at later stages of infection  <cit> . one major mdmv resistance gene  mapped to the same region of chromosome 6s as scmv <dig>  so far, it is not clear, whether or not mdm <dig> and scmv <dig> are the same or closely linked genes. the scmv1/mdmv <dig> chromosome region contains a cluster of resistance gene analogues  <cit> , making both possibilities equally likely.

expression profiling based on microarrays allows generation of global gene expression patterns for any developmental stage, tissue type, or environmental factor  <cit> . the method has previously been successfully applied for identification of scmv resistance candidate genes in maize  <cit> . suppression subtractive hybridization  and unigene-microarrays identified a subset of differentially expressed genes in response to scmv infection, the majority of which related to cell rescue and defence, signal transduction, and transcription categories. moreover, some of the genes identified co-localised with scmv resistance genes scmv <dig> and scmv <dig>  thus, expression profiling seems to be an appropriate tool to study host-resistance responses and to detect pathogenesis-related genes.

the objectives of this study were to a) compare expression profiles of four near-isogenic lines after infection with scmv or mdmv: f <dig> ss/ss, f <dig> rr/rr, f <dig> ss/rr and f <dig> rr/ss, carrying fixed susceptibility  or resistance alleles  at the scmv <dig> and scmv <dig> locus, respectively; b) compare expression patterns between time points, from the time of mechanical inoculation until  <dig> hours after inoculation; c) compare expression profiles for infection with two different viruses; d) investigate the potential and reliability of the combination of two expression profiling technologies, such as microarrays and quantitative real time rt-pcr in the identification of validated differentially expressed genes for scmv/mdmv resistance; e) identify candidate genes for scmv <dig> and scmv <dig> that could potentially be utilised in breeding for virus resistance; and f) relate the findings of this study to previous scmv experiments.

RESULTS
scmv/mdmv phenotype analysis
twenty-two out of  <dig> and  <dig> out of  <dig> f <dig> ss/ss plants showed visible disease symptoms two weeks after inoculation with scmv and mdmv, respectively. symptom appearance was not tested for additional weeks, due to previous experience with the potyvirus pathosystem, where 100% infected plants of the susceptible genotype occur at later stages . the occurance of symptoms in the other three near-isogenic lines depends on the presence of resistance loci and has been thoroughly tested before  <cit> .

cdna microarray-based expression profiling
scmv experiment: within-time-point analysis
 <dig> observations for each of the five time points and the mock control were collected for pair-wise comparisons of near-isogenic genotypes, giving altogether  <dig> observations across all time points.  <dig> sequences showed significant differential expression within time points and pair-wise contrasts at a fdr level of p ≤  <dig>   . in total  <dig> different genes showed differential expression across pair-wise contrasts and time points, representing  <dig> % of  <dig> printed genes , with only  <dig> genes being expressed in the mock control experiment .

differential expression presented for a given genotype pair and time point.

the majority of significantly differentially expressed sequences was identified for time point t <dig> , followed by t <dig> , t <dig> , t <dig> , t <dig> , and t <dig>  . the number of expressed sequences was significantly different between t <dig> and all other time points at a significance level of 1%, and between t <dig> and t <dig> at a significance level of 5% .

in the whole set of  <dig> observations a similar distribution of up-regulated genes was found for all four near-isogenic genotypes. when considering only significantly differentially expressed genes, the majority of genes were up-regulated in genotype f <dig> ss/rr, carrying the scmv <dig> resistance locus . except for  <dig> % of genes, the folds of change of significantly differentially expressed genes were below 2-fold .

six pair-wise genotype-contrasts were considered. most significantly differentially expressed genes summarised over all time points were found between f <dig> rr/rr - f <dig> ss/rr , followed by f <dig> rr/rr - f <dig> rr/ss , and f <dig> ss/ss - f <dig> rr/rr  . out of the  <dig> different genes showing differential expression,  <dig> were in common among two pair-wise contrasts,  <dig> among three and  <dig> among four pair-wise contrasts. none of the genes showed common differential expression among five or all six pair-wise comparisons.

two genes  were most commonly significantly differentially expressed within time points and for different genotype pairs,  <dig> and  <dig> times respectively .

scmv experiment: between-time-point analysis
 <dig> out of  <dig> observations showed significant differential expression between time points at the level of p ≤  <dig> . most significantly differentially expressed genes were found in comparisons of time point t <dig> with all other time points .

the majority of genes were up-regulated in t <dig>  with significantly differentially expressed genes surpassing all observations in this time point by more than double .

all  <dig> genes from the within-time-point analysis were also significantly differentially expressed in the between-time-point analysis .

comparison to previous scmv studies
in order to maximise the chance to identify putative candidate genes involved in resistance to scmv and mdmv, pre-selected scmv candidate genes were spotted on the array utilised for this study. shi et al.  <cit> , in their studies on scmv infected maize reported  <dig> and  <dig> differentially expressed genes when utilising macro- and microarray approaches, respectively.  <dig> of those genes were successfully amplified and included in our microarray experiments. the remaining about 40% of genes included on our custom microarray comprised resistance candidate genes and resistance gene analogues. for the  <dig> sequences, differentially expressed within-time points, 80% were derived from the pre-selected genes. when considering redundancy of detecting the same gene within time points repeatedly,  <dig> %  of the pre-selected genes, but only  <dig> % resistance gene analogues  showed differential expression.

ontology description of genes differentially expressed in the scmv experiment
maize molecular function go assignment  was performed for  <dig> significantly differentially expressed ests with available annotations from the within-time-point experiment. since more than one biological function can be assigned,  <dig> go hits with  <dig> go terms were obtained. out of these, six each were assigned to catalytic activity  and molecular function unknown , respectively, four to transporter activity  and three to binding activity  . moreover, three homologous genes  have been previously determined as pathogenesis-related genes  <cit> .

genetic map positions
for  <dig> out of  <dig> ests map positions were determined in silico using the maize gdb , while seven of the rga sequences were mapped beforehand . for some genes, more than one map position was available based on mapping experiments or various blast applications . the majority of genes  was located on chromosome  <dig>  in a continuous bin  <dig>  –  <dig> , whereas three genes each were located on chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. furthermore, two genes were assigned to chromosome  <dig> , carrying the scmv <dig> resistance gene, and another two to chromosome  <dig> , carrying the scmv <dig> gene.

mdmv experiment: within-time- point analysis
only two genes were significantly differentially expressed in the mdmv experiment at a fdr level of p ≤  <dig>  within time points. the two genes were significantly differentially expressed at two different time points and all were up-regulated in f <dig> ss/ss. one of the two genes  was also significantly differentially expressed within time points in the scmv experiment. the fold of change did not exceed 3-fold for all three significant gene × time point combinations .

mdmv experiment: between-time-point analysis
forty-six percent out of  <dig> observations showed significant differential expression between time points at a fdr p level ≤  <dig> . the majority of up-regulated differentially and significantly differentially expressed genes were found for t <dig> . distribution of genes regarding their fold changes is shown in additional file  <dig> 

the two genes  identified in the within-time-point analysis as significantly differentially expressed were also significantly differentially expressed in the between-time-point analysis .

scmv experiment: quantitative rt-pcr
six out of the  <dig> consistently differentially expressed sequences from microarray experiments were selected for validation by qrt-pcr based on their map position, expression pattern, fold of change in microarray experiments, or sequence homology related to resistance response genes. these included genes expressing a metallothionein-like protein, 26s ribosomal rna, 14-3-3-like protein gf14- <dig>  two genes for s-adenosylmethionine synthetase  <dig>  and germin-like protein  <dig> . an endogenous maize actin gene was used as a reference in this experiment. coefficients of determination  for reference and target genes were between  <dig>  and  <dig> , confirming good quality of standard curves. pcr efficiencies for target and reference genes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , except of germin-like protein deviating from the standard pcr efficiency for target gene up to e =  <dig>  .

differential expression of the metallothionein-like protein homologue  was validated by qrt-pcr with a fold change of  <dig>   as compared to  <dig>   fold from microarray experiments. the s-adenosylmethionine synthetase  <dig> gene  and germin-like protein  <dig>  were validated with a fold of  <dig> , as compared to  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold from microarrays, respectively. the putative 26s ribosomal rna gene  and the s-adenosylmethionine synthetase  <dig> gene  were not validated when averaging four biological replications , but had significant fold of changes in one of the four replications . the 14-3-3- like protein gf14- <dig>  was not validated by qrt in any of the four biological replications. however, the fold value for three replications ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold.

discussion
validation and reliability of data
comparison to previously published data
the purpose of this study was to identify and validate genes involved in resistance response to scmv and mdmv. in previous scmv experiments  <cit> , a set of candidate genes was identified to show significant differential expression between near-isogenic scmv resistant and susceptible inbred lines. these genes, together with resistance gene analogs  were spotted on our cdna scmv array. twice as many genes based on earlier studies showed differential expression as compared to rgas, indicating usefulness of pre-selection and reliability of microarray approach.

comparison of scmv and mdmv experiments
the mdmv experiment was set up to compare response of isogenic lines containing scmv <dig> and/or scmv <dig> regions from the resistant fap1360a inbred line to related but different viruses. comparative studies of related viruses displaying common symptoms in the same host offer an opportunity to link changes in global gene expression to specific symptoms and to identify common genes involved in resistance responses  <cit> . it was assumed in the experimental design that f <dig> rr/rr demonstrates full resistance to both scmv and mdmv  <cit> . however, the finding of only very few significantly differentially expressed genes within time points in the mdmv compared to the scmv experiment supports the reliability of our scmv results, because the mdmv experiment compared only susceptible, while the scmv experiment resistant and susceptible isogenic genotypes.

comparison of array and qrt data
one of the most important issues after performing microarray experiments is validation of their results. preferentially significantly differentially expressed genes within time points for comparisons of f <dig> rr/rr with f <dig> ss/rr or f <dig> rr/ss were considered. the 26s ribosomal rna gene was chosen because of its putative map position on chromosome  <dig> and high fold change, whereas the gene putatively expressing a metallothionein-like protein was selected due to its high fold change and differential expression at all time points. the gene putatively expressing a 14-3-3-like protein gf14- <dig> and the s-adenosylmethionine synthetase  <dig> were selected due to their expression pattern, and the germin-like protein  <dig> due to its map location on chromosome  <dig> 

the genes coding for metallothionein-like protein, s-adenosylmethionine synthetase  <dig>  and germin-like protein  <dig> were confirmed by qrt experiments to be differentially expressed at significant levels. the germin-like protein showed very high pcr efficiencies, a likely result of template quantity, presence of inhibitor or high rna purity . differential expression of the 26s ribosomal rna gene and the second s-adenosylmethionine synthetase  <dig> gene was confirmed, but only in one of the four biological replications. possible reasons of these findings are a) false positive results in microarray experiments, b) pooled performance  of array data as compared to analysis of pooled technical but separate biological replications for qrt, or c) low fold change values from microarray experiments , which might be difficult to reproduce by other methods if close to the significance threshold. similar findings were reported by czechowski et al.  <cit>  and dallas et al.  <cit> , who indicated that only genes with higher expression levels from microarray experiments  are likely to be validated by qrt-pcr.

molecular mechanisms of plant response reaction to virus invasion
candidate genes identified in this study were annotated according to maize gene ontology assignment to three major groups: genes encoding catalytic activity , genes with molecular function unknown, and genes encoding transporter activity . catalysis provides chemical energy required for maintenance of living cells and is of particular importance for the plant while delimiting pathogen invasion. catalytic activity of oxidoreductase  has been speculated to be crucial for the survival of host plants, since it is required for energy transduction, operation of many anabolic and catabolic pathways, nutrient assimilation, and for defence against disease organisms  <cit> .

one of the functions of redox activity is the formation of hydrogen peroxide , which generates a response to pathogen attack and enhances cells lignification and/or structural protein polymerization, thus producing a mechanical barrier for the invader that have not yet entered the symplasm. a rapid oxidative burst of h2o <dig> production has been previously reported as a result of pathogen invasion  <cit> . moreover, apostol et al.  <cit>  speculated that h2o <dig> production may be part of a signal transduction mechanism for coordination of cellular defences. furthermore, redox reactions depend on electron supply and active oxygen species. therefore, electron transfer activity is thought to be unseparable from defence mechanisms  <cit> .

additional comparative gene annotation was based on results obtained by whitham et al.  <cit>  on arabidopsis infected with five distinct viruses, including a mosaic potyvirus. three homologous genes  were identified in the classes cell rescue, defence, death, and ageing of arabidopsis, thus indicating the reliability of microarray technology for detection of pathogenesis-related genes.

association of map positions of differentially expressed candidate genes with scmv <dig> and scmv2
a virus resistance gene needs to be expressed before pathogen invasion, in order to enable a rapid response after infection. its expression may increase further after virus attack. in previous qtl experiments  <cit> , scmv <dig>  was detectable at each scoring time point after inoculation, whereas scmv <dig> became first detectable and induced at later scoring stages. assuming that both scmv <dig> and scmv <dig> are single genes, clustering of differentially expressed genes in the scmv <dig> and scmv <dig> genomes regions could either be due to linkage drag of genes located in the polymorphic regions in isogenic line contrasts without effect on scmv resistance , or clustering of genes involved in scmv resistance in the scmv <dig> and/or scmv <dig> regions. assuming that each of the two donor segments is  <dig> cm long, both regions would represent 5% of the total genome . the percentage of candidate genes  falling into either the scmv <dig>  or scmv <dig> bins  is 8% , which is not significantly different from the 0-hypothesis tested by the x <dig> test . thus, no evidence of clustering of differentially expressed genes in the scmv <dig> and scmv <dig> regions was found, which also means, that differential gene expression of genes due to linkage drag was limited. moreover, finding  <dig> out of  <dig> gene locations in agreement with the scmv <dig> and scmv <dig> genome locations is not significantly different from expectations based on probability theory. thus, colocalization of differentially expressed genes is only a weak indicator for candidacy of being scmv <dig> or scmv <dig> 

time course data
in contrast to fungi and bacteria, viruses are directly transferred by specific vectors into host cells. the infection cycle includes virus disassembly, rna translation and replication, new viral particle assembly, and movement. the time required for these processes may vary and be virus/host dependent.

immediate response of plants against virus attack is obligatory for fast activation of defence mechanisms  <cit> . significant differential expression of majority of genes in our study one hour post inoculation, dropping down to about one-third twelve hours post inoculation may be a result of such rapid responses of host plant to viral infection. the anticipation of detected genes in mechanical stress responses proved insignificant in applied mock control experiment.

to arque our statement we present the potyvirus study of maule et al.  <cit> , where induction of genes related to pathogenesis  and to general stress responses was detected immediately after inoculation, similar to the study of love et al.  <cit> . furthermore, marathe et al.  <cit> , detected robust plant resistance responses at transcriptome level to potyvirus infection at early  time points. changes in gene expression due to responses initiated by specific interactions between virus and host proteins, for instance potyvirus coat protein vpg with plant eif <dig> initiation factor have also been reported  <cit> . moreover, rapid silencing and blockade of viral protein expression by modified rnai was observed within one-two hours post inoculation  <cit> . in contrast, however yang et al.  <cit>  concluded that changes in gene expression depend on virus type and its accumulation  in infected tissues hence occur rather at later stages post inoculation. similarly, whitham et al.  <cit>  stated that actual transcriptional changes depend on the progress of viral infection.

the conflicting observations of different research groups might be due to host-virus system specificity and need to be studied in more detail, before generalizations can be made.

candidate genes and their involvement in signal transduction pathways
metallothioneins are known to be involved in metal binding/metabolism and detoxification reactions in animals and yeasts  <cit> . slightly modified functions of metallothioneins have been reported in plants, where their increased expression was observed in senesced leaflet and abscission zones, under ethylene induction, or as a consequence of mechanical wounding when infecting tobacco with tmv virus was obsereved  <cit> . moreover, a possible role of metallothioneins in controlling intracellular redox potential and activation of oxygen detoxification, a common strategy used by plants after pathogen invasion was suggested by hamer  <cit> . finding of metallothionein-like protein expressed in all time points  and for both viruses may suggest its differential expression as a cause of mechanical wounding. however, its participation in pathogen control cannot be ruled out.

s-adenosylmethionine synthetase is a key enzyme involved in generation of s-adenosylmethionine from methionine. s-adenosylmethionine is a major methyl donor in plants involved in polyamin and ethylene biosynthesis as well as in methylation reactions modifying lipids, proteins and nucleic acids  <cit> . ethylene plays an important role in various plant disease resistance pathways. it has originally been considered a stress hormone due to its synthesis induced by stress signals, such as mechanical wounding, chemicals and metals, drought, extreme temperatures, and pathogen infection  <cit> . some pathogens can induce plant defence responses via activation of the ethylene signal transduction pathway, whereas plants deficient in ethylene signalling may show either increased susceptibility or increased resistance  <cit> . alternatively, methylation of the fully susceptible f <dig> ss/ss genotype might be reduced as revealed in our study by the upregulation of s-adenosylmethonine synthetase isoforms  in all other genotypes. resistance to scmv and mdmv might depend on the methylation status of the plant, relating to post-transcriptional gene silencing mediated by hen <dig> like methyltransferase  <cit> .

germins are water-soluble proteins expressed during seed germination in very young seedlings of wheat and barley. in mature leaves they are induced in response to pathogen attack  <cit> . in plants other than wheat and barley, sequences related to germins are termed "germin-like". germins and germin-like proteins were isolated from hot pepper during resistance response to bacterial and viral infection  <cit> . pathogen response functions of germins were discovered with the identification of germin as an oxalate oxidase generating hydrogen peroxide. h2o <dig> is a catalyst of cell-wall reinforcement  and a basis for defence reactions in higher plants. the specific-pathogen-response oxo transcript was found in the wall of barley mesophyll cells six hours after inoculation with powdery mildew  <cit> . however, it is still unclear if germin-like proteins also have oxalate-oxidase activity and if their biological function is comparable to germins  <cit> .

a common feature of expression patterns of genes in the resistant genotype f <dig> rr/rr is lack of signs of oxidative damage , whereas partially resistant and susceptible genotypes showed upregulation of genes controlling production of hydrogen peroxide. furthermore, oxidative damage could affect chloroplasts, perturbing their proper function as shown for response to plum pox potyvirus  <cit> . the analysis of scmv cylindrical inclusion  virus protein , known to be involved in virus replication and cell-to-cell movement  <cit> , with the chlorop 1_ <dig> cbs tool  revealed a possible chloroplast transit peptide of  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . this could explain upregulation of the 14-3- <dig> proteins  in genotypes other than the fully resistant genotype f <dig> rr/rr. 14-3- <dig> proteins are known to target the transit peptide to the chloroplast, where it will be cleaved upon entrance as shown for other potyvirus  <cit> .

the putative antiviral function of 26s ribosomal rna gene in ribosome depurination and blocking of translation of viral genetic materials was reported by taylor et al.  <cit> . other genes putatively related to pathogenesis, coding for example a calcium dependent protein kinase, cytochrome c, a zinc finger protein, a peroxidase precursor, an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, 40s ribosomal protein or eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e, were identified in our microarray assay. the involvement of calcium dependent protein kinase  in defence signalling has been investigated in transgenic tobacco cell cultures, where cdpk was found to be activated in avr9/cf- <dig> gene-for-gene-dependent signal transduction, as well as in tobacco leaves after avr9/cf- <dig> interaction and hypoosmotic stress  <cit> . its participation in signal transduction pathways in arabidopsis infected with cucumber mosaic virus was demonstrated by marathe et al.  <cit> . cytochrome c has been previously reported to give an apoptotic-like response under agrobacterium infection of maize suspension cells and was called a cell death inducer released from mitochondria during ros-induced programmed cell death in plants  <cit> . furthermore, zinc finger proteins were found to be induced by various types of stresses , under viral and fungal inoculation  <cit> . an arabidopsis zinc-finger protein encoded by the lsd <dig> gene acts as a negative regulator of hypersensitive response to restrict the spreading of cell death  <cit> . class iii peroxidases  participate in lignification, suberization, wound healing and defence against pathogen infection. increased mrna levels of pox and its increased activity was previously reported in plants upon mechanical wounding in various plants  <cit> ,  <cit> . finally, altered expression of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, 40s ribosomal protein, and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e were identified under infection with various potyviruses  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, based on the results of our custom microarray, the majority of differentially expressed genes belong to the oxidative and methylation pathways, as well as pathways involved in primary and secondary responses to virus attack. oxidative insensitivity and methylation status of the f <dig> rr/rr genotype seem to play important roles for resistance to scmv and mdmv, pointing towards post-transcriptional gene silencing as major underlying defence mechanism.

the presented data indicate successful identification of similar expression patterns between mono- and dicotyledonous species and deliver new insights into the defense response mechanisms of monocot plants against potyviruses. in future, application of complementary technologies, such as transgenic approaches, infection studies with potyviruses including green fluorescent protein, virus-induced gene silencing or global proteome profiling will allow further and in-depth verification of the data.
