BACKGROUND
drought stress imposes one of the greatest limitations to crop growth and yield worldwide  <cit> . limitations in fresh water availability are predicted to become an increasing problem due to industrialization and continuing global climate change  <cit> . one of the central mechanisms in plant drought tolerance is a reduction in stomatal apertures at the leaf surface, with consequent increase in water use efficiency  <cit> . abscisic acid  is a major plant hormone which inhibits growth and promotes tolerance of abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity and cold  <cit> . under drought conditions, plants synthesize and redistribute aba which triggers cellular responses in guard cells, specialized cells that flank the stomatal pores, leading to inhibition of stomatal opening and promotion of stomatal closure and thereby reducing plant water loss. thus, an improved understanding of guard cell responses to aba is relevant for development of cultivars with improved productivity under drought conditions.

guard cells also have become an advanced model system for understanding plant signal transduction  <cit> . much of the research on guard cell responses has focused on the signaling cascades underlying rapid responses to aba as well as to other inputs such as light and co <dig>  <cit> . however, in addition to these post-transcriptional responses, guard cells also respond to aba at the level of the transcriptome. for example, li et al. showed in vicia faba guard cell protoplasts that these cells respond with an increase in dehydrin transcript levels after just  <dig> min. of aba exposure  <cit> , suggesting that some of the cellular signaling processes that are observed could be influenced by transcriptional events. leonhardt et al. published an expression analysis of the aba-related transcriptome of guard cell protoplasts  <cit> , utilizing the affymetrix ag genechip, which represents ~ <dig> arabidopsis genes. in those experiments, whole plants were treated with  <dig> μm aba for four hours, and transcriptional inhibitors were applied during the protoplasting process, with the idea of stabilizing transcript levels. the authors demonstrated aba-regulation of approximately  <dig> genes in guard cell protoplasts. to extend the investigation of gene expression in guard cells, yang et al. isolated guard cell promoter candidates based on  <dig> arabidopsis guard cell microarrays from  <dig> different treatments using whole-genome affymetrix ath <dig> chips  <cit> , which profile ~ <dig>  genes.

to date, however, there has been no systematic replicated study that investigates aba regulation of gene expression in guard cells in a genome-wide manner. a comprehensive analysis of the global aba-related transcriptome of guard cells and its relationship to known guard-cell signaling cascades promises to engender new insights into the basic cell biology of guard cells. in addition, the wealth of microarray data regarding aba-regulated transcriptomes of other tissues, including whole plants  <cit> , seedlings  <cit> , and seeds  <cit> , provides an opportunity to assess the extent to which the specialized guard cells employ unique vs. common promoter motifs and unique vs. common gene targets in aba regulation of gene expression. given growing evidence of hormonal cross-talk in physiological responses  <cit> , another interesting question is whether or not aba-regulated transcripts of guard cells are regulated by other hormones in other plant tissues. finally, manipulation of transcriptional regulation of key genes is one of the most common approaches utilized in applied research aimed at improving plant stress tolerance  <cit> , so genome-wide analysis of the arabidopsis guard cell transcriptome may yield candidate genes for translational research. in this study, we performed a systematic microarray analysis of gene expression profile data from global transcriptomes of guard cells generated with affymetrix ath <dig> chips to explore the above topics.

RESULTS
identification of aba-responsive genes in guard cells and leaves
we and others  <cit>  have observed that when guard cell protoplasts were used as the source of rna, stress-induced genes could be induced by protoplasting, even without aba treatment. therefore, we employed a protocol  <cit>  whereby isolated epidermal peels with guard cells as the only intact cell type  were used as the source of guard cell rna for microarray analysis.

for each tissue by treatment combination , three independent biological samples were assessed using affymetrix whole genome ath <dig> chips  <cit> . for the present study, to reliably identify aba-responsive genes, we adopted two different methods - a boolean method  <cit>  and a standard linear model method  <cit>  - and focused on the set of aba-regulated genes jointly confirmed by both approaches . through this overlapping analysis we identified  <dig> aba-responsive genes in col  guard cells  and  <dig> aba-responsive genes in col leaves . the aba-regulated genes in guard cells and leaves are listed in additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  respectively. as shown in figure 1c and 1d, among all the aba-induced genes, only  <dig> genes are aba-induced in both guard cells and leaves, while the rest show differential regulation with respect to tissue type. the overlap of guard cell aba-repressed genes and leaf aba-repressed genes is even smaller with only  <dig> genes common to both guard cells and leaves. there are only  <dig> genes that are oppositely regulated by aba in guard cells vs. leaves: at5g <dig>  exl <dig> , and cil  are induced by aba in guard cells but repressed by aba in leaves, and kcs <dig>  is induced by aba in leaves but repressed by aba in guard cells.

validation of aba-responsive genes from microarray analysis by q-pcr
to evaluate the reliability of aba-regulation derived from the microarray data and validate identified aba-responsive genes, we performed q-pcr experiments on  <dig> genes identified as not responsive to aba and  <dig> genes that showed differential expression in response to aba in either guard cells, leaves, or both tissues by our microarray analysis . the three negative control genes were actin , a β-tubulin like protein tub <dig> , and a putative nematode resistant protein arabidopsis ortholog of sugar beet hs <dig> pro- <dig>  <dig> . among the aba-responsive genes, we chose two genes that exhibited aba-upregulation in both guard cells and leaves in our microarray analysis: abi <dig> , which encodes one of several pp2c-type protein phosphatases that negatively regulate many aspects of aba signaling, including aba-induced stomatal closure  <cit> , and the non-specific lipid transfer protein  <dig> , which is a drought-responsive gene  <cit> . in addition, we analyzed two genes that showed aba-repression in both guard cell and leaf microarrays: a heat shock protein  and a somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinase  <dig> . for the category of aba-induction in guard cell but not leaf microarrays, five genes were chosen for q-pcr evaluation: lti78/rd29a , identified as a cold and salt stress-induced gene in a leaf transcription study  <cit> , two genes encoding phospholipases known to be involved in aba signaling, namely a phospholipase c gene, pi-plc  and a pldδ homolog , as well as gbf <dig> , and a protein kinase . for genes that showed aba-repression in guard cell but not leaf microarrays, we performed q-pcr assessment of a vacuolar anion channel gene atclc-a  and the ion channel gene kat <dig> , which mediates k+ uptake during stomatal opening. for genes that were aba-responsive only in the leaf microarrays, we tested eceriferum  <dig>  and ca2+-binding protein  <dig>  for aba-induced genes and wall-associated kinase  <dig>  for aba-repressed genes.

cis-acting regulatory elements in aba-responsive genes
several cis-regulatory elements responsible for mediating aba-, drought-, and cold-induced gene expression have been identified by biochemical and molecular techniques  <cit> . we were interested to determine whether these known motifs would be enriched in our gene sets, which would support our identification of these genes as aba-regulated. in addition, we were interested to assess whether aba-regulated genes of guard cells and leaves would exhibit differential usage of these promoter motifs, or differential positioning of the motifs within the promoter region.

the g-box-containing aba-responsive elements  and coupling element  <dig>  are classical cis-acting elements in aba-responsive gene expression  <cit> . in addition, the core motif of the dehydration-responsive element/c-repeat  is a cis-acting element found in many drought-, high-salt- and cold-responsive genes in arabidopsis and rice, and provides the binding site for dre-related transcription factors such as dre-binding proteins   <cit> . myb and myc binding motifs are also found in the promoters of drought-inducible genes. proteins of the myb and myc families function in mediating drought- and aba-regulated gene expression  <cit>  and some members of these families such as atmyc <dig> and atmyb <dig> are synthesized following accumulation of endogenous aba  <cit> . other related cis-acting elements include the binding site of c-repeat factors  and the low temperature responsive element   <cit> .

we performed a statistical analysis  of the promoter sequences  of aba-responsive genes in guard cells and leaves, to check whether the known motifs would be enriched in our gene sets. the results of this analysis are shown in table  <dig>  we can see that abres are significantly enriched in guard cell aba-induced genes. in particular, more than 50% of aba-induced genes in guard cells have abres in their promoter regions, supporting the reliability of our microarray methods and predictions. dres and ltres are also highly enriched in guard cell aba-induced genes. abres and the cold-related cis-acting element ltre, but not dre/crt elements are also highly enriched in leaf aba-induced genes. a motif over-represented in light-induced promoters, gccac , also is found to be highly enriched in guard cell aba-regulated genes but not in leaves. compared with other motifs, ce <dig> has only a few matches in the aba-regulated genes of either sample type. this is consistent with the findings that ce <dig> is well-represented in rice but almost absent in arabidopsis  <cit> . none of the cis-acting elements enriched in aba-induced genes is significantly enriched in aba-repressed genes of guard cells or leaves, except the myc binding site and ltre. the mechanisms of aba-repression are less well characterized than those for induction  <cit>  and motifs specific for aba-repressed genes may exist but have not been revealed yet .

'all genes' means all genes represented in the affymetrix ath <dig> chips. "gc_up" and "gc_down" represent aba-induced and aba-repressed genes in guard cells, respectively. "lf_up" and "lf_down" mean aba-induced and aba-repressed genes in leaves, respectively. the numbers in brackets in the header denote the total number of aba-regulated genes in the corresponding category. p-values smaller than  <dig>  are marked in bold.

we also examined the positional preference of the cis-acting regulatory elements abre, dre, cbf and ltre in a 1000-bp region upstream of identified aba-regulated genes of guard cells and leaves . there is no significant difference between abre locations in guard cell vs. leaf genes ; the same is true for the cis-acting elements dre, cbf and ltre locations in guard cell genes and leaf genes . the positional distribution of these four elements upstream of guard cell aba-induced genes is shown in figure 3b. abres are more likely than the other three motifs to be located in regions close to transcription start sites , with around 28% and 20% abres located in the -100~-50-bp region upstream of the tss in guard cell and leaf aba-induced genes, respectively.

identification of new promoter motifs
in guard cells,  <dig> of the aba-induced genes have none of the known motifs of table  <dig> in their promoter regions, and this is also true for  <dig> of the genes induced by aba in leaves. in addition, not all genes containing a known aba-related promoter motif show aba-regulation in both tissue types. accordingly, we sought to identify possible new motifs that may be involved in aba-regulated gene expression, particularly of a cell-specific nature. we were also interested in the possibility of identifying repression-specific motifs. we identified all 5-10mer motifs highly enriched in the 1000-bp sequences upstream of aba-regulated genes in guard cells and leaves , and also compared their enrichment in previously published aba-regulated gene sets. the statistically significant 5-mer motifs are summarized in table  <dig>  these motifs include not only the core of g-box-containing abres , subsequences of abres, the ltre , and the light-induced motif , as expected from the above analysis, but also some new, previously unidentified, motifs. the results for 5-10mer motifs also show that there are many more significant motifs in aba-induced genes than in aba-repressed genes. in addition, a greater number of distinct motifs were found in guard cell aba-induced genes than in leaf aba-induced genes.

motifs marked in bold are subsequences of abre considered in table  <dig>  underlined motifs exhibit tissue specificity  based on our analysis . for convenient comparison of gc and lf, p-values falling beyond the thresholds  are also listed. amotifs appearing in more than  <dig> loci are not listed.

to check whether newly identified 5-mer motifs significantly enriched in our gene sets are guard cell- or leaf-specific, we merged previously published aba-regulated gene sets in arabidopsis from  <cit>  and compared the enrichment of these motifs. note that none of these studies uses guard cells or rosette leaves as plant materials. we calculated the enrichment p-values of these motifs in the merged aba-regulated gene set using all genes in the whole genome as the background, and also calculated the enrichment of these motifs in our gene sets using the merged aba-regulated gene set as the background. the results are shown in table s <dig> and table s <dig> in additional file  <dig>  respectively. guard cell-specific or leaf-specific motifs are designated as those that are not significantly enriched in the above merged aba-regulated gene set, but are still significant in our guard cell or leaf aba-regulated gene set when using the merged aba-regulated gene set as the background. we find that gtcgg, which is not a subsequence of any known motifs, is significantly enriched in guard cell aba-induced genes using either all genes in the whole genome or the merged aba-regulated gene set as the background. by contrast, the enrichment of gtcgg in the merged aba-regulated gene set is not significant . we accordingly identify gtcgg as a potential guard cell-specific motif involved in aba-induced gene expression. similarly, tgcaa is a potential leaf-specific motif involved in aba-repressed gene expression.

although only a few motifs emerge as significant from the promoters of aba-repressed genes, in our analysis we find a novel strong candidate for a repression-specific motif, caagttg, which is enriched in both guard cell aba-repressed genes and leaf aba-repressed genes . this motif is very similar to the motif caacttg identified in  <cit> , but in our guard cell and leaf gene sets, the enrichment of caagttg is stronger than that of caacttg . known aba-repressed genes kat <dig> and myb <dig>  <cit>  contain the caagttg motif. to examine whether this motif is also enriched in aba-repressed genes in other tissues/cell types, we collected eight aba-repressed gene sets from  <cit> , and compared this motif's enrichment in these aba-repressed gene sets . as shown in figure  <dig>  caagttg is highly enriched in the upstream sequences of most of the eight aba-repressed gene sets, and the combined motif caattg is consistently enriched in all aba-repressed gene sets, which further supports its involvement in aba-mediated gene repression.

comparison with other aba transcriptome studies
many transcriptome studies have been conducted on aba regulation of gene expression in different arabidopsis tissues and cell types, including whole plants  <cit> , seedlings  <cit> , seeds  <cit> , and one previous study reporting aba responsive genes in guard cells and mesophyll cells using a partial-genome  affymetrix chip  <cit> .  <dig> aba-induced genes and  <dig> aba-repressed genes are obtained by merging the aba-responsive genes in these studies. we examined how many of the aba-regulated genes that we identified from our guard cell transcriptomes can be found in this merged aba-regulated gene set. the overlap of our aba-regulated genes with the previously published aba-regulated genes is shown in figure  <dig>  we find that  <dig> % of the aba-induced genes and  <dig> % aba-repressed genes in guard cells identified in this work are found in previous aba transcriptome studies. in leaves,  <dig> % of aba-induced genes and  <dig> % aba-repressed genes are found in previous aba transcriptome studies. such significant overlap supports the reliability of our microarray analysis.

in addition to the overall comparison, we also conducted a pairwise comparison of the  <dig> aba transcriptome studies mentioned above and our study, which describe a total of  <dig> different aba-regulated transcriptomes  . these transcriptome experiments have been done under various experimental conditions, including different aba doses and treatment durations, tissue/cell types, microarray platforms, plant developmental stages, and methods for identifying aba-regulated genes. a summary of experimental conditions for these aba transcriptome studies is given in table s <dig> . the pairwise overlaps are measured by percentage  and representation factor , and their significance is examined by the hypergeometric distribution. the results are shown in figure s <dig> . given the diversity of experimental parameters, it is not surprising that these studies do not have very high pairwise overlap percentages for aba-regulated genes. however, when compared with random overlaps, all of them are significant for aba-induced genes. for aba-repressed gene sets, all have significant pairwise overlaps as compared with the expected overlap of two random sets except for the aba-repressed gene sets in  <cit>  which have non-significant overlaps with several other studies. figure  <dig> shows the cumulative number of aba-regulated genes that are common to different numbers of experiments. as expected from the pairwise overlap analysis, there are not many aba-induced genes found in common as the number of experiments increases, and there are no aba-repressed genes that are common to > <dig> experiments . however, despite the diversity in tissue types, aba treatments, and transcriptome platforms utilized in these experiments, we were able to find a "core set" of ~ <dig> aba-induced genes reported in any  <dig> out of  <dig> experiments , and a similar number of "core set" aba-repressed genes reported in any  <dig> out of  <dig> experiments . table  <dig> lists the core set of aba-induced genes, and table  <dig> lists the core set of aba-repressed genes.

the first column lists the agi locus identifiers of the genes. *genes that appear in our guard cell aba-induced gene set. ^genes that appear in leonhardt et al.'s guard cell aba-induced gene set  <cit> . the genes that appear in our aba-induced gene set are marked with underlines if they are not represented on the affymetrix ~8k chips used in  <cit> . the second column gives brief tair descriptions for the genes. the third column indicates the number of experiments that the genes are found common to.

identification of new guard cell aba-responsive genes
in addition to identifying core sets of aba-induced and aba-repressed genes, we also discovered a number of novel aba-responsive genes in both guard cells and leaves. in particular, our results provide a valuable comprehensive source of aba-regulated genes in guard cells since the smaller affymetrix ~8k array was used in  <cit>  and therefore could not provide information on ~2/ <dig> of the transcriptome. for example, among  <dig> genes significantly aba-regulated in our guard cell transcriptome,  <dig> genes  were not previously reported to be aba-regulated by leonhardt et al.  <cit> . of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> aba-induced genes and  <dig> aba-repressed genes were also not reported as aba-regulated in any of the  <dig> previous transcriptome studies we analyzed . the proposed guard cell-specific aba-induction motif, gtcgg, is significantly enriched  in the  <dig> newly identified aba-induced genes of guard cells, consistent with the hypothesis that this motif participates in aba-regulation of gene expression in guard cells. we also identified a smaller set of aba-regulated transcripts in leaves that have not been reported in the previous aba microarray studies:  <dig> aba-induced genes and  <dig> aba-repressed genes. in table  <dig> and table  <dig> we list by p-value the top  <dig> new aba-induced genes and aba-repressed genes in guard cells not previously reported by any of the  <dig> previous aba microarray studies that we evaluated. additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig> list all the new aba-responsive genes in guard cells and leaves, respectively.

the fold changes are calculated by averaging three biological replicates and comparing the average expression values with aba treatment to those without aba treatment. the genes with underlines also appear in our leaf aba-induced genes.

functional enrichment in aba-responsive genes
aba is involved in a myriad of biological processes, including plant growth and development, and plant responses to environmental stresses such as cold, drought, and pathogens. to examine whether aba-responsive genes identified in our study tend to be involved in such aspects of plant physiology, we used the go functional analysis tool bingo  <dig>  embedded in the cytoscape project  <cit>  to functionally categorize our aba-responsive genes in guard cells and leaves. tair <dig> go data   <cit>  for the whole arabidopsis gene annotation were used as the reference set. the significance of overrepresentation and underrepresentation of a functional category was calculated by the hypergeometric cumulative distribution. bonferroni familywise error rate  correction was applied for multiple testing. the functional categories with p-values less than  <dig> e- <dig> that also have fwer -corrected p-values smaller than  <dig>  are given in figure  <dig> 

for the aba-induced genes, the three most significant functional categories in both guard cells and leaves are response to abiotic stimulus, response to endogenous stimulus, and response to stress , all consistent with the fact that aba plays important roles in the regulation of gene expression during stress responses. lipid metabolic process, catalytic activity and secondary metabolic process are also enriched in both guard cell and leaf aba-induced genes but the enrichment of vacuole and transcription factor activity is unique to guard cells. in addition, several functional categories are underrepresented within aba-induced genes, including translation, rna binding, protein metabolism, and nucleobase metabolism .

aba-repressed genes show enrichment of different functional categories than aba-induced genes . the functional categories enriched in both guard cell and leaf aba-repressed genes are plastid, transferase activity, plasma membrane, and nucleotide binding. response to abiotic stimulus, response to stress and several other functional categories are highly enriched in guard cell aba-repressed genes but not in leaf aba-repressed genes. two functional categories, nucleobase metabolic process and protein modification process, are enriched in leaf aba-repressed genes but not in guard cell aba-repressed genes. the functional categories protein metabolism, nucleobase metabolism and nucleotide binding which are underrepresented in leaf aba-induced genes are overrepresented in leaf aba-repressed genes.

guard cell signaling and development genes regulated at the transcript level by aba
a number of genes and proteins in guard cells have been revealed to function in stomatal movements in response to stimuli, including aba, co <dig>  light and pathogens. in  <cit> , a total of  <dig> guard cell signaling genes was compiled from published literature. li and assmann  <cit>  reviewed selected guard cell signaling and development genes. in addition, kwak et al. collected  <dig> guard cell signaling genes  <cit> . we combined these sets as well as  <dig> additional genes with functional guard cell roles as described by kim et al.  <cit>  and  <dig> genes involved in guard cell patterning and development as described by dong and bergmann  <cit> , to obtain a list of  <dig> known guard cell signaling or development genes/proteins . of these guard cell components,  <dig> are significantly regulated by aba at the transcript level .

cross-regulation by aba and heterotrimeric g proteins
heterotrimeric g-proteins, composed of α, β and γ subunits, participate in a wide range of crucial signaling pathways in eukaryotes  <cit> . aba signaling is known to interact with heterotrimeric g-protein signaling in both developmental and stress responses  <cit> . in a previous study, we found that aba signaling also cross-talks with g protein signaling at the level of the transcriptome  <cit> . in the present study, we used the genome-wide guard cell microarray data from wild-type, gα , gβ  and gγ double  mutant plants, with and without aba treatment to systematically investigate aba regulation of gene expression in guard cells and compared it with the aba-regulated transcriptome of leaves from the same genotypes. we identified a number of g-protein-independent aba-regulated genes and g-protein-dependent aba-regulated genes, which will facilitate the screening and identification of novel guard cell signaling genes. figure  <dig> demonstrates the heat map of expression patterns of these genes  and shows that in both guard cells and leaves the number of g-protein-independent aba-regulated genes is dominant, consistent with the fact that aba mediates many stress and developmental signaling pathways without any known participation from the heterotrimeric g protein. the number of g-protein-dependent aba-regulated genes in leaves is much larger than in guard cells, suggesting that the g-protein may be more involved in aba signaling in mesophyll cells than in guard cells. six  guard cell g-protein-dependent aba-induced genes and  <dig>  leaf g-protein-dependent aba-induced genes have abres in their promoter regions, which is statistically significant.

cross-regulation by aba and other hormones
the phenomenon of cross-talk between plant hormones is well-established at the physiological level  <cit> . nemhauser et al.  <cit>  performed an analysis of seven hormone-treated transcriptomes generated by goda et al.  <cit>  from 7-day-old arabidopsis seedlings and identified target genes regulated by the hormones abscisic acid , gibberellic acid  <dig> , indole-3-acetic acid , 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid , zeatin , brassinolide , and methyl jasmonate . six of these seven hormones both positively and negatively regulate significant numbers of genes at the transcript level, identified by stringent analysis using two different methods  <cit> , whereas the seventh hormone, ga, regulates only a few genes identified by a low-stringency linear model  <cit> . we took the intersection of the hormone-regulated gene sets identified by the rank product and linear model methods used in  <cit>  and compared our aba-regulated genes in guard cells and leaves with these hormonally regulated genes. the overlap of our aba-regulated genes with hormone-regulated gene sets was calculated both in the same direction, that is, genes up-  regulated by a hormone are compared with genes up-  regulated by another hormone, and in the antagonistic direction. representation factor and p-values calculated by the hypergeometric distribution  were used to evaluate the overlaps.

discussion
our identified aba-regulated guard cell and leaf transcriptomes are supported not only by q-pcr verification but also by their significant overlap with the aba-regulated transcriptomes of other tissues with respect to the promoter motifs that are utilized, the genes that are regulated, and the functional roles of the encoded gene products in stress tolerance as ascertained from go analysis. however, as discussed in detail below, a deeper study of these new transcriptomes reveals many interesting features.

promoters
as expected, known promoter motifs conferring aba- and stress-related gene regulation, such as abres and ltres, are over-represented in the promoters of both our guard cell and leaf aba-induced gene sets. however, promoters of aba-regulated genes of guard cells but not leaves are enriched in myb and dre/crt elements. these differences suggest differential utilization of specific transcription factors in guard cells vs. leaves. functional support for this hypothesis is offered by published analyses of myb family members and stomatal regulation. two members of the arabidopsis r2r3-myb family, myb <dig> and atmyb <dig>  are expressed in guard cells and their overexpression lines show enhancement of aba-induced stomatal closure and drought tolerance  <cit> . comparable functional data detailing guard cell roles for the dre/crt binding factors are presently lacking; our analysis of promoter motifs suggests that dre binding proteins will also be found to participate in guard cell aba responses. analyses in other tissues have shown that genes with dre elements in their promoters are regulated by dehydration but not by aba, although aba-sensitivity may be conferred by the concerted action of the dreb and abf proteins  <cit> . when our guard cell aba-regulated gene set is assessed for its complement of known transcription factors, we find that dreb1a, abf <dig> and abf <dig> show concerted aba-induction in guard cells.

we hypothesized that, given the specialized nature of guard cell responses to aba, these cells might also utilize specialized promoter motifs. one motif, gtcgg, which is not a subsequence of any known motifs, was thereby provisionally identified, awaiting functional verification. in addition, a greater number of different enriched motifs are found for guard cell aba-induced genes than for leaf aba-induced genes, suggesting that transcription factors in guard cells may target a greater diversity of cis-acting regulatory elements in aba responses as compared to those in leaves.

only a few motifs, including caagttg, emerged as significant from the promoters of aba-repressed genes. for both guard cells and leaves, there are more significant 5-10mer motifs in aba-induced genes than in aba-repressed genes. since the numbers of aba-induced and aba-repressed genes are of similar magnitude in our datasets, this result suggests that evolution may have favored a greater diversity in mechanisms for regulation of gene repression than for gene induction, thus is it more difficult for any one aba-repression motif to achieve statistical significance.

comparison with other aba transcriptome studies
the fact that many classic aba- and stress-related promoter motifs are enriched upstream of genes in our aba-regulated gene sets led us to predict that many of the genes identified by our analyses would also be present in comparable transcriptomes derived from other tissues. indeed, we find over half of all aba-regulated genes in our guard cell and leaf datasets were also identified in other studies, with the highest percentage overlap  found for aba-induced genes in our leaf gene set, probably reflecting the fact that leaf tissue is included as a component tissue  in several previous studies. on the other hand, it is interesting that there is only a single aba-regulated gene, at1g01470: lea <dig>  found in common to all aba transcriptome studies that we analyzed. this result hints that there might be greater flexibility in how tissues achieve a common end result of stress tolerance than in how they perform other functions such as primary metabolism.

despite the lack of genes found in common to all studies, we nevertheless identified core aba-regulated gene sets. many of these core aba-induced genes have already been assigned functional roles in response to aba or another stress, or are members of a family  already known to play such a role. in contrast, fewer aba-repressed genes  have known relationships to stress signaling or tolerance. taken together with the observation that it has been more difficult to identify promoter motifs for aba-repression than for aba-induction, and with the fact that we had to reduce the number of experiments to  <dig> to identify a shared set of ~ <dig> aba-repressed genes, these results suggest a greater between-tissue diversity in the roles of aba-repressed genes than those of aba-induced genes. for example, our guard cell dataset includes  <dig> of the  <dig> core aba-induced genes but only  <dig> of the  <dig> core aba-repressed genes.

during drought stress, it is optimal for guard cells to lose water to promote stomatal closure while it is optimal for other cell types to retain water to maintain cellular hydration. we therefore expected to find some aba-regulated genes unique to guard cells, and this expectation was satisfied. we identified ~ <dig> aba-induced and ~ <dig> aba-repressed genes in guard cells that were not identified as aba-regulated genes in any of  <dig> previous studies of aba-regulated transcriptomes . these genes represent potential guard cell-specific aba-regulated genes. consistent with this hypothesis, our predicted guard cell-specific motif gtcgg is significantly enriched in the upstream regions of these genes . supporting the idea that these genes may have novel, as yet undescribed aba-related functions in guard cells, many fewer genes in the lists of new and most significantly aba-regulated guard cell genes  are annotated as aba- or stress-related than in the lists of core aba-regulated genes .

additional file  <dig> provides the full list of the newly identified aba-responsive genes of guard cells. some of these genes already have been reported to be involved in stomatal movements or guard cell signaling. jar <dig>  is jasmonate resistant  <dig> and has been detected in guard cells  <cit> . this gene product has been reported to enhance ros production and aba sensitivity of guard cells  <cit>  and its expression is aba-induced in our guard cell data. other hormone-regulated genes, such as the iaa inducible gene iaa <dig>  and cytokinin response factor  <dig> crf <dig> , are also regulated by aba in guard cells according to our microarray analysis. in addition, several ca2+-related genes are identified as new aba-induced genes in guard cells, such as atcambp <dig>  and cbl <dig> . cry1/blu <dig>  encodes the blue light photoreceptor cryptochrome  <dig> and has been reported to participate in blue light-regulation of stomatal movements  <cit> , while nph <dig> functions downstream of the phot1/phot <dig> blue light photoreceptors which mediate blue light-specific stomatal opening  <cit> . our results indicate that these genes are aba-repressed in guard cells, which might contribute to the phenomenon of aba-repression of light-induced stomatal opening, particularly over a longer time scale. sucrose is a significant osmoticum maintaining stomatal opening in the afternoon  <cit> , and the sugar transporter stp <dig> has already been described as a guard cell-specific transporter that shows a peak in expression in the afternoon  <cit> , in concert with the daily timing of sucrose accumulation into guard cells  <cit> . the observed repression of stp <dig> and the putative sugar transporter at3g <dig> by aba might also contribute to long-term inhibition of stomatal opening.

go functional analysis
the go category lipid metabolic processes is over-represented in aba-induced genes of guard cells and leaves. little is known concerning the relationship between aba and lipid signaling in mesophyll cells; however, the guard cell result is consistent with functional evidence for roles of inositol phosphates  and phosphatidic acid  in aba inhibition of stomatal opening  <cit> . in fact, among aba-induced genes in this category we find at5g <dig>  a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase c family protein, and at2g <dig>  an inositol-3-phosphate synthase, as well as two pld isoforms: pldδ  and pldζ , suggesting that activation of these genes may contribute toward long-term suppression of stomatal opening under drought conditions.

conversely, several functional categories are underrepresented within the aba-induced gene sets, including translation, rna binding, protein metabolism, and nucleobase metabolism, consistent with the supposition that metabolism is generally down-regulated under stress conditions  <cit> . however, such down-regulation may be greater for leaves than for guard cells, given that go categories associated with several types of metabolic processes are over-represented in leaf but not in guard cell aba-repressed gene sets. this difference may reflect a requirement for guard cells to maintain metabolic activity and active stomatal regulation under drought conditions. one interesting observation is that the go category response to abiotic stimulus is over-represented in both aba-induced and aba-repressed guard cell genes. many of these genes are genes of known function in guard cells, and are discussed in the next section.

genes of known guard cell function, g protein regulation, and hormone cross-talk
our analysis reveals that many genes which encode proteins with known functions in guard cell physiology are also aba-regulated at the transcript level. this phenomenon was reported less robustly in a previous analysis  <cit>  which queried only ~1/ <dig> of the arabidopsis genes assayed here. changes in rates of solute transport resulting from non-transcription-related regulation of ion channels and transporters are central to rapid, osmotically-driven control of stomatal apertures  <cit> . however, our data show that many of the relevant transport proteins are regulated at the transcript level as well. transcripts encoding the h+ atpase ost <dig>  the inward k+ channels kat <dig> and kat <dig>  the sugar transporter stp <dig>  the endosomal na+/h+ antiporter chx <dig>  and the nitrate importer chl <dig> are all down-regulated in guard cells following aba treatment, suggesting that their downregulation may be an important aspect of longer-duration inhibition of stomatal opening by aba. two known genes related to guard cell development, fama  which regulates proliferation of stomatal precursors as well as differentiation of guard mother cells  <cit> , and atmpk <dig>  an environmentally responsive mitogen-activated protein kinase mediating stomatal development and patterning  <cit> , are downregulated, as are several signaling proteins. several other genes, functioning in the guard cell response to co <dig>  and pathogens , are slightly repressed by aba , although failing to meet the threshold of significance used to categorize aba-responsive genes in our microarray analyses.

aba up-regulated genes include zeaxanthin epoxidase , required for aba synthesis. in addition, up-regulation of aba-related transcription factors abf <dig>  abf <dig>  and atmyb <dig> could provide positive feedback to the aba response by promoting transcription of stress-related genes. a number of genes encoding known guard cell signaling proteins are up-regulated, including four protein phosphatase 2c's: pp2ca, hab <dig>  abi <dig>  and abi <dig>  since pp2c phosphatases are negative regulators of aba signaling, their aba-induced expression suggests instigation of negative feedback on the aba response. this supposition is supported by the converse observation that five out of six genes encoding pyr/pyl/rcar type soluble aba receptors with documented function in guard cells  <cit>  are down-regulated by aba , as are two other genes encoding positive transducers of the aba signal, the mapk mpk <dig>  and an enzyme involved in nitric oxide production, nia <dig> 

analysis of t-dna insertional mutants has implicated heterotrimeric g proteins in aba responses of diverse tissues  <cit> . mutant plants with g-protein subunit knockouts are aba hyposensitive in aspects of guard cell ion channel and stomatal regulation  <cit>  but, unexpectedly, aba hypersensitive in inhibition of seed germination and root growth  <cit> , indicating system-specificity of g-protein effectors. interestingly, the leaf transcriptome actually has more genes co-regulated by aba and g-proteins than the guard cell transcriptome. this result suggests important but as yet unidentified functions of aba/g-protein co-regulation in mesophyll cell physiology. conversely, in guard cells, this result implies that non-aba related functions of g-proteins should be investigated. indeed, based on phenotypes of gpa <dig> mutants, g-proteins also participate in co <dig> and pathogen responses of guard cells  <cit> .

our results indicate that signaling cross-talk also occurs at the transcript level between aba and other plant hormones. aba-regulated and mj-regulated genes identified by nemhauser et al.  <cit>  each have highly significant overlap with our aba-regulated genes in both guard cells and leaves, and this is consistent with aba-mj crosstalk at the physiological level, in both guard cells  <cit>  and other tissues  <cit> . in addition, a few genes designated as marker genes for hormones other than aba in  <cit>  are found to be significantly aba-regulated in our transcriptomes. it is possible that the previous analysis  <cit>  was confounded by the use of whole arabidopsis seedlings as the material for microarray analysis, which may have masked hormonal co-regulation occurring in specific tissue or cell types. although our evaluation of overlap is limited to one hormone , these results nevertheless indicate that the conclusion of  <cit> , that plant hormones do not regulate common gene sets, merits re-assessment. our work provides a starting point to re-assess core hormone regulatory modules and hormone marker genes.

CONCLUSIONS
this microarray analysis investigates aba regulation of gene expression in guard cells in a systematic genome-wide manner. a number of aba-regulated genes of guard cells identified here overlap with aba-regulated genes of other tissues while a subset of them show aba-regulation unique to this cell type. a unique cis-acting motif, gtcgg, associated with aba-induction of gene expression specifically in guard cells, was identified at the bioinformatic level. many of the genes known to encode ion transporters associated with stomatal opening are down-regulated by aba, providing one mechanism for long-term maintenance of stomatal closure during drought. we also found examples of both negative and positive feedback in the transcriptional regulation by aba of known aba-signaling genes, particularly with regard to the pyr/pyl/rcar class of soluble aba receptors and their downstream targets, the type 2c protein phosphatases. in conclusion, the results of this study engender new insights into the basic cell biology of guard cells, reveal common and unique elements of aba-regulation of gene expression in guard cells, and set the stage for targeted biotechnological manipulations to improve plant water use efficiency.
