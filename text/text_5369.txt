BACKGROUND
haemophilus influenzae is a fastidious, gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, opportunistic pathogen, and is found only in man where it is a common commensal in the nasopharynx  <cit> . h.influenzae is a frequent cause of both invasive and non-invasive diseases including epiglottitis, pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, respiratory infections and otitis media   <cit> . om due to h. influenzae is principally caused by nontypeable h. influenzae  strains  <cit> , while invasive disease can be caused by either encapsulated or unencapsulated strains. of the six biochemically and antigenically distinct capsular types , h. influenzae serotype b  strains accounted for the vast majority of bacteremia and meningitis cases prior to the introduction of vaccines based on the type b capsule  <cit> . while such vaccines have nearly eradicated meningitis caused by type b strains in the developed world  <cit> , they lack effectiveness against other capsular types  <cit>  and against nontypeable strains  <cit>  which remain a significant public health issue.

h. influenzae has an absolute aerobic growth requirement for heme; since most strains of h. influenzae possess the enzyme ferrochelatase, the requirement is specifically for the immediate heme precursor protoporphyrin ix   <cit> . in the human host, heme is intracellular in the form of globins or other heme containing proteins, and thus unavailable to invading microorganisms. however, h. influenzae is able to use many potential host derived hemoproteins to satisfy its heme requirements, including hemoglobin, hemoglobin-haptoglobin, myoglobin-haptoglobin, heme-hemopexin, heme-albumin and catalase  <cit> . in addition h. influenzae can grow when supplied with ppix in the presence of an iron source such as ferri-transferrin  <cit> .

the mechanisms mediating utilization of these various heme and iron sources by h. influenzae are complex and highly redundant. our current understanding of the h. influenzae heme and iron acquisition systems is summarized in figure  <dig> and has recently been reviewed by morton and stull  <cit> . several of the heme acquisition associated proteins have been shown to be involved in virulence in animal models of both invasive and non-invasive h. influenzae disease  <cit> . significant gaps remain in our understanding of h. influenzae iron/heme acquisition, and the elucidation of the core iron and/or heme  modulon of h. influenzae will potentially provide additional valuable insights into the mechanisms involved in the utilization of these essential nutrients.

since iron and heme sources are sequestered within the human host  <cit> , it is likely that the host microenvironment will result in the increased expression of h. influenzae proteins encoded by genes preferentially transcribed during growth in fehm-restricted media in vitro. evidence for this is provided by our previous report of transcription of several h. influenzae fehm-acquisition associated genes in middle ear effusions from patients with om  <cit> . identification of the fehm regulated genes in h. influenzae would thus potentially further elucidate the fehm acquisition pathways as well as identify previously unknown virulence determinants.

we previously reported a microarray based study to identify the fehm-responsive genes of the sequenced h. influenzae isolate rd kw <dig>  <cit> . both this previous study, as well as the current one, examine the effect of iron and heme together since it is not currently technically possible to separate the effects of these two molecules on transcription  <cit> . the previous study identified in excess of  <dig> genes that were significantly upregulated under fehm restricted conditions. many of these genes have been previously studied and been associated with fehm uptake, utilization and/or homeostasis. other identified genes had defined roles in metabolism while several additional genes were uncharacterized. however, since the type d parent of rd kw <dig> was originally isolated over  <dig> years ago  <cit>  and has undergone extensive passaging on laboratory media, this isolate is unlikely to be representative of clinically important strains and may even be altered in its regulation of gene expression. indeed, since rd kw <dig> is derived from a type d strain and was selected as a rough derivative following loss of the capsule, at least one major genetic event has occurred since primary isolation  <cit> . thus, it is important to examine the fehm modulons of more representative clinical isolates. two invasive isolates were selected for further microarray analysis, the serotype b isolate  <dig> was from a patient with meningitis  <cit>  and the nthi strain r <dig> isolated from the blood of an immunocompetent child with clinical signs of meningitis subsequent to acute om  <cit> . the primary goal of these studies is to begin to define the core set of genes preferentially transcribed under fehm limitation in clinically important isolates of h. influenzae and thereby identify potential therapeutic and vaccine targets expressed broadly across the species.

RESULTS
q-pcr analysis: derepression of transcription in fehm restricted media
since our goal was the identification of genes that are preferentially transcribed under conditions of fehm limitation, it was necessary to first describe the kinetics of transcription of genes known to be fehm repressible in the two clinical isolates. genes encoding the periplasmic iron-binding protein hita, the transferrin-binding protein tbpa and the heme/hemopexin uptake protein hxuc were utilized for this purpose. transcript levels were determined by q-pcr following introduction of bacteria into either fehm-replete or fehm-restricted media for each experimental isolate  essentially as described previously for strain rd kw <dig>  <cit> . figure 2a shows transcription of tbp <dig> in the hib strain  <dig> over a  <dig> minute period following introduction of cells into the test media. the transcript levels of tbp <dig> increased to a plateau level within  <dig> minutes of growth in the fehm-restricted media  but remained at the baseline level during growth in fehm-replete media. thus, growth in fehm-deplete media promoted transcription of this gene. to ensure that the lack of increase in transcripts in the fehm-replete media was not due to cell death, viable counts were taken at each time point. the viable count data demonstrated that strain  <dig> retained viability for the duration of the experiment in both fehm-replete and -restricted cultures . transcript levels of hita and hxuc exhibited profiles similar to that observed for the tbp <dig> transcripts . transcription of these three genes in strain r <dig> was essentially the same . replicate experiments conducted on different occasions established that the time course of change in transcript levels, magnitude of transcriptional changes and growth profiles were consistent and reproducible for both hib  <dig> and nthi r <dig> 

q-pcr analysis: repression of transcription in fehm supplemented media
having determined the time course and conditions of maximal transcription of the three fehm-repressible genes in the two clinical isolates, we next examined the time course of repression of transcription of these same genes in order to determine the minimal time window required to detect maximal differential regulation. the kinetics of repression of hita, tbp <dig> and hxuc by fehm were determined in the following way for each clinical isolate. three flasks were prepared and inoculated with a given strain. two of these flasks contained fehm-restricted media  while the third flask was fehm supplemented . each set of flasks was inoculated with the respective isolate, and samples  taken at  <dig> minute intervals for rna isolation and q-pcr analysis. after  <dig> minutes of incubation, fehm  was added to one of the flasks containing fehm-restricted media and samples were removed at  <dig> minute intervals from each of the three flasks for rna isolation. between flask comparisons of the hita, tbp <dig> and hxuc transcript levels determined by q-pcr analysis demonstrated that marked differences were associated with the timing of fehm supplementation. fehm supplementation from the outset led to no increase in transcripts over the duration of the experiment. conversely, the fehm-restricted cultures displayed increased transcription of hita, tbp <dig> and hxuc consistent with that observed in the previous experiment. in the fehm-restricted environment the transcription of hita, tbp <dig> and hxuc increased with a similar profile under the two conditions, until the addition of exogenous fehm at  <dig> minutes at which point a very rapid decrease in the transcript levels was observed. within  <dig> minutes following this addition the transcript levels of genes under this condition were indistinguishable from those in cultures containing fehm throughout. for simplicity, figure 3a shows only the data for the fold changes in transcripts of the hita gene from hib  <dig> over the course of a representative experiment. transcripts of tbp <dig> and hxuc displayed similar profiles . figure 3b shows the rapid reduction in transcripts for the three genes, post fehm supplementation, for strain  <dig> cultures. transcripts for these three genes in the isolate nthi r <dig> showed a similar profile .

a necessary control experiment provided assurance that the various conditions of fehm supplementation employed in the previous experiment altered transcription levels in a gene- and effector-specific manner. the ompp <dig> gene was chosen for this analysis because it was known to be constitutively transcribed and thus not expected to be regulated by fehm. consistent with these expectations, ompp <dig> transcript levels did not differ in cells grown under the same fehm conditions described in figure  <dig> . viable counts showed that cultures grown under these conditions also did not differ .

taken together, the results described above establish that the profiles of growth, transcriptional regulation by fehm, kinetics of repression and derepression of marker genes known to be fehm repressible, and specificity of the fehm effect on transcript levels in the two clinical isolates are highly similar to those previously reported for strain rd kw <dig>  <cit> . these findings permit the use of the same experimental conditions for microarray analysis of the fehm modulon of strains hib  <dig> and nthi r <dig> that we had successfully used in our genome wide transcriptional analysis of strain rd kw <dig> 

microarray analysis of the fehm modulons of h. influenzae  <dig> and r2866
the culture and fehm supplementation regimen used to obtain paired specimens for microarray analysis was based on the preceding findings. triplicate cultures of each clinical isolate were prepared and sampled in the following way. three flasks containing  <dig> ml fehm-restricted media were inoculated per isolate. following a  <dig> minute incubation under derepressing conditions, a  <dig> ml sample was removed from each for rna purification. immediately following removal of this sample, each flask was supplemented with fehm  to establish repressing conditions. after a further  <dig> minute incubation period under repressing conditions, a second  <dig> ml sample was removed for rna purification.

this experimental design based upon the empirically established kinetics of repression of three fehm-repressible genes, allowed us to use a short validated repression time window of  <dig> minutes to compare the fully derepressed and repressed states. this short time window over which samples comparing the two conditions were obtained was expected to minimize non-specific/secondary effects of differences in fehm availability.

approximately 50– <dig> μg total rna was purified from each experimental sample. the rna samples were analyzed for quality by gel electrophoresis; for all samples, distinct bands were observed . the absence of contaminating dna was confirmed by pcr using oligonucleotide primers targeting the 16s rrna and hita genes . samples were submitted to nimblegen inc., where they underwent in-house quality control prior to being processed for microarray hybridizations. following hybridization, analysis of the resulting data showed that of the  <dig> orfs on the array corresponding to r <dig> genes,  <dig>  were differentially transcribed in a statistically significant manner . of these  <dig> genes,  <dig>  were preferentially transcribed in fehm-restricted conditions and  <dig>  were maximally transcribed in fehm-replete conditions. of the  <dig> orfs represented on the array that correspond to hib  <dig> genes,  <dig>  were significantly differentially transcribed. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig>  were maximally transcribed in fehm-restricted conditions and  <dig>  in fehm-replete conditions . in both sets of microarray data, transcripts of the fehm repressible genes tbp <dig>  hita and hxuc were elevated under fehm restriction while the constitutive ompp <dig> gene transcripts showed no significant changes for either isolate, as expected from the preliminary q-pcr experiments.  or fehm positive  respectively). comparison of the microarray data from hib  <dig> and nthi r <dig> with that derived from rd kw <dig> shows that  <dig> genes are differentially expressed in fehm-replete conditions and a separate  <dig> genes are differentially expressed in fehm-deplete conditions in all  <dig> isolates .

validation of the microarray data
several genes were selected for analysis by q-pcr for validation of the microarray data. these q-pcr analyses were performed on the same rna samples used for the microarray analysis. primers used for these analyses are shown in additional file 4: primers used for q-pcr analysis. genes analyzed included examples of those that were: 1) preferentially expressed under fehm limitation in both isolates, 2) preferentially expressed under fehm supplementation in both isolates and 3) those genes that did not exhibit significant fold changes in either isolate. genes analyzed that were preferentially expressed under fehm limitation  were: hi <dig> which encodes formate acetyltransferase, hi <dig> encoding ornithine decarboxylase, hi0997m encoding a putative outer membrane protein, hi <dig> which encodes a probable dps ferritin, hi <dig> encoding a putative abc transporter, the transferrin binding protein gene tbp <dig>  and the heme-hemopexin utilization gene hxuc . genes selected for validation that were preferentially expressed under fehm supplementation  were: hi <dig> which encodes a putative formate dehydrogenase, hi <dig> encoding alcohol dehydrogenase, hi <dig> encoding the dna architectural protein fis, hi <dig> encoding the ferritin subunit a <dig> and hi <dig> which encodes the osmoprotection-related protein bett. genes selected for validation which failed to show significant fold change when analyzed by microarray were: hi <dig> which encodes rbsg  and hi <dig> pqql, encoding a putative protease.

comparison of this q-pcr data with the array data  shows 100% agreement between regulatory status based on the fold differences observed from the array and from the q-pcr in both isolates, thus validating the array data.

confirmation of the core fehm modulon
examination of the microarray data for hib  <dig> and nthi r <dig> and the comparison with the published rd kw <dig> data  show that each gene falls into one of three distinct sets: 1) those differentially regulated in a statistically significant manner in all isolates; 2) those variably regulated across isolates; 3) those not regulated . the former set of genes comprise the putative core fehm modulon while the second may be isolate specific responses to fehm status or results of experimental variation. to confirm that the profiles we have observed are reproducible we performed an independent experiment that repeated the transcription-repression protocol detailed above, but performed q-pcr analysis on the samples  using select primer sets targeting representative genes . since our focus is elucidation of genes preferentially transcribed under fehm restriction, we primarily selected targets from the fehm-ve genes. each isolate was grown as described for the microarray experiments  and samples taken at  <dig> and  <dig> minutes . following q-pcr, genes with a fold change ≥  <dig>  were considered as differentially regulated between the two growth conditions. fifty two targets were selected from the genes comprising the putative core modulon . these were selected to target the monocistronic genes and at least one gene in the majority of operons. each target was examined in each isolate. of the  <dig> q-pcr results, approximately 94%  matched that of the microarray in terms of regulatory status. the actual data values for each pcr, compared to that of the microarray experiment are shown in table  <dig>  these data show that the regulation of the core fehm modulon is reproducible in each of the three isolates. in addition, these data provide strong evidence for conservation of the core fehm modulon across the species and in other fehm-restricted environments such as the human host.

with regard to genes showing potential different regulatory profiles between isolates,  <dig> genes were selected comprising  <dig> that were fehm-ve in at least one of the isolates and  <dig> that were fehm+ve in at least one isolate. of these, a significant portion had data values determined to be below our threshold of significance by microarray. q-pcr was performed on all isolates to either confirm the known microarray value or determine the value . for genes with a significant value 69%  of the q-pcrs resulted in agreement of regulatory status . of the non-significant values  62%  were returned by q-pcr to be below  <dig>  fold difference. thirteen of the  <dig> q-pcrs that showed a > <dig>  fold difference  resulted in that gene displaying a regulated profile in all three isolates. interestingly, several of these genes are internal to an operon for which the other genes were already deemed part of the fehm core modulon. for example, the genes hi0098-hi <dig>  were shown by microarray to be regulated in  <dig> and rd kw <dig> but not r <dig>  although the first gene in the operon hi <dig>  was regulated in all three strains. q-pcr analysis confirmed regulation of these genes in all  <dig> isolates.

operonic concordance
additional file  <dig> shows the correlation of responsive loci in the two strains analyzed in this study and in the previously reported analysis of strain rd kw <dig>  from this table it is clear that genes exhibiting different regulation between the isolates are coregulated with the rest of that operon within the isolate . the fact that there is operonic concordance in each sample set attests to the utility of the novel multi-genome chip we designed for these studies.

the core fehm modulon contains  <dig> genes preferentially expressed under fehm limitation
as expected, the core fehm-ve genes identified by microarray include many genes known to be associated with fehm acquisition. these included hita, tonb, exbd, exbb, hgpb, hgpc and the hxu and tbp operons. in addition to genes clearly or potentially associated with fehm acquisition we identified several other loci with roles potentially related to fehm metabolism such as protection against oxidative stress, fehm storage and detoxification and biofilm formation.

one such gene, hi <dig>  has similarities to dps ferritins  which non specifically bind dna to protect from damage by reactive oxygen species  <cit> . the dps ferritins in other bacteria are induced by nutritional starvation, including metal ion starvation  <cit> . recently the expression of the h. influenzae dps ferritin has been shown to be under the control of both the arcab two-component regulatory system  <cit>  and oxyr  <cit> . the arcab regulatory system controls metabolic flux during anaerobic growth and also appears to control genes in a pre-emptive protection against a burst of reactive oxygen intermediates  when aerobic growth resumes  <cit> . mutation of arca decreases the expression of the dps ferritin. furthermore, the dps ferritin was shown to mediate resistance to peroxide  <cit> . the oxyr regulon is the coordinated response to oxidative damage induced by treatment with peroxide  <cit> . the increased expression of the dps ferritins under fehm limitation may similarly protect against roi should exogenous fehm be added to the culture media.

the hi0590- <dig> operon, encoding putrescine-ornithine antiporter and ornithine decarboxylase , is also similarly regulated in all isolates. this locus is potentially important in virulence since polyamines play a major role in the regulation of numerous cellular processes by modulating the biosynthesis of dna, rna and proteins  <cit> . in yersinia pestis, polyamines play an essential role in biofilm formation  <cit> , and in e. coli they have been implicated in defense against peroxide  <cit> . polyamines have also been implicated as an alternative source of energy production via generation of a transmembrane proton motive force  <cit> . recently, this locus has been shown to be regulated by arca in h. influenzae  <cit> .

other fehm-ve genes include those encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  fumerase c  and malate dehydrogenase . together with the product of hi <dig> encoding aspartate ammonia lyase  and asparaginase b , these enzymes would lead to the sequential conversion of l-asparagine to l-aspartate, fumarate, malate, oxaloacetate and finally, with the action of pcka, yield phosphoenolpyruvate which then feeds into gluconeogenesis to generate a pool of glucose phosphate. it is interesting that the nthi r <dig> genome lacks hi <dig>  and thus would not create the substrate of aspa , a gene which it may not up-regulate.

our previous study to determine the fehm modulon of rd kw <dig> elucidated several fehm-ve genes with a potential involvement in fehm acquisition  <cit> . included in these genes were two that encoded putative tonb-dependent outer membrane proteins . this study confirms the increased transcription of these genes in two further isolates while under fehm limitation. the role of these loci is currently unknown; however, the sequence homologies and similarities in the predicted secondary structure to other known tonb-dependent proteins suggest a role in iron and/or heme acquisition. both hi <dig> and hi <dig> are foci of ongoing research with respect to their potential roles in fehm acquisition.

the core fehm modulon contains  <dig> genes preferentially expressed under fehm supplementation
included in the subset of fehm+ve genes are several genes with a clear role in fehm homeostasis and resistance to reactive radicals as well as genes for which the encoded protein requires iron or heme for functionality. the genes hi <dig> and hi <dig> encode the ferritin subunits which form a macromolecular structure that stores and detoxifies fe when cellular levels become elevated. also in the fehm+ve group are genes hi0006m-hi <dig> comprising the formate dehydrogenase complex which is an fe-s cluster containing system, and the genes in the operon hi0172-hi <dig> which encode an fe-s assembly complex. interestingly, the formate dehydrogenase locus  is also part of the arcab regulon and shows decreased transcription in the arca mutant  <cit> . the genes hi1066-hi <dig> encode subunits of nitrite reductase, which may assist in defense against reactive nitrogen species.

not all genes involved in fehm acquisition are contained in the core fehm modulon
a locus identified in the current study, yet missed in the rd kw <dig> microarray, is that of gene hi0997m. in nthi r <dig> and hib  <dig> it is the 5th and 2nd most upregulated gene respectively. regulation of this gene was not observed in the rd kw <dig> array study since it was excluded from the chip design. this exclusion was due to the presence of a stop codon within the reading frame of this gene in the original published rd kw <dig> genomic sequence   <cit> . the exclusion of this and other such sequences on the rd kw <dig> chip is one of the driving forces behind the development of new microarrays targeting all genes and pseudogenes of the isolates being studied. the product of hi0997m exhibits homology to a putative outer membrane protein, ompu, of neisseria meningitides. this protein has been implicated in heme utilization since it facilitates the uptake of exogenous heme in esherichia coli . we used q-pcr, to examine the fehm regulated transcription of the region immediately upstream of the internal stop codon in hi0997m of strain rd kw <dig> using cdna derived from the samples detailed in our previous rd kw <dig> microarray study  <cit> . transcription of this region of hi0997m in rd kw <dig> under fehm limitation was  <dig>  fold higher than observed in fehm-replete media. thus, hi0997m exhibits a similar pattern of transcriptional change in response to fehm limitation in all three strains and may thus warrant inclusion as a core fehm-ve gene. however, nucleotide sequencing of three independent pcrs of hi0997m from strain rd kw <dig> confirmed the presence of the internal stop codon, and thus hi0997m in rd kw <dig> may not encode a functional protein .

an additional locus that was identified in our previous study, and confirmed in this report, is that of the  <dig> gene operon hi0359-hi <dig>  this locus has homology to the yfeabcd locus of yersinia pestis which plays a role in the uptake fe, mn and zn  <cit> . from the microarray data, all genes in this locus are clearly upregulated in both rd kw <dig> and r <dig> yet appear to be unregulated in hib strain  <dig>  to confirm this, q-pcr was performed in the first and second genes hi <dig> and hi <dig> respectively . the results show that the first gene of the operon is upregulated in each isolate, while the second gene in hib  <dig> is not, confirming the differential regulation observed by microarray.

the three gene operon comprising hi0126-hi <dig> is fehm-ve in rd kw <dig> and r <dig> but absent from the genome of hib  <dig>  these three genes have homology to the iron repressible afu locus of a. pleuropneumoniae  <cit>  as well as the sfuabc proteins of serratia marcescens  <cit>  and the yfuabc proteins of y. pestis  <cit> . this system constitutes a periplasmic binding protein-dependent iron transport system in these organisms. the three genes encode the periplasmic iron-binding protein , a highly hydrophobic integral cytoplasmic membrane protein with two consensus permease motifs  and a hydrophilic peripheral cytoplasmic membrane protein with atp-binding motifs , respectively. also included in genes lacking an intact homologue in the other two isolates is the strain  <dig> locus designated hib <dig> . this fehm-repressible gene encodes a heme internalization protein designated hipa  <cit> . the other strains examined have various genomic deletions at the site of this gene. in rd kw <dig> the homologous cds to hipa is hi1268m. comparison of rd kw <dig> with the hib  <dig> hip locus indicates that rd kw <dig> lacks the region spanning the middle of the upstream, divergently transcribed, hi <dig>  gene to the middle of the hipa sequence, including the intergenic region, effectively leaving both fragments of hi <dig> and hipa without promotors. the downstream genes in rd kw <dig>  hipbcd, are partially intact, but show no regulation by fehm levels, possibly due to the lack of any promoter elements. conversely, the isolate nthi r <dig> has a deletion spanning hipabc, leaving the gene hi <dig> intact. even though the upstream region of the hipa gene remains, there is no apparent regulation of the hi <dig> gene. comparison of the deletions at this locus in the three strains is depicted in figure  <dig> 

the genes identified here with potential roles in heme and iron acquisition are each the subject of ongoing studies in this laboratory as we seek to further define the range and role of fehm acquisition systems in h. influenzae.

fehm levels may modulate transcription of several genes previously defined as members of the arca regulon
the data discussed above details a number of genes that are also regulated as part of the arca regulon  <cit>  . the presence of several fehm regulated genes discussed above in the arca regulon led us to compare the other genes of the arca regulon and those of the fehm modulon reported here. table  <dig> shows the genes reported to comprise the arca regulon and the fehm induced modulation of those genes in nthi r <dig>  hib  <dig> and rd kw <dig>  all three actual genes with decreased expression in a Δarca mutant are also upregulated during fehm limitation, in the isolates we have examined . similarly, comparison of the set of genes determined to have increased expression in the Δarca strain with the fehm regulation data indicates that of the  <dig> genes upregulated in Δarca,  <dig> show upregulation during fehm supplementation in at least one of the isolates studied. the data in table  <dig> indicates that hib  <dig> and nthi r <dig> show greater similarity with the arca regulon than does strain rd kw <dig>  this may result from the experimental conditions used in the microarrays or may reflect a true difference in the regulation. since the arc regulator responds to changes in redox potential perceived as oxidation and/or reduction of membrane bound quinones  <cit> , as opposed to oxygen levels per se, it is possible that the addition of an excess of exogenous iron may lead to trans-membrane redox alteration via a localized fenton reaction analagous to that proposed by liu et al  <cit>  resulting in changes in transcription of genes in the arca regulon. previously it has been shown that Δarca mutants of h. influenzae show decreased lethality in a mouse model as well as increased sensitivity to killing by human serum  <cit> . however, the potential variable regulation observed between the isolates in this study is a clear indication that multiple isolates need to be examined before drawing firm conclusions regarding the extent of a regulon or modulon in an organism, and the role of that modulon in virulence.

CONCLUSIONS
the current investigation was performed to identify the genes preferentially transcribed under fehm limitation in two clinically relevant isolates of h. influenzae and, by comparison with previously published observations, to begin to define the core fehm modulon for this species. since our focus at the outset was the elucidation of potential targets mediating iron and/or heme uptake, our experimental conditions were optimized by q-pcr analysis of known fehm repressible genes. by inference, these conditions were expected to identify other genes with similar transcriptional kinetics.

this study identified a putative core set of  <dig> fehm-ve genes that are similarly regulated in three unrelated h. influenzae isolates. this core contains the majority of the known fehm uptake genes, including the hgps, the hxucba operon, and the tbp operon. all of these are tonb-dependent receptor complexes and the tonb operon was also determined to be fehm-ve in all isolates examined.

using the criteria of genes determined to be fehm-ve with similarity to known tonb-dependent proteins two other genes were identified with a potential role in fehm uptake; hi <dig> and hi <dig>  both of these genes are subjects of ongoing studies in our laboratory

during the design of the experiments detailed in this manuscript, as well as those previously reported from strain rd kw <dig>  <cit> , great care was taken to ensure that each isolate was treated identically to minimize environmental influences other than the fehm status of the media. nevertheless, there remain potential strain-specific transcriptional differences observed among the three isolates by microarray. while every effort was taken to ensure that the observed effects result solely from the transition of the culture from fehm restricted to fehm supplemented conditions, other environmental stimuli cannot be entirely ruled out. it is possible that in our microarray experiments the removal of a large sample from the culture might perturb oxygen levels in the remaining medium. however, identical control experiments in which smaller samples were removed for q-pcr analysis  showed similar regulatory profiles of 94% of the core fehm genes predicted by microarray. this finding indicates that oxygenation effects due to removal of a large sample volume in the microarray experiments are unlikely to account for the apparent effects of fehm addition on gene regulation. a second potential environmental condition that could lead to transcriptional changes distinct from the response to fehm addition is an alteration in the levels of other nutrients between the two time points. the two samples used in the microarray are separated by only a  <dig> minute period and are drawn from the same culture. this removes any potential flask-to-flask differences. in addition, due to the fehm restriction, the cultures are growing slowly and are at a relatively low cell density and thus unlikely to be significantly depleting available nutrients during the time period between sampling. a further source of experimentally induced variation may be the temporal separation between individual microarray experiments. to overcome this, the control q-pcr experiments were performed at the same time, with the same batch of media, under identical conditions. taken together, these considerations suggest that nutrient depletion is unlikely to play a significant role in the observed outcomes of gene expression analyses. while we propose that the  <dig> minute period between sampling is too short to observe nutrient related changes in gene transcription in the culture, we have not performed experiments to specifically address this issue and are unable to completely discount this possibility.

additional file  <dig> only contains genes for which a fold change > <dig>  was determined by microarray in at least one isolate. however, the level of expression of the "unregulated", constitutively expressed fehm genes  is unclear. are these genes expressed at a low constitutive level or at a level more like upregulated genes? in addition, the independent q-pcr analysis also emphasize the fact that the reporting of "ns" in additional file  <dig> for fold change of a gene is not an indication that that gene is not regulated. thus, further studies are required to define the actual regulatory status of "ns" genes before the gene may be excluded as part of the core fehm modulon. these missing pieces of information would have a profound effect on our understanding of the system biology of fehm uptake and utilization as well as cellular metabolism.

comparisons of the fehm responsive genes in the three isolates indicate that nthi r <dig> and hib <dig> are more similar to each other than they are to rd kw <dig>  this may arise from the fact that the two isolates examined in this study are both recently isolated clinical isolates as opposed to rd kw <dig> which has undergone multiple passages on artificial media or it may merely reflect the fact that rd kw <dig> has a different mode of regulation than the other isolates. to investigate this aspect further, additional microarray analyses are planned with other genome-sequenced h. influenzae isolates.

in constrast with other model organisms, relatively few studies have been published in h. influenzae that have examined global transcriptional regulatory networks. comparative genomic analyses have identified putative members of the fnr and crp regulons  <cit>  and purine, arginine and aromatic amino acid regulons  <cit> . knockouts have identified genes whose transcriptional profiles differ upon disruption of a possible regulatory element or co-effector. included in these studies are the results of disruption of the tfox  gene involved in regulating competence genes and the cya gene responsible for production of camp  <cit> . this latter effect would alter regulation patterns of genes within the crp regulon. other studies have examined effects of disruption of the arca and oxyr regulators  <cit> . furthermore, transcriptional effects resulting from specific environmental changes have been examined independently  <cit>  or can be derived from the above studies. thus, we can determine transcription patterns affected by transition between fehm availability  <cit> , sugar and nucleotide availability  <cit> , and presence of oxidizing agents  <cit> .

as could be expected, the results of our examination of transcriptional patterns altered by fehm availability possess degrees of overlap with the results from these previous studies. for example, fehm restriction can be predicted to result in a profound impact on energy generation in the cell. in fact, many genes previously demonstrated to be upregulated during nutrient limitation in a camp-dependent manner are also downregulated in this study upon the addition of fehm. this suggests that the fehm depleted cultures had elevated camp levels. yet some genes demonstrate the opposite effect. these data show that gene regulatory networks in h. influenzae exhibit complexity beyond mere concurrent activation of independent regulons. for example, the dps gene , encoding the dps ferritin protein, appears to be part of the arca and oxyr regulons as well as responsive to fehm levels. transcripts from the operon comprising the ornithine decarboxylase and putrescine transporter  and the hi <dig> gene encoding a probable transport permease are negatively impacted by disruption of the arca and cya genes compared to the wildtype strain and are also downregulated in response to fehm addition; yet transcripts the gene encoding lactate permease  which decrease in the cya mutant, increase in the arca mutant and are upregulated in response to fehm addition. studies examining targets of particular transcriptional regulators should be performed in parallel with studies examining the effect of a particular stimulating substance as part of a global approach to define gene regulation. however, the lack of sufficient data from h. influenzae makes a thorough examination of iron or heme's affect on independent regulons difficult within the scope of this work.

overall, the data reveal a core fehm modulon shared by all of the isolates studied. the core modulon includes genes in known regulons shown to have a role in virulence, such as the arca regulon  <cit> . it is clear that the physiological roles of the genes in the putative core fehm modulon are broad in the scope of function and may encompass most cellular processes including replication, energy metabolism, solute transport, protection against oxidation and biofilm formation. in addition, several new, previously uncharacterized genes have been identified with a possible role in fehm metabolism. on the basis of our data it would appear that each of the three isolates may have a distinct set of non-core genes that respond to fehm availability. many of these genes are specific to individual isolates . while a common mechanism for coordinated regulation of the core modulon across the species can be postulated, the regulation of the species-specific genes and strain-specific genes pose separate questions.

in summary, the major conclusions of this study are the following. first, the culture, microarray, and q-pcr methodologies that we previously employed for the analysis of the regulation of gene expression by fehm in the h. influenzae laboratory strain rd kw <dig> were successfully extended to two recently sequenced clinical isolates, strains  <dig> and r <dig>  second, characterization of growth in vitro and conditions for reproducible transcriptional regulation by fehm permitted direct comparison of gene expression among these three strains under identical environmental conditions. third, among these three h. influenzae strains, a core set of genes responsive to environmental fehm levels had been defined. the rigor and reproducibility of these microarray data were confirmed independently by q-pcr. fourth, these studies demonstrate the utility of comparative transcriptional profiling to identify genes shared across the species that are core members of an important modulon. these genes may play a key role in virulence; they are likely expressed during human disease; and thus, may comprise useful targets for potential therapeutic studies. these studies lay the foundation for further investigation of the role played by the fehm modulon in h. influenzae virulence.
