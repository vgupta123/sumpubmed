BACKGROUND
mineral nutrients are one of the most basic components of plant tissue culture media. unlike carbon sources, plant growth regulators, vitamins, amino acids, gelling agents and undefined substances that may or may not be included in any given medium, the mineral nutrients are always present  <cit> . thus, a great deal of time and effort has been devoted to identifying the optimal concentrations for each of the currently established  <dig> essential plant nutrients  <cit> . nitrogen in the form of nh4+ and no3- is the dominant mineral nutrient in most tissue culture formulations including ms  <cit>  the most widely used nutrient formulation in plant tissue culture. nitrogen effects are highly dependent on both the total amount of nitrogen and on the proportion of nh4+ and no3- and affect a wide range of in vitro responses including callus growth, shoot and root organogenesis, embryogenesis, and shoot multiplication  <cit> . we thus chose to determine the effects of nitrogen nutrition on the growth of nonembryogenic and embryogenic cell lines of sweet orange  osbeck).

nonembryogenic tissue has been used for biochemical characterization of pathogenesis-related  proteins  <cit>  and as a source of protoplasts for somatic hybridization  <cit> . embryogenic tissue is often used for enzymatic studies  <cit>  is the primary source of protoplasts for somatic hybridization  <cit>  and is also used for genetic transformation  <cit> .

a primary consideration in quantifying the effects of specific mineral nutrients is the concept of ion confounding as previously discussed in  <cit>  and  <cit> . ion confounding occurs when salts are treated as experimental factors in experimental designs focused on determining the effects of nutrients/ions in solution. to illustrate this concept, consider a simple experiment wherein a single salt such as kno <dig> is varied over some concentration range and a particular in vitro response is measured. any measured change in the response may be due to k+, no3-, and/or the interaction between k+ and no3-. when salts are used as factors both ions are simultaneously varied; consequently, their effects are potentially confounded with each other  <cit> . no valid conclusions can be derived regarding the main effects of the two component ions k+ or no3- or their interaction from such an experiment. the measured effect in a salt-based experiment is actually the mean effect of the two ions, k+ and no3-, in a 1: <dig> proportion at varying concentrations. the so-called "co-ion approach" often employed to circumvent this limitation is not valid  <cit> . in short, ion confounding occurs when the ion of interest are covaried with the complementary ion associated with the salts used; that is, attempting to vary the concentration of a single cation or anion using a salt results in a simultaneous change in the associated co-ion. such changes also include ions added via ph adjustments but unaccounted for in the experimental design. we report the results from an approach that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first study on the effects of nitrogen nutrition obtained with experimentation free of ion confounding.

dry weight accumulation  required a log base  <dig> transformation as per a box-cox power transform plot analysis. model diagnostics were within acceptable limits and the lack-of-fit test was significant  indicating that 1) additional variation in the residuals might be accounted for with a better model or, 2) an unusually low level of pure error was present. the three r <dig> statistics ranged from  <dig>  –  <dig> . the overall model was highly significant  indicating significant factor effects on dry weight accumulation by these three ions. the anova revealed four significant terms, three of which, the linear mixture, nh <dig> * k, and nh <dig> * , had p-values <  <dig>  .

analysis
the effects of these three ions on nonembryogenic and embryogenic tissue growth were similar in several ways. first, the linear mixture component was highly significant for both tissue types. the linear mixture component compares the responses at the extreme ends  of the mixture design space. this means that growth at the points comprising the  <dig> nh4+: <dig> k+ ratio were compared to growth at the points comprising the  <dig>  nh4+: <dig>  k+ ratio. likewise, the regression coefficients for nh4+ and k+ in tables  <dig> and  <dig> are estimates of growth at the vertices only, not estimates of the effects of these components. it is clear when viewing figure  <dig> that growth along the  <dig> nh4+: <dig> k+ y-axis is considerably less than growth along the  <dig>  nh4+: <dig>  k+ y-axis; this is reflected in the larger regression coefficient for nh4+ vs. k+ in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  good growth of citrus nonembryogenic and embryogenic tissue requires that > <dig>  which is consistent with many other tissue culture systems  <cit> .

second, the nh4+ *k+ term was highly significant for both tissue types , which reveals that nh4+ and k+ exhibit strong synergistic blending. this means that growth was substantially greater at certain blends of these two ions vs. the growth that was observed at the extreme ends or vertices of the mixture. for the two cell lines, ratios from  <dig>  nh4+: <dig>  k+ to  <dig>  nh4+: <dig>  k+ resulted in the greatest increase in fresh weight . these ranges correspond to a nh4+:no3- ratio of 1: <dig> at  <dig>  mm total n at the centerpoints  – note that in standard ms medium this ratio is 1: <dig> at  <dig> mm total n . it should be noted that the nh4+:no3- ratio effect is only correlative and cannot be directly quantified from our experimental design.

third, the effect of the nh4+:k+ mixture and no3- amount on dry weight accumulation was comparable to fresh weight accumulation of nonembryogenic callus. specifically, the nh4+:k+ mixture was the primary driver of dry weight accumulation. one difference was that no3- amount had less of an effect on dry weight than it did for fresh weight accumulation. this result possibly suggests that the nh4+:k+ mixture promotes cell division and no3- amount promotes cell expansion. resolution of this effect cannot be done with the experimental design used in this study. to do this would require that all proportion effects be accounted for in an nh4+:k+:no3- mixture-amount design, which would capture the two currently "hidden" two- and three-component effects, namely, k+:no3-, nh4+:no3-, and nh4+:k+:no3-. for embryogenic callus the results were somewhat different; there was a relatively strong nh4+ * no3- amount effect on dry weight not observed for fresh weight .

interestingly, the interaction between the nh4+:k+ mixture and no3- amount for fresh weight growth as revealed in the nh4+ * k+ *  and nh4+ * k+ *  <dig> terms was significant for the nonembryogenic tissue, but not significant for the embryogenic callus. this probably reflects the greater effect of these factors on nonembryogenic tissue where the point of greatest growth was a 198% increase in fresh weight vs. a 67% increase for embryogenic tissue. it should be pointed out that the magnitude of the effects of the interaction between nh4+:k+ mixture and no3- amount on fresh weight accumulation for both tissue types was substantially less than the main effects of the nh4+:k+mixture – evident when the p-values are compared.

discussion
the effects of nh4+, k+, and no3- on the growth of nonembryogenic and embryogenic citrus callus were determined using an approach that removed ion confounding from the experimental design. the basic approach was to 1) design an experiment where the ions nh4+, k+, and no3-, as opposed to their salts  <cit> , were the factors to be varied  <cit> ; 2) fix all other inorganic ions at their ms levels; 3) calculate the salt/acid/base formulations required to achieve the ion levels specified for each treatment combination using the ion/salt linear programming algorithm and the software ars-media  <cit>  to remove ion confounding. because mineral nutrients are known to include both proportional and amount effects, proportionality and amount were incorporated into the design of the experiment. because the three ions are all monovalent, treating nh4+ and k+ as a 2-component mixture matched to the amount of no3- resulted in a design space of near uniform ph. the effects of total nitrogen and the ratio of nh4+ to no3- were indirectly captured in the selected design. it is important to point out that this approach did not directly control ph, i.e. treat ph as an independent variable. all the bulk solution properties of the initial media solutions such as ph and ion speciation were inherent to the selected design space. because the bulk solution properties were treated as dependent variables, the experiment was free of ion confounding and allowed estimation of ion-specific effects on tissue growth. however, it is important to note that by 'constraining' ph in this manner we were unable to directly quantify the effects of the nh4+:no3- ratios, i.e. we can only perform correlative analyses to explore these effects.

we assumed when designing the experiment for this study that most of the k+ ions would primarily affect bulk solution properties  such as the electrical charge of the system. the experimental design space explored in this study is actually a subset of points that describe a plane through a less-constrained 3-dimensional experimental design space defined by the axes nh4+:k+, nh4+:k+ amount, and no3- amount . all of the points falling on this plane have a ph near  <dig>  – ph increases above the plane and decreases below it. this raises the question of the importance of the starting ph of the culture medium. given that tissue growth was not uniform across the experimental design space, tissue growth did not correlate well with initial solution ph. the nonuniform growth across a common ph plane is analogous to the surprisingly low correlation between solution ph and protein precipitation observed in experiments free of ion confounding designed to detect ion-specific effects  <cit> . for the responses measured in this study, the primary drivers are the ions under independent control  and is an empirical demonstration that ph is a dependent variable and must be treated as such experimentally. the ph, or 'relative proton activity', of a given solution is primarily determined by the type and concentration of the ions in solution. thus, ph can only be examined in a correlational relationship and cannot be established as a causal factor. one implication of these results is that an experimental design to grow plant tissues on mineral nutrient combinations free of ion confounding greatly expands the experimental design space by removing the "ph bias" . are there regions in the experimental design space described in figure  <dig> where citrus tissue would grow as well or better than on the plane sampled in these experiments? given that each of the responses displayed a 'hot-spot' near the center of the experimental design space, there is no reason to assume that there may not be even better regions for growth that lie above or below this plane. certainly, by sampling the full cubic design space depicted in figure  <dig>  regions outside of ph  <dig>  where citrus tissue grows well might be identified. thus, the selection of the "ph  <dig> " plane was, to some extent arbitrary, and was chosen because it was the ph value used by murashige and skoog  <cit> . the value of the experiments conducted by murashige and skoog was that most of the components required for culturing a wide range of plant species in vitro were identified, and a formulation was developed that works in some fashion for a large variety of plant species. ms has been very useful as a starting point for species-specific media formulation optimization studies. the fact that the best media formulation for citrus tissue growth differs from ms is not surprising given that ms medium was developed for tobacco pith callus as opposed to citrus callus. however, because ms was developed using salt-based, ph-adjusted, one-factor-at-a-time  experiments, we really have no reason to assume that ms is optimal even for tobacco pith callus. the research presented here is a logical extension of murashige and skoog's seminal work, and represents the next step in the evolution of plant tissue culture media development.

CONCLUSIONS
a substantial increase in tissue growth was observed in sweet orange nonembryogenic and embryogenic tissue in certain regions of a 2-dimensional design space defined by 2-component nh4+:k+ mixture and no3- amount axes. such an approach removes ion confounding, treats all initial bulk solution properties as dependent variables, and separates proportional and amount effects. the result is an experimental design space defined by ion factors/components suited for systematic exploration. some of the implications of this approach include 1) the practical aspects of developing improved media formulations; 2) the more basic aspects of quantifying ion-specific responses in an experimentally rigorous manner and relating these responses changes to gene/protein/metabolite profiles and phenotype and; 3) the concept that specific media formulations are more properly viewed as "ion-coordinates" in a hyperdimensional geometry defined by all of the components that constitute a medium rather than as the salt recipe that is used to create that medium.
