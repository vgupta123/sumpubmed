BACKGROUND
since the identification of the first micrornas  as key regulatory molecules in the pathway controlling the timing of larval development in caenorhabditis elegans
 <cit> , great progress has been made in the understanding of mirna function in various species. ha and kim reported the biogenesis of mirna in animals and pointed out that dis-regulation of mirnas is associated with many human diseases
 <cit> . in plants, the molecular events underlying mirna biogenesis and degradation, and mirna-mediated gene silencing were also reported
 <cit> , such as, mirnas are involved in plant development, signaling, abiotic stresses and symbiotic relationship regulation
 <cit> . intensive studies indicate that mirnas are involved in post-transcriptional regulation and appear to be one of the most significant regulatory mechanisms
 <cit> . currently, more than  <dig>  mature mirnas have been identified from  <dig> species including vertebrates, flies, worms, plants and viruses . high evolutionary conservation among different plant species provides the premise for mirna identification. in plants, mirnas are single strand, usually 21–22 nt long small rna molecules that are processed by dicer-like  <dig>  mirna/mirna* duplexes, which contain the mature mirna, are processed from pre-mirna which is produced from primary mirna
 <cit> . one of the strands of the generated mirna/mirna* duplex is incorporated into the rna-induced silencing complex . this strand is usually the mature mirna strand and the mirna* strand gets degraded
 <cit> . by cleavage of target mrnas
 <cit> , translational repression
 <cit>  or transcriptional inhibition
 <cit> , mature mirnas suppress the expression of their target genes. some plant mirnas physically clustered together as a polycistron, suggesting that these mirnas potentially regulate gene expression coordinately
 <cit> .

a number of studies have suggested that mirnas play an important role in regulating development of plants, the response to environment and many other biochemical reactions
. for example, gao et al.
 <cit>  reported that mir319/mir319a/mir319e may contribute to an increase in imperfect flower ratios in the pistil of japanese apricot development. mir <dig> functions in regulating the transition between developmental stages and in specifying floral organ identity by regulating expression of ap2-domain-containing transcription factors in monocots and dicots
 <cit> . karlova et al.
 <cit>  reported that cnr and siap2a, known as the auxin response factor  and ripening regulators, were actively modulated by mir156/ <dig> and mir <dig> during tomato ripening. moxon et al.
 <cit>  validated that a member of the constitutive triple response  family is involved in tomato fruit ripening, which is the target of the novel mirna, and a higher expression pattern of mir <dig> was found in small fruit than in leaves and flowers. over expressing an atmir156b precursor generated abnormal flower and fruit morphology in tomato by targeting s.lycopersicum sbp genes
 <cit> . itaya et al.
 <cit>  reported that mir <dig> is involved in auxin response and apetala <dig>  was the target gene of mir <dig>  in strawberry
 <cit> , two members of mir <dig>  were identified interacting with fa-gamyb during the course of berry receptacle development and cooperatively changed ga endogenous levels. in sweet orange, csi-mir <dig> showed a high expression level in fruit ripening and targeted the nac transcription factor
 <cit> .

pear  with more than  <dig>  years of cultivation history is regarded as one of the most important fruit crops and cultivated worldwide in  <dig> countries. rich in vitamin c, dietary fiber, sugar, protein, and many other nutrients, pear fruit has consistently been consumed fresh, canned, and dried and is believed to benefit human health. small rnas have been annotated for pear genome in our previous research study
 <cit> , and the genome wide identification of pear mirnas was recently reported recently
 <cit> . however, the function of mirnas in pear fruit development remains unknown and specific mirnas for fruit are expected to be identified. in this study, we investigated the mirna profiles of pear fruits from different developmental stages with illumina hiseq  <dig> platform, combined with bioinformatics analysis and experimental verification, and it is the first to prove that mirnas are widely involved in the regulation of pear fruit development and quality.

RESULTS
small rna library preparation and sequencing
total rna extracted from pear fruit samples, which were collected at different developmental stages from 15 days after flowering  to  <dig> daf, was employed to build small rna libraries for sequencing. total reads, ranging from  <dig> million to  <dig> million of the six libraries, were generated from illumina hiseq  <dig> . after removing adaptors, poly a reads and reads of less than 18 nt, clean reads varied from  <dig> million to  <dig> million, which occupied on average  <dig> % in total reads of the six libraries, were collected. approximately  <dig> %  of the clean reads could be mapped to known noncoding rnas  deposited in the ncbi. there were  <dig> , <dig> reads on average identified to be putative known mirnas, and an average of  <dig> , <dig> identified to be un-annotated mirnas . using soap <dig> software, more than  <dig> million clean reads  were perfectly mapped to the pear genome
 <cit> .table  <dig>

*rrna/snrna/snorna/trna considered.



the number of reads with different lengths of the six small rna libraries was counted . it was observed that small rnas with length ranging from 21 nt to 24 nt were most frequent  of all the clean reads of each library, with 24 nt the most abundant  small rna length, followed by 23 nt, 21 nt, and 20 nt, in that order. the result was consistent with previous reports in various species, including tomato
 <cit> , arabidopsis thaliana
 <cit> , citrus trifoliate
 <cit> , medicago truncatula
 <cit> , citrus sativus
 <cit> , and maize
 <cit>  which all suggest the most abundant small rna length is 24 nt.figure  <dig>

identification of conserved mirnas in pear fruit
in order to identify the known mirnas in pear fruit, the clean reads of each library were compared to other plant mirnas deposited in mirbase  <dig> . following the blastn searches and further sequence analysis, on average more than  <dig> million total reads for six libraries were perfectly matched to  <dig> known mirnas . among these,  <dig> mirnas were identified as  <dig> known mirna families deposited in mirbase. the numbers of mirna in one mirna family were various. as listed in additional file
 <dig>  five families, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  have two mirnas each. the rest of the  <dig> families have one mirna each, and there were  <dig> conserved mirnas with no match to any family, possibly due to the variation between different species.

the location of  <dig> conserved mirna was shown according to the pear genome data . from these,  <dig> mirnas were located on chromosomes or scaffolds, and multiple transcript sites for all  <dig> mirnas ensured the mirna gene expression and important regulation function. however, this result showed great difference with rice, in which 69% of mapped small rnas have a unique genome location
 <cit> . whether the multiple or unique transcripts of mirna have a special function is still unknown. the remaining  <dig> pear fruit mirnas did not map to chromosome sites due to incomplete genome annotation. except for the  <dig> mirnas with unknown transcript sites, mir <dig> had the most transcript sites with  <dig> .

in previous studies of pear
 <cit> ,  <dig> conserved pear mirnas and  <dig> mirna families were identified. comparatively, there were  <dig> of the same mirna families  found in our research. additionally, mir <dig> was shown to be the largest mirna family in pear. in japanese apricot
 <cit>  and peanut
 <cit> , mir <dig> was also found to be the largest mirna family of all the identified mirna families. the result may suggest the fundamental function played by mir <dig> across various species.

the analysis of read counts for known mirna families suggested the great expression frequency divergences among these mirnas. with respect to the abundance of each mirna family, the frequencies varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  reads, indicating that expression varies significantly among different mirna families. in the six libraries, mir165a showed the highest sequencing reads, which may suggest the largest expression in pear fruit among mirna families. the varied abundance is also identified in certain members from the same family. for example, the abundance of mir <dig> varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  reads in  <dig> daf library, as was the case for some other families, including mir <dig>  and mir <dig> . the two members of the mir <dig> family showed distinct sequencing reads, mir4414a with  <dig>  and mir4414a* with  <dig> in  <dig> daf library. the two members of the mir <dig> family also observed the similar phenomenon at the  <dig> daf library, mir164a showed abundance with  <dig>  and mir164c* with  <dig>  the results indicate that expression levels of different members within one mirna family varied greatly during fruit development. in addition, the multiple locations for the same mirna varieties also suggests there were many transcript sites for each mirna in the genome, so there was a choice of member to transcribe in the same mirna family, which may explain the expression variation.

identification of novel mirnas in pear fruit
mireap software was used to predict novel mirnas in fruit by exploring the secondary structure compared with whole genome data
 <cit> .  <dig>  total reads and  <dig> unique reads were identified as novel mirnas. there were  <dig> novel mirnas in total and  <dig> of them classified into  <dig> different known mirna families. precursors forming hairpin structures were obtained. the average negative minimal folding free energy  was - <dig>  kcal/mol , which was similar to the sequencing data for maize mirna precursors 
 <cit>  and arabidopsis thaliana mirna precursors 
 <cit> . the length of the novel mirna precursors was identified to range from  <dig> to 374 nt, which was quite close to japanese apricot
 <cit> . as previous reported plant mirna prefers the length 21 nt with the 5′ end base bias to uracil 
 <cit> . in our research, we also found base biases of 21 nt of novel mirna showing the similar pattern, the u nucleotide took the leading percentage , followed by a , g  and c  in the six libraries .figure  <dig>

validation of microrna expression by qrt-pcr
in our research, qpcr was adopted to validate the sequencing results of six mirnas , and was able to show that these mirna are really expressed, and the changes during the fruit development are real. the line charts indicate similar expression patterns as shown in figure 
 <dig>  although the values of mirna expression detected by two methods varied to some extent. so, the qpcr results confirmed the reliability and expression patterns of microrna involved in pear fruit development through high throughput sequencing.figure  <dig>

mirnas mapped on pear genome reference
using soap <dig> software, more than  <dig> million clean reads  were perfectly mapped to the pear genome
 <cit> . compared with  <dig> mirnas identified in pear genome
 <cit> , there were  <dig> newly discovered conserved mirna families which may suggest expression specifically in pear fruit, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  among them, mir <dig> has been suggested to regulate transgenic tomato flower morphology and fruit yield by targeting ca2+-atpase, si aca10
 <cit> . mir <dig> was not detected in the libraries derived from seedlings, root apices and leaves, but could be detected in libraries derived from early development stages of maize anthers
 <cit> . johnson et al.
 <cit>  proposed that mir <dig> regulated the development of reproductive structures in cereals. previous research indicated that these mirnas showed tissue-specific expression pattern and may play significant roles in plant specific tissue development. however, accurate roles for these mirnas in pear fruit still need further experimental verification.

when mapping the mirnas against pear genome reference sequences
 <cit> ,  <dig> out of the  <dig> pear mirnas could be identified on ~512mbp pear genome. the mapping result showed that a single mirna might have more than one homolog. in the additional file
 <dig>  data showed that all  <dig> chromosomes had mirnas distribution on both sense and anti-sense strands, but with uneven distribution of mirnas. the sense and anti-sense strands of chr <dig> had the greatest number of reads, while chr <dig> had the least number of reads. the results indicated that mirnas have uneven distribution on different chromosomes of pear.

mirnas were proven to present in clusters. in human, the mir <dig> cluster contains six precursor mirnas within about 1 kb on chromosome 13
 <cit> . meanwhile,  <dig> % in arabidopsis thaliana,  <dig> % in populus trichocarpa,  <dig> % in oryza sativa and  <dig> % in sorghum bicolor of mirnas have been found to cluster within a 10-kb region in previous studies
 <cit> . in this study, we found  <dig> mirna clusters at distances of 10 kb and  <dig> clusters at 100 kb . the clustering phenomenon is distributed on different regions of the genome. furthermore, different mirnas in the same cluster were shown to keep similar expression patterns, as previously reported
 <cit> . thus the targets of mirnas in the cluster were shown to have the same function. mirna genes are clustered in the genome with an arrangement and expression pattern implying transcription as a multi-cistronic primary transcript. li et al. suggested that the co-transcription of similar or identical mirnas in clusters for plants may be involved in gene dosage effect
 <cit> . when compared with previous studies in microrna identification of pear by niu et al.
 <cit> , no similar clusters were found.

mirnas comparison across pear and other plant species
mirnas in various plants, including several important fruit crops have been identified with next-generation sequencing technology. for instance, in apple, a total of  <dig> mirnas were identified according to the apple gene function & gene family database v <dig>  http://www.applegene.org/mirna.asp. in another rosaceae plant, peach,  <dig> conserved mirnas and  <dig> novel mirna candidates have been identified
 <cit> . in our analysis,  <dig> conserved mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were identified in pear, respectively. the variation of mirnas in our research can give insight to widely existing highly-conserved mirnas and can give a basis to further deep bioinformatics studies for mirnas in pear, for instance the snp identification of mirnas.

the conservation and divergence of mirnas among various plant species has been widely reported
 <cit> . in jones-rhoades’ study, mir156/ <dig>  mir <dig> and mir170/ <dig> were regarded as highly conserved mirnas, with orthologs in more than ten different plant families, while mir <dig> and mir <dig> were identified as non-conserved mirnas
 <cit> . in the perspective of zhang et al.
 <cit> , the varied conservation of mirnas suggests the multiple functions of mirnas in plant development, and the mirnas with low conservation may have species-specific characteristics in plant development.

to study the conservation and evolution of the known mirnas in pear fruit, comparisons were conducted among eleven other species including physcomitrella patens, triticum aestivum, arabidopsis lyrata, oryza sativa, sorghum bicolor, zea mays, brassica napus, prunus persica, citrus sinensis, malue domestica, and vitis vinifera . based on the analysis, several mirnas showed a high level of conservation among various plant species, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  as more than ten plant species showed high sequence homology for these mirnas. as expected, pyrus and malus domestica shared more than thirteen common conserved mirna families, exhibiting higher conservation of mirna families and high homology between the two species. on the converse, with less than five homologous mirnas, physcomitrella patens showed narrow homology relationship with pyrus. the phenomenon can be explained by speciation of plants which was accompanied with the specialization of mirnas playing species-specific roles
 <cit> .figure  <dig> 
nineteen conserved mirnas from pear fruit and their homologs in  <dig> other plant species. the color shows the homology of mirnas among the twelve plants. as the color gets closer to bright red, the relationship of the species gets closer to each other.



analysis of differentially expressed mirnas
differentially expressed mirnas were identified by comparing the sequencing reads with significant correlations  between the six libraries. taking  <dig> daf as control,  <dig> to  <dig> mirnas had significant changes among different libraries. among those mirnas, there were two  and twelve mirnas  showing an increased or decreased abundance, respectively, from 15daf to 167daf. additionally, the fluctuation patterns of mature mirnas during the developmental stages were observed, all  <dig> conserved mirnas were clustered by their expression patterns . taking the early stage  as control, there were groups of mirnas showing higher expression levels at later stages , such as mir <dig>  mir1028a-5p, mir1870-3p, mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  on the contrary, several mirnas showed a gradually decreasing expression accompanying fruit development, including mir398a*, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir390a, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  thus, the differential expression patterns of mirna for different fruit developmental stages in pear were confirmed in this study. the difference in expression profiles may suggest the relationship between mirnas and pear fruit development. at specific developmental stages, different mirnas may have the same expression pattern, which may lead to their co-regulatory role in fruit development. as for apple
 <cit> , compared with conserved mirnas, novel mirnas exhibited lower expression levels in pear.

further analysis showed that different members in the same mirna family present similar expression profiles, except in a few stages , while the expression patterns between different mirna families varied. in the study of peanut
 <cit> , the same results were also concluded. two members of the ahy-mir <dig> family were similar and this may provide valuable information on the role that mirnas play in plant growth
 <cit> .figure  <dig> 
expression profiles of members in mirna families. y-axis represents the expression level of mirnas and x-axis represents different libraries. a-e represent sequencing reads of different members in five conserved mirna families including mir4414a/4414a*, mir156k/156b*, mir167a/167a*, mir2111a*/2111a and mir164a/164c*). similar expression patterns of different members in the mirna family throughout development are shown.



mirna cluster analysis showed that members of a given cluster have parallel expression patterns, which implies that mirna cluster members coordinately regulate fruit development. it was noticeable that different clusters contained quite similar mirnas while the locations of clusters varied. the phenomenon suggests that those mirnas are always transcribed together and may be transcribed from different chromosomes or different segments on the same chromosome. a similar phenomenon has been previously reported
 <cit> . the mir- <dig> to mir- <dig> genes were clustered and showed high similarity in expression profiles
 <cit> .

target gene analysis of mirnas in pear fruit
microrna regulates gene expression through inhibiting translation or degrading mrna at a certain site
 <cit> . currently, bioinformatics methods have been used to decipher target genes in several studies
 <cit> . to better understand the roles pear mirnas play in fruit development, pickplanttar was used to predict potential mirna target genes by using the most abundant mature mirna as queries. by a stringent criteria described in the methodology,  <dig>  targets for  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig>  targets for  <dig> novel mirnas with differential expression patterns were predicted . the number of putative target genes for each conserved mirna varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  as showed in figure 
 <dig>  more than  <dig> mirnas targeted  <dig> to  <dig> genes. thirty-three mirnas had only one target gene, which may suggest a unique regulatory function played by these mirnas. meanwhile, we found that  <dig> mirnas had more than  <dig> predicted target genes. for instance, mir396b targeted  <dig> genes, the highest among the known mirnas, followed by mir <dig> and mir <dig> with  <dig> and  <dig> target gene numbers, respectively, which might indicate the wide regulation functions of these mirnas. in addition, as suggested by bonnet et al.
 <cit> , highly repetitive motifs corresponding to the mirna sequence may contribute to the ubiquity of target genes, which means the possibility of the potential false prediction. further experiments are needed to confirm the accurate function for these mirnas.figure  <dig> 
the distribution of target gene numbers for each conserved mirna among developmental stages. x-axis represents the interval for the target gene number of each conserved mirna. y-axis represents the number of mirna in each interval.



the  <dig>  targets for  <dig> known mirnas are predicted to be implicated in a broad range of physiological or biochemical processes. all annotated targets were blastx searched against the protein database, followed by gene ontology  analysis to assess the genes’ putative functions. go analysis contained three ontologies: biological process, cellular component, molecular function
 <cit> . shown as results of figure 
 <dig>   <dig> categories in biological process were classified by the genes, followed by  <dig> categories for cellular component and molecular function, respectively. as metabolic processes are the most active process in fruit development, it is understandable that cellular processes and metabolic processes were the top two go terms within biological processes. on the side of molecular function, the binding term and catalytic activity term occupied the largest numbers of genes. the result may suggest that mirnas play key roles in regulation of substance metabolism because enzymes are indispensable catalysts for fruit development.figure  <dig> 
go annotation of target genes. y-axis  represents percentages of genes identified in this study, y-axis  represents the actual gene number. the genes were annotated in three main categories including biological progress, cellular component, and molecular function .



mirnas regulate pear fruit development
the development of pear fruit is a complex process, as major changes are involved in various metabolic pathways
 <cit> . in order to uncover the role of mirna in regulating the fruit growth and maturity, the target genes of mirnas were identified by kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways according to the p-value and enrichment factor. a total of  <dig> pathways were illustrated as a result of a blast search against the kegg database . screening by the criteria described in the methods, we assessed go terms ordered by the enrichment factor . in the category of molecular function, the atpase activity had the highest go enrichment factor,  <dig> .figure  <dig> 
target gene go enrichment factor screened by the p-value. a, b and c represent three ontologies: cellular component, molecular function and biological progress respectively.



it can be concluded  that the targets of conserved mirnas are involved in all parts of plant development, from plant hormone signal transduction  to plant pathogen interaction . besides the universal target genes such as arf and udp-sugar phrophosphorylase, unusual targets were also identified. the first class of targets suggested that the mirnas take part in basic pear fruit metabolism, while the second class of targets showed the species-specific role played by mirnas in pear fruit.table  <dig> 
target genes of conserved mirnas 


*more target genes of all mirnas are listed in additional file
 <dig> 



when we further explored the relationship of some mirnas and their putative target genes , it was found that an opposite expression pattern presented in different stages of fruit development , such as mir397a, mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir396b, which suggested mirnas were involved in lignin, sugar and acid pathways of fruit development. hence, we took a deeper look at the mirnas identified that are involved in several important pear fruit development metabolic pathways, including lignin pathway, sugar and acid pathway, hormone signaling and carbohydrate metabolism activities.figure  <dig>

putative mirnas related with pear fruit lignin pathway
stone cells are one of the important features of fruit quality in pear, rarely seen in other fresh fruit. as the primary component of stone cells, lignin synthesis has direct impact on their production. lignin is an aromatic heteropolymer derived from phenylpropanoid
 <cit> . previously, there were reports that lignin may improve plant resistance to pathogens to a certain degree
 <cit> . in zinnia
 <cit> , the ccoaomt is involved in the alternative methylation pathway in lignin biosynthesis. in arabidopsis
 <cit> , overexpression of snd <dig>  a nac domain transcription factor, results in activation of the biosynthetic genes for secondary wall. in pear, wu et al. reported  <dig> lignin synthesis-related gene families and depicted their pathways
 <cit> . the rna-seq data for these genes showed that they are highly expressed in the early stages, almost 10-fold higher than near ripening.

in poplar, it has been demonstrated that overexpressed corngrass <dig> mirna, belonging to the mir <dig> family, in the transgenic poplar plant 35s:cg <dig> has dramatic effects on plant architecture and stem lignin content
 <cit> . the induction of mir <dig> in sweet potato may regulate the phenylpropanoid pathway and biosynthesis of lignin by repressing the expression of ibmyb and ibtld
 <cit> .

through go annotation of the target genes and comparison with kegg database, six mirnas  among the twelve down-regulated mirnas were shown involving in metabolic pathway and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites comprising the lignin synthesis pathway . among them,  <dig> target genes of mir397a were shown to be the most significant mirnas involved in the lignin pathway. these genes  were the homologs of ptr-lac or ath-lac. the laccase-like enzyme could catalyze coniferyl alcohol polymerization, implicating laccases in lignification
 <cit> . the transcripts per million  value for mir397a showed a decrease in the development periods, consistent with the role of pear fruit lignin synthesis showed by wu et al.
 <cit> , while the transcription of several targets showed the opposite tendency from mir397a .figure  <dig> 
relationship of mirnas and target genes in lignin pathway. the triangles, boxes and circles represent mirnas, pathways and target genes respectively.


mirnas and target genes involved in lignification and sugar and acid pathways


the conclusion was consistent with the research in populus trichocarpa
 <cit> . twenty-nine laccase genes were predicted to be targets of ptr-mir397a
 <cit> . by over expression of ptr-mir397a in the transgenic lines,  <dig> ptrlacs were down-regulated, which resulted in a ~40% decreasing of the total laccase activity, and lignin content was also reduced. the transcriptome-based gene expression implicated the ptr-mir397a and lac in co-regulating lignin biosynthesis in wood formation. the detailed function of mir397a in pear fruit lignification still needs further studies and confirmed biological experiments.

besides the mirnas with significant differential expression, several other mirnas were also analyzed according to their target gene annotation. mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> targeted the hydroxycinnamoyl transferase  gene, which is known to promote lignin synthesis
 <cit> . according to analysis in the pear genome
 <cit> , hct gene is one of the pivotal genes in synthesis of lignin in pear fruit, leading to high levels of conversion of p-coumaroyl-coa  into caffeoyl-coa  and feruloyl-coa . another two key genes analyzed in lignin synthesis peroxidase  and 4cl, are putatively targeted by mir <dig> and mir396b, respectively.

putative mirnas related with pear fruit sugar and acid pathway
pear fruit quality and flavor are largely impacted by the composition and content of sugar and acid, thus metabolism of sugar and acid is one of the most significant fruit development characteristics. kegg pathway analysis showed  <dig> sugar and acid pathways in pear fruit development, such as fructose and mannose metabolism, galactose metabolism, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. by the annotation of targets, nine mirnas were identified as related to genes taking part in the above pathways. as listed in table 
 <dig>  these include malate pepck-atp , citrate acly, malate malt .

from the differentially expressed mirnas , several mirnas have higher expression level in early phases than in mature phases. in early development phases, mir4414a* showed higher tpm . when the fruit reached the mature phase, the tpm gradually decreased . dihydrolipoyl transacetylase  was suggested to be the putative target of mir4414a*. e <dig> is one of the main enzymes of tricarboxylic acid cycle 
 <cit> , which is known for its wide role in many pivotal plant metabolism pathways.

putative mirnas regulated other pear fruit development genes
the majority of mirna molecules chosen for this study and the complementary sites within their target genes display a high degree of conservation between species. thus, the pear genome database was examined for the presence of potential mirna targets. auxin response factor , a transcription factors, regulates auxin signal transduction during plant growth. niu et al.
 <cit>  previously reported putative orthologs of arf transcription factors as targets of pear mir <dig> family. in our study, the same result was identified. mir160a potentially targets arf <dig>  arf <dig> and arf <dig>  as a companion, mir <dig> was identified to target the hypothetical proteins loc <dig> and loc <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> have been experimentally confirmed in several plant species including arabidopsis thaliana
 <cit>  and soybean
 <cit>  that bind complementary sites in the utr of arf.

known as a catalyzer of the conversion of various monosaccharide 1-phosphates to the respective udp-sugars, udp-sugar phrophosphorylase was shown to be essential in pollen development in arabidopsis
 <cit> , and was putatively targeted by mir <dig> in our analysis. while there have previously been rare reports about mir <dig>  it is necessary to do further studies to confirm its function.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig> conserved mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas for pear fruit at different developmental stages using the illumina hiseq <dig> sequencing method. through comparison with the pear genome, the transcript sites for these mirnas were located. fourteen mirna clusters at 1 kb and  <dig> mirna clusters at 10 kb were identified, respectively. analysis of differential expression data suggested some roles for mirnas in pear fruit development. combined with target prediction and go enrichment analysis,  <dig> targets for  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig>  targets for  <dig> novel mirnas were predicted and their functions shown. several fruit development pathways were analyzed including lignin pathway, sugar and acid pathway, and hormone signaling. combined with computational analysis and experimental confirmation, the research contributes valuable information for further functional research of microrna in fruit development for pear and other species.
