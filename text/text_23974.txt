BACKGROUND
the culex pipiens complex includes two of the most ubiquitous mosquito species in the world, culex quinquefasciatus say,  <dig> in tropical and subtropical regions, and culex pipiens l.,  <dig> in temperate regions. the nominal species of the complex, cx. pipiens s.s., comprises two distinct forms, denoted pipiens and molestus, that are morphologically indistinguishable but exhibit important behavioural and physiological differences. the molestus form is stenogamous , autogenous , mammophilic  and homodynamic . in contrast, the pipiens form is eurygamous , anautogenous , ornithophilic  and heterodynamic   <cit> . in the northern regions of europe, russia and usa, molestus and pipiens forms occupy different habitats, underground and aboveground, respectively  <cit> .

the taxonomic status and evolutionary relationships of these forms remain controversial. one hypothesis is that the molestus form derives from surface pipiens populations that have undergone local adaptation to underground conditions  <cit> . another hypothesis is that these forms may represent two distinct genetic entities  <cit> . under the latter scenario, underground populations from northern europe would have derived from southern autogenous populations that have subsequently dispersed and colonised underground habitats  <cit> . if in northern regions a physical discontinuity  is likely to significantly reduce gene flow between molestus and pipiens, hence promoting genetic isolation, the same may not hold for southern regions, where both autogenous and anautogenous populations co-occur in surface habitats  <cit> . moreover, individuals with hybrid genetic signatures between molestus and pipiens have been described both in the usa and in southern europe  <cit> . these results agree with reports of hybridisation between forms that result in hybrid females with intermediate physiological and behavioural traits  <cit> . hybrids between molestus and pipiens forms are considered of great epidemiological importance. they can readily feed on both avian and mammalian hosts, including humans. this opportunistic biting behaviour will potentiate the role of cx. pipiens as a bridge-vector for the transmission of arboviruses such as west nile virus , from their amplification hosts  to humans  <cit> .

despite the conspicuous behavioural and physiological differences between molestus and pipiens, analysis of molecular markers revealed overall shallow genetic divergence and a paucity of diagnostic fixed differences between forms  <cit> . exceptions are the contrasting differences in the degree of polymorphism found in the sh <dig> locus, a cx. pipiens specific fragment originally described by crabtree and co-workers  <cit>  to distinguish this species from its tropical sibling cx. quinquefasciatus, and the significant differentiation detected by analysis of microsatellites  <cit> . the most promising diagnostic marker so far obtained is a sequence difference in the flanking region of microsatellite cq <dig>  hereafter termed cq11fl, that allows pcr-based discrimination of molestus, pipiens and putative hybrids  <cit> .

in portugal, cx. pipiens is the most widespread mosquito species, reaching the highest densities in coastal estuarine areas during summer  <cit> . some of these areas are important sanctuaries for migratory birds and hence potential sites for the introduction of arbovirus  <cit> . in the summer of  <dig>  wnv was isolated from cx. pipiens collected in the southern province of the algarve, in a mosquito survey that followed the description of two cases of wnv fever acquired by irish bird-watchers in the region  <cit> . in portugal, autogenous/stenogamous cx. pipiens, typical of the molestus form, have been described from the analysis of larvae collected in urban surface habitats  <cit> . however, there is currently no information on the extent of genetic isolation between molestus and pipiens forms when they co-occur sympatrically in southern european aboveground habitats.

in this study, we used the cq11fl marker and microsatellite loci to analyse samples of culex pipiens collected aboveground in the estuarine region of comporta in order to: i) determine levels of differentiation between samples displaying behavioural and physiological characteristics of pipiens and molestus forms; ii) assess the degree of hybridisation between forms and relate this with the potential for arbovirus transmission in the area.

RESULTS
autogeny, stenogamy and molecular identification
a total of  <dig> f <dig> families were analysed in the insectary to determine autogeny and stenogamy . of these,  <dig>  were able to lay a first egg batch without blood feeding, hence being considered autogenous. the great majority of autogenous families  laid the first egg batch within two days after the emergence of the last adult. in the remaining  <dig> families , oviposition occurred only after blood feeding in  <dig>  and no oviposition was seen in the other  <dig>  during the  <dig> days of the experiment. for subsequent comparisons, these families were put together into a single group denoted as non-autogenous.

ins: proportion of inseminated females in each family.

there were significant associations of autogenous families with complete insemination and of non-autogenous families with absence of insemination . in the autogenous group, the mean proportion of inseminated females was  <dig> %, with  <dig> families  showing 100% of inseminated females. there was a single autogenous family in which insemination was not observed. this family oviposited without blood feeding only after the two-days period from the emergence of the last adult, after which the family was subdivided . in this family, the level of insemination could have been too low to accurately determining the insemination rate by observing the spermathecae, but also the possibility of a parthenogenic egg batch cannot be excluded  <cit> . in contrast, the non-autogenous group had a mean proportion of inseminated females of  <dig> % and no inseminated females were observed in  <dig>  families. the remaining  <dig> inseminated families all laid eggs but only after blood feeding. the frequency distribution of insemination rates was bimodal, with most of the observations concentrating in the extreme values . more than 91% of the autogenous families had insemination rates above 80% whereas over 93% of the non-autogenous families had insemination rates below 20%.

a total of  <dig> females were molecularly analysed, representing one female per family. of these,  <dig>  were identified as cx. pipiens s.s. by ace2-pcr  <cit> . for the remaining  <dig> females no amplified product was obtained despite several attempts changing pcr conditions, possibly due to alterations in the primers binding site. the families of these specimens were identified as belonging to cx. pipiens s.s. by the observation of the genitalia of male siblings  <cit> .

the genotypic frequencies of the cq11fl marker are shown in table  <dig>  overall,  <dig>  females were homozygous for the  <dig> bp allele characteristic of the molestus form and  <dig>  were homozygous for the  <dig> bp allele associated with the pipiens form. the remainder  <dig>  females were heterozygous. there were significant associations between homozygous genotypes and alternative phenotypic traits. the "pipiens" genotype  predominated in non-autogenous and strictly non-stenogamous families  whereas the "molestus" genotype  was predominant in autogenous and strictly stenogamous families .

microsatellite analysis
genetic diversity estimates for the  <dig> microsatellite loci analysed are shown in table s <dig>  available in the additional file  <dig>  apart from the whole sample , calculations were also made for subsamples determined by genotypes at the cq11fl locus. although coincidence of genotypes and phenotypes was not absolute, the significant associations between cq11fl homozygous genotypes and alternative phenotypes justified this tentative partitioning. diversity estimates were lower in cq11fl250/ <dig> homozygotes  when compared to cq11fl200/ <dig> homozygotes . these differences were significant for both parameters . microsatellite cq <dig> was polymorphic in cq11fl200/ <dig> homozygous and in cq11fl200/ <dig> heterozygous groups. in contrast, this locus was nearly fixed for a  <dig> bp allele  in the cq11fl250/ <dig> homozygous group. this allele was also the most frequent in the heterozygous group  while it was absent in cq11fl200/ <dig> homozygotes.

significant departures from hardy-weinberg proportions were detected in  <dig> loci  when all specimens were analysed as a single sample . significant departures were seen at the same loci when analysis was repeated with pooled cq11fl250/ <dig> and cq11fl200/ <dig> homozygous specimens, i.e. when cq11fl200/ <dig> heterozygotes were excluded . these departures were generally associated with significant positive fis values indicative of a heterozygote deficit . however, when the sample was subdivided according to cq11fl genotypes, significant heterozygote deficits were observed only in seven occasions . of these, locus cxpgt <dig> exhibited heterozygote deficits in all three subsamples, possibly reflecting locus-specific effects such as null alleles or selective pressures. there was also one significant departure that resulted from heterozygous excess, namely for locus cq <dig> in the cq11fl200/ <dig> heterozygous group.

exact tests of linkage disequilibrium revealed  <dig>  significant associations between pairs of loci out of  <dig> tests performed for the whole sample. when each form was treated in separate, significant associations were reduced to  <dig> in the cq11fl250/ <dig> homozygous group, four in cq11fl200/ <dig> homozygous and one in cq11fl200/ <dig> heterozygous. of the total  <dig> significant tests detected in the subsamples nine involved locus cxpgt <dig>  that also showed significant heterozygote deficits. this locus was therefore excluded from subsequent analyses.

bayesian clustering analysis implemented by structure  <cit>  revealed two  genetically distinct ancestry clusters . cluster  <dig> grouped  <dig> specimens,  <dig>  of which had a homozygous cq11fl250/ <dig> genotype and seven  were cq11fl200/ <dig> homozygotes. interestingly, all  <dig> specimens assigned to cluster  <dig> belonged to autogenous families, with nearly 80% of these having 100% insemination rates and with all families displaying at least some proportion of inseminated females, thus providing support for cluster  <dig> to represent the molestus form . in contrast, cluster  <dig> was representative of the pipiens form, with  <dig>  out of the  <dig> specimens assigned presenting a cq11fl200/ <dig> homozygous genotype and only two  were cq11fl250/ <dig> homozygotes. in this cluster, 75% of females belonged to non-autogenous families and nearly 65% were from families with no insemination. none of the females assigned to cluster  <dig> belonged to families with 100% insemination. very similar results were obtained when microsatellite cq <dig>  which exhibited the highest allelic differences between cq11fl genotypes, was removed from the analysis . with the exception of three individuals, all the remaining  <dig>  specimens were assigned in to the same clusters as in the previous analysis, indicating that subdivision was not locus-dependent.

there were  <dig>  individuals of the total sample  exhibiting an admixed ancestry . of these, only  <dig>  had a heterozygous cq11fl200/ <dig> genotype while the majority  were homozygous for either of the two alleles present at the cq11fl locus. regarding phenotypes, the proportion of admixed individuals was lower in families that displayed alternative extreme traits  when compared to the remaining families that were either autogenous or non-autogenous with a varying proportion of insemination above 0% and below 100% .

the microsatellite allele frequency arrays together with estimates of allele richness  and private allele richness  for the clusters representative of the molestus and pipiens forms are shown in figure  <dig>  allelic diversity was higher in the pipiens cluster, with a mean ar of  <dig> compared to a mean estimate of  <dig> for the molestus cluster. most but not all of the alleles found in the molestus cluster were also represented in the pipiens cluster. in the molestus cluster par estimates per locus varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  whereas in the pipiens cluster par ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . the pipiens and molestus clusters shared the most frequent allele at only four loci. for the remainder  <dig> loci, the most frequent alleles at each cluster were separated from each other on average by  <dig> basepairs, or four mutational steps  as expected from their dinucleotide repeat constitution. the most remarkable difference was found in cq <dig>  with the most frequent alleles of pipiens and molestus being separated by  <dig> mutational steps.

heterozygosity tests provided no evidence of recent population contraction in both molestus and pipiens clusters . there was a single departure from mutation drift equilibrium  in the pipiens cluster, that resulted from an apparent heterozygote deficiency  suggestive of population expansion and under the strict stepwise mutation model .

a global fst of  <dig>  was obtained when subsamples were arranged according to the assignment into ancestry clusters revealed by structure  <cit>  . the comparison between cluster  <dig>  and cluster  <dig>  yielded a significant fst of  <dig> . differentiation was generalised, in that significant fst values were observed in  <dig> out of the  <dig> loci analysed, as shown in table s <dig> of the additional file  <dig>  the single exception was locus cxqgt <dig>  that was nearly monomorphic for the same allele in both forms . locus cq <dig> exhibited the highest fst value  compared to the remaining loci . excluding this locus from analysis resulted in a decrease of the overall fst between molestus and pipiens to  <dig> . similar results were obtained with the rst estimator . in comparisons between molestus and pipiens, rst was higher than fst in  <dig> out of  <dig> loci and the mean over-loci estimates were also higher, with  and without locus cq <dig> .

the results of the admixture analysis performed by newhybrids  <cit>  on simulated genotypes generated by hybridlab  <cit>  are shown in figure  <dig> and in table s <dig> of the additional file  <dig>  maximum accuracy was achieved for all tq but there were variations in power. all parental individuals were correctly identified at tq =  <dig>  . at this threshold, 93% of f <dig> hybrids were correctly assigned. maximum power  was obtained for this class at a tq =  <dig> . the analysis performed poorly in the assignment of the remaining hybrid classes, with proportions of correctly assigned individuals below 85% regardless of tq. given this poor performance, posterior probabilities of hybrid classes were summed and used as an estimate for the detection of hybrids but without definition of their admixture ancestry . for this category, maximum power was achieved only for tq =  <dig> . based on these results, thresholds of  <dig>  and  <dig>  were used for the detection of hybrids on the real dataset.

all individuals with a molestus ancestry  revealed by structure  <cit>  were assigned to the same purebred class by newhybrids  <cit>  with probabilities of assignment close to  <dig> . in addition, five individuals of admixed ancestry were also included in this class. in contrast, of the  <dig> specimens with pipiens ancestry, only  <dig>  displayed a qi â‰¥  <dig>  of being assigned as parental pipiens . at tq =  <dig>  this number decreased to  <dig>  with a minimum qi =  <dig> . the individual probabilities of assignment into the parental pipiens class were lower than those of purebred molestus. for individuals assigned as parental pipiens, the average proportion of assignment into a different class  was  <dig>  for tq =  <dig>  and  <dig>  for tq =  <dig> .

depending on the threshold, the proportion of hybrid individuals detected by newhybrids  <cit>  varied between  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , values comparable to the  <dig> % proportion obtained by structure  <cit>  analysis .

* at this threshold, only  <dig> specimens were assigned to classes. the remainder  <dig> analysed individuals presented qi< <dig>  of belonging to any of the classes and were thus undetermined.

discussion
insectary experiments based on the progeny of field-caught cx. pipiens females revealed strong associations between alternative traits that define molestus and pipiens forms. the highest proportions of inseminated females were seen in autogenous families. these two associated traits are expected for an autogenous/stenogamous molestus population. conversely, non-autogenous families exhibited the lowest insemination rates suggesting that these families represent the anautogenous/eurygamic pipiens population. the non-autogenous group included families that oviposited after a blood meal and those in which no oviposition was detected throughout the experiment. factors such as poor adaptation to insectary conditions causing gonotrophic dissociation could have resulted in the absence of oviposition in families that otherwise could in fact be autogenous. on the other hand, low insemination rates could also determine the lack of oviposition. coincidently, no inseminated females were detected in all the  <dig> families that did not oviposit after blood feeding. under the experimental conditions used, absence of insemination reflects the inability of mating in confined spaces, a trait of the pipiens form.

the observed phenotypic separation was confirmed by microsatellite analysis. extensive heterozygote deficits and linkage between loci were detected when all individuals were treated as a single sample. these departures were greatly reduced when the sample was tentatively subdivided into subsamples defined by the cq11fl locus, a single-locus marker available to distinguish molestus and pipiens forms  <cit> . the bayesian method of pritchard and co-workers  <cit>  identifies clusters from multilocus genotypic frequencies based on the minimisation of departures from hardy-weinberg equilibrium and of linkage disequilibrium between loci. this analysis revealed two distinct genetic clusters that were largely coincident with the molestus and pipiens forms defined by both the phenotypic traits and the cq11fl locus. altogether, these results suggest that molestus and pipiens forms represent distinct gene pools of a subdivided cx. pipiens population.

from the comparison with the ancestry groups revealed by structure  <cit> , cq11fl was only partially effective as a diagnostic marker. there was a good concordance between alternative homozygous genotypes and each form but heterozygous cq11fl genotypes performed less well in determining admixed individuals. under conditions of continued hybridisation, recombination and independent assortment will break the linkage between alternative diagnostic genotypes and their respective genetic ancestry background. as pointed by bahnck and fonseca  <cit> , results from this marker should thus be interpreted only at the population level. nevertheless cq11fl still served as a good indicator of the sympatric presence of both molestus and pipiens forms in the study area.

based on the partitioning of samples according to ancestry clusters revealed by structure  <cit> , a global fst of  <dig>  was obtained between molestus and pipiens forms. this estimate is slightly lower but still comparable to those reported in previous comparisons between underground molestus and aboveground pipiens populations  using similar microsatellite datasets  <cit> . although no molestus underground populations from the study area were available for comparison, it appears that gene flow between molestus and pipiens forms is not significantly increased by the sympatric co-existence of both populations in the surface. this argument plays in favour of the hypothesis of at least partial reproductive isolation between molestus and pipiens forms and that the under/aboveground physical discontinuity is not the only factor promoting genetic divergence, as previously debated  <cit> . under this particular situation of sympatry, positive reinforcement may play a role in counteracting the effects of gene flow  <cit> , hence maintaining isolation between forms.

microsatellite cq <dig> displayed the highest differentiation between molestus and pipiens, with an fst estimate ca. 2-fold greater than for the other loci. this locus was close to fixation in molestus form for a  <dig> bp allele, but this was a low-frequency allele in the pipiens form . this allelic profile is not unique for the study area. high frequencies of a cq <dig> allele in the same size range  have been reported for underground and aboveground molestus populations from europe and the usa  <cit> . this continental-wide genetic signature is consistent with a single evolutionary origin of the molestus form, possibly arising in the southern latitudes of europe or north africa as a human-adapted commensal form, that later dispersed into northern latitudes as underground suitable habitats became available  <cit> . furthermore, this locus-specific differentiation may indicate that cq <dig> locates in a genomic region under divergent selection. in these genomic regions, reduced recombination and selection against introgression maintain differentiation not only at loci associated with traits of ecological adaptation or reproductive isolation but also at surrounding neutral loci through genetic hitchhiking  <cit> . this mechanism is considered a major process of sympatric/ecological speciation and has been described in several insect species  <cit> . genome-wide scans will be necessary to confirm the presence of such genomic regions in cx. pipiens.

estimates of hybrid rates between molestus and pipiens forms between 7-10% were obtained by structure  <cit>  and newhybrids  <cit>  admixture analysis. these values are similar to the estimates obtained for southern european aboveground populations  using structure  <cit> , although the authors used a different tq of  <dig>   <cit> . adjusting ancestry assignment to this threshold still yielded a comparable hybrid rate of  <dig> % for our sample. in comparisons between underground molestus and aboveground pipiens populations from the usa hybrid rates of 12% have been documented  <cit>  but up to 40% admixed individuals have been documented in usa cx. pipiens populations by fonseca and co-workers  <cit> . according to the authors, a more recent colonisation and posterior contact of separate old world molestus and pipiens populations may explain the higher levels of hybridisation found in the usa. on the other hand, the low levels of hybridisation in southern european cx. pipiens populations, even when both forms occur sympatrically as here demonstrated, provides additional support for reproductive/ecological barriers to gene flow other than habitat segregation.

the degree of microsatellite differentiation in our dataset was insufficient to identify hybrids beyond the f <dig> class, as revealed by the analysis of simulated data. this was not an unexpected result as newhybrids  <cit>  often requires a large number of highly diagnostic markers between populations to identify f <dig> and backcrossed hybrids with confidence  <cit> . however, this analysis revealed important differences in the proportions of admixture within forms. individuals with molestus ancestry were all classified as purebred molestus with probabilities of assignment above  <dig> . in contrast, individuals with pipiens ancestry had a mean proportion of admixture of  <dig>   and 28-48%  were classified as hybrids. these differences suggest a pattern of asymmetrical gene flow, in which higher proportions of molestus alleles are introgressed into the pipiens form. a similar trend has also been described in a population from chicago il , in which the pipiens form presented higher proportions of molestus and cx. quinquefasciatus ancestry  <cit> .

another hypothesis could be raised if the molestus form would have locally evolved from the pipiens form through a recent founding event. under this scenario, the microsatellite composition of the molestus population would be made almost exclusively of only a subset of the alleles present in the pipiens form which might result in an apparent signal of admixture in the latter. while estimates of allele and private allele richness seem to support this view, there were considerable differences between forms in the microsatellite allele arrays that are not consistent with this hypothesis. these differences are illustrated by the number of mutational steps separating the most frequent alleles at each locus. size variance-based rst values were higher than frequency-based fst values in nearly half of the loci and also for the mean over-loci estimates. higher rst estimates do not conciliate with a recent founding event that would otherwise imply that genetic drift rather than mutation would be the primary evolutionary force shaping genetic divergence between forms  <cit> . moreover, heterozygosity tests provided no evidence for the molestus form to have recently undergone any major population reduction that would be expected from a founding event. finally, the peculiar composition of the cq <dig> microsatellite in the molestus form, displaying a high frequency allele common to all other molestus populations regardless of geographic origin is also not consistent with local multiple origins of the molestus form. altogether, these evidences render the hypothesis of the molestus population being derived from the local pipiens form unlikely. extending the analysis to other regions of sympatry between molestus and pipiens would provide insights on whether the observed patterns of introgression are a local phenomenon or a general trend for the species in its southern distribution.

the mechanisms underlying the patterns of asymmetrical introgression between molestus and pipiens are unknown. one hypothesis can be drawn from the different mating strategies displayed by molestus and pipiens forms. preferential introgression from molestus to pipiens could be expected if stenogamous molestus males mate readily with both molestus and pipiens females in aboveground habitats. on the other hand, pipiens males require open spaces to mate due to swarm-based mating behaviour  <cit> . this more specialised behaviour may result in a higher propensity to mate with pipiens females. this hypothesis relies on two main assumptions. the first is that introgression between molestus and pipiens is mainly male-mediated and to test for this hypothesis the analysis of sex-linked markers would be required. in a recent study analysing asian populations of two additional members of the cx. pipiens complex, the allele specific of cx. quinquefasciatus at the sex-linked ace- <dig> locus was found to have introgressed into culex pipiens pallens coquillett,  <dig> through the males  <cit> . patterns of male-mediated asymmetrical introgression have also been reported in several other non-insect organisms, such as tree frogs  <cit> , warbler birds  <cit> , mouse lemurs  <cit>  and macaque monkeys  <cit> . the second assumption is that both pipiens and hybrid females have a greater propensity for seeking swarms for mating. to address this question, more studies are needed to characterise the swarming and mating behaviours in cx. pipiens, in areas of sympatry between forms.

the molestus form was predominant in the study area and this trend appeared to be maintained throughout the year . while this factor may also contribute to a higher introgression of genes from molestus to pipiens, it may also suggest fitness differences between forms. in southern regions with mild winters, the inability of the molestus form to undergo diapause during winter may be a lesser disadvantage than at northern latitudes. when occurring in sympatry with the pipiens form in surface habitats, autogeny and a more generalist mating behaviour are likely to result in a greater fitness molestus form.

CONCLUSIONS
both physiological/behavioural and genetic data provide evidence for the sympatric occurrence of molestus and pipiens forms of cx. pipiens in aboveground habitats of the study area. in spite of the sympatric occurrence, estimated hybridisation rates were not much higher than those reported in ecological settings where both forms are physically separated which suggests at least partial reproductive isolation between molestus and pipiens. more importantly, hybridisation appears not to be bidirectional and this is possibly a result of the different mating strategies exhibited by each form. the observed patterns of asymmetrical introgression may have epidemiological repercussions. in two recent studies covering three usa states, pipiens form females that have fed upon mammals  presented significantly higher proportions of molestus genetic ancestry  <cit> . these findings suggest a genetic basis for host selection by cx. pipiens. the introgression of molestus genes into the pipiens form may induce a more opportunistic biting behaviour thus potentiating the capacity of the latter form to act as a bridge-vector for the transmission of arbovirus such as wnv  <cit> . further studies focusing on the feeding habits and population dynamics of molestus and pipiens forms are required in order to clarify the impact of hybridisation in the vectorial capacity of cx. pipiens and, consequently, on the potential for transmission of arboviral infections.
