BACKGROUND
uptake of phosphate by bacteria most commonly occurs via two systems, the low-affinity, constitutively expressed pit system, and the high-affinity, phosphate-starvation induced pst system  <cit> . pit systems consist of a single membrane protein, encoded by pita or pitb, and are energized by the proton motive force  <cit> . pst systems are multi-subunit abc transporters, usually encoded by a four-gene operon, pstscab  <cit> . several bacterial species also contain additional transporters for the uptake of alternative phosphorus-compounds. examples include the ptx and htx systems of pseudomonas stutzeri, which transport phosphonates, phosphite and hypophosphite  <cit> , and the phn-system for the uptake of phosphonates in e. coli and several other gram-negative bacteria  <cit> .

mycobacteria appear unique in that they contain several copies of high-affinity systems specific for phosphate: in the pathogenic species, such as m. tuberculosis, m. bovis and m. leprae, this is due to duplication of the pst genes  <cit> . for example, m. tuberculosis contains three different copies of psts, two copies each of pstc and psta, and one copy of pstb  <cit> , plus a homologous gene, phot, which has been shown to fulfill the same function as pstb in m. bovis  <cit> . expression of all three copies of psts under phosphate-limited conditions has been shown for m. bovis bcg  <cit> , although a recent microarray analysis of phosphate-limited m. tuberculosis only found one of the pst-operons to be upregulated  <cit> .

the environmental species m. smegmatis possesses only a single copy of the pst-operon, but it also contains a second operon, phndce, which encodes another phosphate-specific high-affinity transporter  <cit> . furthermore, a third, as yet unidentified, high-affinity phosphate transport system may be present in m. smegmatis, because a phnd/psts double deletion mutant still retained phosphate uptake activity with a km-value of around  <dig> μm, which is similar to the values of the pst and phn systems  <cit> .

despite this abundance of high-affinity transporters, all mycobacterial genomes available to date also contain a pita gene, encoding the low-affinity system, with the genome of m. tuberculosis containing a second pit system, encoded by pitb  <cit> . the present study was directed at investigating the role of the low-affinity phosphate transporter in a bacterium containing at least two high-affinity systems, using the model of m. smegmatis.

RESULTS
pita is constitutively expressed
previous studies of pit systems have focused on gram-negative bacteria, where pita expression is independent of phosphate concentrations  <cit> , while pitb of e. coli and the pit-like gene of sinorhizobium meliloti are repressed at low phosphate concentrations  <cit> . to study the expression of m. smegmatis pita, a low-copy number transcriptional pita-lacz fusion  was introduced into wild-type m. smegmatis. the resulting strain had β-galactosidase activities of about  <dig> miller units , both when grown in st medium containing  <dig> mm phosphate and after  <dig> h starvation in phosphate-free st medium . pit systems of gram-negatives recognize a metal-phosphate complex  as substrate  <cit> . it was therefore possible that expression of m. smegmatis pita was regulated by the availability of such mehpo <dig> complexes, free divalent cations  or ph, as the latter influences the distribution of the different phosphate species in solution  <cit> . we tested the pita-lacz reporter strain after  <dig> h incubation in mg2+-free st medium, exposure to  <dig> mm edta, or incubation in st medium buffered to ph  <dig> or ph  <dig>  under all conditions tested β-galactosidase activities were in the range between  <dig> mu and  <dig> mu . no significant differences to the control condition were observed , suggesting that expression of m. smegmatis pita was constitutive under all conditions tested.

a pita deletion mutant has no growth defect in vitro
to determine if pita played a role in growth and phosphate uptake of m. smegmatis, we next constructed an unmarked pita deletion strain by an adaptation of the two-step protocol used previously to create a double-kanamycin marked mutant of m. smegmatis  <cit>  . in the first step of mutagenesis, the construct was integrated into the chromosome by growth at 40°c. southern hybridization analysis showed that correct integration had occurred via a cross-over event in the left flank . excision of the plasmid backbone through a second cross-over event was then selected for by growth on 10% sucrose. this second cross-over could lead either to reversion to wild-type or to deletion of the target gene. nine colonies were screened by southern hybridization, of which four had reverted back to the wild-type pattern, while five displayed the correct band pattern of a pita deletion mutant . one of the latter was chosen for further characterization.

growth experiments showed no difference between wild-type and pita mutant in lbt medium or st medium, either under phosphate-replete conditions  or phosphate-limited conditions  . this characteristic of the pita mutant is markedly different from the previously created m. smegmatis mutants in the high-affinity phosphate transporters, which were unable to grow in minimal medium at  <dig> mm phosphate or below  <cit> . as mentioned above, pit systems of gram-negative bacteria transport a metal-phosphate complex. while no information regarding their substrate is available for pit systems of gram-positives, a mutant of bacillus subtilis carrying an uncharacterized mutation in phosphate uptake was also defective in uptake of metal ions  <cit> , suggesting an interrelation between uptake of phosphate and metals. the biological role of pit in a bacterium with a plethora of high-affinity phosphate transporters may therefore be in uptake of divalent metal ions. to test this, we performed growth experiments in mg2+-limited st medium , but could not discern a difference between the pita and wild-type strain . because the distribution of mehpo <dig> versus free phosphate depends on the medium ph, with mehpo <dig> being the predominant species at high ph values  <cit> , it was conceivable that the physiological role of pit is to act under conditions where most phosphate is present as mehpo <dig>  to simulate such a condition in vitro, we modified the st medium to contain a high concentration of mgcl <dig>  and low concentration of phosphate  and adjusted the ph to  <dig>  . no difference was found between the wild-type and pita mutant strains . an e. coli pita mutant displayed increased resistance to toxic divalent cations , due to reduced uptake of these ions  <cit> . the m. smegmatis pita mutant and wild-type strain were therefore grown on solid media  containing 1- <dig> mm znso <dig> or cuso <dig>  both strains were able to grow in the presence of  <dig> mm of either salt, but could not grow at concentrations of  <dig> mm or higher. taken together, the data presented here suggest that either pita of m. smegmatis does not transport mehpo <dig>  or that one or both of the high-affinity systems also recognize such a complex as substrate. it should be noted that no substrate specificities have been determined to date for a pst system from a gram-positive bacterium, or for a phn system.

the pita mutant displays no defect in phosphate uptake
we next determined the rates and kinetics of uptake of ortho-phosphate, to assess whether the pita deletion strain had a defect in phosphate uptake. to prevent induction of the pst or phn systems, cells were grown in lbt medium as described in the methods section. as shown in figure  <dig>  maximum uptake rates were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol min- <dig> mg protein- <dig> for the wild-type, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nmol min- <dig> mg protein- <dig> for the pita strain. kd values were similar between the strains, with  <dig>  ±  <dig> μm phosphate for the wild-type and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm phosphate for the pita strain. slight differences in transport rates at the higher phosphate concentrations were not significant .

these kinetic parameters suggest that the rates of transport determined are due to activity of the high-affinity systems, because kd values of phosphate uptake under phosphate-starved  conditions were found to be between  <dig> and  <dig> μm phosphate  <cit> . the rates of transport in the present study are about ten-fold lower than those in phosphate-starved cells, consistent with the previously described 20-fold lower expression from the pst and phn promoters under these conditions  <cit> . pita of m. smegmatis therefore appears to be either not active, or to have a very low activity, which cannot be detected over the background of the high-affinity systems using the assay employed here. considering the abundance of phosphate transport systems in m. smegmatis, we hypothesized that loss of pita is easily compensated for by increased use of the pst and phn systems.

deletion of pita causes increased expression of the pst and phn systems
to address the question whether the pita deletion mutant employs increased expression of either the pst or phn system to compensate for the deletion, we introduced the previously created transcriptional psts-lacz  and phnd-lacz  fusion constructs  <cit>  into the pita deletion background. as shown in figure  <dig>  under phosphate-replete conditions the activity of both promoters was increased by about two-fold in the pita strain. complementation of the deletion with a single copy of pita under control of its native promoter restored expression of psts-lacz and phnd-lacz to wild-type levels. no differences between strains were observed in phosphate-starved cells . these data imply that pita is indeed used for phosphate uptake under high phosphate conditions by m. smegmatis, but that loss of this system is easily compensated for by the remaining phosphate transporters.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we here show that the pita system of m. smegmatis is constitutively expressed under a variety of growth conditions, and that deletion of the pita gene does not appear to affect growth or phosphate uptake in vitro. this is presumably due to compensation of the deletion by increased expression of the high-affinity phosphate transport systems, pstscab and phndce.

the lack of phenotype of the pita mutant under the growth conditions tested here, together with the wild-type levels of phosphate uptake in the mutant strain, raises the question as to why mycobacteria still contain this transporter. this point is further emphasized by the presence of a functional pita gene in m. leprae, whose genome has undergone reductions and decay to the point where the bacterium is unable to replicate outside of its host  <cit> . the answer may be found in the energetics of transport: pit systems transport metal-phosphate in symport with protons at a stoichiometry of 1: <dig>  <cit> , while the pst and phn systems are abc-transporters and thus likely require hydrolysis of two atp per substrate transported  <cit> . uptake of phosphate via the pit system is therefore energetically less expensive to the cell, and this could be important under conditions where energy is limiting. however, there was no significant difference in the molar growth yield  between the pita deletion mutant and the wild-type when grown under carbon limitation in continuous culture at a dilution rate of  <dig>  h- <dig>  . we therefore hypothesize that a phenotype for a pita mutant of mycobacteria may well only manifest itself in vivo under conditions where the cell is exposed to multiple limitations , such as are commonly found in the intraphagosomal environment of the pathogens or the soil habitat of environmental species.
