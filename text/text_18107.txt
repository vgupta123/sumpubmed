BACKGROUND
dengue virus , a mosquito-borne rna virus, belonged to the genus flavivirus of the family flaviviridae, is the cause of a range of well described clinical diseases, dengue fever , dengue shock syndrome  and dengue hemorrhagic fever   <cit> . globally, over  <dig>  billion people are at risk for denv infection in tropical and subtropical countries and regions, and approximately  <dig> to  <dig> million new cases of dengue infection and  <dig>  cases of dhf and/or dss occur annually  <cit> . prevention and control of widespread dengue infection has been a priority of the world health organization  for three decades; however, a licensed vaccine for denv is not yet available  <cit> .

there are four antigenically distinct serotypes of denv, designated as denv1- <dig>  dengue fever can be caused by any one of these four serotypes and life-long immunity against a distinct serotype can be established after infection. however, the severe forms of denv infection, dhf and dss, often occur when individuals are infected a second time by a different serotype  <cit> . the increased severity of subsequent infections is believed to result, at least in part, from antibody-dependent enhancement  of denv infection, in which antibody-mediated neutralization does not occur. instead, virus-antibody complexes facilitate viral entry into cells that express the fcγ receptor, such as monocytes and macrophages  <cit> . for these reasons, an effective dengue vaccine should be able to induce long-lived protective immunity simultaneously against all four denv serotypes.

three structural proteins , premembrane/membrane  and envelope ) and seven nonstructural proteins  are encoded in the rna genome of the dengue virus. the c protein forms the main structural component of the nucleocapsid  <cit>  and the formation of m, from prm, appears to be the crucial, terminal event in virion morphogenesis  <cit> . the e protein is located on the surface of mature dengue virions and is the principal glycosylated structural protein . the e protein mediates viral entry and induces a protective immune response  <cit> . the antibody response to denv infection is mainly directed against the e and prm glycoproteins that are present on the virion surface  <cit> . antibodies have been found to both neutralize and enhance denv infectivity, in vivo and in vitro, and thus appear to play a dual role in controlling denv infection  <cit> . presumably, this adverse association might predict a potential risk for development of dhf or dss in an individual who had previously been vaccinated with a specific denv serotype and then is subsequently infected with a different serotype. indeed, the majority of denv vaccines under development are multivalent and aimed at producing immunity potent enough to protect against all four denv serotypes  <cit> .

recent advances in genetic manipulation and vaccinology have lead to renewed hope for the development of live attenuated vaccines, subunit vaccines, dna vaccines and viral-vector vaccines. of particular interest is the effort to develop recombinant subunit vaccines, based on the viral proteins, capable of mimicking the overall structure of viral particles and inducing an optimal immune response. to this end, the virus-like particles  approach appears promising and advantageous over many other structural forms of vaccines. vlps have been found to provide high immunogenic potency in protecting against various pathogens, such as human papillomavirus  <cit> .

it has been demonstrated that co-expression of flavivirus prm and e, or alternatively, c, prm, and e led to production of vlps that were composed of spherical membrane vesicles containing prm/m and e embedded in a lipid bilayer with or without a nucleocapsid, similar to the morphology of natural virions. these vlps showed immunogenicity and were able to elicit neutralizing antibodies and virus-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes  <cit> . our previous studies demonstrated that co-expression of the prm and e proteins of denv <dig>  denv <dig>  and denv <dig> produced antigenic denv-vlp  <cit> . in the current study, denv4-vlp was constructed and expressed, and the immunological properties and protection level of tetravalent denv-vlp were evaluated in mice challenged with all four denv serotypes. the data suggest that antibody responses and cellular immunity induced by monovalent and tetravalent denv-vlp were comparable. tetravalent denv-vlp had better protective efficacy compared to monovalent vlp in suckling mice. the results indicate that tetravalent denv-vlp could be a promising vaccine candidate.

discussion
vlps have similar structural and physicochemical features to infectious virions, however they are non-infectious and have advantages in terms of safety and manufacturing. an important characteristic of vlps is that they can elicit strong humoral and cellular immune responses against viruses  <cit> . recombinant flaviviruses vlps have been shown to be able to be efficiently produced by co-expression of prm and e proteins, either with or without c proteins  <cit> . our previous study demonstrated that denv-vlp could be successfully expressed in pichia pastoris, based on co-expression of prm and e proteins  <cit> . in that study, it was shown that vaccination with denv-vlp efficiently elicited virus-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in balb/c mice. in the current study, the immunogenicity and protective effect of a vaccine made up of four denv-vlp serotypes was evaluated.

the analysis of humoral immune responses revealed that each of the four dengue vlp serotypes induced antigen specific igg, similar to the corresponding inactivated dengue virions. the antibody levels were higher in denv <dig> and 2-vlp vaccinated groups than in the denv <dig> and 4-vlp groups and in the tetravalent vlp vaccinated group than in monovalent groups. indirect immunofluorescence assay results showed that the antisera from the dengue vlp vaccinated groups could bind with natural dengue virus antigen. in addition, cross-reactions were found between the immune sera from the four denv-vlp serotypes and the natural denv virions . the results suggest that joint immunization with polyvalent antigens may have a synergistic effect in stimulation of the antibody production.

vlps not only induce antibody production, but they also have the ability to induce cellular immunity  <cit> . in the present study, cellular immune responses were assessed by the ability of vlps-stimulated spleen cells to release ifn-γ, tnf-α, and il- <dig> cytokines. the number of tnf-α and il- <dig> secreting splenocytes was significantly higher in mice that received tetravalent denv-vlp compared to pbs controls. however, neither ifn-γ nor tnf-α secreting splenocytes were significantly higher in the monovalent denv-vlp groups . ifn-γ is a type of th <dig> cytokine, that has an anti-viral effect and also enhances tnf-α production by denv-infected cells. in addition, high systemic levels of tnf-α have been shown to cause capillary leakage  <cit> . serum levels of tnf-α and its receptors have been shown to be elevated in denv infection and to correlate with denv disease severity  <cit> . in particular, it has been suggested that il- <dig>  a th <dig> cytokine, to suppress type i ifn-mediated antiviral activity  <cit> . in addition to the above three cytokines, many other cytokine/chemokines are considered to be correlated with dengue disease severity, including il- <dig> β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ifn-γ, tnf-α, and mcp <dig>  <cit> . results of the current study are not enough to evaluate th <dig> or th <dig> immune responses produced by tetravalent denv-vlp or the corresponding dynamic variation. further studies of t-cell responses are needed to understand the immune status of mice immunized with the tetravalent denv-vlp.

the protective efficacy of tetravalent denv-vlp was demonstrated with an antibody neutralization assay in vitro and in suckling mice in vivo. prnt <dig> results showed that immunization with either monovalent or tetravalent denv-vlp induced neutralization antibodies against dengue virus. the prnt <dig> titers from immune sera of mice immunized with denv <dig> and 2-vlp were higher than titers from immune sera of mice immunized with denv <dig> and 4-vlp; however, these titers were all higher than immune sera titers reported after immunization with the tandem denv1- <dig> domain iii of the e protein  <cit>  and higher than the denv1- <dig> vlp level expressed in 293 t cell immune sera  <cit> . the denv-vlp in the present study showed good immunogenicity and neutralization efficacy, though there are still some differences in efficacy among the four denv serotypes. the prnt <dig> titers of immune sera from mice immunized with tetravalent denv-vlp were a little lower than those from mice immunized with the corresponding monovalent denv-vlp. since the antibody levels detected by elisa and ifa were also higher in the tetravalent vlp group than in the monovalent groups, we deduced that there was no significant relationship between antibody level and neutralization efficacy, particularly since more non-neutralizing antibody against a certain dengue serotype might exist in the tetravalent denv-vlp immune sera.

the protective efficacy of the tetravalent denv-vlp vaccine candidate was further tested in a suckling mouse model. the results showed that immunization with either monovalent or tetravalent denv1- <dig> vlps conferred at least some protection, in suckling mice, against denv1- <dig> challenge. furthermore, although the neutralizing antibody level detected was a little lower in the tetravalent formula of denv1- <dig> vlp in vitro, the tetravalent formula provided more protective efficacy in vivo than did the monovalent vaccination. this suggests that the in vivo immune response is more complex, and that in vivo protective efficacy might be dependent on various immunologic mechanisms and not just the neutralizing antibody. moreover, the tetravalent formula had better protective efficacy against denv <dig> and  <dig> compared to denv <dig> or  <dig>  suggesting that further study of the compatibility of tetravalent denv1- <dig> vlp is needed.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the construction of a tetravalent denv1- <dig> vlp vaccine candidate, based on pichia pastoris, is described. the tetravalent denv-vlp induced humoral immune responses against all four dengue virus serotypes as measured by elisa or ifa and also induced cellular immunity. the antibody levels were higher, though the neutralizing titers were somewhat lower with tetravalent than with monovalent immunization. moreover, protective efficacy in the suckling mouse model was better with the tetravalent than with the monovalent vaccination. further study is needed to adjust the compatibility of the tetravalent denv1- <dig> vlp formula and to clarify the amount of cellular immunity that is induced.
