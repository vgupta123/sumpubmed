BACKGROUND
strawberry is the familiar name of a valuable genus  comprising cultivated plants that produce popular and nutritious fruits, as well as wild plant species that populate many areas of the northern hemisphere and south america. the genus contains a diversity of species representing ploidy levels from diploid to decaploid  <cit> . the octoploid  genome composition of the cultivated strawberry, fragaria × ananassa, places this hybrid species among the most genetically complex crop plants. paradoxically, the ~ <dig> mbp size of the basic  strawberry genome  <cit>  ranks among the lowest of crop plant c values. the discordance between small basic genome size and wide ranging genomic complexities makes fragaria a unique system in which to study the effects of reticulate evolution, polyploidization, domestication, and breeding on genes and genomes.

while the cultivated strawberry's genome is complex, extant diploid species provide the opportunity to analyze simpler yet relevant genomes as appropriate comparators to the cultivated octoploids. the widely distributed diploid  species fragaria vesca has been implicated as an ancestral subgenome donor to the octoploid strawberries: f. ×ananassa and its immediate ancestors f. chiloensis and f. virginiana  <cit> . thus, f. vesca provides an outstanding system for addressing genetic and genomic questions relevant to the octoploid strawberries, as well as to the entire rosaceae family  <cit> . existing genomics resources for f. vesca include mapping populations and linkage maps  <cit> , an efficient genetic transformation system for reverse genetics  <cit> , growing est support  <cit> , and forthcoming whole-genome sequence information  <cit> .

large scale projects aimed at sequencing the complete genomes of many crop and model plant species have been preceded by smaller scale efforts that informatively sample and annotate limited but representative genomic regions. examples include the sequencing of: an initial  <dig>  mb contig from arabidopsis thaliana chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , constituting about  <dig> % of the  <dig> mbp arabidopsis genome; six bac clones, comprising  <dig> kb or  <dig> % of the  <dig> mbp tomato genome  <cit> ; and bac ends that generated  <dig> mb of sequence or  <dig> % of the  <dig> mbp papaya genome  <cit> . detailed analysis and annotation of these genomic sequence samples provided initial insights into genome composition, gene number, and other parameters that could help to guide, or in some cases physically anchor, a subsequent complete genome sequencing project.

in a companion paper  <cit> , we examined a random sampling of  <dig> f. vesca genomic sequence segments comprising ~ <dig>  mb, or ~ <dig> % of the f. vesca genome. the key resource for that and the present study was a fosmid library from f. vesca; constructed from physically sheared and blunt-end cloned genomic dna fragments from f. vesca ssp. americana 'pawtuckaway'  <cit> . on the basis of that representative genomic sampling, we concluded that the f. vesca genome contains about  <dig>  protein-encoding genes, plus >  <dig> truncated gene fragments. over  <dig> new repeat families were identified, the most common of which were long terminal repeat  retrotransposons. total transposable element  content of the f. vesca ssp. americana genome was estimated to be at least 16%.

in the present study, our aim was to examine a specific set of genomic sequences and gene neighborhoods, targeted for study because they contain genes of likely relevance to horticultural and fruit quality traits, with emphasis on metabolic pathways, flowering-related genes, and disease resistance-related genes. the alcohol dehydrogenase  was targeted on the basis of its use in ongoing phylogenetic studies in fragaria  <cit> , and for its historical status as the first protein-encoding gene to be sequenced in strawberry  <cit> . the granule-bound starch synthase i  gene was also of interest relevant to its use in phylogenetic studies of fragaria  <cit>  and the rosaceae  <cit> .

our approach necessarily differed from that of the previous study  <cit> , because our focus was on the features of specifically targeted genomic sites rather than on representative genomic sampling. we herein present a detailed description of  <dig> genomic regions comprising  <dig>  mb of dna sequence. this description encompasses the identification and annotation of putative genes, pseudogenes, and repetitive elements. it is expected that the results reported herein will be of particular value to plant biologists interested in the studied genes and the traits to which they may relate, and to molecular breeders pursuing the genetic improvement of strawberry and/or other members of the rosaceae family.

RESULTS
fosmid library
the ctab isolation procedure produced genomic dna fragments in the  <dig> kb size range, evidently a consequence of random, procedure-induced physical shearing. following end-repair, this genomic dna was used in a single ligation reaction to construct the fosmid library, which consisted of  <dig>  clones arrayed in eighty-seven 384-well plates and spotted in ordered pairs onto multiply replicated sets of two high-density filters.

filter hybridizations
of twenty protein-encoding gene probes used in filter hybridizations, eighteen probes yielded at least one pcr-confirmed target clone. one fosmid clone was selected for each of sixteen probes, while two fosmid clones with distinctly differing restriction fragment patterns were selected for sequencing from each of two probes: grga <dig> and tps. thus, a total of  <dig> protein-encoding gene probes were used to select  <dig> fosmids  to be subcloned and sequenced.

genbank
fosmid insert sequences
uninterrupted insert sequences bounded by vector ends were obtained from  <dig> of  <dig> fosmid clones. these insert contigs ranged in length from  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  bp . of the remaining  <dig> clones, sequence assembly generated two  or three  ordered contigs . for the  <dig> multi-contig clones, the sum of contig sequence lengths varied from  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  bp. the total length of insert sequence generated from the  <dig> selected fosmids was  <dig>  bp, or an average of  <dig>  bp per insert. these sequences have been deposited into genbank under the accession numbers listed in table  <dig> 

identification of genetic elements
as detailed below, several categories of genetic elements were identified, including protein-encoding genes and pseudogenes, expressed sequences, transposable elements , and other repetitive elements including simple sequence repeats . the results of the bioinformatic analyses are presented in two forms: tabular  and graphical . figure  <dig> provides a key to the icons, abbreviations, and other conventions employed in the subsequent "fosmid figures".

1fgenesh predictions were classified as unsupported if no gene was detected at the indicated location via blast homology searches.

2the term "gene merger" refers to instances in which two or more gene sites identified on the basis of blast homology were merged into a single fgenesh gene prediction. the term "genes merged" refers to the cumulative number of genes involved in such gene mergers.

3fgenesh predictions of start and stop codons were considered to be validated if support for their predicted locations was obtained from examination of orfs in homologous sequences identified by blast homology searches.

each fosmid figure consists of five parts . part a depicts the ab initio predictions of the six fgenesh training models. part b depicts the output of blastx homology searches of the ncbi protein database, delimited to arabidopsis or viridiplantae. part c depicts the output of blastn homology searches of the ncbi est-others database, delimited to the rosaceae family. fragaria est matches are boxed. part d provides a graphic representation of the annotated features of the respective fosmid insert, wherein each icon-coded gene site is coupled to its supporting evidence and fgenesh predictions  by a vertical, gray stripe. part e depicts the locations, sequence motifs, and repeat numbers of ssr loci. finally, each fosmid figure is accompanied by an abbreviated spreadsheet that provides information about the annotated gene sites, including strand assignments, putative start and stop codon sites, and putative gene product identity. a more detailed listing of the homology-based evidence supporting each gene site identification is provided in additional file 1: fosmid gene content annotation.

ab initio predictions 
the number of predicted protein-encoding genes varied considerably among the six fgenesh models , ranging from a low of  <dig>  to a high of  <dig> , with an overall mean of  <dig> . as detailed below, the subsequent generation of a set of homology-based inferences provided a basis for comparison with the outputs of the six ab initio models.

blastx homology 
blastx searches of the ncbi arabidopsis and viridiplantae protein databases, employing the fosmid inserts as query sequences, were used to identify protein-encoding gene sites, including intact genes, pseudogenes, and te-related proteins. using a conservative cutoff of e = 10- <dig>  <cit> , a total of  <dig> gene sites were identified, while a less conservative cutoff of e = 10- <dig> yielded eight additional gene sites. with reference to their best blastx matches,  <dig> gene sites encoded te-related proteins ,  <dig> encoded proteins with tentative or definitive functional identities, and  <dig> encoded "unknown proteins". the inferred strand assignments of each of these  <dig> genes sites are provided in the fosmid figures and in additional file 1: fosmid gene content annotation, column c.

blastn homology to fragaria and rosaceae ests 
in total, blastn searches of the ncbi rosaceae est database  recovered  <dig> "top-tier"  est matches, of which  <dig> were from fragaria   and two were from rosa. top-tier f-est coverage varied considerably among the  <dig> blastx-inferred gene sites. fifty-five gene sites had one or more top-tier f-est matches, while  <dig> had none. fifteen genes sites had complete est coverage , providing a basis for establishing gene models, as addressed below. numerous "second-tier"  ests from fragaria and other rosaceous species  occurred at many of the identified gene sites , and elsewhere within the fosmid sequences. the second tier f-ests were denoted by rounded boxes in the fosmid figures.

several top-tier f-est matches occurred at genomic sites that lacked blastx matches and fgenesh predictions. six such gene sites occurred at fosmid insert boundaries, where the match comprised a 5' or 3' utr sequence but little or no coding sequence. in the absence of recognizable coding sequence within the fosmid boundaries, these putative gene sites were invisible to fgenesh and blastx. additionally, two f-est sites that lacked blastx matches and fgenesh predictions occurred internally in the inserts. gene site  <dig> in fosmid 08g <dig>  was defined by f-ests , and gene site  <dig> in fosmid 52b <dig>  was also defined by an f-est . these f-ests lacked obvious orfs, and blastx searches using the ests themselves as queries obtained no quality matches. thus, the f-ests in question may be non-coding, or may encode previously undescribed proteins.

comparison of ab initio predictions and homology-based inferences
homology-based inferences of gene site numbers and locations and of start and stop codon positions provided a basis for evaluating the differing outputs of the six fgenesh ab initio models. as previously noted, the number of predicted genes varied considerably among ab initio models . as compared with the number of  <dig> blastx inferred gene sites, the mo  and vv  models under-predicted, while the remaining models over-predicted the number of protein-encoding genetic elements.

under-prediction was primarily due to "gene merging": the prediction of one large gene over a region wherein two or more separate genes were detected by homology search . the vv model generated a high of  <dig> such "gene mergers", involving a total of  <dig> blastx-inferred genes, while the nt model generated only  <dig> gene mergers, involving  <dig> blastx-inferred genes . over-prediction was primarily due to absence of homology-based evidence of gene location at some sites of ab initio prediction. the number of non-validated ab initio predictions ranged from a high of  <dig>  to a low of  <dig>  .

for each of the blastx-identified genes, start and stop codon positions were inferred on the basis of homology searches supplemented by manual examination of reading frames as displayed by seqbuilder , utilizing comparisons to f-ests wherever possible. this homology-based analysis established the putative locations of  <dig> start and  <dig> stop codons.

the discrepancy between the homology based inference of  <dig> gene sites and the substantially lesser numbers of inferred start and stop codon locations was attributable to several factors. nineteen of the  <dig> gene sites were artifactually truncated at their 5' or 3' ends, either by a fosmid end or by a contig gap. because no contig gaps interrupted genes of specific interest, effort was not invested in closing these gaps, with the expectation that they soon will be closed by the anticipated whole genome sequencing of fragaria vesca. another obstacle was "biological truncation"  <cit> , in which a terminal segment of a coding region is missing due to deletion or rearrangement. as many as  <dig> of the identified gene sites appeared to be truncated pseudogenes, as evidenced by substantial shortening of the predicted protein as compared with its putative arabidopsis homolog. of the  <dig> te-related gene sites, only one start codon and two stop codons could be identified. lack of est support also precluded establishment of start and/or stop codon positions in many genes.

when the homology-inferred  <dig> start and  <dig> stop codon locations were compared to those predicted for the respective genes by the fgenesh models , the highest number of start and stop codon agreements were, respectively,  <dig>  and  <dig> . the lowest numbers, respectively, were  <dig>  and  <dig> . among the six fgenesh models, the closest overall agreement with our homology-based inferences of start and stop codon positions was provided by the mt model, with the at model a close second best .

gene models
using the geneseqer program, intron locations were determined in each of the  <dig> genes for which complete coding sequence  est coverage was available. this information, in combination with previously detailed determinations of start and stop codon locations, provided a basis for defining gene models . among the  <dig> modeled genes, intron number ranged from zero to nine per gene, with a mean of  <dig> . the intron size range, from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp, approximated a poisson distribution, with  <dig> of  <dig> introns falling below  <dig> bp in length and  <dig> falling below the mean intron size of  <dig> bp .

targeted genes
a central objective of this project was to obtain the complete genomic sequences of a suite of targeted genes that were of potentially broad interest to the fragaria/rosaceae research community and industry. each fosmid clone contained a gene site that clearly corresponded, with ≥ 98% nucleotide sequence identity, to its respective hybridization probe. each of the targeted genes was contained entirely within the respective fosmid boundaries, providing knowledge of promoter and other flanking regulatory sequences. noteworthy features of these targeted genes are described below, with the expectation that they will be the subjects of intensive follow-up studies.

anthocyanin-pathway-related genes
chalcone synthase 
two adjacent copies of the chs gene are present in head-to-tail orientation on minus strand of fosmid 73i <dig> . for purposes of discussion only, we provisionally designate the downstream and upstream gene copies as chs- <dig> and chs- <dig>  respectively. six f-ests were identified that provide top-tier matches to one or both of these gene copies. three f-ests best match chs- <dig>  and three best match chs- <dig>  uniquely providing full f-est coverage to each gene copy. the resulting gene models, each displaying the presence of one intron, are provided in additional file 2: gene models. a comparison of chs- <dig> and chs- <dig> coding sequences showed them to have 95% nucleotide sequence identity and 98% predicted amino acid sequence identity. in contrast, the nucleotide sequences of the single intron of each gene shared only 55% identity.

chalcone isomerase 
fosmid 48i <dig>  contains a single chi gene . two top-tier f-ests provide complete coding sequence coverage, with the resulting gene model displaying the presence of three introns .

dihydroflavonol 4-reductase 
fosmid 53o <dig>  contains a single dfr gene. four top-tier f-ests provide complete cds coverage, with the resulting gene model displaying the presence of five introns .

regulator of anthocyanin synthesis 
fosmid 76c <dig>  was selected by a probe targeted to a del-like regulatory gene designated as ran in strawberry  <cit> . the probe sequence has 98% nucleotide identity to a region of gene site  <dig> on the same fosmid. in taxon-delimited blastx searches, this gene site had the following best protein matches: gl <dig>  and transcription factor  ; and myc-like anthocyanin regulatory protein . one top-tier f-est match provides partial est coverage for this gene.

other metabolism-related genes
alcohol dehydrogenase 
two adjacent copies of the targeted adh gene are present in head-to-head orientation on fosmid 14k <dig> . the gene copy on the plus strand  corresponds to the originally sequenced adh gene from f. ×ananassa  <cit> , in recognition of which we designate it adh- <dig>  this gene copy had no f-est support. the gene copy on the minus strand , which we designate adh- <dig>  had four matching f-ests, providing full coding sequence coverage. the resulting gene model is provided in additional file 2: gene models. there is 85% identity between the inferred amino acid sequence of adh- <dig>  and the previously defined amino acid sequence of adh- <dig>  <cit> , while the coding sequences of these two genes have 77% nucleotide identity. both adh- <dig> and adh- <dig> have nine introns, and between the two genes the corresponding intron sequences are so divergent as to preclude meaningful alignment.

granule-bound starch synthase-i 
fosmid 52i <dig>  contains a single gbssi gene . of the two gbssi genes known in fragaria , this is gbssi- <dig>  three top-tier f-ests provide est coverage of this gene's 5' and 3' ends.

terpene synthase 
two fosmids with differing restriction digestion patterns were selected by their hybridization to the tps probe. fosmid 41o <dig>  contains two tps genes , while fosmid 53j <dig>  contains one tps gene . none of the three identified tps genes have top-tier f-est matches. a single fragaria est blastn match , has only 94% nucleotide sequence identity to each of the three identified tps genes, suggesting that this est may be the transcript of an additional tps gene in the fragaria genome. intriguingly, each tps gene has as its immediate downstream neighbor a pentatricopeptide  gene, in tail-to-tail orientation. in fosmid 40i <dig> the 5' ends of both ppr genes appear to be truncated, while the ppr gene in fosmid 53j <dig> appears to have a full length coding sequence.

flowering-related genes
pistillata 
two adjacent copies of the pistillata gene were present in head-to-tail orientation on the minus strand of fosmid 76k <dig> . the gene copy at site  <dig>  which we designate as pistillata- <dig>  had two matching top-tier f-ests, providing full coding sequence coverage. the pistillata- <dig> gene model, which contains six introns, is presented in additional file 2: gene models. the gene copy at site  <dig>  designated pistillata- <dig>  had no matching f-ests. a partial fragaria homolog of the arabidopsis efs  gene resides at gene site  <dig>  thus, fosmid 76k <dig> captures members of a multi-gene cluster that may play a complex role in the regulation of flowering in fragaria. notably, in arabidopsis the pistillata gene is not tandemly duplicated, and it resides at a locus  unlinked to that of the efs gene .

leafy 
fosmid 10b <dig>  contains a single copy of the leafy gene . this gene had no top-tier f-est matches, or any high percentage est matches in any rosaceae species.

apetala <dig> 
fosmid 08g <dig>  contains a single copy of the ap <dig> gene . this gene had no top-tier f-est matches.

phytochrome a 
fosmid 51f <dig>  contains a single copy of the phya gene . this gene had no top-tier f-est matches.

elongated hypocotyl  <dig> 
fosmid 01i <dig>  contains a single copy of the hy <dig> gene . three top-tier f-ests provide complete cds coverage. the hy <dig> gene model, which contains two introns, is presented in additional file 2: gene models.

constans 
fosmid 52b <dig>  contains a single copy of a targeted gene  that has the col- <dig>  protein as its best arabidopsis blastx match. four top-tier f-ests provide complete coding sequence coverage. the respective gene model, which contains one intron, is presented in additional file 2: gene models.

suppressor of constans overexpression 
in fosmid 19h <dig> , the probe hybridization was to gene site  <dig>  which has the arabidopsis agl <dig>  suppressor of constans overexpression  <dig> protein as its best arabidopsis blastx match. this gene has one top-tier f-est match that provides partial coding sequence coverage, but not of the 5' end, thus leaving the start codon site undetermined. also on fosmid 19h <dig>  gene sites  <dig> and  <dig> both have best blastx homology to the arabidopsis agl <dig>  gene, but appear to be truncated at their 3' ends and have no top-tier f-est matches. yet interestingly, a fragaria vesca soc  <dig> protein sequence  identified by blastx search, has very high homology at its c terminal end to gene site  <dig>  and at its n terminal end to gene sites  <dig> and  <dig>  thus, gene site  <dig> and/or and  <dig> may actually constitute the 5' end of the f. vesca soc gene - a hypothesis that will attract further investigation.

nbs-lrr disease resistance-like genes
crga1
fosmid 34e <dig>  contains a cluster of nbs-lrr disease resistance-like genes. three of these are apparently full length nbs-lrr resistance-like genes , each of which has strong blastx homology to the protein products of both members of a tandemly duplicated pair of arabidopsis loci: at5g <dig> and at5g <dig>  additionally, gene site  <dig> is an apparently truncated resistance-like gene. two f-ests provide top-tier matches to the internal region of gene site  <dig>  while two other f-ests  provide top-tier matches to the 5' and 3' ends of gene site  <dig>  providing evidence that these two genes are transcribed.

grga1
fosmid 19m <dig>  contains a pair of nbs-lrr disease resistance-like genes . both have among their top blastx matches an arabidopsis nbs-lrr resistance-like protein encoded by locus at4g <dig>  one f-est provides a top-tier match to the 3' end of gene site  <dig> 

grga2
two fosmids with differing restriction digestion patterns were selected by their hybridization to the genomic grga <dig> probe. in fosmid 13i <dig> , the probe target is gene site  <dig>  this gene has one marginally top-tier f-est match  that provides coverage mostly of the 3' utr. in fosmid 32l <dig> , the probe target is gene site  <dig>  which has one top-tier f-est match. the indicated gene sites on both fosmids show sequence similarity to nbs-lrr resistance-like proteins encoded by both members of tandemly duplicated arabidopsis loci at3g <dig> and at3g <dig> 

lrr disease resistance-like gene
glrr
fosmid 49m <dig>  was selected by its hybridization to the probe glrr at gene site 4a. this gene site had as its best blastx match a disease resistance family protein encoded by arabidopsis locus at2g <dig>  and had no top-tier f-est matches. the 3' structure of this gene is ambiguous, with evidence from a malus  cdna sequence suggesting that this gene may be transcriptionally merged with the neighboring squalene epoxidase-like gene .

micro-colinearity with arabidopsis
by cross-referencing arabidopsis proteins identified by blastx to their respective physical map positions, instances of microcolinearity or conserved microsynteny with arabidopsis thaliana were identified in twelve fosmids, involving a total of  <dig> putative fragaria genes . as an example of microcolinearity in fosmid 08g <dig> , fragaria genes  <dig> and  <dig> are homologous to arabidopsis loci at3g <dig> and at3g <dig>  as examples of interrupted colinearity but conserved microsynteny, fragaria genes  <dig> and  <dig> in fosmid 76k <dig>  are homologous to arabidopsis loci at1g <dig> and at1g <dig>  while fragaria genes  <dig> and  <dig> in fosmid 10b <dig>  are homologous to arabidopsis loci at1g <dig> and at1g <dig> 

transposable-element-related sequences
two full length copia-type ltr retrotransposons were identified: one on fosmid 14k <dig>  and one on fosmid 19m <dig> . single mutator-like elements were identified on fosmids 10b <dig>  and 52b <dig> . gene sites  <dig> and  <dig> on fosmids 73i <dig>  and 76c <dig> , respectively, encoded putative reverse transcriptase-related proteins, while gene sites  <dig> and  <dig> on fosmids 14k <dig>  and 49m <dig> , respectively, encoded transposase-like proteins. blastx searches detected retroviral polyprotein-like sequences on fosmids 08g <dig> , 19h <dig> , 53j <dig> , and 53o <dig> .

ssr content
any uninterrupted tract of five or more identical repeat units  was counted as an ssr by the ssrit analysis. part e of each fosmid figure depicts the locations, motif sequences, and repeat lengths of these ssr sites. the number of ssr sites per fosmid insert varied from zero  to  <dig> . the total number of qualifying ssrs found in the  <dig> targeted fosmid inserts was  <dig>  giving an average ssr distribution of ~ <dig> per  <dig>  kb . there were  <dig> di-nucleotide repeat ssrs and  <dig> tri-nucleotide repeats, and no tetra- or penta- nucleotide repeats. of ssrs with repeat numbers of  <dig> or more, two were at  repeats and  <dig> were ag  repeats. the eight longest ssr tracts were all ag repeats, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> repeats. among tri-nucleotide repeat types, aag  repeats were by far the most common. the numbers/frequencies of the various ssr repeat types are summarized in table  <dig> 

discussion
our evaluation of targeted gene space in the strawberry diploid species, fragaria vesca, unveils new knowledge about  <dig> important genomic neighborhoods: information that can guide a diversity of gene- or trait-specific investigations, and facilitate site-specific molecular marker development. moreover, the cumulative generation of over  <dig>  mb of genomic sequence by the present investigation of  <dig> gene-targeted sites and its companion study of  <dig> randomly selected sites  <cit> , provides an invaluable baseline of robustly assembled and carefully annotated sanger sequence data to which future next generation data sets and high throughput bioinformatic analyses can be compared and assessed. we anticipate that the experience gained through this effort will contribute valuable perspective, precedent, and impetus to whole genome sequencing efforts in fragaria.

although our assessment of gene content ultimately relied on homology-based methods, ab initio predictions provided an illuminating framework within which to organize and interpret homology-based determinations. in undertaking a comparison of the six higher plant ab initio training models  accessible on softberry's fgenesh website  <cit> , we hypothesized that the taxa most closely related phylogenetically to fragaria would provide the best training models for our analysis. according to the most recent release of the angiosperm phylogeny group  <cit> , the ordered phylogenetic distances of the six training model taxa from fragaria  are  medicago  <arabidopsis  <vitis  <nicotiana and lycopersicon  < monocots. by one measure, the "accurate" prediction of start and stop codons, the medicago  model was marginally better than the arabidopsis  model, and both of these surpassed the remaining four predictive models. it would be of considerable interest to know whether and to what extent an fgenesh model trained on rosaceae sequence data would outperform the mt and at models for predictive analysis of fragaria sequence; however, such a model was not available for the present study.

our analysis indicated that the six fgenesh models were variably prone to over-prediction, under-prediction, gene-merging, and/or gene-splitting. however, with knowledge of these tendencies in hand, the overall perspective provided by comparisons among these disparate models provided a useful backdrop to the interpretation of homology-based analyses, helping to draw attention to structural anomalies worthy of further exploration. on balance, our experience suggests that integrated consideration of all six fgenesh model outputs provided maximal insight into the genetic content of the studied fragaria sequences. as easily visualized by viewing a broad sampling of the fosmid figures, the fgenesh models were in substantial agreement in some genomic regions, but at considerable variance in others. yet such disagreements are themselves informative, potentially drawing attention to sites of unconventional functionality.

gene content
the genomic frequency of gene sites identified in our study of  <dig> gene-targeted fosmid clones is similar to that found in  <dig> randomly selected clones from the same genomic library  <cit> . discounting  <dig> te-related gene sites, the present study identified  <dig> protein encoding genes and pseudogenes within a total of ~ <dig> kb, or an average of one gene site per  <dig>  kb. similarly, the companion study identified  <dig> gene sites in  <dig>  kb, or one gene per  <dig>  kb  <cit> . that an intentional focus on gene-rich, as opposed to randomly selected, genomic sites yielded similar protein-encoding gene densities is consistent with the finding that te and other repetitive sequence content in the f. vesca genome is quite low  <cit> , and that most of this genome is, in fact, gene rich.

a surprising finding in the present study was the number of targeted genes, as well as non-targeted genes, that were tandemly duplicated. full length tandem gene duplications of targeted genes were seen in fosmids 14k <dig> , 73i <dig> , 41o <dig> , 76k <dig> , 19m <dig> , and 34e <dig> . tandem or near-tandem duplications of genes or gene fragments not targeted by probes were also seen. such duplications involved apparently truncated pseudogenes on fosmids 13i <dig> , 32l <dig> , and 41o <dig> . on fosmid 08g <dig>  two apparently full-length copies of a small basic intrinsic protein gene flanked a retroelement-like sequence. although the clustering and neighboring duplication of disease resistance-like genes is a well-known phenomenon in plants  <cit> , it is noteworthy that, excluding the resistance-like genes, none of the homologues to the tandemly duplicated fragaria genes enumerated above were themselves tandemly duplicated in arabidopsis.

est support varied with respect to the members of tandem gene duplicates. substantial est support existed for both chs copies. in contrast, est support was lacking for adh- <dig>  but was sufficient to allow definition of a gene model for adh- <dig>  only one of the two pistillata copies had top-tier est support. similarly, only one of the two tandemly duplicated nbs-llr resistance-like genes on fosmid 19m <dig> had any top-tier est support, while no such est support existed for either tps copy on fosmid 41o <dig> or for the single copy on fosmid 53j <dig>  the absence of est support for one or both members of a tandemly duplicated gene pair might be the consequence of differential expression patterns, or might simply be attributable to sampling bias in the existing fragaria est database, wherein most of the currently available sequences are from whole seedlings of fragaria vesca subjected to a handful of stressors. alternately, absence of est support might be indicative of mutational gene silencing, which is one of several possible evolutionary fates of duplicated genes  <cit> . resolution of these possibilities awaits the much needed expansion of the fragaria est database to include a comprehensive diversity of tissue types, and representation of influence by a broad spectrum of environmental variables.

targeted genes
the complete elucidation of candidate gene sequences from strawberry opens many opportunities to now test functional predictions as they relate to plant productivity. clearly the information identified from analysis of leafy, soc, phya, hy <dig> and co all may present a means to now translate information about flowering from arabidopsis and other species to strawberry. strawberry species exhibit a wide range of photoperiodic behaviors. these are of intense interest to breeders as photoperiod sensitivity strongly dictates the utility of a given cultivar.

anthocyanin pigmentation is an important aspect of fruit color and quality, but also can be a factor in stress resistance and other physiological functions and environmental interactions throughout the plant  <cit> . the identified chs, chi, dfr, and ran genes are likely to be factors in many aspects of anthocyanin pigment composition and spatiotemporal distribution. along with the anthocyanin pathway gene products, terpene synthases play a demonstrated role in flavor and fragrance as aspects for fruit quality, also making them of interest to strawberry breeders.

two other metabolic genes, adh and gbssi, were of interest because of their widespread usage in plants  <cit> , and their specific recent usage in fragaria  <cit> , for phylogenetic analysis. the finding that the adh gene is tandemly duplicated in f. vesca, and the differential est support for its two gene copies, further extends the potential interest in adh as a focal point for comparative evolutionary studies in fragaria. the gbssi gene sequence described herein is that of gbssi- <dig>  as distinct from the gbssi- <dig> gene used in the phylogenetic analysis of fragaria by rousseau-gueutin et al.  <cit> . the presence of at least two copies of the gbssi gene is a general feature of the rosaceae family  <cit> .

disease resistance genes are of central interest to plant breeders. conserved segments of nbs-lrr resistance-like genes have been isolated from genomic dna in many plant species, including strawberry  <cit> , using degenerate primers targeted to conserved sites  <cit> . the nbs-lrr and lrr resistance-like gene sequences we present here are the first complete genomic disease-resistance like gene sequences to be reported in strawberry.

as the number of sequenced genomes grows, various studies have examined gene arrangement between sequenced genomes in the interest of inferring evolutionary relationships. one recent study defined microsyntenic relationships by examining colinearity of prunus , populus, medicago and arabidopsis. a positive relationship was defined as a distance not less than  <dig> kb that contained four gene pairs  <cit> . comparisons using this approach relating prunus and arabidopsis genomes indicated that microsynteny is not well-conserved between these species. in the present study gene-pair relationships were examined between the genes ordered in the fosmids and the known gene order in arabidopsis. not surprisingly, similar results were obtained to those in the prunus-arabidopsis comparisons. the data in table  <dig> indicate that out of the set of  <dig> fosmid clones, only nine shared evidence of potential gene-pair relationships with arabidopsis.

the data agree well with the conclusions of jung et al.  <cit> . there are some clear special cases that should be considered carefully. the two adjacent genes on fosmid 34e <dig> are nbs-lrr genes. these are typically found as proximally located members of a multigene family, so it is not surprising that these would be detected as colinear in these analyses. two fosmids contain strawberry terpene synthase genes, where arabidopsis only has one. in both cases an immediate neighbor is an arabidopsis gene, yet a gene found on different linkage groups. this finding indicates the possibility that the terpene synthase gene may have been a site for duplication in strawberry relative to a common ancestor, or perhaps a site of duplication within strawberry.

est support and coverage
the genomic sequence analyzed provides a means to test gene prediction against actual gene-coding sequence, best estimated by analysis of est relationships. of the total predicted genes on all fosmids, approximately half  maintain >85% identity with an est in the viridiplantae database. when compared against ests from the rosaceae even fewer matches were obtained, and those were typically from malus, rosa and prunus where significant est resources exist. of all of the sequences featuring est cognates, only fourteen genes have sufficient est support to provide complete delineation of exon/intron boundaries as a basis for gene modeling, while  <dig> gene sites had no top-tier fragaria est support. exemplifying the latter case, support was lacking for fosmid 08g <dig> gene  <dig>  and fosmid 10b <dig> gene  <dig> . the first is annotated only as an embryo defective transcript and the second is leafy. both of these are examples where transcripts may be expected to be found in specialized tissues and/or developmental contexts. therefore, it is not surprising that representative cdna sequences do not appear in the public databases, wherein over 90% of sequences represent seedling transcripts in response to abiotic stress.

taken together, these findings indicate the need for more fragaria est coverage, especially from specific tissues and developmental states. est coverage from other diploid species, such as fragaria iinumae, will be helpful in the development of subgenome-specific markers in the cultivated strawberry fragaria ×ananassa. the reciprocal condition also exists, where fosmid-based sequences have est coverage, but it is either confined to the rosaceae  or possibly strawberry specific . these uncharacterized expressed sequences are abundant in est collections but were not identified in this study.

ssr loci
the identification of ssr loci for use as potential molecular markers for linkage mapping, marker assisted selection, and diversity studies has received considerable attention in fragaria  <cit> . a total of  <dig> ssrs of five or more homogeneous repeat tracts were identified. of the di-nucleotide repeat motif types, ag and at were by far the most common, as has also been reported in species as diverse as arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . among tri-nucleotide repeat types, aag was the most common, eclipsing the frequency of any other tri-nucleotide type by a factor of at least  <dig> . aag is also the most common tri-nucleotide repeat motif in arabidopsis, while ccg is the most common type in rice  <cit> .

the utilized ssrit program counts only uninterrupted repeat tracts as ssrs. thus, a continuous sequence such as 6tct <dig>  would be counted as two ssrs by ssrit because the two tcc tracts are interrupted by a tct. from the perspective of pcr primer pair design for ssr marker genotyping, this and several other instances of close-proximity ssr tracts would have to be treated as a single ssr locus, amplified by a single primer pair. thus, the total number of operationally defined ssr loci detected in the fosmid inserts is somewhat less than the total number of  <dig> counted ssrs. if any pair of ssr tracts separated by less than  <dig> bp is counted as constituting a single operational ssr locus for purposes of molecular marker development, there are  <dig> discrete ssr loci, with a frequency of  <dig> ssr locus per  <dig>  kb, or about  <dig> ssr loci per mb.

the current f. vesca linkage map  <cit>  has a total length of  <dig> cm. given the  <dig> mb size of the f. vesca genome, there is an average ratio of  <dig> kb/cm. extrapolating from these data, ssr loci are distributed in the f. vesca genome with a density of about  <dig> ssr loci per  <dig> cm of map distance, thus indicating that sufficient ssr loci exist to support the construction of ssr-based linkage maps to a resolution of well under  <dig> cm.

repetitive elements
in this study, thirteen te-related elements were detected on the basis of blastx homology and structural analysis. a thorough analysis of te-related and other repetitive element content in  <dig> random sequence samples comprising ~ <dig> mbp in f. vesca was presented in the companion study  <cit> , while ma et al.  <cit>  reported the isolation of retroelement sequences from fragaria ×ananassa. no top-tier est support was found for any of the te-related sequences identified in the present study or that of ma et al.  <cit> , and no evidence of contemporary te transpositional activity has been reported to date in fragaria.

CONCLUSIONS
characterization of a targeted sampling of gene space in strawberry provides tremendous information that can be used on many levels. first, a comprehensive accounting of genic regions revealed by sanger sequencing will inform and guide high throughput, whole genome sequencing efforts, and serve to anchor short-read sequencing assemblies. the focus on genes with known roles in biological processes relevant to agricultural production allows comparative study of these genes and their nascent transcripts, and development of markers for use in breeding and selection. the results allow contrast with other genomes, spotlighting the surprising tendency for gene duplications in strawberry. the detailed characterization of diploid strawberry gene space also is a reference point that will permit comparisons with other diploid and polyploid fragaria species, further unveiling evolutionary relationships in this economically important genus.
