BACKGROUND
large-scale transcriptional profiling and the availability of the complete genome sequences have made it possible for transcriptome mapping analysis in various organisms  <cit> . transcriptome maps showing the density of expressed genes along the chromosome have revealed genomic regions that correspond to known amplicons of human tumors  <cit> . regional similarity of expression on the chromosome have been observed in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> , nematode caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> , fruit fly drosophila melanogaster <cit> , and human  <cit> . transcriptome maps showing regional similarities illustrate the existence of chromosomal domains of gene coexpression and transcriptional regulation operating at the local chromosome level. transcriptome mapping analyses have been based on data generated from a variety of experimental techniques, including expressed sequence tags  <cit> , serial analysis of gene expression  <cit> , and microarray  <cit> . all of these studies have revealed interesting and novel patterns of transcriptome in relation to genomic organization, molecular evolution, and biological functions.

human embryonic stem  cells have the ability to differentiate into a variety of cell lineages and hold promise for drug discovery, toxicology, and replacement therapies. the embryoid body  is the earliest stage of es differentiation in culture. the transcriptome of human es and eb cells has been studied in detail in recent years  <cit> . these studies have suggested that es cells have an open transcriptome with few cold spots or hot spots of gene expression in the undifferentiated state and a more complex global regulation in the eb stage of differentiation. however, no systematic analysis has yet addressed whether gene expression in human es cells may be regulated in chromosomal domains, and no chromosomal domains of coexpression have been identified. here, we describe the first analysis of coexpression of neighboring genes on the chromosome in es and eb cells. we determined gene expression profiles by beadarray™  <cit>  and constructed transcriptome maps for both es and eb cells. the map showed a significant pattern of gene coexpression on chromosome domains. the coexpression remained significant regardless of the effect of gene duplication. the genomic distribution of coexpression chromosomal domains was found to be non-random, with different coexpression patterns observed in es and eb cells. the coexpression chromosome domains were biological and physiological significant. esc – important molecular functions or biological processes were found to be enriched in the domains. the transcriptome map provided a basis to examine transcriptional regulation operating at the level of chromosomal domains in human es cells and differential coexpression of gene clusters during the es differentiation. the findings of this study advance our understanding of how genome organization affects gene expression and hence the self-renewal or differentiation of es cells.

RESULTS
the overall goal of this study was to elucidate general coexpression patterns at the domain level in es and eb. the coexpression profiling was based on the combination of six different cell lines representing es or eb. each cell line had a single sample, except i <dig> . an additional sample was derived from pooled culture of different cell lines. the six cell lines and their relatedness to each other are illustrated in supplementary table s <dig> . the cell line samples were similar to each other on the expression profiles in es and eb, with a bit higher heterogeneity in eb than es. the gene expression profile of each human es cell line and its eb counterpart were determined using the high-density beadarray™. the array contains  <dig>  probes, representing  <dig>  unique genes. based on the expression data, we calculated the coexpression index for each gene in a sliding window across each chromosome. the coexpression index for a given gene was defined as the average of pearson's correlation coefficient values of gene expression levels between this gene and every neighboring gene upstream and downstream within a certain window. the correlation of between genes was calculated from the expression values in the seven samples of es or eb. the coexpression index, which measures the degree of coexpression among neighboring genes on the chromosome, was used in the subsequent construction and analysis of transcriptome coexpression maps in es and eb cells.

 <dig>  es and eb cells show significant coexpression patterns along the chromosome
in order to statistically examine whether genes are significantly coexpressed on the chromosome, we calculated the mean value of the coexpression index for the entire set of expressed genes on the genome. the mean coexpression index was determined for different window sizes and from two different genomic data sources: a) the real genome, to which the expressed genes were mapped; and b) the randomized genome, which was created by shuffling position indexes of the same number of genes on each chromosome. supplementary fig. s <dig>  presents plots of the mean coexpression index values for both es and eb states. as shown, the mean coexpression index from the real genome data was consistently higher than that from the random genome data across different window sizes in both es and eb. this suggested a significant pattern of coexpression of neighboring genes in both es and eb cells. the plots  further showed that the mean coexpression index decreased greatly when the neighboring gene number increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  beyond  <dig> neighboring genes, the decrease of the coexpression level became less significant, and this continued for domains of up to  <dig> neighboring genes. this finding suggested that clusters of up to  <dig> neighboring genes may be coexpressed on the chromosome. we therefore used the window size of  <dig> genes for subsequent coexpression index analyses in this study.

we next determined the p value of both the coexpression index and mean coexpression index at the window size of  <dig> genes by monte-carlo simulation. coexpression index and mean co-expression index values were calculated from  <dig>  randomized genome data . the derived monte-carlo distributions  allowed determination of the p value for the coexpression index of a given gene or the mean co-expression index of a given set of genes. for the es and eb expression data, the mean coexpression index was  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the p values for both mean co-expression index values were below  <dig>  . the monte-carlo simulation thus provided further evidence that coexpression of neighboring genes was significant in the real genome in es and eb cells.

the coexpression of neighboring genes may be due to duplicated genes, which often remain adjacent and have similar expression patterns  <cit> . to assess the effect of gene duplication on the coexpression index in es and eb, we re-generated randomized genome data sets where all tandem duplication genes  <cit>  were removed, and conducted monte-carlo simulation again. the mean coexpression index values were  <dig>  and  <dig>  in es and eb, respectively, from the real genome data where tandem duplication genes were removed. the p value of the mean coexpression index values after the removal of tandem duplication genes was still very low . therefore, gene coexpression on the chromosome in es and eb cells was statistically significant regardless the effect of tandem duplication of genes, which had little impact on the observed pattern.

 <dig>  transcriptome coexpression map
given the significant pattern of coexpression, we used the window size of  <dig> and the coexpression index value of  <dig>  as the threshold for transcriptome mapping of es and eb. the threshold coexpression index corresponded to the p value of  <dig>  in the es expression set and  <dig>  in eb. at the threshold value and above,  <dig> genes expressed in es showed coexpression with their neighbors. these genes, along with the  <dig> genes in the neighborhood, defined  <dig> chromosomal domains of coexpression. some of the domains overlapped with each other and represented physically continuous longer stretches of genes on the chromosome. in total,  <dig>  unique genes were recognized from all the identified coexpression domains in the es transcriptome. among the  <dig> genes which had the coexpression index above the threshold,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed between es and eb . similarly,  <dig> chromosomal domains of coexpression with a total of  <dig>  unique genes were identified from the eb expression data. among the  <dig> genes that were above the threshold,  <dig> genes were differentially expressed . the results of the coexpression chromosomal domains are provided in supplementary tables s <dig>  and s <dig>  for es and eb, respectively. fig.  <dig> presents a genomic overview of the coexpression chromosomal domains. fig.  <dig> presents the transcriptome coexpression maps of es and eb on chromosome  <dig>  besides the transcriptome map constructed using the real genome data, a transcriptome map constructed from the randomized genome data is also presented . on the transcriptome map, the coexpression index value of each gene is displayed according to the position of the gene along the chromosome . each dot represents a gene expressed in es  or eb . the yellow line represents the threshold value of the coexpression index . as illustrated on chromosome  <dig> , the transcriptome map by the real genome data  showed various peaks of coexpression on the chromosome. among all the genes analyzed on this chromosome,  <dig>  genes had coexpression index values above the threshold in es . the coexpressed genes included oria <dig>  sox <dig>  aldh3a <dig>  pipox, krtha <dig>  stat <dig>  cox <dig>  mirpl <dig>  and pcyt <dig>  as displayed on the map. many coexpressed genes were adjacent to each other, forming even larger chromosome domains. in contrast, the transcriptome map by the random genome data  showed more uniform peaks of coexpression on the chromosome and few peaks were above threshold value. the comparative transcriptome maps of es and eb for the other chromosomes are presented in supplementary fig. s <dig> .

 <dig>  coexpression pattern of chromosomal domain
the transcriptome map highlighted different coexpression patterns of chromosomal domains between es and eb . among the total  <dig> coexpression domains identified from es and eb expression data,  <dig> domains had the coexpression index above the threshold in both es and eb. the remaining domains had coexpression index values above the threshold in either es or eb but not in both, indicating that there was differential coexpression between es and eb. three specific patterns of coexpression were recognized from the chromosome domains: 1) coexpression observed in es but not in eb; 2) coexpression observed in eb but not es, and 3) coexpression observed in both es and eb. we employed principal component analysis  and hierarchical clustering analysis to further explore the three different coexpression patterns, using sox <dig>  ptprcap, and ngfrap <dig> domains as examples. figs.  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> shows the results of the pca and clustering analysis, along with the transcriptome map and gene expression heatmap. each gene is also shown with the fold-change and anova p value for information of differential expression in the figures. the parallel presentation of the results in fig.  <dig> allow the direct visualization of differential or similar coexpression  of domains  between es and eb.

as shown in fig.  <dig>  the sox <dig> domain represented a pattern in which the degree of coexpression was higher in es than eb. the domain extended for about  <dig> kb at the 17p <dig> region of chromosome  <dig>  as illustrated in the transcriptome map , most genes on the domain had higher coexpression index values in es  than eb , with the highest score observed in sox <dig> , followed by fxr <dig> . no gene expressed in eb had the coexpression index value above the threshold, and the highest one was only  <dig> . pca is robust in capturing and presenting major variations of expression profiles on leading principal components. the pca map  revealed a large difference in the clustering of domain genes and thus the differential coexpression of the gene cluster between es and eb. as shown, the domain genes were clustered tightly together to a small size of ellipsoid by the correlated expression profiles in es , but clustered loosely to a larger ellipsoid by the less correlated expression profiles in eb . the heatmap and cluster analysis showed less diversity on the expression profile among genes in es than eb samples, indicating a higher correlation of expression in es. interestingly, although the domain was differentially coexpressed,  <dig> genes of the domain were not differentially expressed between es and eb samples . the other  <dig> genes were differentially expressed, but displayed various degrees of up- and down-regulation in comparison to the mean expression level.

for the ptprcap domain , on the other hand, the degree of coexpression was higher in eb than es. the domain stretched for  <dig> kb at 11q <dig> . the transcriptome map  showed that most genes in the domain had higher coexpression index values in eb  than es . ten genes on the domain had coexpression indices above the threshold in eb, with the highest observed in ppp1ca . no gene expressed in es had the coexpression index above the threshold, and the highest coexpression index was  <dig>  . the higher coexpression level of the domain in eb than es was also illustrated by the pca and cluster analyses. the pca map showed that the genes expressed in eb  were tightly clustered to a small ellipsoid, whereas the genes expressed in es  were loosely clustered to a much larger ellipsoid. the heatmap showed less diversity on the expression level among genes expressed in eb than es. although the gene cluster was differentially coexpressed,  <dig> genes on the domain were not differentially expressed between es and eb, the other  <dig> genes were differentially expressed, but exhibited mixed patterns of up- or down-regulation.

while the sox <dig> and ptprcap domains showed differential coexpression, the ngfrap <dig> domain  displayed a pattern of similar coexpression between es and eb. the domain was  <dig>  kb long and located at xq <dig> . five or six genes had the coexpression index above the threshold in es and eb, respectively, with the highest observed in ngfrap <dig> . the pca map showed similar clustering of the genes and the heatmap showed similar expression profiles between es and eb, suggesting a similar degree of coexpression in es and eb. although similarly coexpressed, six genes of the domain were differentially expressed between es and eb.

 <dig>  distribution of coexpression domain
the transcriptome map highlighted a non-random distribution pattern of the coexpression chromosomal domains on the genome . we sought to determine whether any chromosome was significantly enriched or over-represented by coexpression domains or domain genes. a fisher's exact test was conducted with the number of domains and domain genes located on each chromosome and on the entire genome. table  <dig> lists the frequency of domains and domain genes on each chromosome and the p value derived from the fisher's exact test . as shown, the coexpression domains and the domain genes were highly frequent on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and y in es, while on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in eb. these chromosomes were associated with low fisher's p values , suggesting a significant enrichment  in genes coexpressed at the domain level.

we next determined whether the identified coexpression chromosomal domains correlated with any known cytogenetic bands on the chromosome. giemsa positive or negative bands, centromeric regions, and variable length heterochromatic regions were examined at the 850-band resolution  <cit> . these cytogenetic patterns represent distinct and reproducible structure of extended and compacted regions on the chromosome. table  <dig> shows the frequency of domain genes in each structural pattern and the p value by the fisher's exact test . among all of the genes in the coexpression chromosomal domains in es,  <dig> %  were located in giemsa-negative bands, and  <dig> %  in giemsa-positive bands. these proportions were similar to those predicted from all known genes on the entire genome  <cit> . ten coexpression domains genes were located in the variable length heterochromatic region , and the p value  <dig> . the variable length heterochromatic region was thus significantly enriched by the coexpression genes in es. on the other hand, the giemsa-negative region was significantly enriched by the coexpression genes in eb .

 <dig>  gene ontology analysis
in order to examine the physiological and biological significance of the identified coexpression chromosome domains, we conducted a functional semantic similarity analysis based on the gene ontology . the semantic similarity is a measure of the number of go terms shared by coexpressed genes of a domain  <cit> . we expected that if coexpression domains were biologically significant, they would be more likely related to certain functions. otherwise, they would be little functional relevant. fig.  <dig> shows the distribution of semantic similarity scores calculated from coexpression chromosome domains in es and eb, respectively, and from a randomized gene set. for the random data, the cumulative probability of genes reached  <dig> when the functional similarity was only as high as  <dig>  that meant all genes in the random data set had the functional similarity of  <dig> or below. for the coexpression domains, the cumulated probability of  <dig>  corresponded to the semantic similarity above  <dig>  indicative of much higher functional similarities in the domain genes. the distributions by the es and eb coexpression domains were significantly different from that by the random data set . the results suggested that the coexpression chromosome domains were biologically and physiologically significant.

we next determined the go terms which were significant associated with coexpression chromosome domains, using the fisher's exact test. the results are shown in supplementary tables s <dig>  and s <dig>  . many domains were associated with biological functions, particularly with the regulation of transcription, transcription factor activity, and chromosome organization. some domains were associated with es – important functions or biological processes, such as apoptosis, pattern specification, histogenesis and organogenesis, embryogenesis and morphogenesis.

discussion
es cell gene expression is carefully regulated and cells either maintain the pluripotent state by self-renewal or undergo differentiation. this is the first study to investigate the coexpression of genes along the chromosome in human es cells and their earliest stage of differentiation in culture, eb's. significant coexpression patterns were revealed and confirmed by random tests and monte-carlo simulation. the coexpression is suggestive of transcriptional regulation operating at the chromosome domain level in es and eb cells. the coexpression domains do not appear to represent amplicons or regions of chromosome imbalance that were previously described in cancer cells  <cit> . the chromosome region with adjacent localization of the genes nanog, stellar, and gdf <dig> has been considered as a hotspot for teratocarcinoma  <cit> . our study however indicated that the genes in the region were not coexpressed, suggestive of no transcriptional regulation operating at this domain in es or eb. nevertheless, the identified coexpression chromosome domains are biologically and physiologically significant, some of which are associated with functions important to es development. new coexpression chromosome domains would possibly be observed when each cell line had been analyzed separately. recent studies have shown that some es cell lines exhibit unique morphological and genetic features  <cit> . the cell line bg01v, for example, shows abnormal chromosome and karyotype, different from other es cells  <cit> .it is thus important to examine cell line specific patterns of local coexpression, which will be the future direction of our studies.

the genes lifr, gp <dig>  stat <dig>  oct3/ <dig>  sox <dig>  utf- <dig>  foxd <dig>  eras, tel <dig>  fgf <dig>  nanog, nodal, tdfg <dig>  cer <dig>  and abcg <dig> have shown to be critical for esc self-renewal and self-renewal and regarded as the "signature"  <cit> . some of these genes were not coexpressed on the chromosome , suggesting that global regions still tend to be involved in determining the overall state of the es cell and provide context for cell-type specific signaling. nonetheless, the other es-signature genes did show coexpression along the chromosome. the genes that were adjacent and coexpressed with the signature genes were often related to development and transcriptional regulation. stat <dig>  for example, is a transcription factor which plays a central role within es self-renewal pathways and feed-back loops  <cit> . the stat <dig> gene, located at 17q <dig>  was coexpressed in es  but not in eb  . the coexpression chromosome domain where stat <dig> resides also contained the duplicated genes stat5b and stat5a, as well as tcf <dig>  a transcription factor important in proliferation and differentiation. other es-signature genes, utf <dig>  tle <dig>  and oct3/ <dig>  showed higher coexpression index in eb  than in es . utf <dig> is a transcription factor, and the domain where the utf <dig> gene is located  contained two other transcriptional factors, ventx <dig> , and nkx6- <dig>  tle <dig> is an es cell-specific gene coding a rna-binding protein which functions downstream of the lif and oct3/ <dig> pathways  <cit> . the tle <dig> gene domain is located at 9q <dig>  and the coexpressed genes included the duplicated gene tle <dig> and signal transduction genes gnaq, gkap <dig>  and gna <dig>  oct3/ <dig> is also a transcriptional factor critical for es cell self-renewal  <cit> . the oct3/ <dig> domain, located at 6p <dig> , contained nfkbil <dig> and mhc class i genes. in addition to the es signature genes, other genes important for es cell development were also found to be coexpressed on the chromosome in es or eb. sox <dig>  for example, is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of embryonic development and transcriptional control in es cells  <cit> . the gene was significantly up-regulated in es cells . the sox <dig> domain  showed coexpression in es cells but not in eb cells, as described above. among the genes on this domain, efnb <dig> belongs to the ephrin gene family and is implicated in development, tnfsf <dig> is a cytokine belonging to the tumor necrosis factor  ligand family, and polr2a, zbtb <dig>  tp <dig>  and fxr <dig> are all involved in transcription. apparently, the differentiation or self-renewal of es cells was evidenced not only by the differential expression of individual genes at the global level, but also by the differential coexpression of genes at the chromosomal domain level.

chromosomal clustering of functionally related genes has been demonstrated in various eukaryotes, including the yeast, fruit fly, nematode, and human  <cit> . natural selection might have organized genes to clusters on the chromosome according to the molecular function or biological process so that their expression can be coordinately regulated. the coexpression of physically adjacent genes may be caused by the long range effect of transcription factors, chromatin structure modifications, or increased concentration of components of the transcriptional machinery  in a particular subnuclear location of chromosomal segments  <cit> . the coexpression could also be due to duplicated genes, which often remain adjacent and have similarexpression patterns  <cit> . our study revealed that gene duplication had a minimal impact and was not a major contributing factor for the observed coexpression pattern in es and eb. our study also revealed differential local coexpression between es and eb. differentially coexpressed genes may not be differentially expressed, while similarly coexpressed genes may be differentially expressed. the transcriptome map thus provides a basis for examining how transcriptional regulation interacts with genomic structure and how genes clustered on the chromosome are coexpressed during the es self-renewal and differentiation.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, the transcriptome map provides information on transcriptional events operating at the local chromosome level in es cells and localized coexpression of genes during differentiation. the identified coexpression chromosome domains are significantly associated with biological or physiological functions, some of which were important for es development. global and local regions are both involved in determining the overall state of the es cell and provide context for cell-type specific signaling. the findings and methods reported in this investigation advance our understanding of how genome organization affects gene expression in human es cells and help to identify new mechanisms and pathways controlling es self-renewal or differentiation.
