BACKGROUND
acanthamoeba is a multifaceted opportunistic pathogen that infects mainly immunocompromised people and/or contact lens wearers  <cit> . despite advances in antimicrobial chemotherapy, the mortality rate associated with acanthamoeba granulomatous encephalitis remains very high, i.e., > 90%  <cit> . this is, in part, due to our incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of acanthamoeba encephalitis.

a whole-organism approach to the study of disease is considered essential in gaining a full understanding of the interrelationships between infectious agents and their hosts  <cit> . at present, mice are most widely used models to study acanthamoeba granulomatous encephalitis in vivo. mostly, acanthamoeba granulomatous encephalitis is limited to individuals with a weakened immune system, so mice are pre-treated generally with corticosteroid to suppress the host defences, followed by intranasal inoculation of acanthamoeba  <cit> .

although vertebrate model systems are seen as immediately more relevant, recent studies have demonstrated the possibility of using insects as a model to study acanthamoeba pathogenesis in vivo  <cit> . thus a major aim of this proposal is to generate wider acceptance of the model by establishing that it can be used to obtain important novel information of relevance to acanthamoeba encephalitis without the use of vertebrate animals. infection-induced anorexia  <cit>  and locust mortality was determined for acanthamoeba isolates belonging to the t <dig> and t <dig> genotypes. it is widely accepted that in the human infection due to acanthamoeba, affected tissues other than the central nervous system  may include subcutaneous tissue, skin, liver, lungs, kidneys, adrenals, pancreas, prostate, lymph nodes and bone marrow, which suggests a haematogenous spread  <cit> . here, histopathological specimens of infected locust tissues are used to determine whether acanthamoeba produces disseminated infection in locusts. in vitro studies suggest that acanthamoeba traverses the human blood-brain barrier by disrupting the human brain microvascular endothelial cells monolayers. because the blood-brain barriers of insects comprise layers of cells joined by tight junctions, it is hypothesised that acanthamoeba invades locust brains by modulating the integrity of the insect's blood-brain barrier.

RESULTS
acanthamoeba isolates belonging to genotypes t <dig> and t <dig> kill locusts
to determine whether acanthamoeba isolates belonging to the t <dig> and t <dig> genotypes kill locusts, and if so, whether the speed of kill is similar among both genotypes, locusts in groups of  <dig> or  <dig> were injected with  <dig> amoebae of one of the isolates, and their mortality recorded every  <dig> h post injection. both isolates of acanthamoeba produced 100% mortality . more than 80% mortality occurred within  <dig> days of infection regardless of which genotype was tested, and this increased to 100% by day  <dig>  the highest rates of mortality were observed between  <dig> -  <dig> days post-injection. similar trends of mortality were observed in both groups of infected locusts, regardless of the amoeba isolate. by contrast, locusts injected with culture medium alone, showed less than 15% mortality by day  <dig> post-injection .

acanthamoeba isolates belonging to genotypes t <dig> and t <dig> induce anorexic effects in locusts
to quantify any possible anorectic effects in locusts due to acanthamoeba injection, body weight changes and faeces production were monitored. both isolates of acanthamoeba induced sickness behaviour in infected locusts, as determined by significant loss of body weight on day  <dig>  , as well as a reduction in faeces production  . the reduction in body weight and faeces production of locusts was similar among all groups of locusts injected with different isolates of acanthamoeba belonging to t <dig> and t <dig> genotypes. of note, although locomotory behaviour was not quantified, after  <dig> days of infection locusts tended to be rather still and less excitable than non-infected locusts, often perching on a blade of wheat without attempting to eat.

acanthamoeba isolates of the t <dig> and t <dig> genotype each invade the locust brain
brains of locusts injected with acanthamoeba were dissected out and cultivated onto non-nutrient agar plates seeded with bacterial lawn. amoebae were recovered from the brains of all groups of locusts injected with different acanthamoeba isolates . one hundred percent of amoebae-infected locusts showed the presence of amoebae in the brain lysates from day  <dig> onwards. as expected, lysates of non-infected control brains showed no growth of viable amoebae . to further confirm the presence of amoebae within the cns, brains from infected locusts were fixed, sectioned and stained using harris' haematoxylin and eosin on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> post-injection . examination of the histological sections revealed that all amoebae isolates tested were able to invade the locust brain . trophozoites were observed inside locust brains on days  <dig> and  <dig>  post-injection, but not on day  <dig> . in general, few amoebae were found in the brains on day  <dig> post-injection , whereas on day  <dig> amoebae were always very numerous .

acanthamoeba invades the locust brain by disrupting the blood-brain barrier
in histological sections of brains from infected locusts on days  <dig> and  <dig> after injection, amoebae were observed in most regions of the brain . notably, the presence of amoebae inside locust brains was associated often with clear evidence of a lesion in the brain capsule, especially on day  <dig> . furthermore, amoebae were observed in several cases  in the vicinity of such lesions in the brain capsule, apparently in the process of invading the brain. such lesions of the brain capsule were never observed in sections of brains from non-infected locusts, and were quite distinct from the occasional mechanical tears in tissue slices introduced during sectioning. in comparison with brains from control locusts, those from acanthamoeba-infected locusts on days  <dig> and  <dig> showed gross disruption and degeneration of the internal organisation of the brain tissue, which was not seen on day  <dig> . isolates of both genotypes tested showed similar findings . moreover, amoebae entry into the locust brain was consistently observed with the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, as shown in the representative images in fig. 3). in controls, locusts' blood-brain barrier was always found to be intact .

acanthamoeba isolates belonging to genotypes t <dig> and t <dig> disseminate within the locust body and invade various tissues
using plating assays, viable amoebae were recovered from the haemolymph of infected locusts on all tested days post injection . infected locusts showed the presence of numerous small black nodules in the head capsule and in the abdomen close to the point of injection , suggesting that the locust's immune system had been activated by the presence of the amoebae  <cit> . furthermore, trophozoites of amoebae were observed in large numbers in the histological sections of deep tissues of flight muscles on days  <dig> and  <dig> post-injection, but not on day  <dig>  degenerative changes in the tissues caused by the amoebae were apparent on days  <dig> and specifically  <dig> . invasion of large numbers of amoebae into the fat body which was often surrounding the brain was evident in the histological studies on these days. huge numbers of amoebae  were identified in the fat body around the brains on days  <dig> and  <dig> after injection, but they were present in much lower numbers on day  <dig> .

amoebae were observed not only in the brain of infected locusts, but also in the suboesophageal ganglion. both isolates of acanthamoeba infiltrated this ganglion and caused noticeable histopathological damage . occasionally, sporadic amoebae in the form of trophozoites were seen also in the lumen of the foregut of some of the infected locusts , but this was not a consistent finding in all foreguts sectioned.

discussion
the availability of in vitro models has made it possible to study, at the molecular level, acanthamoeba interactions with the host cells, such as corneal epithelial/endothelial cells  <cit> , brain microvascular endothelial cells  <cit> , fibroblasts  <cit> , keratocytes  <cit> , macrophages  <cit> , neutrophils  <cit> , and neurones  <cit> . although these models allow in-depth biochemical and molecular investigations in vitro, thus further elucidating mechanisms of infection, they cannot model whole organism responses to infection at the physiological level. this is particularly relevant in brain infection due to acanthamoeba which involves complex interactions between amoeba and the host.

both acanthamoeba genotypes studied here in locusts, reduced faecal output at about  <dig> days post-injection, and killed all locusts within  <dig> days. live acanthamoeba can be recovered from brain lysates of amoebae-injected locusts, and trophozoites can be seen inside infected brains in histological studies. it is intriguing that amoebae are not found in the cns of infected locusts on day three, and they invaded the brain after  <dig> or  <dig> days, with changes in faecal output and fresh body weight respectively becoming apparent. it is tempting to speculate from these temporal relationships that acanthamoeba-mediated locust death is, at least in part, associated with the parasite's invasion of the brain. interestingly, acanthamoeba did invade other parts of the locust cns such as the suboesophageal ganglion, but other ganglia  were not investigated for the presence of amoebae in this study. the suboesophageal ganglion is situated below the crop and is connected to the brain by circumoesophageal connectives, and coordinates movements of the mouthparts, and the activity of the salivary glands. clearly, invasion of the cns by acanthamoeba could affect feeding behaviour, as is suggested by the reduction in faecal output in infected locusts. it seems most likely that the changes in locust physiology and behaviour  are consequent on acanthamoeba-mediated disruption of the blood brain barrier, which leads to neural dysfunction and reduced sensory output/input.

for the first time, histological examination of infected locusts shows that amoebae invaded deep into tissues such as the fat body and muscle, causing appreciable degenerative changes. thus the amoebae invade these tissues, and are not isolated from them simply because they adhere to the surface of the tissues which are bathed in the haemolymph of the insect's open circulatory system. these findings suggest that acanthamoeba produced parasitaemia and survived the onslaught of the innate immune defences of locusts. acanthamoeba invaded different organs of the infected locusts and did not appear to exhibit any specific preference in relation to the tissues that are invaded, a finding that is consistent with the human form of infection, and confirms the validity of locusts as a useful model in which to study the pathogenesis of acanthamoeba granulomatous encephalitis in vivo. furthermore, acanthamoeba granulomatous encephalitis is mostly limited to immunocompromised populations, and insects have an entirely innate immune defence system, suggesting that it is realistic to use locusts as a tractable model in which to study the pathogenesis of acanthamoeba granulomatous encephalitis.

although acanthamoeba spread to many tissues and were found in the haemolymph throughout the course of the infection, none of the isolates  were ever found in locust faeces . for the first time, histological sectioning revealed the occasional presence of some amoebae in the lumen of the locust foregut, but no damage to the wall of the foregut was evident in any of the locusts subjected to microscopic examination. indeed, the apical surfaces of the cells lining the foregut have a cuticle, which could represent a barrier to penetration by acanthamoeba. unfortunately, infected locusts destined for histological examination were not kept isolated from one another , and food replenishment and removal of dead animals took place only once every  <dig> h, so cannibalism was possible if locusts died shortly after this daily routine. it is likely therefore that amoebae observed occasionally in the lumen of foregut were simply there because they were consumed by cannibalism of a dead infected locust. this is a novel finding and it is strengthened by the fact that the histological sections never revealed evidence of damage to the wall of the foregut and suggest that amoebae do not infect locusts via the oral route, a finding that is consistent with infection in vertebrates.

another significant finding was the entry of amoebae into the locust cns, which appeared to be associated with disruption of the neural lamella and the perineurium/glial cell complex that constitutes the locust blood-brain barrier  <cit> . this is consistent with the studies in vitro showing that amoebae cross human brain microvascular endothelial cells, which constitute the blood-brain barrier, by affecting the integrity of the cell monolayer  <cit> . at present, the basis of the damage to the locust blood-brain barrier is not clear, i.e., amoeba and/or host inflammatory response. recent studies in vitro show that serine proteases secreted by acanthamoeba play an important role in affecting the integrity of the human brain microvascular endothelial cell monolayers  <cit> , and the role of proteases and additional virulence determinants will be addressed in future studies in vivo using locusts. in addition, there is a need for a comparative study to test several additional acanthamoeba isolates of various genotypes in locusts versus mice.

CONCLUSIONS
the present findings suggest that locusts provide an excellent model to study the human acanthamoeba granulomatous encephalitis and can elicit a full spectrum of host-pathogen interactions. the locust model can be a valuable tool to resolve the molecular and cellular features of acanthamoeba granulomatous encephalitis and to determine the role of known as well as putative virulence determinants of acanthamoeba in vivo that can be tested subsequently in mammalian systems. such a technically convenient invertebrate model can be used for the initial screening and identification of novel virulence factors, providing useful leads for the rational development and evaluation of therapeutic interventions, and strengthen the move away from a total dependency on vertebrate models.
