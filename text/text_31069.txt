BACKGROUND
songbirds are important models for exploring the neural and genomic mechanisms underlying vocal communication, social experience and learning . songbirds communicate using both innate calls and learned vocalizations , and unique specializations of the brain evolved to support this behavior . in the zebra finch, only the male produces songs, although both sexes process and discriminate specific songs  <cit> . the genome is actively engaged by song communication, as first shown in an early demonstration of how gene responses in the brain discriminate among different song stimuli  <cit> . the genomic response is not a simple correlate of neural activity and it can vary significantly according to the salience and behavioral context of the experience  <cit> . recent studies using microarray technology have now shown that song exposure affects the expression of thousands of genes in the auditory forebrain  <cit> . repeated exposure to one song leads to an altered gene expression profile, correlated with habituation of both the behavioral and immediate genomic responses to that specific song. these observations suggest the involvement of large and dynamic transcriptional network in the recognition and memory of complex vocal signals  <cit> .

micrornas  are emerging as potential control points in transcriptional networks, and may be particularly important for the evolution of brain and behavior. many mirnas are expressed in the brain  <cit> , often in different patterns in different species  <cit> . brain mirnas undergo dramatic changes in expression during development  <cit>  and aging  <cit>  and have been functionally implicated in neurological disease  <cit> . they may also function in the normal physiological operation of the nervous system as suggested by evidence for involvement of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in circadian clock regulation  <cit>  and mir- <dig> in control of dendritic translation  <cit> .

here we apply massively parallel illumina sequencing to probe the involvement of mirnas in the processing of song experience in the zebra finch auditory forebrain. we begin by identifying  <dig> different mirna sequences and the genomic loci of their precursor sequences in the zebra finch genome, including  <dig> mirna genes that have not been detected in the genomes of other species. we then ask whether the mirna content changes after song exposure and find robust evidence of mirna responses to song playbacks. we also assess correlations between expression changes of a novel mirna and its predicted target mrnas during song habituation. the results indicate an active role for mirnas in the neural processing of a natural perceptual experience - hearing the sound of another bird singing.

RESULTS
the mirnas of the zebra finch auditory forebrain
we carried out illumina small rna sequencing  on the small rna  fraction of total rna isolated from adult zebra finch auditory forebrain. ultimately, we performed  <dig> illumina runs on  <dig> different rna samples, to assess the effects of song exposure . first we describe the overall small rna profile obtained by combining the results of all the runs, representing  <dig> adult zebra finches . a total of  <dig> million reads were obtained  and aligned to reference mirna sequences from other species . overall we identified  <dig> non-redundant mirnas representing 52% of sequences that have been previously identified in chicken, rodent and human. the remaining sequences mapping to the pirna database were denoted as pirna reads  .

six different pools of auditory forebrain were analyzed independently by illumina small rna sequencing, as described in the text.

reads that did not align to known rnas were assessed for mirna potential through a novel mirna discovery pipeline described by creighton et al. <cit>  which tests for properties that are characteristic of known mirnas. these properties include the following: 1) the mature sequence must map to the stem region of the hairpin sequence of the putative precursor extracted from the zebra finch genome. 2) the mature mirna sequence must map to the precursor such that it can be processed following the drosha processing rules  <cit> . all novel mirna candidates that map to the loop region and/or lack appropriate drosha processing sites are failed. 3) known mirnas have stable 5'-ends that vary at the most by +/-  <dig> nucleotide. 4) by contrast the 3'-ends of mirnas are highly heterogeneous in length due to imprecise dicer processing  <cit>  and exhibit non-templated nucleotide sequence changes due to rna editing  <cit> . 5) consequently, the putative precursor must give a strong signal of sequence alignments in a tight area of 18- <dig> nucleotides. small rna sequences that are distributed fairly evenly along the entire length of the precursor are rejected since they likely represent degraded products of a large rna. the candidates that also demonstrate the presence of the mirna star sequence  mapping on the opposite side of the mature mirna and occurring at a lower abundance in the deep sequencing data are considered to be confirmed novel mirnas in zebra finch. using this pipeline  we discovered  <dig> putative novel mirnas that map on the zebra finch genome to a stem loop structure that folds with a minimum free energy of < - <dig> kcal/mol  <cit> . the complete analysis and mapping information for all the novel mirna candidates is given in additional file  <dig>  tables s <dig> and s <dig> 

all novel mirna candidates were mapped to genomic loci in the zebra finch genome assembly  <cit> , and also to human and chicken genomes using the blat function of the ucsc genome browser . in the zebra finch genome, the loci include both annotated exons and introns as well as unannotated intergenic regions. thirty-four  novel micrornas uncovered from zebra finch are not presently detected in the human or chicken genome assemblies. eleven  map to genome positions in chicken, and six to positions in the human . tgu-mir- <dig> maps to three loci in the finch and  <dig> in the chicken, indicating a probable expansion of this mirna in the chicken lineage. this putative novel mirna is not currently detected in the human assembly hg <dig>  tgu-mir- <dig> is intriguing as it is located within two stem loops within the introns of two functionally related genes: the glutamate receptor subunits gria <dig> and gria <dig> in all three genomes.

mirna responses to song exposure
when zebra finches are exposed to playback of a song they have not heard recently, changes occur in the expression of many different mrnas as detected  <dig> min after stimulus onset  <cit> . to determine whether specific mirnas also change in expression, we counted the illumina reads in samples of rna pooled from the auditory forebrain of birds either  <dig> min after onset of song playback  or from matched controls . in our first such experiment, the birds in both groups were all males . the read count for each mirna in each sample was normalized to the total number of usable reads mapped in that sample. we then calculated the ratio of the normalized count in the song-stimulated condition compared to the silence condition and performed a fisher's exact test  to evaluate whether the ratio differed significantly from the range of expected values at a 95% confidence interval. in the initial experiment with males,  <dig> of the known conserved mirnas showed a significant difference, with  <dig> decreasing and  <dig> increasing in the group exposed to song .

to address the biological reproducibility of the mirna responses to song more broadly, we then repeated the small rna-seq comparison two additional times using new groups of birds. in the second experiment, we used only females, and in the third we used an equal mix of males and females. in total, therefore, we performed three independent "song-silence" pairwise comparisons by small rna-seq, with an overall sex balance but different sex ratios in each individual comparison. these second and third experiments were done six months after the first and illumina technology had improved by this time so that we obtained twice as many read counts  - but again we normalized to the total mapped read number in each individual sample for our statistic analyses. as in the first experiment, we again observed differential read counts for roughly a third of the mirnas, but the identities of the mirnas affected were somewhat different in each comparison. this is summarized graphically as a venn diagram , and comprehensive read count data are presented in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  across all three experiments, five conserved mirnas showed changes that were both significant and in same direction in all comparisons . for a number of other mirnas, including let-7f, an apparent effect of song exposure was measured in all three experiments but the direction of change was not consistent .

shown are the illumina read data for the five mirnas that show a consistent response to song . "song" and "silence" list raw counts from the illumina read analysis . "fold change" is the ratio of song versus silence read counts, after the raw counts were normalized within each run to the sum of mapped reads for that sample. thus a value of >  <dig> indicates a relative increase in the group exposed to song, and <  <dig> indicates a decrease. "fdr-p" indicates the result of the fisher's exact test  for this comparison. see additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> for full list of values for all mirnas, and associated taqman values for a subset of these mirnas .

we performed taqman assays on rna from additional birds, probing for eleven of the "significantly affected" mirnas, and obtained fluorescent signals in pcr for ten. in nine out of ten cases, we observed the same direction of song response by taqman as in the small rna-seq experiment, although the p-value by taqman was below  <dig>  in only five cases . the lack of statistical significance in the taqman assay for the others could reflect differences in the sensitivity and resolution of illumina vs. taqman assays, or the operation of other uncontrolled factors in our experiments that lead to variability in the expression of some mirnas.

the transcriptional response in the auditory forebrain of zenk and other mrnas is specific to song relative to non-song auditory stimuli  <cit> . to test for song-specificity of the mirna response, we conducted a further taqman experiment assessing the levels of six mirnas , in birds who had heard either a normal song or a carefully matched non-song acoustic stimulus, "song enveloped noise" . sen has the same amplitude envelope as the song from which it is derived but spectral content has been randomized so it does not sound like a song  <cit> . by taqman pcr, we confirmed that normal song induced a larger increase in zenk mrna in these birds than did sen . in these same animals, normal song, but not sen, triggered a significant decrease in the levels of tgu-mir- <dig>  tgu-mir-129-5p, tgu-mir- <dig> and tgu-mir-2954-3p . thus we conclude that there is indeed a unique mirna response in the auditory forebrain that is selective for song over non-song acoustic stimuli.

a complex sex-linked mirna locus in zebra finch and other birds
the novel mirna, tgu-mir- <dig>  that was detected most frequently in our illumina assays maps to the sense strand of an intron in the xpa gene, on the z chromosome . the precursor hairpin contains reads from both arms, thus meeting our bioinformatic criteria for a confirmed mirna . by contrast to most known mirnas, the numbers of reads from both 5' and 3' arms were found at similar copy numbers, suggesting that both arms may make functional mature mirnas. blast analysis of the mir- <dig> hairpin precursor sequence against the ncbi nr database identified a putative mature mirna in chicken , and blat analysis of a collection of transcripts from crocodile and  <dig> other bird species  <cit>  detected mir- <dig> transcripts in  <dig> non-passerine species  and  <dig> passerine species  . there was no blat hit in the crocodile, the remaining  <dig> non-passerine birds , and  <dig> passerine species . the lack of a hit does not necessarily mean absence of the gene as these datasets represent incomplete transcriptomes derived by  <dig> sequencing  <cit> . these results clarify that the sequence is not unique to the zebra finch or passerines, but may nevertheless have a restricted distribution within birds.

to validate the existence of these two mirnas in zebra finch, we performed taqman analyses for both, using their reverse complements as controls. interestingly, we got significant expression values not only for the predicted mirnas but also for one of the reverse-complement mirnas  although no significant song regulation for mir-2954r-5p was found . with respect to the xpa gene within which this locus is embedded , these data suggest that precursor-mirna-stem loops are produced from both the sense  and antisense strands. the stem loop precursor processed by drosha from the sense rna  generates two active mirnas from its both arms . the stem loop precursor processed by drosha from the antisense rna  generates at least one active mirna  from its 5' end sequence.

we carried out northern analysis on tgu-mir-2954-3p, which is the mirna that has the highest number of read counts detected in our illumina assays among the three mirnas from the tgu-mir- <dig> locus. a robust signal at ~ <dig> nucleotides is evident in mixed-sex pools of rna from birds hearing either song or silence, and a weaker signal is also detectable in two female-only pools of rna . greater expression in males is consistent with the zz genotype of males and the lack of efficient sex chromosome dosage compensation in the zebra finch  <cit> .

by taqman as well as by illumina, we observed an apparent sex difference in the direction of the response of tgu-mir-2954-3p to song - up in males and down in females . this suggests this locus may be under complex regulation, integrating information about sex, auditory or social experience and perhaps also other factors related to xpa gene expression.

to gain insight into the potential functional role of tgu-mir-2954-3p in the response to song, we used a conservative strategy to predict gene targets that are both conserved in birds and responsive to song exposure in the zebra finch. potential targets of mirnas are described as mrnas that have sequences that can undergo watson-crick base pairing with the 5'-seed  of the mirna  <cit> . for target prediction we applied the targetscan  algorithm using the chicken genome as an initial reference, and then confirmed presence of the target sequence in the zebra finch. for evidence of song responsiveness, we used the data set of dong et al.  <cit> . eight genes met all these criteria  and are thus both song-responsive and also subject to regulation by tgu-mir-2954-3p. these genes all have functions in control of cell proliferation or neurite outgrowth .

we used targetscan to find binding sites of tgu-mir-2954-3p on eight chicken genes and here are listed the information of their homologous genes in the zebra finch genome including ensembl ids, gene symbols, est  and gene names .

discussion
here we show that a natural perceptual experience, hearing the sound of another bird singing, alters the profile of mirnas in parts of the songbird brain responsible for auditory perception, integration and memory. the song-regulated population includes both known  and novel mirnas. we highlight one sex-linked song-responsive mirna and identify mrnas that are potential targets of its action during song exposure. thus mirnas may have roles in the information processing functions of the brain, in addition to their roles in brain development and evolution.

to demonstrate this, we first catalogued the mirnas expressed in the adult zebra finch auditory forebrain. we used massively parallel illumina sequencing of small rnas to perform this cataloguing efficiently. in addition to known conserved mirnas, our analysis identified  <dig> small rna sequences that meet the structural criteria for mirnas but had not been described in mirbase in any organism at the time of our analysis. fourteen of these are detected in the chicken or human genome assemblies and may give rise to mirnas that have not yet been described elsewhere due to low copy number, restricted tissue distribution or other factors. the remaining novel mirnas,  <dig> in number, may be unique to the zebra finch or the songbird lineage. few studies have attempted de novo identification of mirnas from the brain  <cit>  and ours is the first to report direct sequencing of songbird brain mirnas. a previous study did identify precursor sequences for five conserved mirnas in the developing zebra finch brain  <cit> . also, in parallel with our own illumina analysis, li and her colleagues used  <dig> sequencing to identify mirnas in the brain and liver of adult zebra finches. these different sets of annotations are compared and collated in a supplement to the analysis of the zebra finch genome assembly  <cit> .

by comparing birds hearing novel song playbacks or silence, we found evidence for experience-dependent fluctuations in large numbers of mirnas in the auditory forebrain. we performed three separate pairwise comparisons by illumina, where all aspects of the experimental conditions were carefully counterbalanced between the two groups in each comparison. the three comparisons were not direct replications of each other, as each had a different sex ratio. our reasons for varying the sex ratio were partly pragmatic  and partly analytical . some of the differences between the three sets of results may reflect real biological differences in the responses of males and females. indeed, our northern analysis of the tgu-mir-2954-3p confirms a sex difference in expression of this z-linked mirna gene. this is especially intriguing because we also obtained taqman evidence for both sense and antisense transcripts of this mirna. one can imagine scenarios where different ratios of sense and antisense transcription occur in males  and females  with different consequences on the transcriptional networks affected by song exposure in the two sexes.

ignoring the potential effects of sex, we identified five mirnas that showed significant and consistent changes in response to song across all three illumina comparisons. three mirnas consistently decreased after song  and two increased . the down-regulated mirnas are at much higher abundance  and perhaps for this reason we were more successful at detecting them and replicating their song regulation by taqman assay in subsequent experiments with additional groups of birds. the most abundant mirna in our regulated set, tgu-mir- <dig>  consistently met the statistical test for significant down-regulation by song, in each of six separate experiments .

in studies in other species, mir- <dig> has been linked to brain plasticity and development in several contexts. chronic cocaine administration results in down-regulation of mir- <dig> in the rodent mesolimbic dopaminergic system  <cit> . in the developing chick neural tube, mir-124a is a component of a regulatory network that controls the transition between neural progenitors and post-mitotic neurons  <cit> . mir- <dig> also regulates adult neurogenesis, and its overexpression promotes neuronal differentiation  <cit>  and neurite outgrowth  <cit> . intriguingly, in songbirds neurogenesis continues in the forebrain throughout adulthood, from a population of precursor cells that line the walls of the lateral ventricles and have the characteristics of neural stem cells  <cit> . the net rate of neuronal addition and loss in the adult songbird has been shown to depend on social and environmental influences  <cit> . perhaps tgu-mir- <dig> is a regulatory link between experience and neurogenesis - further study of this fascinating possibility is clearly warranted.

although mirnas can have diverse functions, they often act by altering the concentrations of specific mrnas they target via complementary base pairing. we used the targetscan algorithm  <cit>  to predict binding sites of tgu-mir-2954-3p in chicken genes, and then we confirmed the presence of the same conserved target sequence in the zebra finch genome assembly. we found eight targets that met these criteria and were also regulated by song in the dong et al. microarray data  <cit> . these eight genes have a provocative coherence in their function, as they are all implicated in control of cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation. six operate by affecting gene expression and chromatin remodeling as we briefly review here. elavl <dig> is a member of a protein family that binds au-rich regions in the 3'utr of genes such as c-fos and promotes the shift from cell proliferation into cellular differentiation  <cit> . tlk <dig> is a kinase tightly associated with dna replication during cell division  <cit> . at least one of its targets, the histone chaperone asf <dig>  controls chromatin assembly, thus tlk <dig> activity can regulate transcription and elongation  <cit> . btg <dig> is also regulated during the cell cycle  <cit> . it acts as a cofactor for hoxb <dig>  a transcription factor that controls cell proliferation and differentiation, and btg <dig> reduces rates of cell proliferation  <cit> . chd <dig> can potentially affect transcription of many genes by remodeling chromatin  <cit> ; disruption of chd <dig> has profound consequences for development and is implicated in many human diseases  <cit> . hmgb <dig> is another dna binding protein that facilitates transcription by altering chromatin structure to ease promoter binding  <cit> . some of the genes regulated by hmgb <dig> may play a role in cell proliferation and migration  <cit> . neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth are affected by crkl, a transcriptional activator that is a component of the reelin pathway  <cit> . unlike the other six genes, negr <dig> and lingo <dig> do not seem to alter transcription but they do have established roles in neuronal differentiation. negr <dig> affects cell-cell adhesion to modulate neurite outgrowth and synapse formation  <cit> . lingo <dig> is one member of a family of transmembrane proteins that are involved in neural and axonal regeneration  <cit> . the function of lingo <dig> is untested, but expression of a related protein, lingo <dig>  is attenuated in cortical areas deprived of sensory input and is a partner in a signaling pathway that correlates with neuronal activity during a learning paradigm  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, these data reveal a network of mirnas in the zebra finch's auditory forebrain, responsive to the experience of hearing another bird sing. the network includes well-characterized conserved mirna known to have roles in neuronal differentiation , and novel mirnas that can target genes that control neuronal differentiation . our data suggest this mirna network may influence the fundamental shift we have observed in the transcriptional and metabolic state of the auditory forebrain during the process of song-specific habituation  <cit> . further study of song responses in the zebra finch may reveal general insights into the neurogenomic mechanisms that underlie learning, memory and the ongoing adaptation to experience.
