BACKGROUND
dengue fever and associated dengue hemorrhagic fever are emerging globally as the most important arboviral disease threatening human populations. dengue virus  is transmitted to humans by the mosquitoes aedes aegypti and aedes albopictus. when ingested into the mosquito midgut with blood, denv first interacts with midgut cell membrane receptors and then enters the cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. following replication in midguts, denv disseminates to salivary glands for transmission to human. in the mosquito, denv is attacked by the mosquito innate immune system, including rnai and toll pathway  <cit> . in addition, the effects of several host genes were reported to determine the mosquito's susceptibility to dengue infection  <cit> .

denv belongs to the genus flavivirus of the flaviviridae family. flaviviruses are small, enveloped viruses with a single-stranded positive-sense rna, which can be translated into a single polyprotein by host cell proteins. the polyprotein is then cleaved into individual proteins by both viral and host proteases  <cit> . three structural proteins  constitute the virus particle. seven non-structural proteins , 5' and 3' untranslated regions  are involved in rna replication. the n-terminus of ns <dig> codes a serine protease essential for virus replication, and the central domain of ns2b is a cofactor for the ns <dig> serine protease. virus-host interactions start with binding of the envelope protein e to a cellular receptor. then, a complex interplay of viral and cellular proteins modulates the process of viral translation, replication, and assembly  <cit> . most previous studies on the replication mechanisms of denv have been conducted in human cells. these studies identified putative cellular receptors and other host proteins that may interact with viral proteins or rnas  <cit> . in contrast, relatively little has been done to elucidate how denv utilizes the cellular factors to enter and replicate in mosquito cells. it remains unclear which virus replication features are responsible for efficient virus passage between these different host systems.

availability of genome sequences for both humans and the mosquito vector, ae. aegypti, now provides us novel opportunities to identify the host factors that are required for dengue infection. recently, microarray and rnai screens were used for genome-wide studies of interactions between denv and their hosts. they led to identification of a number of cellular factors that can determine the susceptibility and resistance of both hosts to denv  <cit> . these results also emphasize the complexity of interactions between flaviviruses and its hosts. understanding of such interactions requires systematic and comprehensive studies of the host biology as it relates to viral infections. analysis of protein interaction network is one way to dissect such complex interactions and has been broadly used to study the systems biology of host-pathogen interactions  <cit> .

this systems biology approach requires the construction of signaling and regulatory networks. physical interactions between two proteins are the basis for protein complexes and signaling networks, while transcription factors regulate gene transcription by binding to their target dna sequences in the context of intricate transcriptional regulatory networks. large amounts of high-throughput data are now available in several model organisms for protein-protein interactions  <cit> , which have been extensively used in network reconstruction and systems biology studies. however, the high cost of experimental methods prevents large scale interaction network mapping of newly sequenced genomes. computational approaches provide a viable alternative for protein-protein interaction mapping. experimental interactomes in model organisms can be transferred to other species based on homology information. this interolog approach has been widely used to build protein interaction networks in humans  <cit>  and other species  <cit> . although unique interactions in a new species can not be found by the interolog method, the predicted interactomes may reveal conserved complexes and pathways, and serve as important tools for annotating uncharacterized proteins  <cit> . the same concept can be applied to predict interactions between proteins in different species.

uetz et al. predicted interactions between herpesvirus and human proteins based on known interacting orthologs in model organisms, and co-immuniprecipitation confirmed 68% of their predictions  <cit> . denv consists of only  <dig> proteins, which lack orthologs in model organisms. however, viruses in the genus flavivirus often target the same host proteins, so known flavivirus-host interactions may be used to predict denv-mosquito protein interactions. recently, a high throughput rnai screen in human cells identified  <dig> host susceptibility factors and  <dig> host resistant factors for the infection of west nile virus . more importantly, targeted silencing of the wnv host factors found that half of the  <dig> susceptibility factors and all of the  <dig> resistant factors affected dengue infection in the same manner as they affected wnv infection  <cit> . additional independent studies also provide evidence that multiple flaviviruses, including wnv, japanese encephalitis  and denv, target the same host proteins  <cit> . it was reported that these flaviviruses share a similar genomic organization and replication strategy although they cause a range of distinct clinical diseases in humans  <cit> .

evidence also indicates the notable conservation of required dengue host factors between insects and humans. recently, a genome-wide rna interference screen in drosophila melanogaster cells identified  <dig> dengue virus host factors. among them,  <dig> have human homologues. using targeted sirna,  <dig> % of them proved to be dengue host factors in humans  <cit> . a number of conserved host factors were also identified in several earlier studies. in both mosquitoes and humans, la protein interacts with 5' and 3' ends of dengue viral rna and two nonstructural proteins ns <dig> and ns <dig>  such interactions seem important for assembly of a functional replication complex of dengue virus  <cit> . laminin-binding protein and heat shock proteins were also indicated to mediate the dengue infection in both humans and mosquitoes  <cit> . moreover, a similar internalization route  was used by dengue viruses to enter into human and mosquito cells.

in this study, we have developed the mosquito protein interaction network based on large-scale protein interaction datasets in saccharomyces cerevisiae, caenorhabditis elegans and drosophila melanogaster.  <dig> flavivirus-associated mosquito proteins were inferred from three data sources based on physical interaction assays, genome-wide rnai screens and microarray results. an integrated analysis of dengue-associated protein interaction sub-networks highlighted four regions consisting of highly interconnected proteins with closely related functions. finally, we verified that five out of ten  randomly selected genes were required for denv infection in the main mosquito vector, ae. aegypti, by rnai-mediated gene silencing.

RESULTS
construction of the first-draft mosquito protein interaction map
reliable protein interaction datasets in model organisms are the basis of the interolog method. because large-scale protein interaction mapping generates a high number of false positive interactions, it is essential to assess the quality of experimentally determined protein interactions. to generate the draft mosquito interaction network, we selected different interaction datasets with available confidence scores or rankings. the dataset in s. cerevisiae includes  <dig>  interactions identified by co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid screens. each interaction is associated with a confidence score estimated by the logistic regression model  <cit> . the two-hybrid-based dataset in d. melanogaster includes  <dig>  interactions with a confidence score estimated by a generalized linear model  <cit> . the dataset in c. elegans  includes literature-mined data and two-hybrid generated data divided into three confidence classes  <cit> . for all three datasets, confidence metrics were generated using only statistical and topological predictors, such as the number of interaction partners and a local clustering coefficient. these scores were combined with the inparanoid  <cit>  score to generate confidence values for predicted interactions in ae. aegypti.

our predictions resulted in  <dig>  interactions for  <dig>  mosquito proteins, for which the average confidence score is  <dig>  . to test the effectiveness of our confidence scoring scheme, we examined the association of semantic similarity and confidence score for the predicted interactions. interacting proteins often participate in the same molecular pathway and are located in the same cellular compartment. functional relatedness has been shown to be the best feature in discriminating true interactions from noise  <cit> , and our previous work demonstrated the advantage of gene ontology -based similarity measures in protein interaction validation  <cit> . among our predicted interactions, there are  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  interacting protein pairs with annotation of three go sub-categories: biological process, molecular function, and cellular component, respectively. our results indicate that high confidence interactions correlate with protein pairs with high semantic similarity, suggesting the effectiveness of our confidence scoring scheme and the quality of our predictions . because a large number of go annotations for ae. agypti proteins are based on sequence homology to d. melanogaster, the high correlation between semantic similarity and confidence score of interacting proteins predicted from drosophila may simply reflect their correlation in drosophila. thus, we have repeated the analysis using interactions predicted from yeast alone. this dataset also shows an apparent correlation between interaction confidence and functional similarity , indicating the effectiveness of our confidence scoring scheme.

using predicted interactions with confidence values more than  <dig> , we constructed a weighted protein interaction network for ae. aegypti . the network includes  <dig>  mosquito proteins with  <dig>  interactions, of which 62%, 25%, 11% and 2% were inferred from yeast, fly, worm, and more than one reference organism, respectively . among all the proteins in our network,  <dig>  proteins are connected into a single interconnected network by  <dig>  interactions. the number of interacting partners per node in the interconnected network is  <dig> , and the degree distribution fits a power law distribution with a degree exponent of  <dig> . as expected, the network also has a high clustering coefficient  and a short path length .

prediction of mosquito protein function
cellular functions are often carried out by a group of physically or functionally linked molecules that work together to complete distinct tasks. the high clustering coefficient observed in our network indicates that isolated functional modules may be identified from the network. the markov cluster algorithm  identifies highly connected modules based on simulation of stochastic flow in graphs. it has been shown to be the most robust algorithm for the extraction of protein complexes from protein-protein interaction networks  <cit> . using this algorithm, we parsed the mosquito protein interaction network into  <dig> densely connected clusters .

we searched for go biological processes overrepresented in clusters with more than  <dig> members and functionally annotated  <dig> clusters . the results indicate that 76% of clusters have one or more enriched go terms . the composition of each cluster is a valuable resource for the annotation of hypothetical proteins in ae. aegypti. for example, cluster  <dig> comprising  <dig> proteins represents the rna polymerase complex . there are eight hypothetical proteins in this cluster while the remaining eighteen proteins are related to transcription with sixteen of them  annotated as dna-directed rna polymerase. it is most likely that the eight hypothetical proteins also belong to this functional group. thus, putative function of hypothetical proteins might be inferred by their proximity to functionally annotated proteins in a cluster. considering that a large number of ae. aegypti genes are defined as hypothetical proteins, our clustered interaction network provides an useful resource for further annotation of those genes.

emerging hypotheses of biological pathways in mosquitoes
detailed examination of local interaction networks may reveal interconnections of biological pathways and provide further insights on how a biological process is controlled in mosquitoes. here we focus on the mosquito biological processes that have attracted increasing interest in recent years.

the mosquito toll pathway is involved in defense against fungal and viral infection  <cit> . activation of the toll pathway leads to a cascade of events that result in the degradation of cact, translocation of rel <dig> transcription factors to the nucleus, and a rapid increase in synthesis of antimicrobial compounds and other effectors  <cit> . as expected, we observed that cact interacts with both rel1a  and rel1b  in the network . cact also interacts with aael <dig>  an ortholog of drosophila fmr <dig>  along with the hypothetical protein aael <dig>  interestingly, fmr <dig> has been shown to be part of the rnai-related machinery  <cit> . in drosophila, fmr <dig> forms a complex comprising of argonaute  <dig>  and a drosophila homolog of p <dig> rna helicase , both of which are required for efficient rnai  <cit> . considering that both the rnai and toll pathways can control dengue infection in mosquitoes, it will be worthwhile to test whether fmr <dig> serves as a potential link between the two pathways. moreover, our network indicates that fmr <dig> interacts with dock , an insulin pathway related gene, which further interacts with an apoptosis-related protein aael <dig> , an ubiquitin-protein ligase aael <dig>  and md2-like receptor aael <dig> . in addition, cact indirectly interacts with three heat shock proteins , including aael <dig>  aael <dig>  aael <dig>  and one hsp70-interacting protein chip  .

stat is a key component in the jak/stat pathway. in the mosquito protein interaction network, it interacts with eight proteins including aael <dig>  an ortholog of drosophila caudal . cad also interacts with two proteins associated with the insulin signaling pathway: pi3k21b  and akt <dig>  . this implies a potential link between the jak/stat and insulin pathways. further examination of the network found cad interacting with  <dig> proteins. thus, as a hub protein in the networks, cad may have diverse functions and be essential for the survival of ae. aegypti.

sex lethal  is involved in sex determination in drosophila. in the network, eight proteins interact with ae. aegypti sxl . two of them are hypothetical proteins. although no evidence suggests these eight proteins are involved in sex determination, six of them are involved in either rna binding or rna helicase activity . thus, similar to its drosophila ortholog, sxl might function as a splicing and translational regulator in mosquito.

mosquito odorant-binding proteins  were input into the network to identify their interaction partners. five odorant-binding proteins and two hypothetical proteins interact with the sterol carrier protein- <dig> , a protein which is thought to be involved in intracellular cholesterol transport. obp56e  interacts with hyperkinetic, a gene involved in potassium ion transport, and one hypothetical protein .

prediction and analysis of mosquito responses to dengue infection
a comprehensive mapping of mosquito protein interactions targeted by denv could provide specific hypotheses and a broad perspective on denv strategies for replication and persistence in mosquitoes. previous microarray assays revealed broad responses to denv infection in mosquitoes that entailed a variety of physiological systems  <cit> . a recent genome wide rnai screen in human demonstrated a complex dependence of flaviviruses on host cell physiology, requiring a wide variety of molecules and cellular pathways for successful infection  <cit> . in addition, studies of physical interactions between flaviviruses and their hosts also provided insight on how viruses hijack the host pathways for their entry and replication. with the mosquito protein interaction network constructed, we can now put all these together and perform an integrated analysis to identify the spectrum of mosquito pathways activated by denv and other flaviviruses.

prediction of dengue-associated ae. aegypti proteins
we inferred ae. aegypti proteins associated with denv infection using three separate datasets. the first dataset was based on rnai screens in human and drosophila cell lines. among  <dig> denv host factors identified in drosophila with recognizable human homologues,  <dig> are also human denv host factors  <cit> . in addition,  <dig> human genes have been shown to be associated with wnv, of which  <dig> also affect denv infection  <cit> . given these virus-associated host genes, we inferred  <dig> ae. aegypti orthologs which may be involved in denv infection . these included  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> ae.aegypti orthologs from denv host factors in drosophila, human and both, respectively. secondly, we predicted  <dig> mosquito proteins that may directly bind to flavivirus proteins or rnas based on known host-flavivirus physical interactions collected by literature search . the third dataset was derived by genome-wide transcriptional profiling of ae. aegypti response to dengue infection. a large number of genes  in mosquito midgut and the remaining carcass are differentially expressed in response to virus infection  <cit> . taken together, we have identified  <dig> putative dengue associated-mosquito proteins.

there is an overlap between the three datasets with  <dig> proteins supported by two data resources . the latter includes two putative immune related genes: ctlma <dig>  and rm62a . ctlma <dig> is a member of the gene family c-type lectins , which are host pathogen-recognition receptors that are specialized in sensing invading pathogens  <cit> . rm62a is involved in rnai process http://cegg.unige.ch/insecta/immunodb, which has been shown to an important pathway through which mosquito defend against dengue infection.

the results are derived from rnai screen, physical interaction assay and microarray assay. except indicated in parenthesis, data are from denv-host interactions. +, interactions supported by experiments; -, interaction not supported by experiments; n/a, data are unavailable; denv, dengue virus; wnv, west nile virus.

we identified enriched go terms from the three datasets based on a hypergeometric test with benjamini and hochberg multiple testing correction . strikingly, we observed that the same biological processes were overrepresented in rnai and physical interaction-inferred datasets . two go terms, protein transport and establishment of localization, were significantly enriched in putative mosquito proteins that bind to viral proteins/rnas and affect the viral infection . to initiate infection, denv binds to and enters host cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis  <cit> . physical interaction between the dengue e protein and the mosquito tubulin protein  has been shown to facilitate internalization of denv  <cit> , and the rnai screen provided additional evidence for the role of tubulin in the assembly/transport of the virus particles. denv also utilizes host proteins for the replication of its genome. the minus-strand 3'utr of denv might form the replication complex with calreticulin , which may actively participate in the process of rna-dependent rna synthesis  <cit> . while rnai screens investigate the role of host genes in viral infections, microarray profiling shows the expression change of host genes in response to viral infections. cell death was enriched in the microarray dataset, which was consistent with previous studies indicating that denv infection induced the expression of mosquito genes involved in apoptosis  <cit>  and resulted in mosquito cell death  <cit> .our results suggest that different pathways may be involved in the life cycle of viruses and host responses to viral infections.

only p values that reach the significant level are shown. * ns, non-significant.

network analysis of putative dengue-associated mosquito proteins
among the  <dig> putative denv-associated proteins,  <dig> proteins could be found in the weighted ae. aegypti protein interaction network. we created sub-networks associated with denv infections by including neighbor proteins that directly connect to at least three of the above denv-associated proteins. after removing isolated proteins and clusters with less than four members, we identified one major and five minor sub-networks, which contain  <dig> denv-associated proteins and  <dig> neighbor proteins connected by  <dig>  interactions . further functional analysis of the major sub-network highlighted four regions consisting of highly interconnected proteins with closely related functions in each of replication/transcription/translation , metabolism, immunity and transport . to confirm that the above functional groups are more interconnected than the rest of the network, we calculated their graph density in comparison with the density of the global network and random protein groups of the same size taken from the same network. the graph density is defined as the ratio of the number of edges and the number of possible edges in the graph. there are  <dig> proteins connected by  <dig>  edges in the major dengue-associated sub-network with a graph density of  <dig> . functional group rtt consists of  <dig> proteins connected by  <dig>  edges with a graph density of  <dig> . then, we randomly retrieved  <dig> proteins from the major dengue-associated sub-network and calculated its graph density. out of  <dig>  repeated random sampling, there were only  <dig> random groups that have graph density more than that of the rtt group, indicating a permutation-based p-value of less than  <dig> . similarly, the graph densities for metabolism, immunity and transport groups were calculated to be  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. their permutation-based p-values are all less than  <dig> , supporting the existence of distinct functional groups in the dengue-associated protein interaction network.

rtt is the most complicated region in the major denv-associated sub-network, and is comprised of  <dig> proteins . except for  <dig> proteins with unknown or diverse functions, the largest proportion  of the proteins in this region plays roles in replication, transcription and translation. this can be explained by denv hijacking cellular proteins to aid in their own replication and transcription and their reliance on host machinery for their translation. as an example, la protein  was reported to bind to the 3'and 5' end utr of viral rna  <cit> . la protein has also been shown to inhibit viral rna synthesis in a dose-dependent manner in mosquito ae. albopictus  <cit> . as a rna-binding protein, la is normally located in the nucleus. it has to be redistributed to the cytoplasm of dengue-infected cells to play its role in the viral replication process. it is still unknown how to trigger the export of la protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for the binding with the 3'and 5' utr and regulation of viral rna synthesis.

metabolism is another function that was highlighted in one region of the sub-network comprising highly interconnected proteins .  <dig> out of  <dig> proteins  in this region function in metabolism. they include genes that express enzymes to catalyze the reactions in the biosynthesis pathway of l-arginine , aspartate, phenylalanine , isoprenoid  and tetrahydrofolate . other proteins in this region are involved in metabolic process of galactose , phosphorus , malate , lyxose , mevalonate pathway i  and arginase pathway . as a parasite, denv depends on the metabolic network of the host cell to provide the energy and macromolecule subunits necessary for their replication. consequently, host infected by the virus can produce dramatic metabolic alterations. interestingly, three proteins  that are related to lipid metabolism were found in this group. further studies are needed to study the impact of denv on mosquito metabolism, especially lipid metabolism, and the effects of host metabolic perturbation on denv replication in mosquitoes.

immunity is the third function that was highlighted in the major denv-associated sub-network. a region with highly interconnected proteins consists of the toll pathway genes and heat shock proteins . it includes rel <dig>  cact and three heat shock proteins . highlighting of this toll pathway-related proteins is consistent with our previous report that the ae. aegypti toll pathway can control dengue infection  <cit> . previous studies also show that the onyong-nyong virus induces expression of the heat shock protein cognate 70b in an. gambiae, which has an inhibitory effect on the replication of this virus  <cit> . it will be interesting to explore whether the toll pathway can regulate the expression of heat shock proteins. there are eight proteins that have never been reported to be associated with dengue infection in this region. three of them are hypothetical proteins. the others are aael <dig>  aael <dig>  aael <dig>  aael <dig> and aael <dig>  among them, aael <dig> may be related to immune defense. knock-down of its drosophila ortholog, u2af <dig>  can induce the expression of immune genes  <cit> .

fourteen highly interconnected proteins are included in the region with a main function in transport . ten of them are involved in ion transport while additional four encode tubulin alpha or beta chains, which can mediate microtubule-based movement. previous studies found that sindbis viruses induce dramatic changes in the expression of mosquito genes involved in ion transport processes  <cit> .

in the denv-associated sub-network, some neighbor proteins interact with a high number of denv-associated proteins derived from the above three datasets. these proteins are highly like to involve in denv-mosquito interactions. for example, aael <dig> is a ras-related nuclear protein  involved in the transport of large molecules across the nuclear envelope. in the sub-network, ran is connected to five putative denv-associated proteins . ribosomal protein p <dig>  is a precursor of the high affinity laminin receptor, a putative receptor for the entry of denv into host cells  <cit> . while mature laminin receptors are located on the cell surface, p <dig> has been detected in different compartments of cells, and is suggested to be a shuttle protein between the cytoplasm and the nucleus  <cit> . calreticulin  may bind to the 3'utr of denv rna  <cit> . it has to be retrotranslocated from endoplasmic reticulum lumen to cytosol for this gene regulatory function  <cit> . ran exists in the cell in two nucleotide-bound forms, rangdp and rangtp, whose concentration is controlled by the regulator of chromosome condensation  . ran interacts with importin  and exportin to change their ability to bind or release cargo molecules for the transport through the nuclear pore. the interactions of ran with these mosquito proteins suggest that ran may work together with rcc, importin, and p <dig> to redirect viral proteins to the nucleus, and then help the translocation of calreticulin, la, and other rna-binding proteins to the cytoplasm to facilitate viral genome replication. this hypothesis is supported by the previous studies indicating that ran was targeted by vesicular stomatitis virus to block transport of rnas and proteins between the nucleus and cytoplasm of xenopus laevis oocytes  <cit> . further studies are required to elucidate the roles that mosquito ran protein play in the life cycle of denv.

validation of the predicted dengue-mosquito interactions in ae. aegypti
to verify the predicted dengue-mosquito interactions, we randomly selected ten mosquito genes from the above denv-associated mosquito proteins and tested their influences on dengue infection in ae. aegypti using rnai knockdown. three days before mosquitoes were fed with dengue-infected blood, double stranded rna  of each of these genes was injected into the thorax of mosquitoes. dsrna of cact and gfp were injected as positive and negative controls, respectively. non-injected mosquitoes were used as an additional negative control. seven days post-infection, mosquito midguts were dissected and the viral titers were measured by plaque assay. as a result, silencing of five out of ten genes  led to a significant reduction of denv infection in the midgut compared to the gfp dsrna control . the anti-dengue effect was also observed in the cactus dsrna treatment. there is no significant difference in dengue titer between non-injected and gfp dsrna injected mosquitoes . these above results support the reliability of our predictions.

notably, knockdown of a putative tumor suppressor protein  led to a 13-fold decrease in denv infection in the mosquito midguts . the drosophila ortholog of aael <dig>  tsg <dig>  is the negative regulator of the jak/stat pathway and functions as a ubiquitin-protein ligase  <cit> . the jak/stat pathway has been demonstrated to be required for anti-viral defense in drosophila  <cit> . in humans, silencing of pias <dig>  the protein inhibitor of activated stat, can also reduce both denv and wnv infections  <cit> . the above results strongly suggest that the jak/stat pathway plays an important role in defense against dengue infection in mosquitoes. our previous studies also show that several important components of this pathway, including dome , were up-regulated in response to dengue infection in ae. aegypti  <cit> . thus, the jak/stat pathway might play a role in regulation of dengue infection in mosquitoes.

silencing of the other four genes, aael <dig>  aael <dig>  aael <dig> and aael <dig>  also significantly reduced the dengue infection in mosquito midguts . aael <dig> is a putative mosquito calreticulin protein, whose ortholog in human has been shown to form a complex with 3'utr in the minus-strand rna of denv  <cit> . considering that the regulatory sequences involved in viral replication reside in both ends of the flavivirus genome, it is very likely that calreticulin plays a role in the replication of denv. aael <dig> is a putative protein translocation complex beta subunit with protein transporter activity. this gene was induced in ae. aegypti in response to sindbis virus infection  <cit> . silencing of its drosophila and human ortholog, sec61β, significantly reduced the dengue infection in s <dig> cell line and huh- <dig> cells, respectively  <cit> . aael <dig> is leucine-rich transmembrane protein. similarly, its drosophila and human orthologs were proven to be required for dengue infection  <cit> . importin beta- <dig>  aael <dig>  is also a protein with transmembrane transporter activity. previous studies found that dengue virus ns <dig> is able to interact with the nuclear import receptor importin-β although the roles of this interaction is still unclear.

our rnai results indicate the notable conservation of required factors between mosquito and human hosts. as described in the above, all the five genes verified here are known to play important roles in interactions of denv with human host. it appears that common host factors present in human and mosquito, and their interactions with denv may determine the high efficiency of denv in entry and replication within these two distantly related animals. in order to maintain the transmission cycle of denv between mosquito and human, a perfect match in the cellular components and conserved denv-host interactions may be required between the two host species. our study makes the first steps towards identification of common pathways that are hijacked by denv in humans and mosquitoes. a recent study using a genome-wide rna interference screen in d. melanogaster cells found that  <dig> % of the human homolog of dengue associated insect host factors were also required for dengue infection in human  <cit> . this is consistent with our results that  <dig> % mosquito orthologs of dengue human host factors are required for its infection in mosquito.

our studies also show that the protein interaction network is a powerful tool in the study of vector biology. it can not only provide an additional tool for further annotation of vector genome, but can also serve as a novel platform to integrate datasets from different experiments in order to dissect complicated biological processes in insect vectors. by integrating the results from high-throughput assays such as genome-wide rnai screens, microarrays and yeast two-hybrid system, a protein interaction network can significantly increase prediction accuracy. moreover, multiple and concurrent signal-transduction pathways operate and are deregulated during the course of vector-pathogen interactions. such highly interconnected and temporally and spatially regulated signaling pathways can only be dissected by system-level approaches. construction of a protein interaction network can lay a foundation to study the system biology of pathogen-vector interactions, as shown in our integrated analysis of denv-associated mosquito proteins and mosquito protein interaction network.

as a first step, we used protein interactions data from model organisms to infer a mosquito protein interaction network. in order to understand the unique biological processes in mosquitoes, it is necessary to construct the network using experimental data directly from mosquitoes, such as a high-throughput yeast two-hybrid system. such an independent mosquito network will allow us to compare and contrast the network's response to dengue infection between humans and mosquitoes. this can reveal unique features of dengue-host interactions in these two species, which will help us understand why denv causes serious disease in human but no deleterious effects in the mosquito vector.

arboviruses pass through two different hosts in their life cycle, with great benefit taken from vectors for their mobility, diffusion and evolution. from an implementation standpoint, this also provides unique opportunity for identification of weak linkages in their life history to target using antiviral agents. for example, conserved denv host factors may be used as targets for anti-dengue agents for blocking dengue transmission in mosquitoes or for pharmacological intervention in humans. with the genome available, insect vectors may be used as an animal model to study the basic biology of arboviruses, and develop novel therapeutics or control strategies.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a mosquito protein interaction network based on large-scale protein interaction datasets in yeast, worm, and fly. the weighted interaction network includes  <dig>  mosquito proteins with  <dig>  interactions, among which  <dig>  proteins are connected into a single interconnected network by  <dig>  interactions. this network not only provides a valuable resource for the further annotation of the ae. aegypti genome, but also makes the first step towards studies of mosquito systems biology. in this regard, we identified a cluster of toll pathway related protein interactions, and predicted the potential link between the toll pathway, rnai pathway and expression of heat shock proteins. we then used datasets from physical interaction assays, rnai and microarray to infer ae. aegypti proteins associated with dengue infection. this led to the identification of  <dig> putative dengue-associated mosquito proteins. an integrated analysis of these proteins in the network highlighted four regions consisting of highly interconnected proteins with closely related functions in each of replication/transcription/translation , immunity, transport and metabolism. finally, by knocking down the predicted denv-associated mosquito proteins with rnai, we successfully verified that five of ten candidate genes were required for denv infection. our results support the presence of common host requirement of denv in human and mosquito.
