BACKGROUND
directional cell movement is important throughout the life cycle of multicellular organisms, from axon guidance during embryogenesis to wound healing in adults  <cit> . understanding the mechanisms by which cells move will ultimately require a detailed knowledge of the components that regulate the behaviour of force-generating cytoskeletal proteins, such as actin and myosin.

the life cycle of the social amoeba, dictyostelium discoideum, is dependent on directional cell movement. in the growth phase, amoebae are attracted to folate released from their bacterial prey  <cit> . when starved, amoebae establish a signal relay system based on camp that causes them to aggregate together into a multicellular structure. in both cases, two ras proteins, rasg and rasc, have been shown to play central roles  <cit> . the localization of activated ras to the front of the cell is one of the first responses to chemoattractant stimulation  <cit> . a recent study has shown that activation first occurs across the entire plasma membrane but progressively becomes more confined to the leading edge  <cit> . furthermore, results from a detailed analysis of ras activation in various rasgef and rasgap mutants support the idea that multiple ras isoforms, such as rasg and rasc drive chemotaxis  <cit> .

vegetative cells lacking rasg exhibit a complex phenotype; reduced growth, reduced macropinocytosis, defects in cytokinesis, a disorganized cytoskeleton, reduced motility and reduced folate chemotaxis  <cit> . removal of rasc likewise results in reduced folate chemotaxis, though the effect is somewhat milder compared to the loss of rasg  <cit> . however, when both rasg and rasc are removed in combination, the mutant cells exhibit identical phenotypes to those of rasg- cells, except that they are totally incapable of directional movement  <cit> . this suggests that rasg and rasc synergise to regulate folate chemotaxis but that rasg alone regulates cytoskeletal organization and motility  <cit> . downstream of ras activation, three pathways have been identified that are activated with similar kinetics; pi3k, torc <dig> and sgc  <cit> . furthermore, cells lacking rasg and/or rasc exhibit reduced activation of pi3k and torc <dig> pathways, presumably because effective signaling requires direct interaction between these proteins and active ras  <cit> . surprisingly, however, none of these pathways are essential for chemotaxis to folate and instead serve only accessory roles in signal amplification  <cit> . in fact, recent evidence suggests that pi3k signaling is required only for macropinocytosis, and can actively inhibit folate chemotaxis  <cit> . a more likely candidate connecting ras activation to the chemotaxis apparatus is piki, which produces pip <dig>  cells lacking this protein display normal ras activation but fail to initiate ras-dependent responses or orientate in camp gradients  <cit> . thus, while the genetic analysis of mutants is complicated by apparent redundancy between isoforms and an incomplete knowledge of the branching downstream pathways, there is a general consensus that ras plays a significant role in signaling during directional sensing and migration  <cit> . this consensus view has, however, been challenged by a recent study that has shown rasg-/rasc- mutant cells are fully capable of folate chemotaxis, although different experimental conditions were used  <cit> .

one consequence of removing rasg alone or both rasg and rasc from cells is the up-regulation of rasd  <cit> , a protein whose expression is normally restricted to the developmental stages of the dictyostelium life cycle  <cit> . rasd and rasg share 83% identity and differ by only  <dig> amino acids in the n-terminal  <dig> residues of the protein, with no variation in effector switch i or switch ii domains. it is clear that this up-regulation is insufficient to prevent the observed defective vegetative cell phenotypes of rasg- and rasg-/rasc- mutant cells. however, the addition of exogenous rasd expression rescues the growth and cytokinesis defects, but not the motility and folate chemotaxis defects of these cells  <cit> .

in this study we have directly compared folate chemotaxis in rasg-/rasc- cells, using the original experimental conditions  <cit>  and the conditions used in the more recent study  <cit> . we have confirmed that rasg is important for optimal folate chemotaxis, and have then explored, using protein chimeras of rasg and rasd, which portions of the rasg molecule contribute to folate chemotaxis.

RESULTS
requirement of ras signaling in folate chemotaxis in vegetative cells depends upon growth conditions
the recent observation indicating the absence of a role for ras proteins in folate chemotaxis  <cit>  is at odds with earlier observations that a rasg-/rasc- double knockout strain displayed zero chemotaxis towards a folate-filled micropipette  <cit> . in order to try to reconcile these conflicting results, we tested whether methodological differences between the two studies affect the chemotactic accuracy of the rasg-/rasc- cells. one important difference was that the earlier studies used cells grown axenically , while the more recent study used cells grown on bacteria. therefore, we directly compared the folate chemotaxis indices of cells cultured axenically and on bacteria.

our results showed that the mean chemotaxis index of rasg-/rasc- cells was significantly increased by the shift from axenic to bacterial growth . this result is consistent with the recent conclusion that rasg-/rasc- cells are capable of positive chemotaxis  <cit> . we noted, however, that there was still a significant reduction in folate chemotaxis between jh <dig> cells and rasg-/rasc- cells grown on bacteria . furthermore, there was negligible chemotaxis by rasg-/rasc- cells relative to control jh <dig> cells, when cells were grown axenically , supporting the earlier conclusions  <cit> . our data, therefore, indicate that ras signaling is important for optimal chemotaxis to folate regardless of growth conditions, but that this requirement is diminished by growth on bacteria.

redundancy amongst ras proteins does not explain the enhanced folate chemotaxis of bacterially grown rasg-/rasc- cells
one possible explanation for the enhanced chemotaxis phenotype of rasg-/rasc- cells is that growth on bacteria induces cellular changes that render rasg and rasc less important during folate chemotaxis compared to other ras proteins. the dictyostelium genome encodes  <dig> ras genes. of these,  <dig>  have been partially characterised, and all  have been detected by specific antibodies during the growth phase and shown to have different mobilities on electrophoresis gels  <cit> . extremely low transcript levels argue that the remaining  <dig> ras gene products are unlikely to be detectable by western blot . therefore, the levels and identities of different ras proteins can be identified using a non-specific pan-ras antibody.

firstly, there was no evidence of any novel ras isoform in the bacterially grown rasg-/rasc- cells when compared to their axenic counterparts . this result suggests that any ras-mediated improvements to folate chemotaxis would manifest as changes in the expression level of the ras proteins already present in these cells.

it has been shown previously that rasd expression is considerably enhanced when the rasg gene is deleted  <cit> , and this enhanced expression is also detected by the pan-ras antibody. rasd levels were undetectable in the jh <dig> cells but clearly present in both rasg- and rasg-/rasc- cells grown axenically and on bacteria . in addition, bacterial growth of these cells was correlated with qualitative increases in rasd levels. this increase cannot explain the improvement in folate chemotaxis of rasg-/rasc- cells observed by a switch from axenic to bacterial growth, since exogenous rasd expression does not rescue the chemotactic defects of rasg-/rasc- cells  <cit> .

surprisingly, there was a comparative decrease in rasg levels in jh <dig> cells grown on bacteria. this clearly has no impact on folate chemotaxis, since their folate chemotactic indexes are not significantly different , and may instead be related to the significant differences in growth rates between the bacterially and axenically grown cells.

finally, it is also unlikely that there are increased levels of active ras in bacterially grown rasg-/rasc- cells, because membrane recruitment of rbd-gfp remains low in cells stimulated with folate  <cit> . thus, there is no evidence that the improved chemotactic accuracy of bacterially grown rasg-/rasc- cells involves novel ras signaling pathways or the modulation of currently existing ones.

initial distance from micropipette affects folate chemotaxis of bacterially grown rasg-/rasc- cells
there is an additional difference in the folate chemotaxis measurements between the earlier and more recent studies. in the more recent study  <cit> , folate chemotaxis was measured in a field of cells that appeared to be at considerably higher cell density than was used for the earlier measurements  <cit>  and consequently the chemotactic index was measured only for cells close to the tip. chemoattractant gradients decrease exponentially at increasing distances from the tip such that cells close to the tip experience high concentrations and steep gradients of folate, whereas those further away experience lower concentrations and shallower gradients  <cit> . this has been shown to influence chemotactic measurements  <cit> . we therefore controlled for the cell density of the rasg-/rasc- cells and looked at the effect of distance from the micropipette at t <dig> on the determination of the folate chemotaxis index. as shown in figure  <dig>  individual rasg-/rasc- cells grown on bacteria displayed positive chemotaxis below an initial distance of 200 μm , but negligible levels of chemotaxis  above a distance of 200 μm. over the same distance range, jh <dig> cells grown on bacteria exhibited no variation . thus, initial distance of the cell from the micropipette is an important factor determining whether or not bacterially grown rasg-/rasc- cells will exhibit directional movement. in contrast, rasg-/rasc- cells grown axenically displayed negligible chemotaxis at all distances from the micropipette , confirming previously published data  <cit> . this result reinforces the idea that ras signaling is crucial for folate chemotaxis of axenically grown cells. furthermore, we show that ras signaling is not absolutely essential for the chemotaxis of bacterially grown cells, but that its role becomes increasingly important at either lower concentrations or shallower gradients of folate.

the above results indicate that there is a clear difference between the requirements of ras for folate chemotaxis in axenically and bacterially grown cells. there have been several reports detailing morphological, metabolic and transcriptional differences between axenically and bacterially grown cells  <cit> . there are also effects on cell motility. first, bacterially grown cells move faster than axenic cells in random motility assays  <cit> . indeed, our own measurements show that bacterially grown jh <dig> and rasg-/rasc- cells migrate at higher velocities than their axenically grown counterparts during folate chemotaxis . second, a recent study has shown that transfer of the background strain ax <dig> from axenic to bacterial growth improves chemotaxis in linear folate gradients  <cit> . in the same paper, pip3-dependent macropinocytosis, the predominant mode of feeding in amoebae grown axenically, was identified as an inhibitor of chemotaxis. we did not observe a significant difference between the chemotactic indices of jh <dig> cells grown in axenic medium or on bacteria , possibly owing to strain-specific differences. however, there was a clear difference between folate chemotaxis of axenic and bacterially grown rasg-/rasc- cells . whilst axenically grown rasg-/rasc- cells exhibit reduced macropinocytosis , there may still be sufficient activity to severely inhibit folate chemotaxis.

although the effect of macropinocytosis inhibition may explain some of our observations, it does not explain why rasg-/rasc- cells exhibit reduced chemotaxis regardless of their growth condition. one possibility is that axenically grown cells are relatively unpolarized, and only become polarized when exposed to folate gradients . ras signaling is important for initiating and reinforcing decisions to polarize the cytoskeleton  <cit>  and axenically grown rasg-/rasc- cells may be less capable of amplifying signals sufficiently to be able to orient towards the chemotactic signal. in contrast, ras-dependent amplification of the chemotactic signal in a strong folate gradient is important for optimal chemotaxis of bacterially grown rasg-/rasc- cells, but not essential. interestingly, ras signaling is still of prime importance for the bacterially grown rasg-/rasc- cells in shallow folate gradients.

specificity of the rasg requirement for optimum chemotaxis
we showed previously that exogenous expression of rasd was incapable of restoring folate chemotaxis in rasg-/rasc- cells  <cit> . to understand what makes rasg uniquely required for chemotaxis, we decided to generate chimeras of rasg and rasd that would assess the relative importance of the  <dig> amino acids in the n-terminal portion of the rasg protein and the differences in residues in the c-terminal half of the protein. for this, a pcr-based approach was used in which primers were designed to generate a product that would leave an overhanging end containing sequence to which a corresponding product could ligate. the product, designated rasd1g <dig>  corresponds to the n-terminal  <dig> residues of rasd ligated to the c-terminal  <dig> residues of rasg. the product, designated rasg1d <dig>  corresponds to the n-terminal  <dig> residues of rasg ligated to the c-terminal  <dig> residues of rasd . each of these products was cloned into an exogenous expression vector downstream of the rasg promoter and transformed into rasg-/rasc- cells. intact rasd and rasg were also transformed so that there was an experimental baseline to which our chimera data could be compared. g418-resistant clones were isolated and subjected to western blotting with specific rasd or rasg antibodies to confirm that all the proteins were expressed at similar levels .

as shown previously, expression of rasg in rasg-/rasc- cells almost fully rescued the folate chemotaxis defect, while rasd expression had a minimal effect on chemotaxis . the expression of either the rasd1g <dig> or rasg1d <dig> constructs in rasg-/rasc- cells significantly improves folate chemotaxis . however, a statistical comparison between jh <dig> cells and rasd1g <dig> and rasg1d <dig> expressing cells reveals that chemotaxis is fully restored only by rasg1d <dig> , and not rasd1g <dig> proteins . this result suggests 1) that both the  <dig> altered amino acids in the n-terminal portion and the entire c-terminal portion make important contributions to rasg-mediated chemotaxis and 2) the n-terminal portion is perhaps more important for this function than the c-terminal portion. likewise, an earlier study found that both the n-terminal and c-terminal portions of the rasc molecule were important for adenylate cyclase activation during the aggregation of starving cells towards the chemoattractant, camp  <cit> . it was suggested that both the interaction of rasc with a specific downstream effector through the n-terminal portion of the molecule and the subcellular membrane localization through its c-terminal portion were important for function. similar conclusions may be reached regarding the specificity of rasg for folate chemotaxis in vegetative cells. however, it is important to note that the differences between n-terminal portions of rasg and rasd number only  <dig> amino acids. moreover, each of these differences is conservative , and located at positions outside of the normal switch i and switch ii interaction surfaces.

understanding the functional specificity of different ras isoforms is a hurdle that must be overcome to develop efficacious inhibitors of ras signaling  <cit> . protein chimeras composed of subfamily isoforms can be used to explore portions of protein molecules that are important for specific functions. dictyostelium rasd and rasg are highly homologous to human ras proteins . therefore, an insight into what makes rasg and rasd functionally distinct from each other may open up new avenues of inquiry in higher organisms.

CONCLUSIONS
rasg is required for optimal chemotaxis, regardless of growth condition. increased initial distance from the chemoattractant source is correlated with reduced chemotactic accuracy, suggesting that rasg is particularly important for directional cell migration in weak gradients. in strong gradients, the requirement for rasg is relaxed, but only in bacterially grown cells. the role of rasg in folate chemotaxis is unique, and cannot be replaced by the 83% identical, rasd molecule. both n- and c- terminal portions of the rasg protein contribute to folate chemotaxis, suggesting that there are functionally important amino acids outside the well established switch i and switch ii interaction surfaces.
