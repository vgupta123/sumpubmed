BACKGROUND
microarray studies on non human primates  have been used to address viral pathogenesis  <cit> , neurological disorders  <cit> , development  <cit>  and phylogenetic studies  <cit> . due to the lack of species-specific microarray platforms for nhp, researchers have used genechip® platforms built using human sequence information. an underlying assumption in such studies is that transcripts of humans and nhp are highly conserved, and probe sequences designed to detect human genes will detect their orthologs in nhp samples. it is estimated that chimpanzees  and humans shared  <dig>  % dna similarity  <cit> . while this statistic is widely quoted and believed, britten  <cit>  reported that the divergence between humans and chimpanzees to be about 5%. anzai and colleagues  <cit>  compared the chimpanzee mhc region  with the human hla region , and concluded that the similarity drops to  <dig> % if insertions and deletions were taken into account. all these analyses are based on genomic dna sequences; however, for microarray studies on the transcriptome, the similarity of rna transcripts is the primary concern. a single gene does not necessarily generate a single transcript. splicing variants are very common in the human  <cit> , and humans and nhps may use different splicing strategies in some genes. therefore, it is necessary to re-assess the reliability of human genechips® for nhp expression analysis.

few published studies employing human genechip® platforms for nhp expression profiling have robustly addressed the quantitative aspects of cross platform performance. vahey and colleagues  <cit>  used the hugenefl genechip® and demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the dynamic range of the raw fluorescence distribution for equivalent amounts of human crna and macaque crna hybridized to the chip. chismar and colleagues  <cit>  used the u95av <dig> genechip® platform and compared the expression patterns of humans with that of the rhesus macaque. they concluded that the percentage of 'present' calls observed in the transcriptome of macaque brain is lower than that of human brain, and that this is especially true for genes with lower signal intensity. caceres and colleagues  <cit>  used the hg-u95av <dig> arrays to identify upregulated genes in the human cortex compared with those of the nhps. since sequence divergence could lead to an underestimation of expression levels in nhps, they excluded  <dig> probes that exhibited different hybridization behaviour between two sets of samples in order to reduce false positives. however, this analysis is solely based on probe signal intensities. a more robust way to assess the utility of human genechip® platforms for the study of expression profiles in nhp is to employ a sequence analysis approach.

in this study, we address the power of human genechip® platforms to assess expression patterns in nhp samples by: a) identifying isc probesets based on sequence analysis; b) assessing intra - and interspecies  reproducibility of genechip® data; and c) applying appropriate normalization methods to improve interspecies reproducibility.

RESULTS
identification of isc probesets
when a probe sequence on the human genechip® hybridizes with the transcriptome of a nhp, there are three possible outcomes: 1) it hybridizes with the ortholog of the nhp; 2) it cross-hybridizes with a non-ortholog transcript, or 3) it fails to hybridize due to sequence divergence. in affymetrix genechip® system, a probeset is composed of 11– <dig> probes and each probe is a 25-mer oligo. we identified probes on the human genechip that are complementary to ests in nhp postulating that these probes would hybridize most optimally with the transcripts of nhp. we defined a probeset as an isc probeset if it had at least two complementary probes. the rationale used to define the criterion that defines an isc probeset is described in the methods section. the procedure used to generate isc probesets is shown in figure  <dig> and described in methods section. isc probesets in each of the seven affymetrix human genechip® platforms  were generated for both monkey and chimpanzee. detailed information about each isc probeset such as probe sequence, genbank accession and the position and degree of matching is provided in the supplemental materials . table  <dig> displays a summary of the statistical characteristics of isc probesets. not surprisingly, there were more isc probesets for monkey  than for chimpanzee . this is not because monkey est sequences are more similar to human sequences than chimpanzee est sequences, but because we have a much greater amount of est sequences available for monkey. at the time of writing this manuscript, there were  <dig>  monkey ests available, while there were only  <dig>  ests available for chimpanzee. as the number of defined ests will increase in the future, additional isc probesets could be identified for both monkey and chimpanzee using this method.

* refer to the number of unique unigene clusters.

it is not uncommon, especially in the u133plus <dig>  platform, that multiple probesets target the same gene. for example, in the u133a and the u <dig> plus  <dig>  genechip®s, there are three probesets  that target the gene cxcr <dig> at different positions in its transcript. in order to address this redundancy issue, we converted the number of probesets into the number of unique unigene clusters based on the genechip® annotation file provided by affymetrix website  <cit> . while a unigene cluster does not necessarily correspond to a unique gene, it is a reasonable way to assess probeset redundancy. as shown in table  <dig>  the focus genechip® and the u133plus <dig>  genechip® have the lowest and highest frequency of redundant probesets for a given gene, respectively.

the u133plus <dig>  is the most current version of human genechip® from affymetrix and covers the human genome most extensively. figure  <dig> displays the distribution of probesets on the human chromosomes. the yellow bars represent the distribution of all probesets on the u133plus <dig>  platform, and the blue and red bars represent the distribution of isc probesets for monkey and chimpanzee, respectively. as shown in figure  <dig>  isc probesets for both monkey and chimpanzee are distributed throughout the genome, from chromosome  <dig> to chromosome  <dig>  including the two sex chromosomes x and y. the percentage of isc probesets on each chromosome is roughly proportional to that of the total probesets.

intra- and interspecies reproducibility of detection calls
the qualitative detection call  output from mas <dig>  was the initial approach used to examine the reproducibility of genechip® data observed in intra- and interspecies samples. the intra-species reproducibility is displayed in figure 3a and 3b for human samples and monkey samples, respectively. as shown in figure 3a, 66% of probesets showed 100% reproducibility across  <dig> human replicates, being either present in all samples  or absent in all samples . similarly, among  <dig> monkey samples, 69% of probesets showed 100% reproducibility, being either present in all samples  or absent in all samples  . although the percentage of absent calls in monkey samples  is higher than those in human samples , the detection call itself is consistent across replicates. in other words, an absent call caused by sequence divergence will be reliably repeated across monkey samples. this result suggests that it is feasible to use the human genechip® for nhp intra-species studies.

in contrast, if human genechip® platforms are used to compare the expression pattern of humans with those of nhps, care must be taken in the interpretation of data. if we consider a probeset as being expressed when 50% or more of replicates have present calls, then  <dig>  and  <dig>  probesets are expressed in the pbmc fraction of humans and monkeys, respectively . approximately 40%  of probesets being detected in human pbmcs are not detected in the monkey. due to the close evolutionary relationship between human and monkey, one would not expect that 40% of genes expressed in human pbmcs are not expressed in monkey pbmcs. this observation suggests that a subset of human probesets failed to properly hybridize with the orthologs of monkey. based on expression data alone, however, it is difficult to distinguish a genuine absent call from a spurious absent call resulting from sequence divergence. isc probesets can help to distinguish spurious from genuine absent calls. as shown in figure 4b, of  <dig> isc probesets that were detected in human pbmcs, only  <dig>  are not detected in monkey pbmcs. the interspecies discordance is reduced significantly for isc probesets . it is important to point out that isc probesets will significantly reduce, but not eliminate interspecies discordance as it requires only a minimum of two complementary probes. it can be postulated that a perfect probeset in which all of its probes were complementary to ests of nhp would provide the ultimate reduction in discordance. however, the identification of such probesets is limited by currently available sequence information.

intra- and interspecies reproducibility of signal intensities
to assess the intra- and interspecies reproducibility of genechip® signal intensities, a matrix that contains signal intensities of  <dig> expressed probesets across  <dig> samples  was created. probesets that are not expressed in human pbmcs were excluded in this analysis. pair-wise correlation coefficients were calculated for all  <dig> samples . the correlation coefficients were visualized using heat spectrum graphs where colors ranging from red to white correspond to correlation coefficients of  <dig>  to  <dig> , respectively. in figure 5a, the cells in the diagonal line are all white as they represent samples correlating with themselves with a correlation coefficient of  <dig> . the highest correlations were found among human replicates , followed by monkey replicates . the lowest correlations were found in interspecies comparisons . the means and standard deviations of human-human, monkey-monkey and human-monkey correlation coefficients are  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively. if the low correlation coefficients of human-monkey are caused by unsuitable probesets, then isc probesets should have higher correlation coefficients. figure 5b displayed the correlation coefficients of the same  <dig> samples as figure 5a, but limited to isc probesets. as shown in fig 5b, the colors are much less red than those in figure 5a, indicating higher correlation coefficients. the means and standard deviations of correlation coefficients of isc probesets for human-human, monkey-monkey and human-monkey are  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively. the greatest improvement  in correlation coefficients are observed in the human-monkey comparison  using the isc probesets. this data suggests that a subset of problematic probesets interfered with interspecies comparison, and the isc probesets could be used to improved interspecies reproducibility.

the effect of normalization methods on interspecies reproducibility
different normalization methods have been shown to significantly affect genechip® data variation  <cit> . we compared three different normalization methods: mas <dig> , rma  <cit>  and dchip  <cit> , to evaluate the effect of normalization methods on interspecies reproducibility. both rma and dchip methods normalize genechip® data at the probe level using a non-linear algorithm while mas <dig>  normalizes data at probeset level using linear scaling. sequence divergence usually leads to one or very few probes in a probeset being problematic while the majority of probes in that probeset may still work reasonably well. if the variation generated from these problematic probes were normalized, the interspecies reproducibility should improve. figure  <dig> showed the interspecies correlation coefficients using three different normalization methods. the average signal intensities of  <dig> monkey samples were given on the ordinate and that of  <dig> human samples on the abscissa. the rma normalization method improved interspecies reproducibility the most for both expressed probesets and isc probesets. as shown in the figure 6a,6b,6c, correlation coefficients for expressed probesets using mas <dig> , dchip and rma were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. similarly, in figure 6d,6e,6f, correlation coefficients for isc probesets using mas <dig> , dchip and rma were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. for the same normalization method, isc probesets exhibited higher correlation coefficients than those of expressed probesets . use of the rma normalization method in conjunction with the use of isc probesets optimized the correlation coefficient between human and monkey. the resulting correlation coefficient of  <dig>  is equivalent to the human-human correlation using the mas <dig>  normalization method .

CONCLUSIONS
this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of probe sequences and genechip® expression data as applied to the derivation of meaningful expression profile data from nhp. the utility of the human affymetrix genechip® for the assessment of expression profiles in nhp depends on the experimental design and on the approach to data normalization and analysis. our observations suggest that: 1) it is feasible to use the human genechip® in the evaluation of expression profiles of nhp samples for intra-species comparisons; 2) use of isc probesets and rma normalization are recommended for interspecies studies; and 3) with the increasing amount of ests of nhp, additional isc probesets  will be identified in the near future.
