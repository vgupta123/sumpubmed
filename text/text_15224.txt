BACKGROUND
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded  tissue samples are routinely used for diagnosis of disease. there is increasing interest in extracting rna from these samples as the large numbers of archival ffpe samples constitute an invaluable resource for the investigation of diagnostic, prognostic or predictive disease associated alterations in gene expression . furthermore, these often represent the only diagnostic material available.

however, rna extracted from ffpe specimens is extensively degraded and chemically modified, which compromises its use in pcr based applications . degradation of rna is influenced by the time and storage conditions between sample collection and formalin fixation, the fixation process, and the conditions and length of the subsequent storage  <cit> . chemical modifications of rna are caused by formaldehyde and result in the addition of mono-methylol groups to rna bases and subsequently in the formation of methylene bridges between rna bases  <cit> , and rna-protein cross-links  <cit> . the addition of the mono-methylol group is in principal reversible, but a considerable amount is still present after rna purification  <cit> .

whereas the extent of chemical modifications of the rna initially limits the pcr amplification size, with time rna degradation becomes more important in determining the size of amplifiable pcr fragments  <cit> . the rna fragment sizes from ffpe tissue are usually less than  <dig> bp and may be less than  <dig> bp  <cit> .

the quality of the extracted rna is a critical factor for both microarray based and reverse transcription - quantitative real-time pcr  gene expression experiments. microarray based approaches are more sensitive to rna degradation and chemical modifications  <cit> , which potentially influence the gene expression data  <cit> .

rt-qpcr assays are less affected by rna degradation and chemical modifications especially when the rt-qpcr amplicon size is less than  <dig> bp  <cit> . it is nevertheless an essential prerequisite to characterise the quality of the extracted rna prior to its use in a gene expression study to evaluate its suitability for the planned application and to minimise data misinterpretation  <cit> .

rna quality is often defined in terms of rna purity and rna integrity. rna purity is spectrophotometrically determined by the a260/a <dig> and a260/a <dig> absorbance ratios  <cit> . both ratios are used to evaluate the level of contaminants such as proteins and residual organic compounds present in a rna sample. these values provide no information about rna degradation and amplifiable pcr amplicon sizes.

rna integrity evaluates the level of rna degradation and several methods have been developed for rna integrity assessment. two of the most commonly used approaches are suitable for assessing moderately degraded rna but not highly degraded rna.

the first approach investigates the ratio between the 28s and 18s ribosomal rna bands and presumes that the integrity of ribosomal rna reflects the integrity of mrna  <cit> . the typical rna fragment sizes of less than  <dig> bp make this methodology unsuitable for highly degraded rna from ffpe samples  <cit> . furthermore, this approach does not take chemical modifications of the rna into account and provides no information on how the extracted rna performs in rt-pcr.

the second approach has been adopted from a common practice in microarray experiments  <cit>  and determines the mrna integrity by utilising rt-qpcr assays to assess the 3':5' ratio of a gene target sequence, such as gapdh  <cit>  or actb  <cit> . these assays need to reach a considerable fragment size  to calculate the 3':5' ratio, which makes this methodology unsuitable for highly degraded rna from ffpe samples. moreover, the 3':5' assays utilise an oligo-dt primer for cdna preparation, which precludes the cdna obtained from being used in the majority of rt-pcr assays, an important factor when the amount of rna is often limited.

the third approach assesses a range of fragment sizes generated by  endpoint rt-pcr assays for certain reference  genes, such as g6pd, tbp, hprt and actb  <cit> . this approach takes both fragmentation and chemical modifications of the rna into account and determines the pcr amplicon sizes, which might be obtained in a pcr based application. when the pcr amplicon sizes cover a range from less than  <dig> bp to several hundred base pairs, this methodology is suitable to assess the extent of the degradation of rna extracted from ffpe tissues.

in this study, we sought to combine the best features of assays from the third approach to develop a readily performable endpoint rt-pcr assay to assess rna extracted from ffpe samples for mrna integrity and rna performance in rt-qpcr assays.

the assay utilises the tbp  reference gene mrna as the target sequence. tbp has been shown to be relatively stably expressed in a range of tissues  <cit>  and various tumour types . four different amplicon sizes are amplified in parallel in a single tube from cdna  to minimise the consumption of what are often limited amounts of rna. the amplicon sizes chosen cover a range of up to  <dig> bp and are therefore tailored to the fragment size limitations typically observed for rna extracted from ffpe samples and pcr amplicon sizes usually used for the vast majority of rt-qpcr assays.

our improved multiplex endpoint rt-pcr assay is a robust and convenient method which overcomes the limitations of current approaches for the quality assessment of rna extracted from ffpe specimens. the assay has been thoroughly validated by assessing the quality of  <dig> rna samples extracted from ffpe tissues with an rt-qpcr assay.

RESULTS
assessment of total rna yield and purity using optical density
the amount of total rna extracted for each of the samples was measured by a nanodrop nd- <dig> spectrophotometer and is shown for each sample replicate in figure  <dig>  the estimated mean total rna extracted for protocol  <dig> was  <dig>  μg  with values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg . for protocol  <dig>  the estimated mean concentration was  <dig>  μg  with values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μg .

the corresponding absorbance ratio a260/a <dig> for each sample replicate is shown in figure  <dig>  the mean a260/a <dig> ratio for protocol  <dig> was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and for protocol  <dig>  <dig>  ±  <dig> . the desired ratio a260/a <dig> is in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  and is dependent on the extraction conditions  <cit> .

the use of the multiplex endpoint rt-pcr for assessment of mrna integrity
the integrity of the mrna extracted from each sample was assessed by the multiplex endpoint rt-pcr assay using the tbp  mrna  as the target sequence . the assay was designed to amplify four amplicons of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp in parallel in a single tube .

the amplicons were designed to be amplified from cdna but not genomic dna . this is of particular importance for assessing cdna synthesised from total rna, which has not been treated with dnase. we used primer pairs where the primers were in exons spanning one or more introns . furthermore, the primer locations were chosen to exclude known polymorphic sites from the primer binding sites.

the results for protocols  <dig> and  <dig> are summarised in figures  <dig> and  <dig> for each sample replicate. in general, the least degraded rna was extracted from the year  <dig> samples for both protocols . in addition, the vast majority of sample replicates of both protocols amplified the  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp pcr fragments .

assessment of mrna performance by rt-qpcr
the performance of the mrna extracted from each sample was assessed by a rt-qpcr assay also using the tbp mrna as the target sequence . the rt-qpcr assay was designed and optimised to be monitored using hydrolysis probes from the universal probe library  library in combination with gene-specific primers  <cit> . the assay amplifies an amplicon of  <dig> bp from cdna using an intron-spanning primer pair. the quantification cycle   <cit>  values obtained for each sample replicate in the rt-qpcr assay were used to estimate the quantity of amplifiable template.

each sample replicate was classified into one of three different groups based on the cq values measured  . the cq value is inversely proportional to the number of amplifiable templates. a cq value of  <dig> is generally considered as the limit for the detection of a single copy template  <cit> . a cq value above  <dig> thus represents less than one copy template present and can be considered as background noise of the rt-qpcr assay  <cit> . a theoretical cq value of  <dig> represents approximately  <dig> copies of the target template.

samples from years  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were analysed by each of the two protocols. each sample of protocol  <dig>  and  <dig>  was separated into three groups .

eighty seven percent  of samples extracted by protocol  <dig> and 80%  of samples isolated by protocol  <dig> showed cq values less than  <dig>  for the tbp rt-qpcr assay . therefore, cdna prepared from rna extracted with protocol  <dig> might had slightly more amplifiable templates per sample volume than cdna prepared from total rna extracted with protocol  <dig> 

comparison of the multiplex endpoint rt-pcr and rt-qpcr assays
the results from the multiplex endpoint rt-pcr assay were validated by the results obtained from the rt-qpcr assay and allowed the identification of ffpe samples with an adequate rna quality.

almost all the samples  that amplified the pcr fragments more than  <dig> bp in the multiplex endpoint rt-pcr assay amplified the  <dig> bp product at cq values less than  <dig>  in the rt-qpcr assay consistent with a greater amount of amplifiable template .

six percent  of the samples did not amplify in the multiplex endpoint rt-pcr assay . consistent with this, the absence of the  <dig> bp amplicon was associated with late amplification in the rt-qpcr assay with a cq value later than  <dig>  .

in some cases, stochastic effects due to the very small number of available templates, can give inconsistent results; e.g. for one of the replicates of sample p2-08- <dig>  the  <dig> bp amplicon did not amplify in the multiplex endpoint rt-pcr assay but showed a band for the  <dig> bp product . the other replicates showed a  <dig> bp band and band sizes up to the  <dig> bp amplicon, respectively. all three replicates showed cq values in the rt-qpcr assay above  <dig>   indicating that on average less than one copy of template was present.

we saw no ffpe samples that gave robust amplification for the  <dig> bp amplicon. forty six percent  of the samples prepared by protocol  <dig> amplified all the amplicons up to  <dig> bp in the multiplex endpoint rt-pcr assay . these samples showed a mean cq value in the rt-qpcr assay of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  with values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . for protocol  <dig>  33%  of the samples amplified the amplicons up to  <dig> bp and showed a mean cq value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  with values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .

correlations between a longer amplicon size in the multiplex endpoint rt-pcr assay and the appropriate cq value obtained in rt-qpcr were evaluated by calculating the spearman correlation coefficient. we found an inverse correlation for both parameters for protocols  <dig> and  <dig> . thus, a longer fragment size in the multiplex endpoint rt-pcr assay was correlated with a smaller cq value in the rt-qpcr assay for both total rna extraction protocols .

interestingly, both the multiplex endpoint rt-pcr and the rt-qpcr assay show that the samples prepared from  <dig> performed best during pcr amplification. all  <dig> samples from  <dig> extracted by protocols  <dig> and  <dig> amplified pcr amplicons up to  <dig> bp in the multiplex endpoint rt-pcr assay . furthermore, all of these samples also amplified the  <dig> bp amplicon with cq values less than  <dig>  in the rt-qpcr assay . the lack of correlation between age of the ffpe samples and rna quality has been reported previously  <cit> . this may be explained by a difference in the processing of the samples, such as pre-fixation time, fixation time and storage conditions over the course of time  <cit> . the variation in pcr fragment sizes present in each sample replicate was also the least in the samples prepared in year  <dig> compared to samples prepared from the years  <dig> and  <dig>  consistent with a minimisation of stochastic effects caused by greater amounts of template. the effect of sample age needs further investigation.

discussion
there has been an increasing demand for reliable methods and protocols for the extraction of rna from ffpe tissue sections. the performance of rna preparation protocols has improved over the years and specific protocols for certain rna downstream applications have been developed .

despite the improvements in methodologies for extracting rna from ffpe specimens, one significant and challenging problem still remains. the quality of the extracted rna is compromised and the degree of rna degradation and the extent of chemical modifications of the rna may limit its use in downstream applications. it is therefore critical to assess the rna quality at the cdna stage to identify the rna preparations which are suitable for a particular rt-qpcr analysis.

the multiplex endpoint rt-pcr approach used in this study has been developed and optimised to assess rna extracted from ffpe specimens for its use in rt-qpcr assays. the assay is sensitive to rna degradation as well as chemical modifications, which both determine the length of an amplicon during pcr amplification. this methodology is similar in principle to one that has been used extensively in our laboratory for the assessment of dna from ffpe samples  <cit> .

the choice of the target gene mrna is of particular importance. it is desirable, that the target gene mrna is ubiquitously expressed across most cell types and that the level of gene expression shows a similar magnitude among the samples. we selected tbp for our multiplex endpoint rt-pcr assay, because it was shown to be relatively stably expressed in a range of tumour types such as bladder cancer  <cit> , renal cell carcinoma  <cit> , hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit> , glioma  <cit>  and breast cancer  <cit> . tbp is expressed at moderate  <cit>  to low levels  <cit> . the choice of a highly expressed target gene mrna might result in an increased false negative rate for less abundant mrnas in gene expression studies, due to an insufficient amount of starting material for pcr amplification. this is supported by a study, which showed that only a limited proportion of the rna extracted from ffpe tissues is actually accessible for cdna synthesis  <cit> .

we also designed our primers to avoid underlying polymorphic sites. target gene mrna from highly polymorphic genes perhaps should be avoided. the primers in a previous approach which used the g6pd gene actually overlie potential polymorphic sites  <cit> . primer binding sites which contain polymorphic sites will lead to impaired or even absent pcr amplification of the mismatched alleles.

our multiplex endpoint rt-pcr approach utilises random primers to synthesise cdna. thus after the cdna is assessed, the same cdna can subsequently be used in the final gene expression experiment. this then also controls for the cdna synthesis step.

the knowledge about which fragment sizes can be amplified during a rt-qpcr assay helps to identify samples suitable for gene expression analysis and which amplicon sizes can be used for an rt-qpcr assay design. the range of pcr amplicon sizes covered by our assay takes into account the rna sizes normally obtained from ffpe. the upper size range is interrogated by three pcr amplicon sizes , and helps to identify samples suitable for sometimes more demanding applications, such as discrimination between gene splice variants. the  <dig> bp pcr fragment helps to identify samples suitable for ffpe-friendly rt-qpcr assays which we normally design with amplicon sizes less than  <dig> bp.

the good agreement between the results observed for the multiplex endpoint rt-pcr assay and the rt-qpcr results  shows that this assay can identify ffpe samples suitable for gene expression studies. the ten samples, which did not amplify in the multiplex endpoint rt-pcr assay amplified all very late in the rt-qpcr assay and would normally have been excluded from further analysis. the  <dig> samples, which showed amplification of all the amplicon sizes up to  <dig> bp in the multiplex endpoint rt-pcr assay amplified with moderate cq values in the rt-qpcr assay and are probably the best suited samples to deliver reliable gene expression data for most genes of interest in gene expression analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
there is an increasing demand for the use of rna from ffpe both in research and in molecular diagnostic applications such as the oncotype dx test  <cit> . this is accompanied by a need for reliable methodologies to assess the quality of ffpe derived rna. most of the approaches currently used for rna quality control are not suitable or have a limited usage for the assessment of such challenging material.

the validated quality control multiplex endpoint rt-pcr assay presented here overcomes the limitations of current approaches and is a robust method and well suited for determining the quality of a rna preparation, especially for ffpe derived rna. in addition, the assay can be used for routine quality control assessment of cdna synthesis. the assay is also applicable for comparing or refining methodologies for rna extraction and cdna synthesis. finally, the approach is cost effective and only requires equipment which is widely available.
