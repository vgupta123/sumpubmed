BACKGROUND
the role copy number variants  play in genomic processes spanning from evolution , through population genetic diversity  and disease susceptibility  <cit>  is under constant investigation. whilst cnvs are less common than single nucleotide polymorphisms , these genomic gains and losses are more likely to have an impact on phenotypic diversity  <cit> . one of the key mechanisms of action for cnvs is through the disruption of gene or regulatory element dosage, leading to perturbed gene expression. in order to dissect the impact these structural variants play, it is essential that they be accurately detected and quantified. methods such as fluorescence in situ hybridisation , multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification  and array comparative genomic hybridisation  can all be used to detect copy number variants, but the establishment of mode of transmission or genotype may fall to alternate pcr based methods such as quantitative pcr , or more recently, droplet digital pcr .

the detection of canine cnvs has advanced dramatically from the first array cgh which revealed  <dig> variants  <cit> , through to a catalogue of more than  <dig>  polymorphisms which have been assayed in both domestic dogs and a variety of members from the canidae family . through these studies and others , we have gained insight into what sets domestic dogs apart from their wild ancestors  and an understanding of dog phenotypic diversity and disease susceptibility . the link between genotype and phenotype relies not only on the ability to identify cnvs, but also on the accuracy of variant quantification. if the cnv is to be used diagnostically, the importance of the latter cannot be overestimated.

this study focuses on two breed specific cnvs found in the chinese shar-pei; the “traditional”  variant and the “meatmouth”  variant, located in an overlapping region of chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . it has been reported that a high copy number of the  <dig>  kb variant is associated with the increased expression of hyaluronan synthase  <dig> , the driver of long-chain hyaluronan  synthesis  <cit> . the elevated expression of has <dig> results in cutaneous hyaluronosis, creating the shar-pei’s distinctive thickened and folded skin . the increased copy number of the  <dig>  kb variant was also shown to be significantly correlated to the occurrence of a breed specific fever syndrome  <cit> . it was hypothesised that the recurring fever followed the cyclical over production and subsequent degradation of ha and that low molecular weight ha was acting as a danger associated molecular pattern  triggering the release of inflammatory interleukins  <cit> .

more recently it was reported that this fever syndrome was actually one of a spectrum of clinical signs including arthritis, ear  and skin  inflammation and amyloidosis that were encompassed by the larger shar-pei autoinflammatory disease   <cit> . in a genetic study which utilised  <dig> carefully phenotyped individuals, genome wide association analyses showed that the five clinical signs of spaid overlapped one genetic locus; a region which also encompassed has <dig> and both the  <dig>  kb and the  <dig>  kb copy number variants  <cit> .

when the  <dig>  kb and the  <dig>  kb cnvs were first measured, the methodology employed was quantitative pcr   <cit> . this was a primer-limited multiplex qpcr where the result of an unknown individual was calibrated to the result of an individual with known diploid copy number . the error in this measurement was therefore a composite of the errors from four pcr reactions  and quadruplet replications. when applied to the  <dig>  kb variant this resulted in a continuum of copy number estimates, from two to fifteen or more  <cit> . an alternative to qpcr is droplet digital pcr . in the latter case, restriction digested dna and a multiplex pcr mix are evenly partitioned across many thousands of oil droplets. after the completion of thermocycling, the initial concentration of template dna is determined from the poisson distribution of positive  and negative  reaction droplets  <cit> . results comparing the two pcr methodologies have generally shown gains in precision and reproducibility when using ddpcr versus qpcr  although, as noted by others, this can come at an increased cost per reaction  <cit> .

with the recent advancement in defining shar-pei autoinflammatory disease and the availability of alternate methods of quantifying copy number variants, the aims of the current study were three-fold, i) to identify a reliable cnv measurement method , ii) to apply that method to investigate the relationship between cnv load, the occurrence of spaid and spaid sub-phenotypes and iii) to assess the utility of cnv variants as a genetic test for spaid.

RESULTS
droplet digital pcr has reduced variability compared to quantitative pcr
copy numbers were measured for  <dig> shar-pei  with three assays  and two methodologies, droplet digital pcr  and quantitative pcr . the relationship between assays and methodologies is illustrated in fig.  <dig>  the linear correlation between methodologies was found to be the highest for cnv-east , followed by cnv- <dig>  and was the lowest for cnv-e . the value for cnv_ <dig>  as measured by assay-cnv-east was on average  <dig>  cnvs smaller when measured by ddpcr than qpcr. for cnv_ <dig>  the pattern was discordant with cnv measures on average  <dig>  and  <dig>  larger , when measured with ddpcr compared to qpcr. whilst qpcr cnv measures for one individual were not always in agreement between assay-cnv- <dig> and assay-cnv-e , they were in extremely close agreement when measured with ddpcr . examples of these inconsistencies in qpcr compared to ddpcr at an individual level are illustrated in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  from this point forward, the results of assay-cnv- <dig> and assay-cnv-e will be presented as the result for cnv_ <dig> , as the former were interchangeable.fig.  <dig>

breed specific cnvs are stable and inherited in a bi-allelic fashion
ddpcr showed clearly that the results for both cnv_ <dig>  and cnv_ <dig>  formed three clusters  suggesting that these copy number variants may be acting as stably inherited alleles. we tested this hypothesis in extended pedigrees  and found that this was in fact true. cnv_ <dig>  was demonstrated to have two alleles comprising either  <dig> or  <dig> copies and for cnv_ <dig> , alleles of  <dig> or  <dig> copies were shown. for the full set of individuals included in the study , no alternate combinations were observed.fig.  <dig> an example pedigree illustrates the segregation of cnv alleles across generations. the second generation shows a distribution that is in keeping with mendelian segregation. cnv results are coded to reflect the number of alleles per chromosome. using the male in generation one as an example, the result for cnv_ <dig>   is written above that for cnv_ <dig>  



a pattern of cnv genotype segregation was observed whereby cnv_ <dig>  = 2/cnv_ <dig>  =  <dig> accounted for  <dig>  % of the cnv pairs, followed by cnv_ <dig>  = 4/cnv_ <dig>  =  <dig>  and cnv_ <dig>  = 6/cnv_ <dig>  =  <dig> . however we also recorded the following pairs, cnv_ <dig>  = 4/cnv_ <dig>  =  <dig>  and cnv_ <dig>  = 2/cnv_ <dig>  =  <dig> .

cnv_ <dig>  is associated with increased has <dig> expression and spaid risk
olsson et al.,  <cit>  showed that the expression of genes has <dig> and hasas increased with increasing cnv_ <dig>  copy number. this experiment was replicated using their gene expression measures and new ddpcr calculations of copy number for the assayed fibroblast dna. the same trend of increased gene expression with cnv_ <dig>  copy number was observed .

the ddpcr method provided the resolution required to demonstrate that both duplications were stably transmitted. in order to assess disease correlation, phenotype positive and negative genotype and allele counts were made , and 2x <dig> allele risk- and odds- ratio calculations performed . as reported above,  <dig>  % of duplication pairs form the pattern of cnv_ <dig>  = 10/cnv_ <dig>  =  <dig>  this was patterned carried forward to table  <dig>  where a high proportion both cnv_ <dig>  =  <dig> and cnv_ <dig>  =  <dig> were recorded in affected individuals in each disease set. it was shown previously that cnv_ <dig>  and cnv_ <dig>  are breed specific variants, and that a copy number of two is observed at both genomic locations in all other breeds  <cit> . we therefore assessed the link between cnv_ <dig>  and disease, and not cnv_ <dig> .table  <dig> genotype and allele counts for the age limited spaid cohort and each subphenotype thereina



athe proportion of each cohort  was, spaid , fever , arthritis , vesicular hyaluronosis , otitis . bspaid negative is equivalent to c <dig>  camyloidosis  is not age limited, rather a negative result was determined by post-mortem histopathology


ac <dig> and not c <dig>  allele counts were used for the comparison to the amyloidosis subphenotype as c <dig> individuals were not all assessed for the absence of amyloid deposits in kidney tissues. fisher two tailed exact probability test was used to calculate significance using allele counts from table 1




as reported in table  <dig>  the cnv_ <dig>  allele  <dig>  is the variant highly significantly associated to spaid , and confered a greater than four fold increase in odds-ratio . similar odds ratios were noted for four of the five phenotypes of spaid, but not for amyloidosis.

cnv_ <dig>  is predictive of disease risk
the utility of cnv_ <dig>  and cnv_ <dig>  in a genetic test for spaid was evaluated using random forest   <cit>  and j <dig> decision trees  <cit> . given the low membership of c <dig> , a comparison with c <dig>  was also calculated. the best model was generated using the data set containing the allelic information from both cnvs and the maximum number of participants , although the performance of all models compared using the c <dig> control group were similar .table  <dig> the comparison of two classification models of spaid using alternate control groupsa



atwo control groups were considered. control  <dig>  contained all dogs free from spaid, irrespective of age, whilst control  <dig>  included only those individuals older than 60 months with no signs of spaid. the counts required to calculate the receiver operator curve  area are reported, including true positive  and false positive 



local genomic architecture may explain lower than expected auc
in the genome wide association analysis  of spaid, olsson et al.  <cit>  noted high linkage disequilibrium  across the genomic regions associated with all five spaid sub-phenotypes. a gwas was repeated with the addition of cnv_ <dig>  as a biallelic marker to the genome wide set. with our reduced cohort  and the same methodology as reported previously  <cit> , we found that whilst not reaching genome-wide significance , the cnv marker explained approximately 10 % of the genetic variance  and close to 25 % of the genetic heritability .

discussion
we assessed the ability of two pcr methods, quantitative pcr  and droplet digital pcr , to accurately quantify two breed specific cnvs in relation to the susceptibility of shar-pei autoinflammatory disease . we found that whilst disease association remained highly significant whether the cnv assays were measured with either qpcr or ddpcr , only ddpcr allowed for the true bi-allelic pattern of inheritance to be followed. in fact, ddpcr also revealed that whilst cnv pairs were typically inherited in a predictable manner, e.g. cnv_ <dig>  =  <dig> copies with cnv_ <dig>  =  <dig> copies), recombination does occur at this part of the genome and other combinations of results are observable, albeit at a much lower frequency. the continuum of cnv values we observed when using the qpcr method has also been noted by others using similar means  <cit> . it is likely that their ability to resolve copy number alleles would also improve with ddpcr. this point is extremely important in the context of genetic testing and future breeding programs.

the reasons as to why ddpcr was able to more clearly resolve copy number in this setting may simply be due to the mechanics of that method versus qpcr. for example, in our hands and with a subset of  <dig> samples, we generated and read approximately  <dig>  droplets per individual tested. of those accepted droplets,  <dig>  on average contained the vic labelled reference pcr product which equates to  <dig>  separate c7orf28b 90 bp pcr products . this is in comparison to the four pcr replicates that were measured for qpcr. the number of fam droplets is dependent on the number of  <dig>  kb or  <dig>  kb segments and so averaging this value was not appropriate. there are also differences in the way the two methods estimate errors and also cnv results, e.g. the normalisation to a reference individual for the delta delta ct method of qpcr versus absolute concentration calculation of ddpcr  <cit> .

however, the differences in copy number results  may also be a reflection of the architecture in surveyed genome region. it is known that pcr can be more challenging in gc rich regions, but this does not seem to be a contributing factor in this case. both shar-pei copy number elements, and the 100 kb region encompassing them, are estimated to slightly less than the average gc content for dog and a set of primates . it seems more likely that there are complex secondary structure issues that are resolved when the target genomic dna is digested into small five kb blocks as part of the ddpcr protocol. this may facilitate easier primer binding and product elongation.

shar-pei autoinflammatory disease  is both a phenotypically and genetically complex condition  <cit> . the  <dig>  kb cnv is the marker most associated with disease, explaining 25 % of the genetic heritability in the studied population, however it is the interplay between this genomic region and as yet other undiscovered genes, plus the effect of the dog’s environment, that ultimately determines that individual’s clinical disease status.

in summary, carrying the cnv_ <dig> | <dig> allele will increase a dog’s odds of developing disease by four-fold , but this predictive measure does not mean that the same carrier will present with clinical disease, be it fever, arthritis, otitis, vesicular hyaluronosis or amyloidosis. for that reason, we would suggest that the results of the cnv_ <dig>  measurement be used to inform mating strategies, preferentially breeding a homozygous cnv_ <dig> | <dig> individual  with either a cnv_ <dig>  heterozygote  or cnv_ <dig> | <dig> homozygote . however, there appear to be very few cnv_ <dig> | <dig> homozygotes  in the general population; we found only  <dig> within our tested set of  <dig> shar-pei. whilst it may seem prudent to use these individuals widely in order to quickly reduce the number of homozygous cnv_ <dig> | <dig> dogs, this may have dire results for the breed. the overuse of cnv_ <dig> | <dig> homozygotes could serve to reduce the overall genetic diversity of the breed and perhaps even enrich for as yet unknown diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
these results clearly illustrate the potential for ddpcr to quantify the true count of alleles at cnvs. this gain of precision revealed a previously unknown pattern of allele segregation for two shar-pei specific cnvs and in doing so allowed for the evaluation of a genetic test. this test could now be used in carefully managed breeding programs to methodically reduce the number of individuals carrying the disease associate allele  without dramatically reducing the breed’s overall genetic variation.
