BACKGROUND
piwi-interacting rnas  are a recently discovered class of small non-coding rnas that are related to, but distinct from, the better-known micrornas. pirnas are distinguished from micrornas by being slightly longer  vs. ~22 nt), mainly expressed in the germline and binding to piwi-class as opposed to ago-class argonaute proteins . although pirnas are abundantly expressed in both mammalian testis and ovary  <cit> , mouse pirna pathway mutant males are sterile but the mutant females have apparently normal oogenesis  <cit> . pirnas are thought to be processed from long polycistronic rnas transcribed from a limited number of specific loci in the genome called pirna clusters. the genomic locations of these loci are often conserved between related species such as mouse and human  <cit> , but the sequences of the pirnas themselves have evolved very rapidly, differ even between closely related species such as human and chimpanzee  <cit> .

the best understood role of pirnas, which is based primarily on work in drosophila and mouse, is to act as an adaptive immune system for repressing mobile elements  in the germline through a combination of post-transcriptional cleavage and dna methylation . this defense mechanism is thought to have deep evolutionary roots as both the pirna machinery and me-derived pirnas have been identified in a wide range of metazoans, including basal lineages  <cit> . during this process, pirnas are thought to alternatively cleave sense and antisense me transcripts in a positive feedback loop called the “ping-pong cycle”  <cit> . in mouse, different populations of pirnas are expressed at different stages of sperm development. pirnas produced during the pre-pachytene stage of spermatogenesis often map to mes and a fraction of pre-pachytene pirnas participate in the ping-pong cycle  <cit> . on the other hand, pirnas produced during and after the pachytene stage are strongly depleted in me sequences and are likely to have biological functions largely independent of me silencing.

recently, several lines of evidence suggest that pirnas also play an important role in regulating endogenous gene expression . first, in human, mouse and rat, a large fraction of pirnas do not derive from me regions  <cit>  but are nonetheless under selective constraint in humans, implying that they are functionally important  <cit> . second, a significant number of pirnas are processed from mrna transcripts in mouse, xenopus and drosophila, especially from 3’ untranslated regions  . the expression level of genic pirnas does not significantly correlate with the expression level of the host mrna, and mrnas producing pirnas are enriched for gene ontology terms different from those of genes highly expressed in the same germ cells  <cit> . this suggests that there exists an active mechanism to produce pirnas from a select subset of 3’utrs as opposed to a merely random processing of abundant mrnas in the cell. third, 3’utr-derived pirnas from the gene traffic jam in drosophila play a role in regulating fasciclin iii and oogenesis  <cit> . since most genic pirnas are not me-derived, these data collectively suggest that pirnas play a role in cellular gene regulation in the germline. nonetheless, the regulatory significance of most genic pirnas remains unknown and their biogenesis mechanism is unclear.

despite the emerging biological significance of pirnas, most pirna studies thus far have been conducted in model organisms and little is known about the abundance, diversity, origin, and function of human pirnas. here we performed high-throughput pirna sequencing in three human adult testis samples. using this dataset we analyzed the distribution of pirnas and pirna clusters across the human genome. we also examined their relationship with protein-coding genes, long non-coding rna genes, and mobile genetic elements.

RESULTS
sequencing pirnas from three human individuals
we sequenced the pirna-enriched small rna population of three human adult testis samples. the pirna enrichment was performed using a periodate oxidation and β-elimination  protocol that is often used in pirna studies  <cit> . our preliminary analysis also showed that the po treatment is very effective in eliminating the non-pirna component of the small rna population .

in total, we obtained ~ <dig> million reads from the three samples. after removing reads that match known small rnas  , reads that cannot map to the reference genome , and reads that are outside of the pirna size range , ~ <dig> million reads were considered to be putative pirna reads . consistent with the signature of pirnas observed in previous studies  <cit> , 75 ~ 80% of the putative pirna reads in each individual mapped uniquely to the genome. the size distribution of the mapped reads showed a peak in the range of 26– <dig> nucleotides for all samples and 60 ~ 78% of the reads in that size range started with a uridine  in each individual. these observations suggest that our sequencing libraries are strongly enriched for pirna sequences. therefore we used the ~ <dig> million putative pirna reads  for subsequent analyses. the final dataset contained ~ <dig>  million unique sequences. for simplicity, in the following section we will refer to the putative pirna reads as pirnas, and unique putative pirna sequences as unique pirnas.table  <dig>

pirna clusters are conserved across individuals
it is thought that mature pirnas originate from processing of longer rna precursors  <cit> . to infer putative pirna precursors, we mapped pirnas to the human reference genome and identified pirna clusters  using a method similar to previous studies  <cit> . specifically, we slid a 5 kb window by 1 kb steps along each chromosome and counted the number of pirnas in each window using the rpkm  metric .

using a relaxed rpkm cutoff of one, we identified  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  clusters from individual s <dig>  s <dig>  and s <dig>  respectively . the sizes of the clusters ranged from 1 kb to 276 kb and over 80% of the putative pirnas fell within one of the clusters. pirnas within the new clusters have similar characteristics among individuals and with the  <dig> pirna clusters identified in a previous study of human testis pirnas  <cit> . specifically, ~87% of the clusters had at least 75% of pirnas starting with a u  and about three quarters of the clusters had >75% of the pirnas on the same strand. assuming clusters overlap significantly with precursors, this suggests that most pirna precursors are transcribed and processed unidirectionally . interestingly, although most identified clusters are novel to this study, the overall chromosomal distribution of pirna clusters was very similar to the  <dig> pirna clusters defined by  <cit>  . this high degree of consistency strongly suggests that our experimental and computational methods are robust and the novel clusters we identified are bona fide pirna clusters.

although the expression level of the clusters among samples varied, the pirna clusters we identified were largely consistent among individuals. therefore, we pooled the data from all three individuals for cluster identification. using the pooled data we identified  <dig>  clusters  and ~90% of these clusters were found in any one of the three individuals. this result suggests that pirna clusters are largely conserved across human individuals and the observed variation between individuals could be attributed to differences in sequencing depth. the identified pirna clusters includes more than 98% of the  <dig> known pirna clusters  <cit> , and our much higher sequencing depth allowed us to identify many more clusters expressed at lower levels. figure  <dig> shows two pirna cluster examples.figure  <dig>

to determine the effect of the rpkm cutoff on the cluster identification, we applied multiple cutoffs. as expected, fewer pirna clusters were identified with more stringent cutoffs . at a rpkm cutoff of  <dig> , we found  <dig> clusters, which is very close to the  <dig> clusters identified in the study  <cit> . one hundred and fourteen of the  <dig> clusters  were present in our data set . because the cutoffs used in the literature are arbitrary and were defined when the sequencing depth was much lower than it is now, we decided to provide a list of all pirna cluster candidates that passed the relaxed cluster definition . the rpkm value for each pirna cluster candidate is available for researchers who wish to use a different cutoff .

the majority of human genic pirnas are derived from 3’utrs
previous studies suggested that mrna/3’utr-directed pirna generation could be a major mechanism for the primary pirna biogenesis in mouse and drosophila  <cit> . we examined the pirnas mapped to protein-coding genes to determine the potential role of protein-coding genes in pirna biogenesis in human. we found  <dig> , <dig> pirnas  mapped to the exonic regions of genes on the sense strand, while only  <dig>  pirnas  mapped to exonic regions on the reverse strand. the vast majority of these pirnas are unique:  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig>  unique pirnas  mapped to the exonic regions of genes on the sense and antisense strand, respectively. we define pirnas that map to exonic regions of protein-coding genes on the sense strand as “genic pirnas”. the genic pirnas show strong uridine enrichment at their first position . the vast majority of the genic pirnas  mapped uniquely to the genome and are depleted in me sequences: while ~ <dig> % of genic regions are me-derived, less than 2% of genic pirnas are me-derived. compared to genic pirnas in mouse, our data suggests humans have a higher proportion of genic pirnas: only ~2% of pirnas are genic in mouse adult testis  <cit> . this difference is consistent with previous results where 11% of human pirnas and 3% of mouse pirnas map to protein-coding genes, respectively  <cit> .

it is known that genic pirnas tend to be derived from 3’utrs in other animals  <cit> . to examine this pattern in human, we calculated the pirna enrichment in each of the three genic regions, 5’utr, cds, and 3’utr. for genes with at least  <dig> pirnas, we found a significant enrichment of pirnas in 3’utrs, as compared with cdss and 5’utrs . among all genes containing genic pirnas,  <dig>  have the highest number of pirnas in their 3’utrs  and we call these genes “3’utr pirna enriched genes”. the percentage of first uridine among pirnas within 3’utr pirna enriched genes is higher than all genic pirnas , and the percentage is even higher for pirnas within the 3’utrs of these genes . this result strongly suggests that the vast majority of these putative pirnas are processed by pirna biogenesis machinery. one example of the pirna mapping pattern in a 3’utr pirna enriched genes elfn <dig> is shown in figure 2b. one plausible model for explaining the presence of pirna-enriched genes is that the genic pirna biogenesis machinery processes mrnas from the transcriptome in proportion to their cellular abundance. to test this hypothesis, we determined the correlation between pirna abundance and gene expression level. we found a weak positive correlation between the number of 3’utr-derived pirnas and the gene expression level for all genes expressed in testis using previously published data  <cit>  . however, the most highly expressed genes in testis  <cit>  did not produce proportionally larger number of pirnas. the median number of 3’utr pirnas in the top 10% highly expressed genes is just  <dig> , whereas that in the  <dig> genes enriched for 3’utr pirnas is  <dig> . thus, it is more likely that an active molecular mechanism is responsible for genic pirna biogenesis from a subset of expressed genes in testes, and preferentially from their 3’utrs.figure  <dig>

next we performed gene ontology  term analysis for the  <dig> genes enriched for 3’utr pirnas compared to the  <dig> most highly expressed genes in testes that are not associated with pirnas. we found that the go terms over-represented in the 3’utr pirna enriched genes were very different from those in the highly expressed genes . genes enriched in pirnas in their 3’utr were more likely to be involved in chromatin modification  and regulation of cellular metabolic process , whereas highly expressed genes not associated with pirnas were involved in other biological processes such as mrna metabolic process  and spermatogenesis .

the number of 3’utr-derived pirnas showed significant correlation with 3’utr length . indeed, genes enriched in pirnas in their 3’utr tend to have much longer 3’utr length than all other genes . if pirnas are randomly produced from the 3’utr of any mrna, we would expect that the pirna producing genes will fall in the same category as the genes with the longest 3’utrs in the go term analysis. therefore, we performed go term analysis for the  <dig> genes that have the longest 3’utr and are not associated with pirnas . genes with the longest 3’utrs shared enrichment with pirna producing genes in some categories, such as metabolic process  and protein modification process . however, other categories, including chromatin modification  and chromatin organization  were specific to pirna producing genes. therefore, our results suggest that although pirna biogenesis pathways tend to produce pirnas from genes that have long 3’utrs, the genes are not randomly selected and are enriched for specific cellular functions.

pirna-producing genes are conserved across species
to determine if the 3’utr pirna enriched genes are conserved across species, we identified the human orthologs of the 3’utr pirna enriched genes in mouse and drosophila from  <cit> . we found that the human orthologous genes of mouse 3’utr pirna enriched genes have significantly more 3’utr-derived pirnas than all other genes . even when controlling for 3’utr length, normalized pirna enrichment in 3’utr, and gene expression level, 3’utr pirna producing genes are still highly conserved between the two species . furthermore, human genes orthologous to drosophila 3’utr-enriched genes also have significantly more 3’utr pirnas than all other genes .

performing the analysis on the gene-by-gene basis, 3’utr enriched genes in human significantly overlap with genes homologous to 3’utr enriched genes in mouse but not with drosophila . using pirna precursors identified in mouse testes  <cit> , we found a similarly significant level of overlap . taken together, these data indicate that pirna-producing genes are conserved between human and mouse but not between these mammals and drosophila.

some long non-coding rnas may act as primary pirna transcripts
long non-coding rnas  are a diverse class of rnas > <dig> nucleotide long with no apparent coding capacity but often expressed in a cell-type and developmental stage-specific pattern  <cit> . despite the existence of a few well-studied lncrnas such as xist, the biological function of most lncrnas is still unknown. we hypothesize that some annotated lncrna genes might be pirna precursors.

to test this hypothesis, we examined pirna expression levels in  <dig>  previously annotated lncrna genes. to increase the specificity of the analysis, we only included pirnas that mapped to the sense strand of lncrna exons. under this stringent condition,  <dig> to  <dig> lncrna loci showed appreciable amount of pirna expression, depending on the cutoff we used . two examples of the pirna mapping patterns in lncrnas are shown in figure  <dig>  for  <dig> lncrna loci, their exonic regions showed pirna expression level > = <dig> rpkm and pirnas mapped to >50% of the exonic regions. this enrichment is highly significant: the exonic regions of the  <dig> lncrna genes cover only  <dig> % of the whole genome but derive  <dig> % of the total putative pirnas,  <dig> times more than expected by chance . the pirna expression is also highly enriched in exons among the  <dig> lncrnas: for the  <dig> lncrnas that contain both exonic and non-exonic regions, the pirna expression in exonic regions is significantly higher than that in their non-exonic regions . overall, these results suggest that some annotated lncrna genes might serve as precursor transcripts of pirnas, and up to 16% of pirnas can be produced from these loci.table  <dig>

recently it became apparent that lncrnas are enriched for particular classes of mes embedded in their exons  <cit> . given the strong overlap we observed between pirnas and mature lncrnas, we examined the me content of the  <dig> lncrnas in table s <dig> . as a whole, the me content of pi-lncrnas  does not depart from that of other lncrnas  . as in the rest of the human genome, the me content of lncrnas is numerically dominated by non-ltr elements  . even though this bias is still visible for pi-lncrnas, ltr/erv elements are more abundant . moreover, the most statistically enriched me families in pi-lncrnas are predominantly of the ltr/erv class , as previously documented for all lncrnas  <cit> .

pirnas mapped to mobile elements
the best understood function of pirnas is regulating mes in several species  <cit> . to assess the potential role of pirna in me control in human, we examined the pirnas that mapped to known mes in human. overall 22% of pirnas mapped to mes in the reference genome. this fraction was similar to previous studies of mouse  pirnas but less than drosophila pirnas   <cit> , even though mes occupy more dna in the human genome  than in drosophila .

among different me classes, only ltr were significantly enriched for pirnas relative to their abundance in the genome . the ltr subfamily showed the highest pirna association is the ltr1/huers-p <dig> elements: 20% of the pirnas mapped to the antisense direction of ltrs mapped to these elements . huers-p <dig> is a low-copy number  primate-specific family of erv element who potentially encodes gag-like sequences  <cit> , and only account for  <dig> % of human genomic ltr elements.figure  <dig>

to determine the relationship between the age of me subfamilies and pirna mapping density, we compared the age rank of  <dig> me subfamilies  <cit>  with their pirna mapping densities. dna element subfamilies showed no significant correlation between their ages and pirna densities . line  and sine  elements showed significant negative correlation between the age of the subfamily and pirna density . in contrast, the ages of ltr subfamilies showed significant positive correlation with pirna densities , implying that younger elements are associated with higher pirna expression level, and they are more likely to be targeted by pirnas .

pirna mapping pattern in me consensus sequences
to determine if pirnas participate in me regulation via the ping-pong cycle mechanism in human, we mapped pirnas to the consensus sequences of major human me subfamilies and analyzed the density, direction , and potential ping-pong signatures of these pirnas. if a ping-pong cycle mechanism is used for me regulation, we expect the pirnas to be processed from both sense and antisense strands of an me  <cit> . pirnas that originated from the me transcripts and targeting the me transcripts should also show specific pairing patterns. figure 5a illustrates the two expected patterns for pirna pairs participating in the ping-pong cycle. according to the sequence signature at the first and the tenth bases of a pirna, we divided the pirnas matching the ping-pong cycle signature into sense ping-pong signature  or anti-sense ping-pong signature  . a pirna is considered to have the sps if it has an u at the first position  and matches the sense strand of the me consensus sequence, or it has an “a” at the 10th position  and matches the antisense strand of the me consensus. on the other hand, a pirna is considered to have the asps if it has 1u and matches the antisense strand or has 10a and matches the sense strand.we first investigated the pirnas that mapped to ltr <dig>  and sva elements . most pirnas mapped to the antisense strand of the ltr <dig> element between 400–500 bp of the consensus sequence. six putative ping-pong signature peaks that contain more than  <dig>  pirnas could be detected on the antisense strand in this region, including three sps and three asps peaks . one region displays both sps and asps signature . together these data suggest that ltr1/huers-p <dig> family of ltr element might be subject to an active pirna ping-pong cycle in human testis.for sva elements, the mapping patterns were largely congruent among the six subfamilies . sva elements are composed of three main sections, including a sine-r section that is derived from herv-k . the sine-r section in sva overlaps partial internal region  and partial 3’ ltr region  of the herv-k element. pirnas primarily mapped to the sine-r region of sva around position 1000 bp on both strands and both sps and asps peaks were observed . to determine if this enrichment was due to the mapping of herv-k derived pirnas, we compared the sva consensus sequence at the pirna enriched region  with the herv-k consensus sequence. within this region, the sva and herv-k consensus sequence differ by two nucleotide positions . therefore, it is unlikely that the herv-k derived pirnas will map to the sva consensus and the pirnas mapping to this region appear to be sva-specific.figure  <dig>

for alu elements, we constructed three composite consensus sequences , corresponding to the three major alu lineages  <cit> . pirnas showed distinct mapping patterns to the alu consensus sequences. several regions, including the rna polymerase iii internal promoter region at the 5’ end and middle a-linker region, showed a higher density of pirna mapping . one sps and one asps peak  could be observed in the middle a-linker region, both on the sense strand and the pirnas within the peak showed the highest similarity to aluy consensus . for l <dig>  we constructed six composite consensus sequences  corresponding to the major subfamilies defined by  <cit> . the 5’ end of the l <dig> consensus sequences, especially the 5’utr region , showed higher mapping density . unlike other me families, no strong ping-pong signature peak can be identified on the l <dig> consensus, despite the fact that pirna peaks are present on both strands of the consensus.

origin of pirnas on the antisense strand of mes
the most abundant pirna peaks we observed within mes were on the antisense direction of ltr <dig> and sva consensus sequences. next we determined if these pirnas were transcribed from distinct pirna clusters in the genome. to do so, we identified the perfect mapping positions of the most abundant pirna sequences within the peak regions . within ltr <dig>  using pirnas that mapped uniquely to one genomic location, we identified two pirna clusters defined in our study: chr14: <dig> ,001- <dig> , <dig> and chr21: <dig> ,525- <dig> , <dig>  about 98% of pirnas that were mapped antisense to ltr <dig> can be mapped perfectly to these two clusters. the ltr1s in each of the two clusters exist as parts of a full-length huers-p <dig> element. the pirna sequences were predicted to originate from three different ltrs  from these two elements . similarly, we identified one pirna cluster  which produced most pirnas mapping antisense to the sva consensus . the putative sva antisense cluster contains an sva element belonging to the sva-c subfamily. all three clusters were also presented in the pirna clusters defined by  <cit> .

discussion
in this study, we used an established periodate treatment and β-elimination protocol followed by illumina high-throughput sequencing technology to analyze the pirna population produced in three human adult testis samples. the putative pirnas in our dataset showed characteristics of canonical pirnas: they have a strong 1u bias, most of them fall in genomic clusters with strong directionality, and their overall genomic distribution closely resembles that from a previous study  <cit>  . all the evidence support that the vast majority of the sequences in our dataset are authentic pirnas. our data increases the total number of putative human pirnas by more than two orders of magnitude. this larger data set allowed us to reveal several interesting new insights into pirna function and evolution in the human lineage.

our first contribution is a significantly improved annotation of pirnas and pirna clusters in the human genome. our deeper sequencing over previous studies of human pirnas  allowed us not only to recover the previously known ~ <dig> pirna clusters but also to identify up to  <dig>  additional pirna cluster candidates with generally lower but consistent expression signals in the three individual testis samples. furthermore, this large data set provides us with increased statistical power to study in more detail the relationship of pirnas with protein-coding genes, lncrnas and mobile genetic elements. we realize that some of the pirna cluster candidates with lower expression level could be false positives. therefore, we provided the full list of the pirna cluster candidates along with their expression level. researchers who wish to increase the accuracy could apply more stringent expression level cutoff to the dataset.

to gain a better understanding of the primary pirna biogenesis mechanism and the role of pirnas in cellular gene regulation, we examined the pirnas derived from protein-coding genes. one potential role for genic pirnas is to reduce the expression level of the corresponding gene  <cit> , while another potential regulatory role is to repress other genes in trans by pairing to mrna with complementary sequence to the pirna in a fashion similar to micrornas  <cit> . genic pirnas could also direct chromatin modifications on the locus from which they are transcribed  <cit> . we found that exonic pirnas are preferentially derived from the 3’utrs of genes, especially genes with long 3’utrs, similar to the findings in mouse and drosophila  <cit> . it is not yet clear what accounts for the preference for 3’utr pirnas. possibly the biogenesis machinery competes with the rna translation machinery or the base composition of 3’utrs makes these pirnas more stable. alternatively, the pirna machinery could be guided to 3’utrs because of interaction with protein binding to 3’utrs and/or coupling to mrna splicing and mrna decay pathways. importantly, we found that genes enriched for 3’utr pirnas tend to be conserved between human and mouse, but not between these mammals and drosophila. in addition, we discovered an enrichment of genes within function categories such as chromatin modifiers among genes that have high pirna production level . because one of the mechanisms pirnas use to repress their targets is through dna methylation, which is associated with chromatin remodeling and modification  <cit> , this functional enrichment is reminiscent of the dual roles of the traffic jam gene in the drosophila pirna pathway  <cit> : traffic jam protein activates piwi expression and the traffic jam transcript is processed into pirnas. it would be interesting to see if other mrnas that are processed into pirnas also code for proteins that play a role in the pirna pathway. taken together, these data suggest the potential biological importance of pirnas in gene regulation.

third, we examined the overlap of pirnas and annotated lncrnas. for a small set of lncrnas , we observed significant overlap between putative pirnas and the exons of lncrnas on the same strand . this small number of lncrnas nonetheless accounted for up to 16% of all putative pirnas . this result suggests that a small subset of currently annotated lncrna genes might act as precursors for pirnas. this does not preclude other functions for these lncrnas since dual-function non-coding rnas are known to exist: for example, trnas could also give rise to pirnas. consistent with the idea that some lncrnas may enter the pirna biogenesis pathway, it has been reported that a large fraction  of human lncrnas are testis-specific  <cit> . in addition, we also observed an enrichment of ltr/erv class of mes in lncrnas enriched for pirnas. given the over-representation of ltr-associated pirnas in our dataset, ltr-derived lncrnas might be a prominent source of pirnas in human testes.

lastly, we were able to detect novel patterns in how pirnas map to and presumably target mobile elements. when mapped to the consensus sequences of mes, pirnas show distinct mapping patterns, with some pirna mapping peaks showing a signature of the ping-pong amplification cycle . this result suggests the pirnas are not just randomly generated but are rather derived from or target specific regions of the mes. however, most peaks in alu and l <dig> consensus sequences have relatively low density , despite that alu and l <dig> have the highest known retrotransposition activity in humans. the low pirna mapping density and the rarity of ping-pong signatures in alu and l <dig> mes suggest that the ping-pong mechanism is not the primary mechanism for regulating me activity in adult human testis, consistent with previous observations in mouse  <cit> . nevertheless, the current data does not allow us to preclude a more important role for fetal testis or ovarian pirnas in controlling these elements in the human germline.

in contrast, several observations suggest that adult testis pirnas might be involved in regulating ltr/erv activity in human. first, pirna density within an ltr family is strongly correlated with the age of the family: younger ltr families have higher pirna densities . we observe the opposite trend for sines and lines: older families have higher pirna density. second, ltr-associated pirnas have the highest expression level among me-associated pirnas, and pirna density in ltr elements is significantly higher than expected by chance . in contrast, sine and line families show lower than expected pirna densities in the genome. third, within ltr <dig> element, the me family producing the highest number of pirnas in our dataset, pirnas are primarily derived from the antisense direction and enriched in several peak regions, suggesting the antisense pirnas might recognize the ltr transcripts. it is known that ltr elements harbor promoter regions and could initiate transcription at their insertion sites, both for their own genes, as well as for adjacent cellular genes  <cit> . pirnas might be involved in targeting ltr transcripts and preventing adjacent host gene transcription.

ltr <dig> element was identified as the ltr of huers-p <dig> element by harada et al. in  <dig>  <cit> , but little research has been done on this element since then. we tried to determine the structure of the ltr <dig> element by sequence features, but only tata box at nucleotide position  <dig>  and polyadenylation signal at position  <dig>  could be predicted in the ltr <dig> consensus sequence. using tss-seq dataset from human adult testis  <cit> , we found the majority of tsss mapped between nucleotide position  <dig> and  <dig> . therefore, the u3-r boundary might locate within this region. ltr <dig> mapped pirnas are enriched between position  <dig> and  <dig>  and do not overlap the tsss, suggesting that they have a potential role of targeting ltr <dig> transcripts rather than disrupting transcription factor binding.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, our study provides the most comprehensive analysis of pirnas from adult human testis to date. we note that although a few other small-scale studies on human total small rnas have been recently reported  <cit> , they did not go in depth into pirna analysis. our analysis defines a catalog of human pirna cluster candidates and sheds new light into the relationship between pirnas and protein-coding genes, lncrna genes, as well as mobile elements. these findings establish a foundation for future analyses of the function and evolution of pirnas in human.
