BACKGROUND
correct folding and disulfide bond formation is essential for the function of many secreted proteins including bacterial toxins, and their formation is facilitated by disulfide bond forming  oxidoreductase proteins, which usually contain a conserved thioredoxin  fold  <cit> . protein disulfide bonds can serve structural roles, and thus are often buried in the core of a protein. however, in the case of dsb proteins, partially exposed disulfide bonds in the trx-fold cxxc motif have catalytic roles in protein folding, electron transport and bioenergetics in a variety of organisms  <cit> .

the dsb proteins of escherichia coli are the best characterized, and reside in its periplasm to correctly fold disulfide bond containing secreted and cell-wall proteins  <cit> . e. coli dsba  catalyzes the oxidation of disulfide bonds in reduced, unfolded proteins  <cit> , and is then re-oxidized by ubiquinone via e. coli dsbb , an inner membrane transmembrane protein, which in turn is oxidized by the electron transport pathway  <cit> . e. coli dsbc  and e. coli dsbg  serve as proofreading disulfide isomerases that are able to break and correctly reform non-native protein disulfide bonds, thus ensuring that these important secreted proteins are functionally active  <cit> . e. coli dsbd  is responsible for maintaining ec-dsbc and ec-dsbg in their active redox states and is a transmembrane protein also spanning the inner membrane  <cit> . finally, e. coli dsbe  is a reductant involved in cytochrome c maturation  <cit> , its redox partner is also proposed to be ec-dsbd  <cit> . dsb-like homologs have been found in many prokaryotes  <cit> , including gram-positive bacteria where they also appear to be widespread. as gram-positive bacteria have no spatially defined periplasmic compartment, the precise function and membrane bound redox partners of these dsb-like proteins appear to differ from those of gram-negative bacteria  <cit> .

dsb proteins, and in particularly dsba, have been shown to be involved in virulence of toxin-secreting gram-negative bacteria such as yersinia pestis  <cit> , shigella sp.  <cit> , vibrio cholerae  <cit>  and e. coli  <cit> . mycobacterium tuberculosis  is a pathogenic bacterium responsible for tuberculosis , which causes approximately  <dig>  million deaths and  <dig> million new cases per year  <cit> . mtb secreted proteins have many different functions including those associated with virulence, pathogenicity and cell-wall maintenance. within the mtb proteome, it has been predicted that over  <dig> proteins are secreted, of which ~ 60% may contain disulfide bonds based on their cysteine content, thus suggesting that dsb proteins may play an important role in the correct folding of secreted proteins  <cit> . mtb espa is one such secreted protein that may require the folding assistance of mtb dsb proteins. the single disulfide bond within mtb espa has been found to have an important role in disease progression in mice as well as maintaining cell wall integrity  <cit> , highlighting a crucial link between disulfide bond formation and virulence in mtb. one could speculate that interruption of the mtb dsb-assisted folding pathways may prevent mycobacterial infectivity and viability. therefore, the study of mtb dsb protein systems may offer new insight into its virulence and may provide novel anti-tb drug targets.

in mtb, there are thought to be two distinct dsb systems, shown in figure  <dig>  the first system is proposed to have two periplasmic proteins, mtb dsbe  and dsbf , and their inner membrane redox partner is thought to be mtb dsbd   <cit>  or rv2877c  <cit> . unlike the reductant ec-dsbe  <cit> , both mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf are oxidants as confirmed by their ability to oxidatively fold hirudin  <cit> . the second proposed oxidoreductase system is the mtb rv2969c/rv2968c system  <cit> ; rv2968c is annotated as a vitamin k epoxide reductase  and rv2969c as a hypothetical protein  <cit> . as rv2969c has high sequence identity to gram-positive bacterial dsba homologs, bacillus subtilis bdbd  and staphylococcus aureus dsba   <cit> , we shall refer to rv2969c as mt-dsba hereafter. a recent report suggests that mt-dsba both localizes on the mycobacterial surface and is associated with the membrane  <cit> , and thus is probably membrane-tethered. since rv2968c and rv2969c are within the same operon and because mt-vkor can functionally substitute ec-dsbb in vivo <cit> , mt-vkor and mt-dsba may function together  <cit> . interestingly, an exhaustive transposon mutagenesis study showed that the genes encoding mt-vkor and mt-dsba are essential for optimal mtb growth, whereas mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf are not  <cit> , implying that mt-dsba is an essential mtb protein.

in this study, we have determined the  <dig>  Å-resolution structure of the soluble form of mt-dsba . the overall fold of mt-dsba is reminiscent of ec-dsba  <cit>  and consists of two domains, a trx domain and an inserted α-helical domain. the mt-dsba trx domain active site cxxc motif cysteines are reduced while a stabilizing disulfide bond is observed in the α-helical domain  <cit> . unlike mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf, mt-dsba does not have the ability to catalyze the oxidative folding of hirudin  <cit> . however mt-dsba possesses disulfide bond isomerase activity as confirmed by its ability to catalyze the refolding of scrambled ribonuclease a  whereas mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf do not. this study represents the structural and functional characterization of an essential mtb dsb protein, mt-dsba, and suggests that mt-dsba likely acts on a distinct protein substrate set as compared to mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf due to their functional differences.

RESULTS
the structure of mt-dsba
mt-dsba is predicted to be either secreted into the periplasm by a signal peptide   <cit>  or tethered to the inner membrane by an n-terminal transmembrane helix   <cit> . a recent paper suggested that mt-dsba is a membrane-tethered protein  <cit> , prompting the investigation of the soluble form of mt-dsba encoding residues 46– <dig>  as suggested by tmhmm.

the crystal structure of the soluble form of mt-dsba was solved by molecular replacement utilizing the model of bs-bdbd , which shares 20% sequence identity with mt-dsba, combined with the location of two selenium atoms determined from the anomalous data. the structure of mt-dsba was solved to  <dig>  Å resolution, with two molecules in the asymmetric unit, and the final model had an rwork/rfree  of  <dig> / <dig> . within the asymmetric unit, residues 56– <dig> from monomer a and residues 49– <dig> from monomer b were built into the electron density map while the remaining n-terminal residues were presumed to be disordered as there was no observable density. monomers a and b are structurally similar and superimpose with a root-mean-square deviation  of  <dig>  Å. each mt-dsba monomer comprises two domains , a trx domain  and an inserted α-helical domain , reminiscent of the overall fold of ec-dsba  <cit> . the trx domain contains the canonical cxxc motif and consists of a four-stranded mixed β-sheet  decorated with four α-helices . the α-helical domain inserted between β <dig> and α <dig> of the trx domain comprises four α-helices , and is stabilized by a structural disulfide bond between helices α <dig> and α <dig> , despite  <dig> mm dtt in the crystallization condition. the long helix α <dig> transitions from the α-helical domain back to the trx domain. the cxxc active site cysteines, adopt a right-handed hook conformation at the n-terminal of helix α <dig> where the solvent exposed cys <dig> and solvent buried cys <dig> are reduced with a distance of  <dig>  Å between the two sγ atoms . the mt-dsba cis-pro loop , a conserved feature within the redox-active trx family, interacts with the cxxc motif through thr <dig>  which hydrogen bonds to both cys <dig> and cys <dig> . the sγ atom of cys <dig> is stabilized by weak hydrogen bonds to the amide n atom of asp <dig> , the thr <dig> hydroxyl oγ atom  while the sy atom of cys <dig> is hydrogen bonded to the thr <dig> hydroxyl oγ atom  and its backbone carbonyl o atom . additionally, cys <dig> is hydrogen bonded to two water molecules , and one of these waters  in turn forms a hydrogen bond with thr <dig> hydroxyl oγ atom and its backbone carbonyl o atom.

mt-dsba has structural similarity to other bacterial dsba proteins
a structural homology search using the dali server  <cit>  showed that mt-dsba has high structural homology with bacterial dsba-like proteins . the two closest structural homologs to mt-dsba  are gram-positive bacteria, bs-bdbd   <cit>  and sa-dsba   <cit>  with rmsd values of  <dig>  Å over  <dig> cα atoms and  <dig>  Å over  <dig> cα atoms, respectively. of note, bs-bdbd contains a novel metal binding site at an interdomain position  <cit> , which is not observed in other dsba homologs . the next closest structural homolog is a dsba-like protein from gram-negative bacteria wolbachia pipientis   <cit> , which also contains a structural disulfide bond in its inserted α-helical domain as observed for mt-dsba  <cit> . ec-dsba also has structural homology with mt-dsba with an rmsd of  <dig>  Å over  <dig> cα atoms   <cit> . there are two main distinct structural features of mt-dsba compared to the above dsba homologs. first mt-dsba has an extra c-terminal helix , figures 2a &3g. second, within the inserted α-helical domain there are two extended loop regions connecting β <dig> to α <dig>  and α <dig> to α <dig>  both within the vicinity of the cxxc active site . further, the outer β-strands of the central β-sheet of the trx domain varies between ec-dsba and mt-dsba , where mt-dsba has an extra strand  at the n-terminal of its β-sheet compared to ec-dsba, while ec-dsba has two extra β-strands at the c-terminal of its β-sheet compared to mt-dsba. additionally, ec-dsba has an extended loop region between its c-terminal β-strand and α-helix, which contributes to the formation of the deep cxxc hydrophobic binding pocket  required for its interaction with ec-dsbb  <cit>  but not present in mt-dsba or the other dsba homologs .

mt-dsba cannot oxidatively fold reduced and denatured hirudin
since mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf have the ability to oxidatively fold reduced and denatured hirudo medicinalis hirudin  <cit> , we tested if mt-dsba is able to function similarly. the thrombin inhibitor, hirudin, is a  <dig>  kda protein that contains three intramolecular disulfide bonds. maldi-tof mass spectrometry analysis of commercial native hirudin revealed significant impurities as well as a major hirudin peak  followed by several smaller hirudin peaks ranging up to m/z  <dig>  consistent with previous reports that hirudin is a non-homogenous protein that contains several variants  <cit> . reverse-phase hplc was used to enhance the homogeneity of the m/z  <dig> peak as well as remove most contaminating proteins. maldi-tof mass spectrometry of hplc-purified reduced, unfolded hirudin showed a uniform m/z increase of  <dig> da. furthermore, the addition of iodoacetamide to reduced, unfolded hirudin carbamidomethylated the free cysteines and resulted in a mass increase of six 57-da increments . thus, the major maldi-tof peak was used to monitor the regeneration of reduced, unfolded hirudin  to the fully oxidized native state in the absence and presence of greater than three molar equivalents of mt-dsba, mt-dsbf or ec-dsba. at various time points, samples from the folding assay were quenched by the addition of iodoacetamide and analyzed by maldi-tof mass spectrometry. the appearance of native hirudin  is represented as a percentage of the total intensities of native and carbamidomethylated hirudin. in the absence of dsb protein, a small fraction of native hirudin was observed after  <dig> hours , presumably due to spontaneous, air-mediated oxidation  <cit> . as previously reported, mt-dsbf is able to reoxidize hirudin, and after  <dig> hours of incubation with mt-dsbf, approximately 70% of hirudin was in its native state compared to 100% when incubated with ec-dsba  <cit> . in contrast, after an 8-hour incubation with mt-dsba, a small fraction of native hirudin equivalent to that of the spontaneous oxidative folding of hirudin in the absence of dsb protein was observed .

mt-dsba does not have the ability to reduce insulin
insulin contains two polypeptide chains  and has one intramolecular and two intermolecular disulfide bonds. reduction of these disulfide bonds results in the dissociation of chains a and b, where chain b is insoluble and aggregates. thus, the reduction of insulin may be assessed by following the increase in turbidity at  <dig> nm, which is due to the aggregation of chain b and can be determined in the presence and absence of a disulfide reductase. we determined the rate of insulin reduction in the presence of either mt-dsba, mt-dsbe, mt-dsbf or positive controls . ec-dsbc and ec-dsba both possess insulin reductase activity; however ec-dsbc is a stronger reductase than ec-dsba . in contrast, in the presence of mt-dsba, mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf insulin exhibited basal-levels of aggregation similar to that of insulin in the absence of dsb protein, suggesting that these dsb proteins are unable to reduce insulin under the conditions tested .

mt-dsba is able to refold scrambled rnasea
mt-dsba contains some residues characteristic of the e. coli disulfide bond isomerases ec-dsbc and ec-dsbg . to determine whether mt-dsba has isomerase activity, we tested mt-dsba catalyzed recovery of active rnasea from oxidized, disulfide-scrambled rnasea . this assay revealed that mt-dsba possesses scrnasea isomerase activity and the active site cxxc cysteines are required for activity, as cys89ser and cys92ser mutations render mt-dsba inactive . however, the structural disulfide bond in the inserted α-helical domain does not play a role in this activity as the cys140ser and cys192ser mutants retain similar isomerase activity to wild-type mt-dsba . of note, wp-dsba also contains a structural disulfide bond in its α-helical domain , and mutation of these cysteines to alanines does not affect its disulfide bond isomerase activity  <cit> , as observed for mt-dsba. moreover, neither mtb-dsbe nor mt-dsbf can catalyze the refolding of scrnasea to produce active rnasea, and thus do not appear to have isomerase activity under the conditions tested . these results demonstrate that mt-dsba has protein disulfide isomerase activity, while mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf do not possess this activity on the substrates tested in this study.

discussion
comparisons of molecular surfaces and functions of dsba-like proteins to mt-dsba
the electrostatic molecular surface representation of mt-dsba  reveals a shallow hydrophobic pocket at the cxxc active site surrounded by negatively charged patches. the residues that contribute to the negatively charged patch above the cxxc motif are within the α-helical domain, asp <dig>  glu <dig> and asp <dig>  from the two extended loops as well as asp <dig> and glu <dig> from α <dig> helix, whereas residues that contribute to the negative patch below the cxxc motif are from the trx domain, glu <dig> and glu <dig>  positioned in the loop region connecting β <dig> to α <dig>  for ec-dsba , the characteristic surface features include a deep hydrophobic groove formed by an extended loop region connecting the c-terminal β-strand and α-helix , which interacts with a periplasmic loop of its redox partner, ec-dsbb  <cit> . furthermore, an additional hydrophobic patch above the cxxc is thought to be important for binding unfolded protein substrates  <cit> . similar surface charge and architecture is seen in other gram-negative dsba proteins such as v. cholerae tcpg  <cit>  and neisseria meningitidis nmdsba <dig>  <cit> , as compared to ec-dsba. the gram-positive bacterial sa-dsba  also has a shallow hydrophobic pocket at the cxxc motif as well as a negative patch directly above its cxxc motif; however this negative patch is not as extensive as the one observed for mt-dsba . of note, wp-dsba has a basic electrostatic surface and deep binding groove near its cxxc motif .

the residues surrounding the cxxc active site motifs are similar among the dsba-like proteins, however there are subtle differences that may modulate substrate recognition and reactivity. within mt-dsba, sa-dsba and wp-dsba , the residue preceding cis-pro is a thr, whereas the corresponding ec-dsba residue is val . in mt-dsba, the hydrogen bond between the amide proton of asp <dig> and thiolate of cys <dig> is also observed in sa-dsba , whereas asp is substituted with a ser residue at this position in both ec-dsba and wp-dsba . the loop region above the active site contains two hydrophobic residues followed by asp <dig> in mt-dsba , also observed for wp-dsba , whereas for both ec-dsba and sa-dsba the charged asp residue is substituted with gly . finally, the third water molecule  observed within the active site vicinity of mt-dsba is hydrogen bonded to another water  and also to glu <dig>  which contributes to the negative molecular surface surrounding the cxxc motif . a positionally equivalent glutamate residue near the cxxc motif is also observed within the structure of sa-dsba  whereas in ec-dsba, glu <dig> is substituted by gln that is not surface-exposed  and the corresponding residue is tyr <dig> in wp-dsba, which is considerably further away from the active site as compared to glu <dig> of mt-dsba .

ec-dsba can catalyze the reduction of insulin in the presence of dtt  <cit> ; in contrast, mt-dsba does not show such activity, which may be a consequence of its less hydrophobic patch above the cxxc active site motif . previous studies of sa-dsba demonstrate that, like mt-dsba, it has no ability to catalyze the reduction of insulin  <cit> , and both mt-dsba and sa-dsba have a similar negatively charged molecular surface above the cxxc motif . however, when the preceding cis-pro sa-dsba residue, thr <dig> was mutated to val as observed in the ec-dsba cis-pro loop , some insulin reduction activity was restored while sa-dsba isomerase activity remained unchanged. in the wp-dsba study  <cit> , a similar thr to val mutation in the cis-pro motif  also demonstrated more insulin reductase activity together with reduced isomerase activity compared to wild-type wp-dsba, and the wp-dsba thr172val mutant has a similar activity profile as ec-dsba  <cit> . these observations suggest that the residue preceding cis-pro influences substrate recognition and, in part the activities of dsb proteins, leading to the speculation that lack of insulin reduction activity for mt-dsba may also result from disruption of substrate binding at the negatively charged patch .

structural and functional comparison of mt-dsba to mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf
three secreted or membrane-tethered mtb dsb proteins have been structurally and biochemically studied, mt-dsbe  <cit> , mt-dsbf  <cit>  and in this study, mt-dsba. while mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf are structurally similar with an rmsd of  <dig>  Å , mt-dsba is structurally distinct . firstly, mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf both consist of one trx-like domain comprising a five stranded anti-parallel β-sheet decorated by four α-helices  and an additional n-terminal region. in contrast, mt-dsba consists of two domains  and has an overall fold reminiscent of ec-dsba  <cit> . while the core trx fold for all three mtb dsb proteins is conserved, the trx domains of both mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf are more complex compared to that of mt-dsba. both mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf have an additional n-terminal region comprising a short 310-helix followed by a β-hairpin and another short 310-helix, and their central β-sheets contain an initial extra β-strand to produce five stranded antiparallel β-sheets compared to the four stranded mixed β-sheet observed for mt-dsba. finally, mt-dsba has an extra c-terminal α-helix , which is not present in the structures of mt-dsbe or mt-dsbf . additionally, the electrostatic molecular surface surrounding the catalytic cxxc motif of mt-dsba is more negatively charged than those observed for either mt-dsbe or mt-dsbf  <cit> .

besides structural differences, mt-dsba exhibits functional differences compared to mt-dsbf and mt-dsbe. both mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf can oxidatively fold reduced and denatured hirudin  <cit>  whereas mt-dsba does not possess this activity. in contrast, only mt-dsba exhibits isomerase/oxidizing activity on the substrate, scrnasea. these results suggest two features that differentiate mt-dsba from mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf. first, mt-dsba probably functions on a separate subset of mtb substrates compared to mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf. second, one could postulate that mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf have redundant activities even though they have negatively correlated gene expression profiles  <cit> , whereas mt-dsba is the sole protein to carry out its unique function in the mtb dsb system , and thus rv2969c is an essential gene  <cit> .

since rv2968c and rv2969c are within the same operon and because mt-vkor can functionally substitute ec-dsbb in vivo <cit>  and is part of the disulfide bond formation pathway  <cit> , we suggest that membrane-bound mt-vkor is responsible for maintaining the redox state of its genomic neighbor, mt-dsba. the structure of synechococcus sp. vkor in complex with its naturally fused thioredoxin-like protein has been solved  <cit> . we constructed a model of mt-vkor based on the synechococcus sp. structure  and modeled mt-dsba interacting with the mt-vkor loop region which contains two of the four cysteines required for full activity of mt-vkor  <cit> , figure 8a. interestingly, a previous study has shown that the activity of mt-vkor can be inhibited by warfarin, an anticoagulant  <cit> , while another study has shown that small molecules can bind another dsba-like protein, v. cholerae tcpg  <cit> . as mt-dsba and mt-vkor are both essential mtb proteins  <cit>  and are susceptible to small molecules binding, we propose that they may be good candidates for mtb drug discovery.

implications for mt-dsba in host-pathogen interactions
a previous study demonstrated that mt-dsba localized on the mtb membrane in vitro, and that it also contains several host-cell binding regions  <cit> . a twenty amino acid mt-dsba peptide was used to produce antibodies that demonstrated that mt-dsba is exposed on the mycobacterial cell surface. this peptide includes α-helix  within the inserted α-helical region  and contains many charged residues exposed on the molecular surface of mt-dsba. additionally, it was shown that two other twenty amino acid peptides of mt-dsba, one from the n-terminal region  and the other from the c-terminal region , figure 2a, have the ability to bind to epithelial cells and inhibit mtb invasion of these cells in a dose-dependent manner at high micromolar concentrations.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we show that mt-dsba is structurally distinct from mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf. additionally, unlike mt-dsbe and mt-dsbf, mt-dsba is unable to oxidatively fold reduced and denatured hirudin but can catalyze the refolding of scrnasea. taken together, these results imply that mt-dsba functions on a disparate set of substrates compared to either mt-dsbe or mt-dsbf. furthermore, the knowledge that mt-dsba possibly facilitates mycobacterial interaction with host cells  <cit>  implicates mt-dsba as a potential vaccine candidate. moreover, as both mt-dsba and mt-vkor are encoded by essential genes  <cit> , interruption of the mt-dsba and mt-vkor protein-protein interaction and its redox cycle, may greatly inhibit mycobacterial growth and virulence. thus further investigation into host protein/mt-dsba, small molecule/mt-dsba and mtb protein/mt-dsba interactions is warranted, as mt-dsba could be an excellent target for novel anti-tb therapeutics.
