BACKGROUND
small ruminant lentiviruses  are members of the retroviridae family and include caprine arthritis encephalitis virus  and maedi-visna virus , which infect goats and sheep worldwide  <cit> . srlvs cause chronic inflammatory lesions in various organ systems, with the main target organs being the central nervous system, lungs, joints and mammary gland. the clinical disease usually takes years to develop and infection is for life. the infection is mainly transmitted from ewe to lamb through the colostrum and by a respiratory route among animals in close contact  <cit> . the main target cells are monocytes-macrophages and dendritic cells, in which, following infection, srlvs integrate as a provirus in the cell genome of the host  <cit> .

the provirus genome of srlvs is typical of lentiviruses, composed of three genes coding for structural proteins: gag, pol and env, an additional three genes, which encode for non-structural proteins: tat, rev and vif and a non-coding long terminal repeat region  composed of u3-r-u <dig>  <cit> .

there is currently no treatment against srlvs and no successful vaccination is available  <cit> . disease control relies on high quality diagnostic tools to identify and eliminate infected animals and to prevent new infections. the agar gel immunodiffusion test  and, more recently, the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay  are the most commonly used means for detecting specific antibodies of a broad spectrum of viral strains and are used as screening assays  <cit> . to confirm or reject the results of the screening assays and to resolve indeterminate results, supplementary tests, such as western blotting  and peptide elisa are used  <cit> . polymerase chain reaction  is also used to complement the serological methods  <cit> . due to the slow sero-conversion of infected animals, or even no conversion at all, with the possibility of some animals with a low antibody titre becoming transiently seronegative  <cit> , a combination of serology and pcr might be optimal for detecting srlv infected animals  <cit> . since no free virus has been detected with rt-pcr in the plasma or serum of naturally infected animals, pcr is used mainly for detecting the integrated proviral genome in peripheral blood leucocytes. there have also been a few reports describing real time pcr for the detection of srlv  <cit> . the highly heterogeneous srlv genome and low proviral load hinder the usefulness of pcr for diagnosing infection with srlv, although the development of an assay based on viral strains circulating in a particular geographic area might solve the former problem  <cit> .

shah et al.  proposed a phylogenetic reclassification that divides srlv into four genotypes, a to d  <cit> . a new genotype e has recently been detected  <cit> . genotypes a and b, mvv and caev prototypes, respectively, are widely distributed throughout the world, whereas genotypes c, d and e are geographically restricted. genotype a is highly heterogeneous, since it contains at least fifteen subtypes, a <dig> to a <dig>  <cit> , while genotype b is less complex and contains three subtypes, b <dig> to b <dig>  <cit> . viral strains isolated from norwegian goats are classified into genotype c and genotype d refers to viral strains isolated in switzerland and spain  <cit> . genotype e has only been detected in italy and it contains two subtypes, e <dig> and e <dig>  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of srlvs also supports evidence of natural cross-species transmission  <cit> , which needs to be considered in disease control.

in order to improve molecular diagnostics of srlv infections, a two new real time pcr assays were developed, using taqman probes for the specific detection of genotype a and b srlv strains and differentiation between them. such a method has not to date been described.

RESULTS
real time pcr design
two new taqman probe based real time pcr assays for the specific detection of genotype a and b srlv strains and differentiation between them were developed: a caev assay for specific detection of genotype b srlv strains and an mvv assay for the specific detection of genotype a srlv strains. primers and probes  were designed in the gagma gene region to amplify  <dig> bp  and  <dig> bp  long fragments. both taqman probes were labeled with the fluorescent reporter dye fam and differentiation between mvv and caev was only possible using two separate reactions. the same annealing temperatures for both assays enabled simultaneous detection of genotype a and b srlv strains in the same run but using two separate reactions.

analytical and diagnostic specificity
all tested srlv strains  were successfully amplified. the reference virus strain caev co, virus subtype b <dig> strain and two slovenian b <dig> strains were successfully amplified using the caev assay. the mvv assay detected the reference virus strain mvv kv <dig>  virus subtype a <dig>  a <dig> strains and slovenian strains of four different subtypes belonging to genotype a . when the pcr products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel, they were of specific size  and  <dig> bp ). the nucleotide sequences of the pcr products amplified with the mvv assay and the caev assay were specific for genotype a and genotype b strains, respectively. when the genotype a strains  were tested with the caev assay and the genotype b strains  with the mvv assay for cross reactivity, no reactivity was observed with either of them. no amplification was also observed when samples from seronegative animals from seronegative flocks  were tested with both assays. blast search results showed significant sequence identity of the primer mvvma r <dig> only towards genotype a, while the mvvma f <dig> primer showed identity also to genotypes c and e and the mvvma probe also to genotype e. as shown in the additional file , several mismatches of both mvv primers and probe were observed for genotype c. probe mvvma showed 100% identity with genotype e and there was one mismatch between mvvma f <dig> and genotype e. five mismatches that were found between the mvvma r <dig> primer and genotype e make this primer unable to prime with genotype e. it was estimated that the mvv assay cross reacts with neither genotype c nor genotype e srlv strains.

the method is 100% specific, since all tested strains were detected and no amplification was observed when samples from seronegative animals from seronegative flocks were tested. the method enables the detection of genotype a and b srlv strains, as well as differentiation between them.

analytical and diagnostic sensitivity
the analytical sensitivity of the caev and mvv assays was evaluated using plasmid dna carrying caev co dna and mvv kv <dig> dna, respectively. when 10-fold serial dilutions with plasmid dna ranging from 1- <dig> copies/pcr were tested, both assays were able to detect at least  <dig> copies. the caev assay also detected  <dig> copies with an average ct value of  <dig> , whereas no amplification of  <dig> copies was observed with the mvv assay . the limit of detection  of both assays was estimated to be less than  <dig> copies and was determined after testing ten replicates of plasmid dna dilutions with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> copies/pcr using probit analysis, which revealed that the caev assay reliably detected  <dig> copies and the mvv assay  <dig> copies . the diagnostic sensitivity of both assays was tested using samples from elisa positive animals from  <dig> seropositive flocks. samples from  <dig> elisa positive animals were tested. the mvv assay detected  <dig> out of  <dig>  seropositive sheep from farm  <dig>  and from farms  <dig> and  <dig> . the caev assay detected  <dig> out of  <dig>  seropositive goats from farm  <dig>  infected with b <dig> srlv strains. both assays detected  <dig> out of  <dig>  seropositive goats from farm  <dig>  and  <dig> out of  <dig>  from farm  <dig> . altogether, the two assays detected  <dig> samples from elisa positive animals, exhibiting a sensitivity of 79%. the mvv assay also detected all of the  <dig> samples from elisa negative animals  that were ltr-pcr positive in a previous study. these pcr products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel and were of specific size . the nucleotide sequences of the pcr products were specific for subtypes a <dig> and a <dig>  no amplification was observed when samples from  <dig> elisa negative animals were tested with the two assays. the kappa statistic was  <dig>  , which indicates good agreement between elisa and the two real time pcr assays jointly.

real time pcr performance
serial dilutions of dna isolated from reference virus strains caev co and mvv kv <dig> were prepared to evaluate the performance of the new taqman probe based real time pcr assays. each dilution was amplified in three replicates and repeated in three separate reactions with the caev and mvv assays. intra-assay variability was first tested to determine the repeatability of the two assays. the intra-assay coefficient of variation  of the mvv assay for all serial dilutions ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, with the most variation observed in the highest dilutions. the caev assay exhibited slightly more intra-assay variation than the mvv assay, with the cv for all serial dilutions ranging from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. most variation was observed in the undiluted dna and in the highest dilutions . second, the inter-assay variation was tested to determine the reproducibility of the two assays. the inter-assay cv was from  <dig> % to  <dig> % and from  <dig> % to  <dig> % for the mvv and caev assays, respectively , with the caev assay again performing slightly worse. the efficiency, r <dig> and dynamic range were next determined from the standard curves. the reaction efficiencies of all three repeats of the mvv assay were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, with r <dig> being higher than  <dig>  . all three repeats of the caev assay showed reaction efficiencies of  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, with r <dig> being higher than  <dig>  . both assays had a wide dynamic range of reliable amplification linearity, of at least  <dig> orders of magnitude  .

control of inhibition
for the control of the potential inhibitory effect of the sample matrix, ten pools of leukocyte suspensions from seronegative animals were spiked with goat synovial membrane /lamb synovial membrane  cells infected with caev/mvv. the cv for the caev and mvv assays was calculated from the obtained ct values. since the cv was  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the caev and mvv assays, respectively, it can be concluded that practically no inhibitors are present in this type of sample matrix.

discussion
the use of real time pcr technology in routine microbial diagnostics has rapidly increased, due to its advantages of quick turnaround times, capacity for high throughput and high specificity  <cit> . several real time pcr assays for srlv detection have also been published  <cit> , but to our knowledge only four real time pcr assays for diagnostic purposes have been described to date  <cit> .

development of a single assay that universally detects srlv is complicated by the high level of genetic heterogeneity of srlv, which are grouped into five genotypes and several subtypes  <cit> . brinkhoff et al.  described two universal real time pcr assays for detection of mvv and caev, which amplified ltr and leader-gag genomic regions using sybr green intercalating dye. the assays were first tested with srlv strains from dutch field flocks and the leader-gag pcr performed better, with sensitivities of 88%  and 82% . when samples from seropositive animals originating from different geographical regions from norway, france, spain and italy were tested, decreased sensitivity was observed, with 85% of positive sheep and 63% of positive goats with the leader-gag pcr. however, the phylogenetic classification of the tested srlv strains was not reported. firm conclusions concerning the performance of the two assays with international samples were prevented by the small number of investigated samples.

due to the high heterogeneity of the rapidly evolving lentiviral genome, de andres et al.  suggest that diagnostic methods need to be adapted to viral strains circulating in a particular geographic area. herrmann-hoesing et al.  developed and validated an oppv quantitative pcr assay using taqman probes, which was designed to amplify a fragment of the tm region of the env gene of north american oppv strains and was tested on naturally infected sheep. brajon et al.  designed a real time pcr assay in the env genomic region specific for caev, using sybr green intercalating dye. this assay was tested on naturally infected elisa positive goats and also on experimentally infected goats. a taqman real time pcr assay specific for caev was developed in the gagca gene region by li et al. , detecting all agid positive sheep and goats.

the aim of this study was to develop a taqman probe based real time pcr for the specific detection of genotype a  and b  srlv strains in order to improve molecular diagnostics of srlv infections. since the phylogenetic analysis of slovenian srlv strains revealed that ovine strains belong to genotype a and caprine strains to genotypes a and b  <cit> , two assays were designed for the specific detection of genotype a  and genotype b  srlv strains, based mainly on nucleotide sequences from slovenian strains, as well as nucleotide sequences retrieved from genbank. since it is known that srlv can cross the inter-species barrier  <cit> , it was also designed to differentiate between mvv and caev. such a method has not to date been described. the primers and probes were designed in the gagma gene region. in order to enable detection of a broad range of srlv strains, degenerate bases were included in both reverse primers and the caevma probe. since both taqman probes were labeled with the fluorescent reporter dye fam, differentiation between genotype a and b srlv strains was only possible using two separate reactions. the method was optimized for the simultaneous detection  of genotype a and b srlv strains, using the same annealing temperatures for both assays.

it is essential that the assay is performed with high specificity. the analytical and diagnostic specificity of both assays was thus evaluated. both assays were able to detect all tested phylogenetically diverse srlv strains belonging to genotype a  and genotype b , whereas no amplification was observed when samples from animals from seronegative flocks were tested. when the genotype a strains were tested with the caev assay and the genotype b strains were tested with the mvv assay also no amplification was detected. it was established that the method is 100% specific and enables the detection of at least slovenian genotype a and b srlv strains, as well as differentiation between them. although the assays were designed mainly on nucleotide sequences from slovenian srlv strains, they were also able to detect a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> srlv strains from abroad . to validate these pcr assays for international use, extensive studies using international samples should be performed.

since not only high specificity but also sensitivity of the assay needs to be assured, the analytical and diagnostic sensitivity of both assays was also evaluated. both assays were highly sensitive, with a reliable limit of detection lower than  <dig> plasmid copies/pcr, being more sensitive than the assays designed by brajon et al.  and li et al. , who reported 102env gene fragments/pcr and  <dig> copies/μl plasmid dna, respectively, and slightly less sensitive than the oppv qpcr assay designed by herrmann-hoesing et al. , which detected from  <dig> to  <dig> ×  <dig> copies/μg dna in naturally infected sheep. on the other hand, the new real time pcr assays performed with less sensitivity when tested with slovenian srlv field samples, since they jointly detected only 79% of samples of elisa positive animals. although the sensitivity of each assay separately could not be determined, since two flocks  were infected with both genotypes a and b and not all srlv strains from seropositive animals were genotyped, based on the results from single strain infected flocks, the caev assay was more sensitive. a decreased sensitivity of both assays was observed in flocks with dual infections. a firm conclusion concerning the sensitivity of each separate assay was thus not possible. similar sensitivities were obtained by brinkhoff et al.  and brajon et al. , whereas herrmann-hoesing et al.  reported a  <dig> % positive concordance of the oppv qpcr. however, comparing the new real time pcr assays with conventional ltr-pcr, which detected srlv in 54% of elisa positive animals , they showed significantly better diagnostic performance. the poor diagnostic sensitivity of pcr assays for srlv detection is due to the low virus load in vivo and the srlv strain variation  <cit> . although in this study an attempt was made to overcome the latter with assays designed on the basis of srlv nucleotide sequences from the slovenian strains under investigation, a firm conclusion on whether the resulting diagnostic sensitivity was low due to the strain variation or the low virus load, was not possible since the sensitivity of the assays using plasmids corresponding to different field strains was not examined. nevertheless, the mvv assay also detected all  <dig> samples from elisa negative animals that were ltr-pcr positive in a previous study  good agreement between elisa and both real time pcr assays jointly was obtained with the kappa statistic  <dig> , which is similar to the agreement for sheep samples with the leader-gag pcr reported by brinkhoff et al. , whereas herrmann-hoesing et al.  reported excellent agreement .

the use of real time pcr in a diagnostic laboratory also requires the assay to be repeatable and reproducible. the new real time pcr assays showed a good level of repeatability and reproducibility, except for the highest dilutions, with an estimated input of virus dna copies equal or below  <dig>  the caev assay exhibited slightly worse repeatability and reproducibility than the mvv assay. intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation of both assays were comparable to the oppv qpcr assay reported by herrmann-hoesing et al. .

following the validation guidelines proposed by bustin et al.   <cit> , the efficiency of the reaction, together with r <dig> and the dynamic range, was also determined to evaluate the performance of the assays. the efficiency slightly varied for the two assays and, in one repeat of the two assays, showed values below optimal in relation to quantitative assays  <cit> . although the efficiency of both assays was not always as optimal as recommended for quantitative methods, it is still satisfactory if the method is used simply for the detection of srlv positive animals. since both assays were developed to detect a broad range of srlv strains, which was only possible using degenerate bases in primers and one probe, optimal performance, as recommended for quantitative methods aiming at a specific target, cannot be expected. the r <dig> values of both assays were higher than  <dig> , which indicates a good correlation between the amount of template and the ct values  <cit> . both assays also had a wide dynamic range of at least  <dig> orders of magnitude. since the two viruses could not be cultured in a higher titre, it could not be determined whether the dynamic range is wider.

in disease control, the price of a diagnostic procedure is crucial. pcr and real time pcr methods for srlv detection in general are hampered by the expensive and time consuming dna extraction procedure from peripheral blood leucocytes. a further disadvantage of the new developed real time pcr procedure is the need to use two reactions for genotyping and the detection of both genotypes a and b. however, the cost was reduced by using  <dig> μl of reaction mix. nevertheless, both assays can be performed in the same run due to the same amplification conditions, thus reducing the time required. furthermore, this report follows the  guidelines proposed by bustin et al. , which ensure the integrity and experimental transparency of studies that are based on quantitative real time pcr protocols. none of the previously published reports describing diagnostic real time pcr assays for detection of srlv have met these criteria. the performance of both assays designed by brinkhoff et al.  was evaluated only in terms of efficiency, while the limit of detection, intra-assay and inter-assay variance were not reported. experiments in relation to efficiency, intra-assay and inter-assay variance were not carried out by brajon et al.  and li et al. . the efficiency of the oppv qpcr by herrmann-hoesing et al.  was also not reported.

CONCLUSIONS
two new taqman probe based real time pcr assays for the specific detection of genotype a and b srlv strains and differentiation between them were developed and validated. validation experiments followed the  guidelines to ensure the integrity and experimental transparency of development of the new assays. the validation results showed that the assays are not only highly specific and sensitive but also repeatable and reproducible. the two new taqman probe based real time pcr assays can serve as an additional tool for confirming infection with srlv and may also be useful for early detection of infected animals prior to seroconversion.
