BACKGROUND
the inter-play between interneurons and pyramidal neurons in the neocortex forms the basis of inhibition and excitation and neural network function  <cit> . interneurons powerfully regulate pyramidal neuron functions, albeit with low synaptic inputs in number  <cit> . recent studies demonstrate that gabaergic interneurons play a critical role in local circuit function and behavior . dysfunction of gabaergic signaling is associated with age-related cognitive decline, schizophrenia, ischemia and alzheimer disease .

nicotine has been found to improve working memory and learning by activating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors   <cit> . emerging evidence has shown that nicotine differentially regulates interneuron and pyramidal neuron activities. for instance, nicotine layer-specifically regulates neuronal activities where distinct interneurons and pyramidal neurons are located  <cit> . while nachrs enhance ampa receptor mediated current and firing rate in interneurons  <cit> , they cause a sustained reduction of nmda receptor mediated currents in pyramidal neurons  <cit> , suggesting an involvement of different molecular mechanisms. although gene profiling studies have made great progress in identifying individual neurons in the cortex  <cit> , and microarray studies have demonstrated that nicotine causes different gene expression in neuroblastoma cell line  <cit>  and in distinct brain regions including the cortex  <cit> , how nicotine may specifically regulate the gene expression in interneurons in relation to pyramidal neurons in cortical circuit remains unknown.

in this study, we acutely isolated cortical somatostatin  labeled interneurons and thymus cell antigen  <dig>  labeled pyramidal neurons in mice treated with saline and systemic nicotine for 14 days, and the transcriptome profiling was compared in sst- and thy1-neuons with or without nicotine. we found that in sst- neurons the most prominent genes affected by nicotine were associated with glycerophospholipid and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, and in thy1- neurons those associated with immune response and purine and pyrimidine metabolisms were influenced. in addition, the differentially expressed genes  between sst- and thy1-neuons were associated with mitochondrial respiratory chain complex after nicotine treatment.

methods
animals
the following mice were used throughout the experiments: gin mice  expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein  in a group of somatostatin-positive interneurons , and thy1-yfp-h  mice  expressing yellow fluorescent protein in layer v pyramidal neurons   <cit> . a previous study has compared the genetic profiling between four lines of mice including gin and yfph used in our study. the authors found that the correlation coefficient between the samples from these two mice was not significantly different, indicating that gin and yfph mice do not show significant transcriptome differences in specific cell types, under basal condition  <cit> . although another major group of interneurons are parvalbumin -positive, they do not express nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the cortex  <cit>  and thus were not chosen in this study.

twelve male mice  were divided into four groups, with  <dig> gin or yfph mice in each group receiving nicotine or saline, respectively. mice were implanted subcutaneously with an osmotic mini pump  that delivered 48 mg/kg/d nicotine hydrogen tartrate  or saline vehicle for 14 days  <cit> . this dosage of nicotine is known to alter neuronal activity and gene expression in the brain of mice  <cit> . mice were housed in the 12/12 h light/dark cycle and were given food and water ad libitum. genotypes were confirmed by pcr analysis before study. all protocols were approved by the commission of chongqing medical university for ethics of experiments on animals and were in accordance with international standards.

brain slice preparation and cell sorting
mice were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital  and decapitated  <cit> . brain slices  were prepared by a vibratome  in ice-cold artificial cerebral spinal fluid  containing : <dig> nacl,  <dig>  kcl,  <dig> mgcl <dig>   <dig> nahco <dig>   <dig> cacl <dig>   <dig>  nah2po <dig>   <dig> dextrose aerated with 95% o2/5% co <dig> . the slices were then incubated in acsf containing 50 μm apv, 20 μm dnqx and 100nm ttx for 30 min at 32 °c and then for at least 30 min at rt. the cortex were morphologically dissected and enzymatically digested by pronase e  in acsf  for 45 min, then triturated by three fire-polished pasteur pipettes  in acsf containing apv, dnqx, ttx and 1% bsa  <cit> . the resultant pieces were allowed to settle for 2 min and the supernatant were collected for centrifugation at 800 g for 5 min, which removed the cellular debris and molecular contaminants  <cit> . fluorescent cells  were carefully aspirated by a micropipette  shaped by a pipette puller   <cit> .  <dig> cells were aspirated each time and  <dig> cells were collected from each mouse. cells  were then transferred to  <dig>  μl lysis buffer containing 2% triton x- <dig> and 5% rnaseout  in nuclease free water and were immediately stored at − 80 °c. a total of  <dig> cells from  <dig> mice in each group were collected for final sequencing. this amount of cells has been proven to be enough to reliably measure the population transciptome  <cit> .

rna library construction and sequencing
smarter ultra low input rna for illumina sequencing kit  was used to amplify cdna from cell lysates, according to manufacturer’s instruction. this kit allows high-quality cdna synthesis in a single cell containing as low as 10 pg rna  <cit> . the cdna library was generated using ovation® ultralow dr multiplex system . the amplified products were quantified by qubit®  <dig>  fluorometer  and validated by agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer . truseq pe cluster kit v <dig>  were used for cluster generation in an illumina cbot instrument. and the sequencing was performed on an illumina hiseq <dig> instrument  following the manufacturer’s protocol. raw reads were performed with base-calling and quality-filtering process and then aligned to mouse genome  using the tophat program  <cit> . differentially expressed genes  were expressed as fpkm , which were filtered by ebseq algorithm, after the significant analysis and false discovery rate  analysis under the following criteria: i) fold change >  <dig> or < <dig> ; ii) fdr <  <dig> , in which the fdr was used to correct p values . gene ontology  annotations from ncbi, uniprotand the gene ontology were used to elucidate the biological implications of degs  <cit> . pathway analysis was used to find out the significant pathway of degs according to kegg  database  <cit> . fisher’s exact and fdr tests were used to select the significant go categories and pathways, and the threshold of significance was defined by p-value and fdr  <cit> . the pathway and gene interaction networks were built based on kegg database  <cit> .

semi-quantitative pcr
reaction mixtures contained of 5 × buffer ,  <dig>  mm each of the dntps, 1 μm primers,  <dig> u phanta® super fidelity dna polymerase , and  <dig> ul of the cdna template was made from the smarter kit. the thermal cycling program for the amplification was as follows: 95 °c for 3 min, 45 cycles of 95 °c for 30 s, 56 °c or 60 °c for 15 s, and 72 °c for 15 s followed by 72 °c for 7 min. the triplicate pcr products were mixed and visualized in a  <dig> % agarose gels. the expression levels were visualized by a chemiluminescence system  and quantified by quantity one software . data were shown as means ± sem . the statistically significant differences between groups were accessed by paired student’s t test using graphpad prism  <dig> software . detailed sequences of the primers were shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

RESULTS
overview of rna sequencing
all samples were subjected to massively paralleled paired-end cdna sequencing. before the read  mapping, clean reads were obtained from the raw reads  by removing the adaptor sequences from each library, reads with >5% ambiguous bases  and low-quality reads containing more than 20% of bases with qualities of < <dig>  of all uniquely mapped reads, about 60% were aligned to the transcript exon, 10% at the intron, 25% at the utr regions and the remaining at tes , tss  and intergenic regions . mapped reads  were distributed consistently on the chromosomes .

to identify the purity of manual sorting, we measured the expression level of genes associated with non-neurons, such as glia, astrocyte, oligodendrocyte, microgila and red blood cells  <cit> . generally, non-neuron marker genes such as glia marker vim, astrocyte marker gfap and red blood cell marker hbb-b <dig> in control groups were expressed at very low level .

nicotine induced degs related to different pathways in sst- and thy1-neurons
there were  <dig> and  <dig> degs  in sst- and thy1-neurons after nicotine treatment, respectively. additional  <dig> common genes shared by sst- and thy1-neurons were both up- or down- regulated by nicotine . pathway interaction network analysis revealed that  <dig> pathways were affected by nicotine in sst-neurons . not surprisingly, nicotine significantly activated nfκb signaling as previous reported  <cit> . the genes associated with cancer and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction were upregulated while those in metabolic pathways were downregulated by nicotine . as shown in fig. 1b, an integrated pathway tree was depicted according to kegg database, in which hyperactive pathways associated with glycerophospholipid metabolism and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism  and hypoactive metabolic pathways  were shown. ppap2b, pld <dig>  pld <dig>  mboat <dig> and lpl were grouped into glycerophospholipid metabolism, and nmnat <dig>  nudt <dig> and nmnat <dig> were categorized into nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, which were all activated by nicotine . among these genes, pld <dig>  pld <dig> and paap2b owned the strongest degree of centrality, suggesting that glycerophospholipid metabolism has a powerful role in sst- neurons after nicotine.fig.  <dig> pathways and functional networks influenced by nicotine in sst-neurons. a up- and down-regulated pathways affected by nicotine. b interaction network of metabolism related pathways. red and green circles represent significantly up- and down- regulated pathways by nicotine , respectively. c network of up-regulated genes involved in glycerophospholipid  and nicotinate and nicotinamide  metabolisms after nicotine treatment. pld <dig>  pld <dig> and paap2b are highly-connected genes with a central role in the network than peripheral genes. c, compound; b, binding/association; a, activation




in thy1-neurons, nicotine affected  <dig> pathways related to abc transporters, calcium signaling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, rheumatoid arthritis, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity and pyrimidine and purine metabolism . it was interesting to note that pathways in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, rheumatoid arthritis, and natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity are all associated with immune response. according to kegg database, gene networks related to immune response  and pyrimidine and purine metabolism  were built. among these genes, csf1r and flt <dig>  nt5e and nme <dig> were considered as the highly-connected genes in immune response  and pyrimidine and purine metabolism , respectively. these results indicated that in thy1-neuons, nicotine significantly increased immune response genes while decreased pyrimidine and purine metabolism related genes.fig.  <dig> pathways and functional networks affected by nicotine in thy1-neurons. a up- and down-regulated pathways affected by nicotine. b network of genes involved in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and calcium signaling pathway. c network of genes involved in the metabolism of purine and pyrimidine. red and green circles represent significantly up- and down- regulated genes by nicotine , respectively. csf1r and flt <dig> , and nme <dig> and nt5e  are highly-connected genes with a central role in the network. c, compound; b, binding/association; inh, inhibition; ubi, ubiquitination




degs between sst- and thy1-neurons under basal condition
there were total  <dig> degs between sst- and thy1-neurons without nicotine treatment . go analysis revealed that these degs were significantly enriched in intracellular signal transduction , nervous system development  and potassium ion transport . small gtpase mediated signal transduction  and phosphorylation  were also significant . the representative genes with the lowest fdr involved in these biological processes were listed in fig.  <dig>  as previously known that nervous system development genes such as neuronal differentiation 1/2/ <dig>  were associated with glutamatergic neuron development in axon outgrowth and glutamatergic synaptogenesis  <cit> . moreover, potassium ion channel subtype genes kcng <dig>  kcng <dig>  kcnq <dig>  kcnip <dig>  kcnh <dig>  kcnj <dig>  kcnj <dig>  kcns <dig>  kcnv <dig> and kcnh <dig> were significantly higher in thy1-neurons, while kcnt <dig>  kcnj <dig>  kcnn <dig> and kcnq <dig> were significantly higher sst-neurons. some of the degs might be cell-type specific. the genes with high expression pattern  relative to low expression pattern  were considered as specific genes  <cit> . the top  <dig> sst- and thy1-neuron specific genes were shown in additional file 8: figure s <dig>  many of these were expressed in a manner consistent with previously published observations  <cit> , while some genes such as thsd7a in sst-neurons and kcnh <dig> and crym in thy1-neurons were not previously reported, suggesting that these genes might represent new marker genes in these neurons.fig.  <dig> top-ranked go terms associated with degs between sst- and thy1-neurons under basal condition. a heat map representation of the top  <dig> genes with the lowest fdr involved in intracellular signal transduction, regulation of ion transmembrane transport and nervous system development, respectively . b representative genes involved in small gtpase mediated signal transduction, potassium ion transport and phosphorylation, respectively . gene expression is shown with pseudocolor scale  with red denoting high gene expression levels and green denoting low gene expression levels. fdr is ranged from a maximum of  <dig>  × 10− <dig> to  <dig>  which is used for the correction of p values




pathway analysis of degs between sst- and thy1- neurons in the absence and presence of nicotine
to further assess nicotine effect on degs between sst- and thy1-neurons, we performed pathway analysis according to kegg data base in the absence and presence of nicotine . as shown in fig. 4a & b, the dges between sst- and thy1-neurons associated with many common pathways remained exist regardless of nicotine application, which included retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, calcium signaling, axon guidance, glutamatergic synapse, cholinergic synapse, morphine addiction and gabaergic synapse, indicating that degs related to these pathways were not affected by nicotine. however, some new degs associated with alzheimer disease , oxidative phosphorylation , parkinson disease  and metabolic pathway  were present only in nicotine treated mice . for most genes associated with ad and pd, significant changes were absent between sst- and thy1- neurons  in normal condition. after nicotine treatment however, these genes were significantly down-regulated in sst-neurons compared with those in thy1- neurons . among these significantly changed genes,  <dig> % in ad pathway and  <dig> % in pd pathway were overlapped and were mitochondrial respiratory chain complex genes, which are closely associated with oxidative phosphorylation. in metabolic pathways, some top-ranked genes were shown in fig. 5b. different from ad/pd pathway genes which showed a clear trend of decrease  in the presence of nicotine, metabolic pathway genes exhibited a complex profile. both significantly decreased and increased genes in sst neurons relative to thy <dig> neurons were found after nicotine . collectively, these results suggested that the relative alteration of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex genes between sst- and thy1- neurons may contribute to nicotinic regulation of neural network function, in which metabolic pathway may also play a role.fig.  <dig> pathways associated with degs between sst- and thy1- neurons in the absence and presence of nicotine. a in animals without nicotine treatment, the top ranked pathways associated with degs between sst- and thy1- neurons are depicted. b in mice treated with nicotine, the top ranked pathways associated with degs between sst- and thy1- neurons are present. some new pathways including alzheimer’s disease, parkinson’s disease, oxidative phosphorylation and metabolic pathway are found in the presence of nicotine. except for metabolic pathway, the degs are significantly overlapped between pathways and are associated with mitochondrial respiratory chain complex

validation of representative genes by rt-pcr
to validate rna-seq findings, we examined the expression level of some hub genes described in figs.  <dig> &  <dig> by rt-pcr. as expected, the expression of dlx <dig> and gdpd <dig> were very low in thy1-neuron relative to the high level in sst-neurons. and dlx <dig> that is necessary for interneuron differentiation and migration  <cit>  was selectively expressed in sst- neurons . consistent with rna-seq findings, ppap2b, pld <dig> and crls <dig> were significantly up-regulated by nicotine in sst neurons. in addition, flt <dig> was up-regulated and entpd <dig> and nme <dig> were down-regulated by nicotine in thy1-neurons .fig.  <dig> semi-quantitative rt-pcr validation of representative degs. a dlx <dig> and gdpd <dig> were specifically expressed in sst-neurons. b increased expression of ppap2b, pld <dig> and crls <dig> are shown in nicotine treated sst-neurons. c nicotine increases the expression of flt <dig>  and decreases that of nme <dig> and entpd <dig> in thy1-neurons. d the densitometry analysis of the rt-pcr results from a, b & c. the expression levels of corresponding genes were normalized by β-actin. data are shown in means ± sem from at least three independent experiments 




discussion
previous microarray studies have shown that in sh-sy5y cells, brief exposure  of nicotine  results in degs associated with  <dig> pathways, in which the toll-like receptor and death receptor pathways involved in immune response were significantly affected  <cit> . on the other hand, chronic nicotine causes regional degs, with prefrontal cortex  and nucleus accumbens  being most responsive to nicotine. the degs induced by nicotine in these areas are involved in phosotidylinositol signaling, calcium homeostasis and neuroprotection  <cit> . in addition, a comparative study reveals that genes involved in protein modification are altered by systemic nicotine in a region specific manner  <cit> . in the present study, we provide evidence that the effect of nicotine on degs is also dependent on distinct cell types. in addition, the relative degs between interneuron and pyramidal neurons might help understand how nicotine regulates brain functions at circuit level.

effect of nicotine on lipid metabolism in interneurons
in our work, pld <dig> , pld <dig> and ppap2b  in interneurons are significantly increased by nicotine. these results are consistent with the notion that glycerophospholipid signaling is affected by nicotine  <cit> . neuronal pld can be activated by variety of stimulators such as neurotransmitters, hormones and growth factors  <cit> . the basic functions of pld are associated with vesicular trafficking, brain development and neuroprotection  <cit> . however, different roles of pld <dig> and pld <dig> in alzheimer disease have been found. while pld <dig> acts as a negative regulator of β-amyloid  formation  <cit> , pld <dig> is required for aβ-induced synaptotoxic action  <cit> . ppap2b is a lipid phosphohydrolase enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidic acid  to diacylglycerol . it also hydrolyzes lysophosphatidic acid , ceramide-1-phosphate  and sphingosine-1-phosphate , thus participating in a variety of cellular signaling  <cit> . ppap2b plays a key role in neuronal development through s1p signaling  <cit> . however, the function of ppap2b in interneurons is poorly understood.

effect of nicotine on immune response and purine and pyrimidine metabolism in pyramidal neurons
an important pathway affected by nicotine is immune response. two genes upregulated by nicotine are csf1r  and flt <dig> . csf1r can be activated by csf <dig> and interleukin- <dig> , thus contributing to innate immunity by regulating the development of macrophage and microglia in the brain  <cit> . flt <dig> regulates vegf mediated angiogenesis  <cit> . it also binds to plgf  that acts as a cytokine and is neuroprotective for cortical neurons  <cit> . these results are consistent with the findings that nicotine regulates innate immune response in neuronal cells  <cit> . the immune responses in the central nervous system are thought to modulate endocrine activity that controls cell migration, thermoregulation, drinking and feeding, among others  <cit> . furthermore, the chemokine mediated neuo-glial crosstalk plays important role in multiple sclerosis and ad  <cit> .

systemic application of nicotine leads to down-regulated genes associated with purine and pyrimidine metabolism, in which nme <dig>  and nt5e  are considered to be highly-connected genes. nme <dig> binds to mitochondrial inner membrane through cardiolipin and is associated with short chain fatty acids metabolism, kreb cycle and apoptosis  <cit> . nt5e is a membrane-anchored protein that catalyzes the extracellular formation of adenosine from amp. this protein mediates the inhibition of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and nociception  <cit> . although the functional consequences of these changes are not well understood, a recent study demonstrates that these genes are abnormally expressed in the brain of parkinson disease  <cit> .

intrinsic transcriptome differences between sst- and thy1- neurons
our study demonstrates that many intrinsic differences between interneurons and pyramidal neurons remain exist regardless of nicotine administration. consistent with previous reports  <cit> , the majority of degs between sst- and thy1- neurons in our study are associated with intracellular signal transduction, nervous system development and ion channel expression and regulation . pathway analysis links these genes to neurotransmitters , neuromodulators  and drug addiction relative to cocaine, morphine and nicotine , suggesting that these degs might contribute to the integrated function of cortical interneurons and pyramidal neurons  <cit> . in addition, we also find some new cell-specific genes, which include thsd7a  in sst-neurons and kcnh <dig>  and crym  in thy1-neurons. the functional role of these genes is currently unknown.

nicotine induces relative degs associated with mitochondrial respiratory chain between sst- and thy1- neurons
major functions of mitochondria in neurons include the regulation of synaptic plasticity  <cit> . our study demonstrates that chronic nicotine causes significantly decreased genes of mitochondrial respiratory chain in interneurons relative to pyramidal neurons, suggesting that nicotine favors pyramidal activity. consistently, ectrophysiological studies have demonstrated that chronic exposure to nicotine results in persistent depression of interneuron, while glutamatergic neurotransmission is always increased  <cit> . at circuit level, nicotine induces gamma oscillations in hippocampal neurons  <cit> , which are associated with the integrated function of pyramidal neurons and interneurons  <cit> . thus, the relative degs between sst- and thy1- neurons might play a key role in nicotinic regulation of synaptic plasticity and network function. unlike mitochondrial genes which show a clear trend of relative decrease in interneurons after nicotine, both the decreased and the increased genes are found in metabolic pathway, suggesting the complicated regulation. example genes in metabolic pathway include nsdhl  dependent steroid dehydrogenase-like), mthfd1l  1-like) and dhrs <dig> . however, the functional role of these genes in neurons is not well-understood.

CONCLUSIONS
is this study, most degs by nicotine are not enriched in sst- or thy1- neurons , suggesting that nicotine might not have significant effect on major transcripts  <cit> . however, the relative changes of mitochondrial genes between sst- and thy1- neurons are highly enriched , which implies that nicotine may play a more prominent role in the regulation of functional balance between interneurons and pyramidal neurons. in addition, although many of the genes affected by nicotine can be categorized into pathways, still the majority of genes cannot be grouped, which does not rule out their functional importance. moreover, the limitation of this study is that nicotinic effect was assessed from two genetically different mouse strains, thus the potential bias of deg results between sst- and thy1- neurons may be existed , as compared to the findings by sugino k and colleagues  <cit> . nonetheless, our study highlights the following findings:  interneurons instead of pyramidal neurons might play a dominant role in nicotinic regulation of glycerophospholipid signaling in specific brain regions  <cit> .  pyramidal neurons might be important in nicotinic regulation of immune response and calcium signaling  <cit> .  the relative alterations of mitochondria related genes may contribute to nicotinic regulation of synaptic activity and neural network function  <cit> . however, the role of the highly connected genes affected by nicotine in individual neurons is currently unknown, which remains to be studied in the future.
