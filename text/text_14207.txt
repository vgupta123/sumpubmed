BACKGROUND
the matlab version of svm-rce can be downloaded from  <cit>  under the "tools->svm-rce" tab.

classification of samples from gene expression datasets usually involves small numbers of samples and tens of thousands of genes. the problem of selecting those genes that are important for distinguishing the different sample classes being compared poses a challenging problem in high dimensional data analysis. a variety of methods to address these types of problems have been implemented  <cit> . these methods can be divided into two main categories: those that rely on filtering methods and those that are model-based or so-called wrapper approaches  <cit> . w. pan  <cit>  has reported a comparison of different filtering methods, highlighting similarities and differences between three main methods. the filtering methods, although faster than the wrapper approaches, are not particularly appropriate for establishing rankings among significant genes, as each gene is examined individually and correlations among the genes are not taken into account. although wrapper methods appear to be more accurate, filtering methods are presently more frequently applied to data analysis than wrapper methods  <cit> .

recently, li and yang  <cit>  compared the performance of support vector machine  algorithms and ridge regression  for classifying gene expression datasets and also examined the contribution of recursive procedures to the classification accuracy. their study explicitly shows that the way in which the classifier penalizes redundant features in the recursive process has a strong influence on its success. they concluded that rr performed best in this comparison and further demonstrate the advantages of the wrapper method over filtering methods in these types of studies.

guyon et. al.  <cit>  compared the usefulness of rfe  against the "naïve" ranking on a subset of genes. the naïve ranking is just the first iteration of rfe to obtain ranks for each gene. they found that svm-rfe is superior to svm without rfe and also to other multivariate linear discriminant methods, such as linear discriminant analysis  and mean-squared-error  with recursive feature elimination.

in this study, we describe a new method for gene selection and classification, which is comparable to or better than some methods which are currently applied. our method  combines the k-means algorithm for gene clustering and the machine learning algorithm, svms  <cit> , for classification and gene cluster ranking. the svm-rce method differs from related classification methods in that it first groups genes into correlated gene clusters by k-means and then evaluates the contributions of each of those clusters to the classification task by svm. one can think of this approach as a search for those significant clusters of gene which have the most pronounced effect on enhancing the performance of the classifier. while we have used k-means and svm to approach this problem, other combinations of clustering and classification methods could be used in approaching similar data analysis problems. yu and liu  have discussed the redundancy and the relevance of features which is a related method  <cit> .

using svm-rce, the initial assessment of the performance of each individual gene cluster, as a separate feature, allows for the identification of those clusters that contribute the least to the classification. these are removed from the analysis while retaining those clusters which exhibit relatively better classification performance. we allow re-clustering of genes after each elimination step to allow the formation of new, potentially more informative clusters. the most informative gene clusters are retained for additional rounds of assessment until the clusters of genes with the best classification accuracy are identified . our results show that the classification accuracy with svm-rce is superior to svm-rfe and pda-rfe, which eliminate genes without explicit regard to their correlation with other genes.

several recent studies  <cit>  have also combined the k-means clustering algorithm and svm but for very different purposes. in a previous study k-means was used to cluster the samples, rather than the features . the sample clusters, represented as centroids, were then used as input to the svm. in this case the sample clustering speeds the svm learning by introducing fewer samples for training. li et. al.  <cit>  also used k-means in combination with svm, but in this case k-means was used to cluster unlabelled sample data and svm was used to develop the classifier among the clusters. however, none of the previous studies used k-means to cluster features and none are concerned with feature reduction, the principal aim of our method. tang et. al.  <cit> , proposed portioning the genes into clusters using the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm. however, this study ranks each gene, in each individual cluster, by svm coefficient weights rather than ranking each cluster as a unit. the size of the clusters, rather than the number of clusters, is reduced. a similar approach has recently been described by ma and huang  <cit>  who propose a new method that takes into account the cluster structure, as described by correlation metrics, to perform gene selection at the cluster level and within-cluster gene level.

the following sections describe the individual components of the svm-rce algorithm. we present data showing the classification performance of svm-rce on complex data sets. we compare svm-rce with the performance of svm-rfe and pda-rfe and demonstrate the superior performance of svm-rce as measured by improved classification accuracy  <cit> .

RESULTS
data used for assessment of classification accuracy
we tested the svm-rce method, described below, with several datasets. the preprocessed datasets for leukemia and prostate cancer were downloaded from the website  <cit>  and used by the study  <cit> . the following is a brief description of these datasets.

• leukemia
the leukemia dataset reported by golub et. al.  <cit> . includes  <dig> patients to be classified into two disease types: acute lymphocytic leukemia  and acute myeloid leukemia .  <dig> of the samples were from all patients . an additional  <dig> cases were from patients with aml. gene expression data was generated using the affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays with probe sets for  <dig>  human genes. data for  <dig> genes remained, after preprocessing following the protocol described by dudoit et. al.  <cit> . for simplicity we will refer to this data set as leukemia. to properly compare the svm-rce performance with previous  <cit>  studies, we split the data into two sets, a training set of  <dig> samples  and a test set of  <dig> samples  as in the original publication and used  <dig> genes. the data was preprocessed by subtracting the mean and dividing the result by the standard deviation  <cit> . for simplicity, we will refer to this data as leukemia .

• prostate
this data set consists of  <dig> prostate tumor samples and  <dig> non-tumor prostate samples. it was generated using the affymetrix platform with  <dig>  genes. data for  <dig> genes remains after the preprocessing stage  <cit> .

• ctcl datasets  and 
cutaneous t-cell lymphoma  refers to a heterogeneous group of non-hodgkin lymphomas of skin-homing t lymphocytes. ctcl includes  <dig> patients and  <dig> controls  <cit>  while ctcl consist of  <dig> patients and  <dig> controls . for more information about the data and preprocessing refer to  <cit> .

• head & neck vs. lung tumors 
gene expression profiling was performed on a panel of  <dig> head and neck  and  <dig> lung cancer  tumor samples using affymetrix u133a arrays. for further information refer to  <cit> .

• head & neck vs. lung tumors 
gene expression profiling was performed on a panel of  <dig> patients with either primary lung  or primary head and neck  carcinomas, using the affymetrix hg_u95av <dig> high-density oligonucleotide microarray. for further information refer to talbot et. al.  <cit> .

the following two sections demonstrate the advantage of the svm-rce over svm-rfe and pda-rfe for selecting genes and accuracy of classification.

performance of svm-rce versus svm-rfe and pda-rfe
the three algorithms, svm-rce, pda-rfe and svm-rfe, were used to iteratively reduce the number of genes from the starting value in each dataset using intermediate classification accuracy as a metric.

we report the accuracy of svm-rce at the final  <dig> gene clusters, and two intermediate levels, usually  <dig> and  <dig> clusters, which correspond to  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes and  <dig> genes respectively. for svm-rfe and pda-rfe we report accuracy for comparable numbers of genes.

the relative accuracies of svm-rce, svm-rfe and pda-rfe are shown in table  <dig>  with the leukemia dataset, we observed an increased accuracy using svm-rce of 3% and 2% with ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> genes, respectively when compared to svm-rfe. comparable results with svm-rfe required ~ <dig> genes. the results obtained from the ctcl  analysis showed an improvement, using the svm-rce of about 11% and 6% with ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> genes, respectively, with a similar performance achieved with ~ <dig> genes using svm-rfe. the second ctcl data set  showed an improvement using svm-rce of about 7%, 11% and 9% with ~ <dig>  ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> genes, respectively.

we also compared results for two additional datasets: head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  and lung squamous cell carcinoma   <cit>  ). svm-rce shows an increase in accuracy over svm-rfe of 8%, 10% and 10% with ~ <dig>  ~ <dig>  and ~ <dig> genes, respectively. a similar dataset comparing hnscc and lscc  <cit>  ) was also subjected to both methods and a ~2% increase was observed, with the svm-rce, using ~ <dig>  ~ <dig>  and ~ <dig> of genes . the prostate cancer dataset yielded better accuracy using svm-rfe with ~ <dig> genes , but similar performances were found at higher gene numbers. the same superiority of svm-rce is observed when comparing the svm-rce with pda-rfe. these results are also shown in table  <dig>  figures  <dig> and  <dig>  of the top genes detected by svm-rce and svm-rfe) use hierarchal clustering and multidimensional scaling   <cit>  to help illustrate the improved classification accuracy of svm-rce for two of the data sets, head&neck and ctcl. the genes selected by svm-rce clearly separate the two classes while the genes selected by svm-rfe place one or two samples on the wrong side of the separating margin.

comparison with li and yang study
recently, li and yang  <cit>  conducted a study comparing svm and ridge regression to understand the success of rfe and to determine how the classification accuracy depends on the specific classification algorithm that is chosen. they found that rr applied on the leukemia dataset has zero errors, with only  <dig> genes, while svm  <cit>  only attained the same zero errors with  <dig> genes. we compared these studies to our results, using svm-rce , where  <dig> error was found with  <dig> genes  and zero errors with  <dig> genes. the one misclassified sample is located at the margin, between the two classes.

tuning and parameters
we have also examined the effect of using more genes  selected by t-test from the training set as input for svm-rce . while no dramatic changes are observed, there is some small degradation in the performance  as progressively more genes are input. a similar observation has been reported when svm-rfe is applied to proteomic datasets by rajapakse et. al.  <cit> .

for demonstrating the convergence of the algorithm to the optimal solution and to give a more visual illustration of the svm-rce method, we have tracked the mean performance over all the clusters for each reduction level. figure  <dig> illustrates the performance on svm-rce for the head & neck vs. lung tumors  dataset over different levels of clusters. the analysis starts with  <dig> genes selected by t-test from the training set that were distributed into  <dig> clusters  and then recursively decreased to  <dig> clusters. the mean classification performance on the test set per cluster at each level of reduction  is dramatically improved from ~55% to ~95% as the number of clusters decreases supporting the suggestion that less-significant clusters are being removed while informative clusters are retained as rce is employed.

speed and stability
the execution time for our svm-rce matlab code is greater than pda-rfe or svm-rfe, which use the c programming language. for example, applying the svm-rce on a personal computer with p4-duo-core  <dig>  ghz and 2gb ram on head & neck vs. lung tumors  took approximately  <dig> hours for  <dig> iterations , while svm-rfe  took  <dig> minutes.

to estimate the stability of the results, we have re-run svm-rce while tracking the performance at each iteration, over each level of gene clusters. the mean accuracy and the standard deviation  are calculated at the end of the run. the head & neck vs. lung tumors  data set with svm-rce has a stdv of  <dig> – <dig> . surprisingly, svm-rfe with the same data yields a stdv range of  <dig> – <dig> . a similar stdv range  was returned when svm-rfe was re-employed with  <dig> iterations. therefore, svm-rce is more robust and more stable than svm-rfe.

k-means is sensitive to the choice of the seed clusters, but clustering results should converge to a local optimum on repetition. for stability estimations, we have carried out svm-rce ) with values of u of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> repetitions , and compared the most informative  <dig> genes returned from each experiment. ~80% of the genes are common to the three runs, which suggests that the svm-rce results are robust and stable. moreover, similar accuracy was obtained from each experiment.

is there an advantage, besides increased accuracy, to using svm-rce for gene selection?
our results suggest that svm-rce can reveal important information that is not captured by methods that assess the contributions of each gene individually. although we have limited our initial observations, for simplicity, to the top  <dig> clusters needed for separation of datasets with  <dig> known classes of samples, one can expand the analysis to capture, for example, the top  <dig> clusters of genes. we hypothesized that by increasing the number of clusters selected that we might be able to identify sample sub-clusters, which may be present in a specific dataset. the ctcl dataset illustrates this possibility. figure  <dig> shows the hierarchical clusters generated using the top  <dig> significant clusters  revealed by svm-rce ) and ) with comparable numbers of genes  identified by svm-rfe. the  <dig> clusters of genes in figure  <dig>  appear to identify sub-clusters of samples present in each class. for example, we see that four samples from the control class  form a sub-cluster identified by the genes tnfrsf <dig>  gab <dig>  il1r <dig> and itgb <dig>  "control sub-cluster" label). three of these  <dig> controls represent a control class  that has been treated with il- <dig>  in addition, a sub-cluster of genes up-regulated in patients  cluster  <dig> patients distinguished as long-term survivors  and  <dig> short-term  survivor from the remaining patients  "lt sub-cluster" label). however, no specific sub-pattern is apparent in figure  <dig> using the top  <dig> genes obtained from svm-rfe. see "additional material file 2: comparison of the ctcl genes selected by svm-rce and svm-rfe and concomitant clustering of genes and samples", which shows additional structure of the data obtained in the classifications with gene clusters obtained using svm-rce compared with svm-rfe. this structure arises because svm-rce selects different genes for the classification.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we present a novel method svm-rce for selecting significant genes for  classification of microarray data, which combines the k-means clustering method and svm classification method. svm-rce demonstrated improved  accuracy compared to svm-rfe and pda-rfe on  <dig> microarray datasets tested.

defining the minimum number of clusters required for accurate classification can be a challenging task. with our approach, the number of clusters and cluster size is determined arbitrarily at the onset of the analysis by the investigator and, as the algorithm proceeds, the least informative clusters are progressively removed. however, in order to avoid producing redundant clusters, we believe that this step needs to be automated to obtain an optimum final value. a number of statistical techniques  <cit>  have been developed to estimate this number.

the rfe procedure associated with the svm  is designed to estimate the contributions of individual genes to the classification task, whereas the rce procedure, associated with svm-rce, is designed to estimate the contribution of a cluster of genes for the classification task. other studies  <cit>  have used biological knowledge-driven approaches for assessment of the generated gene clusters by unsupervised methods. our method provides the top n clusters required to most accurately differentiate the two pre-defined classes.

the relationship between the genes of a single cluster and their functional annotation is still not clear. clare and kind  <cit>  found in yeast, that clustered genes do to not have correlated functions as might have been expected. one of the merits of the svm-rce is its ability to group the genes using different metrics. in the present study, the statistical correlation metric was used. however, one could use biological metrics such as gene interaction network information or functional annotation for clustering genes  to be examined with the svm-rce for their contribution to the classification task  <cit> . in this way, the outcome would be a set of significant genes that share biological networks or functions.

the results presented suggest that the selection of significant genes for classification, using svm-rce, is more reliable than the svm-rfe or pda-rfe. svm-rfe uses the weight coefficient, which appears in the svm formula, to indicate the contribution of each gene to the classifier. however, the exact relation between the weights and performance is not well understood. one could argue that some genes with low absolute weights are important and their low ranking is a result of other dominant correlated genes. the success of svm-rce suggests that estimates based on the contribution of genes, which share a similar profile , is important and gives each group of genes the potential to be ranked as a group. moreover, the genes selected by svm-rce are guaranteed to be useful to the overall classification since the measurement of retaining or removing genes  is based on their contribution to the performance of the classifier as expressed by the score  measurement. similarly tang et. al.  <cit>  has shown that partitioning the genes into clusters, followed by performing estimates of the ranks of each gene by svm, generates improved results compared to the traditional svm-rfe. ma and huang  <cit>  have also shown improved results when feature selection takes account of the structure of the genes clusters. these results suggest that clustering the genes and performing an estimation of individual gene clusters is the key to enhance the performance and improve the grouping of significant genes. the unsupervised clustering used by svm-rce has the additional possibility of identifying biologically or clinically important sub-clusters of samples.
