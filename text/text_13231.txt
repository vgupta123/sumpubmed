BACKGROUND
sweet corn is extensively planted in china and many parts of the world due to its high sugar content and better flavor. china has become the world’s second largest sweet corn production country in  <dig>  <cit> . however, its poor seed vigor easily causes unsatisfied field emergence, which severely limits the production of sweet corn  <cit> . the research on how to improve sweet corn by seed treatment is still lacking  <cit> . therefore, how to improve the seed vigor of sweet corn is particularly important issue to be solved at present. polyamines  including putrescine , spermidine  and spermine  are small aliphatic polycationic nitrogenous compounds. they are considered as important modulators involving in plant growth and development regulation, such as flower, leaf and root differentiation, flower and fruit development, senescence, and germination of seed and pollen  <cit> . arginine decarboxylase , ornithine decarboxylase , s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase , spd synthase  and spm synthase  are five key biosynthetic enzymes relating to polyamine biosynthesis in higher plants, and have already been studied for years in great detail  <cit> . of which, spds catalyzes spd synthesis; while cyclohexylamine , a polyamines biosynthesis inhibitor, inhibits directly the spds activity and leads to the decrease of spd content. pas are usually metabolized by diamine oxidase  and polyamine oxidase   <cit> . hydrogen peroxide  is produced in the oxidation of pas by dao and pao, which is considered to be necessary for plant-developmental processes  <cit>  .

in our previously study, endogenous spd was found to be much more closely related with the seed quality including seed size, dry and fresh weight than put or spm during development of sweet corn  <cit> . therefore, spd was selected for seed soaking in this study. spd is a major triamine among the three pas and takes part in a variety of physiological processes. exogenous spd  had been proven to spur alpha-amylase activity in maize seed and improve seed germination  <cit> . it was also used to enhance the rice seed vigor and reduce the toxicity of salt stress on the rice seed  <cit> . tomato seed primed with spd or spm showed higher germination percentage, seedling vigor and anti-oxidative activity; while put priming decreased anti-oxidative activities in tomato seeds  <cit> . primed seed of white clover with spd solution significantly enhanced the activities of alpha-amylases and beta-amylases, increased the contents of reducing sugar, fructose and glucose and improved transcript level of β-amylase gene. it suggested that the change of starch metabolism induced by spd might be a possible reason for white clover seed vigor enhancement  <cit> .

gibberellins  and abscisic acid  are two important kinds of plant hormones in seed germination regulation. gas mainly involves in seed dormancy breakdown. it had been proven to improve seed vigor and promote seed germination through enhancing endogenous hydrolase activities to weaken the barrier tissues such as the endosperm or seed coat, and through inducing mobilization of seed storage reserves and stimulating expansion of the embryo  <cit> . hedden and thomas  <cit>  reported that terminal steps in ga biosynthesis were mainly catalyzed by gibberellin 20-oxidase  and gibberellin 3-oxidase ; while the ga catabolism was catalyzed by gibberellin 2-oxidase . low-temperature treatment up-regulated the ga3ox activity and down-regulated the ga2ox activity, inducing directly gas accumulation and seed germination improvement of arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . the transcript level of ga biosynthetic gene ga3ox <dig> increased 40-fold in after-ripened seeds  as compared with fresh seeds ; whereas the ga-deactivating gene ga2ox <dig> expressed at the highest levels in the highly dormant seeds of arabidopsis thaliana ecotype cvi  compared with non-dormant seeds  <cit> .

on the contrary, abscisic acid  mainly takes part in seed dormancy maintenance. dormancy is often released in aba-deficient seeds; whereas over-expressions of genes relating to aba biosynthetic enzymes caused easily dormancy aggravation  <cit> . zeaxanthin epoxidase  and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase  are two kinds of aba biosynthetic enzymes  <cit> . it was reported that zep over-expression increased seed aba content and enhanced seed dormancy  <cit> . furthermore transgenic tomato over-expressing lenced <dig> delayed germination and increased aba levels in mature seeds  <cit> . and expression of bean pvnced <dig> in tobacco resulted in delayed seed germination and an increase of aba abundance in transgenic seeds  <cit> . in addition, the abscisicaldehyde oxidase  involving in the conversion of aba-aldehyde into aba was shown to be just highly expressed in vegetative tissues other than reproductive tissues  <cit> .

ethylene  is another important plant hormone which regulates plant development, tissue growth, seed germination and so on. ethylene synthesis from 1-amicocyclopropane-1-carboxillic-acid  is catalyzed by acc oxidase . acc, the direct precursor for ethylene synthesis, derived from s-adenosyl-met by acc synthase   <cit> . kozarewa et al.  <cit>  found that the thermo-dormancy of lettuce seeds was alleviated by the application of exogenous ethylene or its precursor acc. and the amount of ethylene increased rapidly during the germination of crop seeds including wheat, corn, soybean and rice  <cit> . ethylene could accelerate seed germination by stimulating testa and endosperm rupture  <cit> . in addition, it was reported that the inhibitory effects of aba on seed germination could be released by ethylene  <cit> .

spd participates in tissues development processes via interactions with other plant hormones such as auxins, ga, aba and et had been studied  <cit> . however, information regarding spd improves seed germination by interacting with other plant hormones is still lacking.

seed germination begins with water uptake and ends with the emergence of the radical through the surrounding seed tissues  <cit> , which is accompanied by the elongation of the radical and the weakening of the endosperm cap  <cit> . hydrogen peroxide  was shown to be associated with endosperm weakening in lettuce seeds. during seed germination, the h2o <dig> amount and the peroxidase activity in the endosperm cap of lettuce seed increased rapidly; while the endosperm cap puncture force decreased obviously  <cit> . however, whether seed germination improvement by spd is related with the change of h2o <dig> is still need further study.

the purpose of this study was to elucidate further the mechanism of spd promoting seed germination through seed soaking. in present study, the germination test was performed after seed soaking treatments with spd and inhibitor cha. the endogenous pas  contents、pas metabolic emzymes activities and their key biosynthetic genes expressions at the early stage of seed germination  were determined. meanwhile, the effects of spd on metabolism of ga, aba, et and their biosynthetic genes expressions were examined. h2o <dig> and malondialdehyde  productions in embryo were also analyzed. illuminating the possible interactions of spd with phytohormone and peroxide will definitely help us to deeply understand the mechanism of spd in promotion of sweet corn seed germination.

according to the results, spd soaking treatment not only accelerated seed germination of sweet corn but also significantly enhanced seed vigor as compared with the control. on the contrary, exogenous cha significantly inhibited seed germination and seed vigor. cha is the inhibitor of spermidine synthase , which directly inhibits the spds activity and led to the depression of spd content. the depression of spd content in seed embryo induced by cha might be an important reason for the decrease of seed vigor. therefore, spd was believed to play an important role in physiological metabolism during sweet corn seed germination. this is consistent with the results reported by du et al.  <cit> , who found that seed soaking with appropriate concentration of spd could promote seed germination of ordinary corn. besides, exogenous spd was shown to improve rice seed vigor under salt stress  <cit>  and enhance clover seed germination under low temperature  <cit> , which indicated that spd definitely made a positive effect on seed germination.

to test the effects of soaking treatments with exogenous spd and cha on the metabolism of endogenous polyamines in embryos, the endogenous polyamines content, the transcript levels of polyamines biosynthesis genes and polyamines metabolic enzymes activity were determined. it showed that the presence of spd increased the endogenous spd and spm levels of sweet corn seeds, however made no significantly difference on zmadc <dig> and zmspds expressions, and even decreased zmsamdc <dig> and zmspms expressions during seed germination. also the transcriptional levels of zmadc <dig> and zmsamdc <dig> did not respond to spd or cha treatment . in similar with the results of genes expressions, enzyme activity analysis revealed that spd application did not cause an obvious increase in pas biosynthetic enzymes activities, even decreased the spds activity at 12 h of imbibition. thus it was proposed that the increased endogenous spd levels in spd-treated seed embryos might mainly from the exogenous spd permeation other than new spd synthesis. in addition, the present study suggested that the depression of spd and spm contents in cha-treated seed embryos mainly because exogenous inhibitor cha significantly decreased zmspds expression and even zmodc and zmsamdc <dig> transcripts, which leading to the decreased activities of spds, odc and samdc. in discordance with this phenomenon, scoccianti et al.  <cit>  indicated that 5 mm cha treatment resulted in a dramatic increase in the level of put but has little or no effect on the levels of spd and spm in germinating pollen of kiwifruit. therefore, it was proposed that the influence of cha upon pas differs depending on species, organs, physiological processes and even cha concentration.

gibberellins are a family of plant hormones controlling many aspects of plant growth and development including stem elongation and seed germination  <cit> . and the interaction between pas and gas had been studied preliminarily in some species such as arabidopsis and tomato  <cit> . alcázar et al.  <cit>  indicated that the high endogenous spd/spm concentrations in the 35s:atadc <dig> arabidopsis plants were accompanied by a significant drop in atga3ox <dig> and atga20ox <dig> expression as well as reduced ga production. in addition, significantly increased ga2ox expression and reduced ga content was observed in e8:ysamdc transgenic tomato fruits, which accumulated three to four times in spd concentration compared with control  <cit> . however, in our study, we found that the application of spd significantly increased the ga content of embryo via increasing the transcript levels of ga biosynthesis genes zmga3ox <dig> and zmga20ox <dig> in the process of seed imbibition. on the contrary, that the exogenous cha decreased the expressions of zmga3ox <dig>  zmga20ox <dig> and increased simultaneously the expression of zmga2ox dramatically restricted ga biosynthesis. however, the expressions of zmga3ox <dig>  zmga20ox <dig>  zmga20ox <dig> and zmga20ox <dig> did not respond to spd or cha treatment . the results indicated that the increase of ga content in seed embryo of sweet corn induced by spd might be attributed mainly to the increase in both zmga3ox <dig> and zmga20ox <dig> expressions instead of their other family members. and the synthesis of ga in seed embryo might be down-regulated by exogenous cha in transcriptional level. therefore, it was proposed that the influence of spd upon ga differs depending on species, organs and physiological processes.

the interaction between aba and pas during seed maturation and germination had also been studied in detail  <cit> . aba treatment obviously enhanced put and spm but decreased spd content in wheat seeds  <cit> . spm relieved polyethylene glycol -induced osmotic stress by down-regulating aba and antioxidant levels in soybean pods and seeds  <cit> . application of spd did not alter aba levels in radish seedlings under normal growth condition  <cit>  or chromium stress  <cit> , but reduced aba accumulation induced by copper stress in radish seedlings  <cit> . spd accumulation in 35s:atsamdc <dig> arabidopsis leaves inhibited expression of aldedhye oxidase   <cit> ; while enhanced levels of spd and spm in transgenic e8:ysamdc tomato fruits decreased aao <dig> transcripts and increased abscisic acid 8-hydroxylase  <dig> transcripts  <cit> .

in agreement with the reports above, our data showed that exogenous spd significantly decreased zmaao transcripts and the expression of zmnced <dig>  which leading to the decrease of aba levels in spd-treated seeds. on the contrary, the expressions of zmnecd <dig> and zmaao increased obviously after application of exogenous cha, which was accompanied by the increase of aba content during seed germination. however exogenous spd or cha made no significant effect on the expressions of zmnced <dig> and zmnced <dig>  these results suggested that spd improved seed germination and seed vigor to some extent was closely associated with the regulation of ga and aba metabolism at their transcriptional levels. and gene family members had different responses to spd stimulation.

ethylene is wildly involved in leaf epinasty, flower fading, abscission, fruit ripening and seed germination  <cit> . it was demonstrated that exogenous application of pas inhibits ethylene production in plant tissues, and that ethylene inhibits the enzymes activities involved in pa biosynthesis pathway, which might be due to the sam was the common substrate for ethylene, spd and spm biosynthesis  <cit> . however, a much higher ethylene production was observed in e8:ysamdc transgenic tomato fruit, which simultaneously accumulated two to three times in spd/spm concentration compared with the control  <cit> . it was suggested that availability of sam was not rate limiting for the biosynthesis of either ethylene or spd/spm and that these two pathways could run simultaneously.

in the present study, we found an increase in the ethylene level in embryo during seed germination and in response to exogenous spd; meanwhile, the ethylene production was down-regulated by exogenous cha. additionally, the data showed that the transcriptional level of zmacs was up-regulated by spd and down-regulated by cha and the transcriptional level of zmaco1- <dig>  was unaffected. in generally, higher ethylene levels as a consequence of higher expression of zmacs in embryo induced by exogenous spd was closely associated with the seed germination improvement in corn. a similar result was found in transgenic tomato fruit with over-expressed samdc, in which the levels of spd and spm increased, and about two-fold in acs transcripts and higher ethylene level were also found as compared with the wild type fruit  <cit> . it was suggested that exogenous spd might affect ethylene homeostasis by activating the expression of acs during seed germination in corn.

the germinated ability of seeds seemed to be linked to the h2o <dig> accumulation to a critical level  <cit> . and h2o <dig> content was related with endosperm cap weakening and embryo elongation during lettuce seed germination  <cit> . our data showed that exogenous spd increased obviously the h2o <dig> in the plumule and radical in the process of seed imbibition compared with control; while cha decreased the h2o <dig> production. this result might be closely related with the increased pao activity in spd-treated seed embryo and with the significant decreased pao activity in cha-treated one. pao oxidized the carbon at the endo side of the n4-nitrogen of spm and spd, producing respectively n--4-aminobutanal and 4-aminobutanal, as well as  <dig> -diaminopropane and h2o <dig>  <cit> . accordingly, the increased activity of pao induced by spd application might be a critical reason for the accumulation of h2o <dig> in the embryos. however, over accumulation of h2o <dig> easily led to oxidative damage of membrane lipids, proteins and nucleic acids  <cit> . the mda content as an index of oxidative damage degree was consequently analyzed and no difference in mda content was detected between spd treatment and control. it was suggested that the h2o <dig> accumulation induced by spd did not cause an oxidative damage to seed embryo. on the contrary, cha significantly increased the level of mda, which indicated that spd deficiency resulted from exogenous cha application caused a harmful influence on the cell membrane integrity and a stress for sprouts growth. therefore, spd might play an important role in cell membrane integrity maintaining. in addition, linkies et al.  <cit>  found that ethylene had the function on seed germination promotion by weakening endosperm cap. therefore, it was proposed that both ethylene and h2o <dig> were involved in the improvement of spd on seed germination possibly through enhancing endosperm cap weakening and stimulating the plumule and radical elongation.

CONCLUSIONS
that spd contributes to fast seed germination and high seed vigor of sweet corn might be closely related with the metabolism of hormones including gibberellins, aba and ethylene, and with the increase of h2o <dig> in the radical produced from spd by pao . however, the relationship between h2o <dig> and hormones  in the seed germination of sweet corn still needs further research.fig.  <dig> proposed schema for the role of spermidine  in coordinating the seed germination of sweet corn. spd increased gibberellins  contents in sweet corn seeds might through improving ga biosynthetic genes expressions and depressing ga catabolic gene expression respectively. spd decreased abscisic acid  contents in sweet corn seeds might through the depression of aba-synthetic genes expressions. spd also affected ethylene homeostasis by activating the expression of zmacs. in addition, an increase of h2o <dig> content in spd-treated seeds was found, which associated with the endosperm cap weakening and embryo elongation growth. h2o <dig> could also induce a decrease in aba and an increase in ethylene directly or indirectly to accelerate the germination process  <cit>
