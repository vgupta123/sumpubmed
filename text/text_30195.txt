BACKGROUND
intramuscular fat  content and fatty acid  composition are critical aspects of pig meat because of their influence on the sensorial and technological aspects of meat quality such as juiciness, flavor, tenderness and overall desirability of meat  <cit> . consequently, research on muscle lipid deposition is currently one of the most important fields of study in meat science  <cit> . recently, the research interest on this topic includes the complex physiological and genetic mechanisms of imf deposition and gene expression patterns and interactions along development  <cit> .

within skeletal muscle, lipids are stored as droplets both in myofiber cytoplasm and in adipocytes  with imf deposition being highly dependent on the number of intramuscular adipocytes  <cit> . although adipocyte differentiation starts early in fetal stages, the increase in adipose cell number and size is maintained along early postnatal growth and later development  <cit> . imf is considered a late-developing depot because hyperplasia and not only hypertrophy occurs postnatally, as demonstrated in both pigs and cattle  <cit> ; and hypertrophy by lipid filling of adipocytes persists in late stages  <cit> . nevertheless, regulation of intramuscular adipocyte differentiation and growth and triglyceride storage is not completely understood and previous studies suggest that preadipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis exhibit breed-related scheduling  <cit> . among different breeds, the adipocyte depots can be regulated differently, and may have a different propensity to metabolize lipids.

comparison of transcriptome of skeletal muscles and other tissues between phenotypically different pig breeds has been proposed to improve the understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying differences in growth and meat quality  <cit> . several transcriptome studies have compared lean  vs. fatty breeds  . also the duroc breed has been compared to the pietrain lean breed in prenatal stages  <cit>  and to the chinese obese taoyuan breed  <cit> . some of these previous works have been focused on the study of myogenesis and thus different stages of fetal development were studied, since myogenesis is assumed to be a predominantly prenatal process  <cit> . nevertheless, recent work has shown that hyperplastic muscle growth also occurs from birth to weaning in pigs  <cit> .

the iberian pig breed is a fatty breed with clear differences in growth rate, adipogenic potential and meat quality with respect to many other porcine breeds  <cit> . meat and dry-cured iberian pig products, characterized by its high prices, come from two main genetic types: purebred iberian and crossbred iberian with duroc boars. in the crossbred animals, the growth performance and primal cuts yield are improved, but conversely, meat quality decreases because their muscles contain lower proportions of imf and monounsaturated fatty acids , as oleic acid  <cit> . phenotypic differences between both types in lean and adipose tissue growth are visible from early developmental stages  <cit> . regarding the analysis of the iberian pig transcriptome, a comparison with those of large-white and other breeds for several tissues at 3 m of age has been reported  <cit> , but no comparison has been performed on the muscle transcriptome between the iberian and duroc breeds or their crosses.

our objective was to evaluate the muscle genome expression profiles of iberian and duroc × iberian genetic types in order to identify the genes and molecular pathways involved in their phenotypic differences. in contrast to previous studies with extreme breeds, the genetic types here compared share the same production system, being genetically closer and phenotypically more similar. we selected the longissimus dorsi muscle because it is a prime cut of high economic relevance for fresh and cured pork production. muscle transcriptome was studied at weaning , as this developmental stage is highly proliferative and relevant for the differentiation of muscular and adipose cells. additionally, transcriptome information was employed for the identification of transcriptional regulators potentially involved in the different gene expression profiles observed in both genetic types.

RESULTS
phenotypic differences between genetic types
at weaning,  <dig> male piglets  were slaughtered and loin muscle was sampled for composition and gene expression studies. mean live weight at slaughter was  <dig>  kg . there was no significant difference in live weight between both genetic types. the percentage of loin imf was higher in purebred iberian than in crossbred animals . differences in muscle fatty acid composition were also observed, with a higher mufa content in ib and a higher saturated fa content in du×ib . these results confirm the differential trend in fattening and meat quality traits which is evident since this very early growth stage.table  <dig>

transcriptome study: identification and functional characterization of differentially expressed genes associated with pure iberian or crossbred genetic types
among the platforms currently available, the affymetrix porcine array is the most sensitive and reproducible microarray for swine genomic studies  <cit> . employing this platform, we detected  <dig> differentially expressed  probes according to genetic type, exceeding the threshold pp-value corresponding to a fdr <  <dig>   . these correspond to  <dig> known genes. ten de genes were represented by more than one de probe . out of the  <dig> de genes,  <dig> were overexpressed in du×ib and  <dig> were overexpressed in ib. regarding the size of the effects, the de genes upregulated in du×ib ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold-changes, and the ones upregulated in ib ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> .

real-time quantitative pcr  was employed to assess the expression of  <dig> genes , selected to represent different magnitudes of the differential expression detected in the microarray study. twelve out of the  <dig> de genes and one coming from the non-de group were successfully validated as de; and two out of the four non-validated genes  were close to statistical significance . the correlations among gene expression values obtained with microarray and qpcr were significant in  <dig> out of the  <dig> selected genes . overall, qpcr results were in the same direction and similar magnitude compared to the microarray. the elovl <dig> gene showed the lowest agreement between methods, which could be due to the detection of different splice variants, as up to  <dig> different transcripts have been described for this gene in humans. interestingly, the scd gene, which was selected as a control non-de , was observed to be significantly de in the qpcr validation step . the substantial value of concordance correlation coefficient calculated between microarray and qpcr fold-change values for these  <dig> genes  indicates a remarkable agreement between both measures, validating the global reproducibility of microarray results  <cit> .table  <dig>

functions and pathways altered by genetic type were explored by studying overrepresentation of gene ontology  terms on the three main family categories with david tool   <cit>  . most enriched terms were related to main biological processes including: extracellular structure organization, developmental process, lipid metabolic process and muscle organ development. regarding the cellular compartment go category, the extracellular matrix  part was highly enriched in the list of de genes.

the lists of genes upregulated in ib and du×ib were also separately explored . in order to reduce the redundancy, a functional annotation clustering was performed with david tool. genes upregulated in ib affected go terms grouped in three main annotation clusters, which are related to lipid metabolic process, transcriptional regulation and proteolysis . genes upregulated in du×ib affected biological process terms clustered in annotation groups related to development, ecm organization, response to stimulus and cell migration and proliferation . david tool also allowed for the identification of kegg pathways significantly enriched in the list of genes upregulated in each genetic type . ubiquitin mediated proteolysis was significantly enriched in ib, while several kegg pathways were overrepresented in the du×ib type. among them the most significant ones were ecm-receptor interaction and focal adhesion.table  <dig>

the main biological functions identified by ingenuity pathway analysis  in the comparative dataset of the ib and du×ib groups included categories related to cell-to-cell signaling and interaction , lipid metabolism  and small molecule biochemistry . furthermore, transcripts related to lipid metabolism were mainly upregulated in ib group, while transcripts related to cell-to-cell signaling and interaction were mainly upregulated in du×ib group. the specific functions of cell movement/migration and attachment/adhesion of cells were significantly predicted to be decreased in ib samples . the canonical pathways significantly over-represented in the de genes are reflected in figure  <dig> and the most significant interaction networks  are displayed in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  results concerning the separate analysis of the genes upregulated in each one of the genetic types provide potential specific mechanisms to underlie the biological functions and phenotypic traits changing between them.figure  <dig>

the main altered functional patterns observed with the different tools are discussed individually below:

tissue development and ecm organization
among the de genes affected by genetic type we found several widely known ones related to muscle development, including igf <dig> , which is the most significant de gene with seven probes showing differential expression. the growth factor coded by this gene has a major function in muscle promoting fiber differentiation. this locus is paternally imprinted, and a nucleotide substitution in its intron  <dig> has been described, which abrogates in vitro interaction with a nuclear repressor factor. this substitution affects transcriptional regulation in a way that pigs inheriting the mutation from their sire have a threefold increase in igf <dig> messenger rna expression in postnatal muscle  <cit> . this mutation is absent in iberian pig populations and at very high frequency in the duroc sire lines employed for crossing with iberian pigs. in fact, our animals were genotyped for this polymorphism and all du×ib piglets showed the inheritance of the mutant allele from their duroc sire, in agreement with the differences observed in gene expression.

we also found other de genes with roles on myogenesis or muscle development as amyloid beta precursor protein  and fibrillin- <dig> . the app gene has a central role in the most significant gene network detected in this work , related to tissue development. the app appears to promote cell adhesion, acting in an integrin-like manner  <cit> . evidence of interaction with laminin and collagen provides further evidence of adhesion-promoting properties. also studies suggest that peptides derived from the amyloid precursor protein can promote transcriptional activation and can have growth-promoting properties both before and after birth  <cit> . in fact, app-deficient mice obtained by gene targeting are lighter in body mass. the fbn <dig> gene may influence the formation and maintenance of extracellular microfibrils  <cit> , and it has been proposed to play an important role in muscle development being considered a candidate for muscling traits  <cit> . another interesting result is the upregulation in the du×ib muscles of ae binding protein  <dig>  gene, which encodes a member of the carboxypeptidase a protein family. this protein may function as a transcriptional repressor in adipogenesis and muscle cell differentiation, playing a key role in modulation of in vivo adiposity and regulation of energy balance  <cit> . this protein downregulates pten, pparγ <dig> and lxrα expression and transcriptional activity  <cit> , and influence intracellular lipid accumulation. it promotes proliferation of preadipocytes and inhibits their differentiation into mature, fat-filled adipocytes  <cit> .

regarding the functions and pathways affected by genetic type, the most significantly affected biological function, according to all the employed tools, is ecm function and organization, which is narrowly related to tissue development . genes involved in cell adhesion and extracellular structures were found upregulated in du×ib, mainly several integrin and collagen genes and other interacting molecules such as postn, lox, matn <dig> or thbs <dig> . the extracellular matrix consists of a dynamic mixture of structural and functional macromolecules and serves an important role in tissue and organ morphogenesis and in the maintenance of cell and tissue structure and function  <cit> . it has been shown to be very relevant in cellular signalling because specific interactions between cells and the ecm have pivotal roles in the regulation of muscle cell proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . these interactions are mediated by transmembrane molecules, mainly integrins and also other cell-surface-associated components, and lead to a direct or indirect control of cellular activities such as adhesion, migration, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis  <cit> . proliferation determines the pool of muscle cells available for differentiation and thus it influences the potential for muscle growth. moreover, the extracellular environment regulates the proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and satellite cells  <cit> , which can follow adipogenic differentiation thus increasing the intramuscular adipocytes, fibrogenic differentiation increasing connective tissue content, and of course myogenic differentiation which increases muscle mass. thus, function of ecm has relevant influence not only on muscle development but also in future meat quality by affecting intramuscular fat deposition and connective tissue abundance  <cit> .

integrins function as mechanoreceptors and provide a force-transmitting physical link between the ecm and the cytoskeleton and it is proposed that these proteins also regulate angiogenesis  <cit> . there is considerable evidence of the close relationship between developing adipocytes and vasculature, and hence the influence of integrins on angiogenesis may have an impact on adipogenesis as well. in fact, adipogenesis and angiogenesis are reciprocally regulated  <cit> . three different integrin genes were upregulated in du×ib , which show central positions in nw <dig> related to cellular assembly and organization, especially the itga <dig> gene . itga is considered a myogenesis inhibitor which has been suggested to delay muscle differentiation, contributing to a later but higher differentiation of muscle fibers in lean breeds  <cit> , in agreement with our findings. itgav is also related to negative regulation of lipid transport and storage. integrins are narrowly related to collagens and both types of molecules interact in the maintenance of the extracellular matrix. in fact, the de gene itga <dig> encodes the alpha subunit of a transmembrane receptor for collagens and related proteins. six different collagen genes were upregulated in du×ib piglets . collagen deposition in intramuscular locations starts in fetal stages, and this deposition is predictive of collagen deposition in intramuscular locations in growing pigs  <cit> . several works indicate that igf system, pparγ and myostatin may regulate the deposition of collagen in pig intramuscular locations  <cit> . muscle collagen content contributes to toughness of meat, influences texture and is associated with growth rate  <cit> . moreover, collagen development is negatively related to adipocyte development in the ecm: extensive collagen deposition restricts local fat cell clusters growth, and conversely, removal of collagen stimulates the metabolism and survival of adipocytes  <cit> . therefore, the higher collagen gene expression in du×ib muscle is in agreement with the reported higher lean growth but lower meat tenderness and intramuscular fat content of fattened pigs  <cit> .canonical pathways upregulated in du×ib  are narrowly related to the effects on ecm. main signaling pathways are involved in assembly of actin cytoskeleton, cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, cell-cell adhesion and cell motility and growth .

some of our individual de genes have been previously reported to be de between phenotypically different breeds or experimental animals, as igf <dig> <cit> . also, ecm components  and functions have been detected as differential in comparison studies among populations differing in intramuscular fat composition, due to breed or dietary factors  <cit> . these previous results together with the present ones reinforce the ecm biological importance in determining composition and organization of muscle tissue, as well as its significance in the regulation of imf deposition.

lipid metabolism and protein catabolism
the higher lipid deposition observed in muscle of ib pigs , was coincident with the upregulation of genes related to lipid metabolism in this genetic type . most genes were involved in lipid and phospholipid biosynthetic processes  but also some of them had a role in lipid and fatty acid hydrolysis . this is consistent with previous results showing that fatter animals have higher mrna levels for both lipogenic and lipolytic enzymes, with net lipid deposition being regulated by their ratio rather than enhancing only one of these pathways  <cit> . the scd  gene was also identified to be upregulated in ib muscle in the qpcr validation step . this gene is highly relevant regarding meat quality because its product catalyzes the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids from saturated fatty acids. the higher expression of this gene in pure iberian pig muscle is in agreement with the differences in fatty acid contents observed , which constitute the main differential trait regarding tissue composition between the analysed genetic types also in adulthood. ipa analysis also indicated that lipid metabolism was one of the main biological functions in the comparative dataset. moreover, the most significant canonical signaling pathway represented by the genes upregulated in ib  was involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism, inflammation, and cholesterol to bile acid catabolism  and the three metabolic pathways detected are related to the biosynthesis of lipids and fatty acids: triacylglycerol biosynthesis, prostanoid biosynthesis and stearate biosynthesis.

when studying genome-wide transcriptional profile on heterogeneous samples as animal tissues it is necessary to take into account the cellular heterogeneity. any observed differences may be strongly confounded by differences in cell type compositions between samples  <cit> . in this sense, results regarding lipid metabolism genes are consistent with an influence of differential cellularity between genetic types. some of the previously mentioned expression differences are in agreement with an earlier adipocyte development in ib muscles, for instance, the de observed for aebp <dig> gene suggests a higher content of preadipocytes in du×ib piglets vs. a higher content of mature adipocytes in ib. also, the higher expression of lox, collagens and other ecm proteins in crossbred muscles may be related to a higher content of preadipocytes  <cit> . in order to study the potential contribution of this differential cellularity to the expression differences observed, we performed the qpcr quantification of the expression of the preadipocyte marker dlk <dig> gene. this gene is highly expressed in preadipocytes and absent after adipocyte differentiation  <cit> , and it is not present in the affymetrix array. in spite of its low expression level in muscle, we detected significant de in the gene according to genetic type. muscles from crossbred piglets showed  <dig> - fold upregulation . this interesting result joint with the other de genes detected supports the hypothesis of higher content of preadipocytes in crossbred animals’ vs. higher content of mature adipocytes in iberian piglets, and thus earlier adipogenesis in the last ones. on the other hand, a higher lipogenic capacity in muscle of pure ib animals being reflected at the genetic level could be suggested.

gene ontology enrichment and clustering analyses show that protein catabolic processes are significantly enriched in the dataset of genes upregulated in ib . ubiquitin mediated proteolysis kegg pathway is predicted to be upregulated in ib. also, according to ipa, the second main canonical pathway affected by the genes upregulated in ib is protein ubiquitination pathway . the protein ubiquitination pathway plays a major role in the degradation of short-lived or regulatory proteins involved in a variety of cellular processes  <cit> . de genes affecting protein ubiquitination include ube2d <dig>  nedd <dig>  psmd <dig>  cul <dig>  klhl <dig>  asb <dig>  rnf19b, ube2ql <dig>  mylip, march <dig>  apart from this specific pathway which is modification-dependent, gene ontology analysis allows the detection of other proteolytic enzymes as c4bpa, casp <dig>  casp <dig> or ctsl <dig>  ipa also provides a significant gene nw related to proteolysis , composed exclusively of genes upregulated in ib.

protein degradation may be the main cause of the poor muscle development of purebred iberian pigs. according to previously reported results of a comparison with landrace pigs, iberian pigs show about 20-30% greater rates of muscle protein synthesis, but lower relative and absolute weight of biceps femoris, longissimus and semimembranosus muscles than landrace  <cit> . under similar nutritional and physiological conditions, protein turnover as well as the protein synthesis to protein deposition ratio may differ between iberian and leaner breeds, resulting in dissimilar protein deposition rates  <cit> . our results of differential gene expression support this hypothesis and further specify the potential pathways and genes responsible of the metabolic differences observed.

in summary, the performed comparison of the muscle transcriptome of crossbred and purebred ib piglets allows to highlight several important biological functions narrowly related to their respective muscle characteristics. muscle tissue development and ecm organization are strongly upregulated in du×ib, in concordance with greater muscle and connective tissue development, characteristic of this genetic type. genes and functions upregulated in ib are related to lipid and protein metabolism and are also in agreement with phenotypic traits. higher lipid metabolism and protein catabolism are coherent with the higher fattening and lower protein deposition in ib muscles. these results provide potential mechanisms to explain the singular growth and fattening phenotype of iberian pigs, consistent in an earlier adypocite differentiation and hypertrophy and lower protein deposition to synthesis ratio of their muscles. time-course studies of the differential expression along growth would help to improve the understanding of the metabolic and development differences between genetic types here observed.

identification of transcriptional regulators potentially involved in the expression changes between genetic types
the magnitude of differential expression does not necessarily indicate biological significance  <cit> . a very small change in expression of a particular gene may have important physiological consequences if the protein encoded by this gene plays a regulatory role. downstream genes usually amplify the signal produced by this regulator, thereby increasing their chance to be detected as de by standard statistical methods. but the chance of a regulatory gene for being selected is small when focussing on the magnitude of differential expression. regulatory impact factor  metrics have been developed to infer transcriptional regulation from gene expression data by identifying critical regulatory factors  to explain the expression differences observed. rif metrics are not dependent on the differential expression of the rf, increasing the biological knowledge that can be derived from gene expression experiments  <cit> . rif assigns extreme scores to those rf that are consistently most differentially co-expressed with highly abundant and highly de genes , or to those rf with the most altered ability to predict the abundance of de genes . we performed the prediction of rf with extreme rif z-scores for the whole dataset of de genes, and also for the genes included in each of the main gene networks detected with ipa.

a) prediction of regulatory factors for the whole dataset of de genes 
regulatory factors potentially involved in the regulation of the metabolic processes differing in both genetic types were identified by their rif <dig> and rif <dig> z-scores. we performed the rif study for  <dig> rf  included in the filtered array. we identified  <dig> rf with extreme z-scores for rif <dig> and/or rif <dig> parameters . sixteen rf showed extreme values for rif <dig> and sixteen for rif <dig>  klf <dig> showed the most extreme score according to rif <dig> , and zhx <dig> had the most extreme score according to rif <dig> . the genes six <dig>  eya <dig> and klf <dig> were found to have extreme scores for both rif <dig> and rif <dig> table  <dig>

rif metrics allow the identification of relevant rf even not being de. the critical rf identified in this study were not de except max gene, which showed  <dig> × upregulation in the ib group. as expected, rif metrics identified rf which have been previously shown to have an important role in regulating myogenesis and adipogenesis, but also other ones with less known function. myostatin  is a member of the transforming growth factor beta  superfamily that inhibits muscle differentiation and growth during myogenesis  <cit> . its expression is negatively related with muscle mass. in fact, although myostatin is not a transcription factor, it transmits the signal of tgf-beta cytokines activating multiple intracellular pathways resulting in phosphorylation and activation of downstream smad proteins and other signalling molecules . these molecules translocate to the nucleus, bind to dna and regulate transcription of many genes by direct binding to the target gene promoter or through the interaction with transcriptional cofactors in a cell-type-specific manner  <cit> . although we do not detect its differential expression between genetic types, mstn gene is predicted to be a main regulator of the transcriptome differences observed between them. this is in agreement with findings obtained in cattle by hudson et al.  <cit> , which showed that mstn is the rf with the highest evidence of contributing to differential expression in muscle in the absence of any demonstrable differential expression of the regulator itself. gata <dig> transcription factor is crucial in a variety of developmental processes including adipogenesis  <cit> , and a negative regulator of tgfβ- and smad <dig> signaling  <cit> . five rf showing extreme rif <dig> or rif <dig> z-scores have been reported as key regulators of myogenesis, muscle cell differentiation and growth: six <dig> and eya <dig> which show a joint and interactive role on activating key muscle determination genes  <cit> , klf <dig> <cit> , sox <dig> <cit> , and hdac <dig> <cit> . interestingly, three tfs known to be functionally related and involved in transcriptional regulation of cell proliferation are detected as potential regulators. these are the max, mxi <dig> and mycn genes. the mxi <dig> and mycn proteins compete for interacting with max to form heterodimers, which compete for binding to target sites for transcriptional regulation. whereas the mycn-max complexes induce transcriptional activation, the mxi1-max heterodimers repress transcription  <cit> . thus, the balance among the different tfs determines the proliferation and tissue growth rate. also, the cdca <dig> gene codes for another tf which regulates cell proliferation being a target of myc-dependent transcriptional regulation  <cit> . the grhl <dig> transcription factor is involved in development and migration of endothelial cells being considered an angiogenic factor  <cit> , and participates in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization. interestingly, the iroquois homeobox  <dig> gene  is identified in our work as a potential regulator for the gene expression differences observed between genetic types. this gene has very recently been proposed as a novel determinant of body mass and composition  <cit> .

also, rf specifically related to adipogenesis and lipid metabolism were predicted to regulate the expression changes. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator  <dig> β  is involved in fat oxidation, non-oxidative glucose metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, and the regulation of energy expenditure  <cit> . it stimulates lipogenic gene expression by activating srebp transcription factor family. consistently, srebf <dig>  a known gene with role on cholesterol homeostasis and control of lipid levels, is also predicted to regulate the set of de genes. ccaat/enhancer binding protein delta  belongs to the cebp family of adipogenic tf and plays a crucial role in mitotic clonal expansion in the early stages of adipocyte differentiation  <cit> . retinoic acid receptor related orphan receptor alpha  is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of tf related to lipid homeostasis. it influences genes associated with lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, insulin signalling, lxr nuclear receptor signalling, and akt and ampk signalling in mouse skeletal muscle  <cit> . also it influences the expression of srebp and ppargc1b tf. hence, these rf with extreme rif z-scores are important metabolic regulators which could be especially relevant for the differences in adipocyte differentiation pattern, lipid metabolism, energy balance regulation and fat deposition between muscles of both genetic types.

the identification of different rf corresponding to the same pathways  is an indication of the reliability of the results and the involvement of the whole pathways in the expression differences found between the compared genetic types.

the rif approach also gives novel findings regarding functional relationships not previously reported in muscle. not much is known about zhx <dig>  lhx <dig>  pax <dig>  per <dig>  irf <dig>  znf <dig>  elk <dig> or zfp36l <dig> regulatory factors in relation to muscle structure or function, although some of them have known roles on developmental processes in other tissues. also, other ones show key roles in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation and are associated with tumour development as mta <dig>  mn <dig> or dach <dig> 

in order to reinforce the reliability of the rif study, the potential compatibility of the rif-predicted rf and de genes was also explored at the dna sequence level, to analyze the presence of transcription factor binding sites  in the de genes promoters. this study was applied to the dna-binding and sequence-specific transcription factors, which are the ones analyzed by the genomatix software. on average, we detected tfbs for the rif-predicted dna-binding tf in a 60% of the de genes promoters. this software also allowed the identification of tf for which the number of tfbs in the de genes was significantly enriched. the transcription factors mxi <dig>  max, mycn, elk <dig>  grhl <dig>  six <dig>  pax <dig>  srebf <dig> and klf <dig> showed significantly higher number of matches with the promoter sequences than the value expected by chance .

b) prediction of regulatory factors for the main networks of de genes detected with ipa
several gene networks detected by ipa were selected because of its potential role on the phenotypic differences between genetic types, and rif metrics were also calculated for the de genes included in each one of these three main networks.

for the first nw , we detected  <dig> potential regulators . out of them, sixteen were coincident with rf previously identified in the whole dataset study and fifteen rf were new ones. among these, several rf with known roles in the functions affected by this nw can be identified, as myf <dig> which is a main regulator of muscle cell differentiation  <cit> , klf <dig> which inhibits growth, acting as negative regulator of cellular proliferation  <cit> , or ets <dig>  which regulates genes related with development and adipogenesis  <cit> . moreover, some of the network-specific identified regulators have a role in cell differentiation or proliferation .

the relationships found among rf and de genes were separately analyzed for each nw employing ipa and genemania  <cit>  tools. both softwares allow finding relationships in a set of input genes, using a very large set of functional association data, including protein and genetic interactions, pathways, co-expression, co-localization and protein domain similarity. for nw <dig>  all the rf detected with rif algorithm were predicted to be biologically related with the molecules included in the nw, except lhx <dig>  according to genemania each rf was found to be related to a mean of nine molecules in the nw. the genes cebpd, zhx <dig> and rora were the most connected ones.

for the genes included in the second nw ,  <dig> rf were detected with extreme rif scores . most of them  coincide with previously identified ones. among the  <dig> new ones, fosb gene may be highlighted as a regulator of cell proliferation, differentiation and transformation, known to regulate cell-matrix adhesion  <cit> . as for the first nw, most relationships between rf and de genes were confirmed to have a biological support. this nw showed and average number of eight relationships among rfs and de genes, and several predicted rf were connected to many de genes, suggesting a more important regulatory role .

for the third nw , which includes only genes upregulated in ib, we detected  <dig> rf. out of them,  <dig> genes were common with the global study and a few more were detected previously in the other networks, but  <dig> rf were specific for this nw . among these, we can highlight some interesting genes, as etv <dig>  potentially related to energy balance  <cit> , and the hoxa <dig>  hoxa <dig>  hoxb <dig> and klf <dig> genes involved in cellular proliferation and differentiation, cell fate determination and adipogenesis . on the other hand, the identification of mstn and stat5b as regulators of this nw is interesting, as gh effects on muscle growth are known to act via stat5b, which regulates the abundance of mature myostatin by proteolytic cleavage  <cit> . also, several tf related to lipid metabolism are identified . for nw <dig> , all the detected rf were predicted to be significantly related with de genes in this nw. however, most of them showed scarce known connections with the de genes, with a mean number of five connections. only the klf <dig>  zhx <dig> and eya <dig> genes were related to a higher number of de genes according to the available information.

the potential relationship of the rif-predicted rf and de genes was also explored at the dna sequence level using the genomatix software. in each nw, we detected tfbs for the rif-predicted dna-binding transcription factors in a mean of 58% of the de genes’ promoters . the results allowed the identification of tf for which the number of tfbs in the de genes was significantly higher than the number expected by chance. for nw <dig>  the transcription factors mxi <dig>  klf <dig>  klf <dig>  klf <dig> and srebf <dig> showed significantly higher number of matches than expected . transcription factor binding sites for klf <dig> were significantly overrepresented in the set of de genes included in nw <dig> . at last, for nw <dig> the transcription factors mxi <dig>  max, klf <dig> and klf <dig> were highlighted . thus, although this tool is only applicable to sequence-specific dna-binding tf, these results reinforce the previous evidences, highlighting the transcription factors mxi <dig>  max and klfs as the most solid findings according all the available information .

on the other hand, among the rf predicted in the global study of de genes and in each functional nw, we found rf which consistently appear with elevated rif z-scores in all analyses , which may be responsible of a large part of the gene expression differences detected in muscles from crossbred and purebred iberian piglets. a regulatory role of these rf on the main phenotypic differences between the compared genetic types can be thus suggested. also, rf with potential role in specific functions can be identified, as the rf detected exclusively for the proteolysis network, most of which have poorly known roles.

c) differential correlation among rf and de genes in the two genetic types
the correlation structure of gene expression conveys important biological information far beyond the marginal measures of differential expression. in fact, co-expression measures can be used to uncover significant features of cellular control and may help in the determination of gene function  <cit> . rif’s scores measure differential co-expression  between two conditions, which integrates three sources of information: the amount of differential expression of de genes; the abundance of de genes and the change in correlation existing between the rf and the de genes  <cit> . in order to better understand the relationships of the rf predicted with the de genes, we studied the correlations among their expression values in each one of the genetic types. these correlations were calculated for the three functional networks . for the first nw, gene expression correlations were calculated between  <dig> rf and  <dig> de genes . among these,  <dig> significantly differed between genetic types . for the second nw, we calculated in each genetic type the  <dig> correlations between  <dig> rf and  <dig> de genes, with  <dig> resulting statistically different between genetic types . finally, for the third nw,  <dig> rf and  <dig> de genes were employed for the correlation study . in this case  <dig> correlations were significantly different . for nw  <dig>  those  <dig> correlations significantly different between genetic types were represented employing cytoscape  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  .

for the first nw, a higher number of correlations significantly differing from zero were observed in ib piglets’ data . this would suggest a higher activity of transcriptional regulation in purebred animals , in relation to the biological functions affected by this nw. this would be in agreement with the enriched biological function of transcriptional regulation observed in the ib group in the go study with david tool . for nw <dig>  a higher proportion of negative correlations was observed in ib dataset . several rf involved in the regulation of muscle growth, as mstn, rora, six <dig>  klf <dig> or eya <dig>  are negatively correlated with the de genes  in ib dataset, but the correlations are not significantly different from zero in du×ib piglets. this suggests a transcriptional repression in ib animals of genes involved in ecm development and function. in du×ib piglets, some rf correlate with the de genes , with most correlations being positive. in nw <dig>  the differential correlation allows to highlight several rf which show opposite behavior in both genetic types. the genes zhx <dig> and eya <dig> are correlated with several of the de genes in ib but not in du×ib, while lhx <dig> and max show the opposite results. these rf may have a role in the expression differences observed between genetic types regarding proteolytic genes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, purebred and crossbred iberian piglets differing in muscle traits were compared at the transcriptome level, and a remarkable number of de probes were detected. the study of de genes allowed us the identification of biological functions and pathways with relevant role in the differences in development of muscle and intramuscular adipose tissues between the studied genetic types. muscle development and ecm components are clearly upregulated in crossbred piglets, and the results indicate its main role in the differentiation and development of muscular, adipose and connective tissues, and thus on many growth and meat quality parameters. over-expression of lipid metabolism genes in purebred iberian muscle agrees with an earlier adipocyte development in purebred iberian pigs. in addition, proteolysis pathways were upregulated in purebred iberian muscle, with potential negative consequences on protein deposition and lean growth.

apart from measuring differential expression across genetic types, we studied differential co-expression with regulatory factors, thus improving the understanding of the gene expression data and increasing the biological knowledge generated from the experiment. several rf were identified which could be responsible of the transcriptional regulation of muscles of both genetic types. some of them have known roles on myogenesis and cell proliferation  or adipogenesis . also transcriptional regulators for the specific affected functions were identified, which deserve further attention, as ets <dig>  fosb, klf <dig> or pax <dig>  at last, rf prediction and correlation study suggest a transcriptional repression of genes involved in muscle growth and ecm function in muscles of purebred piglets.

results provide candidate genes  to explain the phenotypic differences that characterize the genetic types compared. the identification of polymorphisms responsible for these expression changes would be the following step for the practical application of these findings to improve meat quality.
