BACKGROUND
live recombinant attenuated salmonella-vectored vaccines  have the potential to provide protection against a variety of human non-salmonella pathogens at low cost. by using the salmonella cells to express a heterologous protective antigen, rasvs can induce humoral and cellular immune responses directed at a pathogen of interest  <cit> . rasvs have the additional advantage of stimulating mucosal immune responses, due to their oral route of immunization. oral delivery provides rasvs with the opportunity to invade and colonize the intestinal gut-associated lymphoid tissues , where they actively interact with the host immune system to stimulate robust humoral, mucosal and cellular immune responses  <cit> . to allow the vaccine cells to reach the intestinal tissues more rapidly, human subjects are frequently required to fast prior to immunization as a means to clear the gastrointestinal tract of food  <cit> . however, fasting also causes the gastric ph of humans to fall below  <dig>   <cit> . this poses a non-trivial challenge to the success of the immunization, as salmonella species, particularly s. typhi  <cit> , are not particularly resistant to low ph , and the mutations necessary for attenuation in rasvs often impose additional sensitivity to acid  <cit> . our lab has constructed rasv strains exhibiting regulated-delayed attenuation  <cit> . these s. typhi-derived rasvs, χ <dig>  χ <dig> and χ <dig>  are susceptible to a number of environmental stresses, including low ph  <cit> . to administer an acid-sensitive vaccine strain via the oral route, the vaccine must be given using a strategy that not only actively protects the vaccine cells from gastric acid, but also does not negatively affect vaccine viability or the development of an immune response following vaccination.

most researchers address the problem of low gastric ph by administering an antacid such as sodium bicarbonate prior to the rasv  <cit> . the antacid rapidly neutralizes the gastric acid, allowing the vaccine cells to transit the gastric compartment under neutral or mildly acidic conditions  <cit> . this combination of a liquid rasv formulation with antacid is highly effective and promotes the development of protective immune responses  <cit> . however, bicarbonate is not without problems. in order to efficiently neutralize gastric acid, a surprisingly large volume of bicarbonate must be given, as gastric mixing is not efficient enough to thoroughly disperse small volumes of bicarbonate completely throughout the stomach  <cit> . in addition, bicarbonate has a rather unpleasant taste to most palates and efforts to improve this aspect will positively enhance the experience of the volunteers in a clinical trial or vaccinees receiving licensed vaccines. flavoring agents are sometimes added to vaccine formulations for this reason  <cit> .

in preparation for a clinical trial to assess the three rasv strains listed above, we wanted to investigate the administration of high concentrations of protein as an alternative to bicarbonate. protein is capable of buffering gastric acid and raises the gastric ph within minutes of ingestion  <cit> . as a food-borne pathogen, salmonella appears to take advantage of this gastric acid buffering during infection scenarios. in the presence of protein-rich food, the infectious dose of salmonella is significantly lower than in the absence of food  <cit> . thus, we hypothesized that the administration of protein, specifically ensure® nutrition shakes, immediately prior to and following immunization would provide the same protection from the low ph gastric environment as bicarbonate. using ensure® also provides a carrier with a taste likely to be more pleasant than bicarbonate for most vaccinees. we examined the survival of s. typhi wild type and vaccine strains when suspended in ensure® or a bicarbonate solution and how these compounds, when administered to mice with a low gastric ph, influenced survival during gastric transit.

RESULTS
survival of recombinant attenuated salmonella typhi vaccine strains in bicarbonate and ensure®
to be an effective vaccine formulation, the carrier or co-administered substance must not negatively affect the viability of the vaccine cells. we monitored the effect of bicarbonate and ensure®  on the viability of the three s. typhi vaccine strains and model s. typhimurium strain for four hours . most of the s. typhi strains, including χ <dig>  χ <dig>  isp <dig> and ty <dig>  and both of the s. typhimurium strains we tested underwent a statistically significant increase in numbers when incubated in ensure®, indicating that ensure® could support the growth of these strains. cell numbers of strains suspended in bicarbonate tended to decrease over time, but the decrease was statistically significant only for strain ty <dig>  . interestingly, there were no significant changes in cell numbers for strains χ <dig> and χ <dig> in either bicarbonate or ensure® . there were statistical differences in the numbers of cells recovered from ensure compared to bicarbonate at the  <dig> and  <dig> h time points for a number of strains , primarily due to the fact that ensure® apparently supported the growth of these strains while bicarbonate did not. we also examined survival in vanilla and strawberry ensure® and the flavor did not affect strain viability .figure  <dig>

bicarbonate and ensure® protect vaccine cells during low ph gastric transit
another characteristic of an effective rasv delivery formulation is that it must protect cells from the low ph of the gastric environment. to examine the ability of bicarbonate and ensure® to combat gastric ph, these were used to buffer the stomach ph of mice. because the gastric ph of a fasted mouse is about ph  <dig>  and the gastric ph of a fasted human is about ph 1- <dig>  <cit> , gastric acid secretion was induced in mice by subcutaneous histamine injection  prior to immunization to better mimic the situation in humans. using this protocol, the ph in the mouse stomach is reduced to around  <dig>   <cit> . mice received either bicarbonate or ensure® prior to and immediately following immunization. control mice received no treatment. vaccine viability was measured following gastric transit . compared to the no treatment group, administration of ensure® significantly increased the number of viable cells that reached the small intestine for two of the s. typhi strains and for the s. typhimurium strain , p =  <dig>  for χ <dig> and p =  <dig>  for χ <dig>  this was a 599-,  <dig> - and 647-fold increase, respectively, in the geometric mean number of viable cells to reach the ileum. bicarbonate similarly improved the survival of χ <dig>  and χ <dig>  during gastric transit, resulting in a  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold increase in the geometric mean number of cells to reach the ileum, respectively. administration of bicarbonate did not significantly impact the survival of χ <dig> or χ <dig>  compared to the no treatment controls.figure  <dig>

the ensure treatment was better than bicarbonate at increasing the gastric transit survival of strains χ <dig>  and χ <dig> . interestingly, the survival of strain χ <dig> was not impacted by either ensure or bicarbonate treatments . further, this strain survived gastric transit in mice that did not receive bicarbonate or ensure® somewhat better than the other s. typhi strains  although the difference was not statistically significant .

discussion
the vast majority of clinical rasv trials have made use of sodium bicarbonate as a means to protect vaccine cells from low gastric ph. in fact, field trials with the licensed typhoid vaccine strain ty21a demonstrated that the administration of bicarbonate produced a superior immune response as compared to other vaccine formulation strategies  <cit> . our results are consistent with the idea that ingestion of a buffering substance prior to oral immunization promotes the survival of vaccine cells. the administration of bicarbonate prior to and immediately following immunization significantly improved the survival of both s. typhi χ <dig> and s. typhimurium χ <dig> during gastric transit. interestingly, strain χ <dig> was the most immunogenic, among the three s. typhi strains tested here, in a recent clinical trial  <cit> . sodium bicarbonate is generally regarded as safe, and has been shown to have no effect on the viability of wild-type salmonella  <cit> .

our results demonstrated that high concentrations of protein administered before and after immunization can act as a substitute for bicarbonate. ensure® provided a greater degree of protection from the gastric environment than bicarbonate for s. typhi strain χ <dig>  and s. typhimurium strain χ <dig> , and provided protection equivalent to bicarbonate for s. typhi strain χ <dig> . no effect of bicarbonate or ensure® was observed for the rpos ty <dig> derivative, s. typhi strain χ <dig> .

neither sodium bicarbonate nor ensure® was able to significantly increase the survival of χ <dig> during gastric transit. this is interesting, because of the four rasv strains tested in this study, χ <dig> is the only rpos mutant, due to the fact that parent strain ty <dig> carries a mutation in rpos  <cit> . salmonella rpos mutants are significantly more sensitive to low ph than strains with a functional rpos because they are unable to sustain an acid tolerance response  for more than  <dig> minutes  <cit> . the problem may have been exacerbated by the presence of the Δpfur81::tt arac pbadfur mutation in χ <dig>  as fur and rpos jointly regulate induction of the acid tolerance response  <cit> . the amount of fur present in a Δpfur81::tt arac pbadfur s. typhi mutant is substantially lower than a wild-type strain, regardless of the arabinose concentration during growth and, with regard to survival at low ph, is indistinguishable from a fur deletion mutant . note that strain χ <dig> is also a derivative of ty <dig>  but in this strain, the rpos gene has been replaced with a functional gene from isp <dig> . the s. typhimurium strain χ <dig> has a functional rpos gene, since its parent is rpos+. thus, it is likely that a functional rpos is required in order to benefit from bicarbonate and ensure treatment, at least in this genetic background.

CONCLUSIONS
the ensure® nutrition shake was able to act as a substitute for bicarbonate during oral inoculation to enhance bacterial survival during passage through a low gastric ph compartment. ensure® provided protection better than or equivalent to bicarbonate for all of the strains tested. the failure of both ensure® and bicarbonate to protect an rpos mutant during gastric transit suggests that in future clinical trials, investigators should carefully evaluate the degree of protection necessary for the specific rasv strain being evaluated and perform a careful evaluation of the buffering agent used to neutralize gastric ph.
