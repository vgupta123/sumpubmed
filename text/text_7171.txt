BACKGROUND
melatonin , a hormone produced in the pineal gland and a number of other cells and organs, regulates a number of physiological processes either by its powerful ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species, interaction with intracellular molecules or via activation of the g protein-coupled melatonin receptors, mt <dig> and mt <dig>  <cit> . melatonin regulates the immune system by affecting cytokine production, enhancing the production of several t helper cytokines and modulating the il-2/il-2r system  <cit> . melatonin has been shown to exert a positive effect as an adjuvant of a number of vaccines  <cit> . platelet function is also regulated by melatonin binding to high-affinity sites  <cit> , which results in enhanced platelet responsiveness to physiological agonist and inducing beneficial effects on platelet function and haemostasis  <cit> .

enterotoxemia, caused by clostridium perfringens, is one of the most frequently occurring diseases in all species of domestic animals and humans inducing gastrointestinal and enterotoxemic diseases in animals  <cit> . the bacterium is a normal inhabitant of the intestine where it produces small amounts of toxin that, under normal conditions, are removed by gut movements or are inactivated by circulating antibodies. prepartum vaccination of sheep has been recommended due to the significant increase in lamb antibody concentration compared to lambs reared by unvaccinated sheep  <cit> . in addition, this manoeuvre has been found to reduce the frequency of fecal shedding of serogroup c <dig> salmonellae during the peripartum period  <cit> . here we have investigated the effect of melatonin administration as an adjuvant of the c. perfringens vaccine administered prepartum on the immune response. in addition, we have explored whether vaccination against c. perfringens alters platelet function, as shown for the vaccine against dichelobacter nodosus <cit> .

RESULTS
rectal temperature, as well as the observation of possible local or general adverse reactions, is important for the evaluation of the innocuousness of vaccine or melatonin administration. we have not found any local or general clinical signs, including granulomas, after administration of the vaccine or subcutaneous implants of melatonin in our experimental groups. in addition, the rectal temperature was in the physiological range.

serum concentration of melatonin in the different experimental groups is shown in table  <dig>  in control animals , the plasma level of melatonin was quite stable with no significant changes during the performance of the experiment. vaccination per se had no significant effect on the serum level of melatonin. as expected administration of melatonin by implant induced a significant increase in the serum concentration of melatonin, which was maintained elevated for 60 days and then returned to basal levels in animals with melatonin implant.

melatonin plays a role in synchronizing the reproductive responses of animals to environmental light conditions; it has been reported that serum melatonin levels during human pregnancy are higher than in a non-pregnant state  <cit> . here, we showed for the first time in sheep, the differences in plasma melatonin concentration between non-pregnant and pregnant sheep. as we showed previously, sheep in non-gestational state have an average plasma melatonin concentration of 15 pg/ml  <cit> , considerably smaller than pregnant sheep  . differences in plasma melatonin concentration may be due to strong melatonin antioxidant properties, as well as, as previously postulated, high levels of melatonin during pregnancy may be one of the factors that reduce oxidative damage from ros in the placenta and systemic endothelial cells  <cit> .

plasma antibody concentration in the different experimental groups is shown in table  <dig>  as expected, in control subjects and those treated by melatonin implants the plasma antibody concentration was unaltered during the experiment, while vaccine administration increased significantly plasma antibody concentration reaching the highest level after 60 days of vaccination . as shown in table  <dig>  in animals treated with melatonin implants the concentration of plasma antibodies was significantly greater after vaccination, which further support a positive role of melatonin in antibody production upon vaccination, as described in non-pregnant sheep  <cit> . interestingly, while the effect of melatonin on the serum antibody level after vaccination of non-pregnant sheep was found to be slightly greater but not statistically different from the levels in vaccinated animals in the absence of melatonin  <cit> , when the vaccination takes place prepartum, the serum antibody concentration was significantly greater in vaccinated controls in the presence of melatonin; thus suggesting that the time of vaccination plays a important role in the effect of melatonin on the immune response, being more effective when administered prepartum.

values represent mean antibodies levels as determined by microagglutination assays. data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. of  <dig> experiments. *p <  <dig>  compared with day  <dig>  †p <  <dig>  compared with their respective control in nonvaccinated animals. §p <  <dig>  compared with the application of melatonin implants. †p <  <dig>  compared with vaccinated animals.

melatonin has also been reported to induce a number of immune responses besides antibody production, including enhance antigen presentation to the immunocompetent cells, as described in mice, where melatonin improved antigen presentation by macrophages, by increasing the expression of mhc class ii and stimulated activation of t helper cells  <cit> . furthermore, melatonin may modulate the production of cytokines such as il- <dig>  inf-γ and il- <dig> and increasing production il- <dig> by monocytes as demonstrated in cultured human mononuclear cells  <cit> , thus promoting th <dig> cell response. in addition, melatonin may also bind to high affinity receptors present on th <dig> lymphocytes from human bone marrow thus increasing the levels of il- <dig>  <cit> , increasing the production of il- <dig> and decreasing of tfn-α in mice sensitized with ovalbumin injected with complete freund’s adjuvant, activating the th <dig> response  <cit> .

we have further investigated whether vaccination against c. perfringens  in the absence or presence of melatonin might have any effect on platelet function, and thus, hemostasis. hence, we tested ex vivo platelet aggregation in response to the physiological agonist thrombin in the four experimental groups. the percentage of aggregation upon stimulation with  <dig>  u/ml thrombin decreased significantly after partum in all the experimental conditions . similar results were obtained when we calculated the rate of aggregation . interestingly, the lag-time in response to thrombin was not altered in any of the groups investigated . vaccination or treatment with melatonin did not modify agonist-induced aggregation in sheep during the last stages of pregnancy and postpartum period. we have found that in pregnant sheep serum melatonin concentration is almost  <dig> times greater than in non-pregnant subjects  <cit> . therefore, melatonin administration results in a 2- over 20-fold increase in melatonin concentration in pregnant and non-pregnant animals, respectively, where the serum melatonin concentration reached similar values after exogenous administration.

CONCLUSIONS
we have found that pregnant sheep serum melatonin concentration is elevated as compared to non-pregnant animals. the enhanced level of melatonin in pregnant subjects may be attributed to a physiological effect to avoid oxidative disorders derived from pregnancy, where melatonin could exert an important role as antioxidant preventing platelet hyperactivation, due to its inhibitory effect over cox- <dig> and arachidonic acid-induced aggregation. the lack of effect of melatonin on platelet aggregation might be explained by desensitization of melatonin receptors after prolonged exposure to elevated concentrations of melatonin, as previously reported  <cit> .

the ability of adjuvants to enhance the immune responses to vaccine antigen has long been investigated and the search for adequate adjuvants is critical for improving the performance of existing vaccines, and a role of melatonin as adjuvant has been described  <cit> . our results indicate that melatonin significantly enhanced the immune response to vaccination against the clostridium perfringens type d, which, together with our previous studies in non-pregnant sheep, strongly suggest that melatonin enhances the immune response to vaccination. in addition to our previous findings, here we demonstrate for the first time the beneficial effects of melatonin on the immune response to vaccination when administered prepartum.
