BACKGROUND
the ability to assess genome-wide transcriptional profiles of cells, tissues or even whole organs is a cornerstone of the advances genomics has brought to the life and medical sciences  <cit> . dna microarrays are the major technology used for this purpose  <cit> . both in biology and medicine, important new findings have been revealed by this technology  <cit> . more recently, the microarray quality control  project, a community-wide effort initiated and led by fda  scientists, has made a significant contribution assuring reliability and consistency of dna microarray technology  <cit>  at a time when concerns about repeatability, reproducibility and comparability of microarray results were raised  <cit> . the major message from the maqc project is that microarrays with comparable content show inter- and intra-platform reproducibility of gene expression measurements. major regulatory agencies such as the fda or the european medicine agencies  have recognized genomic technologies, particularly gene expression profiling by dna microarrays, as opportunities in advancing personalized medicine  <cit> . therefore, the results established by maqc are very promising for the use of dna microarrays in drug development, medical diagnostics and risk assessment, and the use of these technologies has been encouraged by the regulatory agencies.

however, as already outlined by the maqc project, an important aspect of dna microarray technology needs further attention  <cit> . advances in array technology as well as improvements of genomic database content will lead to the development of new generations of microarrays in upcoming years  <cit> . the currently available annotation of transcripts represented on dna microarrays  is still incomplete. in fact, our knowledge about gene expression is far from being complete, which is reflected by a continuous increase of content of gene databases such as refseq  <cit> . therefore there have been advances in updating the annotation of microarray probes to the most up-to-date annotation available by providing either new annotation files or software tools for re-annotating existing microarray formats  <cit> . so far, using the most recent dna microarray technology has always been seen as an advantage – especially when searching for novel transcripts  <cit> . however, this might be different in the context of drug development, medical diagnostics or risk assessment, where signatures rather than single genes are of highest relevance. here, unaltered gene annotation and probe sequence content are needed for long-term applications. the potential impact of advances in technology and database content on successfully established diagnostic gene signatures  has not been fully appreciated. it is therefore mandatory to develop approaches and methods that allow fast and decisive assessment of the global impact of database improvements, content changes of microarrays and technical advances.

RESULTS
significant dynamics of gene sequence content of current genome databases
one of the major resources for genomic research are databases such as refseq  <cit> , unigene  <cit> , ensembl  <cit> , or genbank  <cit> . to investigate the underlying dynamics of these databases we performed analyses on both the refseq and the ensembl databases. plotting the official release statistics of the refseq database shows a continuing growth of refseq sequences  mainly explained by constant addition of new species. to determine the development of the content of human gene sequences, human database entries  from the refseq release catalog were extracted. starting with almost  <dig>  hude in release one  the content dropped to less than  <dig>  hude, steadily increased to  <dig>  hude  after which almost  <dig>  hude were added in r <dig>  since then the overall number of hude remained stable . the increase of hude observed from r <dig> to r <dig> can be explained by new knowledge concerning transcript variants , which have been added continuously to the database and have more than doubled since  <dig> . assessing the refseq content of subsequent releases  revealed a surprisingly high number of changes. when performing this analysis on the ensembl database a similar picture occurred. since  <dig> the number of human entries in the ensembl database has continuously grown  with a high number of additions and removals of sequences in between subsequent releases . based on these unexpected and still high dynamics of database content, we hypothesized that the broadly applied microarray technologies, for which refseq and ensembl are two of the main repositories, would be strongly influenced by such changes.

content and annotation of microarrays depends on the repository database
to address the influence of database content on array design and probe content, we used the refseq database as a model and first assessed the impact of different refseq releases on array annotation. here, we define array annotation as the number of refseq hits obtained by all probes on a microarray. as examples for microarray annotation we used three commercially available oligonucleotide-based microarray platforms, the whole human genome oligo microarray distributed by agilent , the human genome survey microarray distributed by applied biosystems  and the human beadchip distributed by illumina    <cit> . for this analysis the most recent versions of the respective microarrays were used. all oligonucleotide probes on each microarray were blasted against refseq releases r <dig> to r <dig> to determine the number of refseq hits for the respective releases. as shown in figure 2b, the number of common refseq hits between two subsequent releases remained constant for all three platforms except for the increase between r <dig> and r <dig> . similarly, when investigating gains and losses of refseq hits  the observed pattern reflected the underlying database changes .

consistency of consecutive array versions strictly depends on database content and annotation
due to the high dynamics in database content and subsequent annotation changes we were particularly interested in characterizing the impact of database content on subsequent array versions. we therefore further investigated the ab-hugsm and the i-hubc arrays. both distributing companies recently launched a second version of their original product: ab-hugsm-v <dig>  and i-hubc-v <dig> . the ab-hugsm arrays are comprised of  <dig>   and  <dig>   oligonucleotides.  <dig>  oligonucleotides remained identical between ab-hugsm-v <dig> and ab-hugsm-v <dig>  whereas  <dig>  were removed and  <dig>  were added . the i-hubc arrays included  <dig>   and  <dig>   probes, respectively  <cit> , but to our surprise, only  <dig>  oligonucleotides remained identical between i-hubc-v <dig> and i-hubc-v <dig> . we postulated that the dramatic differences concerning probe content would greatly challenge comparability of results. to address this issue in detail, we assessed the overall magnitude of changes using i-hubc-v <dig>  and i-hubc-v <dig>  as a model. refseq was used as the annotation database, since both i-hubc-v <dig> and i-hubc-v <dig> were designed based on refseq. we performed a blast analysis on all oligonucleotide sequences from both arrays using three refseq releases  and categorized hits into one of the  <dig> categories presented in figure 3c . r <dig> represents the release at the time of i-hubc-v <dig> design , r <dig> the release at the time of i-hubc-v <dig> array design , and r <dig> the most current release . for r <dig>  we obtained the highest number of perfect hits for i-hubc-v <dig>  as well as the highest number of common refseq hits between i-hubc-v <dig> and i-hubc-v <dig> . also the lowest number of removals  as well as the highest number of additions  was obtained. surprisingly, these numbers changed dramatically when performing the blast analysis on the most recent release r <dig> , reflecting the strong dependence of array content on database content. the analysis based on r <dig>  showed the least agreement in probe level content, as well as the lowest gain of content and the highest number of removals. when running the blast analysis on all official refseq releases  we detected the optimum of concordance at r <dig> and r <dig> , the existent releases at the time of array design of i-hubc-v <dig>  to ensure the reliability of our results we performed the identical analysis on the ensembl database. here we also saw differing concordances between i-hubc-v <dig> and i-hubc-v <dig> depending on the release. however, we did not observe the drastic difference between the release at the time of array design and the most current release, which might indicate a more stable annotation within ensembl .

altogether, comparability of consecutive array versions even on a single platform is a function of oligonucleotide design, database content and annotation available at the time of array design. unexpectedly, optimal comparability is not achieved with the newest annotation of the refseq database but rather with the annotation available at the time of design of the newest array version. as long as the database content is not yet finalized, updates in array design are mandatory to correctly reflect genomic content.

selection of representative data sets for best investigation of performance issues
the above described in silico analysis of consecutive array designs is an important first step to estimate the overall impact on array performance. however, we postulate that site-by-site comparison of performance of consecutive array versions by applying biological experiments is the most critical part of future array development as well as compatibility analysis for long-term projects spanning the life time availability of different array versions. we propose that these experiments fulfill specified criteria . we performed two different sets of experiments. as an example for a biological screening experiment we compared cd25+ cd127- regulatory t cells  as a specialized t cell subpopulation to so-called cd25- cd127+ conventional t cells    <cit> . intracellular staining with foxp <dig> mabs confirmed that cd25+ cd127- cells were indeed treg cells. moreover, quantitative rt-pcr for foxp <dig> mrna revealed high level expression of foxp <dig> in cd25+ cd127- treg cells but not in cd25- cd127+ tconv cells . as an experiment within a diagnostic setting we chose the analysis of peripheral blood samples derived from patients with either scleroderma  or bacteremia . these samples are part of a larger study addressing diagnostic signatures of systemic diseases in peripheral blood . for these samples, we performed microarray analysis on both array types.

i-hubc-v <dig> outperforms i-hubc-v <dig> concerning sensitivity, signal-to-noise-ratio and dynamic range
for further analyses concerning performance issues of two different array versions we cross-annotated the re-blasted probes from the i-hubc-v <dig> and the i-hu-v <dig> arrays bc . to quickly assess improvement of performance by newer generation technology, we assessed  <dig> parameters describing important quality aspects,  the percentage of detected transcripts reflecting sensitivity,  the dynamic range of signal intensities,  the values of background/noise signals reflecting signal-to-noise ratio and  technical replication reflecting reproducibility. in the treg data set, on average  <dig> % of all probes were called present on i-hubc-v <dig> and  <dig> % on i-hubc-v <dig>  similarly, in the whole blood data set, we obtained mean percentages of present calls of  <dig> % for i-hubc-v <dig> and  <dig> % for i-hubc-v <dig> samples . additionally, probes with low signal intensities on both arrays were generally more often called present on i-hubc-v <dig> in comparison to i-hubc-v <dig> suggesting that i-hubc-v <dig> has a higher detection sensitivity . boxplots were used to compare the dynamic range of signals between i-hubc-v <dig> and i-hubc-v <dig>  when plotting the signals of the  <dig>  probes that were identical on both versions, we observed an enlargement of the dynamic range as well as a decrease in median signal intensities on i-hubc-v <dig> for both data sets  which was due to reduced overall background values on i-hubc-v <dig> . analysis of identical oligonucleotides represented on both versions in conjunction with the use of the same crna samples, can be used to assess the performance of both arrays concerning technical replication. when comparing raw signal intensities of such technical replicates we observed increased signal intensities for moderate to highly expressed transcripts on i-hubc-v <dig> . for visualization we used pairwise scatterplots, principal components analysis  and hierarchical clustering on normalized data. samples of the treg data set showed a mean correlation of  <dig>  ±  <dig>   and samples of the whole blood data set a mean correlation of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . these results were confirmed when performing pca using the  <dig> most variable probes out of the  <dig>  identical oligonucleotides . additionally, when performing hierarchical clustering on these samples, almost all technical replicates clearly clustered next to each other .

rank correlation metric reveals significant differences between subsequent microarray versions
to examine the comparability of results across platforms we performed a rank correlation metric  <cit>  and used the ratio of differential expression  as a basis for ranking. in a first step we used transcripts, which were moderately to highly expressed  in either one of the sub-groups of the data sets to eliminate possible impairment due to absent or low expressed transcripts. figure 5a shows the result of the analysis based on the  <dig>  identical oligonucleotides in the treg data set. here,  <dig> transcripts were highly expressed throughout the data set and obtained a rank correlation of  <dig> . when using the cross-annotated probes  the rank correlation dropped slightly to  <dig>  , which can most probably be ascribed to the differences in oligonucleotide placement within a gene . to our surprise, this high comparability could not be achieved for the whole blood data set. here, we obtained a rank correlation of  <dig>  for identical oligonucleotides  and  <dig>  for cross-annotated probes . in a second step we used probes called present in either one of the sub-groups. within the treg data set, we observed a rank correlation of  <dig>  for the identical oligonucleotides and a rank correlation of only  <dig>  for the cross-annotated probes . using the whole blood data set, the rank correlations dropped to  <dig>  for the identical oligonucleotides and to only  <dig>  for the cross-annotated probes . to examine the strong decrease in rank correlation in more detail, we calculated differentially expressed probes between scleroderma and bacteremia samples for i-hubc-v <dig> and determined the corresponding signal values on i-hubc-v <dig> . here, we detected several probes, which were called differentially expressed on i-hubc-v <dig>  but not on i- hubc-v <dig> due to very low signal values in both sub-groups. due to the higher detection sensitivity of i-hubc-v <dig>  these probes were not called absent. to rule out that this difference was intrinsic to the whole blood samples we performed the same analysis for the treg data set. similar to the whole blood data set, several probes showing differential expression on i-hubc-v <dig> were not called differentially expressed on i-hubc-v <dig> and also had low signal values for both t cell sub-groups . among these probes was also foxp <dig>  which is the most important marker of treg cells. as shown in figure 4a, differential expression of foxp <dig> between treg and tconv cells was already confirmed by quantitative rt-pcr as well as intracellular facs analysis to assess protein expression. therefore, at least for foxp <dig>  the data generated with i-hubc-v <dig> reflected real differences between the tested sub-groups while the i-hubc-v <dig> did not. furthermore, blast analysis of the foxp <dig> probes revealed distinct, yet perfect hits , for both i-hubc-v <dig> and i-hubc-v <dig> , suggesting that a functional probe was exchanged by a non-functional.

we therefore propose a comparison approach combining an extended in silico analysis with the experimental analysis . the in silico analysis consists of re-blasting all probe sequences, collecting perfect hits, and categorization of hits. the experimental analysis should include at least cross-annotation, analysis of sensitivity, dynamic range, technical replication and a rank correlation metric. the global impact of upgrading microarray technology and content on any given project can be quickly estimated by this standardized approach.

discussion
most recently, validity and comparability of transcriptional profiling using different microarray platforms has been very elegantly demonstrated by the maqc consortium  <cit> . proving consistency of these technologies when introducing technological advances was suggested by maqc as a major issue for future development. here we have addressed the overall impact of improvements of genomic database content and annotation over time and the impact of technology optimization on major performance issues of a typical microarray analysis. unexpectedly, database content and annotation as exemplified for the refseq database still remains highly dynamic, which by itself has a significant impact on microarray probe annotation. using an in silico approach based on blast analysis combined with categorization of probes and respective cross-annotation approaches, we demonstrate that content changes on a given microarray platform are also influenced by database dynamics. moreover, we conducted a performance analysis combining common quality control measures with a rank correlation metric and show that the inclusion of real biological experiments is mandatory to estimate the overall impact of technology improvements on data consistency. using the illumina beadchip platform as an example, we demonstrate that a large change of probe content between subsequent array versions results in incompatible data in addition to unexpected challenges, such as significant introduction of non-functional probes. this has high impact on biological screening experiments, when signals for known marker genes are lost . even higher impact can be expected for experiments within a diagnostic setting, where content and technology changes will lead to incompatible diagnostic signatures. up to now, using the most recent dna microarray format has always been seen as an advantage, since the most recent version is usually an improvement of the old version. however, this might only be true for the technical performance of an array.

it should be noted that we chose the illumina beadchip over the agilent arrays as an example, since the number of changes between subsequent array generations was significantly higher for this platform. also, we have only used ~ <dig>  cross-annotated probes for performance analysis, which is less than 50% of the content. the reason for this strictness was, in part, based on a recent publication by lee et al. demonstrating high signal disagreement for probes targeting genes susceptible to alternative splicing  <cit> . we therefore limited our analysis to probes with identical targets.

as already outlined by the maqc project, high throughput technologies including microarrays for transcriptional profiling require significantly more attention to quality control and comparability than any test measuring only a single data point  <cit> . the maqc project clearly demonstrated that comparability of microarray technology is already high 1) when restricting the analysis to a comparable set of data points  and 2) when comparing high throughput technologies developed approximately at the same time. here we clearly show that a next important step in genomic sciences will be to quickly introduce standardized general impact analyses to assess newer generation technologies. it would be desirable to introduce the presented approach as a starting point for further projects within the maqc consortium. next steps could be to test the overall impact of the presented approach in the larger consortium and perform such impact analyses on a grand scale respectively when new technologies become available again.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, standardized methods and approaches are critically needed to quickly address the impact of introducing upgrades of high throughput technologies on project content.
