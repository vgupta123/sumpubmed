BACKGROUND
a large proportion of the genes of current cattle breeds can be traced back to a small number of founder animals , mostly influential breeding bulls that have been widely used in artificial insemination  <cit> . as a result, individuals within current cattle populations are closely related. intense artificial selection adds to the declining effective population size   <cit> . in the fleckvieh population, the estimated ne is  <dig>  <cit>  and thus somewhat higher compared to the estimates for other dairy breeds  <cit> . such structures make cattle populations susceptible to the propagation of recessive disorders. the frequency of recessive deleterious alleles may unnoticeably increase and eventually result in frequent homozygotes with a fatal phenotype.

after the implementation of genome-assisted selection in many cattle breeds  <cit> , at least the male breeding animals are routinely genotyped using dense snp arrays in order to estimate their genetic value. comprehensive genotype data also facilitate to unravel the genetic architecture of complex traits  and to rapidly pinpoint genomic regions underlying mendelian traits  <cit> . associated genome regions can be identified in studies involving phenotypically affected and unaffected animals, usually by performing genome-wide association studies followed by autozygosity mapping .

however, large-scale genotype data now also allow to identify recessively inherited diseases without observing affected individuals based on the identification of haplotypes with a deficit in homozygous animals  <cit> . regions with homozygous haplotype deficiency  are likely to harbor deleterious mutations, which may compromise pre-, peri- and postnatal survival in homozygous state. hhd has been identified in several cattle breeds, and causal mutations resulting in early embryonic losses have been postulated  <cit> .

here we report four regions with hhd in fleckvieh cattle. whole-genome sequencing data of  <dig> individuals from five different breeds facilitated to identify putatively causal mutations for two harmful haplotypes. we show that hhd results from early embryonic losses and juvenile mortality, respectively.

RESULTS
homozygous haplotype deficiency in fleckvieh cattle
analyzing haplotypes of  <dig>  fleckvieh animals in a sliding window-based scan revealed four regions with hhd . these regions were denominated fh1-fh <dig>  with fh being an abbreviation for ‘fleckvieh haplotype’. homozygous animals were absent for fh <dig> and fh <dig>  although  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, were expected . insemination success was reduced by  <dig> % and  <dig> % in risk-matings  of fh <dig> and fh <dig>  respectively. this decline is close to the expectation of  <dig> %, when assuming a recessive embryonically lethal mutation and an average insemination success of 50% in fleckvieh cattle .table  <dig>

insemination success, the proportion of stillborn calves and juvenile mortality of descendants from risk matings were analyzed for four haplotypes with a significant deficit in homozygous animals. the physical position of the deleterious haplotypes was obtained based on the umd <dig>  assembly of the bovine genome.



two and three animals homozygous for fh <dig> and fh <dig>  respectively, were observed, although  <dig> and  <dig> were expected . a decline in insemination success  and a reduced first-year survival rate of progeny  was observed in fh <dig> risk matings, indicating both increased pre- and postnatal mortality. insemination success and stillbirth rate were not affected in fh <dig> risk matings ruling out hhd to result from increased pre- and perinatal mortality. however, the first-year survival rate of descendants from fh <dig> risk matings was reduced by  <dig> %  compared to the survival rate of progeny from non-risk matings, indicating increased juvenile mortality .figure  <dig> survival rate of descendants from fh <dig> risk matings. bars represent the first-year survival rate of  <dig>  and  <dig>  descendants from fh <dig> risk  and non-risk  matings, respectively.



genome-wide re-sequencing data reveal two candidate causal mutations for fh2
re-sequencing data were available for  <dig> animals from ten different cattle breeds with average sequence coverage of  <dig>  fold . to identify possible causal variants for the increased juvenile mortality of fh2-homozygous animals, we considered  <dig>  snp and  <dig>  indels located within a  <dig>  mb interval on chromosome  <dig> . haplotype analysis revealed eight  sequenced fleckvieh animals to carry fh <dig>  implying a frequency of the deleterious mutation of  <dig> % in the sequence-derived fleckvieh genotypes . the average sequence coverage of eight fh2-carriers in the fh <dig> region was  <dig>  fold. variant calling yielded  <dig>  variants that were not homozygous for the alternate allele in  <dig> sequenced fleckvieh animals. to account for possible errors in the sequence-derived genotypes  due to low sequence coverage and imperfect ld between the causative mutation and fh <dig>  respectively, we retained only variants that were heterozygous in at least five  sequenced fh2-carriers. this filtering revealed  <dig> candidate causal variants - only two of them were located in coding regions. these variants are a missense mutation  in a highly conserved domain of eif5a <dig> encoding the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5a- <dig>  and a frameshift mutation  in exon  <dig> of slc2a <dig>  encoding glucose transporter  <dig> . both variants are heterozygous in eight fh2-carriers and homozygous for the reference allele in all other sequenced fleckvieh animals. moreover, both variants are homozygous for the reference allele in  <dig> non-fleckvieh animals that have been sequenced for the  <dig> bull genomes project  <cit> .

the p.p19s  variant in eif5a <dig> is predicted to be highly damaging to protein function . differential expression of eif5a <dig> is associated with severe growth retardation and a reduced lifespan in mice  <cit> . p.p19s is therefore a plausible candidate mutation for an increased juvenile mortality. the slc2a <dig> frameshift variant  was confirmed in eight presumed carriers using sanger sequencing. eight nucleotides from the third position of exon  <dig> are replaced by four nucleotides yielding a net loss of four nucleotides . the mutation is expected to alter the reading frame and to change the amino acid sequence from position  <dig> onwards, resulting in a premature translation termination at position  <dig> . the mutated protein should be shortened by  <dig> amino acids  and should lack essential domains for glucose affinity and transport  <cit> . considering the predicted effects of the mutation and the finding that mutations in slc2a <dig> cause a rare recessive disorder with severe growth retardation in humans   <cit> , the frameshift mutation in bovine slc2a <dig> is also a very plausible candidate for an increased juvenile mortality.

of  <dig>  genotyped healthy adult fleckvieh bulls,  <dig> were heterozygous for both, rs <dig> in eif5a <dig> and rs <dig> in slc2a <dig>  with complete ld of the variant sites. consistent with a recessive disease phenotype, none of the healthy animals is homozygous for the mutant alleles .

fh2-homozygous animals are retarded in growth and show liver and kidney defects
two male animals were detected to be homozygous for fh <dig> in the initial scan for hhd. one 15-month old bull was still alive. sanger sequencing of the bull’s dna confirmed homozygosity for the rs <dig> variant in eif5a <dig> and for the rs <dig> variant in slc2a <dig>  the growth of the bull was severely retarded although feed intake was reported to be normal . at the time of admission to the clinic, the bull’s weight was  <dig>  kg, which is half of the weight expected at this age for the fleckvieh breed. clinical examination did not reveal infectious and chronic diseases. body temperature, pulse and respiratory rates were within normal ranges. during the hospitalization period of 50 days, the average weight gain was 330 g/day only, although feed intake and rumination were normal. there were no obvious abnormalities of the digestive system .figure  <dig> phenotypic manifestation of the fh2-associated mutation. photograph of a 15-months old fleckvieh bull being homozygous for the rs <dig> mutation in slc2a2

analysis of urine samples revealed glucosuria and proteinuria as well as an excessive excretion of electrolytes . decreased urine specific gravity indicated renal insufficiency . the measurements of the 12 h water intake  and urine excretion  were approximately twice the physiological values.

analysis of blood parameters revealed an increased glucose level  but normal insulin concentration . the activities of liver function related enzymes  were increased indicating liver cell damage . histological sections of liver and kidney biopsies revealed hepatorenal glycogen accumulation . necropsy findings confirmed liver and kidney defects.

shortly after the identification of the first two animals homozygous for the slc2a <dig> frameshift mutation, we diagnosed an additional  <dig> fleckvieh animals with severe growth retardation that were all homozygous for the slc2a <dig> mutation . two of them, male and female twin calves, were admitted to our research station at the age of 62 days. at 70 kg  and 73 kg  they were underweight, possibly due to twin pregnancy. however, with an average weight gain of ~760 g/day they developed normal until weaning at 132 days . after weaning, the weight gain was only ~450 g/day, i.e. half of the weight gain of healthy animals of the same age. apart from the retarded growth, they didn’t show any other obvious clinical abnormalities.

a nine month old fleckvieh bull with symptoms resembling the condition of the animals examined in the present study was reported in  <dig>  <cit> . inspection of the bull’s pedigree revealed that its sire had been a carrier of fh <dig>  we extracted dna from a formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded liver sample provided by the authors. sanger sequencing confirmed homozygosity for the p.p19s variant in eif5a <dig> and for the p.l258fs <dig> variant in slc2a <dig> 

the fh2-associated frameshift mutation in slc2a <dig> activates cryptic splice sites
the effect of the c.771_778delttgaaaaginscatc variant  on slc2a <dig> transcription was examined by rt-pcr with rna extracted from liver and kidney biopsies of the homozygous animal  and a wild-type animal. using primers in exons  <dig> and  <dig>  we obtained a unique 370 bp rt-pcr product from the homozygous wild-type animal and two rt-pcr products of ~370 bp and ~400 bp from the homozygous mutant animal . the sequence of the wild-type rt-pcr product corresponded to the reference sequence of the bovine slc2a <dig> mrna and the sequence of the mutant ~370 bp rt-pcr fragment matched the c.771_778delttgaaaaginscatc transcript variant . in order to obtain the sequence of the ~400 bp fragment, it was necessary to subclone it. sequence analysis of the subclones revealed three aberrant sequences at the 5′-end of exon  <dig> with fragment sizes of 412 bp , 405 bp , and 405 bp . each of these sequences contained the catc insert that is specific for the mutated variant . mt <dig> is predicted to encode an insertion of  <dig> amino-acids into the second alpha-helix domain of the cytoplasmic loop in glut <dig> , and mt <dig> and mt <dig> to induce a frameshift that severely truncates the resulting protein . bioinformatic analysis  revealed that the c.771_778delttgaaaaginscatc mutation abolishes the consensus nucleotide binding sequences for the serine/arginine-rich splicing factors proteins leading to aberrant splicing sites at exon  <dig> of slca2a .figure  <dig> a frameshift mutation in slc2a <dig> induces cryptic splice sites. schematic representation of exon-intron boundaries of bovine slc2a2

fh <dig> carries a missense mutation in sugt <dig> that is likely to cause early embryonic loss
to identify possible causal variants for fh <dig>  we considered  <dig>  snp and  <dig>  indels located within a  <dig>  mb interval on chromosome  <dig> . eleven sequenced fleckvieh animals are heterozygous carriers of fh <dig>  their average sequence coverage in the fh <dig> region was  <dig>  fold. to account for possible errors in the sequence-derived genotypes due to low sequence coverage  and imperfect ld between the causative mutation and fh <dig>  we filtered for variants that were heterozygous in at least eight  sequenced fh <dig> carriers. this approach revealed  <dig> candidate causal variants. among these,  <dig> variants are located in intronic and intergenic regions; only one variant is positioned in the coding region  and in perfect ld with fh <dig>  all  <dig> sequenced non-fleckvieh animals are homozygous for the reference allele. twelve  sequenced animals from run <dig> of the  <dig> bull genomes project are heterozygous carriers of the alternate allele .

the coding variant  is a missense mutation  in sugt <dig> encoding sgt <dig>  suppressor of g <dig> allele of skp <dig>  sgt <dig> controls kinetochore function during the metaphase of the mitotic cell cycle  <cit> . mutations in sugt <dig> inhibit the g1/s and g2/m cell cycle transitions  <cit>  and may thus cause early embryonic lethality in eukaryotes  <cit> . the p.w317r-variant is predicted to be highly damaging to sgt <dig> protein function . a tryptophan residue at position  <dig> of sgt <dig> is conserved throughout the eukaryotes suggesting that it is essential for normal sgt <dig> protein function .figure  <dig> multi-species alignment of the sgt <dig> protein sequence. the red arrow indicates p.w317r. protein sequences were obtained from ncbi for saccharomyces cerevisia , kluyveromyces lactis , schizosaccharomyces pombe , caenorhabditis elegans , oryza sativa , arabidopsis thaliana , danio rerio , gallus gallus , mus musculus , rattus norvegicus , macaca mulatta , homo sapiens , pan troglodytes , bos taurus , canis lupus familiaris , drosophila melanogaster  and fcanopheles gambiae .



we obtained genotypes at rs <dig> for  <dig>  adult fleckvieh bulls. among these,  <dig> were heterozygous, yielding a minor allele frequency of  <dig> %. consistent with the assumption of embryonic lethality of homozygotes, animals homozygous for the mutant allele were absent in the genotyped sample . we imputed rs <dig> into a larger cohort of  <dig>  adult fleckvieh animals genotyped with 54 k and 700 k snp arrays using  <dig> sequenced fleckvieh animals as reference population  <cit> . after imputation,  <dig> animals were identified as heterozygous and none as homozygous, although  <dig> were expected assuming hardy-weinberg equilibrium .

analysis of inseminations after unsuccessful first inseminations indicated very early pregnancy failure in risk matings. while in risk matings  <dig> % of cows have a consecutive insemination within  <dig> and 32 days after the first insemination, the proportion in non-risk matings is  <dig> % .

attempt to identifying a causal variant for fh3
our scan for hhd revealed that the lack of fh3-homozygous adult animals results from embryonic losses and an increased juvenile mortality. three  animals of the initial scan were homozygous for fh <dig>  however, these animals were not available for phenotyping as they were already slaughtered and died from an unknown cause at the age of  <dig> and 395 days, respectively. analysis of a larger number of genotyped animals revealed an additional five fh3-homozygous calves. three of them died from an unknown cause within 70 days after birth . two live homozygous young bulls were inspected at  <dig> and 277 days of age. both animals were apparently healthy, although one of them seemed mildly underdeveloped . the young bull was admitted to the clinic for in-depth examination. its weight gain during a ~180 days hospitalization period was normal. there were no indications for any apparent diseases.

we sequenced the genome of the fh3-homozygous animal to coverage of  <dig>  fold. the sequence data of the fh3-homozygous animal were analysed together with the sequence data of  <dig> unaffected animals, among them eight heterozygous fh <dig> carriers with average sequence coverage of  <dig>  fold in the fh3-associated region. to identify possible causal variants we considered  <dig>  snp and  <dig>  indels located within a  <dig>  mb interval on chromosome  <dig> . we screened for variants that were homozygous for the alternate allele in the fh3-homozygous animal and heterozygous or homozygous for the reference allele in all other animals. this approach revealed  <dig> compatible variants . the coding variant is a missense mutation in loc <dig> . thirty-eight  sequenced animals including all eight adult fh3-carriers, are heterozygous for rs <dig>  however, this variant also segregates in breeds other than fleckvieh, and two non-fleckvieh animals from run <dig> of the  <dig> bull genomes project are homozygous for the alternate allele.

attempt to identifying a causal variant for fh1
the lack of fh1-homozygous adult animals most likely results from embryonic losses. we inspected  <dig>  snp and  <dig>  indels located within the  <dig>  mb fh1-interval on chromosome  <dig> . assuming strict embryonic mortality, the causal variant should not be homozygous for the alternate allele in  <dig> adult re-sequenced animals. of  <dig>  variants fulfilling this criterion,  <dig> variants were heterozygous in at least three  re-sequenced fh1-carriers  . of these  <dig> variants, nine were never homozygous for the alternate allele in  <dig> animals re-sequenced for the  <dig> bull genomes project. due to their location in non-coding regions of the genome, a functional assessment was not readily possible and therefore not attempted.

discussion
scanning for missing homozygosity in  <dig>  animals revealed four harmful haplotypes in the fleckvieh breed. their frequencies ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. identifying less frequent haplotypes with a deficit in homozygous animals requires larger sample sizes. more than  <dig>  individuals would be necessary to uncover hhd with p <  <dig>  for haplotypes with frequencies below 1%. haplotypes with missing homozygosity due to embryonic lethality have previously been reported for the holstein, jersey, braunvieh, montbéliarde, normande and ayrshire populations , and causal mutations have been identified for some of them . these haplotypes may cause considerable economic loss as they manifest themselves primarily in fertilization failures or abortions.

sequence data of  <dig> animals enabled us to pinpoint candidate causative mutations for two haplotypes with a homozygosity deficit. fh <dig> on bovine chromosome  <dig> affects calf survival. two fleckvieh-specific mutations were perfectly associated with fh <dig>  the rs <dig> mutation is a missense mutation affecting a highly conserved domain of eif5a <dig>  the rs <dig> mutation causes a frameshift in slc2a <dig> and also activates cryptic splice sites resulting in multiple aberrant exon variants. three of them induce premature translation termination. a fourth exon variant encodes an insertion of  <dig> amino-acids in the cytoplasmic loop of slc2a <dig> without inducing premature protein termination but possibly preventing normal protein function  <cit> . mutations in human slc2a <dig> cause fanconi-bickel syndrome , a rare recessive glycogen storage disorder which results in severe growth retardation  <cit> . clinical symptoms, namely growth retardation, laboratory parameters and necropsy findings of an animal homozygous for the bovine slc2a <dig> mutation are similar to those described for human fbs  <cit> . the analogy of the clinical findings to the human condition provides strong evidence that the loss-of-function mutation in slc2a <dig> causes the disease in cattle. however, due to the complete linkage disequilibrium of the slc2a <dig> and eif5a <dig> mutations, the eif5a <dig> mutation cannot be ruled out to solely cause the disease or to contribute to its progression.

unraveling the pathophysiology of the condition most likely resulting from the slc2a <dig> mutation requires a thorough understanding of the function of glut <dig>  the protein encoded by slc2a <dig>  besides facilitating bidirectional fluxes of monosaccharides, glut <dig> may also play a role in glucose homeostasis by sensing blood glucose concentrations, inducing insulin secretion and controlling food intake as shown in mice  <cit> . in fbs patients, glut <dig> deficiency results in high postprandial blood glucose concentration as a result of both reduced glucose uptake in hepatocytes and low insulin secretion, probably due to an impaired blood glucose sensing in pancreatic beta cells  <cit> . in the fasting state, glut <dig> deficiency impedes glucose release from hepatocytes resulting in high glucose concentrations in hepatic cells and low blood glucose levels, which inhibit glycogen degradation  <cit> . insufficient glucose utilization may cause the growth retardation of animals being homozygous for the slc2a <dig> frameshift mutation. however, their development during the suckling period is nearly normal. the high abundance of growth factors including insulin in bovine whole milk  <cit>  may promote growth of affected milk-fed calves and compensate the lack of growth stimuli.

apart from the retarded growth, particularly after weaning, animals homozygous for the slc2a <dig> mutation appear healthy. however, most of them are culled at a juvenile age due to the low growth performance, explaining the lack of fh2-homozygous adult animals. the condition has not been recognized as a genetic disorder so far, although, at a frequency of  <dig> , more than  <dig> affected animals are expected to be born annually assuming  <dig> , <dig> births per year in the german fleckvieh population. interestingly, the disease is not a new phenomenon. it must have been present in the fleckvieh population for at least two decades as the analysis of a historical sample revealed. survey programs for genetic defects in cattle focus on the perinatal period and externally visible traits. they don’t allow for recognizing a genetic disorder without obvious perinatal symptoms, as is the case for the fh2-associated condition. furthermore, here we provide an example for the detection of a disease that compromises calf survival without direct phenotypic clue. to our knowledge, this is unprecedented in a livestock species.

using sequence data we were also able to identify a mutation that is most likely responsible for the harmful fh <dig> haplotype on bovine chromosome  <dig>  fh <dig> affects insemination success in risk matings. the complete absence of homozygous animals indicates an embryonically recessive lethal mutation. a fleckvieh-specific, evolutionarily unlikely missense mutation in sugt <dig> is perfectly associated with fh <dig>  the mutation is expected to affect cell-cycle progression  <cit> . a defect in such a fundamental process of development most likely leads to the very early loss of embryos. it is conceivable that homozygously affected zygotes don’t undergo division at all. thus, the effect of this mutation may manifest itself rather as delayed conception than embryonic lethality. pregnancy is not initiated and the cow enters the next estrus cycle without delay. thus the consequences of the sugt <dig> mutation on cattle fertility are less pronounced than, e.g., of a mutation in umps that leads to embryonic mortality at ~ day  <dig> of gestation  <cit> .

we were able to detect very plausible candidate causal mutations for two of four haplotypes with reduced or missing homozygosity. we think there are four main reasons that we have not been able to uncover plausible causal variants for fh <dig> and fh <dig>  firstly, our algorithm for searching potential causal variants was restricted to well-annotated protein coding regions. causal variants might be of regulatory nature and might reside in not translated intronic or intergenic genome regions. secondly, annotation of the bovine genome is often flawed due to assembly problems or gaps in the reference sequence  <cit> . causal variants located in such regions will be entirely missed or not recognized to affect protein coding. thirdly, disease-associated haplotypes may be in incomplete ld with the causative mutation. fh <dig> and fh <dig> are considerably larger than fh <dig> and fh <dig> for which we identified plausible candidate causal mutations. our data did not allow us to more precisely narrow down fh <dig> and fh <dig>  animals carrying shorter segments of deleterious haplotypes may thus not be detected. furthermore, ancestral haplotypes without the mutation might persist in the population  <cit> . both situations result in the erroneous identification of haplotype carriers. fourthly, structural rearrangements of the genome might be causal for hhd  <cit> . however, detecting structural variants is notoriously difficult in low- to medium coverage re-sequencing data and different approaches for variant detection may yield inconsistent results  <cit> . furthermore, gaps in the reference genome may lead to many false variant calls  <cit> . several animals of the present study were sequenced at relatively low fold sequence coverage . we therefore decided not to apply structural variant discovery.

fh <dig> and fh <dig> compromise insemination success in risk matings, most likely due to early embryonic losses, fh <dig> affects calf survival and fh <dig> compromises both, insemination and rearing success. however, some fh3-homozygous animals reach adulthood without obvious health problems. the unequivocal identification of the causal mutations and affected gene will be prerequisite for an optimal management of fh <dig> as such knowledge will provide clues to the pathophysiology underlying the incomplete penetrance and possibly to a therapy. in any case, our results provide the basis for the highly reliable identification of carriers of all four harmful haplotypes. since most male breeding animals are routinely genotyped for genetic evaluation, the carrier status is directly available for them. the carrier status of the female mating partners can be derived from their genotyped male ancestors. however, genotyping of females would enable a more accurate identification of carrier animals. the consequent avoidance of carrier matings will contribute to better reproductive success and to a reduction of calf loss.

CONCLUSIONS
scanning for missing homozygosity enabled us to identify four haplotypes with a significant deficit in homozygous adult animals. missing or reduced homozygosity results from increased pre- and postnatal mortality of homozygotes. a frameshift mutation in slc2a <dig> is associated with a harmful haplotype that compromises survival of homozygous animals. the mutation impairs glucose utilization of homozygous animals and thereby causes stunted growth. another missense mutation in sugt <dig> is perfectly associated with a haplotype causing early embryonic losses. our results provide the basis for genome-assisted mating programs to avoiding inadvertent carrier matings and to improving reproductive and rearing success in fleckvieh cattle.
