BACKGROUND
the development of drug resistance poses a serious limitation to the effective treatment of cancer. although several different drug resistance mechanisms have been described, members of the abc transporter superfamily have generated great interest because of their contribution to multidrug resistance of tumor <cit> . the  <dig> kda p-glycoprotein, encoded by the mdr <dig> gene, was the first member of this family to be described  <cit> . subsequently, the 190-kda multidrug resistance-associated protein- <dig>  was isolated from a multidrug resistance lung cancer cell line that does not express mdr <dig>  <cit> . both these transporters have been implicated in the resistance of various cancers to chemotherapy. although mrp <dig> is only 18% identical to mdr <dig> at the amino acid level, it transports several similar drugs as mdr <dig> including doxorubicin, vincristine and colchicine. however, while drugs transported by mdr <dig> are usually neutral or cationic, drugs effluxed by mrp <dig> are anionic, frequently conjugated with glutathione and other anions, or are co-transported with glutathione  <cit> . mrp <dig> has also been implicated to play important roles in cellular anti-oxidative defense and inflammation  <cit> .

mrp <dig> is located on chromosome  <dig> at band  <dig>  and spans approximately  <dig> kb. it contains  <dig> exons and encodes  <dig> amino acids. the mrp <dig> protein is predicted to comprise three membrane spanning domains  and two nucleotide binding domains   <cit> .

genetic polymorphisms in mdr <dig> have been associated with differences in mdr <dig> expression and function as well as drug response and disease susceptibilities  <cit> . snps within mdr <dig> that have been associated with functional differences were found to demonstrate evidence of recent positive selection  <cit> . however, less is known about the polymorphisms within mrp <dig>  although numerous snps have been identified within this gene. of mrp <dig> in a caucasian population and demonstrated that this snp altered mrp <dig> promoter activity  <cit> .

in the present study, we sequenced all the exons as well as the 5' and 3' flanking regions of mrp <dig> to comprehensively scan for polymorphisms in  <dig> dna samples from four different populations, namely, the chinese, malays, indians and caucasians. nucleotide diversity of the exonic polymorphisms was determined and the functional effects of the non-synonymous snps were predicted using three programs, sift, polyphen and panther. we found that snps e10/1299g>t, which resulted in arginine-serine substitution at amino acid position  <dig>  and e16/2012g>t, which resulted in glycine-valine substitution at amino acid position  <dig> , may potentially adversely affect the function of mrp <dig>  while these two snps, which have low minor allele frequencies , may not be useful for studies associating this gene with common diseases/drug response, it may, nonetheless, be useful for studies associating this gene with rare events including adverse drug reactions .

RESULTS
profile of polymorphisms within mrp <dig> in the different populations
de novo sequencing of approximately  <dig> kb of genomic dna at mrp <dig>  including all the  <dig> exons as well as flanking regions, was performed in  <dig> healthy individuals from four different populations to identify polymorphisms at mrp <dig> in the different populations. a total of  <dig> polymorphisms were identified including  <dig> bi-allelic snps, ten indels and one short tandem repeat  . an examination of currently reported snps in the dbsnp build  <dig> database  <cit>  and published reports  <cit>  revealed that  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels were not previously reported and hence represent novel polymorphisms.

nineteen of the  <dig> snps identified were found in all four populations while  <dig> of these snps were population-specific with  <dig> of these population-specific snps occurring only once out of  <dig> chromosomes examined . while the str and two indels were polymorphic in all the populations examined, the other seven indels were population-specific of which six were singletons.

none of the indels or str identified occurred within exons . eighteen of the  <dig> bi-allelic snps were found in exonic regions, six of which resulted in non-synonymous change . these results suggest that polymorphisms at mrp <dig> are largely conservative since less than 10% of these polymorphisms  presented as non-synonymous changes which are potentially capable of disrupting the mrp <dig> protein structure/function. nonetheless, it is possible for synonymous or intronic snps to affect mrp <dig> expression or function through the alteration of the mrna transcript stability or folding  <cit>  thereby affecting downstream splicing <cit> , processing <cit> , translational control  <cit>  or regulation  <cit> . additionally, polymorphisms at the 5'utr/promoter and 3'utr may influence promoter activity and hence gene expression or mrna transcript stability.

interestingly, although no polymorphisms were identified at the 3'utr region , four polymorphisms, including the str  and one indel  were found to reside at the 5'utr/reported core promoter region  <cit>  of mrp <dig>  three of these promoter polymorphisms were novel but population-specific with snps 5'utr/-46c>t and 5'utr/-51c>t occurring only in the malay population and the polymorphism 5'utr/- <dig>  <dig> bp indel occurring only in the indian population. insertion/deletion polymorphisms in promoter regions have been correlated with the modulation of the expression of genes . it is thus possible that the  <dig> bp indel polymorphism in the indian population may influence the promoter activity and hence the expression of mrp <dig> 

the str polymorphism found at the 5'utr/promoter region of mrp <dig> is a gcc trinucleotide repeat and 7â€“ <dig> of such repeats were observed in the four populations . the most commonly occurring gcc repeat number in all the four populations was  <dig> which occurred at a frequency of  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % in the chinese, malay, indian and caucasian populations, respectively. eleven gcc repeats also occurred at high frequencies  in most of the populations except the caucasians. interestingly, while seven gcc repeats occurred at relatively high frequencies in the indian and caucasian populations , this number of repeats was not observed in either the chinese or malay population. these observations highlight the differences in the distribution of the number of the mrp <dig> promoter gcc repeats in the different populations with the indians and caucasians being more similar to each other than to the chinese and malays. the number of str repeats residing within or close to promoters has been found to modulate the promoter activity of genes  <cit> . interestingly, differences in the cgg and gcc trinucleotide repeats at the 5'utr/promoter region of the fragile x mental retardation genes  have been associated with differences in the methylation status of the promoter and expression of the genes  <cit> . hence this common polymorphism at the 5'utr/promoter region of mrp <dig> with distinctly different distribution of repeat numbers in the different population may have potential functional significance.

comparison of polymorphisms identified in this study with those reported in the hapmap and perlegen databases
two publicly available databases hapmap  <cit>  and perlegen  <cit>  examined genome-wide polymorphisms  in several populations. hapmap genotyped already known snps from public databases at a density of approximately one snp per  <dig> kb of dna in  <dig> different populations namely,  <dig> japanese from tokyo,  <dig> chinese from beijing ,  <dig> us residents with northern and western european ancestry by the centre d'etude du polymorphisme humain  and  <dig> yoruba people of ibadan . approximately  <dig>  million snps from  <dig> han chinese ,  <dig> european american  and  <dig> african american  were successfully genotyped in the perlegen project. the snps genotyped in the perlegen project were either reported in public databases or identified through their array-based re-sequencing of  <dig> human samples of diverse ancestry  <cit> . we thus compared the polymorphisms at the mrp <dig> gene that we identified through de novo sequencing of dna samples from  <dig> individuals of  <dig> different populations with those reported in the hapmap and perlegen databases. of the populations examined in hapmap and perlegen, only two populations, namely the chb and ceph/ea, were similar to the populations that we studied. as shown in table 5a, only  <dig> and  <dig> polymorphisms that we identified were also genotyped in the hapmap and perlegen projects. curiously, 25/ <dig> and 1/ <dig> polymorphisms reported in hapmap and perlegen, respectively, were found to be monomorphic in similar populations that we examined. nonetheless, all the snps examined in the two databases that did not occur in our populations were found to be either monomorphic or of low frequency  in similar populations examined in the two databases . on the other hand, 41/ <dig> and 46/ <dig> polymorphisms that we identified were not examined in either the hapmap or the perlegen project, respectively. while many of these polymorphisms were of low frequencies or were monomorphic in the two populations that were similar to the hapmap/perlegen populations,  <dig> of these polymorphisms were found to be of relatively high frequencies  in at least one of the two populations. some of the low frequency polymorphisms represent novel snps identified in this study.

polymorphisms in our study that was also genotyped in the hapmap and perlegen projects were found to have similar frequencies in similar populations . paired t-test revealed no significant difference  between allele frequencies in the respective populations from our study and those from the hapmap or perlegen database . interestingly, significant difference  was observed between data obtained from the hapmap database and those from the perlegen database especially for the chinese population probably due to fewer samples being examined in the perlegen database.

nucleotide diversity at mrp1
the extent of variation at mrp <dig> was evaluated using two conventional measures of nucleotide diversity: Ï€, the average heterozygosity per site and Î¸, the population mutation parameter <cit> . tajima's d statistic was also calculated to assess deviation from the neutral mutation model <cit> . a positive tajima's d value for a single gene is indicative of positive heterozygote advantage while a negative tajima's d value for an individual gene suggests selection of a specific allele over the alternative allele <cit> . however, when a negative tajima's d value is observed in most of the genes that were examined in a particular population, it is suggestive of a recent expansion in that population <cit> .

with all the exonic regions sequenced, the above nucleotide diversity statistics were determined for non-synonymous versus synonymous snps at mrp <dig> . the Î¸ value for synonymous snps at mrp <dig> was found to be  <dig>  Ã—  <dig>  which was comparable to mean Î¸ values of other reported genes including  <dig> transporter genes  Ã—  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> candidate genes associated with blood pressure homeostasis  Ã—  <dig>  <cit>  but slightly higher than the mean Î¸ values of  <dig> random genes  Ã—  <dig>  <cit> . however, the Î¸ value for non-synonymous snps  at mrp <dig> was much higher than mean Î¸ values of the other reports  Ã—  <dig>  <cit>  probably due to the small size of the mrp <dig> exons in which the non-synonymous snps reside. interestingly, while the Ï€ of synonymous snps  at mrp <dig> was comparable to the reported mean Ï€s values in other genes  Ã—  <dig>  <cit> , the Ï€ns at mrp <dig>  was much lower than the mean reported Ï€ns values for the other genes  Ã—  <dig>  <cit> . this low Ï€ns at mrp <dig> was also reported previously  <cit>  with the reported Ï€ns value  being much lower than the present observation . notably, the Ï€ns/Ï€s at mrp <dig> was less than  <dig> , suggesting that this gene is likely to be under selective pressure. importantly, the Î¸ values for both synonymous and non-synonymous snps were greater than the corresponding Ï€ values, resulting in negative tajima's d statistic which suggests that the coding region of mrp <dig> may have undergone negative selection or population expansion. it is more likely that mrp <dig> gene have undergone negative selection since the average total nucleotide diversity in the mrp <dig> gene   was found to be greater than the amino acid diversity    <cit> .

snps e10/1299g>t and e16/ <dig> g>t are potentially deleterious
as nucleotide diversity statistics suggest that the coding region of mrp <dig> may be under negative selection, we thus further analyzed the exonic snps at mrp <dig> to evaluate if any of these snps may have deleterious effects on mrp <dig> structure/function.

exonic snps, particularly non-synonymous snps, have the potential to alter the secondary/tertiary structure of proteins and/or affect the protein function. a total of  <dig> exonic snps were identified at this gene locus of which five have not been previously reported . most of the exonic snps occurred at low frequencies  in only one or two populations. while at least 30% of the synonymous snps at mrp <dig> occurred at greater than 5% frequency in all the four populations examined, all of the non-synonymous snps occurred at less than 3% in only one or at most two populations . this observation highlights the conservation of exonic polymorphisms at mrp <dig> and suggests that altering the non-synonymous snps may have a deleterious effect and are likely to be selected against, resulting in their low frequencies.

to assess if any of the non-synonymous snps at mrp <dig> have potentially damaging effect on the protein structure/function, the location of these six snps were displayed on the mrp <dig> protein topological image using the sosui and topo <dig> programs. as evident in figure 2b, none of the non-synonymous snps reside in the transmembrane regions although four of these snps reside near or within the nucleotide binding domain  of the mrp <dig> protein. nonetheless, snpe <dig>  and snpe <dig>  reside near the transmembrane region, while snpe <dig>  reside on a conserved glycine residue near the conserved walker a consensus motif of the nbd  <cit> , suggesting that these snps may have functional significance. snp e2/ <dig> c>t was only found at less than 3% in the chinese and malay populations while snp e10/ <dig> g>t occurred at less than 2% in the caucasian population only and snp e16/ <dig> g>t occurred at less than 3% in the indian and caucasian populations . the snp frequencies of snp e10/ <dig> g>t and snp e16/ <dig> g>t in the caucasian population were comparable to a previous report  <cit> .

three different algorithms, sift <cit> , polymorphism phenotyping   <cit> and panther  <cit> were then utilized to predict the functional significance of the six non-synonymous snps. sift predicts the effect of amino acid substitutions based on the assumption that the important amino acid will be conserved in the protein family <cit> . polyphen predicts the effect of the amino acid variant on the function or structure of the protein based on current knowledge of protein structure, interactions and evolution <cit>  while the panther program predicts the effect of an amino acid substitution on the protein's function using amino acid substitution scores derived from an alignment of related protein sequences and statistics from hidden markov models <cit> .

interestingly, snp e10/ <dig> g>t, which is located near the transmembrane domain, was predicted to be potentially deleterious by the panther but not the sift or polyphen algorithms. this snp was reported to affect the ability of mrp <dig> to confer drug resistance as well as to transport organic anions  <cit>  suggesting that the panther program may be more accurate in predicting the functional impact of polymorphisms than sift or polyphen. this observation is similar to a previous report that utilizes both bioinformatics and biochemical approaches to compare the accuracy of the polyphen and panther programs in predicting functionally deleterious polymorphisms in the abca <dig> gene  <cit> . they found that the panther software is significantly  more accurate in its prediction of the functional consequence of nonsynonymous snps. they also reported that the panther program is capable of correctly predicting the functional impact of greater than 94% of the polymorphisms examined while polyphen is only ~88% accurate in predicting the functional impact of polymorphisms  <cit> .

significantly, all of the three different algorithms predicted that snp e16/ <dig> g>t, which resides close to walker a and results in g671v substitution, was likely to have a potentially deleterious effect on protein function . the significance of this polymorphism has also been demonstrated previously by conrad et al.  <cit>  who reported that the mrna expression of peripheral lymphocytes from individuals carrying the snp e16/ <dig> g>t polymorphism was lower than the average expression level. the lower expression of the mrp <dig> g671v transcript is suggestive of greater accumulation of mrp <dig> drugs in the cells which may lead to adverse drug reactions. curiously, that report also found that the g671v polymorphism did not affect the transport of mrp <dig> substrates including leukotriene c <dig>  17Î²-estradiol 17Î²--glucuronide and estrone sulfate by membrane vesicles prepared from transiently transfected heksv293t cells  <cit> . recently, the same group also reported similar mrp <dig> protein expression levels and transport properties in human embryonic kidney cells were transfected with mrp <dig> constructs carrying either glycine or valine at amino acid position  <dig>  <cit> . the observation that the g671v polymorphism did not affect mrp <dig> protein expression or transport ability of some mrp <dig> substrates in vitro  <cit>  does not rule out the possibility of functional significance of this polymorphism in vivo especially since the same group reported decreased transcript expression in individuals carrying this polymorphism. it is still possible that this polymorphism affect the transport of other mrp <dig> substrates that has not been examined. it is also possible that although the snp e16/ <dig> g>t polymorphism does not affect mrp <dig> transport ability, it may affect other yet-to-be-examined functional properties of the protein . it has been reported that an artificial mutation e1089q created in mrp <dig> markedly affected the ability of mrp <dig> protein to confer resistance without affecting its ability to transport organic anions  <cit> . hence, the snp e16/ <dig> g>t polymorphism warrants further investigation.

hence, the bioinformatics approach may be useful in facilitating the prediction of potentially functionally significant polymorphism so that future research may be directed to characterizing these polymorphisms.

functional implications of polymorphisms at mrp1
the current detailed characterization of polymorphisms at mrp <dig> in four different ethnic populations highlights several characteristics about this gene that may facilitate more rational approaches to studies associating this gene with functional changes. we have previously reported that the diverse haplotypes and weak ld across mrp <dig>  <cit> could perhaps provide an explanation for the failure of previous studies to detect association between polymorphisms in this gene and functional differences  <cit>  and highlight the importance of fully characterizing the ld and haplotype profiles of the gene before embarking on association studies. its ld and haplotype architecture suggest that it may be necessary to identify alternative approaches for association studies of this gene as it may not be feasible to utilize tag snps. a possible approach is to identify polymorphisms with potential functional significance before performing association studies, possibly by identifying those polymorphisms that may have been subjected to selection pressures.

we recently identified a high frequency snp at the 5' flanking promoter region of mrp <dig> that demonstrated evidence of recent positive selection and affected the promoter activity of mrp <dig> <cit> . in this report, through the sequencing of the mrp <dig> exonic and flanking regions, we identified a gcc-trinucleotide multi-allelic str polymorphism residing within the 5'utr/promoter region of mrp <dig> that was found at relatively high frequencies in all populations examined. notably, the frequency distribution of the different number of str alleles in the different population was found to be different . although it was previously reported that the 5'utr/promoter region contains the gcc-triplet repeats that is absent in the rodent sequence and  <dig>   <dig> and/or  <dig> of these repeats were observed in different cell lines and pbmc from a single individual  <cit> , no reports have yet examined the variation of this polymorphism in the different ethnic populations. this str is approximately  <dig> bp from the snp that we previously reported to show evidence of recent positive selection <cit> . given that the selection is recent it may be expected that it would be in strong ld with the positively selected snp. since strs within/near promoters have been implicated to affect promoter activity and expression levels of the gene, it would be worthwhile to further examine the effect that this polymorphism together with the positively selected snp have in influencing promoter activity and hence expression of mrp <dig> 

interestingly, while the promoter region of mrp <dig> may be under recent positive selective pressure <cit> , in this study we also found that the coding region of this gene may have undergone negative selection pressure as suggested by nucleotide diversity indices. two coding snps e16/ <dig> g>t and e10/ <dig> g>t have been predicted by either the panther program or all three programs  to have a deleterious effect on the structure/function of the protein. the significance of these snps for general association studies may be limited since these snp occurs at very low frequencies  in only one or two of the four populations examined. nonetheless, this snp may be associated with rare events including adr.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, based on the "common disease-common variant" hypothesis, the previously reported common polymorphism within the promoter of mrp <dig> that showed evidence of recent positive selection  <cit> would be useful for association studies of common diseases/drug response. nonetheless, the rare exonic snp in this gene that we demonstrate here to be likely to be under negative selection pressure may be useful for studies associating this gene with rare phenotypes including adr, which has been listed as the top five leading causes of death in western countries  <cit> .
