BACKGROUND
scutellarin  is the major active component extracted from erigeron breviscapus. it is a chinese herbal compound endowed with antioxidant and anti-inflammation properties . in the brain, scutellarin has been shown to decrease microglia inflammatory response  <cit> . in addition to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, scutellarin has been demonstrated to have anti-apoptotic properties in animal models of ischemic stroke  <cit> . we reported recently that scutellarin effectively suppressed production of proinflammatory mediators in activated microglia in experimentally induced cerebral ischemia following middle cerebral artery occlusion  in the adult rats and in bv- <dig> microglia in vitro  <cit> . it was shown that scutellarin decreased the production of proinflammatory cytokines including tnf-α and il-1β and reactive oxygen species  by activated microglia whose robust reaction featured prominently in the acute phase of cerebral ischemia. all this has pointed to the therapeutic potential of scutellarin and its clinical use for amelioration of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation.

while activated microglia evidently preponderated in the ischemic cerebral tissue in the early phase of mcao  <cit> , massive astrocytes soon accumulated the infarcted areas. indeed cerebral ischemia leads to widespread progressive alterations in astrocytes, including cell hypertrophy, upregulation of intermediate filaments and increase in cell proliferation, commonly referred to as reactive astrogliosis . the close spatial relation between activated microglia and reactive astrocytes in the ischemic area invites speculation that both glial cells might work in concert through cellular interaction or communication in the ensuing healing process. the functional relationship between activated microglia and reactive astrocytes, however, has remained to be fully explored. in consideration of scutellarin as a potential therapeutic agent, it is therefore desirable to determine if it would also act on astrocytes as for activated microglia, and if so, the mode of its action on astrocytes.

this study was therefore aimed to determine whether scutellarin would exert its effects on astrocytes that are closely associated with activated microglia. in the latter, we have reported that expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and notch- <dig> pathway and its members was significantly suppressed by scutellarin. it is relevant therefore to ascertain if these biomarkers strongly expressed in reactive astrocytes would also be affected. secondly, if indeed scutellarin were able to affect or regulate the astrocyte reaction, a compelling question would be whether it would directly act on astrocytes, or indirectly such as via activated microglia. in the latter, the notion took into consideration of the reactive response of microglia and astrocytes in temporal sequence  <cit>  in cerebral ischemia, in which acute microglial activation appears to precede that of astrocyte reaction; furthermore, both glial cells are spatially related. we report here that scutellarin could enhance the expression of gfap, nestin, notch- <dig> signaling and its members in tnc <dig> astrocytes as well as in reactive astrocytes in mcao rats. more strikingly, scutellarin was found to amplify the expression of above-named biomarkers along with proinflammatory mediators, a process that is mediated by activated microglia as demonstrated in vitro.

RESULTS
tnc <dig> viability assay with scutellarin
tnc <dig> astrocyte cell line instead of primary cultured astrocytes was used for this study to ensure that we obtained enough cells for adequate amounts of protein for western blot analysis. the cytotoxicity data was obtained by the mts assay for the effect of scutellarin on tnc <dig> cells. scutellarin  did not result in any significant cell death . in this study, we have used scutellarin at  <dig>  mm for all subsequent analysis. this dosage was used for treatment of bv- <dig> cells also in our previous studies in which dose dependent assay had earlier been done  <cit> .fig.  <dig> cell viability assay of tnc <dig> astrocytes : scutellarin  incubated for different duration did not result in any significant cell death. treatment of tnc <dig> with scutellarin : scutellarin at  <dig>  mm did not elicit a noticeable reaction in tnc <dig> whose gfap/tnf-α  expression remained comparable to cells in the control in basic medium  . bm + s, basic medium + scutellarin. microglia mediate tnc <dig> astrocyte reaction : tnf-α mrna expression in tnc <dig> astrocytes remained relatively unchanged at all time-points following treatment with bm, bm + l and bv- <dig> conditioned medium . however, in tnc <dig> incubated cm + l for various time points, tnc <dig> showed a remarkable increase in tnf-α peaking at 24 h. confocal images in d showing gfap , and tnf-α  expression in tnc <dig> astrocytes incubated with different medium for 24 h. compared with cells incubated in bm and bm + lps , tnc <dig> astrocytes incubated with lps-stimulated bv- <dig> cell conditioned medium   are hypertrophic and exhibit a marked increase in gfap and tnf-α immunofluorescence. scale bars 20 μm



scutellarin does not exert a direct effect on tnc1
to determine if scutellarin would exert a direct effect on tnc <dig>  it was added directly into the medium with tnc <dig>  by phase contrast microscopy, the external morphology of tnc <dig> astrocytes incubated in the basic medium +  <dig>  mm scutellarin  appeared comparable to that in the control cells in the basic medium . furthermore, tnf-α  and inos  immunofluorescence in bm + s remained relatively unaltered as compared with the control cells incubated in bm. this indicates that scutellarin does not stimulate tnc <dig> directly.

lipopolysaccharide  does not exert a direct effect on tnc1
by rt-pcr, tnf-α  and inos  mrna expression levels in tnc <dig> astrocytes incubated in the basic medium , bm + lps  and bv- <dig> conditioned medium  were negligible. remarkably, the mrna expression levels were drastically increased by several hundred folds when treated with lps-stimulated bv- <dig> conditioned medium  . this shows that tnc <dig> activation was only mildly elicited and directly by lps; instead, its vigorous activation is mediated by activated microglia. tnf-α, il-1β and inos were used as markers for reactive astrocytes along with gfap because these proinflammatory mediators have been reported to be highly expressed in activated astrocytes  <cit> .

tnc <dig> activation is mediated by activated microglia
microglia-mediated activation of tnc <dig> astrocytes was further evidenced by the drastic increase in gfap , tnf-α  and inos  immunofluorescence in cells incubated in cm + l compared with cells incubated in bm and bm + l groups. furthermore, tnc <dig> cells treated with cm + l appeared evidently hypertrophic .

gfap was moderately expressed in tnc <dig> incubated in cm ; it was enhanced in tnc <dig> treated with cm + l . notch- <dig>  nicd, hes and nestin expression was hardly detected in cm group , but was enhanced in cm + l . remarkably, upon pretreatment with scutellarin in cm + sl for 24 h, expression of all markers was drastically increased being more pronounced for nicd  and nestin .fig.  <dig> scutellarin enhanced gfap , notch- <dig> , nicd , hes- <dig> , nestin  and tnf-α  expression in tnc <dig> via bv-2-conditioned medium. moderate gfap expression was detected in tnc <dig> incubated in cm; also, notch- <dig>  nicd, hes- <dig>  nestin and tnf-α  was weakly expressed. the expression however was enhanced in cm + l . upon treatment with cm + sl for 24 h, expression of all markers was drastically increased being more pronounced for nicd  and nestin . note tnc <dig> astrocytes project long cytoplasmic processes with expansions . scale bars 20 μm

electron microscopy
by scanning electronic microscopy, most tnc <dig> astrocytes in cm group were oblong; on closer examination, the surface projected some filamentous processes . in cm + l group, the cells became hypertrophic bearing long extending processes  when compared with cells in the cm group; the processes in some cells were expanded . most of the cells in cm + sl group were grossly hypertrophic ; large numbers of filamentous processes projected from the cell surface and appeared to intertwine with those emanated from the adjacent cells . most strikingly, tnc <dig> astrocytes in cm + sl spread out extensively and thinly giving them a “squamous” appearance. in transmission electron microscopy, tnc <dig> astrocytes in all three groups showed a round nucleus bearing one to three conspicuous nucleoli . the copious cytoplasm in cm + sl group as compared with the other two groups was filled with polyribosomes and the usual cell organelles . compared with other groups, cells in cm + sl had a larger cell profile. many long filamentous processes projected from the cell surface as observed by scanning electron microscopy.fig.  <dig> scanning electron microscopy of tnc <dig> astrocytes in cm , cm + sl  and cm + sl  groups. note the drastic transformation of tnc <dig> from oblong outline  to “squamous” appearance in the cm + sl  whose cell surface exhibit a large number of filamentous processes . by transmission electron microscopy , tnc <dig> astrocytes in cm + sl are evidently enlarged  as compared with cm  and cm + l  groups; moreover, the cells contain a larger amount of cytoplasm rich in polyribosomes and usual organelles



morphological evidence of interaction between activated microglia and reactive astrocytes
in rats subjected to mcao, a large infarcted area was observed in the ipsilateral cerebrum at early time-points. by immunofluorescence labeling, the epicenter of the infarcted area at  <dig> and 7 days after mcao was occupied by massive activated microglia labeled by lectin . on closer examination, the lectin labeled activated microglia were mostly round with some cells emitted short cytoplasmic processes . at the border area with the non-lesion cortex or adjacent to it , activated microglia were admixed with gfap positive astrocytes that appeared hypertrophic with long projecting and broad processes ; in some areas, both glial cell types were closely associated or intermingled. in non-lesion area, microglia and astrocytes appeared relatively normal both bearing fine processes; furthermore, their close spatial relation as observed in the lesion zone was not evident .fig.  <dig> morphological evidence of interaction between activated microglia and reactive astrocytes. figure showing ipsilateral ischemic cerebral cortex at 3 days after mcao. the dotted line in a delineates approximately the border of the infarct epicenter which shows massive accumulation of activated microglia intermingled with reactive astrocytes. b <dig>  b <dig> show lectin-labeled activated microglia . they are obviously hypertrophic and are mostly rounded  or emit short stout processes . gfap labeled reactive astrocytes  are also hypertrophic, and extend their long processes between the activated microglia; in some areas, they are closely associated . astrocytic processes also surround the blood vessel  in b <dig>  b <dig>  the close spatial relation between the activated microglia and reactive astrocytes is not evident away from the border . b1– <dig> are enlarged view of area 1– <dig> in a. scale bar in a: 100 μm; scale bar in b: 50 μm. dapi, blue




scutellarin enhanced astrocyte reaction in ischemic cortex
by immunofluorescence microscopy, robust astrocyte reaction was observed in the penumbral region in ischemic cerebral cortex, notably at  <dig> and 14 days after mcao. mcao induced astrocyte reaction was evidenced by the enhanced gfap labeling coupled with increased expression of notch- <dig>  and its members, nicd  and hes- <dig> . a striking feature after mcao was the induced expression of nestin in gfap positive astrocytes . expression of tnf-α , il-1β  and inos  was concomitantly augmented.fig.  <dig> scutellarin enhanced notch-1expression in astrocytes after mcao. notch- <dig> expression is negligible in astrocytes in the sham . its expression  was moderately induced by mcao in gfap positive astrocytes  at  <dig>  and 14 days . however, notch- <dig> expression was markedly increased in hypertrophic astrocytes in scutellarin treated mcao rats  in comparison with the matching controls . scale bars: 50 µm. dapi-blue

fig.  <dig> scutellarin enhanced tnf-α expression in astrocytes after mcao. tnf-α expression  was absent in astrocytes in the sham . it was induced in gfap positive astrocytes  at  <dig> and 7 days  after mcao, but the expression subsided at 14 days . in mcao rats treated with scutellarin . tnf-á expression in astrocytes was markedly enhanced being most pronounced at 7 days when compared with the matching mcao control groups . scale bars: 50 µm. dapi-blue




in mcao rats given scutellarin injections, astrocytic reaction as manifested by the immunofluorescence of the above-mentioned markers was further enhanced. astrocytes were grossly hypertrophic in comparison with the matching mcao control rats without scutellarin or sham group. scutellarin further elevated the mcao-induced expression of notch- <dig> , nicd , hes- <dig>  and nestin . in parallel to this, expression tnf-α , il-1β  and inos  immunofluorescence in the reactive astrocytes also became more pronounced. the enhanced increase for the above biomarkers by scutellarin was progressive when compared with counterpart cells in the mcao and sham group being most pronounced at 7 days and was sustained till 14 days; thereafter, the expression appeared to diminish but remained to be more intense when compared with cells at the corresponding time-points at 21 days .

scutellarin not only accentuated the immunofluorescence of the various markers in reactive astrocytes, but also induced the changes of their phenotype. thus, in mcao rats given scutellarin treatment, the cells were evidently enlarged bearing dilated processes notably at  <dig> and 14 days . gfap labeled hypertrophic astrocytes often extended their long processes between activated microglia or encircled the outer walls of the blood vessels .

discussion
direct effects of scutellarin on microglia and astrocytes
we reported recently that scutellarin could suppress nfkb and notch signaling in activated microglia in their production of proinflammatory mediators in mcao rats as well as in bv- <dig> cells  <cit> .this was sequel to our earlier demonstration that notch- <dig> expression in activated microglia could transactivate nfkb that is linked to production of proinflammatory mediators . in light of this, it was therefore concluded that scutellarin is a potential therapeutic agent that can attenuate microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in ischemic/hypoxic brain injury. it is well documented that associated with the microglia activation in ischemic injury, astrogliosis also featured prominently  <cit> . indeed, following diverse brain injuries, astrocytes are activated and described as reactive astrocytes . reactive astrocytes are known to undergo proliferation and are involved in different functions such as scar formation and tissue repair among others  <cit> . scutellarin could reduce the infarct area in rats with mcao  <cit>  indicating that it can promote tissue repair in ischemic injury and, hence, exert its effects on reactive astrocytes which play a pivotal role in this process. the purpose of this study was to ascertain if scutellarin would act on astrocytes, and if so, to determine its mode of action. for this, we first investigated the effect of scutellarin on tnc <dig> astrocytes in vitro. as opposed to bv- <dig> cells, direct application of scutellarin to tnc <dig> did not elicit an obvious increase in gfap expression, a specific marker for astrocytes; moreover, neither tnf-α nor inos expression was noticeably altered. it stands to reason therefore that scutellarin does not act directly, if at all, on astrocytes. it was then surmised that scutellarin might act through intermediary cells. a putative candidate for this would be the microglia whose activation in the ischemic injury is acute in onset  <cit>  and invariably precedes that of astrocytes; furthermore, activated microglia and reactive astrocytes at the injury site are in close proximity as is evident in the present mcao model suggesting the possibility of their functional interaction.

microglia mediate astrocyte reaction
in consideration of a possible interaction between activated microglia and astrocytes, tnc <dig> astrocytes were first exposed to basic medium , or basic medium + lps . interestingly, gfap, tnf-α and inos expression between the two tnc <dig> groups was moderate and comparable. this suggests that direct lps treatment did not evoke a noticeable response in tnc <dig> astrocytes. against this however was the report that lps could activate the primary astrocytes bearing tlr <dig>  <cit> . the discrepancy in results may be attributed to different cell models used. remarkably, when tnc <dig> astrocytes were exposed to conditioned medium derived from lps-stimulated bv- <dig> cells , a vigorous response was observed as manifested by the marked increased in gfap, tnf-α and inos expression. as a corollary, it is suggested that the drastic tnc <dig> astrocyte reaction is mediated by activated microglia.

scutellarin amplifies microglia-mediated astrocyte reaction
the present results have shown that scutellarin is capable of amplifying the astrocyte reaction. this notion lends its support from the fact that gfap, notch- <dig>  nicd, hes- <dig>  nestin expression along with that of tnf-α, il-1β and inos was noticeably increased in tnc <dig> astrocytes exposed to cm + sl, when compared with cells incubated in cm + l. by western blot, the increase was in the range of 10–30 % of the expression levels across the various proteins. a similar increase in expression occurred in reactive astrocytes in mcao rats given scutellarin treatment. in this, the reactive astrocytes exhibited more intense immunofluorescence of the above markers compared with mcao rats not treated with the drug. microglia-mediated astrocyte reaction is also evident by an apparent hypertrophy of astrocytes bearing long filamentous processes and expansion of cells as revealed by electron microscopy. the functional significance for the phenotypic change is uncertain but it may promote communication between reactive astrocytes via the intertwined filamentous in tissue repair. in mcao, the long extending processes of reactive astrocytes were observed to intercalate between activated microglia. the close spatial relation between activated microglia and reactive astrocytes in the complex environment in ischemic tissue may facilitate a paracrine function. indeed, it was reported that activated microglia through production of mcsf could stimulate astrocytes in their production of proinflammatory cytokines  <cit>  suggesting the functional relation or communication between two glial cell types. furthermore, it has been reported that the communication pathways among microglia, astrocytes and neurons are responsible for neuroprotection  <cit> . such communication may be mediated by microglia atp via p2y <dig> receptor on astrocyte which resulted in production of il- <dig> that provides neuroprotection. crosstalk between macrophages and astrocytes affecting the proliferation, reactive phenotype and inflammatory response, suggesting a role during reactive gliosis following spinal cord injury has recently been reported  <cit> .

scutellarin enhances gfap, notch- <dig> pathway and nestin expression in reactive astrocytes
contrary to its suppression of microglia activation in mcao model and bv- <dig> cells, we show here that scutellarin instead promotes the astrocyte reaction as shown by the enhanced expression of notch- <dig>  nicd and hes- <dig>  additionally, scutellarin expanded the expression of nestin in virtually every reactive astrocyte both in vitro and in vivo. reactive astrogliosis is reported to be involved in tissue repair or scar formation. it is conceivable that increase in hypertrophic astrocytic processes with enhanced gfap which constitutes the cytoskeleton or intermediate filaments would facilitate such a function. furthermore, vascular profiles of varying sizes in the penumbral region appeared to be fully invested by astrocytic end-feet suggesting that the integrity of the blood–brain barrier which would have been compromised in ischemia is being restored.

nestin is a marker of neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells, and its expression is observed in a subpopulation of reactive astrocytes  <cit> . it is a class vi intermediate filament protein that was first described as a neural stem/progenitor cell marker  <cit> . neuroepithelial stem cells can differentiate into neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes, and nestin has been shown to be down-regulated or to completely disappear during such differentiation. here we showed that nestin which was hardly detected in tnc <dig> was induced in some cells in cm + l conditioned medium. in cm + sl treated cells, nestin expression was detected and markedly enhanced in all cells. virtually all gfap labeled reactive astrocytes in scutellarin injected mcao rats emitted intense nestin immunofluorescence compared with the matching control at the corresponding time-points. the expression of nestin in reactive astrocytes suggests that some of them had “de-differentiated” and assumed a “stemness” property, but it remains to be determined if they might differentiate  <cit> . while reactive astrocytes appear to have greater plasticity than was previously realized  <cit> , and may provide a source of multipotent cells or functional neurons for regenerative medicine, the signaling pathway that govern the formation of injury-induced nestin positive reactive astrocytes having the potential of neural stem cells remains uncertain. thus, the demonstration of notch- <dig> signaling and its members both in vivo and in vitro in this study may provide a clue for the regulatory mechanism of nestin expression in reactive astrocytes. it is relevant therefore to note that proliferating reactive astrocytes are regulated by notch- <dig> in the peri-infarct area after stroke  <cit> . it has been reported that treatment of mcao mice with dapt, an inhibitor of γ secretase, decreases the number of olig2+ and nestin+ reactive astrocytes  <cit>  alluding to the possibility that notch- <dig> signaling in reactive astrocytes regulates nestin expression. the colocalization and concurrent upregulation of notch- <dig> signaling and nestin in reactive astrocytes in the present results suggest that both may operate in synergy; but in the lack of experimental evidence, this remains purely speculative. other pathways or molecules such as mirnas known to regulate astrogliosis , and that might be involved in microglia-mediated astrocyte reaction and modulated by scutellarin should be future scope of study.

scutellarin promotes tnf-α, il-1β and inos in reactive astrocytes
while scutellarin decreases the expression of proinflammatory mediators including tnf-α, il-1β, inos and no production in activated microglia, it conversely upregulates their expression in reactive astrocytes. it is well documented that excess production of proinflammatory mediators from activated microglia is detrimental to neurons  <cit> ; on the other hand, their increased production in reactive astrocytes by scutellarin remains speculative. there is increasing agreement that tnf-α in vitro and in vivo may protect neurons against excitotoxic, oxidative and ischemic injuries. it may be hypothesized that tnf-α is not potent to kill neurons by itself, but it may function synergistically with other cytokines and toxic agents such as no, free radicals or glutamate  <cit> . likewise, il-1β can promote survival of retinal ganglion cells  <cit>  and neurons  <cit> . furthermore, it has been reported that nitric oxide could induce the expression of gfap in reactive astrocytes which exhibit inos expression  <cit> . it has been reported that inos-derived no can act as an endogenous antioxidant in traumatic brain injury suggesting the neuroprotective role of inos  <cit> . taken together, it is suggested that the increased expression of tnf-α, il-1β and inos by scutellarin might not necessary be neurotoxic, but can be neuroprotective. it may also be argued that the final result/amount of scutellarin-regulated pro-inflammatory mediators would determine whether they are neurotoxic or neuroprotective but this remains debatable. from a speculative point of view, tnf-α, il-1β and inos derived from reactive astrocytes might be beneficial instead of cytotoxic as those from activated microglia.

CONCLUSIONS
scutellarin can regulate the expression of gfap, notch- <dig> signaling, and nestin along with that of proinflammatory mediators in reactive astrocytes in ischemic injury. in vitro results showed that scutellarin did not exert a direct effect on astrocytes; rather, it acted through the intermediary activated microglia. scutellarin acts primarily to amplify the microglia-mediated astrocyte reaction thus highlighting a functional “cross-talk” between activated microglia and reactive astrocytes. on the other hand, the specific molecules such as cytokines involved in this are uncertain. notwithstanding, it is concluded that scutellarin is a potent agent that can facilitate the communication between activated microglia and reactive astrocytes in ischemic injury, an inter-glial cell mechanism that may be crucial to issue repair.
