BACKGROUND
dopamine, an important neurotransmitter in the brain, plays a major role in the control of motor functions and behavioral patterns via interacting with specific cell surface receptors. dopamine receptors belong to the large family of g protein-coupled receptors and can be classified as d1-like  and d2-like  subgroups based on their sequence homology and pharmacological characteristics  <cit> . the human dopamine d <dig> receptor  gene was originally cloned by van tol et al.  <cit> . the 5' flanking region of the gene was characterized by kamakura et al.  <cit>  as a housekeeping gene-like promoter. the promoter lacks a tata or caat box but several putative transcription factor binding sites and cpg islands have been identified. 5'-race analysis of drd <dig> mrna revealed multiple transcription initiation sites located between nucleotides - <dig> and - <dig>  relative to the translational start site. the region between - <dig> and - <dig> was found to contain the minimal promoter and to confer tissue-specific expression on the drd <dig> gene and a putative repressor element was identified between nucleotides - <dig> and - <dig>  although high drd <dig> mrna expression was detected in the limbic area and frontal cortex associated with emotional function, motivation and cognition, the highest mrna level was found in the retina  <cit> . the drd <dig> plays an important role in cognitive functions and it is a target of numerous antipsychotic drugs widely used in psychiatric disorders  <cit> .

the 5' regulatory region and coding sequence of the drd <dig> gene harbour a number of polymorphisms which may arise due to its telomeric location on chromosome  <dig>  promoter polymorphisms of the drd <dig> gene, including the  <dig> base pair  duplication and several snps , have been extensively studied as possible risk factors of psychological traits as well as behavioural and psychiatric disorders. despite the numerous polymorphic allele variants, only one mutation has been described in this region  <cit> . a  <dig> bp deleted sequence was identified only in heterozygotes and with an extremely low allele frequency. to assess the potential functional role of the  <dig> bp deletion, an in silico analysis was performed that revealed various transcription factor binding sites within this short region.

an association between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  and the long form of the  <dig> bp duplication polymorphism was confirmed by a number of groups  <cit> , although contradictory results have been reported by others  <cit> . interestingly, the short form of this promoter length polymorphism has been associated with novelty seeking, a human personality trait sharing common characteristics with adhd  <cit> . seaman et al.  <cit>  identified several consensus transcription factor binding sites within the  <dig> bp repeat, and there is in vitro evidence for enhanced sp <dig> binding capacity of the duplicated form  <cit> . the functional role of these genetic variants was studied recently employing in vitro luciferase reporter assays, demonstrating a lower transcriptional activity for the duplicated allele compared to the shorter variant  <cit> .

another well studied polymorphism in the drd <dig> regulatory region is the - <dig> c/g snp, which is thought to interact with the recently described - <dig> a/g variant in the adjacent position  <cit> . it has been suggested that the - <dig> c/g snp results in the creation of an ap- <dig> transcription factor binding site  <cit> . an association of the - <dig> c/g snp with adhd  <cit> , schizophrenia  <cit>  and personality traits  <cit>  have been reported in the literature but have not been confirmed by others. although there are no association studies concerning the -1217g insertion/deletion polymorphism, its putative functional effect was examined by fmri and a correlation was found between the insertion allelic variant and a greater activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, a brain area mediating conflict  <cit> .

one of the most studied polymorphisms of the drd <dig> promoter region is the - <dig> c/t snp. an association between novelty seeking and the - <dig> cc genotype was first identified in a japanese population  <cit> , followed by a replication in a caucasian  population  <cit> , although negative results have also been reported  <cit> . a recent meta-analysis showed a weak but positive association between this polymorphism and novelty seeking  <cit> . lakatos et al.  <cit>  revealed an association between the infant disorganized attachment and the t allele of the - <dig> c/t snp but only in combination with the 7-repeat form of the drd <dig> exon iii polymorphism. a family-based association approach demonstrating a low-rate transmission of the drd <dig> 7-repeat – - <dig> t haplotype in a large secure group of infants  <cit>  supports this finding, although results to the contrary have also been published  <cit> . furthermore, a positive association was detected between the - <dig> c allele and schizophrenia  <cit> , a disorder with elevated drd <dig> mrna levels in the frontal cortex  <cit> , although others failed to replicate this result  <cit> . a weak relationship between the - <dig> c/t snp and adhd has also been reported  <cit> . to date, only one study has been performed that reveals the functional effect of the - <dig> c/t snp  <cit> , using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter assay with the minimal promoter previously defined in the y <dig> retinoblastoma cell line. the results from these experiments showed that the t allele reduced promoter activity by 40% relative to the c allele.

in the present study, we attempted to replicate the possible transcriptional effect of the - <dig> c/t snp using a similar in vitro reporter system in a number of neuroblastoma and retinoblastoma cell lines.

RESULTS
drd <dig> gene expression in neural and non-neural cell lines
previous studies suggested a wide range of putative regulator elements in the drd <dig> promoter region that might be involved in gene expression. to better characterize the promoter, we performed luciferase assays in two neuroblastoma  and one retinoblastoma  cell line. a non-neural cell line  was also included for comparison purposes. prior to transcriptional analysis, the cell lines were analysed for endogenous drd <dig> gene expression. figure  <dig> shows the endogenous drd <dig> mrna levels in the four cell lines as detected by rt-pcr. significant expression of the drd <dig> gene was demonstrated in sk-n-f <dig> and imr <dig> neuroblastoma cells, as well as in y <dig> retinoblastoma cell line . a low but measurable band was also detected in hela cells, reflecting some drd <dig> expression in this non-neural cell line previously observed by others  <cit> . there is an apparent difference in the mobility of the drd <dig> transcripts in the hela and neural cell lines, likely resulting from the higher concentration of drd <dig> transcripts in the neural cell lines. in other experiments in which much lower quantities of pcr product were loaded onto gels, no mobility shift was observed and only a very faint band was detected in case of hela .

drd <dig> promoter deletional analysis in transiently transfected neural and non-neural cell lines
to verify whether the region upstream of the transcription start site has a repressor element between - <dig> and - <dig> – as previously suggested by kamakura et al.  <cit> , a panel of six 5' deletion mutants were created and cloned into the pgl <dig> promoterless vector, upstream of the luciferase reporter gene . fragment a contained an  <dig> bp sequence of the promoter region , including the  <dig> bp duplication polymorphism. fragment b  retained the putative negative modulator element, while fragment c  lacked this element. fragments d, e and f had the same 5' sequence as a, b and c, respectively, but included an extra 5' end region down to position - <dig>  fragments d, e and f were similar to those used in the japanese study  <cit>  with respect to the 5' utr content. in all experiments, the promoterless pgl3-basic vector served as a negative control and ptk-luc, a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter-containing vector, was used as a positive control.

the six constructs used here exhibited similar expression patterns in each cell line . surprisingly, the series of pdrd4-d, e and f constructs exhibited no significant transcriptional activity, while the pdrd4-a, b and c vectors showed elevated levels in relation to the promoterless vector  . based on the data shown in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  there was no significant difference between the pdrd4-b and c vectors, which differed from one another only by the presence  or absence  of the putative repressor region. on the other hand, a significantly reduced promoter activity of pdrd4-a could be observed in each cell line when compared to construct b  . this suggests that the negative modulator sequence is located between positions - <dig> and - <dig> as opposed to sequences - <dig> and - <dig>  as proposed earlier  <cit> . despite the moderate transcriptional activities of constructs pdrd4-d, e and f, their expression pattern was very similar to that of pdrd4-a, b and c respectively as measured in sk-n-f <dig> and y <dig> cell lines. namely, the constructs containing the putative repressor element located between positions - <dig> and - <dig>  showed significantly reduced transcriptional activity compared to the vectors lacking this region .

effect of the - <dig> c/t snp on transcriptional activity of drd <dig> gene expression
for comparison of the relative promoter activity of the - <dig> c and - <dig> t alleles, the pdrd4-c construct was chosen as the parent plasmid since it exhibited the strongest transcriptional activity in all cell lines tested. after transient transfection of these dnas into sk-n-f <dig>  y <dig> and imr <dig> cells, a high level of luciferase activity was observed for each snp construct relative to the promoterless pgl <dig> control vector . nevertheless, under the conditions applied in these experiments, we could not detect any significant differences between the transcriptional activities of the pdrd4-c constructs possessing either the - <dig> c or t alleles in any of these cell lines.

discussion
regulation of drd <dig> gene expression is a significant issue, not only due to the well-known importance of this neurotransmitter receptor in brain function, but also because its highly polymorphic promoter has been implicated in a number of psychogenetic association studies. the human y <dig> and imr <dig> neuroblastoma cell lines reportedly express drd <dig> mrna  <cit> . in addition to these cells, another neuroblastoma cell line  was also shown to produce high level of drd <dig> mrna in our study . these results are in agreement with the expression pattern of the drd <dig> mrna described by van tol et al  <cit> . a low but detectable level of drd <dig> mrna was also observed in hela cells, indicating that the drd <dig> promoter was slightly active in this cell line, in agreement with recent results  <cit> , but in contrast to earlier data  <cit> .

to characterize the drd <dig> promoter, kamakura et al.  <cit>  performed cat reporter assays using imr <dig>  y <dig> and hela cell lines, and identified a putative promoter region between nucleotides - <dig> and - <dig> conferring tissue-specific drd <dig> expression. in addition, a short region located  <dig>  kb upstream from the initiation codon that harbours the  <dig> bp duplication, has also been shown to exhibit promoter activity  <cit> . notably, we could not map any region with cell type-specific transcriptional activity in our experimental system, as the in vitro transcriptional activity of the six promoter constructs showed a similar expression pattern in all cell lines, including the non-neural hela cells . it is important to note, however, that a cell type-specific feature is often typical for members of the dopamine receptor family  <cit> , indicating the need for additional studies that explore tissue-specific drd <dig> expression in experimental systems that more closely mimic in vivo conditions.

in terms of transcriptional activity, our constructs could be classified into two main groups: the pdrd4-d, e and f group exhibited about  <dig> fold lower activity than the pdrd4-a, b and c group. in fact, plasmids pdrd4-d, e and f possessed similar or even lower activities than the promoterless pgl3-basic vector . these results were quite surprising since the d, e and f fragments were very similar to those used in a former study  <cit> . a possible explanation for the inactivity of these promoter fragments could be due to the existence of four atg codons residing with in this region  at positions - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  three of these start codons are out of reading frame and could lead to the formation of a frame-shifted  luciferase gene. another possibility is that a strong negative modulator element resides in this region.

the comparative analysis of constructs pdrd4-b  and pdrd4-c  was particularly interesting in light of a silencer region mapped to positions - <dig> and - <dig> by kamakura et al.  <cit> . we observed no significant difference between the transcriptional activities of constructs with  or without  the previously identified silencer region . on the other hand, a significant difference was found between the in vitro transcriptional activity of pdrd4-b  and pdrd4-a , suggesting the presence of a negative modulator in the region between positions - <dig> and - <dig>  thus, the transcriptional activity data generated with constructs a, b and c has revealed yet another silencer region upstream from the one previously described  <cit> . together, these results suggest that the human drd <dig> gene promoter may possess two negative modulator regions, one of which did not function in our system. this hypothesized structure of the gene is reminiscent of that of the rat d2-, the drosophila dmdop1-, as well as the rat d <dig> dopamine receptor gene structure, which all contain two inhibitory elements in their promoter  <cit> . nevertheless, the dopamine receptor promoters also show remarkable heterogeneity in their 5'-untranslated region. for example, the drosophila dmdop <dig> and the rat d <dig> dopamine receptor promoter contain an additional activating region beside the silencing elements  <cit> . similarly, the human d1a and d <dig> dopamine receptor genes also comprise varying numbers of positive and negative modulator elements  <cit> . beside the regulatory elements, the precise boundaries of the drd <dig> promoter remain poorly defined. one study suggested that the promoter region might be within an intronic region  <cit> . this theory was based on previously reported discrepancies in the size of the drd <dig> mrna which was originally reported as  <dig>  kb in the sk-n-mc human neuroblastoma cell line and in the striatum, medulla, frontal cortex and limbic area of the rat and monkey brain  <cit> . by contrast, the drd <dig> mrna was later found to be much shorter , and expressed at higher levels, in the corpus callosum, medulla, subthalamic nucleus, as well as in the mesolimbic system and related regions. furthermore, the drd <dig> mrna was barely detected in the striatum and the cerebral cortex  <cit>  in contrast to the previous findings  <cit> . these observed differences in mrna size suggest that the drd <dig> gene might have alternative transcription start sites, as in the case of the catechol-o-methyltransferase  gene, resulting in the formation of two distinct transcripts with differing 5' ends  <cit> . additionally, todd and o'malley suggested the possibility that a large intron might separate the coding exons of the drd <dig> gene from the untranslated exons  <cit> , as described for the dopamine d <dig>  <cit>  and d <dig>  <cit>  receptors. in conclusion, the 5' untranslated region of the dopamine d <dig> receptor shows a high degree of complexity, emphasizing the need for further characterization to better define the core promoter and transcription initiation site.

another aim of our study was to corroborate the effect of the - <dig> c/t snp on the transcriptional activity previously described by okuyama et al.  <cit>  however, in our system we observed no significant difference between the activities of the - <dig> c and - <dig> t alleles, in either the neuroblastoma or retinoblastoma cell lines . there were several differences in experimental setup between the previous and the present study, such as applying different reporter vectors and some variation in the length of the promoter fragment. the length of the cloned promoter fragments especially might have a significant effect on transcriptional activity  <cit> . an additional possibility for these conflicting results is the highly polymorphic nature of this gene. other identified polymorphisms in the drd <dig> promoter region, such as the snps in positions - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  may also influence promoter activity. for this reason, a novel approach for elucidating the effect of these various polymorphisms on drd <dig> gene expression would be to perform a comparative analysis of the snps in combination in the context of different genetic haplotypes.

CONCLUSIONS
the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the - <dig> c/t snp on drd <dig> promoter activity. our results do not confirm previous data assigning different transcriptional activities to the - <dig> c/t alleles in any of the three neuronal cell lines tested. the transcriptional activity of a series of 5' promoter deletion mutants was determined by luciferase reporter system. this experiments revealed a putative silencer region located between positions - <dig> and - <dig>
