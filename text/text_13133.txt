BACKGROUND
the tropical bont tick, amblyomma variegatum, is a major pest of ruminants in africa  <cit> , causing skin lesions  <cit>  and most importantly by vectoring the obligate intracellular proteobacterium erlichia ruminatium, the causative agent of heartwater or cowdriosis in ruminants  <cit> . although originally from africa, a. variegatum has been established in the west indies and is an important threat to domestic ruminants in the americas  <cit> .

among the adaptations found in ticks for successful blood feeding, their salivary glands  have compounds that counteract host hemostasis and inflammation, including anticlotting, antiplatelet, vasodilatory, antihistaminic, antileukotriene, anticomplement, antichemokine, and immune-modulatory compounds  <cit> . during the past  <dig> years, the peptidic composition of tick saliva has been inferred from transcriptome studies, where hundreds of polypeptides are associated with a salivary function in at least  <dig> broad groups of protein families  <cit> . perhaps because secreted salivary proteins are under attack by host antibodies, their rate of evolution is fast; conceivably, it is for this reason that there are many salivary protein families that are, at the primary sequence level, unique to the organism's genus level. tick salivary compounds are of interest for providing insight into the evolution of blood feeding by arthropods, for their possible use as vaccine targets to suppress ticks or the diseases they transmit, and for presenting a platform of novel pharmacologically active compounds.

eight years ago, a pioneer salivary transcriptome analysis of the metastriate tick a. variegatum was performed following the sequencing of near  <dig>  salivary cdna clones from blood-feeding adult ticks  <cit> . in the same year, transcriptome analysis of amblyomma americanum and dermacentor variabilis  <cit>  as well as of the prostriate tick ixodes scapularis  <cit>  were performed. these three papers represent a landmark in tick biology by providing insights into their salivary composition. in these last  <dig> years, there was progress in the number of sialotranscriptomes  sequenced, including representative species of the soft ticks, as well, as in the depth of their analysis. many unique tick families were thus identified and reviewed  <cit> . we recently had the opportunity to collect a. variegatum from cows in the cattle market of kati, mali, a suburb of the capital city, bamako. we separated the sg homogenate by gel chromatography and performed tryptic digest of protein bands, followed by mass spectroscopy  analysis of these fragments. we re-analyzed data from nene et al.  <cit> , available at dbest http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucest of the national center for biotechnology information , producing an annotated and hyperlinked spreadsheet containing new information related to unique tick proteins unavailable in  <dig>  this database was used in conjunction with proteomic analysis to identify expressed peptides. we also submitted over  <dig> coding  sequences to genbank, making these invaluable data available in their non-redundant  database, which has only five sequences from a. variegatum as of june,  <dig>  nucleotide sequence data reported are available in the third party annotation section of the ddbj/embl/genbank databases under the accession numbers tpa: bk007105-bk <dig> 

RESULTS
cdna library characteristics
a total of  <dig>  clones from the original sg cdna library of a. variegatum was assembled using a combination blast and cap <dig> pipeline  <cit> , producing  <dig>  nr sequences, or unigenes,  <dig>  of which are singlets; the remaining contigs were assembled from  <dig> to  <dig> expressed tag sequences . this assembly compares well with the tigr assembly  <cit> , which generated  <dig>  unigenes with  <dig>  singlets.

based on various blast sequence comparisons to several databases , these unigenes were functionally characterized into the following groups: putative secreted , putative housekeeping , transposable element-derived , and of unknown class , because they could not be classified  . thirty-two percent of ests belonged to the s class, smaller than other sialomes of insects and prostriate ticks  but similar to metastriate sialomes of rhipicephalus sanguineus, which had only 26% of its salivary ests attributed to the s class  <cit> . the s class was further subdivided in groups according to a previous tick salivary classification  <cit> .

the h class was further characterized  into  <dig> functional groups , the unknown conserved class being the most prevalent  <cit> .

transposable element  sequences are commonly found in sialotranscriptome. the sialotranscriptome of a. variegatum revealed both te class i and class ii transcripts, including tigger/pogo transposases. these sequences may represent active transposition or, more likely, the expression of regulatory sequences that might suppress the dna transposition phenomena  <cit> , as indicated by a tigger transposase message containing a stop codon .

analysis of the a. variegatum sialotranscriptome
several clusters of sequences coding for h and s polypeptides  are abundant and complete enough to extract consensus sequences that are typically absent from either genbank or swissprot. this analysis provides over  <dig> coding sequences,  <dig> of which have been submitted to genbank through the third-party annotation system. it is to be noted that as of july,  <dig>  there were only five protein sequences for a. variegatum deposited in genbank. these extracted sequences were grouped together in additional file  <dig>  a detailed description of the sialotranscriptome of a. variegatum follows to serve as a guide to browsing the two additional files. these two files are crosslinked to the tigr geneid assembly and annotation.

possibly secreted  class of expressed genes
this analysis is organized according to the groups of proteins indicated in our previous review  <cit> .

group 1: glycine-rich superfamily
this group of proteins represent the largest group of salivary ests from a. variegatum , totalling  <dig> ests and  <dig> unigenes from which  <dig> coding sequences  were extracted . the saliva of metastriate ticks is rich in glycine-rich proteins--many of which resemble spider filaments and mostly probably function in tick attachment to their hosts--and have been targets of anti-tick vaccines  <cit> . this group also includes smaller peptides, some of which are rich in glycine and tyrosine and resemble nematode antimicrobial peptides  <cit> .

group 2: mucins
under this class we include diverse serine + threonine-rich secreted proteins that have in common a large number of potential o-n-acetylgalactosylation sites as identified by the netoglyc server  <cit>  and can thus can be categorized as mucins. such proteins have been regularly found in sialotranscriptomes of insects and ticks, where they are postulated to help maintain the insect mouthparts in addition to other possible functions. ten such proteins are described in additional file  <dig>  including members with a chitin-binding domain.

group 3: antigen  <dig> proteins
the cap superfamily of proteins  has been found in most sialotranscriptomes of insects and ticks studied to date in the form of proteins similar to wasp-venom proteins and annotated as antigen- <dig>  <cit> . the functions of these proteins are very diverse, being associated with toxins in snake venoms,  <cit> , proteolytic activity in snails  <cit> , and immunoglobulin binding in salivary proteins of the stable fly  <cit> . for example, a member of this family expressed in tabanid sgs contains a disintegrin  domain and functions as a platelet aggregation inhibitor  <cit> . to date, no tick salivary members of this family have been functionally characterized. a 3' truncated cds for a member of this family is shown in additional file  <dig> 

group 4: ixodegrin superfamily
members of this family have 110- <dig> amino acids , many of which have the disintegrin arg-gly-asp  domain with nearby cysteine residues, a motif associated with disruption of fibrinogen binding to platelets  <cit> . the a. variegatum protein named amb_var- <dig> has similarities to i. scapularis ixodegrins, but it does not have the rgd domain. amb_var- <dig> is also similar to proteins annotated as astakine, which are related to the growth factor prokineticin, which is important for hematopoiesis  <cit> .

group 6: protease-inhibitor domains
kunitz domain-containing proteins
the kunitz domain is associated with proteins containing serine protease inhibitor activity as well as channel blockers. a single kunitz domain protein from r. appendiculatus was identified as a potassium channel blocker,  <cit>  while dual and five kunitz domain proteins from i. scapularis were identified as clotting inhibitors by acting on the tissue factor pathway  <cit> . additional file  <dig> presents  <dig> cds for kunitz domain-containing proteins from a. variegatum including amb_var- <dig>  with four kunitz domains, and amb_var- <dig>  amb_var- <dig>  amb_var- <dig>  and amb_var- <dig> with three domains, as indicated by the ku smart motif.

serpins
serpins are a ubiquitous protein family associated with the function of serine protease inhibition, from which the family name derives. a. variegatum serpins were identified in the original  <dig> sialome publication. four truncated cds are presented in additional file  <dig>  a single tick salivary serpin from i. ricinus has been shown to inhibit vertebrate elastase and to have immunosuppressive activity  <cit> . another salivary serpin from the same tick inhibits cathepsin g and chymase  <cit> . tick serpins have been proposed as anti-tick salivary vaccines, including non-salivary expressed serpins  <cit> .

cystatins
cystatins are cysteinyl protease inhibitors of nearly  <dig> aa in length. two salivary cystatins from i. scapularis have been functionally characterized as inhibitors of cathepsins l and s, to inhibit inflammation, suppress dendritic cell maturation, and serve as vaccine targets  <cit> . a 3' truncated member of this family is available in additional file  <dig> 

thyropins
thyropins are motifs found in thyroglobulins and in cysteine protease inhibitors of the actiniam-derived equistatin protein  <cit> . equistatin itself has three thyropin domains, two of which were shown to be involved in protease inhibition <cit> . two thyropin domains are discernible in amb_var- <dig> . no functional analysis of any tick thyropin has been done to date.

trypsin inhibitor-like  domain-containing proteins
the til domain is found in some serine protease inhibitors and antimicrobials  <cit> . peptides of this family have been isolated from tick eggs and shown to be inhibitors of elastase and subtilisin and to have antifungal activity  <cit> . the cds of amb_var- <dig> represents a salivary member of this family found in a. variegatum.

hirudin/madanin/variegin superfamily
this is a superfamily found only in metastriate ticks  <cit>  and includes the previously described peptide variegin from a. variegatum, shown to have antithrombin activity  <cit> ; it also contains madanin, an antithrombin from the tick haemaphysalis longicornis  <cit> , and a related protein from a. variegatum deposited in genbank in  <dig> . additional file  <dig> presents three additional members of this hirudin-like protein family, characterizing its possible multigene status within a. variegatum.

basic tail and  <dig> -kda superfamily
the basic tail and  <dig> -kda superfamily was first recognized in i. scapularis, where many members have repeats of basic aa in their carboxytermini. other members have an acidic tail, and others lack the charged tail but can be recognized by the pfam domain named tick salivary peptide group  <dig>  the i. scapularis  <dig> -kda family was found by psi-blast to be related to the basic tail family. two members of this family in i. scapularis have been characterized as anticlotting agents  <cit> . additional file  <dig> introduces the cds for four members of this family from a. variegatum.

group 7: lipocalins
lipocalins are ubiquitous proteins characterized by a barrel shape that often carries lipophylic compounds . in blood-sucking insects and ticks, lipocalins bind not only lipidic compounds, such as leukotrienes and thromboxane a <dig>  <cit> , but also charged agonists of inflammation, such as serotonin and histamine  <cit> . lipocalins can also have functions unrelated to their small molecule binding function, such as anticlotting  <cit>  and anticomplement function  <cit> . seven cds for a. variegatum lipocalins are presented in additional file  <dig> 

group 8:  <dig> -kda polypeptide family
the  <dig> -kda polypeptide family is exclusive to hard ticks,  <dig> members of which were described previously  <cit> . amb_var- <dig> represents an a. variegatum member of the family.

group 11: 12-kda polypeptide family
this is another protein family exclusive of hard and soft ticks, previously found only in i. scapularis, ornithodoros coriaceus, and ornithodoros. moubata  <cit> . three members from a. variegatum are shown in additional file  <dig>  expanding the members of this unique family. alignment of the tick sequences allows for a bootstrapped phylogram indicating strong bootstrap support for two clades .

group 14: cytotoxin-like family
thus far, the cytotoxin-like protein family has been found only in the ixodes genus and in soft ticks. two additional proteins from a. variegatum add metastriate proteins to this unique tick family.

group 16: enzymes
some of the enzymes listed below could serve an h function, but are related to enzymes previously found secreted and thus are described in the s group.

apyrase/5' nucleotidases
apyrases are enzymes that hydrolyze tri- and di-phosphonucleotides to their monophosphate esters plus inorganic phosphate. they are commonly found in the saliva of blood-sucking arthropods, where they degrade atp and adp, important agonists of neutrophil  <cit>  and platelet aggregation  <cit> . the salivary apyrase of mosquitoes, triatomines of the genus triatoma and ticks have been identified as members of the 5'-nucleotidase family  <cit> . while most members of the 5' nucleotidase family are membrane-bound ectoenzymes by virtue of a glycosylinositol lipid anchor, the secreted apyrases lack the carboxyterminus region where the anchor is located. amb_var- <dig>  is a 3' truncated member of this family, and for this reason, the lack of the anchor site cannot be evaluated.

endonucleases
endonucleases were found in saliva of culex and sand flies, where they may serve a function in decreasing the viscosity of the feeding lesion and produce antiinflammatory nucleotides  <cit> . three truncated members of this family of enzymes are presented in additional file  <dig> 

sphingomyelin phosphodiesterases
sphingomyelin metabolites are important regulators of cell growth, inflammation, and immunity  <cit> . a fragment of an enzyme-targeting sphingomyelin is identified.

epoxide hydrolases
two truncated members of this family of enzymes were found that could act in the metabolism of arachidonate metabolites.

oxidant metabolism enzymes
a peroxidasin fragment, a superoxide dismutase, and two selenoproteins are reported in additional file  <dig>  these proteins have the potential to regulate the toxic products of oxygen and nitric oxide  <cit> .

proteases
carboxypeptidases, dipeptidyl peptidases, metalloproteases of the reprolysin family, and trypsin-like serine proteases are presented in additional file  <dig>  carboxypeptidases and dipeptidyl peptidases could act in the destruction of inflammatory peptidic agonists. in fact, a dipeptidyl peptidase was shown to be responsible for the very fast bradykinin degradation caused by i. scapularis saliva  <cit> . metalloproteases in the saliva of i. scapularis were shown to be responsible for the fibrinolytic activity  <cit> . salivary serine proteases have been shown to have fibrinolytic activities in horse flies  <cit> .

group 17: immunity related
a member of the ficolin family, named ixoderin in ticks  <cit> , is identified. these proteins have a lectin and a fibrinogen-like domain and are associated with activation of the colectin pathway of complement activation in vertebrates and invertebrates  <cit> .

group 18: metastriate-specific families
several protein families found only in metastriate ticks were identified in our previous review of tick sialomes  <cit> . seven of these families were also found in the a. variegatum sialome, including three multigene families that appear to be unique to a. variegatum, as follows:

da-p <dig> immunosuppressant
the first member of this family was described as an immunosuppressant found in the sgs of dermacentor andersoni  <cit> . the a. variegatum sialome reveals four members of this family, one of which was reported in figure  <dig> of the original  <dig> paper  <cit> . one additional sequence from a. variegatum was deposited in genbank in  <dig> , but has no associated publication. alignment of the related sequences  reveals one small conserved region characterized by the block -x--x--p--x---x-, indicating the divergence of the family. the bootstrapped phylogram shows strong support for one clade containing amblyomma, dermacentor, and rhipicephalus sequences . other clades do not have sufficient bootstrap support , except for two a. variegatum sequences that are over 20% divergent. the phylogram supports a common origin of this multigene family in metastriate ticks.

metastriate insulin growth factor-binding protein
this protein family was discovered from the assembly of ests from ticks, as described in a previous review  <cit> . members of this family produce matches to go proteins annotated as "insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7" and have the ib smart domain for "insulin growth factor-binding protein homologues." this family actually has two sets. a shorter form contains only the ib domain , while the longer form has, in addition of the ib domain, a kazal domain and the smart immunoglobulin c- <dig> type domain . alignment of all ib-containing proteins  shows the conserved ib domain motif in the amino terminal end of the mature protein, indicated by the block pa c-x--c-x-g-x-c-g-c-c-x-c-x--x-pa c-x-c-x--x-c. alignment of the long-form sequences shows three very conserved proteins in rhipicephalus microplus, r. appendiculatus, and a. variegatum, containing a signal peptide followed by the ib, kazal, and immunoglobulin domains . this degree of conservation is more common among housekeeping proteins, as they are not under host immune pressure. proteins containing these three domains are characterized by the interpro insulin-like growth factor binding protein  <dig> http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/ispy?ac=q <dig>  the human homolog having this domain structure , named mc <dig> or igfbp <dig>  has many effects in tissue growth and differentiation  <cit> , it has also been shown to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor and keratinocyte growth  <cit> . if any of these proteins are secreted, they could serve as binders of growth factors affecting angiogenesis, tissue repair, and immunity.

a. variegatum-specific proteins
additional file  <dig> contains two families of proteins that appear to be species specific, namely the avar family <dig> kda  and avar family  <dig> kda . within each family, the members are less than 50% identical, indicating gene duplication events followed by divergence. additional file  <dig> presents  <dig> additional protein sequences that have a putative signal peptide indicative of secretion but have no similarity to any known protein, including the recently released i. scapularis proteome. it is possible that some of these cds may derive from the 3' region of transporters or other transmembrane proteins, as these regions may produce a positive signal peptide.

a. variegatum proteins not found in previous sialotranscriptome, but similar to putative i. scapularis proteins
additional file  <dig> contains  <dig> proteins from a. variegatum that are similar to i. scapularis proteins but have not been found in previous sialomes. some of these are proline-rich, low-complexity proteins or histidine-rich proteins.

group 21: secreted conserved proteins
forty-five proteins with signal peptide indicative of secretion are presented in additional file  <dig>  most of these are of the class "unknown conserved"  <cit>  but also include calreticulin, which has a typical kheel carboxydomain indicative of endoplasmic reticulum retention but was shown to be a marker of tick exposure  <cit> .

group 22: housekeeping proteins
additional file  <dig> presents  <dig> cds for proteins associated with various cellular functions. additionally,  <dig> of the unknown conserved and  <dig> transposable element fragments were extracted.

preliminary characterization of the salivary proteome of a. variegatum
to obtain information on protein expression in the sgs of a. variegatum, we performed a one dimensional  gel electrophoresis separation of the sg homogenate followed by proteolytic digest of the  <dig> cored sections indicated in figure  <dig> and subsequent tandem mass spectrometry  of the tryptic peptides. additional files  <dig> and  <dig> show the matching sequence hits obtained by ms/ms. a total of  <dig> proteins were identified in the gel fractions by two or more ions derived from the same gel fraction. an additional  <dig> proteins were identified from a single ion on the same spot. these matches are shown in the worksheet named gel-ms-ms results in additional file  <dig>  figure  <dig> displays the electrophoresis gel, indicating  <dig> proteins associated with blood feeding. these include large and small glycine-rich proteins, the most abundant group found in the transcriptome and by ms. reprolysin-type metalloprotease and dipeptidyl peptidase are found in band  <dig>  with their expected molecular masses . calreticulin, citotoxin-like protein, one lipocalin, and four hypothetical secreted proteins are also shown in figure  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the detailed re-analysis of the transcriptome of a. variegatum, in light of the emerging pattern of protein families in tick sialomes, extends and confirms common components in the saliva, such as the recruitment of metalloproteases, protease inhibitors, lipocalins, and several other unique families--such as the  <dig> -kda, 11-12-kda, and cytotoxin-like--common to metastriate and prostriate ticks. a. variegatum also has a large set of transcripts coding for cement-like proteins unique to metastriate ticks. in parallel with this transcript abundance, glycine-rich proteins were the largest group of proteins identified by proteomics, when secreted proteins are considered. other unique metastriate protein families were identified, including some that appear to be multigenic and also unique to a. variegatum such as the avar 10-kda and avar 8-kda families. many orphan proteins were further characterized. further transcriptome analysis of other amblyomma ticks may reveal relatives of these unique proteins.

most of the proteins described have no known function but, if secreted into their hosts, they should have antihemostatic, antiinflammatory, anti-angiogenic, or immunomodulatory function. they may also contain antimicrobial activity. as the sialome puzzle emerges, the task of functional characterization of these novel protein families becomes possible.
