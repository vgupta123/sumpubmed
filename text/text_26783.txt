BACKGROUND
protein-structure alignment remains a great challenge in structural genomics and constitutes an important tool for applications in protein classification, protein-structure prediction, drug design and studies of evolutionary relationships. the number of known three-dimensional protein structures determined by nmr spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography is increasing rapidly. at the end of the year  <dig> the protein data bank   <cit>  contained more than  <dig>  protein structures. hence, efficient methods to detect structural similarity among different proteins, analogous to methods for sequence alignment are clearly needed.

the pairwise protein-structure alignment problem can be defined as the task of identifying maximal common substructures of two proteins according to a given similarity measure. algorithms solving this problem use different representations of protein structures. grath  <cit> , ssm  <cit> , top <cit> , tops  <cit> , matras  <cit> , protep  <cit>  and vast  <cit>  work on protein secondary structure level only. such secondary-structure representation is also used for index-based database searches  <cit> . dali  <cit> , ce  <cit> , ssap  <cit> , fase  <cit>  and scali  <cit>  work on the residue level or a combination of secondary-structure and residue level. another approach employs methods derived from computer vision to compare 3d models  <cit> . topscan  <cit>  uses topology string representations. other approaches tackle even the problem of aligning multiple structures  <cit> . theoretical work characterizing protein architectures focused initially on pure β-strand proteins  <cit>  or on pure a-helical proteins  <cit> . proteins of mixed topology containing a-helices and β-strands were considered as undirected labeled graphs  <cit> .

useful comparison of three-dimensional protein structures require a structure-similarity score that is transferable to biological and chemical classifications reflecting protein architectures. several measures for protein-structure similarity have been proposed. the root mean square deviation  of equivalent atom positions of a protein pair  <cit>  is widely used. other similarity measures are distance map similarity  <cit>  and contact map overlap   <cit> , which employ residue pair distances and contacts, respectively. cmo is based on the notion of contacts between two residues. a contact map captures a 3d structure in condensed form, representing the 3d protein conformation as a symmetrical, square, boolean matrix of contacts. such contact maps are also used as basic information to elucidate protein structures from nmr spectroscopy  <cit> . although they simplify the description of protein structures, they still provide all necessary information to reconstruct a protein structure with sufficiently high accuracy. in the cmo approach, the protein-structure alignment problem is solved by analyzing the similarity of their contact maps. cmo-based structure alignment was introduced by godzik and skolnick  <cit>  and was proved to be np-hard by goldman et al.  <cit> . however, caprara et al.  <cit>  succeeded with integer programming to get solutions for maximum cmo of protein-structure pairs in reasonable cpu times. nevertheless, the protein-structure alignment problem is computationally hard to solve.

to reduce the computational burden of protein-structure alignment connected with direct use of pairwise-residue assignment, we employ in the present study a hierarchical approach. on the first level of the hierarchy, protein-structure alignment of sses is performed. on the second level, solutions for the cmo are searched on the residue level. in analogy to protein sequence alignment, structure alignment methods can work with either a global or a local strategy. global strategies start from whole structures and remove poorly matched parts of the structure. in contrast, local strategies start from small matching units and attempt to enlarge and merge these. the presented method  uses a global strategy.

protein architectures are essentially defined by the spatial arrangement of α-helices and β-strands . these sses generally form the central part of protein structures, while loop, turn and coil structures are more irregular and preferentially localized on the protein surfaces. furthermore, the composition and arrangement of a-helices and β-strands are highly conserved evolutionary in contrast to the conformations of loops, turns and coils connecting these sses. hence, restriction to these sses is advantageous for structure comparison, since it focuses on the regular parts of the structure, which can be characterized more compactly, thereby facilitates recognition of structural similarity. gangsta considers only these regularly structured sses, which greatly reduces the complexity of the protein-structure alignment problem and facilitates structure alignments with non-sequential sse connectivity.

it is a widely assumed that similar protein structures can be aligned while the sse connectivity in the polypeptide chain  is conserved. nevertheless, a considerable number of proteins possess different sse connectivity but share the same architecture . it has been shown that permuted sse alignments  occur often  <cit> . structure alignments involving proteins of different sse connectivities pose a computational challenge. using protein representations in terms of graphs on the secondary-structure level, we can describe structure alignment as a search for the maximum common subgraph  <cit> , a problem that is known to be np-complete. therefore, we decided to use a genetic algorithm  to perform connectivity-independent alignments on the sse level, since evolutionary algorithms provide reasonable strategies to solve np-complete problems  <cit> . gas have been used previously for structural alignment  <cit>  and for detecting appropriate structure templates in homology modeling  <cit> . only few methods, such as sarf  <cit> , k <dig>  <cit> , mass  <cit>  or scali  <cit> , can align protein-structure fragments in non-sequential order. however, none of these methods optimizes the matching of protein graphs.

gangsta was developed to produce high quality global protein-structure alignments independent of sse connectivity by optimizing the contact map overlap. the method can be used for pairwise protein-structure alignment or fast database searches with respect to a specific protein structure and is available through a web server  <cit> . for the case of pairwise structure alignment, we provide a statistical significance related to our similarity measure in the form of a p-value, the probability that a better score can be reached by structure alignment of unrelated proteins. the performance of gangsta was assessed in pairwise structure alignments and database scans with sequential and non-sequential sse connectivity. we show gangsta's ability to detect structural similarity of protein folds that are assigned to different superfamilies but nevertheless posses similar structures and perform related functions, even if these proteins differ in sse connectivity.

RESULTS
protein-structure alignment with gangsta: an example
to demonstrate the capability of gangsta to find protein structures with different sse connectivities, we consider the structure alignment of the two scop domains 2uaga <dig> and 1gkub <dig>  in cath  <cit>  these protein domains correspond to 2uaga <dig> and 1gkub <dig>  respectively. the name convention of protein domains in scop and cath are as follows: {pdb_id|chain_id|domain_id} for instance {2uag|a|01}. they share the same protein-structure class  but belong to different fold and superfamily categories in scop. both structures have an incomplete rossmann structure motif  <cit>  in common. the rossmann structure motif is ubiquitous in the universe of protein structures. it occurs with different sse connectivities and comprises four α-helices and four β-strands. in the incomplete rossmann structure motif one dangling α-helix is missing. generally, it serves as a device for binding functionally relevant cofactors, such as nucleotide diphosphates and flavins.

in the scop classification scheme  <cit> , the polypeptides 2uaga <dig> and 1gkub <dig> belong to the folds "murcd n-terminal domain" and "p-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", respectively. in cath  <cit> , these two polypeptides are classified in the homologous superfamilies "nad-binding with rossmann-like domain" and "p-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase", respectively. both proteins share the same level of cath topology "rossmann-fold".

in the pairwise structure alignment mode the smaller protein structure  is superimposed on the larger protein structure . in the target structure only the sses useful for the alignment are considered, while the omission of an sse in the source structure  is penalized . fig.  <dig> shows the result of the gangsta structure alignment for the two polypeptides as superposition of aligned sses. table  <dig> summarizes results obtained from the pairwise structure alignment of the complete set of sses of source structure 2uaga <dig> on the target structure 1gkub <dig>  although the two protein domains possess different sse connectivities, gangsta was able to align them with a good p-value  considering all sses of the source structure .

significance of the gangsta score for pairwise structure alignments
one important application of protein-structure alignment is to find out whether a pair of proteins is structurally or evolutionarily related. scop or cath databases are often used for such a classification task. whether the similarity measure employed in gangsta  is suitable to assign two protein structures to the same scop superfamily was tested by a statistical study similar to the one described in  <cit> . for that purpose, we performed structure alignments of  <dig> protein domain pairs where both proteins belong to the same scop superfamily  and  <dig> structure alignments of domains pairs where both proteins belong to different scop superfamilies . the two datasets are explained in more detail in the method section. for the protein-structure alignments from both datasets the distributions of gangsta scores are shown in fig.  <dig>  a gumbel distribution was fitted to the gangsta score distribution of the diff_sf <dig> dataset with mean μ =  <dig>  and standard deviation σ =  <dig>  , as described in the method section. according to fig.  <dig>  the distributions of gangsta scores of the two datasets overlap partially. hence, it is not possible to conclude reliably from the similarity of two protein structures that they belong to the same superfamily of proteins. the ability of the gangsta score to discriminate between related and non-related protein structures can be illustrated as coverage versus error rate plot as shown in fig. s <dig> of supplement data   <cit>  evaluated according to ortiz et al.  <cit> . in short, the coverage is the ratio of true positives at a given p-value threshold, while the error rate defines the number of false positives for that threshold. in the above application, gangsta is able to detect 48% and 67% of the scop superfamily relationships at a confidence level of 99% and 95%, respectively.

gangsta structure alignments with non-sequential sse connectivity
we studied the performance of gangsta for alignment of protein structures with non-sequential sse connectivity that are known from literature . additionally, we show significant alignments of protein structures with non-sequential sse connectivity involving the rossmann and rossmann-like structure motif according to classifications in scop or cath. all comparisons were done in the pairwise structure alignment mode using stride  <cit>  for sse assignment.

four-helix bundles
as a first application we selected the protein domain 2hmza as reference structure for four-helix-bundles and aligned it pairwise with the nine other protein domains from the four-helix-bundle dataset . for all pairwise alignments the sse assignment , the gangsta score, p-value, and rmsd are listed. gangsta was able to align all structures within 95% confidence level. only three protein domains  were not aligned within 99% confidence level and they all contain alignment gaps . all structure alignments were superimposed with an rmsd smaller than  <dig>  Å. it is noteworthy that only the alignment of 256a with the reference structure 2hmza is optimal with sequential sse connectivity. fig.  <dig> shows the structural superposition of the two protein domains 2hmza and 3inkc.

β-strands of traf immunoglobin dataset
we aligned the reference structure 1frtb against all other seven domains of the traf dataset . gangsta was able to align six of the seven proteins within 95% confidence threshold. only protein domain 1k2fa could not be aligned with a significant p-value . this is the only protein in the traf dataset that could be aligned to the reference structure if two gaps are introduced in the 1k2fa structure, resulting in a structure superposition with  <dig>  Å rmsd. for all other structures the corresponding rmsds are smaller than  <dig>  Å. all structure alignments of 1frtb with proteins from different families possess different sse connectivities: only the structure alignments with members of the same family as the reference structure  possess the same sse connectivity. fig.  <dig> shows the superposition of 1frtb with 1czya  and with 1kzza , two proteins from scop superfamilies that differ from 1frtb. both alignments are non-sequential in sse connectivity relative to 1frtb.

rossmann structure motif
here we consider a sufficiently complex and widespread structure motif, the rossmann structure motif  <cit> , which was first identified in dinucleotide-binding proteins. we used the scop domain 2uaga <dig> as reference structure and the rossmann dataset  as target structures. six of the seven proteins are classified as rossmann-fold in cath topology level except 1dhs, which is classified in scop as rossmann-fold. the results are shown in fig.  <dig>  gangsta was able to align all proteins with the reference structure 2uaga <dig> within the 99% confidence level. all alignments were non-sequential with respect to the sse connectivity of the reference structure, and all superpositions could be made with rmsd smaller than  <dig>  Å.

robustness of gangsta
the following tests are made to demonstrate the robustness of gangsta against variations in structure and sse connectivity for a given fold motif. these tests also demonstrate that gangsta can retrieve approximately the same set of target structures when different source structures of the same motif are used. this symmetric behavior is an important feature that makes gangsta suitable for database scans. to assess these features we performed the following tasks.

 <dig>  a database scan with 2uaga <dig>  as reference structure  was conducted. the results were clustered according to the sse connectivity pattern with respect to the reference structure.

 <dig>  two new reference structures were generated by considering only the aligned sses   of 1dhs and 1cjca <dig>  these proteins belong to the two largest clusters containing structures of different sse connectivity  that were obtained from the preceding database scan. the corresponding reduced structures were used as reference  structures for two additional database scans.

 <dig>  the results obtained from all three database scans  were compared to determine whether gangsta is able to retrieve the same set of similar structures despite variations in the reference structures.

since gangsta returns all alignments for a database scan, we used a cutoff at a gangsta score , of  <dig> . this cutoff corresponds to a p-value of  <dig> , giving a significance level of 87% for pairwise structure alignment. since we are using an estimated contact overlap q  for database scans, this p-value is only an upper bound on the real structure similarity and serves only as selection criterion sufficient for this experiment.

for the first task, the top  <dig> structure alignments with non-sequential sse connectivity were monitored. the last of these structures was found at rank position  <dig>  we considered in the following all aligned structures  of a rank lower then or equal to  <dig>  from this set of  <dig> structures, the alignments involving gaps in the source structure were omitted. this yields a total of  <dig> structures  that can be aligned with a significance level of 99% or higher against the reference structure . these  <dig> protein structures were then grouped into clusters containing the same sse connectivity as the reference structure . this results in  <dig> different clusters . for the subsequent two tasks, we considered the largest two clusters  of structures with sse connectivities different from the reference structure 2uaga <dig> .

c average statistics over all  <dig> structure alignments against the complete 2uaga <dig> structure.

for the second task, we chose two representative incomplete rossmann structure motifs from the two largest clusters with non-sequential sse connectivity: 1dhs and 1cjca <dig>  since both structures are larger than 2uaga <dig>  we reduced them to the aligned sses: 1dhs and 1cjca <dig>  respectively. we performed a database scan with these two reduced reference structures to obtain result sets  <dig> and  <dig>  finally , we compared the structures from the two largest clusters in result set  <dig>  with those retrieved by alignment with either 1dhs or 1cjca <dig> or with both. fig.  <dig> lists the results of this assessment. from  <dig> structures found with 2uaga <dig> as reference structure we retrieved  <dig> with 1dhs and  <dig> with 1cjca <dig> as reference structure .

protein-structure alignment tasks with sequential sse connectivity
most programs or servers for protein-structure alignment deal with sequential structure alignments only and most of the known curated structure alignments or benchmark sets for structure alignment are constructed to test methods preserving the sequential sse connectivity. to obtain a more representative comparison with other alignment methods we tested the performance of gangsta for structure alignments with exclusively sequential sse connectivity.

the two structure alignment tasks we conducted here complement the evaluation of web-based programs and servers for structure alignment applied in recent performance tests by novotny et al.  <cit> . the authors identified protein structures as true positives  by using cath classification  <cit> . the various servers evaluated in  <cit>  all use different databases and scoring systems, so simple counting of true positives was not feasible. therefore, we used a simple binary scoring system: at least one true positive either was or was not found in the list of significant hits. for servers that did not indicate the significance of the hits, up to  <dig> hits were examined. this was done for gangsta as well, see below. a true positive was defined on the topology level in the cath classification scheme. each reference structure was submitted to all servers evaluated in the novotny study, and it was determined whether any of the structures, other than the reference structure, were found as true positive. to have a similar test scenario, we decided to reproduce these structure alignment tasks using the database scan version of gangsta. all database scans were performed using dssp for sse assignment. we used the gangsta score  to rank the resulting structure alignments. however, no p-value could be evaluated, since for database scans gangsta calculates only an estimated contact map overlap q  to increase the computational performance .

the first task was based on a selection of protein domains  belonging to four different cath classes  as used in  <cit> . proteins from the fourth cath class  have only low secondary structure content and thus few sse contacts. since gangsta considers α-helices and β-strands only, we tested it only on those proteins of the novotny dataset  belonging to cath classes mainly-α, mainly-β and mixed-α-β. this resulted in  <dig> reference proteins . the results of the structure alignment with gangsta and  <dig> other methods are shown in table  <dig>  except for the data obtained with gangsta all data were taken from the literature  <cit> . average performances differ slightly from the literature values, since the structures with low secondary structure content were omitted. in analogy to the preceding investigations on the novotny dataset  <cit>  the assignment of a reference structure was successful with gangsta, if at least one target with appropriate cath topology was found among the top  <dig> ranked protein domains. gangsta was able to detect true positives for  <dig> of all  <dig> reference structures  of the reduced novotny dataset except for the mainly-α protein 1c3u. this protein had been moved to another topology in more recent cath versions  <cit>  , so we could not compare the gangsta results to results listed for other methods. hence, gangsta reaches the best result possible for the reduced novotny dataset.

except for gangsta all data were taken from literature  <cit> . average performances differ slightly, since structures with low secondary structure content were omitted. the  <dig> proteins of the novotny dataset  were aligned against the scop <dig> reference database. for the gangsta evaluation the assignment of a reference structure was successful, if at least one target with appropriate cath topology was found among the top  <dig> ranked protein domains.

b since protein 1c3u was moved to another topology class in more recent cath versions,  <dig> is the maximum number of correct structure alignments achievable. thus, preventing gangsta from reaching the maximum performance of 100% .

the second task considers a database search with eleven pairs of structures from the fischer dataset  that were considered as difficult structure alignment cases  <cit>  before. according to novotny et al.  <cit> , a search was considered to be successful, if for a reference structure the defined result structure or a homologous structure was found. again true positives were searched among the top  <dig> ranked targets from structure alignment. gangsta was able to find appropriate result structures for each of the eleven protein pairs . seven results were found at top  <dig> position, eight within the top  <dig>  and all within the top  <dig> ranked structures. hence, in this test gangsta outperforms dali and ce, which both found ten out of eleven possible structure pairs  <cit> .

for all  <dig> fischer pairs the structures from the database are given, which are most similar to the specified target structure together with their rank and cath classification.

implementation
the gangsta structure-alignment method is implemented in c++ in a first version only for unix systems. it is available as web application at  <cit> . the user can perform pairwise structure alignments or database searches against a library of 3d structures. the database in use is the scop <dig> . the assignment of secondary structure can be done with dssp  <cit> , stride  <cit>  or according to the helix/sheets records in pdb  <cit>  files. in table s <dig>  the runtimes for some exemplary pairwise structure alignments and database searches are shown. all calculations were done on a linux amd opteron  <dig> system, using one thread for the entire program including all initializations.

discussion
we have tested gangsta on different datasets to assess its performance for challenging tasks in protein-structure alignment. these include  classification of protein superfamilies,  searching for structure alignments with non-sequential sse connectivity,  testing robustness against structural variation, and  comparison with other methods considering datasets of protein structures that require sequential sse connectivity.

we could show that for structure alignments from different scop superfamilies the distribution of gangsta scores follows the well known gumbel distribution. the same distribution was reported by levitt and gerstein  <cit> , mammoth  <cit>  and fase  <cit> , which use different measures of structural similarity and different optimization algorithms. the discrimination between structurally related and non-related proteins , 67%  true positives were found by gangsta as pictured in the coverage-error plot in fig. s <dig> ) is comparable with other methods. at a confidence level of 99% prism  <cit>  reported 54% and mammoth  <cit>  50% true positives. at a confidence level of 95% mammoth reported 60% and fase  <cit>  72% true positives. in contrast to these studies gangsta reports the p-value for scop superfamily classification instead of scop fold classification. this test is more demanding, since protein structures may share the same scop fold but belong to different scop superfamilies.

generally protein-structure alignments are validated using classification schemes that discriminate according to specified criteria between related and un-related structures. for this purpose most studies use the cath or scop database of classified proteins. however, these databases were also generated with specific classification criteria, which naturally may build in biases. this adds to the difficulties of fairly comparing different methods of protein-structure alignment. kolodny et al.  <cit>  showed that comparisons based on receiver operating characteristic  curves are often unsatisfactory with respect to the quality of protein-structure alignment. so far, the best insight into the quality of a protein-structure alignments can be obtained by visual inspection. this depends on the structural and functional features upon which the viewer focuses and is obviously subjective in nature.

protein-structure alignments from different scop families and superfamilies have demonstrated that gangsta is able to find reasonable structure alignments that may provide new insights for structure-function relationships of proteins and also for structural motifs that occur with different sse connectivities. the results for the rossmann dataset demonstrate that gangsta finds structural similarities for proteins that are known to have similar function but no obvious structural or sequence similarity. the rossmann structure motifs are ubiquitous, appearing in the large enzyme family of kinases  <cit>  that catalyze the transfer of phosphate groups. in these proteins, the rossmann structure motif constitutes just a small fraction of the whole structure, which can differ significantly in the remaining part of the structure. hence, scop classifies these proteins in different superfamilies, such as murcd n-terminal domain, fad/nad-binding domain, had-like, nad-binding rossmann-fold domains, dhs-like nad/fad-binding domain, udp-glycosyltransferase/glycogen phosphorylase, and flavodoxin-like. the structural similarity found by gangsta hints at functional similarity in nucleotide binding. gangsta is able to detect the structural similarity of those proteins despite their topological differences with respect to sse connectivity. protein structures with different sse connectivity often exhibit large structural variations in terms of rmsd, but can simultaneously have large contact overlaps and a gangsta score  close to zero, corresponding to high quality structure alignment.

in a test for robustness of gangsta the incomplete rossmann structure motif 2uaga <dig> could be retrieved with database scans using 1dhs or 1cjca <dig> as reference structure. the robustness also demonstrates the symmetric behavior of gangsta. from the  <dig> structures found with 2uaga <dig> from the largest three clusters   <dig>  and  <dig>  were retrieved by structure alignment on database scans with the rossmann structure motif taken from the structures 1dhs and 1cjca <dig>  respectively, although there are large variations in the rossmann structure motif of these three reference structures . the fact that variation in sse connectivity did not influence the retrieval of similar structures is not surprising, since gangsta considers the sses as independent secondary structure elements and disregards the connecting polypeptide loops.

analog to a recent study  <cit> , gangsta found different clusters of protein domains with different sse connectivities for the rossmann structure motif. among these aligned structures with non-sequential sse connectivities are protein domains belonging to different cath  <cit>  topology levels or different scop  <cit>  fold levels. hence, gangsta is able recognize structure similarities of protein domains that share the same cath architecture but belong to different cath topologies. thus, gangsta may be useful to classify protein structure domains. rossmann structure motifs with different sse connectivities carry out similar functions, which is a clear example of convergent evolution. the fact that protein function can be correlated with cath architecture rather than the more detailed cath topology is an interesting observation.

although gangsta was designed and implemented specifically to find unusual protein-structure alignments with non-sequential sse connectivity that are hard to detect, we could show that even for sequential sse connectivity gangsta is able to compete with other established protein-structure alignment methods like dali  <cit> , vast  <cit> , yakusa  <cit> , and ce  <cit> . regarding the number of aligned residues and the overall rmsd results individual pairwise protein-structure alignments with gangsta are generally somewhat inferior to the results obtained with other methods. but, for the more imprecise database scan method gangsta outperforms structure-alignment methods that consider sequential sse connectivity only.

CONCLUSIONS
gangsta is able to find meaningful protein-structure alignments independent of the sse connectivity. the rmsd is often used as a similarity measure for structure alignment. we could show that functionally related protein domains can have large structural variations in terms of rmsd. the contact map overlap  and the newly introduced gangsta score  can identify structures with different sse connectivity not detectable by methods maintaining sse connectivity. structure-alignment methods considering the geometry of loops that connect the regularly structured sses  in a protein have a strong bias for sequential sse connectivity. hence, these methods have difficulty finding structural alignments that are non-sequential in sse connectivity.

even if a protein fold cannot be aligned to another protein structure while maintaining the sse connectivity, structural similarity may still exist for different sse connectivities despite large rmsd. gangsta tends to align large fold motifs regardless of sse connectivity. this is due to the following features.  gangsta does not optimize distances between residue pairs, but maximizes the number of residue pair contacts.  the number of gaps  is restricted to make sure that a maximum number of of sses and consequently also of residues are aligned.  gangsta ignores loop structures, which helps to find structure alignments that are non-sequential in sse connectivity.
