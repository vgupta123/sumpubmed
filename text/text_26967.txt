BACKGROUND
mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis  causes paratuberculosis or johne's disease, a fatal chronic granulomatous enteritis. the disease occurs worldwide and is responsible for significant economic losses to livestock and associated industries  <cit> . it is endemic in europe with only sweden maintaining paratuberculosis-free status. the epidemiology is poorly understood and there are important questions still to resolve, particularly with respect to interspecies transmission. map infects principally ruminants but over the past decade it has become apparent that the organism has a much broader host range including monogastric species  <cit> . the infection of humans with map and possible association with crohn's disease remains a controversial issue and requires more study  <cit> . the strain types involved and the extent to which interspecies transmission occurs have still to be elucidated. evidence also is accumulating regarding the existence of potential wildlife reservoirs, for example, infected rabbits appear to be a particular problem in some areas of scotland  <cit>  but the role of such wildlife reservoirs in the epidemiology of the disease has still to be clarified.

our knowledge and understanding of the epidemiology of map has been hindered for many years by our inability to discriminate map from the environmental species of mycobacterium avium  and to differentiate between map isolates from different host species and different geographic locations. recent advances in molecular biology have led to the refinement and development of molecular typing methods with sufficient discriminatory power to differentiate between m. avium subspecies and different map isolates  <cit> . genome analyses have revealed two major strain groups designated 'type i', or 'sheep or s type' and 'type ii' or 'cattle or c type'. a sub-type of type i strains designated 'type iii' or 'intermediate or i type' is found in sheep and goats. all three of these strain types can be differentiated by restriction fragment length polymorphism coupled with hybridization to is <dig>   <cit>  or pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  analyses  <cit>  and by a pcr assay based on single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gyra and gyrb genes  <cit> . single nucleotide polymorphisms in the is <dig> element also distinguish three types designated 's' , 'c'  and 'b'   <cit> . in this case the assay cannot distinguish between types i and iii and the 'b' type is a sub-type of type ii strains. in silico genome comparisons and techniques such as representational difference analysis and microarray analysis have identified sequence polymorphisms unique to either type i or ii strains and these have been used to develop pcrs for discriminating these strain groups  <cit> . the purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular diversity of map isolates from a variety of hosts across europe to enhance our understanding of the host range and distribution of the organisms and assess the potential for interspecies transmission. previous studies have revealed limited genetic diversity; therefore, to maximise strain differentiation we evaluated several different molecular typing techniques in isolation and in combination; is900-rflp, pfge and pcr-based techniques including amplified fragment length polymorphisms  and mycobacterial interspersed repeat unit-variable number tandem repeat .

RESULTS
aflp typing was performed at the central institute of wageningen university, lelystad, the netherlands and miru-vntr at inra, nouzilly, france. for pfge and is900-rflp typing, the field isolates were split between two labs. pfge typing was undertaken at the moredun research institute, scotland, uk and visavet, madrid, spain. is900-rflp typing was carried out at the veterinary research institute in brno, czech republic and visavet. published standardized typing procedures were used as described in materials and methods. the only difference in procedures between laboratories was that at visavet the is900-rflp analysis was performed using the agarose plugs prepared for pfge to avoid having to perform two separate dna preparations for the different typing techniques. the correct profiles were reported by all laboratories for the duplicate isolates included to check reproducibility. all typing techniques correctly reported that the mycobacterium phlei , mycobacterium bovis bcg  and is <dig> positive m. avium were not map. one field isolate, eu <dig> was found to be is <dig> positive m. avium  and not map as was originally suspected. another isolate, eu <dig> was found to be a mixed culture. isolates one to  <dig> were typed at institut für mikrobiologie stiftung tierärztliche hochschule hannover, hannover, germany using the type i/type ii pcr as described by dohmann et al.  <cit> . eu <dig> and eu <dig> were identified as type i and all other field isolates as type ii. these results correlated with the strain type as determined by pfge. this pcr  <cit>  cannot discriminate between type i and type iii and as strain types could be discerned from the pfge profiles, it was not considered necessary to determine the strain type of the remaining isolates by pcr. it was not possible to type all of the isolates with all typing methods as some laboratories had difficulties in subculturing some isolates to prepare sufficient cells for analyses. a total of  <dig> map isolates were typed by is900-rflp, pfge and miru-vntr.

is900-rflp typing
is900-rflp typing data were obtained for  <dig> map isolates . it was not possible to obtain psti profiles for  <dig> isolates or clear bsteii profiles for five isolates. there was a problem using agarose plug dna for is900-rflp typing with psti as the enzyme would not cleave in the presence of agarose. extraction of the dna from the agarose and repeat psti digestion was not attempted. as expected, profiles were not obtained for the negative control strains m. bovis bcg, m. phlei and is <dig> positive m. avium. a total of six psti profiles were found among  <dig> isolates: b ; g ; i ; k ; r ; and u . seventeen bsteii profiles were detected among  <dig> isolates: c <dig> ; c <dig> ; c <dig> ; c <dig> ; c <dig>  and single isolates with c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  s <dig>  i <dig> and i <dig>  ten different combined psti-bsteii profiles were recorded among the  <dig> isolates that were characterised with both enzymes: b-c <dig> ; b-c <dig> ; b-c <dig>  and single isolates of b-c <dig>  b-c <dig>  g-c <dig>  i-c <dig>  k-c <dig>  r-i <dig> and u-c <dig>  the b-c <dig> profile was predominant in scotland in this cohort of isolates, specifically in the regions of aberdeenshire, angus, borders and perth and kinross . the c <dig> profile was more widely spread across europe and was found in the czech republic, greece, finland, the netherlands, norway and spain, .

pfge typing
pfge typing data were obtained for  <dig> map isolates . twenty four different snabi profiles were detected in this panel of isolates:  <dig> ;  <dig> ;  <dig> ;  <dig> ;  <dig> ;  <dig> ;  <dig>  and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ; and  <dig> distinct spei profiles:  <dig> ;  <dig> ;  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ;  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> . the combination of both enzyme profiles gave  <dig> different multiplex profiles:  <cit>  ;  <cit>  ;  <cit>  ;  <cit> , <cit>  ;  <cit>  ;  <cit> , <cit> , <cit>   and  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit> , <cit>  . by far the most widely distributed pfge type was  <cit> , which was found in the czech republic, finland, the netherlands, norway, scotland and spain . pfge type  <cit>  was the next most common occurring in the czech republic, finland, the netherlands and spain . profile  <cit>  was found in the netherlands and scotland and the other profiles were found in only one country . the numbers of isolates detected with these profiles are too small to determine if these multiplex profiles truly are restricted in their geographical location.

aflp typing
a representative subset of  <dig> map isolates in the typing panel were analysed by aflp. the dna restriction patterns generated by ecori and msei showed patterns that met the conditions for analyses such as fragment sizes, number of bands and ratio of fully versus partially digested fragments. the map isolates, as a group, clearly clustered differently from other mycobacterial species such as mycobacterium marinum, mycobacterium tuberculosis and m. phlei. however, within the group of map isolates a low degree of genetic diversity was detected, with isolates displaying between  <dig> and 95% homology. the reproducibility of the technique was assessed and it was concluded that on average the calculated similarities using the pearson product-moment correlation between aflp typing repeats was  <dig> to 90%. since the variation detected between repeat analyses was in the same range as the genetic variation detected between map isolates it was concluded that aflp could not discriminate effectively between isolates and no further map isolates were typed using this procedure.

miru-vntr typing
one hundred and forty seven map isolates were typed by miru-vntr and  <dig> different types were obtained . in addition, miru-vntr types inmv  <dig> and  <dig> were obtained for the two is <dig> positive m. avium isolates. the following miru-vntr types were exhibited by map isolates in this study: inmv  <dig> ;  <dig> ;  <dig> ;  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ;  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> . inmv  <dig> and  <dig> were the most widely disseminated miru-vntr types, both occurring in the czech republic, finland, the netherlands, scotland and spain . inmv  <dig> also was found in norway and inmv  <dig> in greece . the relative frequencies of the various alleles were calculated and are shown in table  <dig>  the allelic diversity observed is consistent with the previous report  <cit> .

the allelic diversity  at a locus was calculated as h =  <dig> - Σxi <dig> , where xi is the frequency of the ith allele at the locus, and n the number of isolates  <cit> .

comparison of typing techniques
a predominance of one or two types was observed with all of the typing techniques and these predominant types could be further discriminated by one or both of the other typing methods . for example, the predominant pfge multiplex type  <cit>  comprising  <dig> isolates was subdivided into nine different profiles by miru-vntr and seven different profiles by bsteii is900-rflp. pfge multiplex type  <cit>  comprising  <dig> isolates could be subdivided into three inmv profiles and three bsteii is900-rflp patterns. minor multiplex profiles  <cit> ,  <cit>  and  <cit>   were each subdivided into two by miru-vntr. the major miru-vntr type inmv <dig> consisting of  <dig> isolates was split by pfge into  <dig> and by bsteii is900-rflp into four subtypes. inmv <dig> composed of  <dig> isolates was subdivided into eight and seven types by pfge and bsteii is900-rflp, respectively. the minor groups inmv  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were each subdivided by pfge into a further two types and inmv  <dig> into two bsteii types. both pfge and miru-vntr each differentiated the most widespread bsteii is900-rflp type c <dig>  which included  <dig> isolates, into  <dig> and  <dig> distinct types, respectively. the bsteii type c <dig> comprising  <dig> isolates was subdivided into four types by each of the other typing methods. the minor types c <dig> and c <dig> were further subdivided into three and two, respectively, by pfge and vntr-miru subdivided c <dig> into two types. by combining pfge and vntr-miru or all three typing techniques it was possible to discriminate  <dig> and  <dig> patterns, respectively .

 <dig>   <dig> map isolates were typed by is900-rflp, pfge and miru-vntr but not all isolates were typed by all three typing procedures.

distribution among different host species
map isolates from three domestic species of ruminants and  <dig> different wildlife species, a feral cat and a captive giraffe were typed . the wildlife encompassed both ruminant and non-ruminant species. among the wildlife species, feral cat and captive giraffe, a total of nine is900-rflp, nine pfge and six inmv types were detected.

in order to make a preliminary assessment of transmission dynamics, the combined typing data from all three molecular techniques was considered, as this was most discriminatory. a total of seven combined profiles were detected in isolates from more than one host species  . the evidence for interspecies transmission is more compelling if the same strain types are isolated from multiple species on the same property. even with the limited data available on the properties from which the isolates in the study were obtained, it was possible to show that two combined profiles  were found in more than one species on the same property in seven cases . of these, four properties included isolates from both livestock and wildlife . the properties cf, dr and i, are all located within the geographical area of perth and kinross and en, ge and r in the adjacent region of angus in scotland. isolates from species on all six of these properties had the same combined profile . profile  <cit> , inmv <dig>  c <dig> was obtained from a goat and a sheep on the same property in greece.

limited data was available for two properties in the czech republic, krh and vo. on these properties the combined typing profiles of the isolates showed that they were not the same in all the species sampled. the pfge multiplex profile  <cit>  was found on vo in isolates from both a cow and a hare but is900-rflp analysis showed the hare isolate to have a different profile to the cow. the two deer on property krh had a different profile to that of a cow on the same farm.

discussion
the results of this study improve our knowledge of the epidemiology of paratuberculosis in europe regarding the genetic diversity and distribution of map isolates with respect to geographic location and host species of origin. the study has also permitted a comprehensive comparison of three standardized typing procedures, the results of which will inform future epidemiological studies as to the most appropriate and discriminative methods to employ.

this is the first study to compare the discriminatory power of is900-rflp, pfge, aflp and miru-vntr for the molecular characterization of map isolates. aflp could not effectively discriminate between map isolates and therefore is not suitable for epidemiological studies on paratuberculosis. a major problem with the technique was reproducibility. this was probably due in part to the variable quality of the mycobacterial dna, which is highly dependent on growth phase and difficult to extract from map isolates that are particularly resilient to lysis. reproducibility could also have been affected by small variations in the experimental procedure such as shifts in electrophoretic mobility during capillary electrophoresis. despite several attempts using alternative analytical procedures, no decrease in this variation could be obtained.

the most widely used measure of diversity is simpson's index of diversity , which we have employed here to estimate the discriminatory power of the various molecular typing techniques utilised in this study. when all map isolates were considered irrespective of host or geographic origin, the sid was not significantly different between each of the individual typing techniques  and was low at a value between  <dig>  and  <dig>  in accordance with previous reports  <cit> . the sid value is strongly influenced by the distribution of types rather than the number of types detected. this is clearly demonstrated by comparing the two methods with the largest difference in the number of patterns detected i.e. is900-rflp, which identified  <dig> profiles and multiplex pfge, which detected  <dig> profiles. despite the number of profiles detected, both methods have almost the same sid point estimate and 95% confidence interval. the sid for is900-rflp could have been improved further had it been possible to obtain psti profiles for the isolates. the discriminatory power of the individual techniques is too low for epidemiological surveys since a sid of around  <dig>  is generally considered the minimum. for isolates from mainland europe, sid for the combination of multiplex pfge and miru-vntr, with or without is900-rflp, exceeded the threshold value of  <dig> . the increase in sid is not surprising since the different typing techniques target different sources of genetic variation and have different limitations and will therefore complement each other when used in combination. due to limited heterogeneity among scottish isolates, combining all three typing techniques increased sid to  <dig>  for the dataset as a whole, providing discriminatory power close to the minimum but not quite reaching the target value.

although the combination of all three typing techniques gives the greatest discrimination, this is generally not practical or cost effective for large national or international studies and often a compromise is sought. the choice of typing method will be influenced by the predominant isolate type in the population to be tested. this is highlighted in this study by considering the data shown in table  <dig> for the isolates from scotland versus those from mainland europe and the combined european dataset . the isolates from scotland comprise a homogeneous population in which the b-c <dig> is900-rflp profile predominates and is therefore a rigorous test for the combination approach. comparing the sids for the various combinations of typing techniques there was no difference between multiplex pfge + miru-vntr and the combination of all three typing techniques. therefore, a combination of multiplex pfge + miru-vntr would be suitable for epidemiological studies in scotland. a combination of multiplex pfge + miru-vntr would also be appropriate for mainland europe but here a combination of is900-rflp and multiplex pfge would also perform well. the best combination for the combined european dataset was all three typing techniques. the sid for the isolates from mainland europe was often higher than that for the combined european dataset, the latter being affected by the inclusion of the less heterogeneous scottish isolates. based on these results a small pilot study of the population of interest is recommended before undertaking a large epidemiological survey. for further epidemiological studies in scotland, it would be advantageous to undertake a pilot study including short sequence repeat analysis  <cit> , which may improve the discriminatory power for this homogeneous population of isolates.

the study identified the common isolate types within the european countries examined. is900-rflp profile c <dig> was the most widespread, consistent with previous reports from individual countries  <cit> . this profile has a global distribution, being found in the united states, australia and new zealand  <cit> . although is900-rflp profile c <dig> is commonly isolated in scotland it is reported to be relatively rare in other european countries  <cit> . it was identified in isolates from the netherlands and norway in this study and has been reported previously in germany  <cit>  and is predominant in specific regions of argentina  <cit> . the most common pfge profile was  <cit>  found in six of the seven countries examined, closely followed by  <cit>  found in four. invm  <dig> was found in six countries and invm  <dig> in five. further investigations will be required to determine if this distribution is a consequence of animal movements, increased virulence or whether these isolates have characteristics that allow them to transmit more readily. there is evidence to suggest that different mycobacterial strain types vary in their ability to cause disease. caws et al.  <cit>  provided evidence that m. tuberculosis genotype influences clinical disease phenotype and demonstrated a significant interaction between host and bacterial genotypes and the development of tuberculosis. gollnick et al.  <cit>  reported that the survival of map in bovine monocyte-derived macrophages was not affected by host infection status but by the infecting strain type. two recent studies suggest that different map strain types may play a role in polarizing the host immune responses during infection  <cit> . also, different map strains have been found to differ in virulence in experimental infections of deer  <cit>  and in a mouse model  and verna et al. have provided data to show how the strain type may influence the pathology of ovine paratuberculosis  <cit> .

surprisingly, no type i strains  were identified within the  <dig> sheep and  <dig> goat field isolates submitted by the partners. this may be a reflection of the difficulties encountered in isolating and growing these strains in vitro. typically, isolates of strain type i are slow-growing, taking longer than  <dig> weeks and sometimes as long as  <dig> months to isolate on solid medium. cultures are often not retained this long in diagnostic laboratories. furthermore, studies have shown that the decontamination procedures or media used for isolation can significantly affect recovery of these strains. reddacliff et al.  <cit>  reported the detrimental effects of various decontamination protocols on the recovery of type i strains from tissues and faeces. the addition of egg yolk and mycobactin j to bactec 12b or 7h <dig> broth was found to be essential for the isolation of australian sheep strains from faeces and to enhance their recovery from tissue samples  <cit> . other workers have successfully isolated type i or iii strains on lj or middlebrook 7h <dig> supplemented with mycobactin j  <cit> . the addition of antibiotics can also affect growth. both ampicillin and vancomycin hydrochloride can retard growth of type i strains  <cit> . the various laboratories participating in this study used a range of decontamination procedures and culture media but it is not possible to rule out a culture bias.

the results of this survey highlight an interesting difference between the epidemiology of map in europe and australia. this study shows that in europe, type ii strains  are commonly isolated from sheep, goats and cattle whereas in australia, type ii strains are rarely, if ever, isolated from sheep -the predominant type being type i. we can only speculate as to the reasons for this difference. management practices will affect the circulation of strains and can differ between some parts of europe and australia. the scale of farming operations and relative proportions of the different livestock co- or sequentially grazing may also be a factor. paratuberculosis is more common in sheep in australia than in cattle and the type i strain is more virulent for sheep than cattle  <cit> .

in this study, map was isolated from  <dig> different host species, which included both ruminants and non-ruminants. this is the first report of the isolation of map from a giraffe. the type ii strains appear to have greater propensity for infecting a broad range of host species whereas the epidemiological data available for type i strains suggests that they have a preference for sheep and goats  <cit> . since our results show that the same profiles are found in isolates from different species, it strongly suggests that strain sharing occurs. even more convincing was the observation that the same profiles were isolated from wildlife species and domestic ruminants on the same farm. the frequency or ease with which interspecies transmission occurs are unknown entities and require further investigation. similarly, the relative risk of transmission from domestic livestock to wildlife or vice versa remains to be determined.

all animals in contact with map contaminated faeces on an infected property will contribute to the spread of disease through passive transmission. however, map infects a variety of wildlife host species that potentially could be reservoirs for infection of domestic livestock and have serious implications for control of paratuberculosis. the role of wildlife reservoirs in the epidemiology of paratuberculosis will depend on a number of factors which need to be taken into consideration when undertaking a risk assessment for interspecies transmission. although map can infect many wildlife species, only wild ruminants and lagomorphs show evidence of disease as determined by the presence of gross or microscopic lesions with associated acid fast bacteria  <cit> . these wildlife species have the capacity to excrete map and spread disease to other susceptible species primarily through further faecal contamination of the environment. potentially, they could constitute wildlife reservoirs. by definition, to constitute a wildlife reservoir the infection would need to be sustained within the species population. evidence is available for vertical, pseudovertical and horizontal transmission within natural rabbit populations which could contribute to the maintenance of map infections within such populations  <cit> .

the other wildlife species in this study could be categorised into predators and scavengers that probably acquire the disease through eating contaminated prey or carrion, respectively. it has been reported previously that these animals show no clinical signs of disease and only minor histopathological changes with a few acid fast bacteria in tissues  <cit> . such infected predators and scavengers are probably 'dead-end hosts' and are not high risk factors for interspecies transmission.

information pertaining to strain types can assist in designing and evaluating disease control programmes. it is beneficial to know the predominant strain type in a population or the virulence of a particular strain type particularly for developing new vaccines. singh et al.  <cit>  recently reported the effectiveness and advantage of using a vaccine based on a local 'bison-type' strain.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this survey has helped to expand our knowledge to improve our understanding of the epidemiology of paratuberculosis. it is hoped that the information provided will facilitate future surveys and research strategies to resolve the outstanding epidemiological questions regarding this disease.

the results of this study were in agreement with previous reports indicating that map isolates comprise a relatively homogeneous population exhibiting little genetic diversity compared with other bacterial pathogens. as a result it is necessary to use multiple genotyping techniques targeting different sources of genetic variation to obtain the level of discrimination necessary to investigate transmission dynamics and trace the source of infections. identical genotypes were obtained from map isolated from different host species co-habiting on the same property strongly suggesting that interspecies transmission occurs. interspecies transmission of map between wildlife species and domestic livestock on the same farm provides further evidence to support a role for wildlife reservoirs of infection. however, in assessing the relative risk of transmission between wildlife and domestic livestock, distinction needs to be made between passive and active transmission as well as the potential for contact.
