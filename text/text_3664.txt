BACKGROUND
a. baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen mainly involved in healthcare-associated infections, with increased mortality and morbidity  <cit> . the serious concern associated with this bacterium is the increasing prevalence of multidrug resistant isolates, especially carbapenem resistant ones  <cit> . therefore, management of infections due to a. baumannii has become a real public health issue in many countries  <cit> . in a recent sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, the percentage of a. baumannii isolates susceptible to meropenem decreased noticeably from  <dig>  % in  <dig> to  <dig>  % in  <dig> in european intensive care units  <cit> . the main mechanism of resistance to carbapenems is the production of oxacillinases encoded mostly by blaoxa-23-like, blaoxa-24-like, blaoxa-58-like and recently blaoxa-143-like and blaoxa-235-like . to a lesser degree, carbapenemases from classes a and b have also been involved  <cit> . new delhi metallo-ß-lactamase  <dig> , a recent described metallo-ß-lactamase, has emerged in enterobacteriaceae as well as in acinetobacter  <cit> . generally, a limited number of clones are responsible for worldwide outbreaks, and international clones i and ii are the most common ones  <cit> . in order to identify and track these clones during hospital outbreaks, numerous molecular typing methods have been proposed such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis , amplified fragment length polymorphism , repetitive-sequence-based pcr , and multilocus sequence typing   . currently, mlst is the gold standard typing tool for population structure and macro-epidemiological investigations based on sequencing of internal fragments of  <dig> genes  <cit> . two mlst schemes have been developed for acinetobacter baumannii : pasteur and bartual schemes  <cit> . overall, the  <dig> schemes are concordant  <cit> . however, because of recombination bias observed on some loci in bartual’s mlst   <cit> , pasteur’s mlst has been chosen for this study. recently, blaoxa-51-like sequence-based typing , a simple typing method based on sequencing of the full length of blaoxa-51-like gene has been proposed as it has shown a similar discriminatory power than rep-pcr, and mlst .

in lebanon, limited numbers of epidemiological studies concerning a. baumannii have been reported, almost in beyrouth . in a previous study, we have described the dominance of international clone ii within a set of  <dig> isolates collected from beyrouth and north lebanon between 2009– <dig>  <cit> . in another study, we reported the first detection of four ndm- <dig> producing isolates isolated in tripoli-northern lebanon from syrian patients injured during syrian war  <cit> . the aim of this study was to characterise a. baumannii molecular epidemiology in tripoli-lebanon between 2011– <dig> using blaoxa-51-like and pasteur’s mlst typing and to determine the carbapenem resistance mechanisms.

RESULTS
bacterial isolates and identification
a total of  <dig> non-duplicate isolates were obtained between  <dig> and  <dig> from seven medical institutions in tripoli:  <dig> isolates from tripoli governmental hospital,  <dig> from nini hospital, four from dar al chiffaa hospital, two from monla, one isolate from each hanane and haykal hospitals and one from the private laboratory. among those isolates,  <dig> had been obtained from syrian refugees and  <dig> from lebanese patients. they were all confirmed as a. baumannii by blaoxa- <dig> real time pcr and rpob gene sequencing. these isolates were recovered from respiratory specimens ; wound ; urine ; catheter tips , blood  and other locations . for one isolate, no information was available. ninety patients were male and  <dig> female. ages were between 1 month and 89 years with a mean of 40 years.

antibiotic susceptibility and carbapenem resistance mechanisms
most of the isolates exhibited multidrug-resistant phenotypes. overall,  <dig> isolates were carbapenem resistant and among them,  <dig> carried the blaoxa- <dig> gene while  <dig> isolates carried the blandm- <dig> gene. isaba <dig> was found in  <dig> isolates. the presence of isaba1/blaoxa- <dig> association was confirmed in all oxa- <dig> producing isolates. the isaba1/blaoxa- <dig> association was not detected. among carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii,  <dig> had been isolated from syrian refugees and  <dig> from lebanese patients. the prevalence of carbapenem resistance was significantly higher among a. baumannii isolated from syrian refugees .

epidemiological typing
the blaoxa-51-like sbt revealed the presence of  <dig> different nucleotide variants. of the  <dig> isolates, blaoxa- <dig> variant was the most prevalent and found in  <dig> isolates, followed by blaoxa- <dig> , blaoxa- <dig> , blaoxa- <dig>  and blaoxa- <dig> . other variants, blaoxa- <dig>  blaoxa- <dig>  blaoxa- <dig>  blaoxa- <dig>  blaoxa- <dig>  blaoxa- <dig>  kf <dig>  kj <dig>  and akas <dig> were present sporadically in our collection. blaoxa- <dig> variant encoded a new protein  described for the first time in this study which differed from oxa- <dig> protein by a single amino acid at position  <dig> .

mlst was performed on a set of  <dig> randomly selected a. baumannii isolates representing all blaoxa- <dig> variants. a total of  <dig> st, including  <dig> new st, were identified . eburst analysis showed that  <dig> of the  <dig> st were clustered into  <dig> ccs which were cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig>  additionally, st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig> were single locus variants of st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> respectively, and st <dig> and st <dig> were singletons.table  <dig> characteristics of the acinetobacter baumannii isolates studied

comparison between mlst and blaoxa-51-like sbt showed that isolates belonging to the same clonal complex carried all the same blaoxa- <dig> variant. besides, each of the remaining lineages  that were identified had additionally a specific blaoxa-51-like variant .

discussion
our study provided a global view of molecular epidemiology of a. baumannii isolates from hospitals in tripoli, lebanon. tripoli is a city that hosts a large number of refugees and wounded syrians, which may explain the high number of wound specimens in our collection. although, a. baumannii is an opportunistic nosocomial pathogen, it is increasingly reported from infections occurring outside hospitals, particularly skin and soft-tissue infections and pneumonia  <cit> . a. baumannii has also been a well-documented pathogen associated with wound infections in usa troops from the iraq and afghanistan wars  <cit> . the typology of these situations raised questions about their origins and the potential involvement of an environmental reservoir  <cit> . the origin of infections from syrian patients was ambiguous. although it was likely that nosocomial infections occurred, a number of infections were present at the time of admission of the patients in lebanese hospitals  <cit> . these infections may have been acquired from environmental sources at the time of injury, during the patient stay in syrian hospitals, or during a direct evacuation from the theatre of operations to lebanon. unfortunately, data concerning the date of injury, the length of hospitalisation, and the conditions of care and treatment in syrian hospitals are lacking.

approximately 60 % of our isolates showed a carbapenem resistance phenotype. the production of oxa- <dig> was the major carbapenem resistance mechanism, with an upstream insertion of isaba <dig>  thus supporting international data about the worldwide emergence of this carbapenemase . alarmingly,  <dig> ndm- <dig> producing isolates have been detected from  <dig> syrian patients  <cit>  and one from a lebanese patient.

blaoxa-51-like is an intrinsic oxacillinase gene naturally occurring in a. baumannii, and more than  <dig> variants have been identified to date  <cit> . however, the occasional detection of blaoxa- <dig> in acinetobacter nosocomialis and acinetobacter genomic species “close to 13tu” limit its use as a single identification method. therefore, it is always combined with others techniques  <cit> . genetic diversity of blaoxa- <dig> gene has been explored and found to be very interesting for identifying epidemic clones  <cit> . thus, the full gene sequencing has been proposed as a single typing method for a. baumannii. as being simple and rapid, we have initially screened here the epidemiological belonging of our isolates to the previous identified clonal lineages by blaoxa-51-like sbt. we have then randomly selected isolates from each of the representative blaoxa-51-like sequences for mlst analysis. in our study, blaoxa-51-like gene sequencing correctly assigned all isolates to their corresponding clonal complexes. here, the blaoxa- <dig> gene variant, which is associated with st <dig>   <cit> , was predominant and found in  <dig> % of the a. baumannii isolates. the isolates carrying the blaoxa- <dig> gene variant have been identified in samples obtained from the different hospitals in tripoli. these findings are consistent with those observed worldwide since cc <dig> was reported in more than  <dig> countries in europe, asia, africa, australia, usa, and south america  <cit> . eighty percent of our carbapenem resistant isolates belonged to this clone and oxa- <dig> was the only carbapenem resistance mechanism found. the high level of antimicrobial resistance may represent one of the main causes for its propensity and its successful predominance in hospitals throughout the world  <cit> . the blaoxa- <dig> gene variant was the second gene mostly found in our collection. this gene was commonly associated with st <dig>  but interestingly, we found two blaoxa- <dig> isolates belonging to the new sequence type st <dig> . both isolates were isolated from wounded syrian patients. the blaoxa- <dig> was another blaoxa-51-like gene variant found in our study, it was associated with clonal complex cc <dig> . cc <dig> is currently formed by st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  and st <dig>  in our study blaoxa-51-like sbt revealed the same sequence blaoxa- <dig> variant in the two identified sequences st <dig> and st <dig>  we have recently detected st <dig> in chicken and we found blaoxa-  <dig> as a blaoxa- <dig> variant  <cit> . our  <dig> ndm- <dig> producing syrian isolates belonged to st <dig>  indeed, this st has also been responsible for an outbreak in france. it is usually imported from north africa  <cit>  and seems to be an emerging clone.

blaoxa- <dig> is a blaoxa-51-like variant associated with cc <dig>  <cit> . st <dig>  was also an emerging clone reported in europe, asia, africa and usa  <cit> , and from pets in reunion island, a french territory located in western indian ocean  <cit> .

different carbapenemases have been identified in this clone, as oxa- <dig>  oxa- <dig> and oxa- <dig>  <cit> . otherwise, ndm- <dig> producing st <dig> was also detected in germany and kenya . within our four identified isolates belonging to st <dig>  one isolate was a ndm- <dig> producing isolate recovered from a urine sample of an 80-year-old lebanese patient suffering from amyloidosis and anaemia at nini hospital, tripoli, lebanon. finally, compared to carbapenem resistant isolates belonging to successful emerging clones, most of susceptible isolates were very diverse, belonging to different sequence types .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study highlights the emergence of ndm- <dig> and oxa- <dig> carbapenemases in tripoli, lebanon and the urgent need of effective measures to control the spread of a. baumannii in this country. it is noteworthy that tripoli is located near the syrian border and the microbial epidemiology is probably highly impacted by wounded syrian refugees who can represent a reservoir of multidrug-resistant bacteria in hospitals. the higher prevalence of carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii among isolates from syrian refugees was consistent with this hypothesis. besides, we showed that blaoxa-51-like sbt is a reliable and fast method able to assign our isolates to their clonal complexes. other multicentre studies are required to investigate the situation in other lebanese cities that are possibly less concerned by the afflux of syrian refugees fleeing war.
