BACKGROUND
the seven-transmembrane spanning g protein-coupled receptors  represent a major group of cell-surface detectors and constitute  <dig>  % of the genome in vertebrates  <cit> . they play a key role in the physiology of multicellular organisms as they transduce a broad variety of extracellular signals into the cell. of the  <dig> genes thought to encode gpcrs in humans, about 300– <dig> mediate effects by endogeneous ligands, with the remainder being sensory receptors. gpcrs can be grouped into six families based on the sequence similarity of their common heptahelical domain . four of the families are present in dictyostelium discoideum.

d. discoideum, a soil-living amoeba feeds on bacteria in decaying vegetation and reproduces by binary fission. growing amoebae chemotax toward folic acid and other nutrients, whereas starved cells aggregate by chemotaxis toward camp. camp is sensed by camp-receptors, which form an unusual family of gpcrs  <cit> . signalling via cars is mediated by gα <dig>  one of the  <dig> gα proteins of d. discoideum, however, many camp responses are also independent of g proteins  <cit> . several other signaling molecules such as cell density factors, folate and related pterins, lpa , psf , cf , small metabolites and numerous small peptides are known to be acting via gpcrs as well  <cit> . their receptors have not been identified so far.

the family  <dig>  of gpcrs contains receptors for a wide range of signals: for the main neurotransmitters glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid, for ca2+, for sweet and amino acid taste compounds, for pheromones and for odorants. accordingly they fall into six groups, the metabotropic glutamate receptors, the ca2+-sensing receptors, the γ-aminobutyric acidb receptors, the pheromone receptors, the sweet and amino acid receptors and the orphan family  <dig> receptors. they possess a seven transmembrane domain  responsible for g-protein activation, and a large extracellular domain responsible for ligand binding. this domain is similar to bacterial periplasmic proteins that are involved in the transport of small molecules, and is called venus flytrap module . the metabotropic gabab/glutamate like receptor family was considered animal-specific and was not found outside the metazoan branch until the dictyostelium genome was sequenced  <cit> . altogether,  <dig> genes encoding gabab like receptors were identified based on the homology of the hd. they are named grla through grlr  proteins .

in the present study we undertook an investigation of grlj, located on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . grlj is expressed throughout growth and development with a strong increase in development. it has a crucial role at several stages of development leading to precocious development, the formation of longer slugs that break apart several times while migrating and to the production of spores that have an abnormal morphology and exhibit reduced viability.

RESULTS
dictyostelium family  <dig> of gpcrs
the dictyostelium genome possesses  <dig> genes encoding receptors belonging to the family  <dig> of gpcrs and all of them resemble gabab or metabotropic glutamate like-receptors  <cit> . they are represented as grl  proteins. grl encoding genes are present on all chromosomes. some of them such as grla, b and o are close together. their molecular masses range from  <dig>  for grll to  <dig>  for grlr. however most of them have masses below  <dig>  and only grlp, q and r are significantly larger. the increase in mass is mainly due to an extended n-terminal region. most of them have a signalpeptide and a bmp  domain in their amino terminal region, a domain which was first found in outer membrane proteins of bacteria, and which is similar to the vftm that forms the ligand binding site in the n-termini of metabotropic gpcrs  <cit> . exceptions are grle, n, p, q and r . the n-terminal region of grle has homology to the mouse and the dorsophila glutamate receptor and was identified as a true gaba receptor in d. discoideum  <cit> . grlp, q and r have a region of homology with chlamydia polymorphic membrane protein in their amino terminal sequences.

1grln habors an additional predicted transmembrane domain in its n-terminal region.2grlp, q and r have long n-termini which have a region of homology with chlamydia polymorphic membrane protein.

in a phylogenetic tree that was constructed using the full length sequences of all grl receptors three major clusters were formed, consisting of grla, b, f, j in one group, grlp, q, r forming the second and grlc, d, g, h, k and m forming the third and largest one. four of the grls  diverted out separately . when analysing the transcript levels of all grls throughout the developmental stages by semiquantitative rt-pcr analysis we detected the transcripts for all genes at all times. we found increased levels from early aggregation  or the tight aggregation stage onward , when the contact site a is expressed. the levels stayed high during late development and transcripts were clearly present at t <dig> when fruiting body formation is close to completion. grla transcripts were still quite abundant at this stage . additionally we quantified the mrna amounts for grlj using the actin mrna for comparison. we found that the grlj message is of very low abundance throughout development ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  pg, whereas for actin we obtained amounts between  <dig> and  <dig> pg in these samples .

a summary of results from rt-pcr is shown. respective grls are indicated in the left column and hours of development in the top row. key: +++: strong band; ++: clear band; +: weak band; +/-: hardly detectable; -: no expression detected. the measurements were done in a qualitative rt-pcr as described in methods.

rna was isolated from various developmental stages . 1the relative levels of grlj during development were determined assuming that the level of the actin message is constant throughout development. the level of grlj at the  <dig> hour time point was arbitrarily set to  <dig> 

grlj is a  <dig> amino acid containing protein possessing a typical signal sequence for secretion followed by a bmp  domain and a seven transmembrane domain. the fold of the bmp domain is similar to the fold of the bacterial periplasmic binding proteins  which function in scavenging or sensing nutrients in the environment  <cit> . sequences coding for pbp domains can occur in combination with diverse sequences coding for integral membrane domains. in  <dig> transmembrane receptors they act as the extracellular ligand binding site such as in the glutamate/glycine gated channels, metabotropic glutamate/gabab, ca2+sensing, pheromone and atrial natriuretic peptide-receptors  <cit> .

while the full length sequence of grlj appears closer to gabab receptors than other characterised members of the family  <dig>  a detailed analysis revealed that the similarity was pertaining specifically to the transmembrane regions . grlj clustered more closely to the gababr <dig> subtypes in a phylogentic analysis that was performed with only the transmembrane domains .  <dig> members of the dictyostelium family  <dig> gpcrs share this domain organisation with grlj. grln, p, q and r are different .

subcellular localisation of grlj
the subcellular localisation of grlj was studied by expressing a full-length grlj-gfp fusion protein. the expression of the fusion protein was under control of the actin <dig> promoter which is a strong promoter and will lead to an overexpression. grlj-gfp was present at the plasma membrane, the majority of the protein was however found on internal structures. at the plasma membrane grlj-gfp overlapped to a good extent with annexin c <dig>  a protein present at the plasma membrane and at internal membranes  <cit> . in the cell there was partial colocalisation with interaptin, a protein found at the nuclear envelope and the er  <cit>  . we also monitored for colocalisation of grlj-gfp with antibodies against vata, which is present on endosomal membranes and the contractile vacuole of d. discoideum   <cit> , lysosomal antigen   <cit> ], and vacuolin  <cit> , a protein on post lysosomal vacuoles. however, we did not note colocalisation with any of these proteins . the presence of grlj-gfp on er- and golgi-membranes may may reflect the transport pathway of the protein towards the plasma membrane. an analysis of the grlj-gfp localisation during development  did not indicate changes in its subcellular distribution . western blot analysis of subcellular fractions of grlj-gfp expressing cells supported a membrane association as grlj-gfp was exclusively present in the  <dig>  g pellet like the golgi component comitin .

grlj gene disruption and mutant behaviour
to gain insight into the in vivo functions of grlj, mutants carrying a disruption of the grlj gene were generated . growth of grlj- was not affected and the mutant reached slightly higher cell densities when grown in suspension culture in axenic medium as compared to the wild type a× <dig> . on a lawn of klebsiella aerogenes growth was comparable. cytokinesis and cell size were unaltered in the mutant as well.

as grlj is expressed throughout the development with a induction of the expression at later developmental stages we studied whether its loss affects development of the mutant. starvation was carried out on phosphate agar plates. grlj- cells aggregated well and formed mounds similar to the wild type cells but exhibited an accelerated development after the aggregation stage and slugs were formed at  <dig> h, culminated at  <dig> h and formed relatively smaller fruiting bodies within  <dig> to  <dig> h . the expression pattern of cell-type specific developmental markers confirmed these observations. the pattern of transcription for the early aggregation specific genes car <dig> and acaa was similar in wild type and mutant. there was however an accelerated expression of the prestalk specific gene ecmb and another prestalk specific gene, carb , whereas the levels of ecma and the prespore specific pspa transcripts were timely . the different regulation of prestalk specific genes may be explained by the findings that they are regulated by different transcription factors  <cit> . we also tested aggregation in monolayer and observed timely formation of aggregation centres with thick streams for grlj- comparable to the wild type cells . expression of grlj-gfp in the mutant led to normal progression during development .

the chemotactic response to folate in d. discoideum requires g-proteins and is expected to be mediated by a yet unidentified gpcr. when we tested grlj null cells they responded normally to folate both during growth and development.

premature expression of adhesion proteins in grlj-
dictyostelium multicellularity is maintained by expression of several cell adhesion systems. during the initiation of development, ddcad- <dig> , a small, secreted glycoprotein, mediates edta-sensitive cell-cell adhesion  <cit> . at the onset of aggregation, expression of contact sites a /gp <dig> leads to edta-resistant cell-cell adhesion  <cit> , and gp150/lagc mediates edta-resistant cell-cell adhesion in the post-aggregation stages  <cit> . the temporal regulation of expression was not altered in the grlj- strain. ddcad- <dig> was expressed throughout the developmental timecourse followed by csa at the onset of starvation and lagc. for csa and lagc we noticed however comparatively higher levels at the onset of aggregation  . these observations may be explained by data from csa mutant analysis that suggested that the expression of one cell adhesion molecule is coupled to the transcriptional control of another  <cit> . the time point of early aggregation was not noticeably altered in grlj-.

post-aggregation events in grlj-
during post-aggregative development d. discoideum cells undergo characteristic changes and differentiate into different cell types which sort to specific regions in the multicellular organism. we also generated a× <dig> and grlj - strains carrying plasmids that allowed the expression of the β-galactosidase gene under the control of the ecmo and pspa promoter  to study pattern formation during development. the ecmo promoter is active in a subpopulation of the prestalk cells, pspa is a well characterised prespore specific marker  <cit> . we did not note significant differences in the staining pattern of the β-galactosidase driven by either promoter between the mutant and wild-type strains pointing at the defect in the timing of the expression of the developmental markers but not in pattern formation .

grlj- forms longer slugs that break apart during migration
dictyostelium slugs migrate until they find a favourable condition to culminate. the prestalk cells are comparatively more motile than the prespore cells and they form the tip of the slug acting as a signalling centre and organiser  <cit> . a very high level of interaction and coordination occurs between the two cell types in the migrating slugs and they have to make a coordinated decision about the right time to stop migration and start culmination  <cit> . the grlj- strain produced slightly longer slugs , which could sense light and phototax. however, they did not migrate as far as wild type slugs and migrated with a wider angle towards the light  in comparison to the wild type . furthermore, we observed the breaking up of slugs in the grlj- strain, which is clearly viewed in the enlarged version indicated by the arrows pointing towards the breaks just in the path of one migrating slug . this pattern was observed for most of the slugs traced. we applied live cell microscopy wherein we captured time-lapse images of the grlj- development and compared it with the wild-type development . the slugs indeed broke several times on their way while migrating.

defective sporulation in grlj-
sporulation is a tightly controlled process that involves cell-type differentiation with morphogenesis wherein the prespore cells appear early in development and progressively accumulate components of the spore coat in prespore vesicles which are secreted to assemble the spore coat during encapsulation  <cit> . most of the strains that complete development faster produce abnormal spores with reduced viability  <cit> . because lack of grlj resulted in precocious development following mound formation we studied the spore morphology by staining spores with calcofluor, a fluorescent compound that selectively binds to cellulose present in the spore coat. a× <dig> cells produced well-elongated slightly banana-shaped spores, whereas 35–40% of grlj- spores were round or misshaped. the abnormality in the spore morphology was complemented by the expression of grlj-gfp in the mutant .

the spore viability in the mutants was analysed and compared with a× <dig> wild type by plating equal amounts of axenically growing cells on phosphate agar plates and allowing them to develop for  <dig> hours until spore formation was complete. spores were harvested and counted to determine the number of spores produced in comparison to the initial number of cells plated. additionally detergent resistance was checked. the wild type cells showed recovery of  <dig> % spores from the cells initially plated and they were all viable and resistant to detergent treatment. grlj - also produced spores comparable to the wild type spores  per cells originally plated. however, fewer spores were viable in grlj -  and they were comparatively more sensitive to detergent treatment. this defect in the viability could be rescued by expressing grlj-gfp in grlj - cells .

equal numbers  of cells were plated onto phosphate agar plates and allowed to develop completely until  <dig> hours. the spores were then harvested and counted.  <dig> spores per each strain were plated in association with k. aerogenes with and without treatment with  <dig> % triton-x- <dig> for  <dig> min. the percentage of plaques obtained with/without detergent and the percentage of spores harvested from the mutants was calculated setting the spores harvested from wild type cells as  <dig> percent. the result shown is from a representative experiment.

spore formation is controlled by two peptides, spore differentiation factor  <dig> and  <dig> . sdf- <dig> accumulates during the slug stage and is released in a single burst at the onset of culmination, whereas sdf- <dig> is released at the mid-culmination stage also in a single burst  <cit> . we assayed for the production of sdf- <dig> and sdf- <dig> in grlj- and found that it not only produced comparable levels of both factors but also responded to these factors by inducing sporulation as in wild type . sdf- <dig> is homologous to the human diazepam binding inhibitor  neuropeptides  <cit> , which can bind to gabab receptors. gaba and glutamate were recently reported to be involved in the regulation of spore formation as inducer and inhibitor, respectively  <cit> . both molecules seem to act through grle, another member of the family  <dig> of gpcrs, leading to the induction or inhibition of sdf- <dig> formation. some gpcrs of the family  <dig> form homodimers while others form obligatory heterodimers. the response to gaba and glutamate of grlj null cells was therefore tested in a spore formation assay . grlj - responded to both gaba and glutamate like the wild type cells ruling out the possibility of being a receptor for either signals and of forming obligatory heterodimers with grle.

culminants of each strain were harvested and dissociated in  <dig> ml camp buffer, washed once and counted.  <dig> cells were plated in  <dig> well plates in the presence of the indicated factors. the proportion of spores was determined under the microscope  <dig> h after induction and quantified as fold induction in comparison to uninduced cells. * either a× <dig> or a×4: a× <dig> was initially used for induction by sdf- <dig> or sdf- <dig>  <cit> . a× <dig> is used for all factors and responds like a× <dig> to sdf- <dig> and sdf- <dig> 

discussion
the dictyostelium repertoire of seven transmembrane receptors has been discussed repeatedly  <cit> . here we have focused specifically on the family  <dig> and carried out additional analysis using all currently available data which allowed a much more detailed description of the proteins than had been possible before . our further studies were concerned with grlj.

lack of grlj alters the developmental pattern from the post-aggregation stages onwards. the grlj- strain aggregates well and forms mounds at a fairly comparable time as the wild type cells. there is a boost in the development thereon and the grlj- strain forms mature fruiting bodies before 18– <dig> h of starvation. the precocious development was reflected at the protein and mrna level of post-aggregative genes. previous studies have found that the expression of post-aggregation genes is directly controlled by the g-box binding factor gbf  <cit> . the increase in the expression level of the cell adhesion molecule lagc in the absence of grlj suggests that grlj normally acts as a negative regulator of development possibly through down regulation of gbf activity. precocious development has been noted in a variety of d. discoideum mutants. many of them are affected in the camp metabolism  <cit> , others like dmta, dima and dimb code for components of the dif signaling pathway  <cit> , or are directly involved in spore formation  <cit> .

several precociously developing strains such as rega- or rdea- are sporogenous and end up forming spores with abnormal morphology  <cit> . the rdea null strain forms round spores but only when the vegetative cells were grown in the presence of glucose as carbon source  <cit> . in general, precocious sporulation is mediated by an increase in the intracellular camp levels or occurs in strains with an increased pka activity  <cit> . grlj- produced similar numbers of spores as a× <dig> wild type, they were however less viable both with and without treatment with detergent pointing to an inefficient maturation. the grlj- cells produced also comparable amounts of the spore differentiation factors sdf- <dig> and sdf- <dig> at different culminating stages and were also able to induce sporulation in response to these factors. likewise, sporulation in grlj- in response to gaba and glutamate was unaltered.

our current understanding of grlj suggests a role in events pertaining to post-aggregation development in dictyostelium as a negative regulator of development. grlj is not involved in gaba, glutamate or folate mediated signalling. however, there are many unexplored molecules and secreted factors that are known to act via gpcrs and any amongst them may be a putative ligand for the receptor under investigation or other yet unexplored gpcrs. such compounds isolated from dictyostelium are for instance the acylated amino sugar derivatives furanodictine a and b possessing neuronal differentiation activity in rat pc- <dig> cells  <cit> . other interesting candidates are the acyl alpha pyronoids having inhibitory effects on the development of dictyostelium  <cit> . however not much is known about the mechanisms involved therein, but grlj can be a putative candidate receptor for any one of these compounds as the loss of grlj prevents a regulatory mechanism which is normally occuring and ensuring the correct developmental timing of morphogenetic events. in this respect grlj seems to resemble its mammalian counterparts of metabotropic gpcrs which are involved in inhibitory signaling in the brain.

CONCLUSIONS
grlj is a seven transmembrane protein belonging to the family <dig> of gpcrs, that contains the gabab/glutamate like receptor family. in the brain gaba  is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter and signals through ionotropic and metabotropic receptor systems at its n-terminus it carries a bmp-domain which is characteristic for most of the members of this family and is also found in the mammalian homologs. grlj transcripts are present throughout dictyostelium development, gfp-tagged grlj localises to the plasma membranes and to internal membranes in the perinuclear area which partially overlap with er membranes. grlj deficient cells showed a precocious development indicative of an inhibitory role of grlj during this stage of development. alterations were also observed during later development and resulted in defective slug formation and altered spore viabilty. we propose that grlj is an important regulator of dictyostelium development.
