BACKGROUND
akabane virus is classified into the genus orthobunyavirus in the family bunyaviridae. it is widely distributed from the tropical to temperate zones of the world and has been associated with hematophagous arthropod vectors such as culicoides biting midges and mosquitoes, and with ruminants  <cit> . akabane virus causes epizootic and sporadic outbreaks of abortions, stillbirths, premature births and congenital malformations characterized by arthrogryposis-hydranencephaly syndrome when susceptible pregnant cattle, sheep and goats are infected  <cit> . these outbreaks have been observed in japan, korea, taiwan, australia, israel and turkey  <cit> , and have repeatedly caused serious economic losses in the livestock industry. it is estimated that more than  <dig> abnormal calves were born during the largest outbreak in 1972â€“ <dig> in japan. following that outbreak, attenuated and inactivated vaccines have been developed on the basis of the obe- <dig> strain isolated from a naturally infected bovine fetus in  <dig> to prevent the disease  <cit> .

it is apparent that akabane virus shares many common features with other members of the genus orthobunyavirus  <cit> . it possesses a lipid envelope and a genome comprising three segments of a single-stranded, negative-sense rna designated large , medium  and small   <cit> . the l rna segment encodes the l protein which contains rna polymerase activity for replication and transcription of the viral genome. the m rna segment encodes two viral envelope glycoproteins , and a nonstructural  protein in the form of a precursor polypeptide which is processed by post-translational cleavage. the glycoproteins are responsible for viral neutralization, hemagglutination and attachment to the host cell receptors, while the nsm protein seems to be involved in the process of virus assembly and morphogenesis  <cit> . the s rna segment encodes the nucleocapsid  protein and a smaller nonstructural  protein in overlapping reading frames. the n protein shares common antigenic determinants with some other species in the genus. the nss protein may serve as an alpha/beta interferon antagonist and may be active in the regulation of host protein synthesis and apoptosis  <cit> .

since the strain jagar  <dig>  was first isolated from aedes vexans and culex tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes in gunma prefecture in  <dig>  <cit> , many strains have been continuously isolated from the culicoides species and cattle in japan  <cit> . recent studies have demonstrated that there are considerable variations in virulence, antigenic properties and nucleotide sequences among the field isolates of akabane virus  <cit> . in particular, the iriki strain is recognized as a typical variant of the virus  <cit> . a disease characterized by nervous symptoms was observed in ten calves ranging in age from  <dig> days to  <dig> months in southern japan from october to november,  <dig>  a strain, named 'iriki', was isolated from the cerebellum of a calf with nonsuppurative encephalitis and identified as an antigenic variant of akabane virus by the cross-neutralization test. subsequent seroepidemiological investigation and experimental infection of calves have established that this strain is the causative agent of the disease  <cit> . although akabane virus infection in mature cattle usually results in transient viremia without any clinical signs, a highly pathogenic strain might have the potential to cause encephalitis in cattle by postnatal infection. small-scale sporadic outbreaks of bovine encephalitis caused by akabane virus have also been reported in the neighboring countries of taiwan and korea  <cit> .

in  <dig>  bovine encephalomyelitis associated with akabane virus has broken out on a large scale in southern japan. in this article, we describe the clinical, epidemiological and histopathological features of the disease, and the antigenic and genetic characteristics of the strains isolated from the affected and clinically healthy calves in the epidemic area in order to contribute to the understanding of akabane viral encephalomyelitis.

RESULTS
clinical and epidemiological features
a total of  <dig> cattle with neurological disorders were reported in five prefectures  in the southern part of japan from the end of august to the middle of december in  <dig> . out of  <dig> affected cattle,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were observed in the kumamoto and kagoshima prefectures, respectively, in the kyushu district. the cattle ranged in age from  <dig> days to  <dig> months and showed astasia, dysstasia, ataxia, tremor, nystagmus, opisthotonus and hypersensitivity. astasia accompanied with paralysis of the hind legs and/or forelegs appeared in most of the affected cattle, while fever and anorexia were rarely detected. these symptoms were found principally in cattle under  <dig> months of age  of  <dig> cattle). no significant relationship was indicated between the disease and the breed or sex of the cattle.

histological findings and immunostaining for akabane virus antigens in the central nervous system of affected cattle
in  <dig> affected animals found in the kumamoto and kagoshima prefectures, no remarkable gross changes were observed in the brain, spinal cord, skeletal muscles or other organs. however, typical nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis characterized by severe to mild perivascular infiltration of mononuclear cells, glial nodules consisting of microglia , and neuronal degeneration and/or necrosis were considerably accumulated in the midbrain, cerebellopontine and medulla oblongata, but mildly in the cerebrum and cerebellum in most of the affected animals. in addition, neuronophagia was occasionally detected in the ventral horns of the spinal cord with moderate inflammatory changes. strong immunoreactivity for akabane virus antigens was mainly observed within the cytoplasm of neurons and nerve axons , and occasionally in vascular endothelial cells and macrophages aggregated in the perivascular cuffing  shown in the brain stem area of the affected animals. the intensity and number of focal areas of positive immunoreactivity for the virus antigens tended to increase with the severity of the inflammatory reaction.

rt-pcr detection and isolation of akabane virus
specific pcr products of  <dig> base pairs were detected in  <dig>  of  <dig> cattle with nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis. finally, seven virus strains were isolated from these pcr-positive specimens by hmlu- <dig> cell cultures. four strains were also isolated from the blood or plasma of clinically healthy calves collected between september and october on the affected farms. furthermore, a strain designated ksb-3/p/ <dig> was isolated from the healthy sentinel cattle in kyushu research station, national institute of animal health, in kagoshima prefecture during an outbreak of the disease. all  <dig> strains listed in table  <dig> were identified as akabane virus by the immunobinding assay.

antigenic characterization of the akabane virus isolates
all of the isolates reacted clearly with a monoclonal antibody to the n protein and four of seven neutralizing monoclonal antibodies recognizing epitopes a <dig>  a <dig>  b and c <dig> on the gc protein of the akabane virus obe- <dig> strain  <cit> . the result of an immunobinding assay for the km-1/br/ <dig>  a representative strain of  <dig> isolates, was shown in figure  <dig>  the reaction pattern was almost the same as that of the iriki strain and was classified in antigenic group  <dig> as described by yoshida and tsuda  <cit> .

further antigenic comparison between one of the isolates, km-1/br/ <dig> strain, and the obe- <dig> and iriki strains was performed by the cross-neutralization test using rabbit antisera to these three strains. as demonstrated by the immunobinding assay, the km-1/br/ <dig> strain was antigenically identical to the iriki strain, but was distant from the obe- <dig> strain . the obe- <dig> strain has been neutralized by antibodies against the iriki and km-1/br/ <dig> strains as well as homologous strains.

serological surveys
serological investigations in the kumamoto and kagoshima prefectures indicated that  <dig>  of  <dig> cattle with neurological symptoms and  <dig>  of  <dig> cohabitated cattle without neurological symptoms in the case farms possessed the neutralizing antibody against akabane virus. annual serological surveillance of arthropod-borne viruses demonstrated that  <dig>  of  <dig> healthy sentinel calves in both prefectures exhibited seroconversion to akabane virus between september and november in  <dig>  no seroconversions to the other bovine arthropod-borne viruses, such as aino, bluetongue, chuzan, ibaraki and bovine ephemeral fever viruses, were observed in these sentinel calves this year.

sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses of the s and m rna genomic segments
nucleotide sequences of the s and m rna segments of isolates were determined, and their open reading frames  were compared respectively with those of the akabane virus strains previously reported  <cit> . the orf sequence of the s rna segment  was highly conserved among  <dig> strains isolated during an outbreak of bovine encephalomyelitis . the sequence identities among one representative strain of  <dig> isolates , iriki, obe- <dig> and the prototype strain jagar <dig> ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % at the nucleotide level and from  <dig>  to 100% at the amino acid level . the strains km-1/br/ <dig>  km-2/br/ <dig>  ks-2/mo/ <dig> and ksb-3/p/ <dig> were selected for further analysis of the orf sequence of the m rna segment  encoding the neutralizing antigen. the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the m rna segment were also well conserved among these four strains from  <dig> . as presented in table  <dig>  the representative strain, km-1/br/ <dig>  was more closely related to the iriki strain than to the obe- <dig> and jagar <dig> strains.

to define the genetic relationships between the strains isolated in  <dig> and the previous isolates of the akabane virus, the phylogenetic trees of these two segments were constructed. as previously reported  <cit> , the field isolates of akabane virus were segregated into four distinct lineages  based on the sequence of an m rna segment. genogroup i was subdivided into two monophyletic clusters, i a and i b. as shown in figure  <dig>  the km-1/br/ <dig> strain was classified into subgroup i a containing the iriki strain. the phylogenetic tree of the s rna segment was almost the same as that of the m rna segment   <cit> .

discussion
an epizootic of the disease with neurological disorders in cattle was observed in the southern part of japan from summer to autumn in  <dig>  it was initially suggested that the disease was associated with some neurotropic arthropod-borne viruses due to its seasonal occurrence over an extensive area and to the histopathological findings of the affected cattle. we eventually identified akabane virus as the cause of the disease, as in that observed in  <dig>  <cit> , through the detection of the viral antigen and genome in the clinical samples, the isolation of the virus from the affected and clinically healthy cattle in the epidemic area and serological evidence.

diseases caused by various arthropod-borne viruses, such as akabane, aino, chuzan, ibaraki and bovine ephemeral fever viruses, have been recognized as major obstacles to the production of beef and dairy cattle in japan. above all, akabane virus is considered to be the most important because the virus circulation has been observed almost every year for over four decades since  <dig>  seroconversion of sentinel calves has always been confirmed after the rainy season  through nation-wide serological surveillance of bovine arthropod-borne viruses. entomological investigations in southern japan continuing over two decades indicate that culicoides oxystoma is the principal vector and that bovine arthropod-borne viruses have been isolated between summer and autumn  when adult midges are abundant  <cit> . molecular analyses of the field isolates of akabane virus collected from  <dig> to the present in japan and phylogenetic comparisons with isolates from taiwan, israel, australia and kenya demonstrated that the virus circulating widely in asia seems to have evolved in a common gene pool and can clearly be differentiated from strains existing in oceania and africa  <cit> . given that akabane virus is unlikely to be persistent in the winter season in japan, these findings may suggest that the virus is introduced repeatedly from lower latitude areas  in asia, where the climatic conditions are more suitable, by infected culicoides biting midges carried on the seasonal wind over long distances  <cit> . a single strain adaptable to the japanese environment might spread transiently and cause the disease to recur seasonally  <cit> . however, the possibility of viral overwintering in culicoides larvae by vertical transmission should be confirmed by further investigations of virus-vector interactions.

no evidence of akabane virus circulation was observed in japan in  <dig> via nation-wide surveillance using sentinel animals. therefore, it is considered that a new strain initially invaded from overseas into kumamoto prefecture, where the first clinical case was reported on  <dig> august in  <dig>  and then was spread throughout the southern part of japan by culicoides biting midges until late autumn. the virus finally caused an unprecedented outbreak of encephalomyelitis, mainly in susceptible calves. the absence of the virus circulation in  <dig> may have increased the number of susceptible animals without antibody against akabane virus . this may be one of the factors that facilitated a large-scale outbreak of the disease.

there are four akabane virus genogroups, of which two groups, i and ii, are extant in japan  <cit> , whereas the field isolates can be separated into at least five antigenic groups by an immunobinding assay using neutralizing antibodies  <cit> . although several discrepancies exist between the genetic and antigenic classifications, the isolates in the antigenic group  <dig> are consistently included in subgenogroup i a  <cit> . twelve strains isolated during  <dig> were classified into subgenogroup i a together with the iriki strain which caused encephalitis in calves in  <dig>  when introduced by intracerebral inoculation, the iriki strain produced severe nervous symptoms in calves similar to those observed in natural infection  <cit> . interestingly, the histopathological findings in this report were also quite similar to those in cattle infected with the akabane virus iriki strain  <cit> . in contrast, the jagar  <dig> and obe- <dig> strains belonging to genogroup ii caused only slight or no nervous symptoms in the intracerebrally infected calves  <cit> . although more experimental data using some other strains and more clinical data in the field will be required to confirm precise relationship between pathogenicity and genogroups, these previous experiments and the epizootic of encephalomyelitis in  <dig> suggest that the neurovirulence of strains in genogroup i a is much stronger than that of strains in genogroup ii.

the km-1/br/ <dig> strain was isolated from a 4-day-old calf with nervous symptoms , indicating the vertical transmission of the virus from the infected dam to the fetus. we have therefore traced any abnormal births of cattle in the epidemic area. consequently,  <dig> cases of premature births and congenital abnormalities related to akabane virus have been confirmed from october  <dig> through april  <dig>  viral genome identical to that of the isolates in  <dig> was detected in four calves accompanied by nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis . akabane viral antigen was also found in the brain of one of four pcr-positive calves, but unfortunately no viruses were isolated from these calves. the akabane virus strains belonging to genogroup i a might be involved not only in encephalomyelitis by postnatal infection but also in conventional teratogenicity by transplacental infection. these strains have been frequently isolated in japan since  <dig>  <cit> . an antigenic difference was recognized between the obe- <dig>  and km-1/br/ <dig> strains as shown in this study. it is, therefore, better to develop a novel vaccine for proper prevention and control of the disease. the newly isolated km-1/br/ <dig> strain will be one of the candidates for the advanced vaccine. it will also be important to establish surveillance system in cooperation with countries where akabane virus is endemic in order to compare and share virological, epidemiological and entomological information.

CONCLUSIONS
a large-scale outbreak of the disease characterized by neurological symptoms such as astasia, ataxia, tremor, nystagmus, opisthotonus and hypersensitivity occurred in beef and dairy cattle in southern japan from summer to autumn in  <dig>  nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis was observed in these clinical cases by histopathological findings. akabane viral antigen and genome were detected in the central nervous system of the affected cattle. akabane virus was isolated not only from them but also from the blood samples of cohabitated and sentinel cattle in the epidemic area. the isolates were closely related to the iriki strain in genogroup i a, which caused encephalitis in calves in  <dig>  most of the affected cattle possessed the neutralizing antibody against akabane virus. seroconversion of the sentinel calves was also confirmed during an outbreak of the disease. no evidence of akabane virus circulation was observed in  <dig> in the nation-wide serological surveillance, suggesting that a new strain belonging to genogroup i a invaded southern japan from overseas in the summer of  <dig> and caused an epizootic of encephalomyelitis in cattle. it is recommended that an advanced vaccine be developed to control the disease properly.
