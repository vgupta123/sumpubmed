BACKGROUND
the polycomb group  proteins are found across the higher eukaryotes and are essential for normal development. pcg proteins were first identified in drosophila where they are required to maintain repression of homeotic genes  <cit>  and have since been shown to be required for the correct expression of many genes in plants and animals. the polycomb proteins make up two major protein complexes; polycomb repressive complex  <dig>  and prc <dig>  <cit>  which are conserved in animals and plants. prc <dig> catalyses trimethylation of histone h <dig> lysine  <dig> . the h3k27me <dig> is bound by prc <dig> which ubiquitinates histone h2a  <cit>  resulting in a compacted chromatin state that can be inherited through mitotic divisions.

plants have clear homologs of the four core protein components of prc <dig>  often with multiple genes encoding each component  <cit> . in arabidopsis, fertilization independent endosperm  is the single extra sex combs  homolog, curly leaf , swinger  and medea are enhancer of zeste homologs, fertilization independent seed  <dig>  vernalization  <dig> and embryonic flower  <dig> are suppressor of zeste  <dig> homologs and multi-subunit suppressor of ira  1– <dig> are homologs of nurf <dig>  of the msis, msi <dig> appears to be a component of prc <dig> complexes, linking prc <dig> to like heterochromatin protein  <dig>  <cit> , a protein that has prc1-like function in arabidopsis, while other msis  have roles outside the prc <dig> complex  <cit> . a loss of prc <dig> activity in arabidopsis, such as in clf swn double mutants and fie rnai plants leads to strong developmental defects, especially in organ identity  <cit> . whole genome chromatin immunoprecipitation  experiments have shown that about 20% of arabidopsis genes are marked by h3k27me <dig>  <cit> . the h3k27me <dig> targets have an over-representation of genes that are highly regulated as opposed to being constitutively expressed. h3k27me <dig> is generally associated with genes with low transcription activity  <cit>  consistent with h3k27me <dig> having a role in maintaining repression of gene expression. although large numbers of gene loci have h3k27me <dig> present, only a minority are de-repressed in vegetative tissues of plants mutant for prc <dig> components  <cit> . this indicates that in these tissues h3k27me <dig> is only critical for maintaining the repression of a subset of the h3k27me3-marked genes and presumably loss of h3k27me <dig> at other loci does not lead to their increased expression due to the absence of specifically expressed transcription factors.

a major unanswered question in understanding polycomb repression in plants is how specific loci are targeted by the polycomb complexes. polycomb recruitment has been best characterised in drosophila where regions of h3k27me <dig> are associated with sequence elements termed polycomb response elements   <cit> . drosophila pres are regions of up to a few hundred base pairs that were initially defined as being required to confer polycomb repression on their target genes. pres are able to recruit either prc <dig> or prc <dig> or both. pres contain binding sites for sequence-specific dna binding proteins. the binding sites for pleiohomeotic  and the related pho-like are a common element of drosophila pres, but they also contain sites for other dna binding proteins including gaga factor, pipsqueak and zeste. genome-wide studies show that the binding sites for these other factors only partially overlap with prc <dig> and prc <dig> target sites and the extent to which they contribute to pcg recruitment is not always clear  <cit> .

in mammalian systems, pres are less well characterised with the best examples being a  <dig> kb region from the mouse mafb gene and a  <dig>  kb region from the human hoxd cluster that confer pcg-dependent repression in reporter gene systems  <cit> . both these elements contain binding sites for yy <dig>  suggesting that there is at least some conservation of the mechanisms of pcg recruitment between mammals and insects. long non-coding rnas  have also been implicated in pcg recruitment in mammals. these can act in cis, such as the xist and kcnq1ot <dig> lncrnas that are involved in pcg recruitment in x chromosome inactivation and imprinting respectively  <cit> , or in trans, such as the hotair lncrna which is produced from the hoxc cluster and acts as a scaffold to recruit prc <dig> to the unlinked hoxd locus  <cit> .

at present less is known of the mechanisms by which genes are targeted by the pcg system in plants. there is some evidence for the presence of pre-like sequences in plants. a  <dig> bp element  has been identified from the promoter of the arabidopsis leafy cotyledon  <dig>  gene which is required for pcg repression and confers repression and h3k27me <dig> deposition on a transgene  <cit> . the lec <dig> promoter also contains a gaga element that is bound by arabidopsis gaga factors in vitro. mutation studies suggest that this gaga element has an activator or enhancer function and is not required for h3k27me <dig> deposition  <cit> . a second example of a plant pre-like sequence comes from the promoter of the brevipedicellus  gene. the asymmetric leaves  <dig> –as <dig> complex binds to defined sequences in the bp promoter to silence its expression  <cit> . the bp locus is marked by h3k27me <dig> which requires the as1-as <dig> complex. the as1-as <dig> complex interacts with prc <dig> components and the as1-as <dig> binding site from the bp promoter is sufficient to confer polycomb repression on a gus transgene. these properties are consistent with the as1-as <dig> binding site in bp functioning as a pre at which as1-as <dig> recruits prc <dig>  <cit> .

some evidence for lncrnas being involved in polycomb recruitment in plants comes from the flc gene which encodes a mads box repressor of flowering  <cit> . flc expression is repressed by vernalisation  and this repression is maintained in a prc2-dependent manner following return to warm growing conditions  <cit> . non-coding sense transcripts  produced from the large first intron of flc which are bound by the prc component clf, are required to maintain flc repression in the cold  <cit> , suggesting that the coldair transcript recruits prc <dig> to maintain flc repression.

to further explore the mechanisms of pcg recruitment in plants we carried out a chip-seq experiment to determine the genome-wide distribution of fie, the single esc homolog in arabidopsis which should therefore be present in all prc <dig> complexes. by comparing the fie binding sites with genome-wide h3k27me <dig> distribution we found over seven hundred high confidence fie binding sites. the fie binding sites were predominantly within gene bodies and were enriched for three sequence motifs including putative gaga factor binding sites.

RESULTS
identification of fie-ha binding sites by chip-seq
the fie protein is the only arabidopsis homolog of the esc protein and is present in all active prc <dig> complexes. hence chip using the fie protein as a target should identify all sites of prc <dig> interaction with the genome. we carried out chip-seq with a fie-ha protein complementing the fie- <dig> mutant in the c <dig> ecotype  <cit>  using aerial tissue of  <dig> day old seedlings. as the prc <dig> complex is thought to interact with either histones or dna binding proteins and not directly with genomic dna, we cross-linked the plant material prior to immunoprecipitation to preserve the interaction of fie-ha with its chromatin binding sites. in a parallel experiment, chip-seq was also carried out for h3k27me <dig> using non cross-linked chromatin from wildtype c <dig> seedlings. this native chip method is generally considered superior for assessing histone modifications  <cit>  while cross-linked chip is preferred for studying chromatin binding proteins. the chip-seq datasets were mapped to the arabidopsis genome and regions that were enriched in the immunoprecipitations compared to input samples were identified as described in methods. figure  <dig> shows example data for the lec <dig> and bp genes. this identified  <dig> peaks in the fie-ha data and  <dig> peaks in the h3k27me <dig> data using a q score of 10- <dig>  this q score was selected from a range that was tested on the basis that it identified the largest number of peaks from the chip samples with minimal false positive peaks from the input datasets .

h3k27me <dig> abundance and distribution is conserved between c <dig> and columbia ecotypes
the number of h3k27me <dig> peaks we identified was similar to that seen in previous analyses  <cit> . to determine whether these represent the same target sequences we compared the h3k27me <dig> distribution in our c <dig> dataset to a columbia  chip-chip dataset  <cit> . the peaks identified in our c <dig> h3k27me <dig> dataset were assigned to  <dig> genes, 77% of which were also present in the list of h3k27me <dig> genes from col . to verify this result and quantitatively compare the h3k27me <dig> abundance between the two ecotypes,  <dig> genes were randomly selected from each of three groups; present in c24+col, c24-only and col-only. we determined the h3k27me <dig> abundance at the centre of the peaks for these  <dig> genes, as well as for  <dig> regions with no h3k27me <dig>  by chip-qpcr on col and c <dig> seedlings grown under the same conditions . we found that all  <dig> c24+col genes had similar h3k27me <dig> abundance in both ecotypes. we found that  <dig> out of  <dig> genes selected as having either c24- or col-specific h3k27me <dig> actually had similar h3k27me <dig> abundance suggesting that there are false negatives in both datasets. therefore there are very few differences in h3k27me <dig> location and abundance between ecotypes, in agreement with previous observations for col versus ler <cit>  and col versus c <dig> or cvi  <cit> .

fie-ha peaks are associated with h3k27me3
the genomic locations of the peaks from our fie-ha and h3k27me <dig> chip-seq datasets were compared and grouped into three categories; fie-ha+h3k27me <dig>  fie-ha only and h3k27me <dig> only . we found that  <dig> of the fie-ha peaks overlapped with h3k27me <dig> peaks . to verify the chip-seq results we then selected two peaks at random from each of five confidence value bins for each category of chip-seq peak for further analysis by chip-qpcr . in addition to the  <dig> peaks for each of the three groups, we included the  <dig> regions with no h3k27me <dig> , which were also not fie-ha targets. the amplicons were placed in the centre of the overlap of the fie-ha+h3k27me <dig> peaks or the centre of the fie-ha or h3k27me <dig> only peaks. for chip-qpcr, new sample sets immunoprecipitated for fie-ha and h3k27me <dig> were prepared. as a positive control we carried out qpcr with flc amplicon 5a located in the first exon of flc which has detectable fie-ha binding and low but detectable h3k27me <dig>  <cit> . we found enrichment of h3k27me <dig> at all  <dig> h3k27me <dig> sites tested, confirming that the number of false positives in the h3k27me <dig> dataset is low . of the  <dig> fie-ha only regions, five showed a higher enrichment of h3k27me <dig> above background than the flc control primers, again showing that there are false negatives for h3k27me <dig> . the regions selected as having neither h3k27me <dig> nor fie-ha present had very low levels of h3k27me <dig>  the chip-qpcr for fie-ha verified  <dig> of  <dig> fie-ha+h3k27me <dig> peaks ,  <dig> of  <dig> fie-ha only peaks and showed no enrichment for the  <dig> regions where fie-ha was not detected in the chip-seq analysis . this indicates that the fie-ha+h3k27me <dig> peaks are the most reliable of the fie binding sites we identified, while the majority of the peaks identified as fie-ha only are likely to be false positives. therefore we focused on the fie-ha-h3k27me <dig> peaks in subsequent analyses. we noted that the abundance of h3k27me <dig> at the h3k27me3-only sites was on average significantly lower than that for the fie-ha+h3k27me <dig> sites .

fie-ha is enriched across gene body regions
the distribution of fie-ha and h3k27me <dig> was determined by plotting the chip enrichment of h3k27me <dig> and fie-ha in a gene-centric manner. we observed the characteristic enrichment of h3k27me <dig> across gene bodies   <cit> . fie-ha is also enriched across gene bodies , but with greater enrichment at the 5′ ends in comparison to the distribution of h3k27me <dig>  the size distributions of the fie-ha+h3k27me <dig> peaks  and all h3k27me <dig> peaks were compared  and found to show a similar distribution at size ranges up to about  <dig>  kb.

fie-ha genes are enriched for developmental functions
the genes associated with fie-ha+h3k27me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> only peaks were used to carry out a gene ontology  analysis on the two datasets , to determine whether there were any differences between the classes of genes with high-confidence fie binding peaks  and the bulk of the h3k27me <dig> targets in the genome. the gene classifications that were enriched in the two datasets were similar overall, however, the go categories for multicellular organism development, post-embryonic development, flower development and reproduction were more enriched in the fie-ha+h3k27me <dig> data. in addition there were a number of individual categories that were only present in one of the datasets; most of these categories were from the h3k27me <dig> dataset, which has the higher number of genes.

as there were differences in the functional categorisation of the genes in the fie-ha+h3k27me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> only gene groups, we determined whether these groups of genes differed in the extent to which their expression was under pcg regulation. we analysed gene expression in seedlings of the clf- <dig> swn- <dig> double mutant  <cit>  and a pool of intermediate phenotype t <dig> plants carrying an rnai construct against fie <cit>   using nimblegen arrays . the results from the array experiment were verified by rt-qpcr of six genes in both clf- <dig> swn- <dig> and sifie compared to wildtype . the clf- <dig> swn- <dig> mutant shows a more severe phenotype than the sifie plants and this is reflected in a greater number of gene expression changes in the clf- <dig> swn- <dig> mutant . the primary effect expected from loss of pcg function is up-regulation of genes that are repressed by the presence of h3k27me <dig>  however, it is clear that there are many secondary changes in gene expression, which can be seen in the large number of down- and up-regulated genes that are not associated with h3k27me <dig> in the clf- <dig> swn- <dig> and sifie expression data. the genes that are marked by h3k27me <dig> in wildtype plants and are up-regulated in clf- <dig> swn- <dig> and/or sifie include those where the presence of h3k27me <dig> is important in repressing gene expression; there were  <dig> such genes in the clf- <dig> swn- <dig> dataset and  <dig> in the sifie data with  <dig> genes common to both datasets . we compared the frequency at which genes associated with fie-ha+h3k27me <dig> or h3k27me <dig> were up-regulated; we found that there was about a two-fold higher proportion of the fie-ha+h3k27me <dig> genes up-regulated. for example 28% of the fie-ha+h3k27me <dig> genes were up-regulated in clf- <dig> swn- <dig> compared to 12% of the h3k27me <dig> alone genes. hence genes where fie is present are more likely to be those that are primarily maintained in a repressed state by h3k27me <dig> and for which activators of expression are present in the seedling tissue used in these experiments. this was also reflected in the go profiles of the genes up-regulated in clf- <dig> swn- <dig> and sifie which were similar to that of the fie-ha+h3k27me <dig> genes .

high confidence fie binding peaks contain putative gaga factor binding sites
if arabidopsis prc <dig> complexes are recruited through pre-like sequences some conserved motifs would be expected to be associated with the fie binding peaks identified by chip-seq. as the fie-ha+h3k27me <dig> peaks were the highest confidence fie binding sites, we used these peak sequences in a meme analysis. we searched for short motifs  on the basis that the known interaction sites of pre-binding proteins in drosophila are of approximately this length. this identified four motifs in the fie-ha+h3k27me <dig> peaks . we also carried out the same analysis on the h3k27me <dig> genes as well as the lower confidence fie-ha only peaks and a control set of random promoter sequences . motif  <dig> was present in all four analyses and so was not considered further. there were no additional motifs found in the h3k27me <dig> only data, in the fie-ha only data there were two additional motifs which were similar to motif  <dig> in the fie-ha+h3k27me <dig> peaks. comparison of the motifs in the fie-ha+h3k27me <dig> peaks to motif databases using tomtom identified motif  <dig> as similar to the tbf <dig> binding site , motif  <dig> as similar to a zinc finger protein binding site and motif  <dig> as similar to the gaga factor 1/trithorax-like binding site . we plotted the location of the putative tbf <dig> and gaga factor binding sites relative to gene bodies and found they mirrored the location of fie-ha+h3k27me <dig> peaks, being enriched across transcription units .

discussion
we have carried out a chip-seq analysis to identify binding sites for the prc <dig> component fie across the arabidopsis genome. in comparison to the numbers of h3k27me <dig> sites  we identified fewer high confidence sites of fie binding . as prc <dig>  and therefore fie, is required to deposit and maintain h3k27me <dig>  a similar numbers of peaks is expected in both experiments. the discrepancy could have some biological significance or be a technical artefact. a technical difference could be simply a consequence of the two chip experiments using different antibodies and targeting proteins that interact with chromatin in different ways. histone h <dig> is an intrinsic part of the nucleosome structure while fie is part of a protein complex that interacts with chromatin. although the fie-ha sample was cross-linked prior to immunoprecipitation, the indirect nature of the interaction between fie and the dna that is assayed by chip may make it harder to detect fie binding regions compared to h3k27me <dig> regions.

biological explanations for the low number of fie-ha peaks compared to h3k27me <dig> peaks could be that there are differences in the number of prc <dig> binding sites, the strength of prc <dig> binding or the amount of time that prc <dig> is present at a given locus. there is support for this last possibility from frap  studies in drosophila <cit>  which suggest that polycomb complexes are not constantly bound to chromatin and that the rate of assembly of polycomb complexes differs between loci. genome-wide comparison of h3k27me <dig> and prc <dig> in drosophila also identified ‘weak’ pcg sites  <cit>  where h3k27me <dig> but not prc <dig> was detected. the average abundance of h3k27me <dig> at the fie-ha+h3k27me <dig> peaks was significantly higher than at the h3k27me <dig> only regions . the genes associated with fie-ha+h3k27me <dig> regions were also more likely to be up-regulated in plants that have reduced pcg function. we speculate that these genes are ones for which activators are present in vegetative tissues  and hence there is a selection for increased prc <dig> occupancy to maintain high levels of h3k27me <dig> and repression of gene expression.

a search for sequence motifs in the high confidence fie binding sites identified four short conserved motifs. one of these was identified as being similar to the gaga factor binding site which is a component of drosophila pres. the gaga factor binds to many drosophila pres, but is also found in active promoters  <cit>  and is suggested to have roles in nucleosome depletion and pcg recruitment. in plants the gaga motif is often found within core promoter sequences  <cit> ; however the gaga motifs identified through fie-ha chip-seq are predominantly located in gene bodies. they are not found in analyses of random sequences, indicating that there is a positive association with prc <dig>  the h3k27me <dig> only sites did not contain the gaga motif and had lower levels of h3k27me <dig> than the fie-ha+h3k27me <dig> peaks. the fie-ha+h3k27me <dig> associated genes are also more likely to be up-regulated in plants which have a loss of prc <dig> function. based on this we speculate that the gaga motif has a role in strengthening polycomb recruitment to target genes for which polycomb regulation is the primary mode of repression.

one element that functions in a pre-like manner in plants is the rle element in the arabidopsis lec <dig> promoter  <cit> . rle is located near a gaga element; however this gaga element is not required for the function of rle. rle is at one edge of a region of fie-ha binding , which also includes the gaga element. the pre-like sequence identified in the bp promoter does not have any associated fie-ha binding in our high-confidence dataset, although there is evidence of fie-ha binding across the bp gene body . the bp pre-like region has been shown to bind clf-gfp expressed from a strong 35s promoter  <cit> , so it may be a site of weaker prc <dig> interaction. the gaga motif has also been identified in association with lfy binding sites  <cit> ; while some of these genes are also h3k27me <dig> targets, many are not. this suggests that in plants, as for drosophila  <cit> , the role of gaga factor is wider than pcg function.

although our data suggest that the gaga factor may be a common component in the pcg regulation mechanism in plants as well as in flies, there are differences in the structures of the regions occupied by prc <dig> and h3k27me <dig>  we did not find evidence for relatively narrow regions of prc <dig> binding with low h3k27me <dig> and depleted of nucleosomes, flanked by wide regions of h3k27me <dig>  as seen at many drosophila pcg targets. the observed co-localisation of fie-ha and h3k27me <dig> is more reminiscent of the data in mammalian systems  <cit> . the association of h3k27me <dig> and fie-ha binding with gene body regions appears to be particularly strong in plants compared to both mammals and insects.

CONCLUSIONS
we have used a genome-wide chip-seq approach to identify fie and hence prc <dig> binding sites across the arabidopsis genome. based on our high-confidence dataset we find that the regions of prc <dig> binding are largely within gene body regions and co-localise with h3k27me <dig>  the emerging reports of plant pres and our finding of gaga motifs at fie binding sites suggest that dna binding proteins have a role in recruiting prc <dig> in plants and that further dissection of potential pre-like regions could help our understanding of how the pcg system is recruited to specific genes in plants.
