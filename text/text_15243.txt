BACKGROUND
in the post-genomic era biological endeavours are more and more centred on understanding the different mechanisms of regulation of gene expression. an increasing number of interacting regulatory levels are being explored and, in this amazing landscape, alternative splicing is even more interesting because, starting from a relatively limited number of genes, it is involved in increasing proteome complexity,  <cit> . in relation to this, alterations of splicing patterns or mis-splicing of genes are involved in several pathologies,  <cit>  including several genetic diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy , myotonic dystrophy , alzheimer's disease , and retinitis pigmentosa . aberrant splicing has also been linked to cancer .

the human major histocompatibility complex  is located at chromosome 6p <dig> , and is ~ <dig> mb in length. it consists of three regions, the class i and class ii regions flanking the central class iii region. the class iii region is ~ <dig>  mb in length and contains 62– <dig> genes and 2– <dig> pseudogenes, depending on the haplotype  <cit> . of the predicted genes, at least  <dig>  have a definite or potential role in the immune system. the human mhc has been linked to susceptibility to many diseases, and often these associations cannot be fully explained by variation in the class i and ii genes  <cit> . therefore, the study of the class iii region genes, especially the novel genes with a potential role in the immune system, may provide insights into the understanding of these diseases. transcriptome studies of some mhc class iii region genes indicate a high rate of different splicing events. previously, we have defined precisely the alternative splicing patterns of a cluster of five genes of the lymphocyte antigen- <dig>  superfamily  <cit>  and characterised the expression of the corresponding proteins  <cit> . strong associations have been found between rheumatoid arthritis and the segment of the mhc class iii region which includes these ly- <dig> members. the characterisation of these transcripts is of great relevance for the understanding of human diseases.

ly- <dig> superfamily members are cysteine-rich, generally gpi-anchored, cell surface proteins which have definite or putative immune-related roles  <cit> . among these ly- <dig> mhc class iii region genes ly6g5b and ly6g6d showed a particular behaviour in the regulation of their expression  <cit> , involving an intron retention event. the intron retained is the first in the open reading frame and interrupts the protein just after the signal peptide introducing a premature stop codon. the presence of a premature block to transcription in this position should cause this intron-retaining transcript to undergo nonsense mediated decay   <cit> . however, this transcript is present and is generally more abundant than the correctly spliced partner in all cell lines and tissues analysed  <cit> . intron retention is the least characterised event of all alternative splicing types, mainly because of the exclusion of this phenomenon in many studies, due to the difficulty to differentiate it from genomic dna or incompletely-processed transcripts. moreover, it is not relevant to functional studies due to the introduction of premature stop codons. a number of studies indicate that up to 15% of human genes present at least one intron retention event, and that at least 22% of all informative intron-retention events are also present in the mouse transcriptome  <cit> . finally, many intron retention events occur in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions   <cit> , that are still incompletely characterised for most genes.

interestingly, we were also able to detect the presence of the exons of the ly6g5b and ly6g6d genes in transcripts derived from the upstream genes in the chromosome. this phenomenon, known as transcription induced chimerism , or tandem chimerism is still largely unknown in its mechanism, but it is being promoted as a novel way to increase combinatorial complexity of the proteome  <cit> . recent bioinformatics analyses, partially supported by experimental validation, show that this phenomenon could be quite frequent   <cit> . there are also cases of tic described in which a chimeric protein can be detected or a logical function inferred  <cit> .

here we report a precise description and quantification, of the transcripts generated by intron retention events, of the mhc ly6g5b and ly6g6d genes. as these transcripts have a premature stop codon, they should be degraded quickly by non-sense mediated decay. nevertheless, they seem to be stable and even the most abundant transcript, especially in tissue samples. this could indicate that these mis-spliced forms are real transcripts which could have potential regulatory functions. in addition, we show that the ly6g5b and ly6g6d genes can form chimeric transcripts with adjacent genes.

RESULTS
ly6g5b and ly6g6d transcript expression
the ly6g6d and ly6g5b genes express a small first intron  in the open reading frame which tends to be retained in the majority of cell lines and tissues, both in human and mouse rnas  <cit> . to better understand the regulation of expression of these genes we performed a detailed analysis of the two transcripts of the ly6g5b gene and their relative levels in some cell lines and tissues by real time rt-pcr. the results shown in figure  <dig> confirm that the intron-retaining form is the most abundant in all the samples analysed. the highest expression of this mis-spliced form was detected in lung, spleen, and in whole blood, and the k <dig> cell line. k <dig> cells also had the highest expression of the correctly spliced form.

transcript localisation, mrna stability and nmd escape
to ascertain that the intron retaining transcript we detected in our samples is not a splicing intermediate but a fully processed and exported mrna, we performed a differential extraction of the nuclear and cytoplasmic rna followed by rt-pcr . correctly spliced mrnas should be more stable after termination of transcription than the non-fully spliced forms containing a premature termination codon . to analyse whether that is the case for the mis-spliced forms, cells were treated with actinomycin d, a transcriptional inhibitor, to measure mrna decay rates and differences between the splice forms of the ly6g6d and ly6g5b genes and of other control genes.

treatment with actinomycin d indicated that these mis-spliced forms were stable in the cytoplasm, though there did appear to be cell-specific differences in stability for the ly6g6d gene, which seemed to be unstable in the k <dig> cell line, but stable in the raji cell line . interestingly, the mis-spliced  form of the ly6g5b gene was also more abundant in the cytoplasmic rna fraction of raji cells, relative to the correctly spliced form , compared to k <dig> cells . in addition, there appeared to be no differences in stability between the mis-spliced and correctly spliced forms of ly6g5b as there was no obvious decay of either form after transcription was stopped. for ly6g6d we were only able to amplify the mis-splced  <dig> bp form, and not the  <dig> bp properly spliced form . as control rnas we used the housekeeping genes β-actin and gapdh for evaluating abundance and rna quality and the β-globin rna as a control of a stable rna transcript  observing that the rna was not degraded by the treatment or by the rna isolation procedure. we also used c-myc as a control for unstable mrna transcripts and the intron of c-myc as a control for genomic contamination of the cytoplasmic rna fraction . the decay of the c-myc transcript indicated that the actinomycin d treatment was effective and the lack of c-myc intronic product in the cytoplasmic rna fraction showed there was no genomic contamination in the cytoplasmic fraction. the β-globin amplification showed genomic, or splicing intermediates, in the nuclear rna fraction  in addition to the correctly spliced form , while in the cytoplasmic rna fraction we could only detect the correctly spliced form , indicating no genomic contamination in the cytoplasmic fraction. in the case of β-actin and gapdh only the correctly spliced forms of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively, were obtained in the amplifications of the nuclear and cytoplasmic rna fractions. no genomic products  were observed in either rna fraction. all the controls were also performed with raji cell extracts and the same results were obtained . the results from all these experiments indicate that the unspliced ly <dig> transcripts are real transcripts and not due to genomic contamination.

we confirmed this experiment by measuring the levels of the two ly6g5b transcripts by a real time-pcr assay . in this case expression levels of the two splicing isoforms were normalised  <cit>  to either gapdh  or β-actin  levels in k <dig> and raji cells. as the transcripts for these two control genes also have their own kinetics of degradation we cannot measure an absolute stability of ly6g5b, but a relative stability compared to the control genes. in all cases we observed an increase in the relative expression of the ly6g5b isoforms with time, allowing us to conclude that the ly6g5b transcripts are more stable than actin and gapdh mrna .

as the intron-retaining transcripts of the two genes have a ptc they should be subjected to degradation by the nmd machinery. to see whether this process acts on the non-coding transcripts we looked at the effect of translational blockage on stability, as translation of the mrna has been shown to be required for nmd, probably for recognition of ptcs. cycloheximide inhibits the peptidyl-transferase on the large subunit of the eukaryotic ribosome, while puromycin is a trna analogue that causes premature chain termination. if the nmd pathway was in some way acting on the mis-spliced transcript, we would expect to see an increase in the intron-retaining form relative to that of the correctly spliced form . k <dig> cells were treated with either cycloheximide or puromycin and showed no increase in stability of the mis-spliced forms of ly6g5b and ly6g6d relative to the correctly spliced forms, suggesting that these mis-spliced transcripts are not subject to nmd .

luciferase assay
to understand whether the intron was retained for its own features such as weakly recognised by the splicing machinery, or in a regulated fashion dependent on the molecular environment, the first introns of ly6g5b and ly6g6d were cloned in the 5' and 3' utrs of a pgl <dig> control luciferase plasmid . as some splicing factors inhibiting 5' splice site recognition, like hnrnp-f/h, have been described to bind just upstream of the 5' splice site  <cit> , we also created some constructs containing  <dig> bases of the first exon just upstream of the intron, to generate part of the natural sequence context . the results obtained showed, surprisingly, that the intron is fully spliced in this artificial mrna assay, as the size of the amplified product from rna derived from cells transfected with the g5bf+ <dig> plasmid, which contains the intron in the 5'utr of the luciferase construct, is the same as the control ctr+ <dig> . when the luciferase assay was performed in these transfected cells, surprisingly we found that the luciferase signal was increased more than  <dig>  fold when the intron of ly6g5b  was inserted in the 5' utr in the correct orientation, probably due to a strong stabilisation effect  <cit>  when splicing occurs in this position . this effect is also observed, although to a lesser extent, in the construct with the  <dig> bp of the ly6g5b first exon   and is not observed with the ly6g6d intron  . constructs that retain the intron, the one with the intron in the reverse orientation   and g5br+ <dig>  and the other with the mutated intron boundaries , show a markedly lowered expression of the luciferase. this could be due to the presence of other start codons in the intron in both orientations, which are not in phase with the luciferase orf.

est analysis of the ly6g5b and ly6g6d genes
to better define the expression pattern of these genes in order to characterise the utrs and to support our data on intron retention in the expressed transcripts, we performed a detailed est analysis on the two genes. we previously  <cit>  presented an est analysis, but at that time only two ests were found for each of the two human genes , making it difficult to completely define the gene. for ly6g6d there is only one additional est from the  <dig> analysis  <cit>  that aligns with the whole intron-retaining transcript; while the previously described ests only cover exon  <dig> of the gene. thus, there is still no est corresponding to the correctly spliced and protein expressing form, despite the fact that we could find the correctly spliced form in many human tissues  <cit> . this is most likely due to the small number of ests, especially for low expression transcripts, and to the limitations of the est data bank that often presents only partial sequences.

in contrast, our recent analysis has revealed that for ly6g5b there are a total of  <dig> ests covering the whole gene, part of the 5' utr and 3'utr . an additional intron and a fourth exon are probably present in the 3'utr, as many ests map in that region. at least  <dig> out of the  <dig> ests containing exon  <dig> continue for about  <dig> bases after the stop codon where the alignment is interrupted, then most of them align with a region about  <dig> bases downstream of the end of the exon, just downstream of an alusx element. another alu repeat of the family alujb is contained in the second intron. two ests  contain a final polya signal that defines a fourth and last exon of at least  <dig> bases. we could also define a large 5'utr for the ly6g5b gene, as one est  extends up to  <dig> bases upstream of the translation start site. among all ests we only found two  which cover the entire exon  <dig>  intron  <dig>  exon  <dig> region. surprisingly three ests  of the human ly6g5b transcript align with some exons of the gene found upstream in the genomic sequence, the casein kinase ii beta subunit  , suggesting the presence of transcriptional induced chimerism.

columns are marked with a x if the est contains the whole sequence. chim column is marked if any sequence of csnk2b is present. 1/ <dig> and 1/ <dig> mean that only this proportion of the sequence is present in the est.

chimeric transcripts
to prove the presence of the chimeric transcript for ly6g5b we performed rt-pcr using primers from the second, fifth and sixth exons of the csnk2b gene and the third exon of ly6g5b . we found a defined pattern of bands  in raji, k <dig> and u <dig> cells whose sequences represent many combinations of exons from the two genes . three main bands of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp were found when the nested rt-pcr was performed for the whole chimeric transcript. the first  corresponds to exons  <dig> to  <dig> of csnk2b spliced to exons  <dig> and  <dig> of ly6g5b though the resulting chimeric transcript is not in frame with the ly6g5b orf. the other two bands of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp correspond to exons  <dig> to  <dig> of csnk2b spliced to the last  <dig> nucleotides of exon  <dig> and exons  <dig> and  <dig> of ly6g5b , or directly to exons  <dig> and  <dig> of ly6g5b  which maintain the ly6g5b orf. other less abundant transcripts were also detected  which were confirmed when primers from exons  <dig> or  <dig> of csnk2b were used in the pcr reactions . amplification under the same conditions of the csnk2b gene using primers from exons  <dig> and  <dig> resulted in the appearance of a single band of  <dig> bp  corresponding to only one rna form, the one described in the literature  <cit> .

interestingly, when we performed blast analysis of the ly6g6d protein we found a perfect match to part of the human megakaryocyte-enhanced gene transcript  <dig>  protein  already deposited in genebank as a fusion gene with the accession number af <dig>  the megt- <dig> protein also showed a perfect match to the translation of exons 1– <dig> of the g6f gene. the g6f gene , which is expressed in platelets  <cit> , encodes a novel member of the immunoglobin superfamily  <cit> . g6f consists of six exons, ly6g6d of three exons and they are separated by the three exons of ly6g6e, which are theoretically transcribed in the reverse orientation to g6f and ly6g6d . we then confirmed that the megt- <dig> transcript consists of exons 1– <dig> of g6f, which then splice to exons  <dig> and  <dig> of ly6g6d, skipping exons  <dig> and  <dig> of g6f, all of ly6g6e and exon  <dig> of ly6g6d .

to examine the expression patterns of the g6f/ly6g6d chimera, two different rt-pcr reactions were performed in a number of different human cell lines, one amplifying from exon  <dig> of g6f to exon  <dig> of ly6g6d, and the other amplifying from exon  <dig> of g6f to exon  <dig> of ly6g6d, to see whether a shorter transcript was also present  as exon  <dig> of g6f, which normally codes for the transmembrane region of the protein, could act as a signal peptide. southern blot analysis  showed that there are different transcripts produced from the g6f exon  <dig> – ly6g6d exon  <dig> amplification . a ~ <dig>  kb doublet is present mainly in the k <dig> cell line as well as a faint band at ~ <dig> bp and a band at ~ <dig> bp . the  <dig>  kb band is also present faintly in the hl <dig>  jurkat and molt <dig> cell lines corresponding to the expected transcript, consisting of exons 1– <dig> of g6f, spliced to exons  <dig> and  <dig> of ly6g6d . this would translate to give a chimeric transcript containing the ig domain and the transmembrane region of g6f fused to the ly- <dig> domain of ly6g6d. the upper band of the ~ <dig>  kb doublet consists of exons 1– <dig> of g6f spliced to exons  <dig> and  <dig> of ly6g6d  which translate to a g6f protein including the transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain due to an inframe amino acid sequence encoded by exons  <dig> and  <dig> of ly6g6d. other secondary bands have been cloned and are represented in figure 7a, but none retain the ly- <dig> orf.

splice variants of the expected ~ <dig> bp shorter form of the chimera  were seen in all cell lines except hela, with the strongest signal in the k <dig>  jurkat, molt <dig>  and 143b cell lines . after sequence analysis three different splice variants were found; including the expected form of  <dig> bp which results in a signal peptide followed by the ly- <dig> domain. other secondary bands are shown in the figure but they lose the ly- <dig> orf and do not match with any known or predicted protein.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
during the last fifteen years a major effort has been centred on describing the number and the position of all human genes and this aim has been achieved through a combination of advances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics prediction programs. nevertheless, there are still a considerable number of genes that remain uncharacterised, and even more where we know virtually nothing of their transcriptional control including their differential tissue expression and splicing regulation. in addition, bioinformatics tools are becoming very accurate in organising biological information and predicting the structure and function of genes, but sometimes adjustments in data processing can affect the conclusions which can be drawn. for instance, in the case presented here, the fact that non-coding transcripts sometimes are excluded from analyses and databases, to avoid the risk of considering non-fully processed intermediate transcripts, could cause a significant underestimation of the frequency of intron retention transcripts.

alternative splicing is understood as a regulatory process, contributing to biological complexity through its ability to control the expression of proteins. an mrna variant has been defined as being 'functional' if it is required during the life-cycle of the organism and activated in a regulated manner. in some cases, functional splice forms may not even be required in their own right, but their production is required to regulate active protein levels. moreover, the meaning of 'required' can be generalized by defining functional splicing as that which conveys a selective advantage  <cit> .

the extent to which splicing has a role in disease, as either a direct cause, a modifier or a susceptibility factor, continues to be defined. advances in several areas will clarify the roles of splicing in disease and reveal the mechanisms involved, and will allow routine application of the knowledge gained toward diagnosis and treatment. one major advance will be to develop the ability to predict splicing outcomes associated with genetic variants and disease-causing mutations  <cit> . important insights will be gained from the full characterization of the human transcriptome, which would provide a catalogue of all the splice variants expressed from each gene and identification of the isoforms that predominate in specific cell types and tissues. this is a significant challenge that will have a huge benefit, not least being the ability to design microarrays that can be applied for the quantitative assessment of all splice variants. finally, another key direction for the future will be the application of genome-wide microarray assays to assess splicing differences associated with normal variation and with disease. alternative-splicing signatures are likely to provide a useful diagnostic and prognostic tool for many diseases. as for other challenges, the tools that are required to meet this challenge are developing rapidly  <cit> .

here we have presented a detailed transcriptional analysis of the ly6g5b and ly6g6d genes. the striking feature which was observed in a first analysis was the intron retention event that generated a non-coding transcript. in fact, the protein coding transcript of these genes is the one described in databases, but we found that, by the retention of the first intron, its expression is nearly completely silenced. this event seems not just to be an inherent feature of the introns because they are spliced correctly when the introns are inserted in an artificial construct, such as the luciferase expression plasmid used in this study, although they are also able to markedly stabilise the artificial transcript. in order to be retained the introns must be in the genomic environment of their particular ly- <dig> genes, and for this reason might have a regulatory role in these genes. in addition, by real time rt-pcr we found that the retained and spliced forms are differentially expressed in tissues, indicating an active regulation of the non-coding transcript. we propose that when the gene is expressed the intron retention event could be regulated by a cis-acting element, acting on the processing machinery. it could be possible that this block in the expression is released only in a precise physiological response or at a particular developmental stage or in a specific pathologic process. related to this, yan et al.   <cit>  showed a novel gene saf, transcribed from the opposite strand of a noncoding intronic region of the fas gene, that acts in cis and regulates alternative splicing forms of fas. in addition, noncoding rnas are abundantly transcribed from the introns of 74% of all refseq genes  <cit>  and could be involved in regulation of alternative splicing in response to physiological and pathologic conditions.

another possibility is that the chimera represents an alternative way for the expression of the protein, that borrows the promoter of the preceding gene to be expressed and then by a combination of transcript and protein processing reaches its final expressed form. in the case of the g6f-ly6g6d chimera, for example, the megt- <dig> protein would encode two extracellular ig domains, a transmembrane segment and then the ly6g6d ly- <dig> domain intra-cellularly. interestingly, the fact that exon  <dig> of g6f could encode a signal peptide starting with a methionine residue and that there is a long intron between exons  <dig> and  <dig> in g6f, suggests the presence of a promoter region specific for the shorter transcript. the possibility of an alternative promoter in this case is also supported by the expression results, as the short chimera seems to be expressed in nearly all analysed cell lines while the long chimera is expressed mainly in the k <dig> cell line, which is also the only cell line that expresses g6f.

the particular behaviour of these genes could be more general, strengthening the importance of a detailed transcriptional analysis of every gene, because their physiological and pathological roles could be based on unexpected forms of expression regulation. susceptibility to human diseases is associated with genes in the mhc class iii region. microsatellite and snp genotyping studies have attempted to fine map the location of these genes, finding strong associations between rheumatoid arthritis and a  <dig> kb region in the mhc class iii region, which include these ly- <dig> members. the characterization of the ly- <dig> transcripts is of great relevance for the understanding of human diseases.
