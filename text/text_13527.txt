BACKGROUND
groundwater ecosystems are under constant threat from anthropogenic activities, yet remain relatively understudied to date  <cit> . amphipods are a major component of the fauna inhabiting these ecosystems <cit>  and the largest genus among them is niphargus, which is distributed across most of europe  <cit> . like many other groups of subterranean metazoans, niphargus amphipods are almost always blind  <cit>  and usually white  <cit> , hence their generic name . the taxonomy of the genus niphargus has been debated for the last  <dig> years  <cit>  and is presently in a state of flux with the discovery of numerous cryptic taxonomic units  <cit> . thus, understanding the biodiversity of this genus is of crucial importance to better grasp the origin and dispersion of the european groundwater fauna and to guide conservation efforts, as has previously been highlighted for gammarid amphipods in other ecosystems  <cit> .

unlike subterranean ecosystems that are fed by aboveground photosynthetic productivity  <cit> , chemoautotrophic caves such as movile in romania  <cit> , frasassi in italy  <cit>  and ayyalon in israel  <cit>  receive their energy input mostly in the form of the chemical hydrogen sulfide arising from underground reservoirs. chemoautotrophic microorganisms use the energy derived from sulfide oxidation to fix carbon and thereby form the basis of the food chain in these thriving cave ecosystems. however, sulfide is toxic for aerobic organisms  <cit>  as it inhibits mitochondrial electron transport  <cit> ; besides, it reacts with oxygen, causing hypoxia  <cit> . hence, animals inhabiting sulfide-rich environments  face specific metabolic challenges that they counter with avoidance behaviors, adaptations such as sulfide-oxidizing mitochondria and sulfide-binding proteins, or symbioses with sulfide-oxidizing bacteria  <cit> .

amphipods generally have a low tolerance to sulfide, even though some species may be quite resistant to hypoxia  <cit> . niphargus ictus is the numerically dominant macroorganism in the sulfide-rich frasassi cave ecosystem and has been the sole amphipod species reported to date from this location  <cit> . it thrives in the sulfidic streams and pools found in various parts of the cave, and a possible explanation for its tolerance to sulfide may lie in its symbiosis with chemoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria of the genus thiothrix  <cit> . such chemoautotrophic symbioses are common in marine environments  <cit> , but appear much rarer in freshwater where the n. ictus symbiosis is the only example reported to date.

caves in frasassi are developed in a limestone platform interspersed with a network of fractures that influence its hydrogeology  <cit>  and could cause habitat fragmentation. furthermore, the streams and lakes within the cave system have widely different sulfide and oxygen concentrations  <cit> , which could lead to the occurrence of distinct niphargus populations with varying tolerances to sulfide and hypoxia. to test these hypotheses, we sequenced mitochondrial and nuclear sequence markers for  <dig> niphargus samples collected throughout the accessible parts of the cave system and complemented these molecular analyses with morphological and behavioral observations. since our study unexpectedly revealed the presence of four niphargus clades within frasassi, we further examined the relationship between these clades by building a 28s ribosomal dna  phylogeny including all niphargus sequences presently available in genbank.

RESULTS
molecular analyses
for each marker analyzed , results obtained using distance, parsimony and likelihood methods were congruent in delimiting four niphargus clades among our samples . clade  <dig> comprised  <dig> individuals collected in five sampling sites in the north-eastern part of the cave complex , clade  <dig> grouped  <dig> samples from all sites except three , clade  <dig> comprised  <dig> specimens from a single location on the northern side of the river , and clade  <dig> was represented by only two individuals from one remote site in the south . bootstrap values for the monophyly of the clades were very high  using all three phylogenetic methods. some locations were sampled more than one time in two or three different years  but no time variation in the geographical repartition of the clades was detected. average patristic distances between clades calculated from the coi tree  were all above the  <dig>  threshold proposed for species delimitation in crustacea  <cit> ; the lowest value was found for the distance between clades  <dig> and  <dig>  indicating that these two clades are the most closely related among the four.

a 28s rdna phylogeny of the genus niphargus, including representative sequences from each frasassi clade and all sequences available in genbank, confirmed the separation between the clades and the close relationship between clades  <dig> and  <dig> . the niphargus present in frasassi do not form a monophyletic group within the genus but fall instead into three distinct regions of the tree.

morphological analyses
the morphometric analysis of seven quantitative characters shows that clades 1- <dig> are morphologically distinct, with no overlap among them . the first component  explained  <dig> % of the variation  and distinguished clade  <dig> from the other two predominantly based on its larger gnathopods. the second component  explained  <dig> % of the variation  and distinguished clade  <dig> from the other two based on its smaller head, longer antennae and deeper ventral channel .

only the morphology of clade  <dig> individuals corresponds to the published description of n. ictus  <cit> : clade  <dig> individuals seem related to n. longicaudatus, a complex of several cryptic species or subspecies in need of taxonomic revision  <cit> , whereas clade  <dig> shares some morphological characteristics with the n. rejici species complex found in slovenia and some adriatic islands  <cit> . as for clade  <dig>  for which only two badly damaged samples are available at the present time, its morphology appears similar to clade  <dig>  but more specimens need to be collected before definite conclusions can be reached regarding its identity.

behavioral observations
the behavior of clade  <dig> individuals was observed in two sites , where they were found to spend most of their time crawling on their sides on bacterial mats and sediment. when disturbed, they swam poorly and for short durations . in contrast, clade  <dig> individuals observed in lago verde were found to be strong swimmers, achieving speeds of 1- <dig> body lengths per second, and were able to swim continuously for more than  <dig> seconds. in pozzo dei cristalli, a 10-meter long stream with a stagnant pool in the middle, some niphargus were observed to crawl on bacterial mats whereas others were swimming in the stagnant pool. as our  <dig> and  <dig> data showed that both clades  <dig> and  <dig> were present in this location,  <dig> individuals of each behavioral type were collected in  <dig> and analyzed morphologically and molecularly: all crawling niphargus were found to belong to clade  <dig>  whereas all swimming individuals belonged to clade  <dig> 

even though clade  <dig> was only present in il bugianardo where it co-occurred with clade  <dig>  it could be easily distinguished in the field due to its much larger size, allowing comparative behavioral observations of clade  <dig> and clade  <dig> individuals in this location. clade  <dig> individuals were found to spend most of their time swimming in the deeper parts of the pool, whereas clade  <dig> predominantly crawled on limestone boulders.

discussion
four niphargus clades are present in frasassi, among which only two are closely related to each other
prior to this study, only one niphargus species had been reported from the frasassi cave system and this species, described as n. ictus, was supposed to be endemic to this locality  <cit> . here we show that  <dig> molecularly distinct clades are actually present in frasassi, with patristic distances  between them higher than the  <dig>  threshold proposed for species delimitation in crustacea  <cit> . the perfect agreement between independent nuclear and mitochondrial datasets further suggests that these four clades are not just an instance of intraspecific variation but represent four distinct monophyletic taxa of putative species level. among them, clades 1- <dig> can be also be diagnosed morphologically and behaviorally . moreover, there was no heterozygous individual harboring nuclear its sequences from more than one clade: thus, these four clades appear reproductively isolated from each other  <cit> , which further suggests that they represent distinct species following the biological species criterion  <cit> .

the most parsimonious explanation for the observed polyphyly of niphargus within frasassi  is that this cave system was colonized at least three times by different amphipod lineages since the start of its formation less than  <dig> million years ago  <cit> : one lineage that had only been reported until now from the dinaric region , a second lineage found presently on both sides of the adriatic sea , and a third lineage  only found in frasassi to date. analysis of samples from caves in the surrounding area will be required to find out whether the closely related clades  <dig> and  <dig> invaded the frasassi cave system independently or if speciation occurred within frasassi from their invading common ancestor.

water chemistry and flow regime seem to influence the repartition of the four clades in frasassi
the areas of occurrence of the four clades in frasassi are overlapping  but show some correlation with groundwater chemistry and hydrological flow regimes. clade  <dig> occurs only in shallow, flowing streams and predominantly at relatively low sulfide concentrations ; however, sulfide tolerance does not appear to be a limiting factor for this clade since it is also found in pozzo dei cristalli, a stream characterized by much higher sulfide levels . clade  <dig>  is predominantly found in lakes with calm and deep waters , with sulfide concentrations spanning the whole range of values measured in frasassi . clade  <dig> occurs only in il bugianardo, a location with no detectable sulfide that is also the only sampling site located north of the sentino river. clade  <dig> has so far only been collected from lago primo, a stratified lake with oxygenated water on top and reducing, sulfidic waters at depths greater than  <dig>  meters . at a more local scale, members of various clades were found to occupy different microhabitats in locations where they co-occur. in pozzo dei cristalli, where clades  <dig> and  <dig> cohabitate, clade  <dig> was restricted to fast-flowing portions of the stream that were less than  <dig> cm deep and clade  <dig> to stagnant parts that were deeper than  <dig> cm. in il bugianardo, clades  <dig> and  <dig> co-occur in a small pool that is 10-  <dig> cm deep: there, clade  <dig> members were found crawling on limestone boulders and within interstitial crevices, whereas clade  <dig> members were swimming in the deeper parts of the lake.

the "crawling" species  have restricted areas of repartition in comparison with the "swimming" clade  <dig>  that was sampled everywhere except in three streams . large lakes with deep water dominate the southern recesses of the frasassi cave network, and a gradual slope causes water to flow towards the sentino river. the remarkable swimming ability of n. ictus could enable it to move upstream and across large bodies of deep water, allowing it to occupy most of the water bodies within frasassi . clade  <dig>  on the other hand, might be restricted by its poor swimming ability to shallow streams , whereas the limited distribution of clade  <dig> may be either due to its inability to cross the barrier created by the sentino river or to its lower tolerance to sulfide compared with clades  <dig> and  <dig>  unlike clade  <dig>  that is found in most parts of the cave system , clades  <dig> and  <dig> appear restricted to few, easy-to-reach locations and may require specific conservation efforts in the future.

at least two of the frasassi niphargus clades are symbiotic
when the symbiosis between niphargus and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria was discovered in frasassi  <cit> , all the niphargus individuals used in that study were assumed to be conspecific since n. ictus was the only species reported within the cave system  <cit> . the unexpected finding of four distinct clades in the present study prompted us to reexamine the previously published data regarding this symbiosis. among these data, niphargus individuals from the study sites grotta sulfurea, where only clade  <dig> has been found, and lago verde, inhabited only by clade  <dig> , were both found to be symbiotic with sulfur-oxidizing thiothrix bacteria using fluorescence in situ hybridization  analyses  <cit> . we have subsequently confirmed this finding by scanning electron microscopy and by sequencing bacterial 16s rdna libraries . additional investigations will be required to find out whether clades  <dig> and  <dig> are also symbiotic, and whether bacterial symbionts are different between niphargus clades.

coi and its are useful molecular markers for the taxonomy of niphargus
prior to the present study, the coi barcode marker  <cit>  had only been sequenced for very few species of niphargus  <cit>  whereas the its region of this genus had never been analyzed. here we demonstrate that coi and its can conjointly be used to delineate niphargus species, and may become of standard use in future taxonomic studies of niphargus as they are already the most commonly used markers in other groups of organisms  <cit> . the 12s marker, on the other hand, is shorter and more difficult to align than coi, but can still prove useful when dealing with populations or individuals for which obtaining non-ambiguous coi sequences is difficult . as for nuclear markers, an aim in future studies should be to develop primers targeting variable regions other than its, such as introns, as it is only by constructing and comparing several independent gene trees that one may hope to build a species tree with a reasonable degree of confidence  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the molecular, morphological and behavioral data gathered in this study indicate that, instead of a single niphargus species, the chemoautotrophic cave ecosystem of frasassi hosts four distinct amphipod clades among which only two are closely related to each other; hence, there appears to have been at least three independent invasions of the frasassi cave system. moreover, the finding that two distantly related niphargus clades harbor symbiotic thiothrix bacteria paves the way for further studies concerning the origin and evolution of this unusual freshwater chemoautotrophic symbiosis.
