BACKGROUND
molecular chaperones participate in many important metabolic and survival reactions through dynamic interactions with various components of given processes. dnaj proteins, also called j-domain proteins, function as molecular co-chaperones of hsp <dig> and play an important role in protein folding, unfolding, and assembly under both normal and stress conditions as well as in cellular secretory pathways  <cit> . they are divided into three categories according to their domain composition  <cit>  and have been identified in a variety of cellular compartments including cytosol  <cit> , mitochondria  <cit> , endoplastic reticulum  <cit> , and chloroplasts  <cit> . some of the dnaj proteins also bind to the plasma membrane  <cit> .

dnaj proteins belong to a large family with several members:  <dig> in yeast  <cit> ,  <dig> in humans  <cit>  and at least  <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> . according to our database searches at least  <dig> dnaj proteins of arabidopsis are predicted to have a chloroplast targeting signal and only few of them have been characterized. based on only a few published studies it seems that the chloroplast-targeted dnaj proteins participate in protein folding, unfolding and assembly processes  <cit> . vitha et al. reported that arc <dig>  a chloroplast-targeted dnaj-like protein localized to the plastid envelope membrane, participates in division of plastids probably by functioning in the assembly and/or stabilization of the plastid-dividing ftsz ring in arabidopsis  <cit> . it has been found that atj <dig>  a chloroplast stroma localized dnaj protein, is ubiquitously expressed in all plant organs examined so far  <cit> . dnaj proteins found in the arabidopsis chloroplast thylakoid proteome are likely to be important in thylakoid biogenesis  <cit> . indeed, in chlamydomonas, one chloroplast-targeted dnaj protein was demonstrated to function in biogenesis of the thylakoid membrane  <cit> .

three dnaj proteins, namely at <dig> g <dig>  at <dig> g <dig> and at <dig> g <dig>  or atj <dig>  atj <dig> and atj <dig>  are small chloroplast-targeted dnaj proteins in arabidopsis with predicted molecular masses of  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -kd, respectively. these three proteins belong to the simplest group of the dnaj proteins  characterised by only one specific domain, the j-domain  <cit> . according to public microarray databases their gene expression patterns resemble each other  <cit> . we previously found that atj <dig> gene is upregulated in darkness  <cit>  similar to that of atj <dig> gene . to get more insights into the function of these small dnaj proteins, the t-dna insertion knockout mutants for atj <dig>  atj <dig> and atj <dig> proteins, hereafter referred to as j <dig>  j <dig> and j <dig>  respectively, were isolated and characterised. the results provide evidence that the atj <dig>  atj <dig> and atj <dig> proteins participate in optimization of various reactions of photosynthesis, and conversely, their absence triggers a global stress response.

RESULTS
characterization of dnaj single mutants
arabidopsis plants lacking a dnaj protein atj <dig> , atj <dig>  or atj <dig>  did not exhibit significantly different phenotypes compared to wild-type  except for slightly stunted growth of the j <dig> and j <dig> mutants . photochemical efficiency of photosystem ii   was not different between the wt and the dnaj mutants under growth light  conditions, whereas, it decreased somewhat more drastically in the mutants after exposure of  <dig> h to high light  , especially in j <dig> and j <dig> as compared to that in wt . when plants were returned to gl conditions, the psii photochemical efficiency recovered quickly and no differences were found between the wt and mutants . the other mutant lines for the atj <dig> and atj <dig> proteins exhibited similar phenotypes as described above .

localization of the three dnaj proteins
in order to examine the localization of the three small dnaj proteins, an antiserum for each protein was raised in rabbits using specific synthetic peptides. despite purification of the antisera, we did not get good reactions using leaf total protein extracts . however, as shown in figure  <dig>  the protein extracts from intact chloroplasts gave a specific band in wt around  <dig> kd,  <dig> kd, and  <dig> kd when the atj <dig>  atj <dig> and atj <dig> antisera, respectively, were used, and importantly, the specific band was missing from the respective dnaj mutant. this indicates that chloroplasts are at least one of the compartments containing these small dnaj proteins in arabidopsis. it should be noted that the size of each dnaj protein in chloroplasts is somewhat lower than the predicted molecular mass . this is apparently due to the processing of the preprotein after import to chloroplast. in fact, orme et al. reported that atj <dig> is located in chloroplast stroma and the mature protein has a molecular mass of  <dig>  kd  <cit> .

capacity of co <dig> assimilation
to analyse whether the dnaj proteins are involved in acquiring the maximal co <dig> fixation capacity, we measured both the light response and co <dig> response curves of the dnaj mutants and wt. the light response curves showed the maximum co <dig> assimilation rate at  <dig> μmol photons m- <dig> s- <dig> which then decreased with increasing photosynthetic photon flux density  in both wt and the dnaj mutants . compared to wt, the dnaj mutants possessed lower co <dig> assimilation, especially the j <dig> mutant. relatively, the assimilation of j <dig> was only slightly lower as compared to wt, showing that the atj <dig> protein is less related to the light-dependent regulation of co <dig> fixation. nonetheless, the co <dig> response curves revealed lower co <dig> assimilation in j <dig> as compared to that in wt . the a-ci curves based on intracellular co <dig> concentration less than  <dig> μmol mol- <dig> demonstrated a lower rubisco activity in all three dnaj mutants as deduced from lower slope values of the curves as compared to wt, especially for j <dig> . although the amount of the rubisco protein  did not obviously differ between wt and the dnaj mutants, an immunoblot analysis of rubisco activase showed reduced amounts of this enzyme under light conditions in the dnaj mutants as compared to wt .

stabilization of psii dimers and supercomplexes under high light illumination
since the absence of one of the dnaj proteins, atj <dig>  atj <dig> or atj <dig>  pronouncedly affected the photosynthetic capacity of respective mutants, we next investigated whether the dnaj proteins are involved in regulation of the stability of the photosynthetic pigment protein complexes in the thylakoid membrane. based on blue-native gel electrophoretic  separation of thylakoid protein complexes , the amount of psii-lhcii supercomplexes was less in the dnaj mutants than in wt after  <dig> h hl illumination . immunoblotting of the bn-gels with d <dig> antibody more clearly showed the decrease of psii supercomplexes in the mutants after the hl treatment. moreover, the amount of psii dimers also significantly decreased in the dnaj mutants upon the hl treatment, especially in j <dig> and j <dig> . to get more insights into the function of the three dnaj proteins in the maintenance of the psii oligomers, a long-term treatment under hl was employed. as shown in figure 4b, the psii supercomplexes completely disappeared both from wt and the dnaj mutants whereas the psii dimers were much more stable in wt than in the dnaj mutants in the course of the long-term hl treatment. as compared to wt, the dnaj mutants j <dig> and j <dig> showed a total disappearance of psii dimers already during  <dig> h of hl treatment , and clearly more of cp <dig> proteins had released from psii complexes at this time point as compared to wt or the j <dig> mutant. as the total amounts of the d <dig>  d <dig>  cp <dig>  cf <dig> and ndh-h proteins were similar in wt and the three mutants even after the hl treatment , it can be concluded that the three dnaj proteins do not participate in the biosynthesis of individual psii core proteins, but only provide stability for the psii protein complexes.

energy distribution between psi and psii and phosphorylation of the psii-lhcii proteins
the  <dig> k chlorophyll fluorescence emission ratio f733/f <dig> was recorded as an indication of energy distribution between the psi and psii complexes . the ratio of f733/f <dig> was slightly lower in the dnaj mutants than in wt both when measured from dark acclimated and from gl acclimated plants. after hl illumination no clear differences in f733/f <dig> ratio were found between the wt and mutants with one exception, the ratio was higher in j <dig> as compared to that in wt after  <dig> μmol photons m- <dig> s- <dig> hl illumination . to evaluate whether the phosphorylation of psii proteins is related to redistribution of energy in plants lacking the dnaj proteins, the phosphorylation levels of the major psii phosphoproteins d <dig>  d <dig>  cp <dig> and lhcii were determined by immunoblotting with the p-thr antibody. as can be seen in figure 5b, only extremely weak phosphorylation of lhcii  was detected in darkness and p-lhcii strongly accumulated in light conditions. higher intensity light  decreased the level of p-lhcii but did this less efficiently in the dnaj mutants than in wt . interestingly, lhcii was phosphorylated to the same level in all strains under gl and moderate hl , despite clear differences in the  <dig> k fluorescence ratio under these two light conditions.

as to psii core protein phosphorylation, under gl conditions the j <dig> and j <dig> mutants exhibited more p-cp <dig>  p-d <dig> and p-d <dig> proteins as compared to wt while the j <dig> had less . under hl conditions  the j <dig> and j <dig> mutants had a clearly higher level of psii core protein phosphorylation. a long-term hl illumination  experiment showed that fluctuations in phosphorylation of both the psii core and lhcii proteins were characteristic for wt during acclimation to this hl condition. the j <dig> mutant showed similar fluctuations, though not as drastic as in wt . the j <dig> and j <dig> mutants, however, differed from the wt and j <dig>  showing clearly delayed and less obvious drop in the phosphorylation level of both the psii core and lhcii proteins, which in wt and j <dig> occurred after  <dig> h illumination at hl whereas in j <dig> and j <dig>  a less distinctive drop in phosphorylation was recorded after  <dig> -  <dig> h illumination at hl. moreover in all dnaj mutants, j <dig>  j <dig> and j <dig>  long hl illumination resulted in more drastic phosphorylation of the cas protein , a typical stress response of plants  <cit> .

gene expression profiles
based on somewhat similar effects on photosynthetic parameters of the knockout of any of the three small chloroplast targeted dnaj proteins, it was of interest to analyse the gene expression profiles of these mutants. the expression of about  <dig>  genes showed more than two-fold changes in wt by hl treatment, and among those genes one third were upregulated . it was interesting to note that the gene expression profiles of the mutants showed similarities under both gl and hl conditions to the hl-treated wt, although the expression levels somewhat varied in each mutant . more than half of genes changing expression were found to be coregulated between the dnaj mutants, and all three mutants shared  <dig> and  <dig> coregulated genes under gl and hl, respectively, indicating their very similar response between the dnaj mutants . in each mutant, the expression of roughly  <dig> genes had changed independently of the growth light condition . it is also worth noting that the j <dig> and j <dig> mutants showed more divergent gene expression  at growth light from that in wt as compared to j <dig>  whereas after hl treatment the reverse situation was recorded . however, although the three dnaj proteins are localized in the chloroplasts, most of the genes related to thylakoid membranes were not affected by lacking of one of the small dnaj proteins .

more interestingly, the dnaj mutants showed stress-related regulation of several genes even at gl conditions. expression of a number of genes related to transcription, translation and cellular signaling and to enzymes participating in the control of reactive oxygen species  and in redox regulation resembled that observed in wt upon transfer to hl . nevertheless, the dnaj mutants also showed unique gene expression patterns from those induced in wt by hl treatment, including upregulation of several distinct genes encoding transcription factors, heat shock proteins, dnaj proteins as well as antioxidant and redox proteins, among others . additionally, by using the mapman tool, it was found that changes in expression of several genes related to distinct regulation pathways were quite similar in the dnaj mutants at gl conditions to those recorded in the hl-treated wt . several clustered genes related to different functions, including hormone metabolism, stress response, redox regulation, transcriptional regulation, and protein degradation, were visualized and the results show that almost the same numbers of genes were regulated by hl in wt or by the lack of one dnaj protein, atj <dig>  atj <dig> or atj <dig> at gl conditions . particularly, the genes related to ubiquitin and ubiquitin e <dig> presented a high correlation between the hl stress response in wt and the dnaj protein knockout .

oxidative stress tolerance in the dnaj mutants
based on the cues from microarray results, we next tested some oxidative stress responses of the dnaj mutants. at first, the h2o <dig> levels in the leaves of the dnaj mutants and wt were detected using dab  as a substrate. notably, the staining intensity and accordingly the level of h2o <dig> in the dnaj mutants was lower as compared to wt, especially in plants illuminated under hl for  <dig> h . since ascorbate peroxidases  and chloroplast peroxiredoxins  associated with the water-water cycle, are generally known protectants of chloroplasts against oxidative damage, the contents of these h2o2-detoxifying enzymes were evaluated by immunoblotting. as shown in figure 8b, the amounts of all these enzymes, including tapx , sapx , capx , and two prxs, prxe  and 2-cys prx , were pronouncedly higher in the three dnaj mutants as compared to wt no matter whether the plants were subjected to darkness, gl or hl conditions before measurements. nevertheless, higher amounts of these enzymes were present in the light conditions, especially in hl. these results suggest that the higher amounts of h2o2-detoxifying enzymes contributed to the lower h2o <dig> levels in the mutants.

to investigate the tolerance of the dnaj mutants to oxidative stress,  <dig> μm methyl viologen  was supplied to plants followed by illumination at  <dig> μmol photons m- <dig> s- <dig> hl for  <dig> h, and the cellular ion leakage of whole plant rosettes was determined. plants untreated with mv showed no differences in ion leakage between the dnaj mutants and wt. in wt plants the mv treatment strongly enhanced ion leakage levels, whereas in the j <dig> and j <dig> mutant plants the ion leakage was only slightly increased, indicating that the mutants had better resistance to mv-induced oxidative stress . although j <dig> exhibited similar levels of ion leakage as wt in mv treated plants, the oxidation level of leaf total proteins isolated from the mutant was less severe than that in wt after the hl treatment . in general, the dnaj mutants showed less oxidation of leaf total proteins, particularly the rubisco protein, as a response to environmental light intensity changes as compared to wt .

discussion
the dnaj proteins assist the hsp <dig> chaperone proteins, participating in protein folding, unfolding, and assembly processes  <cit> . such functions, based mainly on biochemical experiments, are still unproven for the chloroplast dnaj proteins, and their physiological roles remain largely unknown. here we particularly focused our study on the physiological role of the three small chloroplast-targeted dnaj proteins, atj <dig>  atj <dig> and atj <dig> which according to our database searches, only contain the j-domain  and thus possibly have divergent functions from ordinary dnaj proteins. although we did not obtain comprehensive information about the localization of the three small dnaj proteins in different cell compartments, the immunoblotting experiments with protein extracts from isolated chloroplasts clearly showed that the three dnaj proteins are targeted to chloroplasts in arabidopsis .

small chloroplast-targeted dnaj proteins participate in regulation of co <dig> fixation and in stabilization of psii supercomplexes and dimers
due to chloroplast location of the three small dnaj proteins, we applied simultaneous measurements of the responses of leaf gas exchange to light and co <dig> concentration  <cit> , which provided first evidence of limitation of the in vivo photosynthesis in all the three dnaj mutants. both the lower slopes of light response curves and lower co <dig> fixation at light saturation in the mutants   imply limitations in electron transport required for rubp regeneration, rubisco activity, or metabolism of triose phosphates  <cit> . the a-ci curves confirmed that particularly the activity of rubisco is compromised in the dnaj mutants, especially in j <dig>  considering the general function of the dnaj proteins as chaperone proteins  <cit> , the reduced amount of rubisco activase in the mutants reported here, suggests that the three small chloroplast dnaj proteins are involved in the folding, unfolding, or assembly processes of this enzyme and thus participate in regulation of rubisco activity  <cit> . it should be noted that the functional mechanisms between the dnaj proteins atj <dig>  atj <dig> and atj <dig> in regulation of co <dig> fixation might be somewhat different because the j <dig> mutant differed in the response to ambient co <dig> concentration while the j <dig> and j <dig> mutants showed lower response to light intensity, which suggests the involvement of photosynthetic light reactions in limitation of co <dig> fixation. somewhat lower photochemical efficiency of psii, the fv/fm ratio, particularly in j <dig> and j <dig> mutants after the hl treatment refers to malfunction of psii. moreover, the hl treatments of wt and the dnaj mutant plants suggested the involvement of atj <dig> and atj <dig> in stabilization of psii supercomplexes and dimers.

the deduction that these small chloroplast-targeted dnaj proteins are related to regulation of co <dig> assimilation is also supported by the data from dna microarray studies. several genes related to the calvin-benson cycle showed big changes in expression in the dnaj mutants as compared to wt . particularly the expression of ribose 5-phosphate isomerase was significantly downregulated in the mutants under both gl and hl conditions, implying this downregulation as one of the reasons for, or a consequence of, the lower co <dig> assimilation in the mutants. on the contrary, the expression of most genes related to thylakoid membrane proteins was not changed in the mutants, neither under gl nor under hl conditions as compared to wt . the expression of only the fzl-like protein gene was significantly downregulated in j <dig> and j <dig> under gl and in all the three mutants under hl , implying that the fzl-like protein might function in co-operation with the dnaj proteins and control the aggregation/disaggregation of psii complexes since the fzl-like protein regulates the organization of the thylakoid network in chloroplasts  <cit> .

knocking out one of the small chloroplast-targeted dnaj proteins modifies the capacity for dynamic regulation of chloroplast redox reactions
energy distribution between psii and psi is regulated by phosphorylation of the psii-lhcii complexes  <cit> , which in turn is strongly dependent on the redox state of electron transfer components in the thylakoid membrane as well as in the soluble stroma  <cit> . although the differences in psii-lhcii protein phosphorylation between both the three dnaj mutants and the different light intensities did not allow to draw any strict conclusions about energy distribution between psii and psi, it was clearly evident that more phosphorylated thylakoid proteins accumulated in the dnaj mutants, particularly j <dig> and j <dig> during all different short-term illumination conditions . this prompted us to analyse the thylakoid phosphoprotein profiles in the course of long-term hl illumination of both the wt and dnaj mutant plants. indeed, the changes in the phosphorylation pattern of thylakoid proteins revealed the capacity of the electron transfer chain to acclimate to changes in light conditions. wt clearly showed a strong phosphorylation of psii core proteins immediately after exposure to hl, which also reflects a high reduction state of the plastoquinone  pool  <cit> . nevertheless, the dynamics of thylakoid functions allowed re-oxidation of the pq pool in the course of hl illumination and already after  <dig> h this was reflected in lower phosphorylation level of the psii core proteins d <dig>  d <dig> and cp <dig>  j <dig> mutant also had such a capacity to respond to the hl treatment. the j <dig> and j <dig> mutant plants showed clearly less capacity for acclimation of the thylakoid redox reactions to prolonged exposure to hl and kept the psii core proteins strongly phosphorylated during the entire hl treatment, implying highly reduced pq pool. similarly, a more severe stress response of the mutants as compared to wt after prolonged hl treatment can be deduced from the strong phosphorylation of the cas protein, reflecting highly reduced electron transfer chain in all mutants  <cit> . cas protein is a calcium-sensing receptor that was found to be located in the stroma thylakoids of chloroplasts and functions in stress responses and signaling pathways  <cit> .

knocking out any one of the small chloroplast-targeted dnaj protein triggers a global stress response
as discussed above, the knocking out of any one of the three small chloroplast-targeted dnaj proteins atj <dig>  atj <dig> or atj <dig> causes many events in arabidopsis, which are reminiscent of generally known stress responses in plants. the most typical response is the increased tolerance of the mutant plants to oxidative stress induced by hl and mv . it was recently reported that the dnaj family proteins participate in h2o2-induced gene expression matrix in higher plants as well as in yeast and cyanobacteria  <cit> . the results reported here likewise show that the dnaj proteins are involved in ros-induced stress responses in arabidopsis. the gene expression profiles of the dnaj mutants, even under gl conditions, are quite similar to those induced upon ros-producing hl treatment in wt . moreover, the transcripts of some specific antioxidant genes, like apx <dig>  cat <dig>  csd <dig>  gpx <dig>  glutaredoxin-like, were found to be specifically upregulated only in the three small chloroplast-targeted dnaj knockout mutants . such upregulation of ros scavenging and antioxidant systems coincided with lower h2o <dig> content in the dnaj mutants than in wt, both at gl and hl conditions . many genes encoding intracellular redox regulators such as thioredoxins and glutaredoxins with strong impact on stress tolerance  <cit>  were upregulated together with several receptor kinases and g-proteins in the dnaj mutants , implying redox regulation in the stress tolerance of the dnaj mutants. moreover, the expression of a number of genes encoding conventional transcription factors and many novel ones containing zinc-finger, myb, nac and ap <dig> domains, which are tightly correlated with stress responses  <cit> , showed significant modifications in the dnaj mutants even under gl conditions . many of their target genes are likely involved in protein modification and degradation processes, as can be deduced from the mapman analysis . these results strongly indicate that a global stress response has been triggered in the three dnaj mutants even in the absence of external stress.

the comparison of the gene expression profiles of our dnaj mutants with those of other mutants deposited in the public microarray database further supported the idea that the tolerance of the dnaj mutants to oxidative stress induced by mv is due to the trigger of a global stress response in these mutants . the expression of  <dig> genes co-downregulated in the three dnaj mutants is quite similar to that observed for oxidative stress related mutants of arabidopsis, oxt <dig> and over-tapx mutants. oxt <dig> displays more tolerance to oxidative stress  <cit>  whereas over-tapx is a transgenic line which overexpresses the thylakoid-bound ascorbate peroxidase  <cit> . on the contrary, completely opposite regulation of the  <dig> genes was displayed by hsp <dig>  a hsp90-reduced line of arabidopsis showing enhanced sensitivity to high temperature and to pathogen attack  <cit> , and by the csn mutants  <cit> . the most studied csn function is the regulation of protein degradation and beyond this, the csn also acts as a transcriptional regulator  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the functions of the three small chloroplast-targeted dnaj proteins atj <dig>  atj <dig> and atj <dig> seem to be, at least partially, redundant in arabidopsis, yet it is evident that also specific functions exist for each protein. knockout of the atj <dig> protein revealed less drastic influence on photosynthetic parameters than the knockout of either the atj <dig> or the atj <dig> protein. because of the small sizes and the lack of client protein-interaction domains, the multiple, yet subtle, effects on photosynthesis performance induced by the knockout of any one of the small dnaj proteins, atj <dig>  atj <dig> or atj <dig>  makes it hard to distinguish the individual roles of these dnaj proteins in co-chaperone/chaperone cohort. nevertheless, in general, these small chloroplast dnaj proteins participate in optimization of co <dig> fixation, in stabilization of psii complexes and balancing the electron transfer reactions. it is conceivable that the tolerance of the dnaj protein knockout plants to oxidative stress results from an unbalance of the redox reactions in chloroplasts, thereby modifying the chloroplast retrograde signaling mechanisms and inducing the up- or down-regulation of stress responsive genes in the nucleus  <cit> .

as a whole, it can be concluded that both specific- and cross-talk functions exist between the three small chloroplast-targeted dnaj proteins, and the tolerance of the dnaj protein knockout plants to oxidative stress occurs at the expense of the flexibility of photosynthetic reactions. further studies with double and triple mutants are expected to provide stronger phenotypes and also to give deeper insights into the functions of the atj <dig>  atj <dig> and atj <dig> proteins in chloroplasts.
