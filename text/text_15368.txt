BACKGROUND
stearidonic acid  and gammalinolenic acid  are scarce polyunsaturated fatty acids . they act as precursors for a range of physiologically essential highly unsaturated fatty acids , including eicosapentaenoic acid , docosahexaenoic acid  and arachidonic acid . epa and dha function as major animal nutrients, as well as being part of the cytoplasmatic membrane building elements that regulate membrane functions. furthermore, epa and ara together with elongation products of sda and gla, are precursors of other important molecules including the eicosanoids  <cit> . in addition, hufas are of interest because of their important roles in human health and nutrition  <cit> .

it is known that organisms able to synthesize hufas follow two different pathways; the more common aerobic pathway utilizes desaturase and elongase enzymes, while the anaerobic pathway is catalyzed by polyketide synthases  <cit> . the former consists of consecutive elongation and desaturation cycles of the carbon chain. according to the order in which desaturation and/or elongation proceed, several pathway variations exist.

there exists another unusual pathway described in mammals and fish, i.e. the sprecher´s pathway. this route is characterized by a lack of desaturation reaction at Δ4-position, but successive Δ <dig> and Δ6-desaturations of α-linolenic acid , generating a six double bond c <dig> intermediate which is finally shortened by peroxisomal β-oxidation eventually forming dha  <cit> .

mammals, including humans, are poor convertors of the precursors linoleic acid  and ala into hufas; therefore, hufas must be taken up directly as components of the diet  <cit> . the current main dietary source of n- <dig> hufas is fish and other seafood. the fas are initially produced by a plethora of marine microorganisms, which proceed through the food chain and end up in fish  <cit> . unfortunately, the increased demand for fish and fish oils has led to depletion of fish stocks worldwide  <cit> . because of this, fish farming has developed into a highly productive and efficient industry  <cit> . thus, aquaculture and particularly fish production might be the future source of n- <dig> hufas, although it also depends on extractive fishing for producing fish fodder.

in order to obtain a more suitable source for the large-scale production of pufas, searches for new sources of these compounds have been conducted  <cit> . one potential solution is to seek alternative sources of higher plant oils which contain the health promoting c <dig> precursors, sda and gla. it is known however that very few plant species, mainly boraginaceae, onagraceae, saxifragaceae and scrophulariaceae families  <cit>  have the biosynthetic capacity to produce and accumulate Δ6-desaturated fas predominantly in the form of the n- <dig> gla, and in the case of the n- <dig> series, sda. the latter in particular is a very rare fa found in few higher plant oils offering greater interest due to its known medicinal properties. interestingly, sda has not been qualified as equivalent to epa and dha as an essential fa, unlike epa and dha, although it has been shown to possess similar beneficial health properties as the longer chain n- <dig> hufas  <cit> .

consequently, we focused our attention on the echium genus  as a potential source of higher plant oil. the echium genus comprises  <dig> species distributed in various continents, in the canary islands it has a large biodiversity with  <dig> endemic species having been described  <cit> . they constitute one of the largest plant sources of sda and gla  <cit> , as well as offering an attractive n-3/n- <dig> balance.

other reported benefits of a sda and/or gla rich fa profile include their use to control the production of proinflammatory eicosanoids derived from ara  <cit> , and to avoid excessive fatty tissue deposition  <cit> .

it is well known that secondary metabolite production in plants is strongly influenced by meteorological factors  <cit> ; therefore, in vitro plant cultures, especially, the highly differentiated hairy root cultures, obtained after guided infection with agrobacterium rhizogenes, offer an attractive alternative for the stable production and study of natural products including pufas  <cit> .

to the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first example of the establishment of hairy roots for the study and production of pufas, and the first account of a boraginaceae species hairy root culture. here, a detailed study on the establishment of e. acanthocarpum hairy root cultures and their ability to synthesize and accumulate pufas is reported, proving to be a suitable system for the production of n- <dig> and n- <dig> healthy pufas.

RESULTS
characterization of hairy root cultures and growth
the two well-established transformed root cultures  were clones showing a medium growth rate and high stability with regards to their fas production. morphologically the roots of line hr e <dig>  were much thicker, shorter and less branched than those of hr e <dig> . both, slight callus and hyper-hydrated tissue formation were occasionally observed in the hr e <dig>  hairy roots . despite having the insertion of the npt-ii gene, which provides resistance to kanamycin , as determined by pcr  only hr e <dig>  was able to grow in the presence of the antibiotic; regardless of this, the two hairy root lines were investigated.

the growth and fa production were monitored for either  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> days. line hr e <dig>  grew faster and reached its maximum fresh weight  after  <dig> days , although statistical differences were not detected from day  <dig> onwards . on the other hand, hr e <dig>  line grown in the presence or absence of kanamycin, generated similar biomasses to hr e <dig>  , but grew for longer time periods i.e.  <dig> and  <dig> days respectively .

as expected, statistical analysis revealed significant differences between fw values obtained at different sampling points in each culture, describing a typical growth profile i.e. latent phase, exponential phase and stationary phase . nonetheless, no significant differences were observed when comparing the maximum values of fw of the three cultures.

fatty acid profiles. time course of lipid and pufa production
since very little is known about lipid and fa production by transformed hairy root cultures, a preliminary study of the whole lipid composition was conducted. regarding total lipid amounts , no statistical differences were detected among triplicates of different samplings within the same hairy root line. additionally, tl extracted from the two hairy root lines  gave comparable results , hr e <dig>  gave values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg tl/g dw, while hr e <dig>  gave values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg tl/g dw. the major lipid classes were triacylglycerols,  <dig> % and  <dig> % for hr e <dig>  and hre <dig> , respectively, and sterols ester  .

total lipid content and general fatty acid profiles  of two cell lines of echium acanthocarpum hairy roots at sampling points  <dig> and  <dig> cultured in b <dig> nutrient liquid medium at 25°c. n- <dig> and n- <dig> Δ6-desaturation indexes were calculated as 18:3n-6/ and 18:4n-3/, respectively. double bond index was calculated as / <dig>  values are presented as the average of three replicates .

concerning fas production in e. acanthocarpum hairy roots, these compounds were chiefly stored and present in the hairy roots, and very minute amounts were released into the liquid nutrient medium. furthermore, hairy roots were able to accumulate important amounts of fas, in particular the saturated palmitic acid  and stearic acid , together with lower amounts of 20: <dig>  22: <dig> and 24: <dig> . unsaturated fas including oleic acid , 18:1n- <dig>  18:2n- <dig>  18:3n- <dig>  as well as the Δ6-desaturated target fas, γ-linolenic acid  and stearidonic acid , were also observed .

in both hairy root lines, the dominant pufas were 18:2n- <dig> and 18:3n- <dig> in descending order, which accounted for about 50% of total fas . the n- <dig> pufas, 18:3n- <dig> and 18:4n- <dig>  appeared in lower amounts, representing approximately 5% of total fas. other fas were also identified and quantified. the saturated fas  were extracted in relatively large amounts, i.e. 32-38% of total fas; whereas, monoenes only represented about 5-9% of total fas .

effect of hairy root cell line and culture time on fatty acid production - hr e <dig> 
the final fa profiles obtained from hr e <dig>  hairy roots, after  <dig> days of culture, were very similar . statistical analyses over the time-course of the experiment showed temporal changes in the amounts of individual fa present in hr e <dig> . the percentage of 18: <dig> for example was slightly higher in sampling point  <dig>  compared to other time points while 18:1n- <dig> was slightly larger in sampling point  <dig>  . the percentage of 18:2n- <dig> was found to be significantly higher in sampling points  <dig> and  <dig>  . on the other hand, several saturated fas such as, 14: <dig>  20: <dig>  22: <dig> and 24: <dig>  reached different percentages at each sampling, between  <dig>  to  <dig> % for 14:0;  <dig>  to  <dig> % for 20:0;  <dig>  to  <dig> % for 22: <dig>  and  <dig>  to  <dig> % for 24: <dig>  .

the n- <dig> Δ6-desaturation index  which provides information on the proportions of n- <dig> fas within the samples, was also determined for each hairy root line. for hr e <dig> , the ratio was slightly lower,  <dig>  for sampling point  <dig> than for the rest of sampling points  but no statistical difference was found. likewise, the ratios n- <dig> Δ6-desaturation index , which provide information on the proportions of unsaturated n- <dig> fas within the samples, and the dbi , which establishes the richness of unsaturated fas within the samples, were also determined for each hairy root line. again, no statistical differences were observed. .

in this report, fa production studies were carried out taking into consideration both the percentage of each fa, as well as the absolute amounts of these. in relation to absolute values, 18:2n- <dig>  was the most abundant fa, with over  <dig> mg/g dw at sampling points  <dig> and  <dig>  followed by 16: <dig> with  <dig>  mg/g dw at the same sampling points, and 18:3n- <dig> with  <dig>  mg/g dw at sampling point  <dig> . the n- <dig> fas were generally detected in lower amounts 18:3n- <dig> with  <dig>  mg/g dw, and 18: <dig> n- <dig> with  <dig>  mg/g dw at sampling point  <dig> .

effect of hairy root cell line and culture time on fatty acid production - hr e <dig> 
similar results were observed for the hr e <dig>  hairy root cultures, the fa profiles at the end of the experimental period , being only marginally different from those observed from hr e <dig> .

again some temporal changes were noted. for example, in cultures without added kn, 18:3n- <dig>  gave peak percentages at sampling points 1- <dig> and  <dig> with significantly lower percentages being observed at points  <dig> and  <dig>  this was also reflected in a statistically lower n- <dig> Δ6-desaturation index  at these same time points .

apart from this, n- <dig> pufas including ala  and sda  levels were clearly lower than n- <dig> pufas, with the highest ala percentages occurring at sampling point  <dig> , although no statistical differences were detected throughout the experiment. in a similar fashion, sda  levels were slightly elevated at sampling point  <dig> , but no significant differences were detected, the mean values being  <dig> % of total fas throughout the experiment.

the n- <dig> Δ6-desaturation index or  ratio, was lower at sampling  <dig>  with its maximum values being achieved at sampling  <dig> . only a few statistical differences were detected in saturated fas. fas 22: <dig> and 24: <dig> were statistically lower at sampling point  <dig>  while the monoenes 18:1n- <dig> and 18: <dig> n- <dig>  and the saturated fas 16: <dig>  18: <dig>  20: <dig> were statistically similar at all sampling points. similarly, no statistical differences were detected in the dbi index throughout samplings 2- <dig> . in reference to absolute fa amounts, 18:2n- <dig> was again the most abundant, yielding a maximum of  <dig>  mg/g dw  and a minimum of  <dig>  mg/g dw at sampling point  <dig>  this was followed by 16: <dig> ; and 18:3n- <dig>  which displayed a range between  <dig>  mg/g dw  and  <dig>  mg/g dw . as expected, the values for n- <dig> fas were lower, with maximum quantities achieved at sampling point  <dig> for 18:3n- <dig> , and sampling point  <dig> for 18:4n- <dig>  .

when the same hairy root line was cultured in the presence of kanamycin, the fa profile was characterized by a particular abundance of 18:2n- <dig> , and 16: <dig>  showing statistical differences at samplings points 5- <dig> . gla was also abundant in the pool, and accounted for up to  <dig> % of total fas . similarly to the other two hairy root cultures, the percentages of 18:3n- <dig> and 18:4n- <dig> were lower than their n- <dig> cousins  . the maximum value for the monoene 18:1n- <dig> was observed at sampling  <dig> and  <dig>  while the level of the other monoene 18:1n- <dig>  as well as the saturated fas 14: <dig>  18: <dig>  20: <dig> and 22: <dig> were constant throughout the experiments .

according to the preceding data, the ratios  and  reached their maximum values at sampling point  <dig>  , indicating a maximum Δ6-desaturation activity. in reference to dbi , no statistical differences were detected throughout the course of the experiments .

the absolute amounts of fas generated from the hr e <dig>  line with kanamycin maintained the same order as the previous experiments with 18:2n- <dig>  being the most abundant, reaching  <dig>  mg/g dw at sampling point  <dig>  followed by 16: <dig> , and 18:3n- <dig>  . as expected the n- <dig> fas were observed in lower amounts than the n- <dig> fas, reaching maximum values of  <dig>  mg/g dw for 18:3n- <dig> and  <dig>  mg/g dw for 18:4n- <dig> at sampling point  <dig> .

principal component analysis  was also conducted in order to reduce the dimensionality of the fa variables, and to visualize this problem from a two-dimensional point of view. the percentage of each fa variable was considered generating two principal components, pc <dig> and pc <dig>  with a cumulative explained variance of  <dig> %. pc <dig> component  was positively correlated with certain saturated fas  and strongly negatively correlated with 16: <dig>  18:1n- <dig> and 18:3n- <dig> . accordingly, the pc <dig> component correlated with the level of saturation, indicating that a higher value would correspond to more saturated fa profile. furthermore, pc <dig> , was positively correlated with 18:3n- <dig> and 18:4n- <dig>  and negatively related with 18:2n- <dig> . as a result, the new variable pc <dig> was clearly associated with fas of the n- <dig> series, and in general, with polyunsaturated fas.

pca analysis of absolute amounts of fas showed similar results, i.e. the same correlations than in the first analysis. this is probably due to the fact that no significant differences were detected for tl , fresh weight   or for lipid classes .

a two-way anova analysis for both components, pc <dig> and pc <dig> was also conducted. this study showed that the effects of the culture, sampling point, and the interaction of the culture and sampling point, were significant on each component , with a particular emphasis on pc <dig>  which represents an enrichment of n- <dig> fas in the extracted oil. according to the statistical data, the average of the second component pc <dig> categorized by sampling points was found to be strongly intensified between sampling points 1- <dig> for the three cultures . these data were correlated with the  ratio at these days . furthermore, the averages of the pc <dig> component categorized by the combination of the kind of culture and by the sampling points, appeared to be higher in hr e <dig>  and hr e <dig>  with added kanamycin , and correlated with the ratios  and  recorded at these points and in these cultures . in general, hairy root line hr e <dig>  accumulated more n- <dig> desaturated fas, and less saturated ones, reflected by the pc <dig> component . in addition, hr e. <dig> showed similar levels of n- <dig> desaturated fas when these hairy roots were cultured in the presence of kanamycin. nonetheless, the levels of saturated fas were always higher compared to hr e <dig>  line . therefore, the n- <dig> and n- <dig> Δ6-desaturation index were significantly higher in hr e <dig>  and in hr e. <dig> cultured with kanamycin  .

discussion
it has been shown that the establishment of the novel e. acanthocarpum hairy root cultures represents a powerful tool to aid research regarding the accumulation and metabolism of fas. moreover, this is of particular interest given that these plants are an unusual rich source of gla and sda. the attractiveness of using transgenic plants or cultures as green-factories for the synthesis of high value product has been documented  <cit> . the main objective of this work was to assess the utility of this new system with regards to the study of fa metabolism and production. we focused on the production of pufas due to their known health benefits with a particular emphasis on omega- <dig> stearidonic acid , a precursor of valued hufas, such as epa and dha, and n- <dig> gla, a known modulator of eicosanoids derived from ara. furthermore, sda and gla are particularly valuable in view of the fact that the initial Δ6-desaturation of their precursors ala and la, respectively appears to be the rate-limiting step of the entire pathway  <cit> , and that very few plant species are able to further metabolise ala into sda.

although roots are generally considered structural organs providing physical support to maintain the stability of the plant, and appear rich in phospholipids and sterol esters  <cit> , they are also potent biochemical factories, able to biosynthesize and often accumulate a myriad of bioactive secondary metabolites  <cit> , including fas as first reported here.

hairy roots induced by agrobacterium rhizogenes transformation are widely used for the study of metabolic regulation and large-scale metabolic production because, biosynthesis in hairy roots mimics or even improves that of intact roots in the original plants, or intact plants  <cit> . this study constitutes the first report on the induction and establishment of a boraginaceae species hairy root culture for the study of fa production. echium acanthocarpum, together with the other twenty-two canary islands endemic echium species are known as fas containing plants, the majority of which are located in its seeds and leaves  <cit> . nevertheless, the fas content has never been investigated in intact e. acanthocarpum plant roots. in this study, our e. acanthocarpum hairy root system was found capable of growing in an stable and amenable manner, and more importantly, it was able to produce and accumulate a consistent profile of fas including the pufas 18:2n- <dig>  and 18:3n- <dig> .

in order to better characterize the pufas production efficiency of the e. acanthocarpum hairy roots, two cell lines  were cultured under similar conditions. independently of the hairy root line, the most abundant fa was 18:2n- <dig> , whose values were between  <dig> - <dig> %. these values are in agreement with previous reports using intact roots of e. asperrimum , and other boraginaceae roots with  <dig> %  <cit> . the presence of 18:2n- <dig> in the seeds and leaves of e. acanthocarpum has also been reported but in lower amounts  <cit> .

comparison of fatty acids profiles  of hr e <dig>  hairy roots with echium asperrimum roots, e. acanthocarpum seeds and leaves, and transgenic arabidopsis seeds expressing the e. plantagineum Δ6-desaturase gene. n- <dig> and n- <dig> Δ6-desaturation indexes were calculated as 18:3n-6/ and 18:4n-3/ respectively. double bond indexes  were calculated as / <dig>  numbers within brackets indicate reference number.

furthermore, attractive amounts of n- <dig> unsaturated pufas, i.e. ala and sda, have also been reported in this study, the levels of sda being specially interesting as it can serve as a dietary precursor of the valued eicosapentaenoic acid   <cit> . it was noted that the increase in total amount of pufas did not parallel to hairy root growth. maximum production appeared at the early stages or active growth phase of each of the three cultures studied. this might be explained by the increasing amount of actively dividing meristematic root cells and, subsequently by membrane cytoplasmatic formation  <cit> . however, the optimal pufa productivity in this hairy root system was always associated with the highest biomass density during the culture period; therefore, assuming a compromise between fa production and hairy root biomass, it was determined that sampling times 4- <dig> gave the most beneficial fa yields .

furthermore, it is known that seeds are, by nature, specialized storage organs. for example it has been reported that e. acanthocarpum seeds are characterized by  <dig> % of fas   <cit> , 70-80% of which are triacylglycerol , the fraction were the fa pool is mostly present. in addition, it has also been reported that the chloroplast membrane is also able to accumulate a high percentage of lipids, known to accumulate up to 75% of total fas indicating the importance of the aerial chlorophyllic organs in fa production  <cit> . taking this into account, species of plants subjected to a higher solar irradiation would have smaller chloroplast membranes in their leaf cells and subsequently a lower percentage of fa in their leaf oil. accordingly, leaf oil content was higher in european echium species  than in macaronesian echium plants . for the case of e. acanthocarpum, its leaf oil value was  <dig> %, and our hairy root system yielded  <dig> % . here the e. acanthocarpum hairy roots were able to accumulate fas although cultured in the dark which would also hinder the formation of chlorophyllic cells, thus not having a full fa production potential of abundant chloroplast membranes. the data of e. acanthocarpum hairy roots fas appear to be in agreement with the fas content reported in e. asperrimum plant roots although showing lower values in the intact roots of this species   <cit> .

although it is generally accepted that seed represents the best source of gla  <cit> , attractive amounts of fas have been reported in other plant organs such as leaves  <cit> . the Δ6-desaturated 18:3n- <dig> was particularly abundant in the hairy roots, especially in hr e <dig> , with  <dig> %, after only  <dig> days of culture . this is a significant percentage, especially when compared to other natural sources of this fa, such as the ribes sp. seeds   <cit>  or the echium sp. seeds   <cit> . the amount of gla, as a percentage of the total fa content in e. acanthocarpum seeds, was higher than in our hairy roots, correlating with the n- <dig> Δ6-desaturation index . nonetheless, the high relative percentage of gla accumulated by hr e <dig>  is comparable to the values reported for e. acanthocarpum leaves  <cit> , e. asperrimum roots  <cit> , and even arabidopsis seeds overexpressing a e. plantagineum Δ6-desaturase gene  <cit>  .

although the n- <dig> pufas were clearly in lower proportions than the n- <dig> series fas, ala and sda constituted a significant proportion of the total percentage of fa present in both the hre <dig>  and hr e <dig>  in kanamycin presence . metabolically, the presence of low levels of ala in these hairy roots should lead to the reduced production of sda, compared to the larger production of gla, since the levels of the n- <dig> precursor of the same Δ6-desaturase enzyme was not as abundant as the n- <dig> precursor. this could be supported by the n- <dig> Δ6-desaturation index, which was comparable to the examples reviewed in table  <dig>  except for seeds.

in order to reduce the dimensionality of this multivariate problem and investigate a possible correlation between fa profiles, the kind of hairy root line and the different sampling points, a pca analysis with the obtained fa data was conducted. two components were extracted with a cumulative explained variance of  <dig> %. the pc <dig> was positively correlated with the n- <dig> fa variables .

regarding the fa profiles, the majority of the results were similar, showing no statistical differences. the hr e <dig>  cultured without added kanamycin did however show lower n- <dig> fa amounts and lower Δ6-desaturation activity . this could be attributed to the different phenotypes of the roots and the selection pressured ejected by the antibiotic presence, although all hairy roots showed the presence of the npt-ii gene as determined by pcr . furthermore, it has previously been shown that in soybean roots cultured at 22°c, dbi values of lipids increased with time and that other ratios ]/%16:0) significantly declined between  <dig> and  <dig> days  <cit> , in agreement with the pc <dig> component data . similar trends were observed in the middle stages of the same soybean roots but not at the older stages.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that hairy roots of e. acanthocarpum are able to biosynthesize and accumulate a large and consistent range of polyunsaturated fas, including the target gla and sda fatty acids, although the amounts of gla, for example, were less than those described from seeds of the intact plant they are of significance.

current studies are being undertaken to further optimize and establish a more productive n- <dig> pufa e. acanthocarpum hairy root system, by varying other culture conditions i.e. increasing the osmotic pressure of the liquid nutrient medium and lowering the culture temperature , and changing the carbon source from sucrose to glucose. furthermore, transgenic e. acanthocarpum hairy roots over-expressing a Δ6-desaturase gene are also being established in order to further manipulate the biosynthetic route aiming to boost sda yields.
