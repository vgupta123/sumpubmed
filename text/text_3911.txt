BACKGROUND
birnaviruses define a family of non-enveloped bi-segmented double-stranded rna viruses. the birnavirus capsid is made of a unique icosahedral t =  <dig> shell composed of  <dig> trimers of viral protein  <dig>   <cit> . internal to the virion are vp <dig>  which forms a ribonucleoprotein complex with the genomic rna  <cit> , and vp <dig>  the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase , which is found both free and covalently attached to the genomic rna  <cit> . while the smaller segment b has an open reading frame  coding for vp <dig>  the segment a encodes the polyprotein precursor pvp2-vp4-vp <dig>  vp <dig> is a protease that cleaves its own n and c termini off the polyprotein, thus also releasing pvp <dig>  and vp <dig> within the infected cell  <cit> . subsequent serial cleavages at the c-terminus of pvp <dig> upon particle assembly yield mature vp <dig> and several peptides that remain within the virion  <cit> . the crystal structures of subviral particles  of two birnaviruses have been reported  <cit> . the tertiary structure of vp <dig> comprises three distinct domain termed base , shell  and projection . both domains s and p are folded as jelly roll β-barrels, oriented tangentially and radially, respectively, with respect to the icosahedral particle.

the evolution of birnaviruses has to be considered in the context of their wide host range, from vertebrates to arthropods , mollusks  and rotifers . six genetic clusters have been identified in the birnaviridae family  <cit> . three of them define viruses infecting a unique phylum, the vertebrates: the infectious bursal disease virus  infects birds, while the blotched snakehead virus , the infectious pancreatic virus  and its allies infect fishes. the other clusters infect i) insects such as birnaviruses found in dipters, like the drosophila x virus , the drosophila b virus  and the esperito santo virus  which has been discovered in mosquito cells co-infected with dengue- <dig> virus  <cit>  and ii) mollusks such as the tellina virus  <dig>  described from a bivalve  <cit> . birnaviruses from rotifers have not been genetically characterized.

birnaviruses display unique features among double stranded rna  viruses that are shared by positive single stranded  rna viruses such as nodaviruses  <cit>  and alphatetraviruses . the birnavirus vp <dig> capsid protein is structurally similar to the capsid protein of nodaviruses  or alphatetraviruses . also, a structural peptide that permeabilizes membranes and translocates the viral genome or the replication machinery into host cells - named γ peptide in nodaviruses and pep <dig> for ibdv- is found associated to the particle of both noda/alphatetra-viruses and birnaviruses. in both cases, the capsid protein and γ/pep <dig> peptide result from the cleavage of a capsid pre-protein at its c-terminus . birnaviruses and noda/alphatetraviruses also share similar genomic arrangement and replication strategy. the bisegmented nature of the birnavirus genome, with one segment encoding the capsid protein and the second the rna polymerase, is also retrieved in nodaviruses and in some alphatetraviruses. importantly, the rdrp of two +ssrna viruses  formerly related to the tetraviruses – and recently grouped in a separate family, the permutotetraviridae   <cit>  – shares with the birnavirus vp <dig> a unique polymerase motif rearrangement that has been found otherwise only in drosophila a virus and the plant alpha-like virus grapewine virus q. the latter is likely to have evolved independently  <cit> . these polymerases have their catalytic motifs arranged in the permuted order c-b-a in the primary sequence of the palm domain, in contrast to the conventional a-b-c order found in all other viruses and organisms. however, in contrast to birnaviruses, the genome of the permutotetraviruses is mono-segmented with the capsid gene expressed through the synthesis of a subgenomic rna and an additional capsid maturation processing occurring at the n-terminal domain of the pre-protein.

the crystal structures of the ibdv and ipnv rdrp show that it adopts an active site topology that was not previously observed in other polymerases  <cit> .

the birnavirus vpg-linked genome replication strategy, which has been retrieved in many +ssrna viruses including picornaviruses and caliciviruses, is an additional common feature bringing birnaviruses and some other/additional +ssrna viruses together.

host specificity is also a property shared among birnaviruses and noda-, alphatetra- and permutotetraviruses. a growing number of birnaviruses are characterized in insects  <cit> , which constitute the main host phylum of the three +ssrna families . taken together, these observations strongly suggest the existence of an ancient virus lineage leading to these last +ssrna viruses and birnaviruses. however, similarities between the replication enzymes do not match similarities between the corresponding virus capsid maturation processes and genome arrangement, suggesting that re-assortment events occurred, that involved capsid and polymerase genes. the evolutionary links between +ssrna viruses, birnaviruses and the other dsrna viruses therefore constitute a complex issue that may help understanding the distinctive evolutionary pathways used by viruses to diversify and invade new hosts.

in this work, we sequenced the genome of a virus that infects the rotifer brachionus plicatilis and that was previously identified as a rotifer birnavirus  from biochemical and microscopy criteria  <cit> . starting from the rbv sequence, we revisited the evolution of the birnaviridae and their evolutionary affinities with +ssrna viruses using advanced phylogenetic methods.

methods
cloning and sequencing the rbv genome
viral rna extraction, cdna synthesis, dna amplification and cloning in pgem-t easy vector  were carried out as previously described  <cit> . several overlapping clones covering segments a and b were sequenced.

protein sequences of birnaviruses
the genomes of a number of birnaviruses, infecting a wide range of hosts, have been sequenced. birnaviruses possess bi-segmented double-stranded rna  genomes. segment b contains a single open reading frame encoding vp <dig>  an rna-dependent rna polymerase . segment a encodes a polyprotein, pvp2-vp4-vp <dig>  this polyprotein is processed to give the mature capsid protein vp <dig>  a ser/lys protease and a multifunctional protein vp <dig> that interacts with the dsrna to make filamentous ribonucleoproteins. rdrp is the only enzyme conserved in all known viruses  and thus it is often used to estimate virus phylogenies. however, in this work, to study the phylogeny of the birnaviruses, we built and analyzed trees for the four above proteins: vp <dig>  vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig> 

available 3d structures of +ssrna and dsrna virus families
table  <dig> shows a list of all the 3d structures of the rna dependent rna polymerase and capsid proteins for +ssrna and dsrna virus families available in the pdb. we added to this list, viruses for which no 3d structure is available such as t. assigna and e. elaeasa that belong to the permutotetraviridae family and the drosophila a virus which is highly divergent from previously described viruses and which has not been assigned officially to a family yet.

multiple sequence alignment strategy
to build the phylogenetic trees we need multiple sequence alignments of the corresponding proteins. birnavirus protein sequences are sufficiently similar  to be aligned with usual multiple sequence alignment methods. we thus used two state-of-the-art programs: clustal-Ω  <cit>  and mafft l-ins-i  <cit>  which are based on different principles. we only retained amino-acid columns that were identical in both resulting multiple sequence alignments .

by contrast, rdrp and capsid proteins of dsrna and +ssrna viruses exhibit very low sequence similarity and, capsid proteins, for instance, have complex domain organizations in which similar domains are intermixed in a complicated way with distinct domains. therefore obtaining valid multiple sequence alignments can be quite challenging. to overcome this problem we used multiple structure alignments, when available, as a basis for multiple sequence alignments.

we first performed pair-wise structural alignments with vast  <cit> . using these pair-wise structural alignments we computed a multiple structural alignment  that delineated regions that could be superimposed in all the three-dimensional  structures. this defines conserved regions , often termed the structural core, that are characteristic of the protein family fold. when the analyzed 3d structures correspond to remote homologs, mapping the 3d alignment to a sequence alignment is often tricky since a small inaccuracy in the 3d structure superimposition can lead to the assignment of a residue of a sequence with the neighbor of the true corresponding residue in the other sequence. this problem is exacerbated when one is considering the mapping of pair-wise structure alignments to a multiple sequence alignment and the resulting multiple alignment columns may contain residues that are not all equivalent . to circumvent this problem, we made the assumption that the most likely multiple sequence alignment in the neighborhood is the one that locally maximizes the cumulative score for the alignment. we thus performed a local sequence optimization to maximize the blosum <dig> score of the corresponding sequence block by systematically shifting all the sequences by − <dig>  - <dig>   <dig>  + <dig>  + <dig> residues.

to check the significance of these scores, we randomly generated blocks with an identical size using the same sequences. we performed on these randomly generated blocks the above optimization procedure and we recorded the scores. we then fitted a type  <dig>  extreme value distribution on these data using a maximum likelihood estimate function in matlab. this allowed us to verify that the scores we obtained for the original sequence blocks were indeed significant and not solely a consequence of our optimization procedure. this procedure defined a multiple sequence alignment made of a number of blocks with locally optimized scores .

then two cases arose:

 <dig>  the 3d structure of a protein  was not available but its sequence was sufficiently similar to the sequence of one of the proteins whose 3d structure had been solved . we aligned the query sequence with the target sequence using a regular sequence alignment program. it was easy, then, to integrate, by transitivity, this query sequence into the seed alignment, since both alignments had the target sequence in common.

 <dig>  the most difficult case occurred when the 3d structure of the query protein was not known and its sequence did not share a clear similarity with any sequence of the seed alignment. in such a case, we generated for the query protein a multiple sequence alignment with psi-blast  <cit> . this multiple sequence alignment was edited to avoid pairs of sequences with more than 70% identical residues. we then performed an alignment of the previously defined blocks  with the query multiple sequence alignment using a dynamic programming algorithm. gap penalties were chosen such as preventing indels in the blocks. this resulted in an alignment of the blocks on the multiple sequence alignment generated with the query sequence, each block having a particular score. to estimate the reliability of the positioning of the blocks on the query multiple sequence alignment, we shuffled the columns of the latter and realigned the blocks with the resulting multiple sequence alignment. we carried out this shuffling procedure  <dig> times and collected the scores of the aligned block. as above, we fitted a gumbel extreme value distribution on these scores for each block. this allowed us to estimate the significance of the score of each block by computing the probability that a particular block had a score equal to or larger than the observed value, just by chance. we tested the validity of this procedure with the nine rdrps for which the 3d structure is known using a jack-knife, i.e., we selected, in turn, height structures to build the blocks as described above and used the ninth one as a query. this test showed that we were able to correctly predict the position of the blocks along the query sequence for scores having a probability less than  <dig> . on the other hand, we observed false negatives, that is, blocks correctly positioned along the query sequence but having a probability much larger than  <dig> . most of the time, this occurred when the block was located between two other blocks with large and significant scores that constrained the number of available positions for the former block.

all multiple sequence alignments have been deposited in treebase.

phylogenetic analyses
since our proteins are highly divergent, we paid special attention to choosing an appropriate evolution model: we examined site-heterogeneous and branch heterogeneous models in addition to standard ones. this also explains why we considered only likelihood-based  reconstruction methods. we first used prottest  <cit>  to determine the most appropriate evolution model among a set of standard candidates models. we used the bayesian information criterion  to select the model. for all datasets, prottest selected lg + i + g or variations of it . we then compared lg + i + g to various mixtures model tailored to the evolution of divergent proteins. those models are cat <dig>  which assumes that each position belong to one of  <dig> categories, each characterized by a specific stationary amino-acid distribution and structure-based models that assigns positions to one of  <dig> to  <dig> categories, according to the secondary structure of the protein, and use a different substitution matrix for each category. cat <dig> and structure based models account for heterogeneity across sites in a much more specific way than standard rates across sites models.

multiple sequence alignments constructed as above were analyzed using both maximum likelihood  and bayesian inference  methods.

in ml analyses and to mitigate the effect of the starting tree, we used a full spr search strategies with  <dig> random starting trees in addition to the default bionj starting trees. we included a proportion of invariable sites, optimized by the program , and a ras modeled with a gamma distribution with  <dig> categories with shape parameter optimized by the program . for all alignments considered, at least  <dig> of the  <dig> random starting trees led to the same final tree as the bionj starting tree. moreover, this shared tree was always the overall ml tree.

for mrbayes, we used the lg + g + i model, as selected by prottest. we used a gamma-shaped distribution of rates across sites, uniformly distributed on the interval  <cit> ; the proportion of invariable sites was uniformly distributed on the interval  <cit> ; the gamma distribution was approximated using  <dig> categories; all topologies were equally probable a priori; the branch lengths were unconstrained.

structure-based models such as cat <dig>  ex, eho and ex_eho are not implemented in mrbayes and therefore we did not infer topologies using these models under bayesian inference. however, mrbayes allows within site heterogeneity with covarion models. we therefore ran chains under a lg + g + i and covarion model and compared the two models  using bayes factor. the covarion model was not only slower to converge but also rejected by bayes factor . therefore, we only provide results obtained without covarion.

all trees and multiple sequence alignments have been deposited in treebase. .

analysis of recombination events in segments a and b of birnaviruses
we implemented the pdm method proposed by  <cit>  . as other recombination analysis methods, pdm is based on the principle that phylogenetic relationships derived from different regions of a multiple sequence alignment will be similar when no recombination has occurred. in practice, a window of length l is moved along the multiple sequence alignment by increment of Δn positions . at each position, the posterior probability distribution of the tree topologies, conditional to the multiple sequence alignment in the window, is computed. for this purpose, we employed mrbayes, with  <dig>  steps of mcmc and a lg + g + i model. in the absence of recombination, one expects the posterior probability distributions computed from different windows to be similar. this similarity is quantified by the kullback–leibler  divergence between the distributions. in  <cit> , the authors, instead of using the individual tree topologies, first clustered these topologies using a robinson-fould distance, and then computed the posterior probability distribution of the clusters conditional to the multiple sequence alignment in the window. this reduced the dispersion of the posterior distributions, providing more robust results. we exactly followed the procedure described in their paper. we, thus, also implemented the procedure husmeier and coll. proposed for estimating the significance of the observed peaks in the kl divergence plot. however, we found that this procedure clearly underestimated the significance thresholds.

therefore, to estimate empirically the significance of the peaks found in the kl divergence plot we carried out simulations using seq-gen  <cit> . seq-gen is a program for simulating the evolution of nucleotide or protein sequences along a phylogeny, according to a particular model of substitution. we concatenated the multiple sequence alignments for the vp <dig>  vp <dig>  spc, vp <dig> and vp <dig> birnavirus proteins of the eight taxa . starting with each taxon concatenated amino acid sequence, in turn, we generated  <dig> multiple sequence alignments sets using the tree obtained for one of the above windows with mrbayes. this resulted in  <dig> sets of eight 897-amino acid long sequences. since the lg substitution matrix is not available in seq-gen we used the blosum <dig> matrix. for other parameters, such as the proportion of invariable sites, the shape of the gamma rate heterogeneity, etc. we used the values estimated by mrbayes for the selected window. for each of these  <dig> sets, we carried out the kl divergence computations described above and we recorded the height of the maximum peak that was found. this provided us with a non-parametric estimate of the significance thresholds .

RESULTS
sequence of a rotifer birnavirus  genome
the rotifer brachionus plicatilis is commonly cultivated for feeding the fry of marine fish in hatcheries in production tanks. after a population collapse, a virus was detected by electron microscopy and isolated from dying plankton  <cit> . this virus showed the typical features of a birnavirus, with non-enveloped, single-shelled icosahedral virus particles of approximately 60 nm in diameter and displaying a bi-segmented double stranded rna genome with a size of about  <dig> ×  <dig> kilobases. we sequenced the two genomic segments of the birnavirus previously isolated from brachionus plicatilis. the orf present in the larger genomic segment  consists of  <dig> nucleotides  encoding a polyprotein of  <dig> amino acids  sharing 20-30% identity with its birnavirus pvp2-vp4-vp <dig> homologs. no additional orf was evidenced on this segment. the orf in segment b consists of  <dig> nt encoding a  <dig> aa protein displaying 19-29% sequence identity with its birnavirus replicase homologs . rbv thus appears as a new member of the birnaviridae family that is divergent from other birnaviruses infecting vertebrates, mollusks or arthropods .

primary structures of the polyprotein and rna polymerase rbv
on the basis of experimentally characterized cleavage sites in other birnavirus polyproteins, the rbv polyprotein maturation cleavage sites were identified by sequence homologies . the primary cleavage sites at the pvp2-vp <dig> and vp4-vp <dig> junctions may occur between residues 529– <dig> and 773– <dig>  respectively and three additional cleavage sites were predicted in the pvp <dig> c-terminal domain . the predicted peptides have homologs in other birnaviruses. overall, the structure of the vp <dig> s domain appears well conserved, but the length of the β-strands and the loops constituting the p domain appear to be very different when compared to their ibdv and ipnv homologues. the vp <dig> sequences have deeply diverged during birnavirus evolution, suggesting that the structural constraints are less restrictive than for the capsid protein. similarly, only a few residues are conserved between the rbv vp <dig> and other birnavirus vp <dig>  including the catalytic site defined by the serine hydrolase gxs signature . overall, based on sequence alignments, the 3d-structures of vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig> of rbv are expected to be rather similar to their birnavirus homologs.

concerning the rbv vp <dig>  a striking feature of the sequence is the presence of a large c-terminal domain only found in its dxv and esv homologues otherwise, which may suggest a closer proximity of these three viruses. furthermore, the rbv vp <dig> sequence revealed the conservation of the unique c-a-b motif arrangement in the palm subdomain of the rbv replicase, a hallmark that is shared by birnaviruses and the permutotetraviruses  <cit> . this motif rearrangement is a result of a topological relocation of the protein main chain between two internal positions, separated by about  <dig> aa.

thus, the sequences of the rbv proteins identify this virus as a new member of the birnaviridae family with a typical genomic structure, defining a new genetic cluster in this family. using a phylogenetic approach, we undertook a study of the evolutionary links among birnaviruses, including rbv and the birnaviruses recently described from insects.

analysis of potential re-assortment/recombination genomic events
the supermatrix is a common approach to analyse data from multiple genes . it consists in concatenating the individual genes  to form a single supergene  to which usual phylogenetic inference methods are applied. however, this approach assumes that all or at least most of the genes have roughly the same phylogenetic history. this might not always be the case for highly plastic genomes, such as those of dsrna viruses, which are potentially subject to segment re-assortments or recombination events. to test the possibility of genomic rearrangements we concatenated the multiple sequence alignments for proteins of both the a and b segments  in different orders and analysed the resulting multiple sequence alignments for potential recombination breakpoints using pdm  <cit>  as described in methods. figure  <dig> presents the plot of the kullback–leibler divergence for different values of the number of tree topology clusters. peaks in this plot are indicative of the location of possible recombination events. the dotted lines indicate the significance of the peaks. for instance, we determined empirically that 99% of the peaks have a height that is less than  <dig>  if there is no recombination . consideration of figure  <dig>  reveals that the only significant peak is the one located between vp <dig> and proteins of the segment a, here vp <dig>  in other words, it is highly probable that the two segments have been re-assorted in the different lineages resulting in different phylogenetic histories. this was confirmed by an au test  <cit>  of topologies. we inferred topologies ta and tb independently on segments a and b. the au test rejects topology tb for segment a , but not topology ta for segment b . however, it should be noted that the au test is quite conservative. with regard to these results, in the subsequent phylogenetic analyses, we will consider vp <dig> on the one hand and a concatenation of vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig> on the other hand.

selection of an evolutionary model for virus protein evolution
since the phylogenetic analysis of virus proteins may be very difficult due to their fast and extensive divergence, using an appropriate model of amino acid replacement is critical to study rna virus protein evolution and phylogeny. we used prottest  <cit>  to select the best evolution model for our proteins. among the models available in prottest, lg + g + i or variations of it  were selected for all datasets. it consists of the lg amino-acid substitution matrix supplemented with a fraction of invariable sites  and rate heterogeneity across sites  model, modelled with a discrete gamma distribution with four categories. in addition to this model, we explored various models specifically designed for divergent proteins. the first, cat <dig>  <cit>  assigns each position of the alignment to one of  <dig> pre-computed categories. each category is characterized by a specific profile of amino-acid stationary frequencies. within a category, changes are biased towards amino acids with high stationary frequency, so that the amino acids observed at a given position are but a subset of all amino acids. amino acids with high probability within a category often share one or more properties: electric charge, hydrophobicity, aromatic character, etc. however, apart from their specific profiles, all sites share a common substitution matrix: the f <dig>  matrix. the second model, structure  <cit> , is a mixture model where each position is assigned a priori to a category, based on the secondary structure of the protein at that position. all sites of a category evolve according to the same substitution matrix. however and unlike cat, the categories differ not only on their stationary distribution but also on their  substitution matrices. three classification schemes were tested: exposed against buried , extended, helix and other  and a combination of the two previous schemes . the cat and structure models are fundamentally different from standard models included in prottest because they are mixture models: each category has a distinct substitution matrix. in standard models, the only heterogeneity across sites comes from the ras: slow-evolving and fast-evolving positions share the same substitution matrix, up to a scaling factor coming from the gamma distribution. in cat and structure models, no such linkage exists between substitution matrices of different categories. furthermore, cat and structure also include a ras component  and a proportion of invariable sites  to account for different rates of evolution. we compared lg + i + g to cat + i + g and  + i + g using aic and bic. both criteria selected a structure-based  model with a gain of bic per position ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . we therefore performed all subsequent analyses with the ex_eho model. we should however mention that all models inferred the same topology with only slight differences in branches lengths and thus that the results presented below are robust to the choice of an evolution model.

phylogenetic analysis of birnaviruses
given the phylogenetic position of rotifers among the birnavirus hosts, we were interested to get more insight into the affinities of rbv with the other birnaviruses described so far. we thus analyzed the phylogenetic relationships between proteins of segment a  and segment b  for the eight birnaviruses described so far using the selected evolutionary model described above.

phylogeny of segment b 
figures 4a and b presents, respectively, the maximum likelihood tree using phyml and the consensus tree using mrbayes for vp <dig>  both trees are congruent. the partition between vertebrate viruses and other viruses is well supported with, respectively, a bootstrap value  of 87/ <dig> and a posterior probability  of  <dig>  rbv groups with tv- <dig> unambiguously . this group clusters first with the drosophila virus, dbv,  then with the group formed by the second drosophila  and the mosquito  viruses. notice that arthropod birnaviruses do not form a clade. vp <dig> sequences of dxv and esv are very similar . by contrast, the two drosophila virus vp <dig> sequences are very different. they share  <dig> % sequence identity that corresponds to the smallest pairwise similarity of all vp <dig> proteins. this part of the virus tree is congruent with the corresponding host tree. regarding the vp <dig> of vertebrate viruses, the avibirnavirus ibdv always clusters with bsnv, a fish birnavirus . table  <dig> shows the percentages of sequence identity between these three taxa for the four proteins. it is striking that the maximum value is always found for ibdv and one of the fish viruses, whereas the minimum value is usually found for the two fish viruses .

vp <dig>  vp <dig> , vp <dig>  and vp <dig> . the maximum value is shown in bold, the minimum value in italic.

a common characteristic of all the trees we built with mrbayes and phyml is that i) mrbayes is always more certain about the topology than is phyml and ii) distances estimated by phyml are always larger than those calculated by mrbayes . it is known that bayesian probabilities are on average higher than nonparametric bootstrap support values although direct comparison of the two measures is difficult  <cit> . bootstrap is generally thought consistently conservative, as bootstrap proportions tend to underestimate the probability of the clades to be true, especially when this probability is high  <cit> . bayesian inference, as any parametric method, is sensitive to model assumptions. therefore, in the following, we consider that the two measures provide lower and upper bounds of the true value.

phylogeny of segment a 
figures 4c and d displays, respectively, the ml tree and the bayesian consensus tree for the concatenated vp <dig>  vp <dig> and vp <dig> proteins. the two trees differ by the position of dbv that branches, in the ml tree with bsnv with a strong bootstrap support  and in the bayesian consensus tree on the branch joining {ibdv, ipnv} and bsnv with a relatively weak support . as a consequence, the partition between vertebrate and invertebrate viruses is moderately supported in the bayesian consensus tree . indeed, when examining the topology of the five trees with the largest probabilities values , one observes that dbv tends to cluster with: ipnv , tv <dig> , the cluster {tv <dig>  rbv} , ibdv , the tree topology for the other taxa remaining the same . additional file 2: figure s <dig> presents the tree that is obtained after removing the dbv sequence in the vp <dig> multiple sequence alignment. one obtains a single seven-taxon tree with a very large posterior probability . the subtree topology for the invertebrate viruses is congruent with that of their hosts but the subtree topology for vertebrate viruses is incongruent with that of their hosts, the avibirnavirus ibdv clustering with the fish birnavirus ipnv. all branches of this seven-taxon tree are strongly supported with all posterior probabilities greater than  <dig> . therefore, segment a of dbv appears difficult to classify precisely. for instance, in the above bayesian trees, it never clusters with other insect viruses.

evolutionary affinities of dsrna and +ssrna viruses sharing common structural features
as structures of rdrp or capsid proteins have been solved for a number of birnaviruses and +ssrna viruses, we then investigated evolutionary affinities of birnaviruses with +ssrna viruses  using advanced phylogenetic methods and alignments based on structures.

analysis of rdrp proteins
the quasi-canonical rdrps of birnaviruses and the tav/eev viruses  constitute a separate, deeply rooted rdrp lineage that apparently evolved in parallel to all other viral and non-viral rdrps  <cit> . to clarify the origin of this rdrp lineage in the rna virus world, we used all available relevant rdrp 3d-structures to produce structure-based alignments of birnavirus sequences with sequences of the most related +ssrna viruses  and carried out phylogenic analyses. sequences of rdrp proteins are poorly similar. however, the 3d structures of a number of rdrp of +ssrna or dsrna viruses  allowed us to define structurally conserved regions. interestingly, one of the rdrp 3d structures solved is that of the bacteriophage phi <dig> whose host is a prokaryote and thus constitutes a clear outlier with respects to other rdrp proteins. one can thus hope that the conserved regions so defined will be truly characteristic of the rdrp protein family from +ssrna and dsrna viruses. there are  <dig> structurally conserved regions  corresponding to  <dig> residues. most of the identified sequence motifs in rdrps are associated with some of these blocks, e.g., motif g to block  <dig>  motif f to block  <dig>  motif a to block  <dig>  motif b to blocks  <dig> and  <dig>  motif d to block  <dig>  motif e to block  <dig> and motif c to block  <dig> . figure 5a shows the mapping of these conserved regions on the 3d structure of the ibdv rdrp. for viruses whose rdrp 3d structure was not available , we used the alignment scenarios described in the method section. as can be seen on the multiple sequence alignment , we could not align the  <dig> blocks with enough confidence  on the corresponding query sequences, the worst case being the n. capensis ω virus sequence for which only  <dig> blocks could be confidently aligned. hereafter, we will analyze trees with  <dig> species ,  <dig> species  and  <dig> species . in the first two trees we will consider the topology of four groups of species, corresponding to the caliciviridae family, the picornaviridae family, the flaviviridae family and a group labeled “others” that gathers dsrna viruses in the case of the 9-species tree, and dsrna viruses, alphatetra-, permutotetra- and dav viruses for the 12-species tree). for the 13-species tree, the black beetle virus  forms a group of its own.

figures 6a and b presents, respectively, the maximum likelihood tree  and the bayesian consensus tree  for the  <dig> species. both trees are congruent and show a fair support  for the partition {calici, picorna | flavi, others}. the three alternative topologies t1 = {calici, flavi | picorna, others}, t2 = {calici, picorna | flavi, others} which is also the ml tree and t3 = {calici, others | flavi, picorna} have likelihood − <dig> , - <dig>  and − <dig> . an au test with these topologies almost rejects topology t <dig>  but cannot discard topology t <dig> . the bootstrap probabilities of these trees are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  indicating a clear but not significant preference for topology t <dig> . additional file 4: figure s <dig> shows an evaluation, with the program tree-puzzle  <cit> , of the internal branch support of the three possible topologies that can be generated with these four groups using likelihood mapping for visualizing the phylogenetic content of the multiple sequence alignment. the results of tree-puzzle are consistent with the au test.

as expected, 1ujva, being a virus of prokaryote, exhibits the longest branch in all trees.

figures 6c and d presents, respectively, the maximum likelihood tree  and the bayesian consensus tree  for the  <dig> species. the trees are congruent and show a slightly improved support for the same partition as above. the differences in likelihood between the three alternative topologies and results of the au are also improved: t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> have likelihood respectively − <dig> , - <dig>  and − <dig> . the au test rejects topology t <dig>  but not topology t <dig> . interestingly, the bootstrap probabilities of the three topologies are  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  indicating a clear preference for t <dig>  although the difference between t <dig> and t <dig> does not reach significance . the three new sequences group together with the dsrna viruses . interestingly, the drosophila a virus  that has been labeled as a picorna-like virus  <cit> , clusters tightly with the rdrp sequence of the t. assigna virus that is a +ssrna virus belonging to a newly defined permutotetraviridae family  <cit> . in figure 6d, this group further clusters with the birnavirus rdrp, 2pgga. permutotetra-, dav and 2pgga have permuted rdrps whereas all other viruses have canonical rdrps. the tree shown on figure 6d confirm the claim of  <cit>  that permuted rdrps form a separate lineage in the polymerase tree. however, the ml tree of figure 6c does not support this view since 2ppga clusters with the viruses of the alphatetraviridae and cystoviridae families, although with quite an insignificant bootstrap value of  <dig>  indeed, in additional file 6: figure s <dig>  the ml tree for  <dig> species groups together taxa with permuted rdrps as in figure 6d with a bootstrap value of  <dig>  interestingly, the two dsrna viruses  do not form a clade of their own but are clustered with other +ssrna viruses.

additional file 6: figure s <dig> shows bayesian consensus tree for  <dig> species. the most probable tree found in the mcmc simulation has a mere  <dig>  probability and  <dig> trees are necessary to obtain a cumulative probability of  <dig> . an analysis of these trees shows that the nodavirus taxon can branch almost anywhere on the 12-species tree, the resulting 13-species trees having similar small posterior probabilities. in the bayesian consensus tree, the preferred position for the noda taxon is on the branch joining the clusters {others, flavi} and {calici, picorna}. the ml tree obtained with phyml is congruent with the bayesian consensus tree and shows weak support for the ml topology . the au test, as for the two datasets above, rejects topology t <dig> and keeps t <dig> and t <dig> 

analysis of capsid proteins
we conducted a similar phylogenetic analysis on the capsid proteins of the same viruses, when possible. table  <dig> shows the list of available capsid protein 3d structures of dsrna and +ssrna viruses in the pdb. preliminary results  for the nucleocapsid of the bacteriophage phi <dig> suggest that the birnavirus capsid protein has no equivalent in the bacteriophage phi <dig> genome  <cit> . low resolution 3d structures of the capsid of viruses from the flaviviridae family  <cit>  tend to indicate that proteins involved in building the capsid have no evolutionary relationship with birnavirus vp <dig> proteins. as for rdrp proteins, we carried out pair comparisons of the seven available structures of capsid proteins , generated a multiple structure alignment from which we obtained a multiple sequence alignment as described in the method section. this resulted in a multiple sequence alignment having eight blocks  and a total length of only  <dig> residues . we then tried to align these blocks on the sequences of the capsid proteins for which no 3d structure was available . for dav and for t. assigna virus, respectively, no block and one block could be significantly aligned with a probability <  <dig> . therefore, we only built the phylogenetic trees for the seven species whose capsid 3d structure was available. figures 7a and b presents the ml tree obtained with phyml and the consensus tree obtained with mrbayes. the bayesian consensus tree shows a clear partition {others, noda | calici, picorna}. the topology is well supported with large posterior probability values. the ml tree is almost similar, but the virus of the caliciviridae family branches among the viruses of the picornaviridae family .

discussion
in this work, we determined the full-length genomic sequence of a virus previously identified from the rotifer branchionus plicatilis as a birnavirus on the basis of morphological features. both genomic organization and protein sequences encoded by orf definitely confirm that rbv is a typical birnavirus, thus adding a seventh genetic cluster to the birnaviridae family. rotifers are small zooplanktonic animals from fresh- and seawater, characterized by a ciliated anterior corona used for locomotion and food gathering, and a pharynx with a complex system of jaws. their large population size and high turnover rate make rotifers an important component of food webs since they are eaten by invertebrate predators and fish fry. interestingly, the taxonomic affinities of these species remain controversial despite long standing efforts. a recent global phylogenetic analysis of metazoa based on large sample of est and genomic sequences showed that rotifers – together with gastrotrichs and gnatostomulids – group with platyhelminthes more than with any other stable groups of animals and placed them among the lophotrochozoa  <cit> . the presence of a birnavirus in a rotifer therefore extends significantly the host range of this viral family to a fourth phylum in addition to mollusks, arthropods and chordates. thus, we conducted a study to confront the tree of birnaviruses with the tree of their hosts.

our analysis showed clearly that the birnavirus segments a and b followed different evolution pathways, due to likely re-assortments. it is worth mentioning that within ipnv strains, segments a and b re-assortment has been evidenced in wild fish  <cit>  and that for ibdv, expansion of the very virulent strains has been postulated being associated to segment b re-assortment in the late 1980s  <cit> . independent analysis of proteins encoded by segments a and b therefore produced trees of viral sequences, which we compared to the tree of the host species. while virus protein trees are generally well congruent with the host species at the phylum level, discrepancies appear in the detailed structure of the branch within phyla, possibly reflecting specific adaptations of host-pathogen interactions. thus, neither segment b nor segment a analyses led to a tree compatible with the structure of the vertebrate phylum, since the avibirnavirus ibdv always clustered with one of the fish birnaviruses. similarly, within arthropod birnaviruses, the dbv sequence does not classify at all according to host taxonomy: for segment b, it constitutes a single branch that does not group with the sequence of the two other insect birnaviruses, while for segment a it even falls in the vertebrate birnavirus cluster. these observations would indicate that birnaviruses host specificity may be less narrow than what is observed with avian birnaviruses  and may contribute to re-assortment between phylogenetically distant birnaviruses. genome characterization of new birnaviruses, specially infecting insects and invertebrates may help understanding re-assortment plasticity in birnavirus genomes.

to further investigate the origin of the birnavirus lineage and of its bipartite rna double-stranded genome, we carried out a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of protein regions selected from 3d-structure conservation, for both capsid and rdrp of rna viruses. in the early nineties, koonin and dolja proposed hypothetical evolutionary scenarios for +ssrna viruses based primarily on a tentative phylogeny of the rdrps and also on the gene order conservation in the different genomes  <cit> . the phylogeny analysis was based on multiple sequence alignments of relatively short functional motifs and the generation of the trees was carried out with distance  and parsimony methods implemented in the phylip package  <cit> . a couple of years later, zanotto et al.  <cit>  showed that the sequence similarities and phylogenetic signal were insufficient to support many of the proposed evolutionary groupings of rna viruses. almost two decades later, the 3d structures of a number of rdrps and capsids from different dsrna and +ssrna virus families are now available . computational molecular evolution techniques have also significantly progressed with the introduction of new approaches based on nucleic acids and amino acids’ substitution models that integrate powerful statistical techniques such as maximum likelihood or bayesian methods to evaluate the likelihood of the data given the model parameters or the posterior probability of the generated trees. it thus seemed timely to us to try re-assessing the evolutionary relationships between the dsrna and +ssrna virus families whose rdrp 3d structure is available. our goal was to use these 3d structures to obtain reliable multiple sequence alignments comprising more residues than the ones based only on sequence alignments.

the combination of robust sequence alignments based on 3d structure alignments and the use of advanced phylogeny techniques, in particular site-heterogeneous evolutionary models, allowed us to overcome the difficulties due to the very divergent sequences in the different virus families  <cit>  and to obtain a more precise picture of the relationship between families of +ssrna and dsrna viruses. we also carried out tests with models of heterotachy but they provided less convincing results in terms of likelihood of the trees . although the sh test cannot distinguish topologies t <dig> and t <dig> at a 5% significance level, several lines of evidence indicate that the t <dig> topology that groups {others, flavi-} and {picorna-, calicivirus} is the more likely. we must emphasize that the sh test is well known to be extremely conservative.

trees in figure  <dig> and additional file 6: figure s <dig> tend to confirm the claim of  <cit>  that viruses with permuted rdrps belong to a common evolution lineage. we believe that the topology shown in figure 6c which clusters the birnavirus taxon with viruses of the alphatetraviridae and cystoviridae families  is an “accident”. ml methods single out the best tree. it might exist other trees with slightly different topologies that are equally good in terms of likelihood, i.e., whose likelihood value is not significantly smaller than the best one. notice also that phylogenetic methods do not take into account the fact that rdrps of the birna-, permutotetra- and drosophila a viruses share a common rare evolutionary event, namely the permutation of the functional abc sequence motifs that involve a local rearrangement of the polypeptide chain. however, this relative uncertainty in precisely classifying the birnavirus taxon certainly reflects a true phenomenon. birnaviruses, according to their rdrps, are evolutionary closer to dav and permutotetraviruses than to alphatetra- and cystoviruses. in contrast, judging from their capsid protein, birnaviruses appears closer to the alphatetra- and nodaviruses . it would have been interesting to confirm  this point by including the capsid sequences of the dav and permutotetraviruses in the analysis but, as explained above, we were not able to obtain convincing alignments for these virus proteins. also, birna-, noda- and alphatetraviruses share the same bipartite genome organization whereas dav and the permutotetraviruses have a monopartite genome organization . therefore, birnaviruses appear to be intermediary between noda- and alphatetraviruses on the one hand and permutotetraviruses and dav on the other hand although they are unique in having an rna double-stranded genome. inspection of the trees in figures 6c and d reveals that the dsrna viruses do not form a clade, they are intermixed with +ssrna viruses. the transition between dsrna and +ssrna  does not give the impression of being a rare evolutionary event . this might explain, in part, the surprising observation that there exist two birnaviruses in drosophila  that do not seem closely related, neither considering segment a nor segment b. one could hypothesize that new birnaviruses are created by associating an rdrp, as segment b, from a virus of the permutotetraviridae family or a similar family  and a segment a belonging to a nodaviridae, an alphatetraviridae or another similar family. our finding that segments a and b have different evolutionary histories offers support to this hypothesis. of course, this scenario requires an explanation of how the monopartite genome of the permutotetraviridae family would be split so as to only keep the part corresponding to the rdrp molecule as segment b. gibbs and colleagues have suggested that dsrna replicons from plant might have evolved from a single-stranded rna virus lacking the coat protein  <cit> . it has been shown that the lack of a coat protein affects the balance between viral positive-sense and complementary-sense rna strands . however, the precise mechanism by which the newly created birnavirus eventually would acquire a double-stranded genome remains elusive.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we have analyzed the evolutionary relationship among birnaviruses of a wide range of hosts. we showed that segments a and b are very likely to have been re-assorted in this family and thus have a different evolutionary history. using these two segments, we also showed that there is a good correlation between the phylogeny of the viruses and that of the hosts at the phylum level. however, the situation is much less clear when one studies evolutionary relationships within the phyla. this is the case for vertebrate viruses in which the avibirnavirus alternatively clusters with one of the two fish birnaviruses. this is also the case for arthropod viruses in which dbv, one of the two known birnaviruses of drosophila, displays a very peculiar behavior.

using x-ray structures of rdrp and capsid proteins to obtain reliable multiple sequence alignments and employing “up-to-date” phylogenetic methods, we revisited the pioneering work of koonin and dolja  <cit>  in which they attempted to investigate the evolutionary relationships between +ssrna and dsrna virus families. this allowed us to obtain a more reliable picture of the evolutionary affinities between a number of viruses of the +ssrna and dsrna families.

unraveling the +ssrna and dsrna virus evolutionary history is a complex undertaking since their genomes are subject to different rearrangements: recombination events between members of the same virus families, exchanges of segments for genomes with a multipartite organization, acquisition and loss of genes. genome organizations for these viruses have been framed by both vertical and horizontal flows of genetic information. as suggested by koonin and dolja  <cit> , they consist of a limited number of building blocks, the most universal ones being the set of genes coding for i) the rna-dependent rna polymerase that is the only protein conserved in all viruses and ii) the coat protein. recently, the 3d structure determination of a number of virion architectures has revealed unsuspected similarities between the coat proteins of different viruses  <cit>  that could further help in sorting out the relationship between viruses from different families.
