BACKGROUND
l-ornithine  is a non-protein amino acid that acts as an intermediate metabolite in the urea cycle  <cit> . it plays a significant role in humans, and is used for the treatment of the liver diseases, to strengthen the heart function, for weight loss and to boost immunity. based on these versatile advantages, l-orn is widely applied in the health care and pharmaceutical industries. thus, this field has attracted considerable attention due to the enormous market  <cit> .

to the best of our knowledge, chemical synthesis, fermentation and enzymatic synthesis are the main methods used for the preparation of l-orn. chemical synthesis is one of the earliest methods; its drawbacks include the complex synthesis process and high cost, which have resulted in its gradual elimination  <cit> . despite its low cost, the fermentation method also has several disadvantages; specifically it is difficult to separate the product from the fermentation broth due to the complex composition and because back mutations of the strains are extremely common  <cit> . in contrast, the enzymatic synthesis method exhibits in several areas, including its facile operation and easy purification. moreover, the emergence of immobilized enzyme technology has contributed to its development as an economically and ecologically available biocatalyst method. therefore, the enzymatic synthesis method is highly applicable to l-orn preparation  <cit> .

as the raw material to synthesize l-orn, l-arginine , which is able to be produced by a mature and applicable technology, can be catalyzed by arginase . arginase is a key enzyme in the urea cycle, and catalyses the formation of urea in the mammalian liver  <cit> . arginase is regarded as a prospective pharmaceutical in the near future for use in the enzymotherapy of certain types of cancers that are auxotrophic for arginine; additionally, arginase is being developed used as a bioanalytical implement to monitor arginine levels in the blood  <cit> . currently, arginase is mainly extracted from animal livers and exhibits low recovery, high cost and viral contamination  <cit> . bacteria such as bacillus caldovelox, bacillus anthracis, helicobacter pylori, bacillus thuringiensis and bacillus brevis are another sources of arginase . however, these sources of arginase are inclined to form inclusion bodies and difficult to purify. therefore, we employed the more efficient and facile pichia pastoris  expression system in our work.

first, a suitable expression system was required to obtain abundant and easily purified arginase. due to the impure product obtained using the e. coli expression system and the high cost and strict culture conditions of mammalian cell expression systems  <cit> , we selected p. pastoris as the host for the secretory expression of the recombinant human arginase Ι  in this work. the advantages of this system include the opportunity to obtain large amounts of protein and a purification process that is fairly simple and straightforward. second, the free enzyme exhibited a high level of activity, selectivity and specificity and a lack of long-term stability, recovery and recyclability, which hampered its application  <cit> . this problem appears to have been solved by the advent of immobilization technology. out of the many carriers that have been considered and studied for fixing enzymes, chitosan was of interest because it provided most of the characteristics that we needed. this natural polysaccharide possesses many superiorities, such as high affinity for proteins, biodegradability, mechanical stability and diversity of geometrical configurations; moreover it was fairly suitable for the chosen biotransformation matrix  <cit> . subsequently, we investigated a method for preparation of chitosan particles and a fixation procedure for arg Ι. the optimal conversion conditions were systematically explored, and the reusability of the immobilized enzyme was also tested under these optimum conditions.

RESULTS
arg i optimization and synthesis
the arg Ι sequence is 1032 bp in length, and encodes a protein of  <dig>  kda. the coding region, apart from a 6 × his--tag, was modified based on the codon usage bias of p. pastoris and synthesized by overlapping pcr  <cit> . then, the synthetic fragment was cloned into the phbm905a vector as a fusion protein with the mf-alpha leader sequence for secretory expression. the recombinant plasmid was named phbm905a-arg Ι.

expression and identification of arg i
the recombinant plasmid phbm905a-arg Ι was transformed into p. pastoris gs <dig>  the positive transformant, which selected from the md plate and verified by whole-cell pcr using primers arg- <dig> and arg- <dig> , was used for the expression of human arginase i. first, western blotting with anti-6 × his antibody was used to confirm that the main band of approximately 38 kda was arg i . identical amino acid sequences were obtained from this band by maldi-tof-ms identification , confirming that the recombinant protein was human arginase i.table  <dig> primers used in this study for pcr

the results shown in fig. 1a represent the supernatants collected from the shake-flash culture every 24 h and separated by <dig> % sds-page. the yield of the recombinant protein increased to reach a peak of ~121 mg/l at 144 h, after which it declined with the increasing induction time.

high-density fermentation was applied to the protein to further enhance the expression quantity. when the od <dig> of the culture reached  <dig>  the supply of glycerol stopped, and methanol was added to initiate the induction process. the cell wet weight increased from 180 g/l during phasing to 456 g/l at the end of methanol induction. as shown in fig. 1b, the expression yield of arg i reached a maximum concentration of ~1510 mg/l after 84 h of induction. compared with the shake-flash culture, the expression quantity via high-density fermentation increased by approximately 12-fold.

moreover, the expression quantity of recombinant human arginase i in our work was greatly improved compared with other recombinant human arginase i systems, such as bacillus subtilis  <cit> , escherichia coli  <cit>  and saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> .

purification of arg i
despite its high expression quantity, the activity of the product was restrained; therefore, the enzyme was purified using a series of methods, including ultrafiltration and ni2+-affinity chromatography, to relieve the inhibition of the culture medium  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig> and fig. 1c, the specific activity of arg Ι significantly increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  u/mg after purification and the activity yield of the target protein was raised to 328 %. this result indicated that the elimination of inhibitors, including purines, pyrimidines, lysine, ornithine and urea, could increase the activity and we have successfully obtain the pure protein  <cit> . therefore, a high quantity of arg Ι with superior purity could be synthesized using our method.table  <dig> purification of arg from 200 ml of fermentation supernatant



immobilization yields
because immobilization yields are a critical parameter in immobilization technology, a series of experiments were designed to detect them. the amount of immobilized protein was determined by subtracting the protein recovered in the supernatant from the protein subjected to immobilization. the immobilization yields were calculated as the ratio of immobilized protein to the protein subjected to immobilization. we get the results that adding 5 g  cross-linking particles to 50 ml,  <dig>  mg/ml fermentation supernatant,  <dig>  % of the enzyme would be rinsed out. that is to say about  <dig>  % of the enzyme was immobilized on the chitosan.

effect of temperature and ph on free and immobilized arg i
considering that free arg Ι exhibits a lack of long-term stability, recovery and recyclability that limits its further application, a crosslinking method for the immobilization of arg Ι by chitosan was employed here to improve its stability. the results of the activity of both free and immobilized arg Ι at different temperature and ph conditions are shown in fig. 3a and b. the activities increased and then decreased with increasing temperature and ph values; the maximum values were achieved at 40 °c and ph  <dig>  additionally, the relative activity of the immobilized enzyme was considerably higher than the soluble enzyme at temperatures higher than 50 °c, which suggests that immobilization of arg Ι contributed to its temperature stability. moreover, the soluble arg Ι exhibited more than 60 % activity from ph  <dig> to  <dig>  whereas the immobilized enzyme displayed the most activity from ph  <dig> to  <dig>  this result indicates that the immobilized enzyme had a higher adaptability to ph compared to the free enzyme.fig.  <dig> effect of the temperature and ph on the free and immobilized arg i. a relative activity of the free and immobilized enzymes at different temperatures ranging from  <dig> to 70 °c; b relative activity of the free and immobilized enzymes with different ph values ranging from  <dig> to 12; for both the free and the immobilized enzymes in  and  the maximum activity was taken as 100 %



stability of the free and immobilized arg i
both the thermal and long-term stability, which are the most important parameters for the measurement of the practicability of enzymes, of the free and immobilized arg Ι are illustrated in fig. 4a and b, respectively. the immobilized enzyme retained more than 85 % of its activity after incubation for 240 min at 40 °c, whereas the free enzyme lost approximately 30 % of its activity. moreover, free arg Ι was severely attenuated and nearly inactivated when the temperature rose from  <dig> to 70 °c. in contrast, the immobilized enzyme maintained more than 20 % of its activity at the high temperature. in view of these results, the immobilized arg Ι presented remarkable enhancement in terms of thermal and long-term stability compared with the free enzyme, which is meaningful for future industrial applications.fig.  <dig> effect of the temperature on the stability of the free and immobilized arg i. a immobilized enzyme was incubated at  <dig>   <dig> and 60 °c for 0–220 min; b free enzyme was incubated under the same conditions as the immobilized enzyme; the residual activity was determined at 40 °c, ph  <dig>  in both figure  and  the activity of the enzyme at 0 min was taken as 100 %



optimal conditions for bioconversion
next, we carefully investigated the application of immobilized arg Ι to catalyse l-arg into l-orn. based on the series of experiments described above, the immobilized arg Ι was utilized to synthesize l-orn under the optimal conditions of 40 °c and ph  <dig>  to further improve the conversion rate, the concentrations of glutaraldehyde and mn2+ and the reaction time were systematically studied . according to the results from fig. 5a, there was no significant change in the activity of the immobilized arg Ι when the glutaraldehyde concentration increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  %. this result indicates that 1 % glutaraldehyde might provide sufficient aldehyde groups on the surface of the support that are able to bind the enzyme  <cit> . the influence of the mn2+ concentration on the conversion efficiency is presented in fig. 5b; the best result was obtained with the use of 1 mm mn2+. finally, we determined that 200 g/l l-arg was continually catalysed into l-orn and reached a peak value close to 100 % after 12 h .fig.  <dig> conversion conditions of the immobilized arg i reaction. a relative activity of the arginase catalytic reaction following fixation by chitosan cross-linking with different concentrations of glutaraldehyde , taking the activity of the concentration of 1 % as 100 %; b the influence of the concentration of mn2+ in the reaction on the relative transformation efficiency; c the influence of reaction time on the conversion rate; d operational stability of immobilized arg i. all of the reactions were performed at 40 °c and ph10



reusability of arg i
apart from the high thermal and long-term stability, the immobilized arg i also possessed high operational stability in a batch reactor. the results in fig. 5d illustrate that the activity remained at more than 50 % of its initial value after 36 cycles. therefore, the half-life of the catalyst was determined to be 36 cycles. the results demonstrate the high operational stability of immobilized arg Ι.

identification and transformation quantification of l-orn
lc-ms measurement was applied to identify the biotransformation product . the major peak at  <dig> is the molecular ion  + that confirms that the complex is l-orn. additionally, hplc analysis was employed to quantify the l-orn content . using the blank control in fig. 6b as a reference, we can determine that the l-orn peak appears at  <dig>  min and that the l-arg peak appears at  <dig>  min. based on a series of peak areas of standard samples, the l-orn content could be calculated as  <dig>  g/l and the conversion rate was  <dig>  %. thus, our method achieved a better result compared with previous reports of analogous works  <cit> .fig.  <dig> analysis of biotransformation production. a identification of l-orn in the biotransformation by lc-ms; b hplc analysis of the product of the reaction



CONCLUSIONS
in our study, we report the development of a superior method for the expression of a high quantity of arg i and a highly efficient immobilization method to produce high-quality l-orn.

we employed the pichia pastoris secretory expression system to express arg i and the expression yield of it was as high as ~1510 mg/l. with ultrafiltration and ni2 + -affinity chromatography these two steps, the specific activity of arg Ι significantly increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  u/mg and the recovery of enzyme activity raised to 328 %. compared with other expression method, this has been a huge boost. the immobilized arg i has been used to catalyze the conversion of l-arg to l-orn under an optimal condition of 1 % glutaraldehyde, 1 mm mn2+, 40 °c, ph <dig> and l- arg concentration of 200 g/l, achieving a highly converted content of  <dig>  g/l l-orn and a molar conversion of 98 %.

the results suggest that the p. pastoris expression system may be a suitable choice for high levels of expression of various types of proteins and can offer a more facile and efficient method to obtain pure arg i. the technology of immobilizing enzymes on chitosan will be developed as an economically and ecologically available biocatalyst method.
