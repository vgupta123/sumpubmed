BACKGROUND
malaria continues to be a major health problem and a leading cause of child mortality of the inter-tropical regions despite extensive research efforts. the present situation is also increasingly complicated by the emergence of parasite resistance to multiple drugs much more rapidly than the development of novel anti-malarials. a major obstacle in devising new control tools is our limited knowledge of basic parasite biology and the paucity of identified potential intervention targets. plasmodium species are obligate intracellular protozoan parasites that undergo a number of developmental stages in the vertebrate host and the invertebrate vector. during the last decade, several studies strongly indicated that protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation processes, governed by kinases and phosphatases respectively, play a central and essential role in plasmodium cell cycle and developmental regulation  <cit> .

in plasmodium falciparum , the most deadly apicomplexan parasite, efforts have begun for an examination of the biological roles of protein kinases and phosphatases and their potential as drug targets. in this context, biochemical and cloning studies have reported enzymatic activities and the genes of catalytic subunits related to plasmodial phosphatases. these include pfpp1c, pfpp2a, pfpp2b and pfpp2c, which have been shown to be highly conserved during evolution, suggesting an essential role for these enzymes . with respect to the pf protein phosphatase type  <dig> catalytic subunit or pfpp1c, it cannot be considered per se as a suitable drug target . indeed, complementation studies showed that pfpp <dig> was able to rescue yeast mutated in pp <dig>  <cit> . in p. falciparum functional studies suggested that its activity predominates over the other phosphatases in blood parasites  <cit> . finally, phenotypic pfpp <dig> gene knockdown and the use of phosphatase inhibitors indicated that it seems to be essential for parasite asexual development in erythrocytes  <cit> . at this stage, it is important to note that free pp1c seems to be toxic for the cell  <cit>  but a considerable number of proteins interacting with pp1c have been reported that direct the localization, specificity and the level of its activity in yeast and higher eukaryotic cells  <cit> . indeed, about  <dig> proteins have been shown to physiologically interact with pp1c, constituting a ‘pp1c platform’ that provides a framework offering diverse functions to this enzyme in cell division, transcription and apoptosis for instance  <cit> . structural and functional studies revealed that the interaction of regulators with pp <dig> involved several binding sites, including mainly the so-called rvxf and silk motifs  <cit> . the most studied binding motif is the rvxf for which it has been established a first short consensus sequence as x0-1{p} where x could be any amino acid and {p} any amino acid except p  <cit> .

the importance of these proteins in the regulation of pp <dig> activity in vitro and in vivo prompted us to identify the regulators of pfpp1c and to address their functions. our initial focus based on the completion of the pf genome and the delineation of known pp <dig> regulators has revealed the existence of four conserved regulators. so far, three gene products, pf leucine rich repeat  <dig> , pf inhibitor  <dig>  and pf inhibitor  <dig>  have been thoroughly explored to define their functions in this parasite. biochemical and structure-activity relationship studies demonstrated that these regulators indeed bind to pfpp <dig>  in these studies, we showed that p. falciparum pp <dig> is submitted to a control of its activity by pflrr <dig> , inhibitor- <dig>  and - <dig>  with substantial differences compared to the human orthologs for inhibitor  <dig> and  <dig> . pfi <dig> exhibits an inhibitory role on pfpp <dig> activity, the short rvxf binding motif, not present in human i <dig>  a secondary fxxx binding motif and a peptide sequence 30 % shorter than its human homolog. pfi <dig>  although it contains the rvxf consensus motif, does not seem to be an inhibitor but rather an activator of pfpp <dig> in vitro and is unable to complement i <dig> deficient yeast, suggesting a specific role for pfi <dig> on pfpp <dig>  in p. falciparum, our reverse genetic analyses suggest that pfi <dig> as well as pfi <dig> are essential for parasite growth. further, nmr analysis showed that the main domain of pfi <dig> binding to pfpp <dig> is within residues p39-w <dig>  the mutation of the rvxf motifs in both proteins significantly affects the binding to pp <dig>  finally, peptides derived from these binding motifs have been shown to inhibit p. falciparum growth in vitro  <cit> .

these observations underscore the importance of pp <dig> regulators and promote an increased interest to identify p. falciparum pp <dig> interacting proteins . in the present work, biochemical approaches, yeast two-hybrid screens and in silico analysis were used to define the pips that are the starting point to elucidate pp <dig> interaction networks in p. falciparum and to provide new pathways for further studies to reveal potential targets for specific pharmacological intervention.

RESULTS
identification of pips by affinity/mass spectrometry
in order to identify pips expressed by p. falciparum, affinity purification on pfpp <dig> followed by mass spectrometry was carried out. in this approach, soluble extracts from blood stage parasites cleared as described in materials and methods were incubated with pfpp <dig> covalently bound to sepharose beads. the eluate was separated by sds-page and the proteins detected by coomassie blue staining were identified by ms-ms. as shown in table  <dig>  only  <dig> p. falciparum proteins were clearly identified based on the number of peptides analysed and the corresponding mascot scores for each protein . the identified proteins, ornithine aminotransferase, gapdh and phosphoethanolamine n-methyltransferase contained the motifs ktvkf, klvsw and riif respectively, which comply with the rvxf consensus sequence, while pfhsp <dig> and pf disulfide isomerase have only one putative fxxx motif . sequence analyses of pfhsp <dig> showed  <dig> potential binding motifs rlvnf and fkrknr which correspond to rvxf and fxxx motifs respectively, supporting a direct interaction. however, it could not be excluded that this interaction may be related to the chaperone functions of hsps. hence, it would be necessary to further dissect the role of hsps on the function of pp <dig>  previous studies reported that pp <dig> interacts with murine and human hsp <dig>  <cit>  which are in agreement with the above data. further, amino acid sequence analysis of pfhsp <dig> showed 70 % identity with mouse and human hsp <dig> and  <dig> potential binding motifs, however only the binding motif fxxx is present in the latter . overall, the above approach led to the detection of a low number of direct or indirect pips when compared to the high number of reported regulators/substrates of pp1c in other species. the low recovery by the affinity/mass spectrometry analysis could be attributed to several factors including the presence of very few free pips in parasite extracts, their low solubility in buffers suitable for affinity column and/or the competition between pips.table  <dig> pips identified by affinity chromatography/mass spectrometry

yeast two hybrid screening of a pf cdna library
to further detect additional pips in p. falciparum, a cdna library was screened in a yeast two hybrid  system using full-length pfpp1c as bait and clones growing on high stringency selection media to reduce the number of false positive clones. five independent screens yielded  <dig> clones from a total of  <dig>  ×  <dig> clones screened. after sequencing, all clones showed open reading frames encoding pf genes with  <dig> clones in frame with gal4ad and  <dig> clones out of frame. amino acid sequence comparison revealed that  <dig> proteins in frame with gal4ad were also found among the out-of-frame clones. these data are in agreement with an earlier observation indicating that out-of-frame proteins could be considered as valid interactors in y2h screening  <cit>  and with recent results suggesting that translational frameshift could be means for yeast to reduce the level of expression of exogenous proteins in order to grow on selective media. indeed, this was observed with dhfr where most of isolated clones were not in frame with gal4ad. in addition, this work showed that a reduction of growth rate of yeast was observed when the screening was carried out with dhfr fused in frame with gal4ad  <cit> . consequently, the gal4ad in frame and out-of-frame clones were included in our analysis. in total, sequences identified from  <dig> clones represented  <dig> different proteins  of which  <dig> were obtained more than once with  <dig> clones for pf3d7_ <dig> and  <dig> clones for pf3d7_ <dig> . analysis of the sequences revealed that hsp <dig>  was isolated by y2h screens, reinforcing the idea of its interaction with pfpp <dig> that we observed using parasite extracts and a pfpp <dig> affinity column. this supports the interaction of hsp <dig> with pp <dig> and suggests that besides its chaperone function it may control pp <dig> activity and/or regulate its binding with other partners. the y2h screens also identified the gene pf3d7_ <dig> as a pip. its gene product shares 72 % identity with a yeast adp ribosylation factor  which has been shown to interact with yeast pp <dig>  <cit>  . analysis of the pf isolated fragment did not show the presence of known binding motifs to pp <dig>  however the analysis of the full length sequence revealed the presence of  <dig> rvxf motif, suggesting the presence of at least  <dig> pfpp <dig> potential binding motifs in this protein. further, pf3d7_ <dig> and pf3d7_ <dig> showed  <dig> and 39 % of identity with yeast rpp1b and rpl27a respectively , identified by different approaches as interactors of yeast pp <dig>  <cit> .table  <dig> pips identified by yeast two-hybrid screening

when the identified sequences were analyzed for the presence of known binding motifs to pp <dig>   <dig> proteins share the rvxf binding motif and  <dig> contain the fxxx motif, supporting the idea of their role as potential regulators of pp <dig>  indeed, it was reported that 70 % of pp <dig> interacting proteins containing the rvxf motif are regulators of pp <dig> activity  <cit> .

further examination of y2h screening revealed that some identified clones correspond to different portions of the same protein . for instance, pf3d7_ <dig> interacts with pfpp <dig> through the protein portions 4987– <dig>  6176– <dig>  and 9165– <dig> while pf3d7_ <dig> binds pfpp <dig> via the portions 1857– <dig> and 4414– <dig> . for these proteins it seems that their binding to pfpp <dig> could take place through at least  <dig> to  <dig> regions, potentially involving novel binding motifs.

among the isolated clones,  <dig> cdnas representing  <dig> known kinases were identified as potential interacting proteins for pp <dig> but none of the fragments contains any known binding motifs. this supports the idea that these kinases encompass new pp1-binding region/motifs. examination of the full length proteins of these  <dig> kinases showed the presence of at least one binding motif . it would be important to check whether these motifs are also involved in interaction with pp <dig>  taken together, it could be speculated that these kinases could be direct substrates and/or regulators of pfpp <dig> and vice versa.

in addition to the interaction of pfpp <dig> and kinases, pfh2a, pfh2b and pf histone deacetylase  <dig>  have been identified as pips. all of these proteins are associated with nucleosome modifications and could direct the control of gene expression. previous studies showed that the phosphorylation marks of h2a and h2b are detected along with lysine acetylation  <cit> . the interaction of h2a and pp <dig> has also been reported in yeast  <cit>  . taken together, these observations suggest a potential role and/or a control of the pp <dig> network in the marks of histones to govern diverse nuclear actions in p. falciparum.

identification of pips by in silico screening of the pf genome
pp <dig> partners have been identified by biochemical and y2h approaches, both of which can have their limitations: the quality and quantity of protein preparations, or the incapacity of yeast to produce pf proteins . in order to further examine the presence of pips genes in pf, we used an extended rvxf consensus sequence mentioned in materials and methods. the choice of this extended consensus sequence, referred thereafter as rvxfext, was based on previous studies indicating its high specificity  <cit> . the first consensus sequence defined by wakula et al.  <cit>  was not used in this study because it is less restrictive and it occurs randomly in ~25 % of all proteins  <cit> . the bioinformatics analysis was performed with orfs present in plasmodb . this screening showed the presence of  <dig> rvxfext motif containing proteins in p. falciparum of which  <dig> proteins contain at least  <dig> motifs . two rvxfext containing proteins were excluded as one corresponds to a pseudogene and the second is annotated twice in plasmodb. interestingly, among the  <dig> in silico pips,  <dig> exhibit at least one additional binding motif to pp <dig>  . in addition,  <dig> proteins identified in silico were also isolated by y2h screening while  <dig> protein was common between the affinity/ms-ms approach and y2h screening . among the  <dig> shared proteins,  <dig> clones identified by y2h screening followed the rvxfext consensus sequence. further, homologs to  <dig> potential in silico pfpips  have been shown to interact with pp <dig> in s. cerevisiae   <cit> . the in silico screening applied in this work cannot include pflrr <dig> and pf inhibitors  <dig> and  <dig>  known to bind and to regulate pfpp <dig> activity. indeed, pflrr <dig> binds pp <dig> through lrr motifs, however pfi <dig> and pfi <dig> encompass the short rvxf motif.table  <dig> pips identified by genome in silico analysis

validation of interaction of pips identified
all interactors identified by the above approaches could be capable of binding directly to pfpp <dig>  to explore this further, we decided to investigate the physical interaction of pfpp <dig> with some of pfpips produced as recombinant proteins. to this end, a binding assay with purified his-tagged fusion pips in e. coli and biotin labeled pfpp <dig> was used. this approach has already been used and validated using recombinant proteins of known partners of pfpp <dig> or derived peptides from binding motifs  <cit> . pfi <dig> and pfi <dig>  previously described to interact with pfpp <dig>  were used as positive controls. a total of  <dig> pfpips were successfully produced as recombinant proteins in e. coli and purified out of  <dig> candidates tested and corresponding to  <dig> different pips.

in the case of the pips identified by pfpp <dig> affinity column,  <dig> proteins were produced out of  <dig>  binding data presented in fig. 2a showed that biotin-pfpp <dig> binds to the  <dig> proteins tested. these data likely suggests that the identified pips are direct interactors of pfpp <dig> fig.  <dig> direct interaction of pips to pfpp <dig>  the binding capacity of recombinant pips  to biotin-pfpp <dig>  was measured using an elisa-based assay. a represents the binding of recombinant pips identified by pp1-affinity column . pfi <dig>  and pfi <dig>  were used as positive controls  and bsa was used as negative control . b represents the binding of pips identified by y2h screening . aan <dig> and aan <dig> are human h2a and h2b proteins respectively which present high identity with pfh2a  and pfh2b . c represents the pips identified by genome in silico analysis . d contribution of the rvxf motifs to the binding of pf3d7_ <dig> and pf3d7_ <dig> to pfpp <dig> . the interaction of pfpp <dig> to wild proteins was considered at 100 % binding. results are presented as mean ± sd of  <dig> independent experiments preformed in duplicate. *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig>  and ***p <  <dig>  , compared to the negative control



next, we searched to check the direct interactions of pips identified by y2h screening and pfpp <dig>  fifteen recombinant pfpips were produced out of  <dig> cloned cdnas tested . the failure for the production of some proteins could be due to the lack of expression and/or to the toxicity for bacteria. for the binding with h2a and h2b, commercially available human recombinant proteins were used as they showed  <dig> and 63 % identity with pfh2a and pfh2b respectively . as depicted in fig. 2b, biotin-pfpp <dig> was able to bind to  <dig> recombinant proteins out of  <dig> tested. these data confirmed a direct interaction between pfpp <dig> and these pips. moreover, this binding assay showed that pips with or without the rvxf motif can bind pfpp <dig> and confirmed that proteins which are out of frame of gal4ad could be true pips. however, under the same conditions,  <dig> proteins did not show significant binding when compared to bsa. the lack of binding is unlikely to be due to an absence of coating of purified protein to wells as the quality of coating was checked using an anti-his antibody . it could be argued that these proteins are not direct partners of pfpp <dig> or their interaction may require additional partner expressed by the yeast.

finally, in order to examine the binding capacity of several in silico pips identified by genome analysis,  <dig> fragments which correspond to  <dig> potential candidates were tested for protein production. the fragments were about  <dig> residues long with the rvxfext motif in the middle of the recombinant proteins . the expression and purification were successful for only  <dig> proteins. their ability to bind pp <dig> was then examined as described above. significant interactions for  <dig> out of  <dig> proteins tested were observed . the lack of interaction of pfpp <dig> with pf3d7_ <dig> could be attributed to the fact that its rvxf is not a valid binding motif. however, it is important to point out that  <dig> pips identified by y2h and in silico screens  were confirmed to interact with pfpp <dig> by elisa , highlighting the accuracy of the rvxf consensus sequence used throughout this study.

to further explore the implication of the rvxf motifs in pfpp <dig> binding,  <dig> pips identified by y2h screening and in silico analysis were mutated in their rvxf motifs and the corresponding recombinant proteins were produced. results presented in fig. 2d showed a significant decrease of the binding with pfpp <dig> . this confirms that the rvxf motifs of these  <dig> pips are the main contributors for binding to pfpp <dig>  however, it could not be excluded that these interactions could involve secondary structures of the protein to stabilize and to lead to a functional complex. this could be attributed to the fact that the rvxf binding motif, in most regulators, is often present in intrinsically disordered regions and the protein could adopt a structure upon binding  <cit> .

the newly rvxf-containing pfpips were then used to reexamine the features of the rvxf motif and the nature of the flanking amino acids in p. falciparum. the accepted motif exhibits the sequence v . interestingly, the amino acids between v and f/w are enriched by s and h . at the n-terminal positions of the rvxf , the most conserved amino acid is the k residue. we have also found a high frequency of l residue at − <dig>  based on these data, the rvxf consensus sequence for pfpips could be extended and refined as v.

pfpp <dig> interaction networks
the identification in this study of  <dig> new pips provides new insights on the functional diversity of pfpp <dig> functions. among the  <dig> identified proteins,  <dig>  have unknown function. for the  <dig> remaining proteins, the most abundant proteins correspond to metabolism, dna maintenance, translation and phosphorylation processes .fig.  <dig> pie chart of biological functions of pips. a total of  <dig> proteins are classified in  <dig> different biological functions based on confirmed or putative functions indicated in plasmodb and shown in our pie chart



based on an earlier published p. falciparum interactome  <cit>  and on the identified pp <dig> interacting proteins reported in this work, we were able to establish three networks where several pips could be involved. the transcription and dna maintenance network illustrated in figure s4a  contained  <dig> direct pips  detected by the different approaches described above and  <dig> connecting proteins . the folding/proteolysis network involved  <dig> direct pips and  <dig> connecting proteins . the pathogenicity network comprised  <dig> direct pips and  <dig> connecting proteins . in the latter network,  <dig> homologs of direct pips in p. berghei  have been shown to be essential for parasite survival as no viable ko parasites can be obtained  <cit> . it is worthy of note that pf3d7_ <dig>  a connecting protein, contains a region of about  <dig> amino acids with 40 % identity with a yeast protein  which has been shown to interact with yeast pp <dig>  <cit> . its homolog in p. berghei  has been shown to be essential for parasite survival  <cit> . the network analysis raises the possibility that new pips could play a role in pathogenicity, at least in part, through their interaction with and regulation of pfpp <dig>  however, it cannot be excluded that these proteins could be also substrates of pfpp <dig> fig.  <dig> pfpp <dig> pathogenicity network. the graph shows interactions  between pips identified by our different approaches  and pfpp <dig> . the gray circles represent connecting proteins based on the results of lacount et al.  <cit> . when available, gene names given in plasmodb are shown in brackets



CONCLUSIONS
the diversity of proteins identified by three different and complementary approaches suggests that pp1c has a wide interaction network which controls several aspects of parasite physiology. a total of  <dig> proteins were identified by these approaches. one protein was common to both y2h screening and pfpp1-affinity column approach and  <dig> proteins to y2h and in silico screenings. this provides experimental support to determine the contribution of the rvxf motif to pfpp <dig> binding when present in pips, to identify new binding regions/motifs specific of plasmodium and to explore the role of pips as regulators, substrates or both. further experiments need to be done to determine pfpp <dig> substrates, for instance by identifying the phosphoproteomes of pf in vitro in the absence and presence of recombinant active pfpp <dig>  and to evaluate whether the new pips could be able to regulate pfpp <dig> activity. these future studies will help to better elucidate pp <dig> signaling in plasmodium and to increase and improve the choice of parasite targets for drug design.
