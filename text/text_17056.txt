BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae is an important bacterial pathogen worldwide that causes localized disease including pneumonia and otitis media , as well as invasive infections such as septicemia and meningitis. the ability of this organism to persist in the respiratory tract and transition between asymptomatic carriage and infection stimulates intense research interest in s. pneumoniae. pneumococcus is a leading bacterial cause of acute om in children where it is estimated that by age five, over 80% of children have had at least one om episode  <cit> . s. pneumoniae is also frequently detected in chronic otitis media with effusion   <cit> , the most common cause of acquired conductive hearing loss in children. while, invasive disease has decreased with the introduction of the pneumococcal heptavalent conjugate vaccine , localized infection in the middle ear has not been reduced as dramatically and new serotypes, some resistant to multiple antibiotics, have emerged  <cit> .

the detection of pneumococcal-specific dna and rna in culture-negative effusions in multiple studies suggests that active bacterial infections are present more frequently than culture results indicate  <cit> , and both the persistence of bacteria and recalcitrance to antibiotic treatment in ome suggest that chronic om may be associated with bacterial biofilm development on the mucosal surface of the middle ear  <cit> . this hypothesis was recently supported by evidence of adherent s. pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis directly on the middle-ear mucosal epithelium  in children receiving tympanostomy tube  placement for chronic otitis media  <cit> . in this study, clusters of adherent pneumococcus were observed on the mem using 16s rrna fluorescent in situ hybridization  and anti-pneumococcal immunostaining. pathogenic biofilm bacteria were absent on mem biopsies from patients undergoing surgery for cochlear implantation, suggesting that adherent bacteria are not typically present on mem.

biofilm development is initiated when bacterial cells attach to a surface, proliferate and extrude a complex extracellular matrix that binds cells together and to a surface. several chronic infections, such as cystic fibrosis pneumonia, and chronic tonsillitis and sinusitis, exhibit biofilm development in the respiratory tract of the human host  <cit> . bacteria within biofilms exhibit two fundamental characteristics: production of an extracellular polymeric substance  matrix and increased resistance to antimicrobial treatment  <cit> . depending on the type of bacteria in the biofilm, the eps can be made up of polysaccharides, proteins and dna  <cit> . following attachment and biofilm development, bacteria may undergo significant phenotypic shifts including induction of different metabolic pathways, reduced cell division, and development of resistance to antibiotic concentrations capable of killing planktonic bacteria  <cit> . biofilm formation is important in understanding the extent of bacterial phenotypic plasticity in response to varying environmental conditions and several papers have reported pneumococcal biofilm formation in vitro under various growth conditions  <cit> .

the pneumococcal capsule is considered a major virulence factor. capsule expression is thought to interfere with biofilm formation  <cit>  and biofilm development may select for unencapsulated phenotypic variants  <cit> . however, s. pneumoniae is also known to phenotypically vary capsule production upon adherence to epithelial cells  <cit> . the polysaccharide capsule-specific regions of s. pneumoniae are encoded by a cluster of genes located between dexb upstream and alia downstream  <cit>  and the capsule is predicted to be transcribed as a single operon, initiating upstream of the most conserved gene in the operon, cpsa  <cit> .

we chose a static culture system to examine biofilm formation under conditions that simulate those in the middle ear during ome. biofilm development in six encapsulated clinical strains of s. pneumoniae representing six different serotypes was assessed by three independent techniques and statistically analyzed to formulate a parametric index of biofilm development that resulted in ranking the strains into two groups. the index was then used to test hypotheses concerning pneumococcal biofilms such as the composition of the extracellular matrix, susceptibility of pneumococcal biofilms to antimicrobial treatment and capsule expression using cpsa.

RESULTS
s. pneumoniae clinical strains vary in initial attachment, kinetics of biofilm formation and biofilm structural complexity and the biofilm forming index 
pneumococcal biofilm development was examined in situ over time for each strain using the baclight kit and clsm. all isolates developed biofilms over the  <dig> day period. however, there was considerable variability in both the extent and kinetics of biofilm development by the isolates, and in the number of viable and nonviable cells . after  <dig> hours all  <dig> pneumococcal isolates had formed heterogeneous biofilms consisting of individual cells, small chains and small clusters of lancet-shaped cells with strain bs <dig> exhibiting the greatest number of attached cells and a complex biofilm architecture at this time point consisting of small clusters and towers . by day  <dig>  strains exhibited a range of ultrastructural characteristics from individual cells and small microcolonies stippled across the surface  to clusters of bacteria in large towers attached to the substratum  . strains bs <dig>  bs <dig> and bs <dig> developed the most extensive biofilm architecture by day  <dig> of culture, growing in tall towers of viable cells up to  <dig> μm in height over the surface . time lapse clsm imaging through the thickness of biofilm towers in real time showed that the towers were free to oscillate indicating that pneumococcal biofilms were dynamic in the fluid . in contrast, strains bs <dig>  bs <dig> and bs <dig> exhibited smaller cell clusters , fewer towers and less extensive surface coverage and ultrastructure. nevertheless, biofilms formed by these strains exhibited numerous microcolonies of viable cells attached on the surface.

to better assess biofilm development quantitatively, cfus of attached pneumococci were enumerated at  <dig> time points to assess the kinetics of biofilm development. viable adherent pneumococci increased over time in all strains. attached viable pneumococci were present for all clinical isolates at day  <dig> ranging from  <dig>  cfus/cm <dig> for bs <dig> up to  <dig>  for bs <dig> . bs <dig> biofilms contained significantly fewer culturable cells and bs <dig> biofilms contained a significantly greater number of cells than all of the other  <dig> strains at day  <dig>  confirming clsm observation. by day  <dig>  there was a significant difference in the number of adherent cells among the clinical isolates; bs <dig> and bs <dig> showed the most viable attached pneumococci with an average cfu/cm <dig> of  <dig> and  <dig> , respectively. bs <dig> averaged  <dig>  log <dig> cfus/cm <dig>  however the number of cfus/cm <dig> for this strain was not statistically different from bs <dig>  bs <dig> or bs <dig> biofilms, which demonstrated average viable attached pneumococcus on the order of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  log <dig> cfus/cm <dig>  respectively. although the kinetics of surface attachment varied among clinical pneumococcal isolates, viable adherent cells increased over  <dig> days in all strains.

all  <dig> clinical isolates also attached over a  <dig> hour period  demonstrated by crystal violet staining. however, strains bs <dig>  bs <dig> and bs <dig> produced nearly twice as much biofilm as strains bs <dig>  bs <dig> and bs <dig>  bs <dig> formed significantly less biomass than all of the other isolates in this assay . there was no significant difference between bs <dig>  bs <dig> and bs <dig> 

strain differences were also quantified using comstat . biofilm biovolume  and maximum thickness were lower for the clinical strains bs <dig>  bs <dig> and bs <dig>  consistent with the experimental results of the cfu/cm <dig> and cv assays, bs <dig> and bs <dig> exhibited the greatest extent of total biomass and maximum thickness . surface roughness, a measure of biofilm heterogeneity, was low for these isolates, with greater heterogeneity correlating with microcolonies separated by large voids . anova analysis of comstat data demonstrated significant differences among the strains with respect to biofilm formation. comparison of averages from grouped comstat data  demonstrated that bs <dig> and bs <dig> exhibited significantly more biomass than the other strains in this biofilm assay.

when data were combined from all  <dig> biofilm assays using the combined biofilm forming index  metric, the strains divided into two groups . strains bs <dig>  bs <dig> and bs <dig> demonstrated far greater biofilm development , while strains bs <dig>  bs <dig> and bs <dig> demonstrated less biofilm development.

bs <dig> and bs <dig> were further examined to assess a high and a low ranked bfi isolate, using high resolution sem. figure 3a shows more widespread surface coverage by the high ranked bfi isolate, bs <dig> compared with bs <dig> and higher resolution images of the isolates showed bs <dig> cells surrounded by extensive extracellular material, anchoring pneumococcal cells to the surface. in contrast, sem showed numerous punctate microcolonies attached over the surface in the low ranked bfi biofilm isolate, bs <dig>  thus, sem results confirmed that these two isolates differed in the number of attached cells, but also in the extent of extracellular material attached to the surface.

s. pneumoniae biofilms demonstrate a carbohydrate matrix
the multilayered s. pneumoniae biofilm towers of bs <dig>  bs <dig> and bs <dig> observed with clsm and sem suggested that biofilm towers were held together by an extracellular matrix. since fixation for sem dehydrates the biofilm and collapses the matrix, we further tested pneumococcal biofilms for extracellular carbohydrate using a cocktail of  <dig> fluorescently-conjugated lectins and the nucleic acid probe, syto <dig> under hydrated conditions. figure 3b shows biofilms of each pneumococcal isolate grown for  <dig> days. high ranked bfi isolates  exhibited a much greater degree of lectin binding, whereas low ranked bfi isolates bs <dig> and bs <dig> exhibited less lectin binding. bs <dig> showed more biofilm ultrastructure using the combination of lectins and syto  <dig> than the other low ranked bfi strains, exhibiting some clusters stained with nucleic acid stain with large discrete patches bound with lectin, however the clusters were uniformly smaller than those of high ranked bfi strains . biofilms of the unencapsulated strain, r <dig>  also bound lectin. colocalization of lectin and nucleic acid binding differed between strains when biofilms were evaluated with imaris colocalization software, using regression analysis . averages of pearson's coefficient showed greater colocalization of nucleic acid and carbohydrate specific probes with biofilms of bs <dig>  bs <dig> and bs <dig>  than bs <dig>  bs <dig> and bs <dig> , consistent with lectin binding correlating with higher order biofilm ultrastructure. high ranked bfi strains significantly differed from low ranked strains .

s. pneumoniae biofilms exhibit increased resistance to antibiotic treatment
to interrogate another fundamental feature of biofilm growth, pneumococcal isolates were tested for antibiotic resistance. growth of planktonic pneumococci from each strain was inhibited  by a concentration of  <dig> μg ml- <dig> azithromycin. in contrast,  <dig> day biofilms of these strains required concentrations from  <dig> to  <dig> fold higher to demonstrate growth inhibition by azithromycin  . high ranked bfi isolates, bs <dig>  bs <dig> and bs <dig>  exhibited a  <dig>   <dig> and 32-fold increase in the azithromycin concentration necessary to achieve no turbidity, indicating bfi correlated with increased resistance to antibiotic inhibition of bacterial outgrowth from biofilms. in situ assessment of  <dig> day biofilms treated with  <dig> μg ml- <dig> of azithromycin for  <dig> hours further showed that all strains demonstrated viable cells after treatment, but high ranked bfi strains, bs <dig> and bs <dig>  exhibited viable cells in large attached cellular clusters with few red cells . in contrast, azithromycin treatment of the low ranked bfi strains  showed only a few viable attached cells.

s. pneumoniae clinical isolates have extracellular dna in the matrix which is degraded with dnase treatment
to further examine the composition of the pneumococcal biofilm matrix, biofilms were stained with picogreen and the nucleic acid dye, syto  <dig>  figure 4a indicates that dsdna is present extracellularly in the biofilm matrix for strains bs <dig> and bs <dig>  to confirm the presence of extracellular dna, when pneumococcal biofilms were treated with pulmozyme®  a significant loss of cells and biomass was observed . biofilm degradation following pulmozyme® treatments was quantified using comstat and results demonstrate that the biomass and average thickness of biofilms of all strains were significantly reduced by dnase treatment in a dose responsive manner . this was true for all strains regardless of their bfi, with the highest concentration of dnase resulting in reductions of over 90% in the average thickness of all strains except bs <dig> . however, maximum thickness was less affected by dnase treatment in all of the strains, suggesting that the eps matrix in biofilm towers consisted of non-dna components.

cpsa expression is downregulated in pneumococcal biofilms
to investigate whether pneumococci in biofilms were encapsulated we examined cpsa expression under planktonic and biofilm growth conditions in  <dig> of the isolates  to see if capsule production was modulated during biofilm development.  reaction.) all planktonic grown encapsulated clinical isolates expressed more cpsa  than the unencapsulated r <dig> strain . however, expression of cpsa was downregulated in the biofilm relative to planktonic growth conditions in all strains, regardless of serotype or bfi. expression of cpsa was higher overall in strains with a high bfi  compared to low ranked strains  with the relative fold reduction  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> , respectively, indicating that bs <dig> exhibited the most extensive downregulation. in situ examination of biofilm-grown isolates using immunofluorescence with type-specific capsule  indicated that capsule-specific antibody binding was brightest in biofilm towers suggesting that pneumococci attached to the surface have a reduced amount of capsule. taken together these results suggest that capsule expression undergoes complex modulation during biofilm growth.

discussion
the ability of upper respiratory pathogens including s. pneumoniae to persist in the nasopharynx and cause chronic disease upon the appropriate conditions may be associated with the ability to form biofilms on mucosal epithelium  <cit> . the presence of structurally complex bacterial biofilms is important because biofilms have been shown to exhibit increased resistance to host immune effectors and increased tolerance to antibiotic treatment  <cit> , and therefore suggest that biofilms may contribute to the persistence of pathogens.

previous reports have shown that s. pneumoniae can form biofilms in vitro using several different models of biofilm culture  <cit>  including a study where cslm data suggested that some of the strains used in the present study differed according to structural complexity  <cit> . moreover in a pair of companion studies we have demonstrated that these strains have vastly different genomic complements  <cit>  and produce significantly different disease phenotypes in an animal model of infection  <cit> . we therefore wished to further characterize biofilm formation of  <dig> of these pneumococcal strains by investigating the kinetics of biofilm formation, biofilm matrix composition, antibiotic resistance and capsule expression.

all clinical isolates developed biofilms containing viable, adherent cells over time under static conditions in vitro. however, biofilm development was highly variable among the different isolates. a multiparameter ranking, formulated to compare biofilm formation among the clinical strains using  <dig> standard assays commonly used to measure biofilm formation, identified two groups: those with a high biofilm forming index ; bs <dig>  bs <dig> and bs <dig>  which attached quickly and produced more biofilm than the other strains, and those with a low bfi; bs <dig>  bs <dig> and bs <dig> which produced biofilms consisting of adherent cells in small cell clusters with few towers. our study suggests that a multi-assay approach for the quantification of biofilm formation better addresses strain to strain variation in the context of overall biofilm heterogeneity. bacteria are frequently categorized as being positive or negative for biofilm formation typically using only a single assay such as crystal violet staining. however, our study suggests that such a binary distinction may lead to an oversimplified conclusion. clearly, each of the six strains formed biofilms, but to different degrees. in the absence of clinical data correlating the degree of in vitro biofilm formation with infection severity and history, a biofilm etiology, even for a poor in vitro biofilm forming strain, should not necessarily be discounted. not only was the bfi a useful construct to provide a clearer picture of the relative biofilm forming capacity of each strain, but it was also useful in testing putative biofilm characteristics, since a higher bfi correlated with greater binding with carbohydrate-specific lectins and antibiotic resistance in vitro.

since sem suggested that bfi was associated with biofilm structural complexity, biofilms from each pneumococcal strain were assessed for the presence of carbohydrate in the eps matrix using lectin binding. high bfi strains  exhibited the most lectin co-localization with the eps matrix, while strains with a low bfi  demonstrated reduced lectin co-localization, suggesting that polysaccharide is associated with larger multilayered aggregates of attached cells. bs <dig> exhibited some biofilm towers associated with nucleic acid and larger discrete patches of lectin binding  than other low bfi strains. lectin binding did not necessarily correlate with the pneumococcal capsule, since an unencapsulated strain  which formed good biofilms, also bound lectin, suggesting that carbohydrate is associated with noncapsular eps.

we further assessed another hallmark of biofilm development; antibiotic resistance. six day pneumococcal biofilms with a low bfi exhibited a 2-fold increase in resistance to azithromycin compared to planktonic growth. however, strains with a high bfi required significantly higher concentrations to inhibit outgrowth from biofilms. in situ examination of  <dig> day biofilms treated with  <dig> μg ml- <dig> of azithromycin   <cit>  showed large clusters of viable bacteria in high ranked bfi strains. few viable attached cells were observed after azithromycin treatment in low ranked isolates. although our study did not reflect a standardized minimum inhibitory concentration on biofilm bacteria due to the difficulty of assessing cell density within biofilms, these results support the hypothesis that biofilm-forming pneumococcal strains can persist in spite of antibiotic treatment and may contribute to chronic infection.

the presence of extracellular dna  in biofilms is now well documented in several types of bacterial biofilms including non-typeable h. influenzae, another major pathogen associated with chronic om  <cit> . we therefore investigated if edna was present in the pneumococcal biofilm matrix. all strains showed evidence of edna shown by in situ staining of the matrix with the dsdna stain, picogreen, and by a dose-dependent reduction of the pneumococcal biofilm biomass by recombinant human dnase i treatment using pulmozyme® , used clinically to treat cystic fibrosis pneumonia. dnase-treated biofilms were significantly reduced in all pneumococcal strains when treated with the clinical dose of pulmozyme® , exceeding 90% reduction in all but one strain. these results agree with those of moscoso et al. who showed that dnase treatment reduced biofilms of the unencapsulated s. pneumoniae strain r <dig>  and are consistent with the ability of s. pneumoniae to autolyse and release dna  <cit> .

other in vitro studies with pneumococci have shown that capsule expression was associated with decreased biofilm formation  <cit>  and some have reported that biofilm development may select for unencapsulated phenotypic variants  <cit> . however, s. pneumoniae is also known to phenotypically vary capsule production upon adherence to epithelial cells  <cit> . therefore we hypothesized that the capsule operon might be downregulated in pneumococcal biofilms. real time-qpcr results indicate that cpsa is downregulated in the biofilm up to 10-fold depending on the strain, compared to planktonic cultures regardless of the strain's bfi, suggesting that capsule production is variably modulated during sessile growth. in situ immunofluorescence staining with anti-capsule type-specific antibody further demonstrated that s. pneumoniae growing in biofilms was encapsulated and capsule immunostaining was brightest in biofilm towers compared to adherent cells. these results support the role of cpsa in capsule production  <cit> . numerous reports demonstrate capsule phenotypic variation and show that variants with greater amounts of capsule colonize epithelial cells less efficiently  <cit> . phenotypic variation of the capsule has been demonstrated microscopically during the initial stages of infection where adherent or invasive s. pneumoniae exhibited reduced amounts of capsule compared to cells not associated with epithelial cells  <cit> . our results showing downregulation of cpsa in pneumococcal biofilms are consistent with observations that s. pneumoniae modulates capsule production upon adherence.

CONCLUSIONS
biofilm growth differed among six clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. a multi-parametric assessment grouped isolates into two categories: those with a high biofilm forming index, which exhibited complex ultrastructure consisting of large multilayered biofilm towers; and those with a low bfi, which exhibited small compact microcolonies. bfi correlated with increased lectin binding and resistance to azithromycin. bfi did not correlate with the presence of dna in biofilm eps or modulation of capsule expression. dnase treatment resulted in a significant reduction of pneumococcal biofilms in all strains, however lectin binding to biofilm towers suggests the pneumococcal biofilm matrix is made up of both carbohydrate and dna. finally, cpsa was downregulated in all biofilm grown strains suggesting that capsule expression is phenotypically regulated upon biofilm development.
