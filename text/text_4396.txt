BACKGROUND
dicer plays a key role in rna interference pathways through the biogenesis of microrna  and small interfering rna   <cit> . most mirna genes are transcribed as long primary transcripts  where stem-loop structures with mature mirna sequences embedded in the arm of a stem are cleaved by the drosha nuclear microprocessor complex releasing a precursor mirna  hairpin  <cit> . the cleavage site is determined mainly by the distance  from the stem-single stranded rna junction of pri-mirna and most pre-mirnas have  <dig> nt-3' overhangs  <cit> . pre-mirnas, exported into the cytoplasm by exportin- <dig> and ran-gtp  <cit> , are processed by the risc loading complex  into 20~ <dig> nt duplexes where the rnase iii enzyme dicer plays a central role together with the double stranded  rna-binding proteins trbp and pact and the mirna-associated rna-induced silencing complex  core component argonaute- <dig>   <cit> . mirna duplexes processed by rlc are finally loaded to mirisc as a double stranded-structure  <cit>  and separated into the functional guide strand, which is complementary to the target, and the passenger strand, which is subsequently degraded  <cit> . strand selection of the functional guide strand by ago <dig> depends on the thermodynamic stabilities of the base pairs at the 5' ends of the two strands  <cit> . duplexes of sirna or mirna produced by dicer can be loaded in either direction to argonaute  <cit> . indeed, the mature mirna either in the 5' or 3' strands can be harboured from pre-mirna  <cit> . on the other hand, endogenous human ago <dig> can bind directly to pre-mirnas in dicer-knockout cells  <cit> . recently, it was reported that human dicer is not essential for loading dsrnas to ago <dig> but functions in pre-selection of effective sirnas for handoff to ago <dig>  <cit> .

human dicer is a ~ <dig> kda protein consisting of several domains; an n-terminal dexh-box rna helicase-like domain, a duf <dig> domain, a paz domain, two rnase iii domains , and a dsrna binding motif domain   <cit> . the two rnase iii domains of dicer form a single dsrna processing center via intramolecular dimerization which together cleave the opposite strands of the dsrna, generating dinucleotide-long 3' overhangs on both ends  <cit> . the crystal structure of dicer from giardia intestinalis showed that the hydrophobic pocket of the paz domain was responsible for the binding of the 3' dinucleotide overhangs of the substrate and the connector helix between the paz domain and rnase iii domain functioned as a molecular ruler measuring the distance from the 3' end of pre-mirna to the cleavage site  <cit> . however, 3'-dinucleotide dsrna overhangs are not essential for binding with dicer  <cit> . when the 3' overhang is removed, dicer can still cleave dsrna through interaction with the remaining 5' overhang  <cit> . this is consistent with macrae et al. who found that the recombinant dicer protein of giardia intestinalis could cleave the dsrna with 5' overhangs  <cit> . however, they used perfectly matched dsrnas with no gap, which might resemble an endogenous sirna precursor. an additional study by flores-jasso et al. showed that human recombinant dicer protein could nick either strand of a mononucleotide-5' overhanged pre-mirna with some strand preferences  <cit> . despite this, the detailed step mechanism for pre-mirna cleavage, especially for the pre-mirna with 5' overhangs, is not yet elucidated.

an alternative nuclear pathway of pre-mirna biogenesis was described where a short intron with a hairpin can be spliced and debranched into pre-mirna hairpin mimics   <cit> . this processing pathway uses intron splicing machinery instead of the drosha endonuclease; mirna precursors generated from intronic sequences  are believed to be incorporated into the canonical mirna pathway as a substrate of dicer. interestingly, mouse pre-mir- <dig> is a mirtron with an  <dig> nt tail at the 5' end  <cit> , although most mammalian mirtron are hairpin structures with single nucleotide overhangs at both ends  <cit> . mature mouse mir-1982* mirna emerges without  <dig> nt-5' overhangs from deep sequencing data of murine cells  <cit>  while the elimination mechanism of this  <dig> nt-5' tail is still unknown.

in this paper, we investigated the detailed processing pattern of hairpin rnas containing 5' overhangs by human recombinant dicer. we show here that human recombinant dicer is able to process hairpin rna with 5' overhangs and two-step cleavage by dicer forms the mature mirna duplex from the hairpin rnas. additionally, pre-mmu-mir- <dig> rna, which is a natural hairpin rna with 5' overhangs, is also processed by a two-step cleavage mediated by human recombinant dicer protein in vitro.

RESULTS
processing of the pre-mirna by recombinant dicer protein
we prepared purified recombinant dicer <dig>  protein containing a flag-tag at the n-terminus . this rdicer does not contain known dicer-binding partners, ago <dig> and trbp . in order to confirm activity, we attempted to cleave pre-mirna hairpin rna using the rdicer. forty-five pmol of pre-mir- <dig> rna  was incubated with  <dig> pmol of the purified rdicer at the indicated times followed by purification. the reacted rna substrates were subjected to northern blotting using probe- <dig>  corresponding to the antisense sequence of bases 2- <dig> of pre-mir- <dig> . a single band,  <dig> nucleotides in length, appeared after  <dig> min incubation and gradually increased. thus, the purified rdicer possessed reasonable pre-mirna processing activity to produce ~ <dig> nt mature mirna in vitro .

processing of the hairpin rna with 5' overhangs, rna-i, by recombinant dicer protein
using this rdicer, we performed a cleavage assay on a designed pre-mirna mimic of hairpin rna with trinucleotide-5' overhangs  to analyze whether dicer could process a hairpin rna with 5' overhangs. the cleavage products were detected by northern blotting using three different probes, probe- <dig>  probe- <dig> and probe- <dig>  corresponding to antisense sequences of bases 11- <dig>  bases 49- <dig> and bases 33- <dig> of rna-i, respectively . using probe- <dig>  band  <dig>  appeared after  <dig> min incubation and gradually increased through a  <dig> min-incubation. this processing pattern was similar to that of the around 23-nt product generated from native pre-mirna by rdicer . after  <dig> min incubation, band  <dig>  was detected and the abundance of band  <dig> increased in a time-dependent manner . additionally, using probe- <dig>  band  <dig>  was detected from the 30-min incubation sample . using probe- <dig>  band  <dig>  was detected from the 20-min incubation sample . the processing activity on the hairpin rna with 5' overhangs is comparable to that for natural pre-mirna. this means that hairpin rna with 5' overhangs could also be a substrate for rdicer processing.

to analyze band  <dig> at a longer incubation time, the rna-i was incubated with the purified rdicer and the cleavage reactions were performed for  <dig> min and  <dig> hours. surprisingly, band  <dig> was detected at  <dig> min incubation but disappeared after 16-hours incubation. on the other hand, band  <dig> continued to accumulate . these results showed that band  <dig>  which seems to be a product of first processing by rdicer, disappeared following an extended incubation time.

next, to verify the size of the cleavage products of rna-i, we cloned the 23-nt products after 16-hour rdicer incubation and sequenced them . several clones were obtained from 5'-strand, 3' strand and loop region of rna-i corresponding to bands 2- <dig> in figure  <dig>  respectively. the mirna length heterogeneity generated by rdicer is consistent with the finding in the previous report  <cit> . clones from the 5' strand lacking  <dig> or  <dig> nt the initial of the 5' end of rna-i and clones from 3' strand lack the terminal  <dig> or  <dig> nt of the 3' end of rna-i.

to analyze how band  <dig> is further processed, we labelled the 5' end of the rna-i and incubated the samples with rdicer . time course experiments and cloning results indicated that rdicer could process the 5'-labelled rna-i at the 29-nt position from its 5' end  after  <dig> min incubation and subsequently cleave the 29-nt short rna at the 6-nt position from its 5' end to 23-nt rna  after  <dig> min incubation . this suggests dsrnas with a  <dig> nt-5' strand and a  <dig> nt-3' strand are processed by rdicer from rna-i at the first cleavage and released once from the enzyme. after this, rdicer binds the dsrna again and, measuring from the 3' end of the 29-nt strand, generates 23- <dig> nt rna duplexes via a second cleavage reaction .

in this research, we found that hairpin rna with trinucleotide-5' overhangs was cleaved into a 23- <dig> nt rna duplex through two-step processing by rdicer. this could not be detected if we used only end-labelled rna or label-incorporated rna as a substrate for rdicer as reported previously  <cit> . in the first step, rdicer processes the hairpin rna with 5' overhangs to dsrna with  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt. our results indicate the first processed dsrna binds again in the inverse direction with the same or a different rdicer molecule and is again effective cleaved. the results are consistent with the previous report that human dicer protein binds either 3' ends of dsrna strand on the paz domain and cleaves dsrna at the ~ <dig> nt position from the binding end  <cit> . in the sequential process described here, dsrnas with  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt gradually increased and then stabilized at a steady level, followed by rapid increase of 23- <dig> nt duplexes . this indicates that dsrnas with  <dig> nt and  <dig> nt are processed at a constant rate and 23- <dig> nt duplexes are belatedly processed at a similar rate. this suggests that the binding and processing of mirna duplexes and releasing of the duplex from rdicer occur at the same rate. the bidirectional binding of processed dsrna by dicer could result in directional presentation of dsrna to argonaute  <cit> .

the effect of 5' overhangs in substrate cleavage by recombinant dicer protein
we generated three different hairpin rnas based on pre-hsa-mir- <dig> rna: pre-mir- <dig> rna, rna-i and rna-ii . rna-ii is the same as pre-mir- <dig> rna except for 5' addition. using probe- <dig> to detect the cleavage product from the 5' strand for northern blotting, both bands of mature mirna in figure 2b and band  <dig>  in figure 3b emerged after 20-min incubation and increased gradually. on the other hand, band  <dig>  in figure s1b was detected faintly after 30-min incubation but increased quite slowly . band  <dig> in figure s1c was also detected in a similar manner as band  <dig> . our results indicated that longer 5' overhangs with stable stem structures could reduce the efficiency or rate of substrate cleavage.

processing of an endogenous hairpin rna with 5' overhangs, pre-mmu-mir- <dig> rna, by recombinant dicer protein
to demonstrate the processing ability of dicer protein with not only designed pre-mirna with 5' overhangs but natural pre-mirna with 5' overhangs, we performed the processing experiment using pre-mmu-mir- <dig> rna with rdicer. the cleavage products were detected by northern blotting using two different probes, probe- <dig> and probe- <dig>  corresponding to antisense sequences of bases 12- <dig> and bases 52- <dig> of pre-mmu-mir- <dig> rna, respectively . using probe- <dig>  band  <dig>  appeared after  <dig> min incubation and gradually increased. after  <dig> min incubation, band  <dig>  was detected and the abundance of band  <dig> increased in a time-dependent manner . additionally, using probe- <dig>  band  <dig>  was detected from the 10-min incubation sample . pre-mmu-mir- <dig> rna can also be processed by in vitro rdicer activity.

to analyze that band  <dig> could be further processed to band  <dig>  we labelled the 5' end of the pre-mmu-mir- <dig> rna and incubated the samples with rdicer for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours . the signal intensity of 35-nt band decreased in a time-dependent manner, while on the other hand, the 12-nt band increased . these results showed that band  <dig> was a 35-nt product of initial rdicer processing and  <dig> nt from the 5'end were eliminated by a second, rdicer-catalyzed cleavage reaction generating a 23-nt product. our results indicated that mature mir- <dig> and mir-1982* rna could be generated in vitro from pre-mmu-mir- <dig> rna by the two-step dicer processing reaction described above.

in addition to mirna maturation, mammalian dicer also processes other kinds of small rnas including endo-sirnas  <cit> . it has been reported that mammalian endo-sirnas are processed from various precursors including long hairpin rnas and naturally formed dsrnas resulting from bidirectional transcripts or antisense transcripts from pseudogenes. although the complete structure of these precursor dsrnas remains unclear, it seems likely that they have diverse 5' and 3' structures. our results indicate dicer tolerance for 5' substrate overhang, potentially increasing the range of small rna substrates that dicer can process. recently, it was reported that the ago <dig> protein could bind not only sirnas and mirnas but longer rnas and pre-mirnas  <cit> . however, most endogenous ago <dig> proteins bind mirnas  <cit>  and the risc requires 3' overhangs for the dsrna incorporation  <cit> . as this research shows, dicer could process pre-mirnas, longer dsrnas and hairpin rnas with 5' overhangs into dsrna with 3' overhangs, which might be subsequently loaded with canonical length to the risc. further experimentation is required to connect our findings with the ago loading mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS
we show human rdicer recognizes and processes a hairpin rna bearing a trinucleotide-5' overhang, and the two-step cleavage by rdicer forms canonical mirna duplexes from the hairpin rnas. it indicates that human rdicer functions as a molecular ruler by anchoring the 3' end of both the hairpin rna with 5' overhangs and the 5' strand in the intermediate duplex. moreover, an endogenously-expressed pre-mirna with 5' overhangs, pre-mmu-mir- <dig>  also can be utilized as a substrate of rdicer and processed into a canonical mirna duplex by the two-step cleavage reaction. while pre-mmu-mir- <dig> rna is a naturally expressed pre-mirna  <cit> , this 5'-overhanged structure is not a suitable substrate for nuclear export by exportin- <dig>  <cit>  and, assuming the absence of possible alternative export pathways, may not be presented to cytoplasmic dicer in the cells. however, it is worth noting a recent report, that mammalian dicer might be located in the nucleus and associate with ribosomal dna chromatin  <cit> . we have also observed human dicer localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus . these findings raise the intriguing possibility that nuclear dicer could process hairpin rna with 5'-overhangs, like pre-mmu-mir- <dig> rna.

the two-step cleavage of a hairpin rna with 5' overhangs shows that rdicer can release dsrnas after the first cleavage and binds them again in the inverse direction for a second cleavage. the dicer protein's ability to release and bind dsrna again indicates dicer could be capable of binding and processing dsrna multiple times during short rna maturation. dicer has recently been linked to the processing of diverse non-coding rna precursors with as-yet undetermined structures. the experiments performed above suggest dicer has considerable flexibility in processing precursors, contributing to an ability to generate various short rna products for incorporation into functional riscs.
