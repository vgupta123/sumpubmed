BACKGROUND
in angiosperms, stigmas discriminate between compatible and incompatible pollen grains by preventing the adhesion, hydration, penetration, and growth of incompatible pollen  <cit> . after landing on the stigma, compatible pollen grains hydrate and germinate to produce pollen tubes that penetrate the stigma surface. these pollen tubes then utilize signals and nutrients from the stigma or style for successful pollination and fertilization. to carry out these reproductive processes, two types of stigmas have developed in flowers. one type is the wet stigma, which deposits fluid secretions or exudates on its surface. the other is the dry stigma, which has an intact papillate surface on which the stigma interacts directly with pollen grains  <cit> . species with dry stigmas include the model plant species arabidopsis  and the economically important grasses rice  and maize . with the exception of self-incompatibility , relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms of plant reproduction in dry stigmas.

because many genetic, cellular, and biotechnological tools, as well as a maize reference genome , are currently available, maize has been proposed as a model grass to study the function of the dry stigma in reproduction  <cit> . maize silk is a specialized elongated tissue that is functionally equivalent to the stigma and style of a typical pistil  <cit> . hairs that are located on the silk surface serve as receptive structures to support pollen adhesion, hydration, and germination. to possess this unique function, maize silk must express genes and produce proteins required for successful pollination, and many of these genes might be specifically or preferentially expressed in silk. a genome-wide identification of silk-specific/preferential genes might therefore serve as an initial step in the analysis of the molecular pathways involved in reproduction. to obtain silk-specific/preferential genes at the whole genome level, we performed a deep sequencing analysis in maize silk using next-generation sequencing  <cit>  and microarray analysis.

several mechanisms related to pollination and fertilization has been implicated in pollen germination, pollen tube guidance, and pollen-ovule interactions  <cit> . in contrast, little is understood about the molecular mechanisms of stigmatic reproductive functions. a major challenge to the study of reproductive functions of the stigma is the dearth of informative mutants, especially for grasses  <cit> . exploring stigma function through comparative genomics is likely to yield valuable information and build a link between morphological and genetic analyses. candidate genes thus identified can be selected for further reverse genetic analysis. to date, genome-wide transcriptome analysis of dry stigmas has been conducted in arabidopsis, rice, and maize  <cit> . the arabidopsis stigma dataset was established by cdna subtraction and microarray analysis of stigma tissues  <cit> . in rice, the stigma dataset was generated using a 57 k affymetrix rice whole genome array and 10 k cdna microarray  <cit> . microarray and rna-seq analyses have recently been performed on different maize tissues of inbred line b <dig> at vegetative and reproductive stages and on silk at the anthesis stage  <cit> .

in this study, rna-seq was performed to analyze transcript abundance profiles of mature silk , mature pollen , mature ovary , and 6-day-old seedling . to build a profile of candidate silk genes that are involved in early pollination events, genes expressed in maize silk were compared with those expressed in the other three tissues. we identified  <dig>  genes that were specifically or preferentially expressed in maize silk. bioinformatic analysis of the maize silk dataset not only identified pathways and genes that have been shown to be essential for pollination, but also a number of genes with novel or previously-unidentified functions, such as those encoding amino acid transporters, peptide and oligopeptide transporters, and cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases . in addition, we characterized conserved and distinct features of dry stigmas by comparing stigma-specific/preferential datasets of arabidopsis, rice, and maize.

RESULTS
transcriptome analysis of reproductive organs and seedlings in maize
to identify genes involved in reproductive processes, an rna-seq analysis was performed on ms that emerged from the husk over 3 days . to eliminate transcripts involved in vegetative growth and basic metabolism in silk tissue, the transcriptomes of mp , mo , and sl  were also sequenced. this enabled us to distinguish transcripts specific to silk from transcripts that contribute to common plant functions. mrnas from the four tissues were used to construct libraries, which were then sequenced on an illumina hiseq  <dig> system. after sequencing quality control  and removal of the “dirty” raw reads , the number of purity-filtered reads ranged from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> per library .

to identify genes corresponding to reads in each library, the purity-filtered reads were mapped to version  <dig> of the maize b <dig> reference genome   <cit>  with the short oligonucleotide alignment program  <dig>  aligner   <cit> . to make the libraries meaningful, reads that appeared less than four times per million unique mapped reads were eliminated from further statistical analysis. as a result, a total of  <dig>  genes were expressed in ms,  <dig>  in mp,  <dig>  in mo, and  <dig>  in sl . as shown in figure 1e, the extent of gene overlap was determined by comparing the transcript libraries of the four experimental tissues. many genes  expressed in ms were also detected in mo and sl but not in mp, implying that the transcriptome of ms is closer to mo and sl than to mp.

to investigate the difference between the transcriptome profile of ms and those of mp, mo, and sl, a pearson correlation coefficient  analysis was performed on the sequencing libraries derived from the four tissues . overall, pcc values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . as expected, sl tissue was poorly correlated with mp  and ms . interestingly, however, ms showed a higher correlation with mo  than with mp and sl. the results indicate that the expression patterns of genes in ms were similar to those in mo, in which many genes may be involved in female reproduction. to further clarify the functional difference between the four tissue transcriptomes, a comparative gene ontology  analysis   <cit>  was performed on the genes expressed in the four tissues . notably, the ms-expressed genes were most represented in biological processes such as cell wall function, lipid transport, carbohydrate catabolism, and aminoglycan metabolism. interestingly, genes relating to neuropeptides and neurotransmitters were overrepresented in ms, while genes involved with these functions were barely detected in the other three tissues. taken together, the results show that ms-expressed genes were distinct from those expressed in vegetative tissues  and other reproductive organs .

comparison between rna-seq data and microarray and real-time pcr data
the transcript abundance profiles of ms, mp, and mo were analyzed using the affymetrix 18 k maize genome array, and the results were compared with the rna-seq data. spearman rank correlation coefficients  of log2-transformed expression values were calculated between the three corresponding tissue pairs in the two datasets. the scc value between the dissimilar tissue pair ms and mp was calculated as a negative control . as a result, scc values between the same tissues  were greater than those between dissimilar tissue pair . in addition, we used a scatter diagram to plot the log2-transformed expression values from the microarray and rna-seq analyses of the three same tissue pairs and the one dissimilar tissue pair . these plots illustrate that similar expression patterns were detected for the same tissue using the two different techniques. transcript abundance values generated by the rna-seq analysis were distributed much more broadly than those from the microarray analysis. this difference may be due to the wider range of expression detected by rna-seq compared with the microarray. overall, these results indicate that data from rna-seq and microarray analyses were comparable.

real-time pcr analysis was employed to further validate the expression of genes examined by rna-seq in ms, mp, mo, and sl . we randomly selected  <dig> genes, including eight with putative functions belonging to different gene families, nine encoding hypothetical proteins, five encoding expressed proteins, and five without annotation . results showed that the expression patterns of these genes were well correlated with the rna-seq results , supporting the reliability of our rna-seq data.

identification and functional classification of genes specifically or preferentially expressed in maize silk
analysis of genes specifically or preferentially expressed in ms might lead to a better understanding of the involvement of maize silk in plant reproduction. to this end,  <dig> genes specific to the ms library, compared with those from the other three tissues, were identified . a significance of digital gene expression analysis  <cit>  was then conducted to compare ms vs. mp, ms vs. mo, and ms vs. sl. using fold change ≥  <dig>  false discovery rate  < 1e- <dig>  and p-value < 1e- <dig> as criteria for each comparison,  <dig> genes were identified from all three comparisons, and their transcript abundances were significantly greater in ms compared with mp, mo, and sl. these genes were considered to be preferentially expressed in ms. a total of  <dig>  genes specifically or preferentially expressed in the silk were thus identified . these genes were subsequently divided into  <dig> categories and one unassigned gene category using mapman  <cit> . the genes involved in rna binding, processing, and transcription, protein targeting and degradation, signal transduction, miscellaneous enzyme families, and transport were well represented .

in the category of rna binding, processing, and transcription,  <dig> genes encoding transcription factors  were identified. most  belonged to six families: myb, wrky, nac, c2c2-co-like, bhlh, and ap2-erebp . expression and genetic analyses have substantiated the involvement of all six tf families in flower development and reproduction  <cit> . it is unclear, however, whether these tfs are directly involved in pollen-stigma interaction.

genes encoding ubiquitin-proteasome-system  proteins constituted a large proportion  of the protein targeting and degradation category . recent studies have shown that ups proteins function in both sporophytic and gametophytic si  <cit> . an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase, armadillo repeat containing  <dig> , is required for the rejection of incompatible pollen in sporophytic si in brassica pistils  <cit> , and f-box proteins  assist degradation of s-rnase in non-self pollen tubes in gametophytic si  <cit> . although a large number of ups-related genes were identified in maize silk, si has not been reported in maize; gametophytic si has been found, however, in wild relatives of maize  <cit> . moreover, ubiquitin has been shown to be involved in human sperm discrimination during fertilization  <cit> . abnormal sperm is ubiquitinated on its surface, and then phagocytosed by epididymis cells  <cit> . our findings provide new insights into the function of ubiquitin during pollen-stigma interaction in plants. the roles of genes encoding ups-related proteins in maize silk deserve further investigation.

seventy-one genes encoding receptor-like kinases  were identified from the signal transduction category. these genes were classified into  <dig> subfamilies . the largest subfamily includes  <dig> receptor-like kinases  or crks, which play important roles in regulation of pathogen defense and programmed cell death  <cit> . despite the essential roles of cysteine-rich proteins  in si and in pollen tube growth and guidance, the function of crks in pollen-pistil interaction has not been reported. however, based on a recent study involving pdlp <dig> with two duf <dig> domains, we tentatively propose that the enrichment of crks in maize silk suggests an enhanced cell-to-cell trafficking role in this species  <cit> . the second largest category of genes encodes cytoplasmic receptor-like kinases . these kinases are directly activated by calcium/calmodulin that modulates pollen tube growth and pollen-pistil interaction  <cit> . the function of stigmatic rlcks in compatible pollination is still unknown. the third category consists of genes encoding leucine-rich repeat rlks that are involved in regulation of pollen tube growth in petunia and tomato  <cit> . examples in this category include leprk <dig> and leprk <dig>  which are two well-defined pollen kinases that act in pollen-pistil interaction primarily by perceiving signals from pistil to regulate pollen tube growth. additionally, six s-locus receptor kinase  proteins were identified from the ms-specific/preferential dataset. in brassica and arabidopsis, srks are usually localized in stigma papilla cells, and interact with s-locus cysteine rich proteins to control si response  <cit> . we therefore suggest that genes encoding rlks are probably important participants in stigma-mediated reproductive processes, but their functions in compatible pollination require further genetic elucidation.

bioinformatic analysis revealed a number of maize silk genes that may act in reproductive processes
to identify go terms significantly enriched in genes specifically or preferentially expressed in ms, a singular enrichment analysis   <cit>  was performed. genes were classified based on their cellular component, molecular function, or biological process, and  <dig> go terms were overrepresented in ms based on p-value <  <dig>  and fdr ≤  <dig>  cutoffs . most of the overrepresented go terms were involved in transport, cell wall regulation, signaling, and lipid metabolism, which are essential in stigmatic reproductive processes  <cit> . this suggests that the identified ms-specific/preferential dataset reflects the reproductive characteristics of maize silk.

go terms with p-value <  <dig>  and fdr ≤  <dig>  were regarded as overrepresented terms.

based on go cellular components, the two go terms designated as integral to membrane and peroxisome were overrepresented in the ms-specific/preferential datasets . several studies have shown that proteins integral to membranes play important roles in pollination  <cit> . on the other hand, the functions of all five peroxisome-associated proteins are unknown . we therefore identified their homologous genes in arabidopsis by performing a blastp search against the arabidopsis protein database  <cit> . two identified genes encode peroxins, two gene products may be related to peroxisome biogenesis, and one gene product is involved in fatty acid metabolism. among these genes, peroxin is essential for female and male gametophytic recognition, according to an analysis of the loss-function mutant abstinence by mutual consent <cit> .

based on the go molecular function and biological process analyses, terms with lipid-related annotation were overrepresented, including lipid binding, lipid transport, and fatty acid metabolic processes. this is consistent with previous findings that lipids play important roles in pollination  <cit> . we therefore further analyzed lipid metabolism-related genes in the ms-specific/preferential gene dataset using mapman  <cit>  . nearly 30% of the genes were involved in fatty acid synthesis and elongation. these overrepresented genes encode members of 3-ketoacyl-coa synthase , long-chain acyl-coa synthase, acyl-activating enzyme, and acyl-coa binding protein families. kcs proteins are responsible for the synthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids , which are major components of the cuticle  covering the stigma  <cit> . in arabidopsis, mutations in fiddlehead and cer genes have been shown to disrupt vlcfa biosynthesis, and thus affect pollen-stigma interaction, indicating important roles for vlcfas in reproductive processes  <cit> . we also identified a number of genes involved in phospholipid synthesis in the ms-specific/preferential gene dataset. phospholipids regulate pollen germination and tube growth  <cit> , but their functions in the stigma are unknown. moreover, genes involved in lipid transport and degradation were also overrepresented. most of the genes encoding lipid binding proteins and lipid transfer proteins  that have been shown to be essential to successful pollen adhesion and tube guidance were studied in wet stigma species  <cit> . in addition, we found many genes involved in lipid degradation and desaturation, such as genes encoding triacylglycerol lipase, acyl-coa thioesterase, phospholipase d, gdsl lipases, and fatty acid desaturase. according to several recent studies  <cit> , some of these proteins may support pollen hydration and germination. for example, exl <dig>  a member of the gdsl family, is involved in rapid initiation of pollen hydration on the stigma  <cit> . because application of unsaturated triacylglycerols to stigma-less tobacco plants promotes pollen hydration and germination  <cit> , fatty acid desaturase might be required for reproductive success in the stigma.

genes involved in various transport processes, including transport of amino acids, oligopeptides, lipids, and drugs, were overrepresented based on go biological process analysis . the stigma is a specialized tissue that secretes materials supporting the growth of compatible pollen tubes and inhibiting the growth of incompatible pollens  <cit> . to investigate transport-related genes in the ms preferential gene dataset in detail, a mapman functional analysis  <cit>  was performed . unexpectedly, genes encoding amino acid, peptide, and oligopeptide transporters constituted a large proportion of the transport-related genes. results from a recent study showing that amino acids transported from the pistil regulate glutamate receptor-like proteins, which in turn control pollen tube ca2+ concentration and growth, provide an insight into amino acid transporter function in maize silk  <cit> . furthermore, atptr <dig>  a gene encoding a peptide transporter in arabidopsis, was found to facilitate peptide uptake into germinating pollen  <cit> . another peptide transporter gene, atptr <dig>  is also expressed in the stigma and style, and may function in a similar manner to supply peptides for initial pollen tube growth  <cit> . in addition, as shown in figure  <dig>  genes for potassium, unspecific cation, divalent, gated, and calcium channel proteins were also well represented. among these, potassium and calcium channel proteins were overrepresented. in the stigma, ca2+ is required for pollen germination and pollen tube guidance  <cit> . although potassium channel proteins and k+ have been implicated in regulation of pollen tube growth  <cit> , their roles in the pistil are yet to be investigated.

approximately 14% of genes identified in the maize genome encode proteins with putative n-terminal signal peptides, and nearly 19% of the genes specifically or preferentially expressed in ms encode proteins involved in the secretory pathway . the genes enriched in maize silk are likely participants in extracellular signaling. various secreted polypeptides have been reported to be involved in signaling during pollen-pistil interaction. these include pollen tube attractants, factors for pollen germination and tube growth, and determinants of si. interestingly, most of these are crps  <cit> , but so far, no crps have been identified from stigmas in the poaceae. in this study, we used sequence motif models generated from each crp subfamily  <cit>  to identify crps in the ms preferential datasets . identified crp sequences have n-terminal signal peptides, and crp subcellular locations include the cell wall, plasma membrane, and endomembrane system . classes of crps identified in the maize silk preferential dataset include ltps, lipid binding proteins, and serine-type endopeptidase inhibitors. style/stigma cysteine-rich protein, a plant ltp, is involved in adhesion of the pollen tube to the transmitting tract  <cit> . the large number of ltps identified from maize silk may provide an explanation for how pollen tubes can adhere to the epidermal surface of the transmitting tract during their long journey through the maize silk. lipid binding proteins are also involved in pollen-pistil interactions. for example, glycine-rich proteins with lipid binding domains reduce pollen hydration rates  <cit> . although serine-type endopeptidase inhibitors have not been implicated in pollen-pistil interactions, these inhibitors are known to participate in cell-to-cell communication during plant-pathogen interactions  <cit> .

dry stigmas may share similar mechanisms in the early stages of pollen-stigma interaction
dry stigma preferential datasets have currently been generated for two species: arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . to reveal the conservation or divergence of stigma preferential genes among different dry stigmas, we compared gene sequences generated from these earlier studies with our ms-specific/preferential gene sets.

for this purpose, protein sequences of  <dig>  maize silk-specific/preferential genes were extracted and blasted against the msu rice protein database  <cit>  and arabidopsis protein database  <cit> , with homologous proteins filtered using an e-value ≤ 1e- <dig> cutoff. we then selected homologous protein-encoding genes that were also included in rice and arabidopsis stigma-specific/preferential datasets. for each maize gene, only the best hit  of these genes in the rice or arabidopsis stigma-specific/preferential datasets was selected as the homologous gene. we found that  <dig> genes specifically or preferentially expressed in maize silk  were homologous to  <dig> rice stigma-specific/preferential genes  , while  <dig> maize silk-specific/preferential genes  were homologous to  <dig> arabidopsis stigma-specific/preferential genes  . we also blasted the protein sequences of the  <dig> rice and  <dig> arabidopsis stigma-specific/preferential genes against the maize agpv <dig> 5b filtered gene set peptide database  <cit> . homologous maize genes were identified using the same criterion as above. as a result,  <dig> rice stigma-specific/preferential genes  matched  <dig> maize silk-specific/preferential genes  , and  <dig> arabidopsis stigma-specific/preferential genes  matched  <dig> ms-specific/preferential genes  . from these blast results, we found that the three dry stigma-specific/preferential datasets match each other well, suggesting conserved mechanisms across monocots and dicots.

we found that  <dig> maize silk-specific/preferential genes had homologous matches in both rice  and arabidopsis  stigma-specific/preferential datasets . the proteins encoded by some of these genes  have been shown to be involved in the early events of pollen-stigma interaction. for example, s-locus glycoproteins participate in pollen adhesion  <cit> , aquaporins and gdsl lipases regulate the process of pollen hydration  <cit> , fatty acid-elongation-related proteins participate in pollen hydration and pollen tube germination  <cit> , and expansins and pectinesterases function in initial growth and penetration of the pollen tube into the stigma surface  <cit> . despite differences in their morphology and transcript abundance patterns, dry stigmas of maize, rice, and arabidopsis may share similar mechanisms in the early stages of stigma-mediated reproductive processes.

maize stigma shares more conserved functional mechanisms with rice than with arabidopsis
to compare the characteristics of stigma-specific/preferential genes among maize, rice, and arabidopsis, we classified the genes in all three dry stigma datasets into  <dig> categories and one unassigned gene category using mapman  <cit>  analysis, and compared their functional profiles . functional distributions of the genes in maize and rice were very similar to each other, but differed from those of arabidopsis. moreover, genes related to transcription and hormone functions constituted relatively larger proportions in maize and rice than in arabidopsis. these results suggest that transcriptional regulation networks and hormone-mediated regulation play more prominent roles in stigmas of maize and rice than in those of arabidopsis.

the expression profile of maize silk-specific/preferential genes shared more similarity with that of rice than with that of arabidopsis . a large number of genes were conserved between maize  and rice  stigma-specific/preferential datasets, but the same genes were not present in the arabidopsis dataset. to further analyze common characteristics shared between maize and rice, we performed go analysis on these conserved genes  <cit> . gene terms related to protein serine/threonine kinase activity, protein amino acid phosphorylation, and oligopeptide transport were overrepresented . because maize and rice are both members of poaceae while arabidopsis belongs to brassicaceae, we suggest that mechanisms related to stigma function are more similar in species with closer genetic backgrounds.

amino acid and lipid transport-related genes are involved in distinctive mechanisms of maize silk-mediated reproductive processes
comparison of functional profiles of the three different dry stigmas  revealed that genes involved in transport and in protein targeting and degradation represented a larger percentage of the ms-specific/preferential dataset than those of rice and arabidopsis. in addition, we identified  <dig> genes that were distinctively represented in ms-specific/preferential dataset . go analysis of these genes indicated that genes involved in amino acid transmembrane transporter activity and in amino acid and lipid transport were overrepresented . a previous study has shown that nutrients in pollen can support only about  <dig> cm tube growth in maize silk  <cit> . for successful fertilization, maize silk must provide enough nutrients and appropriate signals to support pollen tube growth and guidance for a much longer distance. these supporting activities are apparently carried out by the distinctively-enriched transporters in maize silk. in accordance with this idea, we identified  <dig> amino acid transporter genes in the maize silk-specific/preferential dataset, but only one gene in rice and none in arabidopsis. as shown in previous studies  <cit> , amino acid-mediated communication is required for pollen-pistil interaction. the transporters may also transfer amino acids into the pollen tube to regulate its growth. in addition, the lipid transport-related genes uniquely represented in the maize silk-specific/preferential dataset included a number of genes encoding ltps that may function in the adhesion of pollen tubes to the surface of transmitting tract during their growth in the silk. we therefore suggest that the distinctive expression of genes encoding amino acid and lipid transporters is consistent with the extended length of maize silk.

a number of genes showed presence/absence variations and different expression patterns between different maize inbred lines
two recent transcriptomic studies on maize inbred line b <dig> have revealed important information about temporal and spatial gene expression patterns in different tissues, and highlighted the utility of microarray and rna-seq methods in the generation of databases for gene discovery and functional characterization  <cit> .

in one of the studies, rna-seq analysis generated transcriptome profiles of different reproductive tissues, including cobs and pollen, as well as developing seeds and leaves  <cit> . to make a meaningful comparison between inbred lines b <dig> and zheng <dig>  genes exclusively or preferentially expressed in silk compared with those in post-emergence cob, pollen, and leaf were extracted from the previously-reported data  <cit> , and were searched against our ms-specific/preferential dataset. a total of  <dig> specific and two preferential genes in our dataset were found to be specific to previous data, and  <dig> specific and  <dig> preferential genes were preferentially expressed in the tissues of the previous studies  <cit>  . on the other hand,  <dig> out of  <dig> silk-exclusive genes of inbred line b <dig> were absent from our rna-seq dataset, and  <dig> of our  <dig>  ms-specific/preferential genes were absent from the data derived from inbred line b <dig>  presence/absence variations  between inbred lines b <dig> and zheng <dig> have been found for a number of genes  <cit> . our results indicate that besides the previously-reported pavs, many genes show different expression patterns between these two inbred lines.

we also compared our ms-specific/preferential dataset to datasets derived from tissues absent in our study but present in the two previous studies. a comparison between our ms-specific/preferential dataset and those of leaves, cobs, ovule, tassels, anthers, pollen, seeds, embryo, and endosperm from the previously-reported rna-seq data revealed  <dig> genes specifically and  <dig> genes preferentially expressed in silk   <cit> . a comparison of our ms-specific/preferential dataset with those of roots, whole seedling, internodes, cobs, tassels, anthers, leaves, endosperms, embryos, and pericarp from the previously-reported microarray data identified nine specific and  <dig> preferential genes   <cit> . in addition,  <dig> silk-specific/preferential genes in our dataset were absent from the previously-reported microarray data, which may be due to pavs between different inbred lines or different gene expression detection ranges in rna-seq and microarray techniques. overall, the comparison between our ms-specific/preferential dataset and previous studies on inbred line b <dig> indicate there are many genes with pavs and differential expression patterns. in addition, consistent with previous findings, these results also suggest that some genes involved in reproductive processes are also expressed in vegetative organs where they carry out similar molecular functions  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study,  <dig>  genes expressed predominantly or specifically were identified in maize silk using rna-seq. a number of novel gene sets might be involved in stigma-mediated reproductive processes. a comparative analysis of the stigma-specific/preferential gene datasets of arabidopsis, rice, and maize suggest that 1) different dry stigmas share similar mechanisms in the early stages of pollen-stigma interaction; 2) maize shares more conserved functional mechanisms with rice than with arabidopsis; and 3) genes involved in amino acid and lipid transport might be responsible for the distinct functions of reproductive processes in maize silk. further functional analysis of the identified genes will aid our understanding of stigmatic mechanisms taking place during reproduction.
