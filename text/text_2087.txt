BACKGROUND
in  <dig> a novel h1n <dig> influenza virus emerged and rapidly spread worldwide
 <cit> . clinical disease among affected individuals ranged from mild infection to more severe pneumonia associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome
 <cit> . a recent study estimates that over  <dig>  deaths occurred globally within the first year of the pandemic
 <cit> . highly pathogenic influenza virus infection is characterized by a powerful and potentially destructive immune response
 <cit> . enhanced cytokine production has been observed in cynomolgus macaques infected with  <dig> pandemic h1n <dig> influenza  virus compared to former seasonal h1n <dig> influenza virus
 <cit> , though ph1n <dig> virus does not precipitate a ‘cytokine storm’ seen with highly pathogenic influenza viruses .

the ph1n <dig> virus has been intensively studied in mice, macaques and swine, among other animal models of influenza infection. in the absence of prior host adaptation, inoculation of mice with ph1n <dig> virus generally results in nonlethal infection that is resolved around day  <dig> post-infection. there is low morbidity  and moderate bronchiolitis observed in the lung, despite efficient viral replication throughout infection
 <cit> . alteration of viral pb1-f <dig> and ns <dig> proteins marginally impacted viral pathogenesis
 <cit>  and did not affect viral control of innate immune responses during ph1n <dig> infection in mice
 <cit> . cynomolgus macaques infected with ph1n <dig> virus have shown diffuse alveolar damage, more severe pulmonary lesions, and efficient replication of the virus in the lungs compared to seasonal h1n <dig> influenza virus
 <cit> . swine infected with ph1n <dig> virus develop mild respiratory disease characterized by coughing, sneezing, and acute bronchiolitis, with active replication in the lung
 <cit> . recent studies have shown that the eurasian-origin na and m genes of ph1n <dig> virus are important for transmission among swine
 <cit>  and can also confer transmission in ferrets
 <cit>  and guinea pigs
 <cit> .

differential gene expression induced by ph1n <dig> virus compared to concurrent human or swine influenza viruses has been investigated in mice, macaques and swine by microarray. in mice, the transcriptional program suggests that regulation of lipid metabolism genes plays a protective role, differentiating non-lethal wild-type and lethal mouse-adapted ph1n <dig> virus infection
 <cit> . macaques infected with clinical ph1n <dig> isolates from mexico showed increased expression of nfκb signaling molecule genes, cytokine and chemokine genes, as well as antigen presentation pathway genes compared to seasonal h1n <dig> influenza virus
 <cit> . in a separate study, macaques infected with ph1n <dig> virus also showed enhanced expression of antiviral and interferon -regulated genes, such as ifit <dig> and isg <dig>  compared to seasonal influenza virus
 <cit> . transcriptomic analysis of swine host responses to ph1n <dig> virus revealed pronounced inflammatory response gene expression accompanied by increased expression of pparg-associated lipid metabolism genes compared to the 1918-like classical swine influenza a/swine/iowa/15/ <dig>  virus
 <cit> . in contrast to in vivo models, transcriptomic profiling of infected type i alveolar epithelial cells showed comparable ifn-mediated antiviral and cytokine responses to ph1n <dig> and seasonal h1n <dig> influenza viruses
 <cit> .

performing a comparative transcriptomic analysis across multiple model systems has revealed conserved responses during influenza infection, as demonstrated in a recent study by mcdermott et al. that used multivariate modeling approaches to identify similarities in transcriptional responses to h5n <dig> virus in the lungs of mice and macaques, and human lung epithelial cells
 <cit> . to gain further insight into host responses to ph1n <dig> virus during acute infection, we examined lung gene expression from mice, macaques and swine infected with  <dig> pandemic h1n <dig> influenza a/california/04/ <dig>  virus and compared the transcriptional response in each host. our goals were to identify shared or differential gene expression patterns across species and to infer potential regulators mediating these changes during acute infection. even though ca <dig> virus elicited a similar clinical outcome in each of these species, we found significant differences in the expression of inflammatory and lipid metabolism genes, likely impacted by nuclear hormone receptor signaling complexes including lxr/rxr that is known to regulate cholesterol homeostasis during inflammation. a greater understanding of the differences in acute responses from different hosts is important because it will aid in the design of tailored immunotherapies to influenza virus.

RESULTS
we have previously shown  <dig> pandemic h1n <dig> influenza a/california/04/ <dig>  virus efficiently replicates in the lung of mice and swine, inducing expression of pro-inflammatory genes and causing acute bronchiolitis
 <cit> . infection of macaques with ca <dig> virus is marked by productive virus replication in the respiratory tract and moderately severe clinical symptoms peaking on day  <dig> post-infection , with resolution by day  <dig> p.i. . here, we examined mouse, macaque and swine responses to ca <dig> virus by microarray to further investigate transcriptional changes during acute ph1n <dig> infection. mice were inoculated with  <dig> pfu virus and three animals were euthanized on days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> p.i. these three time points were selected for studying acute phase responses in the mouse. cynomolgus macaques were inoculated with a total infectious dose of 7× <dig> tcid <dig> and two animals were euthanized on days  <dig> and  <dig> p.i. day  <dig> macaque lung samples were collected for studying early host immune responses corresponding to early disease progression and day  <dig> lung samples were chosen for maximum pathology. swine were inoculated intratracheally with  <dig> tcid50/animal and five animals were euthanized on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> p.i. swine lung samples were collected on days  <dig> and  <dig> to examine acute phase responses corresponding to maximal virus shedding and day  <dig> lung samples were chosen for recovery phase. due to differences in the timing and kinetics of acute phase responses in each animal model, we examined gene expression changes within each host and then compared across species.

viral mrna expression was measured in each sample to verify ca <dig> infection prior to microarray analysis . in general, viral mrna levels correlated with viral titers measured in the lung for each species. in mice, viral mrna expression averaged between  <dig>  –  <dig>  log10rq on day  <dig> to  <dig> p.i., corresponding to average lung virus titers between  <dig>  –  <dig>  log <dig> pfu/g of tissue on day  <dig> to  <dig> p.i.
 <cit> . in macaques, average viral mrna expression was highest on day  <dig> and decreased by day  <dig> p.i., which was also reflected in the virus lung titers that reached around  <dig> and  <dig> tcid50/g on days  <dig> and  <dig> p.i., respectively . in swine, viral mrna levels paralleled virus shedding , and the decreased viral mrna expression observed on day  <dig> p.i. was concomitant with resolution of infection in these animals
 <cit> . quantitation of viral mrnas in infected samples used for microarray allowed us to correlate host gene expression changes with relative infection levels.

gene expression analysis of mouse, macaque and swine lung infected with ca <dig> virus
gene expression was profiled using species-specific commercial oligonucleotide arrays. each array contained a different set of transcripts, with greater redundancy for macaque and swine compared to mouse. there are a total of  <dig>  probes represented on the mouse whole genome gene expression microarray, a total of  <dig>  probes represented on the rhesus macaque gene expression microarray, and a total of  <dig>  probes represented on the porcine gene expression microarray v <dig>  due to differences in gene annotation across species, differential gene expression analysis was performed for the transcripts associated with  <dig> unique genes common to all three arrays using ensembl gene identifiers associated with each array probe. this strategy accounted for differences in the number of probes with annotated transcripts and reduced the likelihood of falsely identifying differences in gene expression due to gaps in annotation or gene representation. within this set of genes, there was a large representation of genes associated with cell death, cancer, and cellular growth and proliferation functional categories, as well as genes associated with glucocorticoid receptor signaling, il- <dig> signaling and production in macrophages, and acute phase response signaling canonical pathways.

we investigated the functional classes of underrepresented gene sets present on each specie-specific array, as the focus on unique genes common to all three arrays may introduce bias in our analyses. there was enrichment of molecular mechanisms of cancer, axonal guidance signaling and g-protein coupled receptor signaling canonical pathways, and gene expression functional annotations related to transcription, organismal death and abnormal morphology of cells. data integration and interpretation with a cross-species transcriptomic analysis brings its own challenges and although complete physical maps have been developed for mouse, macaque and swine genomes to support genome sequencing and comparative genomics, functional annotation to date is mostly based on human, mouse, and rat literature. as annotation improves, particularly for less characterized species such as swine, we will likely be able to more fully understand host responses to influenza virus using microarray and next-generation sequencing technologies.

of the  <dig> unique genes common to all three species arrays, we identified a total of  <dig> differentially expressed  genes in mice,  <dig> de genes in macaque, and  <dig> de genes in swine that significantly changed in response to ca <dig> virus on at least one day . the venn diagram shown in figure
 <dig> illustrates the overlap of ca <dig> virus-induced de genes among mouse, macaque and swine infection models, and only  <dig> genes were differentially expressed in all three species. functional analysis of each specie de gene set revealed significant enrichment of genes associated with acute phase response signaling, lxr/rxr activation, and atherosclerosis signaling canonical pathways in infected mice, vdr/rxr activation, hematopoiesis from pluripotent stem cells, and communication between innate and adaptive immune cells canonical pathways in infected macaques, and lxr/rxr activation, nitrogen metabolism, and antigen presentation pathway canonical pathways in infected swine . the genes associated with each canonical pathway shown in table
 <dig> are reported in additional file
 <dig> 

ingenuity pathway analysis was used to determine the top  <dig> canonical pathways. benjamini-hochberg  multiple testing correction p-value was used to rank the significance associated for each pathway.

inflammatory response was significantly enriched in all three ca <dig> infection models, with predicted increased activation in macaques and swine  . a similar number of de inflammatory response genes characterized ca <dig> infection in mice, macaques and swine , though the kinetics of the host response was distinct in each species . in general, mice showed an increase in gene expression as infection progressed, whereas the majority of these genes were consistently upregulated or downregulated on days  <dig> and  <dig> p.i. in ca <dig> virus-infected macaques. in contrast to mice and macaques, swine exhibited enhanced gene expression on days  <dig> and  <dig> p.i. and the host response tapered as the infection resolved. the dissimilarity in the kinetics of gene expression across species may be in part due to differences in virus replication and timing of acute phase responses. therefore, a more complete kinetic time course, including a range of inoculation doses, would be necessary to fully appreciate the impact of differences in acute phase responses to ph1n <dig> virus infection.

differential inflammatory response gene expression distinguishes ca <dig> virus infection in mice, macaques and swine
among the inflammatory response genes there was representation of acute phase response signaling, lxr/rxr activation, and dendritic cell maturation canonical pathways in infected mice, role of nfat in regulation of the immune response, role of macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in rheumatoid arthritis, and g-protein coupled receptor signaling canonical pathways in infected macaques, and enrichment of inflammatory response genes associated with glucocorticoid receptor signaling, dendritic cell maturation, and lxr/rxr activation canonical pathways in infected swine. when we examined the  <dig> genes common to mice, macaques and swine, we noted the majority of genes were upregulated in response to infection in mice on days  <dig> and  <dig> p.i., in macaques on days  <dig> and  <dig> p.i., and in swine on days  <dig> and  <dig> p.i. . inflammatory response genes  included interferon  signaling molecule, stat <dig>  ifn-regulated antigen presentation and immunoproteasome components, tap <dig>  psmb <dig> and psmb <dig>  toll-like receptor  <dig> coreceptor, cd <dig>  and antiviral effectors, ifih <dig> and ifit <dig>  previously shown to play essential roles in innate immune response to influenza infection. we also found several leukocyte-specific genes commonly differentially expressed during ca <dig> infection. members of the immunoglobulin receptor superfamily upregulated across species included cd <dig>  cd <dig> , and cd <dig>  a tlr homologue expressed on b cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. macrophage-restricted receptor, siglec <dig>  neutrophil factors, plunc and ncf <dig>  and t lymphocyte coreceptor, cd8a, were also differentially expressed during ca <dig> infection in each species .

several models show an association between enhanced immune cell infiltrate and severe lung immunopathology. excessive macrophage and neutrophils are observed in the lung of mice following h5n <dig> and  <dig> infection
 <cit> , and in pregnant animals infected with ph1n <dig> virus
 <cit> . in mice, macaques, and swine infected with ca <dig> virus, leukocyte and lymphocyte responses were evident in all three species based on immune cell-specific gene expression changes detected in the lung, though the gene expression patterns varied across species. for example, there was greater upregulation of macrophage factor, siglec <dig>  observed in mice  and macaques  compared to swine on day  <dig> p.i. enhanced expression of leukocyte associated immunoglobulin-like receptor  <dig>  lair <dig>  was observed in macaques and swine infected with ca <dig> virus, as compared to infected mice. in contrast to mice and macaques, swine exhibited strong expression of neutrophil factor, plunc, which we noted was downregulated during infection in the other species . these results reflect a rapid inflammatory shift in the lungs of mice, macaques, and swine during ca <dig> infection that involves different immune cell responses, but unlike h5n <dig> and  <dig> viruses, these immune cell responses do not cause immunopathology. a cross-species transcriptomic comparison of the host response to h5n <dig> and  <dig> viruses would be necessary to further explore the potential role of specific immune cell responses to influenza pathogenesis.

ca <dig> infection impacts glucocorticoid receptor signaling differently across species
we further sought to evaluate ca <dig> virus-induced host responses that were unique to each species by investigating non-overlapping gene sets shown in figure
 <dig>  the most significant canonical pathways represented in each of these three gene sets are summarized in additional file
5: figure s <dig>  the  <dig> de gene set unique to swine was enriched for genes associated with role of jak <dig> and jak <dig> in γc cytokine signaling canonical pathway that included jak <dig> and stat5a genes. differential regulation of jak3/stat <dig> signaling in ca <dig> virus-infected swine may impact the homeostasis and activation of peripheral t lymphocytes. for example, stat5a/b defects results in enhanced apoptosis of t lymphocytes in mice
 <cit> . differential expression of jak <dig> and stat5a genes in swine during ca <dig> infection may also suggest a balance between inflammatory host defenses and glucocorticoid receptor -mediated cellular growth and survival. closer inspection of each species inflammatory response de gene set showed noteworthy representation of gr signaling related genes, such as a2m, fgg, hspa <dig>  il <dig>  and mapk <dig> genes in mice, fkbp <dig>  jak <dig>  ncoa <dig> , and nras genes in macaques, and hspa <dig>  in addition to jak <dig>  and stat5a genes in swine. alpha-2-macroglobulin  identified by mass spectrometry in human saliva was found to exhibit antiviral activity against ph1n <dig> virus
 <cit> .

since gr signaling appears to play a role during ca <dig> infection in mice, macaques, and swine, we used a transcription factor  analysis strategy that combined transcriptomic and dna sequence information to investigate gr and other potential regulators controlling host responses during ca <dig> infection . as summarized in table
 <dig>  we found predicted inhibition of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha, hnf1a, in infected mice on all three days, consistent with our previous report
 <cit> , and predicted activation of pro-inflammatory regulators, stat <dig>  nfκb, and irf <dig> in at least two species. examination of downstream gene targets of gr determined using ipa upstream regulator analysis showed differences in expression across species with more pronounced transcriptional changes observed in mice on days  <dig> and  <dig> p.i. and on the early time points in macaques and swine . through a dna sequence-based approach, we assessed the representation of dna-binding motifs in the promoter region of de genes targeted by hnf1a and stat <dig> using dna sequences from each species genome and regulator dna-binding preferences, modeled as affinity position weight matrices  .

ingenuity pathway analysis was used to determine the top  <dig> upstream regulators. the p-value of overlap was used to rank the significance associated for each upstream regulator. the p-value indicates the significance of the overlap between the genes targeted by the upstream regulator in the ipkb database and the experimental dataset. genes with an apteryx signify regulators that were identified as significantly enriched  by pscan. z-scores for predicted upstream regulators  in each species and at each time point are shown. z >  <dig> predicts activation of the upstream regulator. z < - <dig> predicts inhibition of the upstream regulator.

we have identified enriched tfs and targets from our dataset; however, the analyses reported here coordinately investigate the expression and sequence-specific tf dna binding sites of the de genes, and it does not investigate the combinatorial effects of multiple factors binding to the genomic regions or molecular determinants of transcriptional responses such as receptor ligation or histone acetylation that can collectively contribute to distinct transcriptional profiles
 <cit> . in addition, restriction of the search space to - <dig> to + <dig> nucleotides relative to the transcription start site  can preclude the identification of more distal tfs effecting expression, which may explain why gr is not identified as a predicted regulator , although many target genes are differentially expressed in the data set . future investigations of gr-mediated host responses to ca <dig> virus would need to take into account these considerations as well as the physical interactions between gr and stat <dig>  for example, and chromatin modifications known to occur
 <cit>  to provide a more comprehensive view of transcriptional regulation during ca <dig> infection across different species.

ca <dig> virus significantly alters expression of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis in mice and swine, and vitamin d receptor genes in macaques
vitamin d receptor  and liver x receptor  are ligand-activated transcription factors of the nuclear receptor superfamily that heterodimerize with retinoid x receptor  to modulate an array of immune and metabolic programs . perturbation of rxr-mediated signaling pathways have shown unique roles for vdr in macrophage responses to mycobacterium tuberculosis <cit> , and lxr in macrophage responses to listeria monocytogenes <cit> . in mice and swine infected with ca <dig> virus, we found lxr/rxr activation was among the most significant canonical pathways differentially regulated during acute infection, while vdr/rxr activation was the most significant canonical pathway differentially regulated in ca <dig> virus-infected macaques . as shown in figure
 <dig>  gene expression profiles of lxr/rxr and vdr/rxr associated pathway molecules, as well as genes enriched for communication between innate and adaptive immune cells and acute phase response signaling canonical pathways strongly emphasize the distinct nature of the host response to ca <dig> virus in these three animal models.

macrophages have been shown to increase in mouse lungs following influenza infection and these cells are specific targets of viral infection
 <cit> . in response to ca <dig> virus, we observed a number of genes related to macrophages and with roles in lipid metabolism, such as cholesterol efflux, when examining lxr/rxr activation in mice and swine. in mice, there was marked decreased expression of apolipoprotein genes, including apoe and apoa <dig>  and moderate downregulated expression of macrophage-specific genes involved in recognition of oxidized lipids, such as macrophage scavenger receptor genes msr <dig>  and cd <dig> . the abca <dig> gene, known for its role in cholesterol transport, and the lpl gene, involved in lipid catabolism, were also downregulated in mice. in contrast to mice, swine showed strong upregulation of these genes associated with cholesterol efflux on day  <dig> p.i. previous studies have shown a decrease in abca <dig> mrna expression in lxr-activated primary macrophages via an irf3-dependent mechanism following influenza infection
 <cit> . here, we observe that abca <dig> and other genes associated with cholesterol efflux are significantly downregulated in response to ca <dig> infection in mice, but upregulated in ca <dig> virus-infected swine lung, suggesting that mice may be more efficient at suppressing cholesterol efflux, and in turn, possibly preventing the formation of lipid-laden macrophages . foam cells are the product of inflammatory responses ranging from atherosclerosis  to infection by chlamydia pneumonia <cit>  and toxoplasma gondii <cit> . while the link between influenza-induced innate immunity and cholesterol metabolism is poorly defined, our findings suggest a role for lxr/rxr signaling during ca <dig> infection and indicate that this cellular pathway is impacted differently in two distinct hosts.

in human macrophages and respiratory epithelial cells, vitamin d plays a role in innate immune responses by increasing tlr coreceptor, cd <dig>  and stimulating expression of antimicrobial peptides, such as cathelicidin during respiratory infection
 <cit> . vitamin d has also been investigated in epidemiological studies of reduced risk of influenza infection in different human patient cohorts
 <cit> . in contrast to mice and swine, il <dig> gene expression was more strongly induced in infected macaques on both days. this may indicate macaques mount enhanced th <dig> cell responses during ca <dig> virus infection compared to mice and swine . as shown in figure
 <dig>  we also found increased, expression of vdr/rxr activation associated genes such as cyp24a <dig>  encoding a hydroxylase involved in vitamin d catabolism, rxrg, and hr, a transcriptional corepressor of vitamin d receptor. intriguingly, antimicrobial peptide, camp , was found to be downregulated in mouse and macaques infected with ca <dig> virus, and the decreased expression of camp in ca <dig> virus-infected macaques may be explained in part by the increased expression of apoa <dig> , which has been shown to bind and inhibit camp
 <cit> . while there are several genes associated with vdr/rxr activation that are differentially expressed in macaques infected with ca <dig> virus, vitamin d control of innate immune responses does not appear to play a major role during infection.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown differences in transcriptional responses to a single  <dig> pandemic h1n <dig> influenza virus in three independent animal models. our goal in performing a cross-species transcriptomic comparison was to identify shared and differential gene expression patterns to better evaluate the acute phase in different hosts. we found significant differences in expression of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism genes, which were likely impacted by glucocorticoid receptor and retinoid x receptor signaling complexes, such as lxr/rxr that is known to regulate cholesterol homeostasis during inflammation. the timing and magnitude of the host response is critical in determining disease outcome
 <cit>  and the success of immunomodulatory therapy . for example, corticosteroid therapy in patients infected with ph1n <dig> virus was found to increase the risk of developing severe disease
 <cit> . metagenomic studies using clinical samples will be necessary to further understand the host response to ph1n <dig> virus and other etiological agents within the human population, as recently explored by greninger et al. using a pan-viral microarray and deep sequencing to characterize ph1n <dig> virus from human nasopharyngeal aspirates
 <cit> . despite similar clinical outcomes, differences in the host transcriptional response could suggest that therapeutic targets identified in one host may not be relevant in another.

the gene expression differences elicited by ca <dig> virus within these three independent animal models demonstrate the disparate nature of the host response. there are particular advantages and disadvantages in modeling disease and immune responses to influenza infection in mice, macaques and swine. mice, though largely resistant to infection with most human virus isolates, provide a tractable system for genetic manipulation to study key genes in the regulation of host responses to influenza virus. non human primates are thought to more closely model the human response to influenza virus given their genetic and physiological similarities, while swine serve as a natural reservoir for influenza a viruses and have been linked to the emergence of some of the most notable influenza pandemics in recent history, including the h1n <dig> pandemic in  <dig>  there has been interest in determining the extent to which influenza viruses are able to cause disease in swine, particularly with regard to  <dig> pandemic influenza virus that does not cause severe disease in swine like it does in mice and macaques
 <cit> . this makes swine a unique model for future systems biology analyses that may help to uncover host responses contributing toward the emergence or maintenance of novel influenza viruses with pandemic potential.
