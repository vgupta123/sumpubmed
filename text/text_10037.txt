BACKGROUND
aquaporins are a large family of transmembrane channel proteins that are present throughout all domains of life and their malfunction has been implicated in several human disorders  <cit> . aquaporin channels allow the passive but selective movement of water and other small neutral solutes such as glycerol, co <dig>  or urea across cell membranes  <cit> .

structurally, aquaporins present a homotetrameric organization in which each monomer forms an individual functional pore. the canonical fold of the aquaporin monomer is characterized by a right-handed helical bundle of six transmembrane α-helices  connected by  <dig> loop regions , in which both amino and carboxyl termini face the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. loops b and e are formed by a half-membrane spanning helical section  and a non-helical section that contains the highly conserved asn-pro-ala  motif, considered a signature of this protein family  <cit> .

the aquaporin channel posses two major constriction zones, the npa region, located at the centre of the pore and the selectivity filter  containing the aromatic/arginine region, , located ~ <dig> Å above the npa region extending towards the extracellular side of the channel. the ar/r region is formed by a residue from helix tm <dig> , a residue from helix tm <dig>  and two residues from loop e   <cit> . this region plays a major role in solute selectivity and permeability  <cit> .

different permeability to water and other solutes and variations in the amino acid composition of the ar/r region has led to the classification of aquaporins into two main functional sub-families  <cit> . the first are strict aquaporins, that only allow the passage of water molecules, in which the ar/r region contains a phe residue from tm <dig> , a his residue from tm <dig> , an arg residue from the loop e  and a fourth residue from loop e  that provides a backbone carbonyl oxygen, usually a cys, thr or ala. in these aquaporins, the his and arg residues of the sf are believed to provide donor hydrogen bonds for water molecules  <cit> . examples of strict aquaporins are: aqpz from escherichia coli  <cit> , and the human aqp <dig>  <cit> , aqp <dig> <cit>  and aqp <dig> <cit> . the second are aquaglyceroporins, less selective aquaporins that can transport water and other solutes, such as glycerol, urea and other uncharged small molecules  <cit> . in these aquaporins, the phe residue at position h <dig> is replaced by trp residue, the his residue at position h <dig> is replaced by gly residue and the small residue at position le <dig> is replaced by a phe, giving rise to a wider sf and a so called “hydrophobic corner” formed by trp  and phe  residues  <cit> . similar to strict aquaporins, position le <dig> is occupied by an arg residue that is highly conserved in both aquaporin sub-families. examples of aquaglyceroporins are: glpf  <cit>  from e. coli, and human aquaporins aqp <dig>  aqp <dig>  aqp <dig> and aqp <dig>  <cit> .

the recent identification of archaeal aquaporins that exhibit a different amino acid composition of their sf, and thus cannot be readily classified in either of the two aforementioned aquaporin sub-families, has led to the suggestion that a third functional sub-family of aquaporins may exist  <cit> . it has been suggested that this family could contain special adaptations for the conduction of solutes specific for the life-style of the organisms or, alternatively, that they could be a primitive non-specialized aquaporin, an ancestor of the more specialized aquaporins  <cit> . the sf of these archaeal aquaporins exhibits the highly conserved arg residue in position le <dig>  the phe residue at position h <dig>  and a ser residue in position le <dig> that provides its main chain carbonyl oxygen. however a key difference in the composition of the sf of these aquaporins lies in the presence of a medium size hydrophobic residue such as ile, leu or val instead of the his residue highly conserved in strict aquaporins or the gly residue present in aquaglyceroporins in position h <dig>  <cit> .

to date, the only representative of this type of aquaporins that has been experimentally studied is aqpm, found in the archaeon methanothermobacter marburgensis  <cit> . the osmotic water permeability constant, pf, obtained for aqpm, showed that its osmotic permeability was lower than the pf of the strict aquaporins aqpz from e.coli, and slightly higher than the pf of the aquaglyceroporin from e. coli glpf  <cit> .  =  <dig> μms- <dig>  <cit> ; pf  =  <dig> μms- <dig>  <cit> ; pf  =  <dig> μms- <dig>  <cit> ). moreover, the transient glycerol permeability measured for aqpm resulted in values considerably lower than the glycerol permeability for glpf  <cit> . these previous results have led to the suggestion that aqpm could be a water transporter and also with the ability to transport other neutral solutes required by the archaeon such as co <dig>  the only carbon source available in the natural environment of m. marburgensis, or even h2s, the terminal electron acceptor in its energy production pathway  <cit>  <cit> .

in this work we report the results of the first molecular dynamics  simulation study performed on a fully hydrated model of the aqpm tetramer embedded in a lipid bilayer . key biophysical parameters were estimated from the md simulation, including: single channel osmotic permeability constant , single channel diffusive permeability constant , channel radius, potential water occupancy of the channel and water orientation inside the pore.

the results of this study extend the information regarding the permeability and selectivity mechanisms of aqpm and provide further insight into the water permeability of aquaporins in general and the particular differences between the sub-families of aquaporins and the implications of these differences for their function.

RESULTS
single channel osmotic water permeability constant
the single-channel osmotic water permeability constant  is a key parameter that allows the characterization of the water transport mechanism of aquaporins  <cit> . an estimation of pf can be obtained from equilibrium md simulations and can provide information about the water permeation mechanisms of aquaporins at the atomic level  <cit> . here, we report the calculation and analysis of pf obtained from a  <dig> ns simulation of the aqpm tetramer. the calculation of pf is based on the collective diffusion model for water permeation through microscopic channels developed by zhu et al.  <cit> . initially, a trajectory for the collective coordinate n was derived  and the corresponding mean square displacements  were calculated . figure 2a displays the trajectory of the collective coordinates n for each monomer of aqpm in the  <dig> ns simulation and figure 2b shows  computed by averaging  <dig> 100-ps time windows, each one considered as a time origin  = 0). the length of the channel is a necessary parameter for computing n and was defined as the average length of the constriction region  of the aqpm channel, , considered as the average distance between the atoms g195:o† and c79:o, over the  <dig> ns simulation. the single-channel osmotic water permeability constant pf was obtained from  via dn  and yields a value ranging between  <dig> x10- <dig> cm3s- <dig> and  <dig> x10- <dig> cm3s- <dig> among the four monomers. averaging over the four monomers, a value of  x10- <dig> cm3s- <dig> is obtained. additional details are provided in table  <dig>

experimental measurements of the osmotic permeability of aqpm have been reported in terms of total membrane osmotic permeability constant  obtained from aqpm reconstituted into liposomes with values of  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig> μms- <dig>  <cit> . in order to compare these values to the single-channel water osmotic permeability  values obtained in this study, an estimation of pf from pf was made using the method of borgnia et al.  <cit>  to estimate the pf of aqpz  <cit> . the estimation consists in dividing pf by the number of channels per unit area . according to this, an experimentally derived estimate of the pf of aqpm is ≈  <dig> x10- <dig> cm3s- <dig>  this suggests that the pf value obtained from the aqpm md simulation presented here  x10- <dig> cm3s-1) overestimates the osmotic permeability of aqpm by a factor of ~  <dig>  interestingly this overestimation of pf from md simulations has already been observed for aqpz and other strict aquaporins and most notoriously for glpf  <cit> . in tables  <dig> and  <dig> we present results for water permeability obtained for aqpm, aqp <dig>  aqp <dig> and glpf from md simulations studies and experiments, respectively. the results in these tables show an apparent inverse relationship between experimental and md simulation derived results. glpf has been shown experimentally to be a slow water transporter. however in md simulation studies it appears to be a fast water transporter, with pf values equal or greater than those obtained for prototypical and well studied strict aquaporins like aqpz, aqp <dig> or aqp <dig>  <cit> . the cause of this discrepancy has been discussed and is attributed mainly to assumptions related to the forcefield and water model used for md simulations and on the difficulty to determine accurately the number of active channels present when estimating pf experimentally  <cit> .

an examination of the published md simulation results obtained for representative aquaporins from both sub-families, including aqpz  <cit>  and glpf  <cit>  from e.coli, and mammalian aqp <dig>  <cit>  and aqp <dig>  <cit> , revealed significant discrepancies on the values obtained for the osmotic and diffusive water permeability and the pf/pd ratio for the same aquaporin between different studies . these discrepancies may arise from the use of different force-fields, water models, simulation protocols, simulation times, and insufficient sampling due to the limited time scale of all-atom md simulations  <cit> . this issue together with the fact that only one representative from the aquaglyceroporins sub-family, glpf from e. coli, has been subjected to md-simulation studies, whereas four representatives from the strict aquaporins have been widely studied  exacerbates the problem of aquaporin sub-family comparisons in terms of water permeability and thus difficult the interpretation of the data obtained for newly described aquaporins such as aqpm in terms of water permeability. in an attempt to overcome these difficulties and to establish a clear point of reference, the present study of aqpm was performed using simulation protocols and analyses methods similar to those previously used in the study of aqpz and glpf  <cit> , including: i) the use of the same force-field , and water model , ii) similar simulation protocol , iii) similar simulation time  and temperature  and iv) the same md engine  . the comparison results in the following trend: pf  <pf <pf  indicating that the single channel osmotic water permeability of aqpm presents a value of pfthat is intermediate between those obtained for aqpz and glpf. as a whole, this evidence suggests that aqpm exhibits water osmotic permeability that is intermediate between strict aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins and thus could belong to a third sub-family of aquaporins.

single-channel diffusive water permeability constant
the single channel diffusive water permeability constant pd is another key feature that describes the water permeation mechanism of aquaporins, and is related to the number of water molecules that traverse the channel per unit time  <cit> . in the  <dig> ns simulation reported here, a total of  <dig> permeation events were observed , with n+ =  <dig> and n-=  <dig>  the accumulated number of permeation events grows linearly with time and the number of permeation events occurring in either direction is as expected, since in an equilibrium md simulation no net water flow should be present . then the unidirectional rate constant  was determined by using: k0=n±/2nmtsim, where n± is the number of accumulated bidirectional permeation events, tsim is the simulation time discarding the first ns  and nm represents the number of monomers . using k <dig>  and eq.  <dig>  a value of pd=  <dig>  x10- <dig> cm3s- <dig> was obtained for the aqpm tetramer. additional details and pd estimates for each monomer are provided in table  <dig> 

as noted for pf , different md simulation studies of the same aquaporin show significant discrepancies between the values obtained for pd . however, despite these discrepancies a trend is apparent, in which glpf appears with the highest pd values with respect to all other aquaporins including aqpm. the observation that the higher transport rate appears to be in an opposite trend with respect to experimental results can be explained by the wider pore of glpf that could allow more water-water interchanges and thus more permeation events per unit time, increasing the value of pd . as mentioned above for pf, this fact can be mainly attributed to the nature of md simulations, and specifically to the water model used, the van der waals parameters of the forcefield, and non-physical breathing movements of the channel. following the argument used for the comparison of pf values, we obtained for pd the same trend observed for pf <pd <pd. this result indicates that the single channel diffusive water permeability of aqpm presents values that are intermediate between those obtained for aqpz and glpf, using equivalent simulation methods  <cit> . this observation, together with the results observed for pf, provides the evidence to support the notion that aqpm could be a representative of a third aquaporin sub-family that exhibits properties that are intermediate between those of strict aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins.

pf / pd ratio
according to the continuous time random walk  model developed for single-file water transport  <cit> , the pf / pd ratio is related to the number of steps that a water molecule must perform in order to traverse the channel and follows the relation:  <cit>  were  is the average number of water molecules inside the channel. thus the pf /pd ratio can be used as a measure of the “single-fileness” of water movement inside the channel, and for a channel in which the water molecules are perfectly aligned in single file  <cit> . values of  indicates that the single-fileness of the water molecules inside the channel is interrupted by occasional water-water interchanges that increase pd, i.e., more water molecules traverse the channel per unit time  <cit> . water-water interchanges do not affect pf because the latter is related to the displacement of individual water molecules inside the channel and is not influenced by the occurrence of water-water interchanges. from the  <dig> ns simulation of the aqpm tetramer, we obtained  <dig>  <pf / pd <  <dig>  with an average value over the four monomers of pf / pd ≈  <dig>  and an average channel occupancy equal to  . these results suggest that water molecules move in single file in the aqpm channel with occasional water-water interchange events.

for aqpz , aqp <dig> and aqp <dig>  values of  have been reported, whereas for the aquaglyceroporin glpf  <cit> . this indicates that strict-aquaporins, with their narrower pore posses a more idealized single-file water transport mechanism. interestingly, this relation holds despite the aforementioned discrepancies between the values for pd and pf observed between different md-simulation studies. our results shows that, in terms of the pf / pd ratio, aqpm presents a similar level of single-fileness with respect to strict aquaporins  but with an average value of  suggesting that aqpm allows more water-water interchanges than strict aquaporins. this could be explained by the slightly wider ar/r region of aqpm due to the replacement of the his residue in position h <dig> conserved in strict aquaporins by the smaller and apolar ile residue.

channel occupancy
water occupancy histograms from the  <dig> ns simulation of the aqpm tetramer are shown for each monomer in figure  <dig>  and the averages are listed in table. <dig>  histograms were generated by counting the number of water molecules inside the constriction region  of each aqpm monomer for  <dig> snapshots separated by  <dig> ps taken from the  <dig> ns md simulation. the four monomers show a similar behaviour with their occupancy fluctuating closely around the tetramer average water occupancy  . the value of water occupancy reported here for aqpm is in agreement with results obtained from similar md simulations of other aquaporins   <cit>  and for water transport in carbon nanotubes of similar length  <cit>  in which a value of  was found.

channel radius
the channel radius of aqpm was computed using the hole program  <cit> . a total of  <dig> configurations separated by  <dig> ps of each aqpm monomer taken from the md simulation were considered, yielding an average channel radius of  <dig> ± <dig>  Å for the aqpm constriction region  . a plot of the radius profile obtained from the  <dig> ns simulation accompanied by a snapshot of the aqpm constriction region showing the conformation and position of relevant residues are presented in figure 5a and figure  <dig> b, respectively. the channel radius value reported here is in agreement with the channel radius measured from the x-ray structure of aqpm  <cit> . comparison of the channel radius profile obtained for aqpm with channel radius measurements with similar methods for other md-simulated aquaporins, shows that the aqpm channel exhibits an average radius similar to aqpz ≈  <dig>  Ǻ but is narrower than the average channel radius  of glpf  <cit> . as reported for other aquaporins  <cit> , the minimum radius of the aqpm channel is found at the extracellular side in the selectivity filter  or ar/r region composed of residues r202†, f <dig> and i <dig> with an average value of  <dig>  Å, close to the radius of a single water molecule. this narrowing of the pore at the sf, together with the small fluctuations  during the md simulation found on this region , suggest that only water and small neutral solutes with similar radius such as co <dig> or h2s could potentially pass through the selectivity filter of aqpm  <cit> . however, it has been shown recently that aqpm is not an h2s transporter  <cit> , thus more experimental and theoretical studies of aqpm are required to determine whether this aquaporin can transport other solutes through its channel.

water orientation
to measure the degree of ordering and orientation of water molecules inside the constriction region of aqpm, two order parameters  and , were measured. in both parameters θ is the angle between the unit vector approximately aligned along the channel axis/membrane normal, , and the water dipole vector. both parameters p <dig> and p <dig> serve as indications of the average alignment and orientation of the water dipole relative to the channel axis and thus permit the prediction of the water orientation inside aquaporin channels <cit> . the order parameter p <dig> ranges from - <dig> to  <dig>  and shows the average orientation of the water dipoles with respect to the channel axis . negative values indicate that the water dipoles are aligned parallel to the channel axis and pointing towards the intracellular side of the channel. positive values indicate that the water dipoles are aligned parallel to the channel axis and pointing towards the extracellular side of the channel. values of p <dig> near or equal to  <dig> indicate a perpendicular orientation of the water dipoles with respect to the channel axis. on the other hand p <dig>  ranges from - <dig>  to  <dig> and positive values indicates an average preferential alignment of the water dipoles parallel to the channel axis , and negative values are an indication of preferential alignment of the water dipole perpendicular to . as can be inferred from an inspection of figure  <dig>  water molecules appear to be highly ordered within the constriction region  of the aqpm pore and a bi-polar orientation of the water dipoles with a dipole inversion at the npa region can be observed, where both a minimum of p <dig>  and values near  <dig> for p <dig>  are found, indicating that water dipoles are oriented perpendicularly to the channel axis in this region. water molecules are aligned parallel to the channel axis on both sides of the npa motifs with their dipoles pointing towards the npa region. it has been suggested that the bi-polar orientation of water inside the pore of aquaporins is related to the blocking of proton passage through the channel and that could involve a hydrogen donor/hydrogen acceptor pattern that probably induce the dipole inversion around the npa motifs  <cit> . the nature of this bi-polar water orientation has been a matter of debate  <cit>  and the current hypothesis is that the bi-polar water orientation itself is not part of the proton blocking mechanism but rather is a signature, an indirect effect of the electrostatic field generated by the two macro-dipoles of the helical part of the re-entrant loops b and e. these macro-dipoles produce a concentration of positive charge in the npa region of the channel that generates an energetic barrier for protons blocking their passage through the pore  <cit> .

a bi-polar water orientation is clearly observed inside the aqpm constriction region in the course of our md simulation  and the hydrogen donor/hydrogen acceptor pattern appears to be formed by: i) the main chain carbonyl groups exposed to the channel lumen at both sides of the npa region provided by residues g <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig> on the extra-cellular side, and residues h <dig>  c <dig> on the intra-cellular side, that could act as hydrogen bond acceptors forming an hydrogen-bond ladder within the pore and ii) the asn residues at the npa region n <dig> and n <dig> that act as hydrogen bond donors. an increase in the values of p <dig> and negative values of p <dig> are observed in the sf of aqpm, indicating that water molecules in this region orient their dipoles perpendicular to the channel axis. this could reflect the interaction of water molecules with the polar hydrogen atoms arg202:hη and arg202:hε that causes a change in the dipole orientation of water molecules in this region. this interaction appears to be enhanced due to the narrowing of the channel in the sf of aqpm. thus the unique amino acid composition of the sf of aqpm appears to influence the water orientation in this zone of the channel. calculation of the same order parameters for other md-simulated aquaporins indicate that, in the case of strict aquaporins like aqpz and aqp <dig>  water molecules assume a more perpendicular orientation of their dipoles with respect to the channel axis around the sf due to the narrowing of the pore and the strong interaction between water molecules and the arg  and his  residues that comprise the sf of strict aquaporins  <cit> . on the other hand, the wider and hydrophobic sf of the aquaglyceroporin glpf allows more water-water interactions and thus favours a water dipole orientation parallel to the channel axis  <cit> .

structure / sequence comparisons
the average structure of aqpm was compared with the crystal structures of aqpz   <cit> , b-aqp <dig>  <cit>  , h-aqp <dig>  <cit>  and glpf   <cit>  using stamp  <cit> . fig.7a-c compares the view from the extracellular side of aqpm  with that of aqpz  and glpf ; the latter were selected as prototypical representatives of the strict aquaporin and aquaglyceroporin sub-families respectively.

as can be observed in figure  <dig>  there are significant differences between the compared aquaporins, regarding the residues that comprise their respective sfs and their spatial arrangement . of particular interest, is the residue that occupies position h <dig> . in aqpz, b-aqp <dig> and h-aqp <dig> this position is occupied by a his residue conserved among strict aquaporins  <cit> . in glpf and other aquaglyceroporins position h <dig> is occupied by a gly, a feature that allows the formation of the so-called “hydrophobic corner” by trp <dig>  in position h <dig> and phe <dig>  in position le <dig> that allows the accommodation of a glycerol molecule  <cit> . in aqpm, position h <dig> is occupied by ile , whereas in the other archaeal aquaporins it is occupied either by ile, val or leu  <cit>  generating an sf that is narrower than the sf of aquaglyceroporins but wider and less polar than the sf of strict aquaporins. thus, the sf of aqpm can be viewed as a slightly wider and more-hydrophobic version of the sf from strict aquaporins. regarding the hydrophobic residues that line the pore below the sf , it is interesting to note that among the compared aquaporins these residues correspond to val, ile or leu, except for aqpz that has two aromatic residues instead in two of these nine positions. these considerations underscore the notion that differences in water permeability between aquaporins are most likely related to the size and polarity of the sf resulting from differences in critically located amino acids. aqpm, with its unique sf, clearly differs from the two other sub-families, exhibiting characteristics that are hybrid between an aquaglyceroporin such as glpf and a strict aquaporins like aqpz. whether this differences permits aqpm to carry out different functions or whether it is just a “molecular fossil” representing an early stage in the evolution of the other aquaporins, as previously suggested  <cit> , is an issue that remains to be determined. however, the apparent absence of aquaporin genes in a large number of microbial genomes  <cit> , together with the assertion that given the small size and resultant large surface-to-volume ratio of individual microbial cells, lipid membranes are sufficiently permeable to support growth without water channels that enhance water permeability  <cit> , have opened the debate about possible alternative roles for microbial aquaporins other than simple water transport. these potential roles include osmotic and turgor sensors  <cit> , involvement in freeze tolerance mechanisms  <cit>  and transport of other neutral solutes such as co <dig>  h2s, nh <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have performed the first molecular dynamics simulation of the archaeal aquaporin aqpm, the most studied representative of a new group of aquaporins that are not easily classifiable within the current functional sub-families of aquaporins. from our md simulation we have provided estimations for key biophysical parameters of aqpm including: single channel osmotic permeability constant , single channel diffusive permeability constant , channel radius, potential water occupancy of the channel and water orientation inside the pore. the results obtained from the md simulations of aqpm were compared with those obtained by similar simulation methods for the well characterized microbial representatives of the two main aquaporin sub-families, aqpz and glpf, a strict aquaporin and an aquaglyceroporin respectively. our results extend the evidence that the size and polarity of the residues that comprise the sf of aquaporins control much of the selectivity and water permeability of aquaporins and supports the notion that aqpm belongs to a third class of aquaporins that exhibits properties that are intermediate between those of the other two classes. however, it is clear that more experimental and theoretical evidence is needed to assess whether this third class of aquaporins differs from the other sub-families in other functional aspect besides water permeability rates i.e., if it exhibits permeability to other uncharged solutes, related to the specific life style of the organisms in which they are found or whether it could represent an earlier evolutionary form, a molecular fossil, which existed before the divergence of the other two sub-families.
