BACKGROUND
ribonucleases  have long been used as biochemical models of enzymology and protein folding, and also as models for molecular phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses  <cit> . the rnase a and rnase t <dig> families are among those better characterized. the acidic ribonuclease rnase t <dig> was first purified from aspergillus oryzae and characterized by sato and egami  <cit> . the rnase t <dig> superfamily is widespread  <cit> , with members in almost all organisms analyzed to date, including bacteria, fungi, plants, animals and even viruses. rnase t <dig> enzymes are secreted rnases without base specificity, and they can degrade all types of single-stranded rna  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of this family has been carried out extensively in plants, in particular in models of evolution of gametophytic self-incompatibility  <cit>  because a subclass of the rnase t <dig> family, the s-rnases, is involved in this process. the t <dig> family has expanded and diversified in plants, and each angiosperm genome sequenced so far contains five or more genes belonging to this family . these genes are classified as s-rnases or as s-like rnases, depending on whether they are involved in the self-incompatibility process or not  <cit> . a nutritional role as phosphate scavengers and defense roles as antibacterial, antifungal, or antiviral agents are among the functions proposed for s-like rnases  <cit> .

in animals, the vertebrate-specific rnase a superfamily has been exhaustively studied  <cit> . rnase a enzymes are secreted proteins with pyrimidine base-specificity that can degrade any kind of single stranded rna, and in some cases double stranded rna  <cit> . this family has also been used in a variety of evolutionary studies, from mammalian and vertebrate phylogenetics  <cit>  to analyses of evolution of novel gene functions after gene duplications  <cit> . among the biological functions assigned to rnase a family members are nutrition, as a phosphate and nitrogen scavenger in the gut  <cit> , and defense, due to antibacterial and antiviral properties  <cit> . these functions are similar to those assigned to rnase t <dig> members in plants. in addition, while some enzymatic differences exist between these two families, the main substrate seems to be similar.

the rnase t <dig> family has experienced a large expansion and diversification in plants;  <cit> , and a parallel can be drawn to the rnase a family expansion in vertebrates  <cit> . in spite of these similarities, rnase a members have not been able to completely replace rnase t <dig> functions in vertebrates, since at least one gene belonging to the latter family has been found in each animal genome completely sequenced.

to gain insights on the evolution and coexistence of these rnase families we analyzed rnase t <dig> members found in the zebrafish  genome. we chose this organism because its genome has been completely sequenced, and all developmental stages, from early embryo to adult, can be easily obtained. in addition, well-detailed analyses of zebrafish rnase a genes have been recently published  <cit> . here we show that the zebrafish genome contains two rnase t <dig> genes. expression of rnase t <dig> genes in all adult and embryo tissues suggests that this family of rnases have a housekeeping function, in contrast to the roles of rnase a, which are tissue- and stress-specific. in addition high rnase t <dig> embryo expression is conserved in various eukaryotes, both plant and animals, suggesting that an embryo specific function could also be important to maintain this family's presence in vertebrates even after rnase a genes appeared.

RESULTS
rnase t <dig> enzymes are present in zebrafish
although early studies detected only faint rnase activity in fish organ extracts  <cit> , an rnase t <dig> with acidic ph preference was recently isolated from salmon liver  <cit> . to identify rnase activities in zebrafish extracts we used a standard in gel activity assay that allows size separation of different proteins with rnase activity, as well as characterization of ph preference. adult zebrafish of mixed sexes were separated into "body" , "head"  and "guts" . crude extracts were then analyzed for rnase activities . at neutral ph we identified only weak activities in the molecular weight range of rnase a . however, at an acidic ph we also observed stronger activities in the 20– <dig> kda range that could correspond to rnase t <dig> enzymes. while body and head extracts clearly showed all activities, gut extracts did not show any detectable rnase activity in the conditions assayed. this result is not due to general protein degradation since protein integrity seems evident in a coomassie stained sds-page .

identification of several bands in the rnase a range was consistent with the four rnase a genes found in the zebrafish genome  <cit> . thus, several bands in the rnase t <dig> range suggested that the zebrafish genome also contained more than one rnase t <dig> gene. a blastp  <cit>  search against the protein prediction database of the current zebrafish genome assembly  using the rnase ok <dig> sequence from salmon  <cit>  identified two proteins with homology to rnase t <dig> enzymes, one located in chromosome  <dig> and the other in chromosome  <dig>  additional searches using these two proteins , or the corresponding nucleotide sequences  against the full genome assembly and available ests failed to identify any additional sequences corresponding to rnase t <dig> homologs.

the two proteins contain conserved amino acid sequences  characteristic of the rnase t <dig> family, which include the his residues  essential for rnase activity. they also have conserved cys residues important for establishment of tertiary structure, and other residues conserved in most rnase t <dig> homologs  <cit> . we named these enzymes rnase dre <dig>  and rnase dre <dig> . molecular weights of the predicted mature peptides are  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda for the two forms of rnase dre <dig>  and  <dig>  kda for rnase dre <dig>  in addition, four n-glycosylation sites are predicted for rnase dre <dig> and two for rnase dre <dig>  incomplete glycosylation of the proteins at these sites could account for all the bands in the 20– <dig> kda range observed in the activity gels shown in figure  <dig> 

using rt-pcr we cloned cdnas corresponding to both genes, and confirmed the sequence of the predicted proteins. both predicted proteins appear to have signal peptides that may direct them to the secretory pathway. based on the sequence of the predicted mature peptides, the identity between rnase dre <dig> and rnase dre <dig> is only 31%; in fact rnase dre <dig> is more similar to rnaset <dig>  the human rnase t <dig> homolog , while rnase dre <dig> is only 26% identical to rnaset <dig>  on the other hand, both proteins are 22%  and 19%  identical to rnase t <dig> from aspergillus oryzae, the prototypic rnase of the family <cit> . analysis of genomic organization  showed that rnase dre <dig> has  <dig> exons, while rnase dre <dig> has  <dig>  although the coding regions for both genes are contained in  <dig> exons.

during cloning we observed that rnase dre <dig> rt-pcr showed two different bands, with less than  <dig> bp difference in size. cloning and sequencing of individual bands  resulted in the identification of an alternative splicing variant. the presence of the alternative exon of  <dig> nt in the mrna  results in a longer mrna. the expression of both mrna species was confirmed by northern blots . this extra exon also results in a change in the open reading frame, which in turns changes the start codon position. thus, the short mrna species produces a longer peptide, while the long mrna produces a shorter one. this change only affects the signal peptide . subcellular localization prediction programs predict that both isoforms of rnase dre <dig>  as well as rnase dre <dig>  contain a signal peptide that target the proteins to the secretory pathway, as is the norm for most members of the rnase t <dig> family. however, the putative signal peptide in the shorter rnase dre <dig> protein includes sequences that are highly conserved in all rnase t <dig> proteins, suggesting that this putative peptide might not be cleaved, or that it could result in a non-functional protein.

rnase dre <dig> and rnase dre <dig> are expressed in adult and embryo tissues
to determine when and where the two rnase t <dig> genes were expressed, we used semi-quantitative rt-pcr. adult fish tissues were dissected and total rna was isolated. to be able to compare rnase dre <dig> and rnase dre <dig> expression with that of rnase a genes, we used the same tissues utilized in the analysis by cho and zhang  <cit> . these included brain, eye, heart, liver, gut, muscle, ovary, testis and skin. rnase dre <dig> was expressed in all organs, and a stronger signal was detected in reproductive organs . rnase dre <dig> was not detected in liver and the signal was weak in eye, ovary and skin under the conditions of our experiment. these expression patterns contrast with those observed for rnase a homologs, which are expressed almost exclusively in liver and gut tissues, and weakly in heart , or brain . it is important to note that while expression of rnase dre <dig> and rnase dre <dig> is clearly detected in several internal organs, rnase activity is not easily detected in "guts" extracts . further characterization of these extracts indicated that although rnase activities are present, they are degraded by proteases that seem to have a certain amount of specificity, since most proteins in gut extracts seem unaltered after coomassie blue staining .

analysis of expression in whole embryos during developmental stages was also performed . strong expression of rnase dre <dig> was observed during all developmental stages analyzed , with a peak of expression at  <dig> hours. rnase dre <dig> was also detected in all developmental stages and peaked at  <dig> h, although the signal was lower at  <dig> and  <dig> h. in contrast, only one of the rnase a homologs, zf-rnase- <dig>  is expressed in early embryo tissues  <cit> . analysis of rnase activity in embryo extracts showed a pattern consistent with mrna expression results. only rnase activities in the 20– <dig> kda range were detected, and only in acidic conditions .

to further confirm that rnase dre <dig> and rnase dre <dig> are expressed in zebrafish embryos, we performed in situ hybridization analyses . as expected, both mrnas were detected in all the embryo stages studied. at the one cell stage  transcripts corresponding to both rnases localized mainly to the animal pole, or the part of the cell that will contribute to the embryo proper. it was also possible to observe rna projections in structures that resemble cytoskeletal arrangements extending from the animal pole toward the vegetal pole associated with axial streaming of ooplasm  <cit> . these structures could correspond to rna being recruited to the embryo from the extraembryonic yolky cytoplasm  <cit> . at the 16-cell stage  both rnas gave a strong signal in blastomeres. twenty six-hour embryos  showed strong expression throughout the embryo, and only rnase dre <dig> showed weak expression in yolk, with both rnases most highly expressed in eyes.

rnase t <dig> enzymes are also expressed in embryos of other organisms
to investigate whether other rnase t <dig> homologs also have a role during embryo development we analyzed expression of genes belonging to this family using available microarray data from public databases. cerns, the only rnase t <dig> homolog gene in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans genome is also expressed during embryo development . microarray data also indicated that cerns is not expressed in adult tissues . in situ hybridization results obtained from the nematode expression pattern database  confirmed the expression pattern of cerns obtained from microarray databases. cerns embryo expression seems to be ubiquitous, as is the case for rnase dre <dig> and rnase dre <dig>  in addition, analysis of expression data representing  <dig> mouse tissues  <cit>  showed that the only rnase t <dig> homolog present in the mouse genome was also detected in embryonic samples . remarkably, embryo expression is not limited to animals. according to microarray data  <cit> , rns <dig>  one of five members of the rnase t <dig> family present in the plant arabidopsis thaliana, is one of the most highly expressed genes  during embryo development .

rnase dre <dig> represents a gene duplication present only in ray-finned and cartilaginous fishes
in order to understand the evolution of rnase t <dig> genes in fish and other animals, we searched for sequences belonging to this family in est and protein databases. we also analyzed the fully sequenced genomes of the ray-finned fishes medaka , spotted green pufferfish , and fugu . in these three genomes we identified two genes in each species belonging to the rnase t <dig> family, as in the zebrafish genome, although only one in each case was also represented in est collections. additional sequences belonging to this family were found in est collections for other fish species, including sharks, lamprey and hagfish .

among the many rnase t <dig> sequences available from other organisms, we selected several sequences from vertebrates , an urochordate, a cephalochordate, an echinoderm, nematodes, a trematode and an insect to generate a protein neighbor-joining tree of animal rnases . proteins from plants , bacteria , protozoa  and fungi  were included to identify the relationship of animal rnases with other proteins in the rnase t <dig> superfamily.

the tree allowed us to make several inferences on the evolution of the rnase t <dig> family in animals. fish rnases cluster in two well defined clades, one represented by rnase dre <dig> and the other by rnase dre <dig> . evidence for genes belonging to the two clades was found in all fully sequenced fish genomes by blast searches, although only those with est support were included in the tree shown in figure  <dig>  because a clear gene model for the other genes was not available. all the fish species for which full genome sequence is available contain only one gene from each clade. similarly, only one sequence for each clade was found in several fish est collections with the exception of the brook trout , in which a recent duplication gave rise to two copies of the rnase dre <dig> homolog .

the presence of genes from the two clades in chondrichthyes  and actinopterygii  indicates an ancient origin for the gene duplication that gave rise to these two clades, with the two genes present at least in the last common ancestor of the two classes more than  <dig> mya  <cit> . analysis of sequence data from earlier chordata, including sea squirt , amphioxus , hagfish , and lamprey  identified only one gene belonging to the rnase t <dig> family in each species. since the amphioxus genome has been completely sequenced  <cit> , the presence of only one gene would indicate that the gene duplication occurred after the separation of the cephalochordata from the main chordata stem. since genome coverage for the other species is limited, the exact timing for the gene duplication leading to the two rnase clades cannot be precisely determined. moderate bootstrap support  for the rnase dre <dig> clade suggests that the duplication the predated the divergence of lampreys and hagfishes from jawed vertebrates. however, this result could also mean that the genes in the rnase dre <dig> clade conserved more ancestral characteristics than rnase dre <dig> after duplication.

genes belonging to the rnase dre <dig> clade were found in all vertebrates analyzed, from hagfish to human. however, rnase dre <dig> clade genes were found only in cartilaginous and bony fishes, but not in other vertebrates. exhaustive analysis of the fully sequenced human and mouse genomes failed to identify rnase dre <dig> genes. interestingly, an rnase t <dig> pseudogene was found in each of these two genomes , but in both cases the pseudogene also belonged to the rnase dre <dig> clade . these results suggest that the rnase dre <dig> gene was present at least in the last common ancestor of actinopterygii  and sarcopterygii  but was lost in tetrapods after they diverged.

the recent characterization of rnase ok <dig>  <cit>  showed that in this protein, a commonly conserved his residue in cas ii  is mutated to tyr. this change most likely affects the catalytic properties of the enzyme and results in lower specific activity  <cit> . our results showed that the same mutation is found in all teleostei  , but not in sturgeon , sea lamprey , and dogfish shark , nor in other vertebrates outside fish, suggesting that the mutation appeared and was fixed at the base of this taxon or after the separation of actinopterygii  and sarcopterygii . interestingly, the same mutation was found in rnase ebu <dig> from inshore hagfish, and it is most likely the result of an independent mutation that was fixed in this species .

remarkably, all analyzed genes belonging to the rnase dre <dig> clade also showed mutations in the same position . in this case the canonical his residue characteristic of other rnase t <dig> enzymes is replaced by a series of charged or polar amino acids: glu, asp, gln, or asn. since all genes in this subfamily have substitutions in this position, the loss of the his residue seems to have happened soon after the duplication event that gave rise to the rnase dre <dig> clade. although no mutagenesis experiments have been carried out to show the effect of these mutations, some s-rnases have similar substitutions . s-rnases have low specific activity compared with other rnase t <dig> enzymes, and such characteristic has been attributed to the lack of this particular his residue  <cit> ; however, they are still active, and this activity is essential for their biological function. since the amino acid substitutions in this position in s-rnases and rnase dre <dig> homologs are the same, it is expected that the changes observed in rnase dre <dig> homologs also reduce, but not eliminate, the specific activity of these enzymes.

discussion
ribonucleases from the rnase a and rnase t <dig> family have been frequently used as models for the study of evolution of gene function. these two types of rnases have similar enzymatic activity and substrate preferences, both being endoribonucleases that mainly hydrolyze bulk single stranded rna. both families are also found mainly in extracellular space or associated with the secretory pathway. while the rnase a family is vertebrate specific  <cit> , the rnase t <dig> family is widespread and members of this family has been found is almost all eukaryotic and many prokaryotic genomes  <cit> . thus, in spite of this seemingly redundant activity, both enzyme families coexist in vertebrates. evolution and biological function of rnase t <dig> proteins have been studied mostly in plants  <cit> ; although recent reports of an association of human rnase t <dig> with cancer have spiked interest in this protein  <cit> .

in this work we characterized the two rnase t <dig> genes present in the zebrafish genome. a recent analysis of rnase a genes from this fish suggests that the available genome sequence may not be complete, as at least one rnase a gene found in cdna libraries is not found in the genome  <cit> . however, based on the lack of any other rnase t <dig> sequence in zebrafish cdna collections, the presence of only two genes in the other fully sequenced fish genomes, and our phylogenetic analysis, we feel confident that only two rnase t <dig> genes are present in the zebrafish genome.

we were able to detect ribonuclease activities in zebrafish extracts that show the molecular weight and enzymatic properties expected for the proteins encoded by rnase dre <dig> and rnase dre <dig>  in addition, the conservation of the active site residues, and the high sequence similarity between the zebrafish rnases and rnase ok <dig> , which was shown to be an active ribonuclease by purification from salmon liver  <cit>  strongly suggest that rnase dre <dig> and rnase dre <dig> are active ribonucleases.

fish seem unusual among animals because in all species analyzed there were two genes belonging to the rnase t <dig> family, unlike all other animals in which only one gene has been found. genomic data indicate that a whole genome duplication event  occurred in the fish lineage after the separation of teleosts from the main tetrapod stem. this wgd explains the occurrence of many ray-finned fish-specific gene duplications  <cit> . however, this wgd is proposed to have occurred after the separation of the acipenseriformes and the semionotiformes from the lineage leading to teleost fish, but before the divergence of osteoglossiformes  <cit> . thus, the gene duplication event that gave rise to both rnase t <dig> genes present in fish genomes cannot correspond to this ray-finned fish-specific wgd, since genes corresponding to the rnase dre <dig> and rnase dre <dig> clades were found in sturgeons  and sharks .

in contrast, the lack of rnase dre <dig> orthologs in all tetrapods indicates that this gene was lost in this lineage soon after the separation from the actinopterigii. moreover, any duplicated gene produced by the wgd that occurred in the fish lineage was also lost. interestingly, according to cho and zhang  <cit> , rnase a genes may have appeared in the chordate lineage in the last common ancestor of these two groups. while the success of this new gene family was mixed in ray-finned fish , it has been successfully maintained and underwent a large diversification in tetrapods. in plants, where no rnase a genes exist, rnase t <dig> genes have radiated and diversified to a greater extent, in a way similar to that observed for the rnase a family in animals . thus, it is tempting to hypothesize that the presence of rnase a genes influenced the evolution of the rnase t <dig> family in ray-finned fish and tetrapods .

this hypothesis could be supported by a series of observations. plant rnase t <dig> genes and vertebrate rnase a genes show patterns of gene sorting  <cit>  such as the presence of different gene numbers in different species and the lack of clear orthologs among species. in contrast, vertebrate rnase t <dig> genes form two monophyletic groups, one exclusive to fish, and the other including all vertebrates .

the functions acquired by duplicated genes after extensive radiation seem to be similar for the two types of enzymes in plants and animals; i.e., the biological roles assigned to many rnase a proteins in animals are similar to those of rnase t <dig> proteins in plants. for example, several members of the rnase a family have antimicrobial properties. eosinophil associated rnases have antiviral  and antibacterial  function, and angiogenin and rnase  <dig> have antibacterial and antifungal activities <cit> . similarly, plant rnase t <dig> proteins inhibit hyphal elongation of the pathogenic oomycete phytophthora parasitica  <cit> , and are induced by viral and fungal pathogens  <cit> . in addition, both animal rnase a and plant rnase t <dig> enzymes have cytotoxic properties, for example frog oocyte rnases used as anticancer drugs  <cit> , and flower s-rnases that reject pollen during self-incompatible pollination  <cit> . the cytotoxic properties of these enzymes are probably as a consequence of their role in defense, as in the case of frog oocyte rnases  <cit> , or have evolved from a defensive role, as in the case of s-rnases  <cit> . a nutritional role has also been proposed for plant rnase t <dig> and animal rnase a enzymes. rnase a is secreted into the mammalian intestine where it helps digest rna from gut bacteria to recover nutrients  <cit> ; while expression of plant rnase t <dig> enzymes is induced when phosphate in the soil is limited  <cit> as part of a phosphate scavenging system  <cit> .

finally, most plant rnase t <dig> enzymes and vertebrate rnase a enzymes show strong tissue specificity and lack of expression in early embryos, suggesting that they are involved in immune and stress responses rather than having a housekeeping role  <cit> . on the other hand, animal rnase t <dig> enzymes, and a few plant ones like arabidopsis rns <dig>  <cit>  , seem to be constitutively expressed, suggesting that they could have a housekeeping function. this function, conserved through evolution, could be responsible for the conservation of the rnase t <dig> family in animals, in spite of the presence of rnase a.

we hypothesize that the role of rnase t <dig> enzymes could be to recycle bulk rna  throughout the life of the cell, and not only in times of nutrient deprivation as has been proposed before. rna is an important source of p and n, and turnover of this molecule should be important for p and n homeostasis. accordingly, some rnase t <dig> enzymes have been found in intracellular compartments, supporting the idea of a role recycling rna in normal cells. for example, human rnaset <dig> has been found to accumulate in the lysosome  <cit> , while arabidopsis rns <dig> is present in intracellular fractions, probably associated to the vacuole or the er  <cit> . in the case of zebrafish rnase dre <dig> and rnase dre <dig> the localization is unknown, but subcellular localization predictions using different programs  indicate either extracellular or microsomal/lysosomal localization, almost identical to predictions for the human enzyme. it is interesting to note that the alternative splicing observed for rnase dre <dig> alters the protein's signal peptide, opening the possibility that this protein localizes to different subcellular compartments. alternative processing resulting in different subcellular localizations has already been described for tomato ribonucleases  <cit> .

the high level of expression of rnase t <dig> enzymes in embryonic tissues is also notable. this pattern could also be a consequence of the proposed housekeeping role for rnase t2s. the high metabolic activity of embryos could demand a high level of rnase activity to process cellular material as it is being renewed. alternatively, we could look for other explanations for the embryonic role of rnase t <dig> enzymes. a highly speculative but attractive idea is that secreted rnases can control the activity of small rnas  <cit> .

following this rationale, we could speculate that the embryonic role of rnase t <dig> enzymes is to shield embryonic tissues from unwanted small rnas. in plants, rna silencing is reset in each generation  <cit> . this property of silencing was shown for virus induced gene silencing  and posttranscriptional gene silencing . arabidopsis rns <dig> is one of the most highly expressed genes during all the stages of embryo development. importantly, rns <dig> is secreted to the apoplastic space  <cit> . it has been shown that the outer integument of the developing seed can provide a symplastic route for transport from maternal tissues to the developing seed, but the transfer between the outer integument and the inner integument and between the integument and the embryo are apoplastic  <cit> . thus, any rna signal would have to travel through the apoplast to reach the embryo would find a barrier due to accumulation of rns <dig>  in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans it has been shown that phenotypes induced by rnai can last only for two or three generations  <cit> , and only a small subset of genes  that could be inheritably silenced for longer periods of time  <cit> . these results suggest that transmission of silencing from maternal to embryonic tissues could be regulated also in animals. in this context, secreted rnases would form a rna surveillance field  <cit> , that stops the spreading of small rnas.

in summary, it seems possible that the emergence of rnase a affected the evolution of rnase t <dig> proteins in animals. the smaller size of rnase a proteins, which could be more energetically favorable, could favor the use of this protein instead of rnase t <dig> proteins for defense roles in animals. however, rnase t <dig> proteins have not been completely replaced in animals, most likely because they also have a housekeeping function in an intracellular compartment that cannot be carried out by rnase a.

CONCLUSIONS
the zebrafish genome contains two rnase t <dig> genes, rnase dre <dig> and rnase dre <dig>  these genes are part of two phylogenetic clades, one conserved in all chordates , and another fish-specific . expression analyses indicate that rnase dre <dig> is present in all tissues and developmental stages in zebrafish, suggesting a housekeeping role for these enzymes. this idea is further supported by the conservation of rnase t <dig> genes in all the genomes analyzed. analyses of the evolution of the rnase t <dig> family in animals, and comparisons with the evolution of rnase t <dig> in plants and rnase a in vertebrates suggest that the emergence of rnase a affected the evolution of rnase t <dig> proteins in animals.
