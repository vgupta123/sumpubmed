BACKGROUND
commercial apple  production relies on the use of dwarfing rootstocks to reduce scion vigour and promote early flowering in young trees  <cit> . however, the closely related pear  lacks comparable dwarfing pyrus rootstocks, which makes the cultivation of pear currently less profitable than apple. to develop a series of pear rootstocks, it is necessary first to develop an understanding of the mechanisms involved in vigour control and precocity in pear and the genetic determinants of the desired traits.

the physiology of rootstock-induced dwarfing in fruit trees is not fully understood and a number of mechanisms have been suggested to influence dwarfing in perennial fruit tree crops in general. yonemoto et al.  <cit>  observed that mandarin scions grafted onto rootstocks had a lower sap flow rate and higher soluble solid content than non-grafted trees and basile et al.  <cit>  found that the daily extension growth of shoots of a peach scion grafted on a semi-dwarfing rootstock was related to the dynamics of stem water potential. in citrus, lliso et al.  <cit>  found significantly higher concentrations of carbohydrates in fruit and roots of trees on dwarfing rootstocks than on more vigorous ones, suggesting that dwarfing rootstocks promote heavier flowering and crop load and thereby reduce vegetative growth. in apple, research has focused on water and nutrient restriction at the graft union, as well as a reduction of auxin movement from the scion to the rootstock . foster et al.  <cit>  observed that key flowering genes from the flowering time  locus family were up-regulated in dwarfing rootstocks, which would promote flowering and reduce shoot extension growth.

they also found several stress response genes were up-regulated and concluded that stress might be a factor in the dwarfing effect. recently, two major qtls , which control most of the dwarfing effect conferred to the scion, have been identified in the apple rootstock ‘malling 9’  on lg <dig> and lg <dig> respectively, . this ‘m9’ dwarfing effect involves the reduction of the number and length of branches in the first year of growth after grafting and an increase in the proportion of floral buds  <cit> . however, in pear no qtl has been identified that controls tree productivity traits and no genetic analysis has been carried out on rootstocks, although several qtls have been identified that control traits such as pest and disease resistance , leaf morphology  <cit> , and fruit quality traits .

as pear and apple are closely related species within the rosaceae family  <cit> , and their genomes exhibit a high degree of synteny , we hypothesized that orthologous loci might occur in both pear and apple that are responsible for the control of scion growth conferred by rootstocks. in the present study, we tested this hypothesis using a segregating population of  <dig> seedlings from a p. communis ‘old home’ x ‘louise bonne de jersey’ cross grafted with ‘doyenne du comice’  scions and phenotyped for precocity and scion growth . we present the results for a qtl analysis of these traits using a high density genetic map based on single nucleotide polymorphism  markers anchored to the ‘bartlett’ v <dig>  european pear genome assembly  <cit> .

methods
segregating population
a cross was made between pyrus communis l. ‘old home’ and ‘louise bonne de jersey’ , resulting in a segregating population consisting of 421 f <dig> seedlings. the seedlings were grown in the glasshouse for three months and planted out into the plant & food research orchard in motueka, new zealand . after  <dig> months of acclimatisation, the seedlings were summer budded with ‘comice’ . in the following spring when the trees were cut down to the bud, grafts from the shoots removed from the ohxlbj seedlings were inserted onto pyrus calleryana seedling rootstocks to provide leaf material for dna extraction. as controls, fifty clonal cydonia oblonga ‘quince c’  rootstocks grafted with ‘comice’ were systematically distributed throughout the orchard block to give some indication of the variation in growing conditions across the block. the trees were planted into three rows, each containing  <dig> trees, including the qc controls, with a spacing of  <dig>  m within the row and  <dig>  m between the rows. of the original  <dig> seedlings, propagation of scions failed on  <dig> trees, leaving  <dig> for phenotyping. to avoid any horticultural influence on tree shape and vigour, the trees were neither pruned nor trained. once the trees began to flower and crop, all fruit were removed from the trees each season after first drop to avoid biennial bearing, bending of the branches  and a confounding effect of the crop on tree vigour. drip irrigation, fertilisation and pest and disease control were carried out; woven plastic mat was laid down to repress weed growth.

architectural measurements and inflorescence assessment
scions were phenotyped for architectural traits for the first four years of growth after grafting  . detailed architectural measurements were taken after growth cessation  in years 1– <dig>  including trunk cross-sectional area  20 cm above the graft union; length of main axis ; and number of branches and spurs  . branches were classified as either sylleptic shoots, which extend in the same year they are initiated, or proleptic shoots, which extend after winter dormancy  <cit> .table  <dig> architectural measurements taken over the first four years of growth after grafting

measurements were taken for ohxlbj pear rootstock segregating population and quince c  controls grafted with scions of ‘comice’. tca trunk cross-sectional area, spurs are short shoots . the designation for the variables used for qtl analysis is indicated between brackets



in year  <dig>  the tree canopies were visually categorised as being small, moderate or vigorous, using qc controls as models for moderate tree growth. an example for the three vigour classifications can be seen in fig.  <dig>  the presence or absence of root suckers was recorded in the third year. the first inflorescence assessment was done at the beginning of year  <dig> and repeated in the following two springs. no ‘comice’ scions flowered either on the seedlings or on qc control rootstocks in year  <dig>  in year  <dig>  the total number of inflorescences was counted and their positions recorded; this was repeated in year  <dig>  at the beginning of year  <dig>  the proportions of inflorescence production were estimated according to the size of the tree, relative to the tree with the highest number of inflorescences. the trees were ranked into classes from 0– <dig>  with 0 = no flowers, 1 = 1–25 %, 2 = 26–50 %, 3 = 51–75 %, 4 = 76–100 %.fig.  <dig> examples of three vigour classes of trees in the second year of growth after grafting. trees shown are 1) small, 2) moderate, 3) vigorous ‘old home’ x ‘louise bonne de jersey’ pear rootstocks grafted with ‘comice’. the wires indicate the height of the trees, with the wire being  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  m from the ground, lowest to the top respectively



data analysis
univariate mixed models were fitted to the data with row and a linear effect of tree position in the row as fixed effects, and genotype as the only random effect. localized spatial trends were modelled by fitting first-order auto-correlations for tree positions  <cit> . the fixed effects were chosen based on an examination of the variograms when fitting the first-order auto-correlations to both row and tree position, and the auto-correlations to retain were based on likelihood ratio tests. having determined the optimal univariate model, it was then extended to bivariate models for every pairwise set of variates. these bivariate models allowed for separate fixed and spatial effects for each variate, and also a different genetic variance for each, as well as the genetic correlation. predicted values from these bivariate analyses were used in the qtl analysis. data from each year were analysed separately, in order to check whether the putative qtls were stable across years. residual plots were examined to check for outliers and assess the validity of the normality assumption. for all variates apart from branches_year <dig>  a square-root transformation was used to obtain a satisfactory approximation to normality. basic statistical analysis was carried out using minitab  <dig> statistical software . all further analysis were conducted using r  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , and the mixed models were fitted using the asreml package version  <dig> - <dig>  <cit> .

genetic mapping and qtl analysis
dna was extracted using a ctab method  <cit> , followed by purification with nucleospin® columns . dna was quantified using a nanodrop™ 2000c spectrophotometer . snp marker genotyping was performed using the apple and pear infinium® ii irsc 9 k snp array  <cit>  on  <dig> segregating individuals and both parents. genomic dna was amplified and hybridized to the apple and pear infinium® ii irsc 9 k snp array following the infinium® hd assay ultra protocol  and scanned with the illumina hiscan. data were analysed using illumina’s genomestudio v  <dig>  software and genetic mapping carried out using joinmap 3®  <cit> . a lod score of  <dig> or higher was used for grouping and the genetic distance within the group was calculated using the kosambi function. the linkage groups  were identified by aligning the parental maps of oh and lbj to the map developed by montanari et al. , which contains apple and pear ssr markers from the ‘bartlett’ consensus map of celton et al.  <cit> . the map was drawn and aligned using mapchart v. <dig>   <cit> . the parental genetic maps were used with raw and transformed phenotypic data of tree growth, precocity and suckering for qtl analysis employing mapqtl <dig>  <cit> . for normally distributed data, interval mapping  followed by multiple qtl mapping  was performed and a permutation test  was used to calculate the lod threshold for qtl significance. anova was used to calculate the percentage of the phenotypic variance explained by each qtl. when normalisation of the data failed, the kruskal-wallis test was used for qtl detection.

identification of the dwarfing allelotype in a pear germplasm selection
the ssr marker hi01c <dig>  developed by silfverberg-dilworth et al.  <cit>  and identified as the proximal flanking marker for the dw <dig> region on lg <dig> of apple  <cit>  was screened over  <dig> individuals of the ohxlbj population to determine the linkage phase between the qtl and the ssr alleles. pcr amplification was carried out using a modified version of the fluorescent m <dig> universal primer system  <cit>  and a touchdown pcr programme with annealing temperature 60–55 °c ; 72 °c/1 min 30 s; 30 cycles: 94 °c/55 s, 55 °c/55 s, 72 °c/1 min 30 s; 72 °c/10 min). the fragments were separated using the abi <dig> sequencer, and their size analysed with genemarker® v  <dig> . <dig> software . the marker was then included in the oh map. the allele sizes were compared with those detected by screening the same ssr marker over  <dig> pear accessions from selections of germplasm from france, new zealand, germany and the usa, including oh and lbj.

finding orthologous loci in pear and apple
apple and european pear regions were compared to identify orthologous genes using orthomcl <dig> . <dig>   <cit> . synteny gene blocks were detected with orthocluster  <cit> . pyrus scaffolds were aligned to malus scaffolds using the mummer  <dig>  package  <cit> . pear scaffolds were further filtered based on having at least two alignments, each alignment longer than 2kbp or total alignment length not shorter than 3kbp.

RESULTS
architectural measurements
architectural measurements were taken on ‘comice’ scions grafted on both the ohxlbj segregating population and qc controls from the first to the fourth years of growth . the phenotypic variability of the raw data is illustrated in table  <dig>  a wide range of vigour was observed in the grafted scions as early as in the first year of growth. in total,  <dig> trees  of the ohxlbj population developed sylleptic shoots in year  <dig>  of which  <dig> trees  grew more than  <dig> sylleptic shoots.table  <dig> phenotypic variability for scion architecture and flowering

after proleptic shoots developed in the second year of growth, a large variability was observed in the total number of branches, with a range of zero to  <dig> branches per tree. after the third year, third-order branches and spurs grew off the second-order sylleptic and proleptic branches. this branching habit was repeated in the following growing cycle, resulting in a very complex tree structure which could be ranked into three vigour classes based on overall tree size, with  <dig> small,  <dig> moderate and  <dig> vigorous phenotypes .

flowering first occurred at the beginning of the third year of growth after grafting for  <dig> individuals  of the ohxlbj population. the following spring ,  <dig> trees flowered. in year  <dig>   <dig> of the trees  did not flower, of which only five  had never flowered before. flowering occurred mainly on spurs and terminal buds, with an average of  <dig>  flower clusters per tree in year  <dig> and  <dig>  in year  <dig> for the ohxlbj population. high numbers of axillary  flower clusters were found on the scions grafted onto the qc controls in year  <dig>  with an average of  <dig>  axillary buds and  <dig> spurs and terminal buds per tree. the trees grafted onto ohxlbj showed only minimal axillary flowering in year  <dig> and year  <dig>  with averages of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. in total,  <dig> rootstocks exhibited root suckering, while  <dig> did not. root suckering was detected for  <dig>  out of  <dig> of the trees classified as small,  <dig>  out of  <dig> moderate trees, and  <dig>  out of  <dig> vigorous trees. trees with root suckering had a significantly smaller average tca than those without .

correlation between traits
the raw phenotypic data were used to look at relationships between traits. figure  <dig> shows some selected correlation graphs, while the correlation matrix for all traits, with pearson correlations  and their significance values, can be found in additional file 1: table s <dig>  a significant positive correlation  was observed between branches_year <dig> and the tcatrunk_year <dig> and between the height_year <dig> and the tcatrunk_year <dig> . as expected, the highest correlation  was found between the tcatrunk_year <dig> and the tcaroot_year <dig>  showing the consistency in the measurements.fig.  <dig> scatterplots between different pear architectural and flower traits designed with rstudio. tca: trunk cross-sectional area. black circles represent ‘old home’ x ‘louise bonne de jersey’  seedlings and blue dots ‘quince c’ controls. the purple line shows a “friedman's super smoother” . the correlation coefficients  were calculated for the ohxlbj values only



no strong positive correlation between flowering and architectural traits was found. however, trees that flowered early  had significantly more sylleptic branches than those that did not  . the tca showed the strongest correlation with other traits and was therefore a representative measurement for tree vigour, becoming a stronger indicator for overall tree size with each annual growth cycle . the variation in vigour of the scions budded onto the qc rootstocks indicates the environmental influence within the orchard.fig.  <dig> interval plot of first-year  sylleptic branching comparing precocious and non precocious trees. symbols show the mean  and the error bars of the mean

analysis of the phenotypic variability within the orchard and among genotypes
positional effects within the orchard were accounted for by using three different linear mixed models: model 1: first-order autocorrelation for both row and plant position within the row; model 2: first-order autocorrelation for only the plant position; model 3: no autocorrelation for both row and plant position. for branches_year1- <dig>  height_year1 +  <dig>  inflorescence_year2 +  <dig>  spurs_year2 +  <dig>  tca_year3 +  <dig>  tcaroot_year3 +  <dig> and tcasec_year <dig>  the row and plant position auto-correlation did not improve the fit. for the height_year <dig>  lng_year2- <dig>  nodes_year <dig>  spurs_year <dig>  tca_year <dig> and the tcatert_year <dig>  the plant position improved the fit and model  <dig> was used for bivariate models for qtl detection. the clonal qc controls should arguably be fitted as fixed effects. this was tested with a few key variates and the breeding values obtained were very similar to those obtained from the model described. square root transformation was necessary to normalise the data for all traits recorded, except for branches_year <dig>  however, some variables  showed marked deviations from normality, even after transformation.

genetic map construction
high density genetic maps were constructed for both parents using  <dig> and  <dig> polymorphic pear and apple snp markers  <cit>  respectively . the oh map consists of  <dig> linkage groups  representing the  <dig> chromosomes of the pear genome. only  <dig> linkage groups were obtained for lbj, with lg <dig> being absent.table  <dig> number of pear and apple markers in ‘old home’  and ‘louise bonne de jersey’  genetic maps

the genetic maps of oh and lbj were aligned with parental maps of ‘moonglow’  and pear <dig>  <cit>  which contain ssr markers derived from apple .

qtl detection
qtls were detected using the oh and lbj parental genetic maps for the tree architecture and flowering traits across four years . significant qtls for the control of the number of branches were detected in three successive years on lg <dig> and lg <dig> of oh. a small-effect qtl controlling branches_year <dig> was located on lg <dig> of lbj and was also detected in year  <dig>  in the first year of growth after grafting, significant qtls were detected for the tcatrunk_year <dig> on lg <dig> and  <dig> of oh. the lg <dig> qtl was confirmed in years  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  whereas the lg <dig> qtl was not reproducible. a qtl influencing tcatrunk was detected on lg <dig> of oh in both years  <dig> and  <dig>  additional smaller-effect qtls controlling tcatrunk, inherited from lbj, were detected on lg <dig> and lg <dig>  qtls influencing lng were detected on oh lg <dig> in years 2– <dig> and these co-located with the tcatrunk qtl. smaller-effect qtls controlling the lng from lbj were located on lg <dig> and lg7; however, only the lg <dig> qtl could be replicated across two years. qtls controlling the tcasec_year <dig> and tcatert_year <dig> , height and the spurs per tree were detected on lg <dig> and lg <dig> of oh and lg <dig> and lg <dig> of lbj. a qtl controlling size_year <dig> was detected on lg <dig> and lg <dig> of oh, co-locating with the tcatrunk and height qtls. the architectural oh lg <dig> qtls explained between  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the variability for spurs_year <dig> and tcasec_year <dig>  respectively. the variance explained for the oh lg <dig> qtls ranked from  <dig>  % for tcatrunk_year <dig> to  <dig>  % for height_year <dig>  the highest variance explained by any lbj lg <dig> qtl was  <dig>  % for the qtl controlling the tcatert_year <dig>  and the lowest was  <dig>  % for the qtl influencing branches_year <dig>  a qtl controlling inflorescence phenotyped at the beginning of the third year after grafting was detected on lg <dig> of oh, co-locating with the tree architecture qtls. no flowering-related qtls were detected segregating from lbj. a qtl controlling suckers_year <dig> was detected on lg <dig> of oh.table  <dig> qtls detected for pear architectural and precocity traits for predicted and normalised data

dwarfing and precocity
architectural qtls were mainly detected on lg <dig> and lg <dig> of oh. qtls for the control of the total number of inflorescences co-located with the architectural qtls on lg <dig> of oh. the effects of the qtls indicate that smaller trees tended to have delayed flowering. analysis of the genotype of the marker with the highest lod score  of the lg <dig> qtl  demonstrated that individuals carrying the high vigour genotype  had a higher tendency for precocity, with 74 % being precocious, while 50 % of the individuals with the low vigour genotype  were precocious. however, only 14 % of the total population had the desired low vigour and precocious phenotype, with more individuals carrying the ab allelotype.table  <dig> segregation of dwarfing and precocity among the seedlings in the ohxlbj population using marker ss475878191

pear rootstock cultivars are underlined. hi01c <dig> is linked to dw <dig> in apple. the alleles are represented by the fragment size amplified and analysed using the abi <dig> instrument. the 116 bp allele linked to low vigour in ohxlbj is indicated in bold. accessions with a ohxlbj prefix are individuals from the ohxlbj segregating population and are presented with their vigour and precocity phenotype. pfr the new zealand institute for plant & food research limited


a postman et al.  <cit>  found that the ‘old home’ x ‘farmingdale’  was actually a cross between ‘old home’ and ‘bartlett’



this allele was also detected in  <dig> european pear cultivars , including pyrus rootstocks such as ‘pyriam’, ‘fox’ and some rootstocks of the ‘old home’ x ‘farmingdale’  series. the 116 bp fragment was more frequent in ohxlbj individuals, conferring low vigour to the scion. this allele was also detected in the dwarfing rootstock ‘pyrodwarf’, also derived from an ohxlbj population.

discussion
tree architecture and productivity are complex traits that are expressed only after several years of growth following grafting and are influenced by both genetics and environmental factors  <cit> . knowledge about genetic factors that confer rootstock-induced dwarfing of the scion in fruit trees is limited because of the difficulty in generating large segregating rootstock populations, as well as the requirement for robust and time-consuming phenotyping across multiple years, and the construction of dense genetic maps. our systematic attention to these factors has enabled us to identify qtls that control vigour and precocity in the grafted scion in pear rootstocks for the first time.

tca is a strong indicator of tree vigour
tca was found to be a strong indicator for overall tree size in ‘comice’ scions grafted to our seedling rootstocks, first becoming evident in year  <dig> and becoming stronger with each successive annual cycle, as previously reported for apple  <cit> . high correlations between the tca and other vegetative growth traits, such as the height of the tree and the number of branches, substantiate our finding.

qtls controlling precocity and vigour
qtls controlling both precocity and architectural traits were located on lg <dig> and lg <dig> of oh and lg <dig> for architectural traits segregating from lbj. these qtls are considered robust, as they were detected for successive years in the same position and often with the same marker having the highest lod score. the co-location of all qtls on lg <dig> and lg <dig>  respectively, of oh indicates that the overall dwarfing effect is controlled by at least two loci. however, the variance explained by each qtl is low  indicating that the traits under investigation may be controlled by more loci than identified in this study. furthermore, a strong environmental influence and a lack of replicates hampered the detection of major effect loci controlling precocity and architectural traits.

a small effect qtl for root suckering was detected on lg <dig> in the same genomic region as the architecture qtls. rootstocks of 69 % of the trees classified as dwarf produced suckers, indicating a strong correlation between dwarfing and suckering, and suggesting that the same physiological mechanisms might control both traits. we hypothesise that a reduced auxin transport from the scion to the roots, induced by pyrus rootstocks, may promote root suckering and reduce scion vigour. this hypothesis is consistent with the findings that polar auxin transport in the xylem parenchyma inhibits suckering  <cit> , and that a reduced auxin transport in the rootstock stem occurs in dwarfed apple trees  <cit> .

the qtl controlling tree architecture and flowering on pear lg <dig> is in a genomic region orthologous to that of dw <dig>  which is the major locus for dwarfing conferred on apple scions by the ‘m9’ rootstock  <cit> . these results are consistent with our hypothesis that orthologous loci in apple and pear control scion growth and precocity conferred by the rootstock. we found that the proximal marker flanking the dw <dig> locus in apple also segregates for dwarfing and precocity in pear, and that the 116 bp pear allele linked to low vigour in the rootstock mapping population is carried by the dwarfing pear rootstock ‘pyrodwarf’. our findings raise the possibility that the apple dwarfing locus dw <dig> and the oh lg <dig> qtl are derived from the same source, and therefore probably existed before the divergence of apple and pear. the conservation of synteny for qtls involved in tree architecture has enabled us to align the genomic regions of interest. this will facilitate the identification of candidate genes for dwarfing in both species and enable the testing of our hypothesis of a common origin for this locus, either before the pyrus-malus speciation or due to hybridization.

indeed, pyrus and malus are known to infrequently cross-hybridize  <cit>  and p. communis is sympatric with m. sylvestris, a related species that contributed genetically to the ancestry of modern m. x domestica , including the dwarfing rootstock ‘m9’. it is interesting to note that a second pear qtl corresponding to apple dw <dig> was not detected on lg <dig> in the present study. phenotypic analysis of scions grafted to segregating rootstock populations has demonstrated that the combination of dw <dig> and dw <dig> confers the greatest degree of rootstock-induced dwarfing in apple rootstocks  <cit> .

tree size and precocity
we found that precocious and non-precocious trees differed significantly in the number of sylleptic branches grown in the first year, with a lower sylleptic branch number correlating with a delay in flowering. although studies in pear indicate that the scion cultivar has a greater influence on sylleptic shoot formation than the rootstock  <cit> , watson et al.  <cit>  found that both the rootstock and the scion influence the number of first-year sylleptic branches. in this study we have confirmed the influence of the rootstock on early branch development in pear; however, we could not evaluate the effect of the scion. watson et al.  <cit>  also found that increased flowering did not result in early growth reduction in pear, and they suggested that the difference between the apple and pear rootstock dwarfing effects might lie in the length of the juvenile period.

the qtl conferring reduced sylleptic branching, tree size and tca in pear co-locates with the qtl on lg <dig> conferring precocity. however, the effects of the detected qtls are in trans, unlike the situation in apple, meaning that a smaller tree takes longer to flower. in terms of breeding, this means that it is difficult to breed for rootstocks conferring both reduced tree size and precocity to the scion cultivar. however, 14 % of the trees in our segregating rootstock population did exhibit low vigour and precocity in their grafted scions.

assuming the application of marker assisted selection  on the basis of the ss <dig> aa allelotype, only 11 % of the individuals would have the desired low vigour and precocious phenotype. however, selection for the ab allelotype would result in a slightly higher percentage  of individuals with both desired traits in the progeny. hence, selecting for the ss <dig> ab allele would increase the proportion of rootstocks in a breeding population that confer both precocity and a reduced vigour to the scion. however, the percentage of rootstocks conferring low vigour and precocity was generally low . it is noteworthy that in this respect, our findings for the pear rootstock qtls differ from the effects of the apple qtl on lg <dig> which confers both precocity and a reduced tree size. the dwarfing effect of ‘m9’ apple rootstocks is correlated with an increase in the proportion of floral buds relative to vegetative buds and sylleptic shoots that develop within the first year of growth  <cit> . the up-regulation of key flowering genes in ‘m9’ rootstocks may be responsible for this shift from vegetative to floral development. as a high proportion of axillary floral shoots leads to reduced vegetative growth in the next growth cycle, the tree becomes more dwarfed over time. a substantial difference between flowering in apple scions grafted onto ‘m9’ and the pear scions in this study was the position of the floral buds on the developing tree. in apple, flowering occurs in axillary and terminal buds, and, as the tree ages, is more common on 2-year-old spurs. in pear, flowering mostly occurs on two-year-old spurs and terminal buds. this biological difference has profound implications to the subsequent development of tree architecture. apple scions grafted onto ‘m9’ flower at the beginning of the second year of growth after grafting, while pear scions on pear rootstocks do not flower until the third year of growth and thus have a longer period of vegetative growth before flowering. in pear, an increase in branching in years  <dig> and  <dig> would generate the potential for more spurs for flowering in year  <dig>  and hence the relationship between early vegetative vigour and flowering would be opposite to that observed in apple. no qtl was detected for the percentage of axillary inflorescence in this study. it might be predicted that crossing a rootstock that increases the number of axillary buds on the scion cultivar with oh might result in a dwarfing pear rootstock, similar to ‘m9’, conferring both low vigour and precocity to the scion.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we detected the first pear rootstock qtls associated with control of architectural and flowering traits in scions. furthermore, we found that these orthologous loci control scion growth and precocity in apple and pear rootstocks. these findings will facilitate the identification of candidate genes for control of scion traits by rootstocks in both species. future research may focus on finding the common origin for the dwarfing locus in apple and pear. the application of our results in pear rootstock breeding may assist in developing a marker for mas selection for breeding a pear rootstock that confers both vigour control and precocity to the grafted scion cultivar.
