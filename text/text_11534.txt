BACKGROUND
linear polysaccharides composed of mannuronic and guluronic acid residues that may be o-acetylated, are denoted alginate. these polymers are synthesized by brown and some red algae and by bacterial species belonging to the genera azotobacter and pseudomonas. alginates manufactured from brown algae are currently used in diverse industrial and pharmaceutical applications. however, alginates produced by bacteria can more easily be tailored to obtain the compositions desired for the more high-value end of the alginate market  <cit> , and this has motivated our studies on alginate-producing bacteria.

production of a secreted polysaccharide imposes a drain on the cell’s carbon and energy sources, and thus the biosynthesis is usually tightly regulated under natural conditions. in batch cultures, alginate-producing p. fluorescens mutants display a reduced cell yield compared to the corresponding non-alginate producing strains  <cit> . bacterial alginate production is controlled by the alternative sigma factor algu and is usually turned off in pseudomonas spp. induction of alginate biosynthesis results in a proteolytic cascade that finally cleaves the algu anti-sigma factor muca, leading to transcription of the genes in the alg operon  <cit> .

in the first steps of bacterial alginate biosynthesis fructose 6-phosphate  is converted to gdp-mannuronic acid by the concerted action of alga, algc and algd. gdp-mannuronic acid is then polymerized to polymannuronic acid by alg <dig> and the copolymerase alg <dig>  together with algg, algx, algk and alge these form a protein complex that transports the alginate out of the cell as depicted in fig. 1a  <cit> . algg also epimerizes some m-residues to g, while algi, algj, algf and algx are needed to o-acetylate some of the m-residues. the alginate lyase algl removes alginate molecules that have been released to the periplasm  <cit> . twelve of the thirteen genes directly involved in alginate biosynthesis are found in the alg operon, while the last, algc, is found elsewhere on the chromosome. this gene organization is found in all characterized alginate-producing bacteria. in addition to fru6p and gtp, dimeric cyclic di-gmp  is needed for bacterial alginate biosynthesis  <cit> .fig.  <dig> the relationship between alginate biosynthesis and the cellular metabolism in p. fluorescens. a the proteins and metabolites needed for alginate biosynthesis. b a simplified model of the cell’s metabolism highlighting the processes identified in the present study as being important for full alginate biosynthesis levels. the genes discussed in the paper are highlighted in yellow. the entner-doudoroff pathway and the oxidative part of the pentose phosphate pathway are indicated by red arrows, and the non-oxidative part of the pentose phosphate pathway with purple arrows. green arrows indicate other pathways competing with accumulation of the three metabolites fru6p, gtp and c-di-gmp, while blue arrows indicate pathways that would increase the synthesis of one of these three metabolites. each arrow may represent several enzymatic steps. abbreviations: om: outer membrane, im: inner membrane, m: mannuronic acid residue, g: guluronic acid residue, ac: acetyl, tca: tricarboxylic acid cycle, pp: the non-oxidative part of the pentose phosphate pathway, gn6p: glucosamine 6-phosphate, pg: peptidoglycan, g6p: glucose 6-phosphate, 6pg: 6-phosphogluconate, pyr: pyruvate, ilv: isoleucine leucine valine, b5: pantothenate, trp: tryptophan, prpp: phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, r5p: ribose 5-phosphate, e4p: erythrose 4-phosphate




recently we showed that the alginate synthesis rate is not proportional to the number of alginate biosynthetic complexes, indicating that there must be some kind of metabolic control as well  <cit> . in a recent transposon screen, some genes affecting algu-regulation were identified in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . however, the aim of the present study was to identify genes and pathways that influence alginate biosynthesis indirectly by perturbing the cell’s metabolism. an alginate-producing p. fluorescens strain in which the alg operon and algc is under control of the inducible pm promoter was constructed and subjected to transposon mutagenesis. the pm promoter and its activator xyls originally controls expression of the genes of the meta-cleavage pathway of aromatic hydrocarbons on the pseudomonas putida plasmid pww <dig>  <cit> . we have earlier shown that the pm promoter and the weaker pm promoter derivative pm-g <dig> are useful for obtaining different levels of controlled gene expression in p. fluorescens  <cit> . about  <dig> insertion mutants were screened with respect to growth and alginate biosynthesis, and the inactivated genes in mutants displaying altered alginate yields were identified. the results supported our hypothesis that further levels of post-translational regulation exist, allowing the cell to prioritize basic cellular metabolism over alginate biosynthesis.

RESULTS
construction of a p. fluorescens strain in which the alginate biosynthesis genes are controlled by the inducible pm promoter
in order to avoid re-identification of the genes already known to directly regulate expression of the structural alginate biosynthetic genes, a derivative of p. fluorescens sbw <dig> designated strain ms <dig> was constructed . in this strain the naturally regulated algd promoter  was substituted with the wild-type pm promoter. xyls, encoding the activator protein needed for expression from the pm promoter, was inserted upstream of pm. then algc was inactivated by an in-frame deletion followed by a chromosomal insertion of a transposon containing a new algc copy expressed from a mutant version of pm   <cit> . this strain, designated ms <dig>  produces only a small amount of alginate in the absence of pm induction due to the low uninduced activity of pmg <dig> fig.  <dig> genotypes for selected genetic constructs used in this study. a strain ms <dig> in which the pm promoter and the gene encoding xyls is inserted between the promoter and start codon of algd. b strain ms <dig> in which a transposon expressing algc from pmg <dig> is inserted into pflu <dig> in an algc

alginate production has been reported to affect cell yield in p. fluorescens  <cit> , and it was also possible that m-toluic acid would have an effect on growth. this was tested by cultivating the non-alginate producing wild type strain sbw <dig> and strain ms <dig> in biolector® for three days in  <dig>  x pia supplemented with glycerol as carbon source. growth rate and cell yield was significantly lower for the induced strain ms <dig> relative to the non-alginate producing strain, while no effect was seen by cultivating sbw <dig> in the presence or absence of  <dig>  mm m-toluic acid .

the transposon carrying algc was found to disrupt pflu <dig>  which is the last gene in an operon encoding a putative abc transporter . in the presence of the pm/pmg <dig> inducer , the alginate production of strain ms <dig> was similar to that of strain ms <dig> .

construction of a transposon insertion library and screening with respect to alginate synthesis
the transposon-containing suicide vector pms <dig>  was used for mutagenesis of strain ms <dig>  nearly  <dig> insertion mutants were picked robotically from the original agar medium plates and cultivated in 96-deep-well microtiter plates containing  <dig> x liquid pia with glycerol and m-toluate. after three days, cell densities and alginate production were measured. the initial screen was followed by a rescreen of primary candidates and  <dig> mutants were found to produce less than 50%  or more than 110% alginate  when compared to the parent strain. the transposon insertion sites in all these mutants were determined by dna sequencing, leading to identification of  <dig> different genes belonging to most of the main cellular functions . of these genes only ten were known alginate biosynthesis structural genes, while one was xyls, the positive regulator of pm expression. these results show that about 92% of the identified genes are not directly associated with alginate synthesis. the screen did not cover all relevant genes in the genome, since insertions in algg, algf and algi  were not found.

evaluation of the mutants to select candidates for further studies
sequenced mutants with altered alginate phenotypes were cultivated in triplicates in 96-deep-well microtiter plates in three different media;  <dig> xpia with glycerol and  <dig> xdef <dig> with fructose or glycerol as carbon sources , and  <dig>  mm m-toluate to induce alginate production. in the def <dig> media ammonium is the only nitrogen source, while pia contains peptone that may be used as both nitrogen and carbon source. furthermore, def <dig> contains more phosphate than pia. the alginate yield from the control strain  was significantly higher in the def <dig> media, about 3 g/l compared to about 1 g/l in pia, which resulted in better accuracy of the data in def <dig> for low alginate producers.

results for mutants displaying significantly altered alginate production levels in at least one of the three media, are shown in table  <dig>  significant changes were defined as less than 50% or more than 110% of the alginate production of the parent strain, and 36% of the retested gene-inactivation mutants did not meet this criterion. no mutant produced more alginate than the control strain in all three media. mutants with insertions in alginate biosynthetic genes and xyls did, as expected, not produce alginate and are not included in table  <dig>  when several mutants had the same gene inactivated and displayed similar phenotypes, results from only one of them are shown in table  <dig>  for mutants where genes involved in glycerol utilization, amino acid biosynthesis or phosphate uptake had been inactivated, one would expect that the observed effects on biomass and alginate yield should be media dependent. as shown in table  <dig> this was the case for most genes belonging to these categories.table  <dig> identified mutants and their growth yield and alginate production in the three mediaa

a: the strains were cultivated in microtiter plates for three days before cell and alginate yield were measured. the mutants shown are those that displayed significantly different alginate production levels in at least one of the three tested media. data are not shown for strains with transposon insertions in the genes encoded by the alginate operon or in algc. the table shows how many independent transposon insertions mutants that were identified for each gene, the gene identifier, the gene name, and which functional group the corresponding protein is assigned to. growth above 125% and alginate production above 110% are marked using bold types, growth and alginate production between  <dig> and 50% are marked using italics, and growth and alginate production below 10% are written in bold italics. three biological replicates were cultivated for each strain, and the results are given as percent  of the values obtained from the control strain ms <dig>  standard deviations for the three replicates are shown in the columns to the right 




it is probable that in many cases the phenotype observed in a transposon insertion mutant is caused directly by inactivation of the identified gene. however, polar effects  and unrelated, spontaneous mutations can certainly not be excluded. for those genes where several independent transposon insertion mutants were identified, it is more likely that the observed phenotype is caused by the observed transposon insertion. the same argument may be used when several genes encoding proteins in the same metabolic pathway have been identified. in addition,  <dig> of the identified genes were chosen to be complemented either by expressing the wild type gene on a transposon or by adding the lacking metabolite. the transposons were constructed and transferred to the mutant strains, and both the mutant strains and the complemented strains were cultivated in two new growth experiments . two of the  <dig> mutants could not be complemented and are not discussed further. these results show that the phenotypes of  <dig> out of  <dig>  tested mutants can be explained by the transposon insertions only.table  <dig> growth and alginate production of mutants using medium supplements or complementing transposonsa

alginate biosynthesis requires a functional biosynthetic complex, fru6p and a dimeric form of c-di-gmp . interestingly, the majority of those mutants that reproducibly produced less alginate were assigned to the groups involved in uptake and metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids and nucleotides . in addition four genes encoding proteins involved in protein modification were identified. fig. 1b summarizes how the pathways identified in the current study might influence alginate yield, and these genes and pathways are discussed in more detail below.

alginate production is influenced by signal transduction systems involved in carbon, nitrogen and phosphor metabolism
four different signal transduction systems, cbrab, ntrbc, ptsntr, and phobr, were identified in the screen by using the criteria of either complementation or identification of several independent mutants in specific genes or pathways. the cbrab two-component system has been described in several species of pseudomonas as sensors and regulators of genes involved in utilization of different carbon and nitrogen sources, and has been proposed as sensors for the c/n balance in the cell  <cit> . it has been shown that cbrb activates the expression of non-coding rnas that relieve the catabolite repression otherwise exerted by crc  <cit> . in p. putida, inactivation of cbrb also affected stress responses and biofilm development  <cit> . our results show that the identified cbrb mutant produces less alginate  than the otherwise isogenic control strain in all three media . the mutant could be complemented by introducing a transposon-encoded copy of cbrb . the effect of inactivating cbra was, however, less pronounced, and might be caused by a polar effect on cbrb . in p. putida, a cbrb mutant was shown to be unable to use some amino acids as carbon source, and to have an increased expression level of some of the genes encoding proteins involved in the entner-doudoroff pathway  <cit> . if the consequences of inactivating cbrb is similar in p. fluorescens, these two effects alone might explain the observed growth and alginate yields for the cbrb mutants, by reducing the net flow to fru6p . however, given the known pleiotropic nature of a cbrb mutation, this probably is not the full explanation.

ntrbc is known to be an important response regulator system for bacterial nitrogen sensing, and has been found to interact with the cbrab system  <cit> . glne is needed for the posttranscriptional activation of glutamine synthase, which is a part of the ntrc regulatory cascade  <cit> . it has been shown that inactivation of this gene lowered the pool of fru6p in corynebacterium glutamicum  <cit> . consistent with this the alginate yield was significantly lower in pia and in def <dig> with fructose for both glne mutants .

glutamine and α-ketoglutarate are used by the ntrc-cascade to sense the carbon and nitrogen status of the cell, and these metabolites were recently found to affect the phosphorylation rate of the nitrogen-related phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system  in e. coli  <cit> . ptsntr is also known to form a link between carbon and nitrogen metabolism in pseudomonads  <cit> . while fructose is probably imported and phosphorylated by a pts in p. fluorescens, glycerol is taken up through a transport and kinase system and is fed into the central metabolism as triose phosphates  <cit> . ptsp  is the first protein in the nitrogen-related phosphate relay, and the two ptsp mutants identified in the current study produced low amounts of alginate both in pia  and in def <dig> with fructose . an earlier study has shown that a ptsp mutant of p. putida produces less polyhydroxyalkanoate than the wild type, and it was suggested that such a mutant would behave as if there was a carbon limitation  <cit> . a similar argument could be used to explain the lower yield of alginate in our ptsp mutant. recently it was also shown that inactivation of ptsp in p. aeruginosa decreases the level of c-di-gmp  <cit> .

the response regulator phob and the histidine kinase phor control the pho-regulon, which covers a major pathway for bacterial adaptation to phosphate starvation. phob may also be activated by other kinases  <cit> . since phob and phor form an operon, new in-frame deletion mutants for each of these genes were constructed in the alginate-producing strain sbw25mucahe <dig> . this strain was chosen because our standard gene recombination vector could not be used in the tetracycline-resistant strain ms <dig>  the wild-type genes were cloned both individually and as an operon on transposons, and these transposons were used to complement the deletion mutants. the new phor mutant behaved similarly to the wild type strain, while the phob deletion resulted in lower cell yield and no alginate production when cultivated in def <dig> with reduced phosphate concentration  . both traits were restored by chromosomal insertion of a transposon encoding both phob and phor, while chromosomal insertion of a transposon encoding phob only partially regained alginate production and normal growth. lack of phob will lead to decreased phosphate uptake under phosphate-limiting conditions, and this may result in less trinucleotides  <cit> . furthermore, in pseudomonas aeruginosa the algq , has been shown to regulate the production of gtp through its positive regulatory effect on transcription of ndk, and ndk is required for alginate production  <cit> . algq is an anti-sigma- <dig> factor and has been shown to positively regulate alginate production  <cit> , possibly by increasing the amount of rnap available for the alternative sigma-factor algu. transcription of algq is positively regulated by phob  <cit> . in our strain, transcription of the alginate biosynthetic genes depends on the pm promoter, which in turn depends on the sigma factors rpoh and rpos for transcription  <cit> . thus, it is possible that algq may have a positive effect on expression from pm. if that is the case, this might also explain the lack of alginate production in the phob mutant when grown in a low phosphate medium.

inactivation of certain genes involved in cell wall metabolism and vitamin biosynthesis leads to decreased alginate yield
in the present screen, insertions in five of the nine genes known to be involved in peptidoglycan recycling in pseudomonas  <cit>  were identified as having a negative impact on alginate biosynthesis . the absence of mpl, which is involved in recycling of the peptide part of peptidoglycan, only slightly decreased the alginate production. however, absence of any of the other four identified enzymes, ampg, anmk, amgk or nagz, resulted in very low alginate production in the pia medium and reduced alginate yield in the def <dig> media . the sugar phosphates used for peptidoglycan synthesis either originates from peptidoglycan recycling or is synthesized from fru6p . since fru6p is also a precursor for alginate, depletion of this phosphorylated sugar would be expected to cause decreased alginate yield  <cit> . the nagz and anmk genes were cloned on transposons, and shown to complement the deficiency in alginate production in the corresponding insertion mutants .

three of the identified genes, acee <dig>  ilvd and ispa were linked to pyruvate metabolism . acee <dig> encodes a component of pyruvate dehydrogenase, which is an essential part of the central carbon metabolism. the viability of this mutant might be explained by the presence of other genes encoding acee-like proteins in p. fluorescens. however, the acee <dig> mutant grew more slowly than strain ms <dig>  and hardly produced any alginate. ilvd encodes a dihydroxy-acid dehydratase that participates in the biosynthesis of branched amino acids and in the biosynthesis of pantothenate  and coenzyme a. the ilvd mutant displayed a similar phenotype as the acee <dig> strain in all three media . the ispa mutant would be expected to have defects in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, which would affect the biosynthesis of ubiquinone and the cell membrane. this mutant produced very low amounts of alginate when grown in pia, while the phenotypes in the def <dig> media were more similar to the control strain . all three mutants were complemented when the corresponding wild type genes were expressed from transposons . disruption of a pathway may often result in an increased flow to the immediate precursor for the missing enzyme, since the cell will perceive a lack of the end product. in the ispa and ilvd mutants this would lead to consumption of pyruvate, which then would have to be replenished by increasing the flow through the entner-doudoroff pathway . pantothenate  and ubiquinone are necessary for the anabolism and energy production of the cell, and the medium-dependent defects in growth and alginate yield displayed by the mutants might be caused by a lower content of these vitamins in peptone  compared to yeast extract .

deficiencies in purine or tryptophan biosynthesis reduce alginate yield
eleven of the mutants identified in the screen turned out to have insertions in genes needed for purine biosynthesis . gtp is required for alginate biosynthesis as a precursor for both gdp-mannuronic acid and the signal molecule c-di-gmp . three of the identified purine biosynthesis mutants  were retested in deep-well plate cultivations and grew poorly in all media . the purh strain was complemented when wild-type purh was expressed from a transposon, while the pure mutant was not complemented by expressing pure. this might, however, result from a polar effect on the downstream purk gene. addition of adenine and thiamine to the media increased both growth and alginate yield for all three mutants , strongly suggesting that the observed phenotypes were caused by deficiencies in the purine synthesis pathway.

in eight of the sequenced mutants, the transposon had disrupted genes putatively involved in amino acid biosynthesis . three of these, trpdef, were genes involved in tryptophan synthesis. the mutants with insertions in trpd and trpf were investigated further and both could be complemented by inserting an intact corresponding gene on a transposon . furthermore, addition of tryptophan to the growth medium restored normal growth and alginate yield in both mutants .

both tryptophan and purine synthesis are linked to fru6p through the pentose phosphate pathway . defects in these biosynthetic pathways might affect alginate synthesis negatively by increasing the need for phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate , and thus increase the flow from fru6p to this intermediate. since gtp is necessary for alginate biosynthesis, the observed phenotypes might also be caused by an insufficient supply of purines. our results are corroborated by other studies demonstrating that de novo synthesis of purine is necessary for biofilm formation in p. fluorescens  <cit> , and that tryptophan is important for biofilm formation in salmonella enterica  <cit> .

disruption of several genes encoding proteins involved in protein folding and modification result in reduced alginate yield
prc is a protease known to affect alginate biosynthesis in some muca mutants of p. aeruginosa, and has been proposed to indirectly participate in alginate biosynthetic gene activation through muca cleavage induced by cell wall stress  <cit> . however, in our strain both algc and the alg operon are controlled by the pm promoter, not by the endogenous algu-muca-regulated promoters. still, four independent prc mutants were identified as displaying a reduced alginate yield . our results therefore show that in p. fluorescens a prc mutation negatively affects alginate biosynthesis even in a muca
+ strain. in addition the screen identified another peptidase belonging to the same family, sohb, which also negatively affected alginate yield when inactivated. this phenotype was complemented by a transposon expressing sohb . it is unknown which proteins, apart from muca, is the target of these two proteases in p. fluorescens.

two genes encoding proteins involved in protein folding were identified in the screen as producing less alginate than the control . pflu <dig> encodes a putative thiol:disulfide interchange protein and is located upstream of and partly overlapping dsbg, encoding another disulfide isomerase. three independent inactivations of pflu <dig> were identified. pflu <dig> encodes the disulfide isomerase dsbc and its phenotype was complemented by a transposon-encoded copy of the gene . a mutant of p. aeruginosa with transposon-inactivated dsbc was recently found to display a non-mucoid phenotype  <cit> , indicating that dsbc is needed for normal levels of alginate production in both species. the results suggest that full alginate production in these media depend on correct folding of some proteins. it remains unknown which proteins need these isomerases for correct folding.

CONCLUSIONS
in an earlier study, it was shown that inactivation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase increased alginate yield when glycerol was used as carbon source, and this indicated that the availability of fru6p may be one limiting factor to sustain high level alginate production  <cit> . furthermore, it has been shown that the number of alginate biosynthetic complexes are not influenced by the absence of precursors for alginate synthesis  <cit> , indicating that these complexes are not destabilized in the absence of polymer synthesis. the aim of screening a transposon insertion library, was to discover genes and metabolic pathways that indirectly influence alginate production in p. fluorescens. the main conclusion of our data is that alginate biosynthesis depends on sufficient levels of fru6p, gtp and c-di-gmp . inactivation of genes in several systems sensing the carbon/nitrogen ratio resulted in mutants that produce less alginate than the parent strain, and this further indicates that alginate production might be down-regulated as a response to a perceived carbon limitation. a majority of the analysed mutants displayed a significantly decreased alginate yield, while the cell yield was less affected, and in some cases even increased. this suggests that when p. fluorescens is facing certain nutrient limitations, less alginate is produced.
