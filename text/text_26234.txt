BACKGROUND
post-transcriptional modification plays an imperative role in trna secondary and tertiary structure formation  <cit> , stability  and ultimately affects trna functions  <cit> . sometimes it leads to the alternative folding of trnas  <cit> . it provides structural flexibility to trna and rigidifies certain regions to fine-tune the molecule for maximum performance  <cit> . it affects the gene expressions  <cit> , translation speed and accuracy  <cit> ; enhances the accuracy of codon binding  <cit>  and codon discrimination ability of trnas  <cit> . modification prevents frame shifting  <cit>  that is required for the maintenance of proper translational reading frame  <cit>  and enables translocation of the trna from a to p site  <cit> . some modified bases, particularly modifications of anticodon domain help in the amino-acylation reaction of aminoacyl-trna synthetases through recognition of cognate trnas . it is a principal reaction for the precise flow of genetic information into protein sequences  <cit> .

the position of modified base in trna sequence is also important because modified wobble position  <dig> expands trna ability to read more than one codons  <cit> . it contributes 30-40% of all codon recognition depending on the codon usage of an organism  <cit> . u <dig> is mostly modified  <cit>  and is responsible for the majority of wobble based codon recognitions  <cit> . the trna modifications are involve in various diseases such as type  <dig> diabetes , cancer  and mitochondrial disease  <cit> . modification also plays important role in human immunodeficiency virus selection of a specific human trna to prime reverse transcription  <cit> . a recent study showed that trna modifications play an important role in genome structure and codon usage  <cit> . yet, cellular and functional dynamics of trna modifications is unexplored and poorly understood due to the absence of large-scale analysis and quantification of modifications. the experimental determination of trna modification is also an expensive, tedious and labor-intensive process. therefore, there is a need to develop an algorithm for the prediction of trna modifications.

in this study, an attempt has been made to develop in-silico technique for identification of modified bases in trna sequence. we retrieved and analyzed modified trna from modomics database  <cit>  and observed that most of the modifications are uridine-derived. therefore, we focused our study on the prediction of uridine modifications  in trna. we used various features such as compositions, binary and structural information of trna for developing support vector machines  based models for identification of modified uridine in trna. it was observed that pseudouridine  and dihydrouridine  were more prevalent modifications in the trna sequences. therefore separate prediction models have been developed for these  prominent uridine modifications . it is known that modification varies between different kingdoms; therefore we also developed kingdom-specific prediction models. this sequence based prediction and classification of ums will help the scientific community to explore trna biology. in this era of next-generation sequencing , trnamod tool developed in this study will be useful for the genome-wide prediction of trna modifications.

RESULTS
in this study, two different version of modomics database update  <dig>  <cit>  and update  <dig>  <cit>  have been used. update  <dig> and  <dig> of modomics database were containing  <dig> and  <dig> trna  sequences respectively. in the analysis part, we used all the  <dig> trnas of the  <dig> update. we analyzed position-specific base conservation in standard 1– <dig>  representation using weblogo  <cit>  and observed that some positions were conserved whereas most of positions have variants . thus, determination of position-specific modification in the variable region is a major challenge.

analysis of all trna modifications
we observed that ~13% bases were modified. it means that on an average,  <dig> bases of each trna  were modified. the nucleotide-compositions of u, g, a, c and any/other in trna sequences were  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. the u-, g-, a- and c-derived modifications were  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all trna modifications respectively. base specific modification rate varies between the different kingdoms but still uridine-derived modifications are most abundant in all the kingdoms . the  <dig> % of all uridines were modified whereas only  <dig> % of guanines,  <dig> % of adenines and  <dig> % of cytosines were modified. we observed in the kingdom-wise two sample logos  of modified and unmodified patterns  that uridines were also most abundant in the neighboring positions of modified base whereas cytosines and guanines were preferred in the neighboring positions of unmodified bases . most of modifications were uridine-derived; therefore we selected only these modifications for further study.figure  <dig>

analysis of uridine modifications 
there are several modifying enzymes that play important role in the post-transcriptional modifications of trna. it is important to investigate the differences between modified  and unmodified uridines. therefore, we created kingdom-wise tsls and observed that significant differences were present between modified and unmodified uridines . the bases of central  position were modified/unmodified uridines. the modified uridines were flanked by guanine  and uridine  whereas unmodified uridines preferred cytosine  and guanine  as neighbors. most of modified uridines preferred guanine at 6th and adenine at 11-12th positions . although, there were  <dig> different type of uridine-modifications present but pseudouridine  was most  abundant ums . sequence-based conservation of pseudouridine modifications was analyzed and observed that there was very low conservation present . only some conservation of uridine at 5′ and cytosine at 3′end was present . it is well known because tyc  is always present in tsl but pseudouridine is also present at other sites. the dihydrouridine  was second most abundant  and only present in the dsl but as weblogos suggested that there was no sequence-based conservation present for this modification . on the basis of these analyses, we developed prediction models for the all uridine-modification, pseudouridine and dihydrouridine separately.figure  <dig>

in this study, we used a three-step strategy to develop an efficient method for the prediction and classification of uridine modifications. in first step, we developed a common prediction method using trna- <dig> dataset of modomics database update  <dig>  <cit> . in the second step, we used newly added trna sequences  of modomics database update  <dig>  <cit>  for the kingdom-wise prediction performance evaluation of previously developed  common model. in the last step, we used trna- <dig> and trna- <dig> datasets  of modomics database update  <dig> for the kingdom-wise prediction model development.

identification of uridine modifications
in past, various machine learning based prediction methods have been developed for biological problems and svm is one of the most powerful and highly used algorithms. first, we generated sliding window of different lengths and created positive and negative patterns. if central nucleotide of window is modified uridine, the whole pattern was used as positive otherwise windows with unmodified uridines at central positions were used as negative patterns . we optimized window sizes by prediction performances and applied following approaches and developed various svm-based prediction models. in first step, all models were developed on a non-redundant dataset called ‘trna-136’ , which contain  <dig> trna sequences, where no two sequences have more than 50% sequence similarity.

compositions-based approaches
we developed various svm based modules for predicting modified uridine in trna using mono-, di- and tri-nucleotide composition  and optimized window size for achieving best performance in terms of area under curve . we achieved maximum auc  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for mono-, di- and tri-nucleotide composition respectively.

binary approach
the compositions-based approaches give information of only nucleotide frequencies; it has no information about sequential arrangement of these nucleotides. therefore, we applied binary approach, which is widely used and is a successful strategy for the nucleotide  level predictions  <cit> . first, we generated binary profiles of patterns  of length  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides. these bpps were used to develop svm based methods for predicting modified uridine in trna sequences. we computed performance of window length  <dig> to  <dig> and achieved maximum mcc  <dig>  with accuracy  <dig> % and auc  <dig>  at 17-window length .

structure-based approaches
all nucleotide sequences of trnas fold into well-defined cloverleaf like structures. there are loop-specific ums presents in d-stem loop , t-stem loop , anticodon-stem loop  and variable loop . therefore, this structural information can also be useful for the prediction of ums. we used three different software packages namely rnafold  <cit> , ipknot  <cit>  and trnascan-se  <cit>  for predicting structure of trna. the binary representation of predicted trna structure was used for developing svm based models . the performance of svm models were based on the binary representation of structures trna, predicted using rnafold, ipknot and trnascan-se shown in additional file 1: figures s <dig>  s <dig> and s <dig> respectively. at window length  <dig>  we achieved mcc  <dig>  with auc  <dig>  for models based on predicted structures using trnascan-se. one possible reason of better performance of trnascan-se approach is that it was developed specifically for trna and it predicted dsl, asl, vl and tsl boundaries correctly in comparison to rnafold and ipknot.

hybrid approach
as shown in above sections, svm models based on bpp  and on trnascan-se  predicted structures performed better than other models. in order to improve performance of our approach, we developed a model using windows-based five-fold cross validation that combines both types of information . this hybrid model performs better than existing models and achieved maximum  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % accuracy, mcc  <dig>  and auc of  <dig>  . we also used sequence-based five-fold cross validation of trna- <dig> dataset, where we kept all the windows of any single trna into a same sub-set during five-fold cross validation and achieved almost equal performance  to the window-based five-fold cross validation.figure  <dig>

to check whether over-representation of pseudouridine , dihydrouridine  and 5-methyl-uridine  caused any svm paramer over-fitting or not, we have used almost equal representation of different modifications. we randomly selected  <dig> y,  <dig> d, 30 t and  <dig> all other uridine modifications from the trna- <dig> dataset for model development. on this randomized dataset, we have achieved  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % accuracy, mcc  <dig>  and auc of  <dig>  on the same previosuly optimized parameter . it means there is no svm parameter overfitiing during model development .table  <dig>

classification of different uridine modifications
in the trna- <dig> dataset, ~72% of modified uridines belonged to either pseudouridine or dihydrouridine. therefore, we developed separate prediction models for these two major classes of ums.

prediction of pseudouridine  modification
we used patterns of pseudouridine as positives and all other ums as negatives. the maximum performance mcc  <dig>  and  <dig>  was achieved using svm models based on bpp and trnascan-se based approach respectively. we achieved best threshold-independent performance auc  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  using svm models based on bpp, trnascan-se predicted structures and hybrid approach respectively .

prediction of dihydrouridine  modification
the patterns of dihydrouridines were used as positive and other patterns of ums were used as negatives. the bpp approach achieved  <dig>  mcc and  <dig>  auc whereas trnascan-se based approach achieved  <dig>  mcc and  <dig>  auc. the hybrid approach predicted all dihydrouridines correctly  with  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % accuracy,  <dig>  mcc and  <dig>  auc values .

evaluation of developed models on the kingdom-wise independent datasets
in the second step, we wanted to see the performance of a common prediction model  on the kingdom-wise independent datasets. we used newly added trna sequences  of modomics databaset  <cit>  update  <dig>  for the performance evaluation of previously developed model. we achieved  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of auc for the prediction of modified uridines of all, archaea, bacteria, eukaryote-all, eukaryote-cyto, eukaryote-mito, eukaryote-plastid and viruses respectively . the model was not good to predict ums in the mitochondrial trnas because structure of  <dig> out of total  <dig> mitochondrial trnas were not predicted. therefore, we also applied previously developed bpp approach based model , where structural information was not required and achieved  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of auc for the prediction of modified uridines of all, archaea, bacteria, eukaryote-all, eukaryote-cyto, eukaryote-mito, eukaryote-plastid and viruses respectively . here also prediction performance was low for mitochondrial trnas. in the most of cases performances were decreased when we applied bpp instead of hybrid approach. it means structural information provided important information for the both, common  and kingdom-wise predictions.figure  <dig>

hybrid approach based models achieved  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of mcc for the pseudouridine prediction of all, archaea, bacteria, eukaryote-all, eukaryote-cyto, eukaryote-mito, eukaryote-plastid and viruses respectively. in the dihydrouridine prediction, hybrid model achieved  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of mcc for the modified  uridines of all, bacteria, eukaryote-all, eukaryote-cyto, eukaryote-mito, eukaryote-plastid and viruses respectively.

kingdom-wise prediction model development
in the third and last step, we used new kingdom-wise datasets from modomics database  <cit>  update  <dig>  it was shown in the previous approaches and evaluated by independent datasets that hybrid approach performed better if the structure predicted by trnascan-se otherwise bpp approach can also be use as an alternative. therefore, we have developed kingdom-specific prediction models using trna- <dig> and trna- <dig> datasets . the trna- <dig> is a 50% non-redundant and containing  <dig> archaeal,  <dig> bacterial,  <dig> eukaryotic  and  <dig> viral trnas. first we developed a bpp approach based common prediction model for modified uridine prediction and achieved  <dig>  of auc. when we analyzed the kingdom-wise performance in this common prediction than we found  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of auc for the archaea, bacteria, eukaryote-all, eukaryote-cyto, eukaryote-mito, eukaryote-plastid and viruses respectively . in the kingdom-wise individual  model development, we achieved  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of auc for the archaea, bacteria, eukaryote-all, eukaryote-cyto, eukaryote-mito, eukaryote-plastid and viruses respectively . these kingdom-wise individual models were also developed for the pseudouridine and dihydrouridine. in the pseudouridine prediction, we achieved  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of auc for the all, archaea, bacteria, eukaryote-all, eukaryote-cyto, eukaryote-mito, eukaryote-plastid and viruses respectively . we also achieved  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of auc for the dihydrouridine prediction of all, bacteria, eukaryote-all, eukaryote-cyto, eukaryote-mito, eukaryote-plastid and viruses respectively .figure  <dig>

in the hybrid approach, we used trna- <dig>  dataset instead of trna- <dig>  because trnascan-se software was not predicted structures of  <dig> trna sequences. the trna- <dig> dataset containing  <dig> archaeal,  <dig> bacterial,  <dig> eukaryotic  and  <dig> viral trnas. a common prediction model for modified uridine prediction achieved  <dig>  of auc in comparison to  <dig>  auc of bpp approach. in this performance of  <dig>  auc, kingdom-wise prediction performances were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of auc for the archaea, bacteria, eukaryote-all, eukaryote-cyto, eukaryote-mito, eukaryote-plastid and viruses respectively . in the kingdom-wise individual model development, we achieved  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of auc for the archaea, bacteria, eukaryote-all, eukaryote-cyto, eukaryote-mito, eukaryote-plastid and viruses respectively . these kingdom-wise individual models were also developed for the pseudouridine and dihydrouridine. the pseudouridine prediction performances were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of auc for the all, archaea, bacteria, eukaryote-all, eukaryote-cyto, eukaryote-mito, eukaryote-plastid and viruses respectively . this hybrid approach achieved  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of auc for the dihydrouridine prediction of all, bacteria, eukaryote-all, eukaryote-cyto, eukaryote-mito, eukaryote-plastid and viruses respectively . the dihydrouridine modifications were absent in the archaeal trna sequences. these results showed that hybrid approach performed better in comparison to bpp approach, whether kingdom-wise performances in the common method or individually developed methods. hybrid approach also performed better than bpp for the prediction of pseudouridine and dihydrouridine.figure  <dig>

although, our main focused was to predict ums in trna sequences and further classify them into pseudouridine and dihydrouridine modifications but we also tried to develop method for the third  most abundant um- 5-methyl-uridine.

prediction of 5-methyl-uridine  modification
the trna- <dig> dataset contains  <dig> % ums as 5-methyl-uridines. we analyzed kingdom-wise patterns and found that this modification is present only at a well-known conserved site gtyc  of the t-stem loop . therefore, it is easy to predict this modification, if boundaries of loops  are correctly predicted in the trna. the patterns of 5-methyl-uridine were used as positives and other ums were used as negatives for developing svm-based models. first we have used trna- <dig> and developed common model for the prediction of 5-methyl-uridines. in the threshold-dependent performances, bpp approach achieved  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc whereas trnascan-se achieved  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc. hybrid approach increased the performance and achieved  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc. the threshold-independent performance of bpp, trnascan-se and hybrid approaches achieved  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  auc values . on the independent datasets , hybrid approach based model achieved  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of mcc for the 5-methyl-uridine prediction of all, bacteria, eukaryote-all, eukaryote-cyto, eukaryote-mito, eukaryote-plastid and viruses respectively. finally, we applied bpp  and hybrid  approaches and achieved  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of auc for bpp  and  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of auc for hybrid approach  for the all, bacteria, eukaryote-all, eukaryote-cyto, eukaryote-mito, eukaryote-plastid and viruses respectively. the 5-methyl-uridine modification was absent in the archaeal trna sequences.

prediction of other uridine modifications
to see whether svm based machine learning can discriminate these three  modifications from other ums  or not, we applied same above-mentioned strategy. we used trna- <dig> dataset and patterns of y, d and t as negatives and patterns of other ums as positives. the bpp approach performed  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc. the structural information of trnascan-se based approach achieved  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc. the hybrid approach increased performance significantly and achieved  <dig> % sensitivity,  <dig> % specificity,  <dig> % accuracy and  <dig>  mcc. the threshold-independent performance of bpp, trnascan-se and hybrid approaches achieved  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  auc values .

on the independent datasets, hybrid approach based model achieved  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of mcc for the other modified  uridines of all, archaea, bacteria, eukaryote-all, eukaryote-cyto, eukaryote-mito, eukaryote-plastid and viruses respectively. the bpp  and hybrid  approaches were achieved  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of auc for bpp  and  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of auc for hybrid approach  for the all, archaea, bacteria, eukaryote-all, eukaryote-cyto, eukaryote-mito, eukaryote-plastid and viruses respectively. the prediction performances were low in comparison to y, d and t because here we used total  <dig> different types of modifications together as positives. in order to implement the prediction model in the form of web-server, it was necessary to develop a separate prediction model for other ums .

in conclusion, svm-based prediction modules performed better with hybrid approach of bpp and trnascan-se based structural information. the details of all results given in an excel file , contain results of all approaches, window sizes at all  thresholds and roc graphs.

discussion
in present study, we retrieved information of  <dig> and  <dig> modified trnas from modomics database  <cit> . initially, we analyzed all  <dig> trna modifications and observed that majority  of modifications were uridine-derived  and  <dig> % uridines of all uridines were modified. therefore, we selected only ums for further study. the kingdom-wise differences between flanking nucleotides of modified and unmodified uridines were observed . it may be due to the pattern-wise preference of modifying enzymes. in past, sliding window-based approach was widely used for nucleotide/residue level predictions  <cit> . it requires complete optimization of all window sizes for every prediction. we created different lengths  of sliding window patterns and various approaches of compositions; bpp and structural information were applied. first we used trna- <dig> dataset for the common prediction model and evaluated using 5-fold cross validation technique. in compositions based input features of mnc, dnc and tnc achieved auc of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the bpp increased the prediction performance to auc of  <dig>  auc because it provided information of nucleotides with their positions whereas compositions based approaches have only frequencies or one/two neighboring nucleotide information. all trna fold into well defined structures with some regions and loops more prone to modification thereby making the structural information useful for prediction. consequently, secondary structures provided by trnascan-se software achieved auc of  <dig> . when the structural information of trnascan-se software predicted boundaries of different loops was combined with positional information of nucleotides in the form of bpp; performance increased significantly and achieved auc of  <dig>  . we have also analyed the effect of window size on the prediciton performance and found that performance continously increased in 3– <dig> window size and saturated between the 17– <dig> window sizes .figure  <dig> 
prediction performance  of bpp and trnascan-se based approaches using different window sizes.




in the second step, we evaluated previously developed  models on the independent datasets and analyzed the kingdom wise performances. hybrid approach performed well for all, archaea, bacteria, eukaryote-all, eukaryote-cyto, eukaryote-plastid and viruses but not performed for eukaryote-mito . it may be because trna- <dig> contained only  <dig> mitochondrial trnas of saccharomyces cerevisiae and developed model was not good enough to predict ums in the mitochondrial trnas from other eukaryotes. although, mitochondrial trnas have evolutionary connection with bacterial trnas but our results showed that prokaryotic datasets based model cannot predict the uridine modifications in the mitochondrial trnas.

in the last step, we used bpp  and hybrid  approach for the final kingdom-specific prediction models and evaluated using five-fold cross validation technique. the hybrid approach performed better than simple bpp approach in all kingdoms. it means structural information provided important information, when it integrated with bpp . hybrid approach achieved  <dig>  auc for all trnas but when applied separately for archaea and eukaryotes, it increased to the auc of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. we found that hybrid approach of bpp and trnascan-se was efficient not only to predict ums but also to classify them into pseudouridine and dihydrouridine . the bpp approach can also be useful as an alternative, if structure of trna is not available . we also developed models for the third most abundant  5-methyl-uridines ums.

a recent study of novoa et al.  <cit>  showed that additional information of two modifications  improved correlation between codon usage and trna gene frequencies in all kingdoms significantly. modifications in asls are very important given the fact that modified u <dig> acts as proton donor/acceptor, coordinates metal ions and has great diverse chemistry  <cit>  ultimately affecting codon-anticodon recognition. the asls, dsls, tsls and vls of different trnas vary in sequence and the type of modification. modification of seven-nucleotide asls  is more important because global conformation of asls decides entry of anticodon domain into the ribosomal a-site  <cit>  and affects translation speed  <cit> . data availability is the main criterion for the development of any prediction model and the number of uridine modifications  is very high in comparison to guanine , adenine  and cytosine  modifications. therefore, we developed prediction models for ums only. many rna modifications are not essential for cell survival. probably these modifications are less important or not fully explored yet considering the fact that many dna and protein modifications are also not essential. precise roles of most of trna modifications are poorly understood and their industrial applications are still unexplored. pseudouridine provides rigidity whereas dihydrouridine is the only non-aromatic nucleoside and provides flexibility to the trna structure. in this era of synthetic biology, better understanding of trna modifications will help in the better trna designing, incorporation of novel amino acids and production of new proteins. in particular, biochemists have great opportunity to play with the chemistry of wobble base and expand amino acid boundaries.

CONCLUSIONS
to conclude, the present study is a systematic attempt to predict and classify ums in trna sequences. we developed separate and kingdom-wise predictors for the prediction of ums and thereafter classify them into pseudouridines, dihydrouridines and 5-methyl-uridine and other ums. we found that hybrid approach of binary and structural information is most suitable for the svm based prediction of ums. these prediction modules have been implemented in a ‘trnamod’ web-server. this server can predict and classify ums from trna sequences or whole genome of any organism.
