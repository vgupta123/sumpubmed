BACKGROUND
helminth infections are estimated to infect about  <dig> billion individuals worldwide . although rarely fatal, these parasites cause high rates of morbidity by establishing chronic infections. in particular, the highest parasite burdens are observed in pre-school and school-aged children, often resulting in anemia, undernourishment and growth stunting . during pregnancy helminth infection is a risk factor for preterm delivery, reduced birth weight and maternal mortality . moreover, by chronically infecting their host, parasitic worms increase the susceptibility to other pathogens such as viruses, bacteria and protozoa  <cit> . previous works have indicated that the intensity of helminth infection is a heritable trait, although measures of heritability vary among studies and depend on the parasite beanalyzed  <cit> .

these observations suggest that helminth infections have represented a very strong selective pressure for humans, a selective pressure that is very likely to also be remarkably constant over time. indeed, most vertebrates have been hosting a wide range of parasitic worms for million years and humans have had their share before emerging as a species . we have previously addressed the role of helminths as selective agents in human evolution analyzing a large set of human genes encoding interleukins and their receptors; we demonstrated that the pressure imposed by parasitic worms on these genes has been stronger than the one due to viral and microbial agents  <cit> . the reasons for this observation likely lie in the long-term relationship between humans and helminths, in the relatively slow evolutionary rates of these parasites and in their geographic distribution being considerably stable. here we aimed at exploiting the selection signatures left by these pathogens on human genes to identify, at the genome-wide level, candidate genes and variants that may have been subjected to helminth-driven selective pressure.

RESULTS
helminth diversity and prevalence correlate across geographic locations
in order to search for candidate variants subjected to helminth-driven selection, an estimate of the selective pressure exerted by these pathogens needs to be defined. it has been previously suggested  <cit>  that the selective pressure exerted by infectious diseases in different geographic areas can be estimated by counting the number of different pathogen species/genera that are transmitted in these regions. in particular, in the case of helminthiases, we consider parasite diversity to be a better estimate of helminth-driven selective pressure than prevalence for different reasons. first of all, comprehensive data on prevalence are impossible to retrieve for many parasite species/genera or countries and even when available, prevalence data may vary considerably within the same country depending on the surveyed regions and the population surveyed . moreover, the prevalence of specific helminthiases might have changed greatly over recent years as a result of eradication campaigns, and historical prevalence data are rarely available. also, it should be considered that prevalence data are difficult to combine since in endemic regions polyparasitism is common  <cit> ; indeed, in these regions subjects infected with multiple helminths tend to harbor the most intense infections, possibly due to an additive and/or multiplicative impact on nutrition and organ pathology .

these same observations also apply to other possible measures such as parasite burden or infection pathogenicity, which are very difficult to quantify and that may have varied considerably along human evolutionary history. conversely, the diversity of helminth species transmitted in different geographic locations has been shown to depend upon climatic variables  <cit>  which, in turn, may be considered as relatively stable over time, suggesting that diversity may better describe long-term evolutionary pressures. thus, we calculated helminth diversity from the global infectious disease and epidemiology network database ; as described in the method section, all entries for single helminthiases were manually inspected and all species/genera transmitted in a given location were counted as present irrespective of their prevalence. the number of different helminth species/genera per country is reported in additional file  <dig> .

we next wished to verify whether the prevalence of the most common helminth infections  correlates with helminth diversity across the  <dig> populations genotyped in the hgdp-ceph panel . again, we retrieved prevalence and diversity data from gideon by manually inspecting single and retrieving all prevalence surveys. the prevalence of single helminthiases per country was obtained by averaging all surveys; data obtained on hiv-seropositive individuals were not included in the analyses because of the known modulation of hiv on the susceptibility on helminth-based infections  <cit> . finally, countries with no survey data were not included in the analysis for the specific helminth. parasites were then grouped into five major classes . as shown in table  <dig>  the prevalence of all parasite groups correlated with helminth diversity.

a dracunculus medinenis was not included because prevalence data were only available in few countries;

b prevalence data were available for  <dig> populations only.

snps associated with helminth diversity are over-represented in immune response genes
previous analysis have indicated that several genes coding for interleukins and interleukin receptors are subjected to helminth-driven selective pressure  <cit> . interleukins are central mediators of immunity and inflammation and, in general, we might expect genes with a role in immune response to be preferential targets of helminth-driven selective pressure. specifically, we expect variants within these genes to be more frequently associated with helminth diversity than observed for randomly sampled loci. we verified this prediction by analyzing the immport list which contains  <dig>  genes involved in immune response and covered in the hgdp-ceph panel, this latter containing data for more than  <dig>  single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped in almost  <dig> individuals sampled throughout the world   <cit> .

we calculated kendall's τ rank correlation coefficient between allele frequencies of snps in immport genes and helminth diversity. a snp was defined as being significantly associated with helminth-diversity if it displayed a significant correlation  and a τ value higher than the 95th percentile in the distribution of correlation coefficients calculated over all snps having minor allele frequency  similar  to that of the snp being analyzed. this latter requirement stems from the need to account for the influence of non-selective events, as a few hgdp-ceph population result from recent or ancient admixture  <cit>  and population history, migratory events and genetic drift have affected human genetic variability  <cit> . among  <dig>  immport genes,  <dig> contained at least one snp significantly associated with helminth diversity . the likelihood to obtain an equal or higher number of genes carrying significantly associated snps was assessed by a re-sampling approach. specifically, we divided all genes with at least one snp typed in the hgdp-ceph panel in  <dig> intervals based on the number of typed snps;  <dig>  re-samplings were then performed by selecting for each immport gene, a randomly selected gene with a similar number of snps  . the number of snps in immport genes did not differ significantly from the average number in the re-samplings  and the empirical probability of obtaining  <dig> genes with at least one significant snp resulted equal to  <dig> , indicating that immune response genes more frequently display variants correlating with helminth diversity compared to randomly chosen loci.

when the same analysis was performed using the prevalence of soil-transmitted nematodes, filarial nematodes, schistosomes and food-borne trematodes no significant enrichment for immport genes was observed .

in agreement with previous suggestions  <cit> , these data indicate that helminth diversity may be a reliable estimator helminth-driven selective pressure.

genome-wide search for variants subjected to helminth-driven selective pressure
given these results, we wished to identify snps significantly associated with helminth diversity on a genome-wide base. we therefore calculated kendall's rank correlations between allele frequency and helminth diversity for all snps  typed in the hgdp-ceph panel. we next searched for instances which withstood bonferroni correction with α =  <dig>   and displayed a τ percentile rank higher than the 95th among maf-matched snps. a total of  <dig>  snps mapping to  <dig> distinct genes satisfied both requirements . we next verified whether climatic variables could be responsible for the correlations detected between these snps and helminth diversity. hence, for all countries where hgdp-ceph populations are located we obtained the following parameters: average annual minimum and maximum temperature, short wave radiation flux and precipitation rate . none of these snps withstood bonferroni corrections in these analyses.

previous works have reported an enrichment of selection signatures within or in close proximity to human genes  <cit> . in line with these data we verified that helminth-associated snps are more frequently located within gene regions compared to a control set of maf-matched variants .

a full list of the  <dig>  snps that showed a significant correlation with helminth diversity is available as additional file  <dig> . table  <dig> shows the  <dig> strongest correlations together with a short comment on the possible role of candidate genes in immune response or helminth resistance.

among the  <dig> genes subjected to helminth-driven selective pressure, we identified ectodysplasin a  and its receptor . edar has been subjected to strong positive selection in populations of asian descent  <cit>  and is responsible for hair thickness in these populations  <cit> . one coding variant  in edar is thought to be the selection target but it has not been genotyped in the hgdp-ceph panel. we therefore wished to verify whether the variants we found to correlate with helminth diversity are located on the same haplotype as the selected 370ala allele. we used the sweep software  <cit>  to analyze the haplotype structure in the genomic region encompassing edar; we selected a core containing the 370ala/val variant and used hapmap data from asian individuals . the results indicated that most chromosomes carrying the putatively selected 370ala variant also harbor four alleles we found to be significantly correlated with helminth diversity .

functional characterization of genes subjected to helminth-driven selective pressure
we investigated the role and functional relationship among helminth diversity-associated genes using the ingenuity pathway analysis and the panther classification system  <cit> . for these analyses, a snp was ascribed to a given gene if it was located within the transcribed region or in the  <dig> kb upstream of the transcription start site.

unsupervised ipa analysis retrieved five high-scoring networks   and two additional networks with lower scores . the two highest scoring networks were merged, as well as networks  <dig> and  <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes in merged networks  <dig> and  <dig> correlated with helminth diversity, respectively, corresponding to almost 60% of network nodes.

we next investigated the over-representation of panther classification categories among genes significantly associated with helminth diversity. table  <dig> shows the  <dig> significantly over-represented panther pathways with the contributing genes, as well as the most significantly over-represented molecular functions and biological processes. notably, genes involved in cytokine-mediated inflammation and integrin signaling accounted for two significantly over-represented pathways. while the multiple functions of integrins and cytokines on the immune system are established, the role of glutamate and α adrenergic receptor signaling in immune related processes are less understood. recent evidence has indicated that ionotropic glutamate receptors are expressed by t lymphocytes  and glutamate can exert different actions on these cells including triggering adhesion, proliferation and chemotaxis . similarly, α adrenergic receptors are expressed by different immunocompetent cells ; in particular, expression of adra1a is induced in human monocytes by inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . finally, it is interesting to notice that components of the treleasing hormone  receptor signaling pathway are also over-represented among genes subjected to helminth driven selective pressure. tacts on specific receptors within the pituitary gland to stimulate the release of thyroid stimulating hormone and prolactin. the immunomodulatory role of thyroid hormones on immune functions are clearlyestablished . moreover, experiments in mice have indicated that thyroxine plays a role in the establishment of schistosoma mansoniinfection  <cit>  and animals treated with the hormone display increased parasite numbers and development of giant worms  <cit> . notably, among variants correlating with helminth diversity at the genome-wide level, we also found one snp relatively close to the gene encoding prolactin  and one variant within prlr  . prl was shown to be an immunomodulator and acts as a cytokine on many different immune cells; indeed, prlr is expressed by b, t and nk cells, as well as macrophages  and prl expression in t cells is regulated by il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il-1β. these data therefore suggest a role for both thyroid hormones and prolactin in the resistance to parasitic worms.

helminth-driven selection and susceptibility to allergy and asthma
we next wished to analyze the relationship between variants/genes associated with helminth diversity and the genetic susceptibility to asthma and allergy. we searched among published genome-wide association studies  for snps that have been associated with allergy, asthma or related traits . only  <dig> snps were retrieved,  <dig> of them genotyped in the hgdp-ceph panel. one of these snps  displayed a significant correlation  with helminth diversity  and the allele associated with high eosinophil counts  <cit>  positively correlated with the diversity of parasitic worms. in order to gain further insight into this issue, we focused on genes rather than variants, in line with the view that the gene rather than the allele should be regarded as the replication unit. given the low consistency that often plagues association studies, only robust allergy/asthma susceptibility genes were considered . as shown in table  <dig>  we observed that  <dig> allergy/atopy genes displayed at least one snp  significantly associated, at the genome-wide level, with helminth diversity. among these genes, one snp in il <dig> that has been associated with asthma  has also been genotyped in the hgdp-ceph panel; again, the allele that positively correlates with helminth diversity  is associated with asthma  <cit> .

it is worth noting that we found several snps located upstream the transcription start site of clta <dig> and subjected to helminth driven selective pressure. clta <dig> is located on the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  telomeric to cd <dig>  this raises the possibility that the observed allele associations at these two genes  derive from linkage to a single selected allele. yet, analysis of linkage disequilibrium   indicates that ld is not extensive across the genomic region , suggesting that cd <dig> and the promoter region of ctla <dig> are independent selection targets.

discussion
here we propose that candidate susceptibility genes for parasitic worm infections can be identified by searching for snps that display a strong correlation with the diversity of helminth species/genera transmitted in different geographic areas. our approach relies on the assumption that helminth-driven selective pressure has affected the spatial distribution of these variants and it may suffer from a few limits and caveats. first, we used the diversity of parasitic worms as a measure of helminth-driven selective pressure for the reasons reported above. yet, helminth diversity may be affected by report biases  and it weights equally all helminth species irrespective of their prevalence and disease burden. as an example, rare helminth species that are reported in gideon and included in our diversity measure may have exerted a very limited selective force . in order to evaluate the impact of rare species, we recalculated helminth diversity by taking into account only parasites that are common in at least one country . this diversity measure strongly correlated  with parasite diversity calculated over all species, suggesting that the inclusion of rare helminths should not largely affect our results. another possible confounding factor is accounted for by the co-variation of helminth diversity with other environmental variables . we verified that variants associated with helminth diversity are significantly enriched within immune response genes and that the snps we identified do not correlate with climatic factors, suggesting that climate does not act as an important confounding factor. yet, we cannot rule out the possibility that other infectious agents have affected the spatial distribution of the variants we identified as the diversity of helminths correlates with that of other human pathogens  <cit>  across geographic locations.

finally, although we searched for snps strongly associated with helminth diversity  and we applied a correction based on the maf-matched distribution of kendall's rank correlation coefficients, we cannot exclude that the spatial distribution of a fraction of the variants we identified is due to population demography, migration history and drift, therefore representing false positives.

despite these limitations we were able to identify several genes that can be regarded as good candidates as modulators of susceptibility to helminth infection as testified by our interaction network and panther analyses. mammalian hosts respond to parasitic worms in a relatively uniform manner by producing specific cytokines  and ige, as well as through the activation of effector cells such as eosinophils, basophils and mast cells  <cit> . overall, the response to helminth infection is th2-dominated and serves to both oppose the parasite and to contain tissue-damage. in line with this concept, il <dig> and il <dig>  as well as il <dig> are hub genes in two interaction networks we identified . nonetheless, the role of other immune components during helminth infections is becoming increasingly clear. in addition to th <dig> cells that mediate host response in some stages of schistosoma and brugia malayi infection , the role of regulatory t cells  is now recognized . an increase in tregs has been observed in different experimental mouse models of helminthiases and in infected humans . notably, among the  <dig> genes more strongly associated with helminth diversity  we identified two loci, namely cd200r1l  <cit>  and stim <dig>  <cit>  that are involved in the development and function of treg cells. additionally, we found several snps located upstream the transcription start site of ctla <dig> to strongly correlate with helminth diversity . the gene encodes a co-inhibitory lymphocyte molecule that is preferentially expressed by treg cells  <cit>  and is thought to be at least partially responsible for the hypo-responsive phenotype of th <dig> effector cells  which is often observed in helminth infections . as an example, blockade of ctla- <dig> during nippostrongylus brasiliensis infection results in higher th <dig> cytokine production and decreased parasite numbers  <cit> . ctla- <dig> competes with cd <dig> for binding to cd <dig>  . both cd <dig> and cd <dig> carry variants significantly associated with helminth diversity  and their binding provides a co-stimulatory signal for naive t cells; however, binding of ctla- <dig> to cd86/cd <dig> on dendritic and t cells leads to functional inhibition . similarly to ctla <dig>  both cd <dig> and cd <dig> have been implicated in the immune response against helminths. specifically, previous studies have indicated that anti-cd <dig> treatment blocks immune response to schistosoma mansoni and heligmosomoides polygyrus and cd28-/- mice display increased susceptibility to s. mansoni  <cit> . interestingly, we also found cd <dig>  another co-inhibitory molecule to correlate with helminth diversity . a recent report  <cit>  has shown that schistosoma induces anergy of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells by up-regulation of cd <dig> expression on macrophages. these latter cells are considered an important component of anti-helminth response and an alternative form of macrophages has been described in subjects infected by parasitic worms. these cells up-regulate arginase instead of inos and express specific molecules including retnlb  and chia  . notably, we found one snp in retnlb to significantly correlate with helminth diversity ; with respect to chia, we noticed that one variant  displayed a strong correlation with helminth diversity although it did not withstand bonferroni correction at the genome-wide level .

we found several integrins and adhesion molecules to correlate with helminth diversity . among these, itgam, itgal and itgax  encode integrin α chains that combine with the β  <dig> chain  to form leukocyte-specific heterodimeric integrins. these molecules regulate lymphocyte adhesion and transendothelial migration, playing therefore a central role in inflammatory processes. itgal and itgam are bound by neutrophil inhibitory factor , an antiadhesive glycoprotein isolated from the canine hookworm ancylostoma caninum  <cit> , suggesting that leukocyte integrins are relevant to the immune response to helminth infections. interestingly, more recent evidence  <cit>  has revealed that the genome of the human parasite necator americanus encodes at least  <dig> genes with similarity to nif, suggesting that their products might play a similar role in establishing an immunocompromised niche for the parasite. the itgam/itgb <dig> and itgax/itgb <dig> integrins bind ic3b , a cleavage product of complement component  <dig> . previous studies have shown that ic3b is deposited on n. brasiliensis larvae  <cit>  and c <dig> deficient mice carry high lung larval burdens  <cit> . in line with these findings, c <dig> is essential for killing strongyloides stercoralis larvae in mice  <cit>  and c3-/- mice do not develop an effective th <dig> response after infection with s.mansoni and cannot clear the parasite after chemotherapy  <cit> .

as far as the second network is concerned , it is worth mentioning that notch <dig> and ets <dig> have been implicated in multiple immune functions. the notch signaling pathway is involved in the intrathymic differentiation of t cells, as well as in th cell development in the periphery  <cit> . in line with the role of treg cells in helminth infection, notch <dig> has recently been shown to be involved in treg function  <cit>  and to cooperate with tgfb for regulation of the foxp <dig> promoter  <cit> . with respect to ets <dig>  it functions as a transcriptional regulator of several cytokine genes including il <dig>  il <dig> and gmcsf  <cit> . it also regulates expression of cd <dig>  <cit>  and it is known to induce of th <dig> mediated inflammation  <cit> .

also, network b  contains two genes coding for ryanodine receptors ; we also found ryr <dig> to correlate significantly with helminth diversity . the function of these molecules in the immune system is poorly understood yet, both ryr <dig> and ryr <dig> have been involved in calcium signaling in t cells  <cit> . moreover, recent evidences have indicated that dendritic cells express ryr <dig> and activation of the receptor causes a rapid increase in the expression of mhcii molecules on the surface of these cells  <cit> .

finally, it is interesting to notice that among the genes subjected to helminth-driven selective pressure in network b we found syk, encoding a tyrosine kinase that interacts with the high affinity ige receptor and mediates ige signaling in mast cells and basophils  <cit> . similarly, cd <dig> and fyn  have been involved in mast cell activation mediated by the high affinity ige receptor  <cit> , suggesting a role for these genes in allergic inflammation. indeed, syk has been shown to mediate airway hyper-responsiveness in an experimental mouse model  <cit>  and most genes discussed above have been involved in the elicitation of allergic phenomena. in addition genes reported in table  <dig>  the interaction of cd <dig> with cd <dig> is central to induction of allergic airway inflammation in mice  <cit>  and cd <dig> antisense oligonucleotides suppress airway hyper-responsiveness in allergic animals  <cit> . variants in c <dig> have been associated with asthma  <cit>  and mice deficient in c <dig> exhibit diminished airway hyper-responsiveness and lung eosinophilia when challenged with allergen  <cit> ; also, notch <dig> is involved cd8+ t cell-mediated development of airway hyper-responsiveness and inflammation  <cit> , while itgal/itgb <dig> mediates altered responsiveness of atopic asthmatic airway smooth muscle in rabbits  <cit> . finally, ets- <dig> induces tenascin expression in bronchial fibroblasts  <cit> . in this respect it is worth mentioning that, although subjects genotyped in the hgdp-ceph panel are supposed to be healthy, a proportion of them may suffer from relatively mild diseases including asthma, atopy and related disorders; this may be especially true in some areas such as latin america, for example, where urban centres have the highest reported prevalence of asthma worldwide . while this possibility does not affect the results we reported herein, it highlights the fact that the epidemiology of these disorders is rapidly changing, and several reports have revealed a general increase in prevalence with urbanization, leading to the suggestion that environmental factors  may play a central role in modulating the susceptibility to these diseases . the relationship between asthma/allergy susceptibility and parasitic worms is though to be complex . on one hand helminth-driven selective pressure is expected to favor individuals carrying alleles that allow a strong th <dig> response and, therefore to promote the transmission and spread of asthma-susceptibility variants. on the other hand, lack of parasites in developed countries has likely removed the immunomodulatory role of these organisms, eventually leading to the increased incidence of atopic conditions. the current knowledge of asthma/allergy susceptibility alleles  is too limited to warrant extensive speculation on the first issue. still, our data indicate that many genes we identified carry variants associated with asthma/allergy or have been involved in the elicitation of airway hyper-responsiveness. therefore, our results expand the previously noticed parallelism between genes involved in the development of asthma/allergy and those responsible for responding to parasitic worms, suggesting that the evolutionary scenario underlying the increase in asthma, allergy and related phenotype envisages a relevant role for these long-standing parasites.

among the genes subjected to helminth-driven selective pressure we identified edar and eda, its ligand. binding of ectodysplasin to edar activates the nf-kb pathway through the nemo protein. the eda/edar pair mediates signals needed for the development of ectodermal appendages and mutations in both genes result in hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia. many studies  <cit>  have indicated that edar has been subjected to a strong selective pressure resulting in the rapid spread of the putatively selected 370ala allele in asian populations. this allele is responsible for the hair phenotype of these populations but the selective pressure underlying the selective sweep is unknown. hypotheses have been proposed that increased hair thickness might be protective against cold climates or be favored through sexual selection  <cit> . we found that in asian populations, most chromosomes carrying the selected allele also carry four snps subjected to helminth-driven selective pressure . both eda and edar are expressed in human lymphocytes and dendritic cells , suggesting that they may function as nf-kb activators in these cell types, as well. it is therefore tempting to speculate that helminths represent the selective pressure underlying the spread of a selected allele in asia. this idea is consistent with the concept whereby infectious agents have represented one of the major selective forces for human populations.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our data are consistent with the notion whereby parasitic worms have acted as a powerful selective force on human populations and have contributed to shape nucleotide variability at a number of genes involved in immune responses. we also show that several genes associated with helminth diversity are involved in the pathogenesis of atopic conditions or in airway hyper-responsiveness.
