BACKGROUND
apple is amongst the largest consumed fruit in the world. during fruit maturation and ripening, apples undergo important metabolic changes consisting in the conversion of starch to simple sugars, the reduction in organic acid contents, skin colour changes, production of flavoured volatiles and flesh softening  <cit> . in some genotypes, mealiness may occur during storage. this modification in texture, often associated with excessive softening, makes apple fruits less attractive to consumers  <cit>  and increases costs for marketers due to a loss of quality and a higher susceptibility to pathogens  <cit> .

mealiness results from an undesirable ripening process and is characterized by textural deterioration, resulting in soft, grainy and dry fruit  <cit> . many reports about apple texture modifications during ripening have focused either on soft or mealy phenotypes. iwanami et al.  <cit>  underlined the coexistence of both phenotypes, suggesting that softening studies should consider the degree of mealiness to adequately investigate apple ripening process. microscopic observations led to the conclusion that mealiness is associated with the dissolution of the middle lamella and the disruption of the primary cell wall  <cit> . the authors suggested that these changes of the cell wall results in a loss of cell-to-cell adhesion, resulting in tissue fracture by cell-to-cell separation rather than by cell rupture during mastication of the fruit. fruit cell walls are a highly complex matrix composed of microfibrils of cellulose embedded in a network of hemicelluloses, pectins and proteins  <cit> . amongst the genetically-programmed biochemical events which occur during fruit ripening, cell wall modifications are the most described. many enzymes are involved in the dynamics of the cell wall during fruit development and ripening  <cit> . high α-l-arabinofuranosidase gene expression and enzyme activity levels have been reported as being related to mealiness  <cit> . pectin methylesterase  activity has been shown to be higher during the early stage of ripening in soft apple fruits  <cit> . both enzymes act on pectins  which render the cell wall matrix more accessible to other degrading enzymes such as polygalacturonases   <cit> . experiments with transgenic apple plants showed that pg <dig> activity is necessary for “royal gala” softening  <cit> . despite several studies, little is known about mealiness development and the associated molecular events. nevertheless, all reports have concluded that fruit ripening results from a complex mechanism that cannot be reduced to a single gene but rather involves a complex network. moreover it is likely that mealiness as a unique sensory parameter reports various biochemical and structural situations in different fruit species.

transcriptome analyses have the potential to screen many gene pathways simultaneously. in recent years, a number of studies have integrated these extensive data sets in order to investigate apple fruit ripening. most of them were based on ‘custom made’ microarrays developed from est apple databases. lee et al.  <cit>  used a  <dig>  cdnas array to identify  <dig> cdnas involved in the early stages of apple fruit development. janssen et al.  <cit>  undertook a similar study on “royal gala” and extended to the fruit ripening stages, using a  <dig>  gene apple oligonucleotide array. this same array was used previously to identify  <dig> putative candidate genes regulated by ethylene and involved in the production of aroma compounds in the fruits of transgenic lines of “royal gala”  <cit> . costa et al.  <cit>  focused on the ripening process of “mondial gala” using another apple est array and heterologous hybridization using a tomato array. a high density 23 k long-oligo apple array was designed by zhu et al.  <cit>  to compare transcriptome profiles between two cultivars with contrasted firmness and crispness phenotypes at harvest. distinct sets of genes from various metabolic pathways were classified as cultivar dependent and may contribute to the observed phenotypic variation such as xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase/hydrolase  genes involved in cell wall remodelling  <cit> . other apple microarrays were reported on apple tree scions  <cit>  and fruitlet abscission  <cit> . until now, all published apple transcriptome studies were restricted to a subset of identified transcripts. due to the availability of the apple genome sequence  <cit> , the aryane_v <dig> microarray representing the fully annotated genome was recently designed  <cit> .

the results presented in this study constitute the first whole genome analysis of apple and provide insight into molecular regulatory events involved in fruit mealiness development, which is considered as the development of an unfavourable texture trait. up to now, the most commonly used method to characterize mealiness was based on sensory analyses. as this method is rather time consuming and can be user dependent, a novel simple cell cohesion test was developed to assess mealiness. in addition, using the aryane_v <dig> microarray, six siblings from a population of hybrids with contrasting phenotypes for fruit mealiness were studied. as modifications leading to mealiness are probably initiated early in ripening, the expression profiles were studied over the complete fruit cycle from cell expansion to fruit cold storage. amongst all the differentially expressed genes, only a few displayed consistent and opposite expression profiles between all mealy and non-mealy genotypes leading to the identification of one malus x domestica member of the pectin-methylesterase  gene family. investigation through biochemical analyses suggests an essential role in mealiness development.

RESULTS
sensory evaluation of fruit mealiness during storage
apple texture including mealiness was evaluated by a panel of experts from harvest to four months of cold storage. mealiness assessment is based on the sensation of fruit dry flesh associated with a grainy texture. it is a genetically determined trait also dependant on environmental conditions  <cit> . in order to identify stable fruits phenotypes over the years, notations were repeated for four consecutive years and led to the selection of six hybrids . these hybrids are full-sibs from a population segregating for mealiness  <cit> . the three hybrids m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> produced non-mealy apples while the three hybrids m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> displayed mealy apples after cold storage. their degree of mealiness increased greatly between two and four months of cold storage. nonetheless, a slight influence of the production year was observed on mealiness notations. in  <dig>  apple fruits became mealy earlier displaying higher score at  <dig> and 120 days after harvest  when compared with the other years. on the opposite, in  <dig> the mealy hybrid m <dig> displayed a lowest level of mealiness at  <dig> dah than the other years . it is noteworthy that m <dig> was always less mealy than the  <dig> others hybrids m <dig> and m <dig> table  <dig>

measurement of fruit firmness on unpeeled apples using a penetrometer revealed no difference between mealy and non-mealy apple fruits at  <dig> dah . mealiness is therefore not correlated with the measurement of firmness in this study. however, the rate of softening, measured as the loss of firmness, between h and 60dah, was different between mealy and non-mealy apple fruits .the measured force decreased by  <dig> % between harvest and  <dig> dah for the mealy apples, and in contrast by only  <dig> % for the non-mealy apples.figure  <dig>

in order to assess fruit mealiness with an alternative method to sensory analysis, a cell cohesion test was developed. this test is based on the hypothesis that fruit mealiness results from cell detachment rather than cell wall disruption during mastication. from the mealiness evaluation of  <dig> apples fruits , a significant positive correlation was observed between sensory analysis and detached cell quantification  . this result confirmed the hypothesis that parenchymal cells of mealy apple fruits are less strongly bound to each other than cells from non-mealy apple fruits.

this hypothesis was further confirmed using sem imaging of parenchyma surfaces obtained from fractured apple flesh. representative images of mealy and non-mealy apple fruits phenotyped at harvest and  <dig> dah are shown figure  <dig>  at harvest , the fracture pattern of apples from all hybrids is characterized by the disruption of individual cells and the presence of air gaps. at  <dig> dah, the fracture pattern of non-mealy samples  presented a similar pattern to that observed at harvest, with burst cells. in contrast, mealy fruit patterns at  <dig> dah were characterized by a palissadic arrangement of the cells and minimal cell rupture . in accordance with the hypothesis, mealy apple tissues were fractured by cell detachment rather than by cell rupture.figure  <dig>

transcriptome characteristics of mealy apples
in order to characterize the transcriptome of mealy apples, the four genotypes which displayed the strongest phenotypic differences were studied as mealy  versus non-mealy  pairs over the developmental  and storage  periods during several years. the expression profiles of m <dig> and m <dig> apples were respectively compared to the expression profiles of m <dig> and m <dig> apples. differentially expressed genes were identified with significant p-values for paired sample t-tests . we hypothesized that genes involved in mealiness displayed a differential expression pattern for each pair of mealy/non-mealy hybrids. genes were selected only when they displayed identical expression patterns for both pairs  for at least one time point. thus, a total of  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts were selected at one or more developmental stages. the number of differentially expressed transcripts increased in concert with mealiness development: the main phenotypic changes were initiated about  <dig> dah which was also the time point displaying the highest transcription deregulation . based on mdp genes annotations, the differentially expressed transcripts were classified into functional categories . the most represented functions were linked to protein modifications , transcriptional regulation , biotic stress responses , photosynthesis , cell wall modification , and unknown functions . moreover, sense  and anti-sense  probes were designed for each annotated apple cds, and  <dig> % of the differentially expressed probes corresponded to as transcripts. celton et al.  <cit>  demonstrated relatively high levels of as transcription in apple fruits and seeds compared with other organs. this should be considered for further studies on fruit development as these as transcripts are likely to be involved in small interfering rna  dependent negative regulation of the coding mrnas.figure  <dig>

in order to validate the microarray data, the relative transcript abundances of a subset of differentially expressed genes were tested by rt-qpcr, using cdna from mealy and non-mealy apples. the results were in agreement with those obtained from the microarrays analysis . the observations of gene expression level differences between mealy and non-mealy apple fruits were similar with both techniques .

constitutively deregulated genes associated with mealiness
the majority of phenotypic changes associated with mealiness were observed 60 days after harvest. however, it is likely that molecular events are initiated early in the kinetic of fruit development. based on this hypothesis and in order to identify genes possibly useful as early molecular markers of mealiness, the study was focused on genes which displayed differential expression patterns during the entire apple fruit development and cold storage period. using these criteria,  <dig> genes were selected . apples from the m <dig> hybrid were always less mealy than apples from m <dig> and m <dig> . therefore, the third comparison between m <dig> and m <dig> apples was used to select genes involved in the development of fruit mealiness regardless of the severity of the phenotype. genes with two distinct profiles were selected. this drastic selection led to the identification of  <dig> relevant genes . thirteen genes were down-regulated at all time points for all  <dig> pairs such as mdp <dig>  similar to at5g <dig> from arabidopsis thaliana coding for a glycosyltransferase  potentially involved in pectin synthesis, and mdp <dig>  similar to at1g <dig> coding for a pectin methylesterase  involved in pectin modification. three transcripts were up-regulated including the as transcript of the gene mdp <dig> similar to at1g <dig> annotated as “wall associated kinase” . waks are pectin receptor-like proteins, and some arabidopsis waks have been shown to be involved in cell expansion during plant development  <cit> . apples are climacteric fruits and hormones, particularly ethylene, are known to play a central role during fruit maturation  <cit> . in this study, no genes related to hormonal pathways were differentially expressed during the complete time course. such results are not surprising as early cellular events during ripening are hypothesized to be less dependent on ethylene  <cit> . this strict selection can also explain why hormone-related genes are not revealed. however, ethylene production was measured during storage and no significant difference was noticed between mealy and non-mealy apples at all the time points . some genes displayed differential expression patterns at least at one time point, but none of them were validated using the third pair. this result does not question the role of hormonal pathways during apple ripening but it suggests that a hormonal pathway may not be the key regulator of mealiness in the studied population. moreover, fruit ripening results from both ethylene-dependent and ethylene-independent pathways  <cit> . these results support the hypothesis that mealiness and softening may involve two different mechanisms.figure  <dig>

these  <dig> selected genes are potentially involved in mealiness development during apple fruit ripening and cold storage. among them, the mdp <dig> gene coding for a protein annotated as a pme is one of the most relevant as pmes have major role in pectin remodeling in plant cell wall. pmes are known to be involved either in the stiffening or in the loosening of the cell wall  <cit> . in the case of fleshy fruits, the role of pmes is usually associated with pectin degradation that occurs during fruit ripening  <cit> . that is in accordance with the observation that parenchyma cells from mealy fruit tend to easily detached from each other due to the alteration of the pectin rich middle lamina. in the present study, mdp <dig> transcript expression levels were significantly higher in non-mealy than in mealy fruit during the whole kinetic of development , suggesting that this gene might be involved in cell wall stiffening. furthermore, the expression level of mdp <dig> was higher in m <dig>  compared to m <dig> and m <dig> hybrids . mdp <dig> transcript expression pattern was also consistent with phenotypic variations.figure  <dig>

mdpme <dig> cloning and the apple pme family
even if the probe aryane_v1_ <dig> was firstly assigned to the mdp <dig> gene, we actually showed that it reveals a close homolog of it: mdp <dig>  the complete cds sequence, hereinafter named mdpme <dig>  was cloned from m <dig> apples and was shown to share 97% of similarities to the mdp <dig> gene identified on the alternative genes set published  <cit>  . the probe sequence corresponding to mdp <dig> is only 80% similar to mdp <dig> sequence. semi quantitative rt-pcr clearly showed that only the mdp <dig> gene and not the mdp <dig> gene was expressed in both m <dig> and m <dig> genotypes . therefore, the probe designed on mdp <dig> sequence actually reveals the transcriptional activity of the mdp <dig> gene.figure  <dig>

in silico analysis of the mdp <dig> protein sequence, confirmed the presence of a processed amino-terminal pro domain similar to a pme inhibitor domain  followed by a complete catalytic pme domain . a processing motif  was also identified between both domains . this latter was described as a cleavage site suggesting the cleavage of the pro domain during the process of the protein maturation  <cit> . the current knowledge on the pme family and these observations support the hypothesis that mdpme <dig> codes for a pectin methylesterase.

in all studied species, genes coding for pectin methylesterases belong to large multigenic families and their members might be involved in different developmental processes  <cit> . to determinate if other mdpme genes are involved in development of fruit mealiness, all apple mdpme homologues were identified within the apple v <dig> genome sequence  <cit> .

based on protein similarities to the pme conserved domain ,  <dig> genes were identified as potential pectinesterase family members. molecular phylogenetic analysis showed that the mdpme family is divided in two groups. as observed with the arabidopsis atpme familly  <cit> , pme proteins from group type i are characterized by the presence of a pro domain which is absent in pmes from group type ii. the mdpme <dig> belonged to the type i characterized by pme proteins displaying a pro domains  .

moreover, mdpme <dig> displayed a unique differential expression pattern during fruit maturation among all mdpmes annotated genes . few pmes annotated genes displayed differential expression patterns between mealy and non-mealy apples, but none of them remained consistently differentially expressed during the kinetic of development. roles of other pmes in cell wall remodelling during apple maturation is not excluded. however, mdpme <dig> is the only gene of the family to be more highly expressed during the whole kinetic analysis in non-mealy hybrids compared with mealy apples. this result underlined the specific role of mdpme <dig> in apple mealiness.figure  <dig>

mdpme <dig> subcellular localization
to investigate the subcellular localization of the mdpme <dig>  a c-terminal translational mrfp fusion was generated and transiently expressed in n. tabacum leaves. the mrfp signal was predominantly observed at the cell periphery, consistent with expected cell wall localization . to further confirm the cell wall localization, transformed leaves cells were plasmolysed. as expected, the dehydration and compression of the cytoplasm induced dissociation of the plasma membrane from the cell wall. the mrfp signal was observed both in the apoplasm and in the cell wall confirming the exportation of the recombinant protein . this subcellular localization is in accordance with the possible role of the mdpme <dig> in the modification of the cell wall structure in mealy apples, particularly the pectin components.figure  <dig>

apple fruit pectin characterization
to investigate whether pectin was altered during ripening of apple mealy apples the degree of methylesterification  of uronic acids was determined on alcohol insoluble materials  from pairs  <dig> and  <dig> in  <dig> and  <dig> the dm was about 75% at 100dah. it decreased slowly until harvest and remained stable during cold storage . hence, these results indicated, as expected, that the apples underwent a de-methylation process through apple development before harvest and in early stage of ripening but they did not reveal global differences between mealy and non-mealy pectins when analyzed at the whole fruit level.

another approach was to investigate changes in apple pectin architecture. the fine structure of homogalacturonans  was determined using pectin enzymatic oligosaccharide fingerprinting with oligouronides mass profiling. the peak areas of individual ion signals of the mass spectra were used to calculate relative abundance of each structure allowing the identification of different patterns of methylation and acetylation on the oligouronides. a direct comparison of each oligouronide using kruskal-wallis tests showed significant differences between mealy and non-mealy apples. mealy apples displayed a significantly higher abundance of highly methylesterified structures  during almost the complete kinetic. non-mealy apples displayed higher abundance of highly methylesterified structures which are acetylated, such as du5m4a <dig> or du6m2a <dig>  mainly from 60dah onwards . these results are consistent with mdpme <dig> expression which is higher in non-mealy genotypes resulting in de-methylesterified blocks of free carboxyl groups. an abundance of highly methylesterified but acetylated moieties were also measured in non-mealy apples. o-acetylations of pectins may reduce pectin accessibility to pme enzymes  <cit> . therefore pmes may not act on these acetylated blocks. these results suggest that pmes demethylesterify pectin in a processive manner leading to demethylesterified blocks. some local structural rearrangements may explain some specific cell wall functionalities. furthermore, a putative pectin acetylesterase, mdp <dig>  was significantly less expressed in non-mealy hybrids  at 120dah . the role of a pectin acetylesterase is to cleave the ester bond between a glycosyl carbon and an acetyl group. this enzyme could deacetylated pectins of mealy apples which explains abundance of methyl but not acetylated structures. its low activity in non-mealy results in maintain of acetylated pectins which cannot be demethylesterified by pmes. this gene might play an interesting role in regulating pmes activities and targeting localized demethylesterification of pectins. but it could not be considered as an early molecular marker of mealiness.

discussion
a novel test to quantify mealiness
the confusion made between softening and mealiness results from the lack of easy and objective tests to assess mealiness. currently, softening is evaluated using a penetrometer by measuring the puncture force required to penetrate the apple flesh using a convex probe  <cit> . however, apple fruits may sometimes soften and in addition develop unfavourable traits such as mealiness  <cit> . mealiness has been assessed by measuring the tensile strength required to separate flesh cells  <cit>  or with sensory analysis performed by a trained panel  <cit> . in the present study, apples were assessed by sensory analysis which remains the most reliable method to evaluate mealiness  <cit> . indeed, mealiness revealed by sensory analysis was not revealed by penetrometry: no difference between mealy and non-mealy apples was detected based on puncture force. nevertheless, the softening rate was higher in mealy apples compared with non-mealy apples when assessed with penetrometry. these observations suggest that the rate of softening, rather than the absolute softness of the fruit, may be positively correlated with mealiness.

sensory analysis by a trained panel of four people is time consuming, expensive, difficult to transpose easily to other laboratories and the number of samples that can be analysed is limited. a few reports investigated some assumptions about cell wall modifications and apple fruit mealiness in order to develop a new test to quantify mealiness. assumptions are based mainly on microscopic observations of the fracture surface obtained via a tensile test. different modes of tissue failure can be observed such as cell fracture or cell-to-cell separation. mealy apples are characterized by neighbouring cells separating from each other at the level of the middle lamella without any damage  <cit> . sem observations support this first description of mealiness: cell walls appearing thicker and middle lamella stretching in mealy apples. mealiness may result from the separation of rounded cells during mastication which leads to a lack of juice and a sandy consistency. the development of the cell cohesion test to assess mealiness was based on this hypothesis. a similar test based on the measurement of the degree of cell separation by shaking flesh tissue disks in a sucrose solution for 8 hours was proposed  <cit> . in this test, mealiness assessment is based on the weight lost by the disks after shaking. however, cell to cell separation may be the result of individual cell isolation or of clusters of cells. this may lead to imprecision if considering that detachment of clusters of cells is due to an earlier stage of cell wall disassembly than detachment of individual cells.

a link between the observation of angular cells and flesh firmness has been established  <cit> . however the rapid method used to study cell morphology was based on fruit cell isolation and solubilization of pectin. this method is not appropriate for the characterisation of mealiness. in the present study, the cell cohesion test is a simple test able to discriminate mealy and non-mealy apple fruits within a very short time by quantifying only isolated cells that separated after shaking flesh tissue in water. this test requires little specific material and can be applied to multiple samples.

molecular characterization of apple mealiness
mealiness has often been associated with a defect in the adhesion and rigidity of the cell walls  <cit> . these phenotypes might be the consequence of cell wall disorganization carried out by several parietal enzymes  <cit> . however, only few genes coding for cell wall related proteins were identified in the present transcriptional study. among these genes, several transcripts displaying unexpected profiles were identified. first, a gene coding for a pme was less expressed in mealy apples although pmes are known to be involved in pectin solubilization  <cit> . secondly, as expression from a wak annotated locus was higher in mealy apples. genes transcripts in as orientation, often described as precursors of nat-as-sirnas, could play a role in post-transcriptional gene silencing of the complementary mrnas  <cit> . wak encoding genes are a small multigenic family. waks are supposed to act as signalling proteins that are trans-membrane receptors of pectin residues involved in plant defense responses  <cit> . it is possible that they are involved in the maintenance of cell wall integrity  <cit> . interestingly, this result suggests that wak as transcripts might indirectly play a role in apple cell wall integrity, resulting in stiffening of the cell wall. in contrast, another as wak transcript was less expressed in mealy apples, but its expression pattern was less consistent amongst the genotypes.

surprisingly, other genes would have been expected to be differentially expressed but they did not show differential patterns of expression between mealy and non-mealy apples. for example, polygalacturonases  which function is to depolymerise homogalacturonans by cleaving stretches of unesterified uronic acids  residues are believed to have a role in apple fruit softening. in  <cit> , the silencing of mdpg <dig> in “royal gala” resulted in firmer fruits. further analyses by  <cit>  shown that pgs are mainly involved in the advanced stage of apple softening. in our study, transcripts with sequence similarity to pgs did not display differential expression pattern between mealy and non-mealy apples during the whole time course. however, md-pg <dig>  was differentially expressed for both pairs only at 120dah  which confirm a role of md-pg <dig> in the advanced stages of mealiness development.

another gene, mdaf <dig>  encoding an α-l-arabinofuranosidase, has been suggested to be associated with mealiness in apple fruits  <cit> . the authors report distinct patterns of mdaf <dig> transcription between certain mealy and non-mealy apple fruits at harvest and after two months of cold storage. mdaf <dig> expression did not show a consistent profile in the three analysed pairs in this study, suggesting mdaf <dig> is not involved in the development of mealiness.

specific role of a mdpme <dig> gene in mealiness development
one mdpme gene, named mdpme <dig>  was identified as differentially expressed in all of the stages of fruit development in this study. mdpme <dig> expression remained decreased in mealy apples but remained high in non-mealy apples. mdpme <dig> expression was also affected by the fruit production year.

the majority of studies of the role of pmes in apple fruit ripening has involved measurements of pme activities from fruit set to over ripe stages in “mondial gala”  <cit>  or during cold storage of “fuji” and “golden delicious” fruits, classified respectively as firm and soft cultivars  <cit> . none of these cultivars have ever been classified as mealy. no link between the enzyme activity and mdpme mrna expression was demonstrated. in these studies, two different mdpme genes were identified. first, mdpme <dig>  which was shown to be specifically expressed in flowers and not in apple fruits  <cit> . a mdpme primer set was used by wei et al. to detect a second mdpme gene  <cit> . in the present work, the gene mdp <dig> possibly corresponding to the wei et al. primers, was not differentially expressed according to mealiness.

in silico analysis of the mdpme <dig> protein sequence revealed the presence of a transmembrane domain  required for protein exportation to the cell wall. localization of the mdpme <dig> protein by mrfp-tagged fusion protein experiments confirm its translocation into the apoplasm where the pme enzyme is hypothesised to act on the cell wall components.

amongst the  <dig> identified pmes, mdpme <dig> displayed a unique expression pattern suggesting a specific role during apple development. many studies have focused on the role of pmes in pectin depolymerisation during fruit ripening  <cit> . however, recent works tend to re-evaluate this role. in apricot, pme activity increased in a firm cultivar while it decreased in the soft cultivar  <cit> . anti-sense inhibition of slpe <dig>  a minor pme isoform in tomato fruits, results in fruits that soften faster than controls  <cit> . therefore pmes could be involved in the deconstruction of the cell wall during fruit development and storage by promoting the action of cell wall hydrolases such as pgs which can degrade the de-esterified pectins. pmes also may have a role in cell wall stiffening. de-esterified pectins interact with bivalent ions ca2+ and are hypothesised to form egg-box structures. this conformation is supposed to limit the access of pgs to the pectin backbone and therefore to prevent pectin degradation  <cit> . results from the present work are consistent with this second property. maintaining high expression of mdpme <dig> in fruit flesh would increase ca2+ bound to the cell wall, subsequently maintaining apple flesh integrity and thus preventing the apparition of mealiness.

moreover, significant differences were observed in the pectin fine structures between mealy and non-mealy apples while no significant changes were noticed in the degree of methylesterification of the aim. it has been demonstrated that pmes can de-esterify homogalacturonic acid  in various ways. they may act in blockwise or random manners creating micro-domains with different properties within the cell walls  <cit> . in agreement with the observation of calcium rich zones at tricellular junctions or the corner of intercellular spaces, which remain intact after the rest of the middle lamella had been degraded  <cit> , it has been suggested that local calcium linked gels of low-ester pectin could be responsible for intercellular adhesion  <cit> . this supports the hypothesis that the identified mdpme <dig> might locally change the pectin properties in a way that is not observable at a whole fruit scale but only locally. recently, differences of pectin structure were identified by immunodetection between two apple cultivars during fruit development  <cit> . ‘royal gala’, a soft cultivar, displayed more highly methylesterified hg regions in corners of tricellular junctions compare to ‘scifresh’, a firm cultivar, which is associated with corners filled with non or low methylesterified pectin. both results suggest that pmes could act locally. thus, mdpme <dig> might play a role in determining cell-to-cell cohesion during apple fruit ripening by regulating calcium binding to the cell wall.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, a new and simple method was developed to quantify mealiness and allowed the characterization of genotypes with contrasting phenotypes for this trait. analysis of differential expression profiles using the microarray method led to the identification of a number of genes that might be involved in mealiness development in apple fruits. amongst them, the mdpme <dig> gene seems to be a relevant molecular marker associated with apple mealiness. further investigations to specify the role of mdpme <dig> in the molecular events related to the development of mealiness would require an enzymatic activity characterization and antibody production.
