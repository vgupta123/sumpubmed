BACKGROUND
the identification of dna methylation at cytosines adjacent to guanine  sites was the first epigenetic mechanism and mark established  <cit> . the initial restriction enzyme based dna methylation analysis was biased to high density cpg regions that were subsequently referred to as cpg islands  <cit> . functional studies of the role of these cpg islands has lead to the dogma that they are the regulatory regions for dna methylation. more recent marks such as  <dig> hydroxymethyl-cytosine  <cit>  have expanded our understanding of the dna methylation. the technology to investigate dna methylation has advanced such that genome-wide dna methylation profiling and mapping is now feasible  <cit> . although cpg islands have been thought to be the primary regions to regulate gene expression  <cit> , more recent data suggests that the lower density cpg shores of islands may be important  <cit> . genome-wide epigenetic studies have also suggested that low density cpg regions of the genome appear more regulatory than previously considered  <cit> . cpg-rich and cpg-poor promoters appear regulated differentially, not only by dna methylation but also by the polycomb system  <cit> . recent literature suggests that lower density regions may be more important for distal regulation of gene expression  <cit>  through regulatory elements such as enhancers  <cit> . high density cpg regions such as cpg islands appear to regulate genome activity in house keeping and tissue specific genes  <cit> . although the low and high cpg density regions are critical for the regulation of genome activity, both appear to have distinct functions.

our laboratory has demonstrated that a variety of environmental toxicants can promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and phenotypic variation  <cit> . the molecular mechanism involved is that exposure of a gestating female during the period of fetal gonadal sex determination promotes the altered epigenetic programming of the germline which appear to become permanently programmed and transmit this altered epigenome to subsequent generations  <cit> . the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomena is defined as “germline mediated transmission of epigenetic information between generations in the absence of direct exposures or genetic manipulations”  <cit> . all the environmental toxicants studied have been shown to promote altered differential dna methylation regions  in the sperm, termed epimutations  <cit> . interestingly, the epimutation signatures observed in the sperm are exposure specific with negligible overlap between the specific epimutations  <cit> . characterization of these dmr and epimutation signatures has identified a major genomic feature associated with these dmr is a very low  cpg density  <cit> . the current report examined the epimutations previously identified in ten different studies to provide a novel perspective on the lower density cpg regions in the genome. we refer to these regions as “cpg deserts”.

RESULTS
the previously identified dmr for the transgenerational sperm epimutations involved a number of different studies  <cit>  and data sets including the f <dig> generation sperm epimutations from vinclozolin  <cit> , plastics compounds  and phthalates)  <cit> , hydrocarbons   <cit> , pesticides   <cit> , dioxin  <cit>  and ddt   <cit>  exposure lineages. the total number of unique transgenerational sperm epimutations examined is  <dig> dmr. each individual dmr was identified with a methylated dna immunoprecipitation  procedure followed by a genome wide promoter tiling array  protocol . a statistical difference in dna methylation between the f <dig> generation control lineage versus the f <dig> generation exposure lineage sperm used a p-value of p < 10-5

the cpg density of each of the dmr for all the treatments was identified using the number of cpg/100 bp to determine the density. analysis of the cpg density for these sperm dmr is shown in figure 2a and indicates a density < <dig> cpg/100 bp with the majority of dmr having  <dig> to  <dig> cpg/100 bp density. greater than 97% of the dmr had a <10% cpg density. these cpg deserts of < <dig> cpg/100 bp, termed cpg deserts, are present in all the sperm dmr examined , figure 2a. therefore, the cpg density of the epimutations was very low.figure  <dig>

in addition to the analysis of sperm epimutations, the somatic cell transgenerational dmr for testicular sertoli cells associated with testis disease  <cit>  and ovarian granulosa cells associated with ovarian disease  <cit>  from f <dig> generation vinclozolin lineage animals were identified. the epimutations were also selected based on a statistically significant difference of p < 10-5
 <cit> . the cpg density for these somatic cell dmr was also < <dig> cpg/100 bp, figure 2b. these somatic cell transgenerational dmr had negligible overlap with sperm dmr and with each other, such that they were cell specific  <cit> . therefore, both the transgenerational sperm and somatic cell epimutations had dmr that were “cpg deserts”.

discussion
consideration of the genomic features of the transgenerational sperm and somatic cell epimutations identified the existence of cpg deserts containing small clusters of cpg within the dmr. these epimutations are potential regulators of genome activity and are involved in the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon. germline epimutations are critical in mediating the transmission of altered epigenetic information between generations  <cit> . all tissues and cells derived from this altered germline epigenome will have an altered epigenome and transcriptome . a previous study demonstrated that all examined tissues have a dramatic tissue specific transgenerational transcriptome change in the f <dig> generation  <cit> . in addition, several specific cell types examined  have cell specific transgenerational transcriptome alterations in the f <dig> generation vinclozolin lineage animals  <cit> . in considering the role of the dmr and sperm epimutations the observation was made that these transgenerational differentially expressed genes clustered in regions of 2- <dig> megabases with many having the dmr present, and these regions were termed epigenetic control regions  <cit> . similar observations were made with somatic cell transgenerational transcriptome changes  <cit> . in considering the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of germline epimutations, the embryonic stem cells derived from these germ cells will have an abnormal epigenome. this suggests all cell types and tissues derived from the embryonic stem cells will have an altered epigenome and transcriptome  <cit> . any tissue sensitive to this altered transgenerational transcriptome will have a susceptibility to develop disease  <cit> .

observations suggest these epimutations have a genomic feature of cpg deserts that are speculated to have significant roles in regulating genome activity  <cit> . somatic cells have also been shown to contain epimutations and these dmr were generally distinct from the germline epimutations  <cit> . interestingly, these somatic epimutations also were present in cpg desert regions with small cpg clusters  <cit> . combined observations indicate the transgenerational epimutations primarily appear to be present in cpg deserts with small clusters of cpg in the dmr.

these dmr were previously shown to be exposure specific and had negligible overlap  <cit> , figure  <dig>  the dmr ranged from  <dig> to 2000 bp with a density of < <dig> cpg/100 bp and no cpg islands were observed, only small clusters of cpg, figures  <dig> and  <dig>  therefore, these cpg deserts do not appear to be cpg island shores,  <cit>  but are distinct. the cpg genomic maps of specific cpg deserts that had the dmr confirmed with bisulfite mass spectrometry suggested the small clusters of cpg may be an important functional part of the cpg desert. the “cpg” desert is defined as a 500 bp to 2000 bp differential dna methylation region with < <dig> cpg/100 bp and the presence of small cpg clusters, and the absence of cpg islands.

in considering the regulatory role and origins of these cpg deserts several previous observations were used. the first is that c to t conversions are the most frequent genetic point mutation, small nucleotide polymorphism , known to occur in a nearly order of magnitude greater frequency than any other snp  <cit> . therefore, evolutionarily this will lead to low density cpg regions developing in the genome. these low density cpg regions of the genome have been previously observed. in the event a cluster of cpg had a critical regulatory role for genome activity, these sites would be evolutionarily maintained as clusters of cpg within a cpg desert. therefore, cpg deserts may have important roles in regulating gene expression  <cit> . this speculation of the regulatory role of these dmr now needs to be further investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
in addition to the existing knowledge on the role of high density cpg islands and shores on the regulation of genome activity, the characterization of the transgenerational sperm and somatic epimutations suggests the importance of low density cpg regions, termed cpg deserts. attention should be placed in the future on cpg deserts, in particular when studies address epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon. the advantage of next generation sequencing, bisulfite conversion of cpg sites, and new bioinformatics tools will likely advance this area quickly. previous studies have also suggested low density cpg regions appear to be regulatory for genome activity  <cit> . the speculation is made that these cpg deserts with small clusters of cpg in dmr will have a critical role in the epigenetic regulation of genome activity.

these cpg deserts are initially identified through characterization of the sperm epimutations that mediate the environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and phenotypic variation  <cit> . the transgenerational somatic epimutations also have a similar genomic feature  <cit> . the similarities or differences in epimutations and genomic features such as the cpg desert between the f <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig> generations remains to be investigated. however, the f <dig> generation data presented reflects the transgenerational germline epimutations  <cit> . although these sites appear to be critical to the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic transgenerational inheritance, these cpg deserts are anticipated to have a much wider role in regulating genome activity associated with a large number of other biological phenomena and mechanisms.
