BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small  non-coding rnas  that regulate gene expression in eukaryotes. numerous mirna genes have been found in animal genomes. they are located either within intronic sequences of mrna-coding genes, or in intergenic regions. many mirnas are highly conserved throughout evolution . however, there are also taxa-specific mirnas  <cit> . one such mirna is iab- <dig> which is only described in insect species and is involved in wing formation  <cit> . the description of insect mirnas in mirbase  <cit>  remains largely restricted to diptera , hymenoptera , coleoptera , orthoptera  and lepidoptera , which all diverged about  <dig> million-years ago  <cit> . the insect species with the greatest number of mirnas  represented in mirbase is d. melanogaster, which until recently was also the only insect for which deep sequencing results have been combined with a thorough bioinformatics analysis  <cit> . this number has recently been surpassed in a study on the silkworm, b. mori  <cit>  and the locust locusta migratoria  <cit> . functional analyses of insect mirnas has been mainly restricted to d. melanogaster  <cit>  where they have been shown to affect multiple biological processes such as embryo development and tissue differentiation, cell proliferation or morphological changes. until now, no mirnas have been described from the hemiptera, a group of insects that includes many of the world's most damaging insect pests such as aphids, whiteflies, and scales.

mirnas are generated from genome-encoded precursors that form hairpin structures with imperfect base-paired segments. mirnas processing occurs in several steps . the primary transcripts  are essentially synthesised by rna polymerase ii and cleaved in the nucleus by the rnase iii drosha. the resulting  <dig> nucleotide-hairpin pre-mirna is exported in the cytoplasm and the final mirna maturation step is mediated by the rnase iii dicer that produces 18- <dig> nucleotide long mirna duplexes. one strand of this duplex is incorporated into the rna-induced silencing complex  and guides this mirisc to degrade, destabilize or translationally inhibit the mrna targets . post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by mirnas is highly complex since a single mirna can regulate hundred of genes, and a single gene may be regulated by multiple mirnas.

the newly assembled genome of the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum recently released by the international aphid genomics consortium  <cit>  has enabled the identification of mirnas in a hemipteran insect for the first time. aphids are herbivorous insects characterised by the unique ability to feed exclusively on phloem sap. the serious damage caused by aphids is partly due to their amazing ability to adapt to environmental variations  <cit> . this adaptive capacity is largely explained by their phenotypic plasticity that allows the production of distinct phenotypic morphs in response to environmental changes. this is illustrated by the switch of reproductive mode in response to seasonal changes: parthenogenetic females are produced in spring and summer whereas sexual females and males are produced in autumn . the pea aphid also shows a unique duplication of the mirna processing machinery suggesting that mirnas play a significant role in the life cycle of these insects  <cit> . here, we present a list of  <dig> a. pisum mirnas identified by combining in vivo and bioinformatic approaches. moreover, the regulation of these mirnas in phenotypic plasticity has been investigated and mirnas known to be regulated by insect endocrine pathways were identified as differentially expressed in different morphs involved in sexual and asexual reproduction.

RESULTS
identification of a. pisum mirnas
the recently sequenced and assembled a. pisum genome  <cit>  was used to identify mirnas in the pea aphid using three complementary strategies. first, mirnas listed in mirbase were used to identify pea aphid mirnas by sequence homology. second, small rnas extracted from parthenogenetic females of the pea aphid were sequenced by deep sequencing technology and analysed using the mirdeep program  <cit> . finally, the pea aphid genome was screened for putative mirna precursors using a new algorithm, gr <dig> 

in the first approach we blasted  <dig> insect mirnas  deposited in mirbase release  <dig> against the a. pisum genome. the  <dig> nucleotide-long genomic sequences surrounding each hit were investigated for their ability to fold into typical mirna precursor hairpins. in total  <dig> different putative aphid mirnas showed both sequence homology and a potential hairpin structure . these  <dig> a. pisum mirnas candidates corresponded to  <dig> precursors. the expression of  <dig> of them was verified by rt-pcr .

in the second approach we undertook deep sequencing of small rnas from a mixed generation sample of parthenogenetic female pea aphids. approximately  <dig> million sequences were generated, corresponding to approximately  <dig>  unique sequences. mirnas are known to show obvious size preference and tend to be between  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides in length. analysis of the length distribution of the pea aphid mature mirnas showed a peak at 22nt as previously reported in d. melanogaster. moreover, similar to other organisms, many of the predicted pea aphid mirna mature sequences  start with a uridine residue at their 5'end  <cit> .

these sequences were mapped on the pea aphid genome and analysed by mirdeep, which uses a probabilistic model of mirna synthesis by the dicer protein to score compatibility and frequency of small rna sequences with the secondary structure of the pre-mirna genomic precursor  <cit> .  <dig> sequences  were identified as potential mirnas corresponding to  <dig> unique a. pisum mirnas . of these,  <dig> corresponded to mirnas already identified by the homology search in mirbase . for the  <dig> remaining sequences, we checked for orthologs in other insect species, by searching for sequences homologous to the predicted precursors among the other available insect genomes. we also searched for orthologs by comparing a. pisum predicted precursors to the sequences of mature mirnas listed in mirbase. this analysis allowed the identification of  <dig> precursors, identified by mirdeep and gr <dig> that matched to mirna listed in mirbase. however, the predictions of mirdeep and gr <dig> for these  <dig> mirnas appeared to be the complementary strand mir* of conserved mirnas . among these  <dig> conserved mirnas, two  were missed by our first approach based on homology search because of the high stringency of our blast analysis. one of the mirdeep prediction parameters stated that the larger number of short-reads mapping to the stem corresponds to the mature mirna and that the opposite strand corresponds to the mir* sequence. this is based on the assumption that mature mirnas are more abundant that mir* in living cells. however, stronger expression of mir* compared to the mature mirna has been reported in various organisms  <cit>  and more and more evidences support a function for mir* as regulatory rnas  <cit> . this could also be also the case for some of the predicted mirdeep mirnas in the pea aphid.

mirdeep is a selective program for identifying mirnas from deep sequencing data that minimises the false positive rate. it selects reads that align exactly to the genome, at less than  <dig> different locations, and selects putative precursors of mirna that match a high number of reads on the hairpin structure where the mature mirna is supposed to be. using a pool of several  <dig> sequencing runs, friedl√§nder et al.  <cit>  showed that mirdeep was able to retrieve 89% of the known mirna from caenorhabditis elegans, and recovered 73% of the known mirna incorporated in a set of  <dig> solexa sequences from a hela cell small rna sample sequenced by solexa technology. in addition to mirdeep, in order to increase the number of predicted pea aphid mirnas, we implemented a complementary approach, called gr <dig>  this algorithm first screened the pea aphid genome for mirna putative precursors  using a classifier trained with a set of  <dig> validated pea aphid mirnas. gr <dig> then compared the selected hairpins to the solexa reads for biological validation and for identifying the mature sequence. the classifier selected  <dig> candidates from  <dig>  million genomic hairpins of more than  <dig> nucleotides. the comparison of these candidates with the  <dig>  sequences of small rnas previously obtained by deep sequencing confirmed the expression of  <dig> of them. these  <dig> precursors corresponded to  <dig> different mature mirnas . gr <dig> identified  <dig> new mature mirnas not found in mirbase or identified by mirdeep from  <dig> genomic precursors. none of these  <dig> mirnas have orthologues in other organisms.

altogether, the combination of homology search, mirdeep analysis of deep sequencing and gr <dig> scan of the genome allowed the identification of  <dig> mature mirnas candidates in the pea aphid . these  <dig> mature mirnas candidates correspond to  <dig> precursors of mirnas  . this is similar to the number of annotated mirnas on mirbase for d. melanogaster . for all these pea aphid mirna candidates, we have evidence of their expression since mature sequences have been detected either by rt-pcr and/or deep sequencing. it is admitted that micrornas identified by deep sequencing, have to be supported by multiple reads and/or by the existence of its complementary strand mir* . applying this rule to the pea aphid predicted mirna by mirdeep and gr <dig> lead to the subdivision between  <dig> a. pisum mirnas  and  <dig> mirna candidates  . these mirna candidates still require confirmation that will be provided by future extensive deep sequencing, such as in other morphs than parthenogenetic individuals used for this study.

genomic organisation of mirna precursors
as expected, the majority of mirna precursors  were located in intergenic regions  or introns  with the exception of two mirnas located in unassembled reads  , the remainders of the mirna precursors were located in regions annotated as exons from protein coding genes . however, only two of these correspond to predicted genes whose annotation is supported with biological evidence , encoding a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein k and a vesicular mannose-binding lectin. exonic mirnas have been previously described in mammals  <cit> . however, with a few rare exceptions, exons that encode mirnas do not code for proteins and are "mrna-like non coding rnas". the remaining  <dig> exonic mirnas of the pea aphid are found in predicted genes whose annotation is not yet supported by biological evidence. moreover, among the  <dig> mirnas identified within exon,  <dig> were well supported either by abundant solexa reads and/or the existence of mir*. this could indicate false prediction in the protein coding gene set, or that these predicted genes correspond to mrna-like non coding rnas.

we investigated the physical distribution of the  <dig> precursors of mirnas along the different assembled genomic scaffolds of the pea aphid genome.  <dig> %  of mirna precursors were identified as singletons  while  <dig> %  of mirnas precursors were distributed in  <dig> clusters composed of up to  <dig> mirnas per cluster . among the  <dig> pea aphid mirnas clusters,  <dig> clusters are composed of the same identical mature mirnas present as multicopy  with slight differences within precursor sequences, suggesting a very recent duplication of these mirnas. we identified  <dig> clusters composed of closely related mirnas  with slight differences in their precursor or mature sequences, and  <dig> clusters composed of different mature mirnas, suggesting more ancient duplication events. the length of these clusters varies from  <dig> nucleotides  to  <dig> kb.

two aphid mirna clusters are unusually long: cluster eq127026-cl <dig>  at  <dig> kb and cluster eq127560-cl <dig>  at  <dig>  this eq127026-cl <dig> cluster is also conserved in d. melanogaster and a. mellifera. moreover, long length mirna clusters up to  <dig> kb have been identified in the mouse genome  <cit> . cluster eq119865-cl <dig> , and cluster eq127026-cl <dig> also show similar organisation between the honey bee and the pea aphid genomes. however, some clusters conserved in d. melanogaster and honey bee have diverged in aphids. the duplication of api-mir- <dig> observed in the pea aphid genome has not been reported in other insect genomes. the cluster including let- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> conserved in d. melanogaster and in a. mellifera is incomplete in a. pisum, since api-mir- <dig> was not found. sequence analysis of the scaffold eq112277-cl <dig> containing ap-mir- <dig> and ap-let- <dig> showed a sequence partially homologous to mir- <dig> . however, the genomic sequence surrounding this putative mir- <dig> sequence did not show any hairpin structure. these variations in clusters organisation could indicate an adaptation for each insect order of their mirna gene contents possibly related to life history traits.

functional annotation of pea aphid mirnas
the  <dig> mature aphid mirnas were compared to other identified mirnas by using the homology based search program available at mirbase. only  <dig>  of the  <dig> aphid mature mirnas showed significant homology with known mirnas. the other  <dig> mirnas showed no significant homology to previously described mirnas and were designated ap-mirx. as not all putative mirnas from insect species are in mirbase, we searched for highly similar nucleotide sequences within whole insect genomes: d. melanogaster, a. mellifera, t. castaneum, a. gambiae and n. vitripennis. from the  <dig> putative new mirnas identified in the pea aphid genome,  <dig> similar sequences were found in other insect genomes. the remaining  <dig> mirnas are detected only in the pea aphid ; in parallel, most  mirnas identified in d. melanogaster were not found in the pea aphid. this high proportion of non-conserved mirnas among species is not surprising given the recent results obtained from different deep sequencing analyses of small rnas performed on several species: the correlation between sequence conservation and high expression level often observed for many mirnas before the development of deep sequencing erroneously led to the general conclusion that mirnas are highly conserved. however, the identification of low expressed mirnas allowed by deep sequencing suggested to glazov and collaborators  <cit>  that the only the most expressed mirnas corresponded to conserved mirnas. in the case of the pea aphid, we observed that on average, the new mirnas that have no homolog in other organisms are less represented in the solexa short reads than the conserved mirnas . this suggests that these new mirnas are less expressed and confirms the hypothesis of glazov et al.  <cit> .

expression of mirnas in alternative pea aphid morphs
aphids have a complicated life cycle characterized by a phase of viviparous clonal reproduction  that alternates with a phase of sexual reproduction. this switch is triggered by a sensing of the decrease of the day length in autumn . the different alternative morphs produced are: parthenogenetic females named virginoparae producing viviparous parthenogenetic females, oviparae sexual females, sexual males, and parthenogenetic females named sexuparae producing sexual males and females. the mechanisms by which aphids detect and respond to differences in day length are not known. mirnas have been implicated in modulating circadian rhythm responses in insects  <cit> . on this basis, it is reasonable to hypothesize that mirnas may also contribute to the regulation of aphid polyphenism.

the expression of the  <dig> pea aphid mirnas identified in this work was followed in the different female morphs using a microarray. the array included one probe for each mature aphid mirnas and its corresponding mir* and diverse controls . each probe was repeated  <dig> times in the array. small rnas for hybridization were extracted from virginoparae, sexuparae and oviparae females, in three independent experiments. the large majority of the mature mirnas hybridized to the chips; only four mature mirnas  and nine mir* gave no signal with any of the hybridizations. most mirnas and mir*  showed no statistically significant differences in their expression between the morphs. however,  <dig> mirnas  showed significant differences in their steady-state levels between the morphs . these  <dig> mirnas included  <dig> micrornas and  <dig> microrna candidates :  <dig> conserved mirnas and  <dig> new aphid mirnas. seven micrornas were differentially expressed between sexual oviparae and sexuparae, and  <dig> were differentially expressed between sexual oviparae and virginoparae.

interestingly, among them, ap-let- <dig>  ap-mir2a- <dig> and ap-mir <dig> showed differential expression between oviparae and the two other parthenogenetic morphs . ap-let- <dig> and ap-mir- <dig> were up-regulated in oviparae, and ap-mir2a- <dig> was down-regulated in oviparae. ap-let- <dig> and ap-mir <dig> belong to the same cluster and follow similar expression patterns. mir- <dig> is involved in apoptosis regulation during development  <cit>  and let- <dig> and mir- <dig> have been reported to be involved in metamorphosis  <cit>  and are up-regulated in response to ecdysone  <cit> , a hormone involved in insect development. three mirnas  and two mir*  showed different expression between the two parthenogenetic morphs: sexuparae and virginoparae, that differ by the type of embryos they contain , and by the conditions of rearing . four of these mirnas were specific to the virginoparae/sexuparae comparison, while ap-mir-x <dig> was also up-regulated in oviparae. these  <dig> mirnas are particularly interesting candidates for the switch of reproduction mode from parthenogenesis to sexual reproduction. three of these mirnas are newly-identified aphid mirnas and their function remains to be determined. interestingly, mir- <dig> has been shown to be regulated in d. melanogaster by ecdysone as well as by juvenile hormones  <cit> . juvenile hormones are known to be involved in aphids in the transduction of the photoperiodic signal from the brain to the ovaries during the switch of reproductive mode  <cit> . thus, our study has identified a strong candidate  as a putative regulator involved in reproductive polyphenism in aphids and opens new avenues for further functional analyses.

CONCLUSIONS
this work has established a catalog of mirna genes in the pea aphid that represents an essential base of knowledge-base for investigating the mirna post-transcriptional regulation of key biological traits for an organism whose adaptation is shaped by phenotypic plasticity. deciphering the gene regulation network between mirnas and their mrna targets in the pea aphid remains an objective that this study opens.
