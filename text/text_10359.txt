BACKGROUND
improving muscle mass and function is of a considerable clinical interest in therapeutic strategies for musculoskeletal disorders and has been assessed by several studies  <cit> . in the last decade, among all these approaches, dramatic attention has been focused on the regulation of the myostatin  pathway. indeed, myostatin is a key regulator of skeletal muscle growth and homeostasis. in mice, targeted inactivation of the gdf <dig> gene causes a large and widespread increase in skeletal muscle mass, resulting from a combination of muscle cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy. moreover, postnatal inhibition of myostatin signalling, through the delivery of neutralizing antibodies, myostatin propeptide injection or antisense rna showed skeletal muscle improvement when administered to mice of different ages  <cit> . the identification of myostatin-binding proteins capable of regulating myostatin activity further expanded the number of potential therapeutic targets  <cit> . thus, follistatin  can function as a potent myostatin antagonist, its overexpression in mice is found to enhance muscle growth  <cit> . the increase in muscle mass observed in transgenic mice overexpressing fs in muscle is even significantly larger than that observed in gdf8-/- mice  <cit> . however, follistatin is not a specific inhibitor for myostatin and binds also to other tgfβ including activin. in addition to follistatin, two other proteins have been identified that are involved in the regulation of the myostatin. follistatin-related gene is highly similar to follistatin and has also been shown to inhibit activin and multiple bone morphogenic proteins in vitro <cit> . growth and differentiation factor-associated serum protein- <dig>  is a secreted protein that contains multiple domains associated with protease-inhibitory proteins including a whey acidic protein domain, a kazal domain, two kunitz domains, and a netrin domain. it also contains a highly conserved module of cysteine-rich sequence termed the follistatin domain. gasp <dig> was shown to bind directly but independently to both mature myostatin and the myostatin propeptide and to inhibit myostatin activity but not that of activin or tgfβ <dig> in vitro <cit> . like its homologous protein gasp <dig>  gasp <dig> also has a high affinity for gdf <dig>  a secreted factor that regulates anterior/posterior patterning in the axial skeleton  <cit> . recent studies showed that both gasp <dig> and gasp <dig> bind growth factors tgfβ <dig>  bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> but do not inhibit in vitro their signalling activity  <cit> . gasp <dig> and  <dig> show distinct expression patterns both in the developing fetus and the adult. in the developing fetus, gasp <dig> expression is highest in the brain, skeletal muscle, thymus and kidney while gasp <dig> is abundant in the lung, skeletal muscle and liver  <cit> . in the adult, gasp <dig> is primarily expressed in the ovary, testis, and brain while gasp <dig> is in the pancreas, liver, and thymus  <cit> . to date, despite these data, little is known about the precise in vivo functions and protein interactions of these gasp proteins. to highlight the range and extent of gasp <dig> roles during mouse development and in adulthood, we have generated and characterized transgenic mouse lines that ubiquitously overexpress gasp <dig> under the control of a cytomegalovirus  promoter. six transgenic lines have been isolated and two were selected with different levels of overexpression of gasp <dig> in muscle, brain, heart, spleen, liver, lung and kidney for analyses. detailed phenotypic characterization shows muscle abnormalities but no obvious defects in other major organ systems.

RESULTS
generation of gasp <dig> transgenic mice
with the purpose of developing transgenic mice with constitutive expression of gasp <dig>  the cdna was cloned into a vector containing a cmv promoter. the transgene was liberated from the vector backbone by the enzymes sali and nsii as shown in figure 1a and was purified for microinjection. after reimplantation of the manipulated embryos, pups were screened for the presence of the transgene by pcr analyses of genomic dna from tail clips to identify those harboring the transgene dna. six of the  <dig> offspring carried the transgene construct in the genome. breeding lines were successfully established from all  <dig> founders by crossing them with a non-transgenic mouse. these lines were designated surgasp1- <dig>  surgasp1- <dig>  surgasp1- <dig>  surgasp1- <dig>  surgasp1- <dig> and surgasp1- <dig>  analysis of the f <dig> offspring showed that the transgene was for each line transmitted to ~ 50% of the litter as expected for mendelian inheritance. quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine gasp <dig> mrna levels from muscle and brain of f <dig> animals . as predicted, expression levels varied depending of the transgenic strain. we opted to pursue further phenotypical analyses on the two lines surgasp1- <dig> and surgasp1- <dig> because of their high gasp <dig> expression levels in both tissues. for each line, heterozygous male and female mice were crossed to produce f <dig> mice. about 75% of the f <dig> offspring carried the transgene. to determine their precise genotype, heterozygote or homozygote, and to estimate the integrated transgene copy number, semi quantitative real time pcr was performed as shown in figure  <dig>  the homozygous surgasp1- <dig> mice harboured  <dig> copies of the gasp <dig> transgene while the surgasp1- <dig> mice had  <dig> copies. the copy number was stable within all subsequent generations.

tissue-specific expression
in order to determine the tissue distribution of the transgene expression and its level, total rna was isolated from multiple tissues from the offspring of the surgasp1- <dig> and surgasp1- <dig> breeder lines and was subjected to quantitative rt-pcr amplification. as shown in figure  <dig>  the surgasp1- <dig> line had the highest expression  in all tested organs with a very high increase in kidney. although surgasp1- <dig> transgenic mice carried more copies of the transgene, they displayed a much lower gasp <dig> rna expression level with no significant overexpression in kidney and lung. western blot analysis of gasp <dig> expression in various tissues was performed using three different antibodies. we detected its expression in all surgasp1- <dig> tested tissues and only in the pancreas of wild-type animals . no positive signal was revealed in the other tissues of wild-type or surgasp1- <dig> mice, most probably because of the low level of expression of the protein or the potential lack of sensitivity of our western analysis.

transgenic mice are characterized by an increase in muscle mass
immediately after birth, the transgenic mice appeared normal. however, within  <dig> weeks after birth, homozygotes surgasp1- <dig> mice showed a significant increase in body weight of about  <dig>  grams compared to wildtype littermate mice . such a difference was also detected in older mice . a similar but milder phenotype was also observed in the surgasp1- <dig> line . from  <dig> weeks old, mice overexpressing gasp <dig> showed a hypertrophic skeletal muscle phenotype . increased muscle mass was also evident when we compared the wet weights of the gastrocnemius, rectus femoris and pectoralis major muscle groups of heterozygous or homozygous surgasp1- <dig> mice with those of the wild-type mice . similar results were observed for surgasp1- <dig> muscles . the increases were found in both sexes with a muscle weight gain of 35% for the gastrocnemius and rectus femoris, and 45% for the pectoralis major muscles from homozygous surgasp1- <dig> mice. the magnitude of these increases was correlated with the muscle expression level of the transgene. surprisingly, no significant defect in the development of the other tested major organs  was detected .

effect of the overexpression of gasp <dig> on body composition
to determine the origin of increased body weight in surgasp <dig> mice, analysis of body composition by echomri-500™ was performed allowing us to measure whole body fat mass, lean tissue mass, free water, and total body water in live animals without the need for anesthesia or sedation. this study revealed no change in total fat mass and lean mass in surgasp1- <dig> mice. it contrasts with data obtained with constitutive myostatin deficient mice which present a reduction in fat mass .

the increase in muscle mass results from hypertrophy rather than hyperplasia
to determine whether the increase in muscle mass resulted from a combination of increased fiber numbers and increased fiber sizes, we performed histological and morphometric analysis of the rectus femoris muscles from wild-type  and homozygotes surgasp1- <dig> mice . cryostat sections of muscles stained by hematoxylin-eosin or gomori’s silver impregnation indicated a substantial increase  in the fiber diameter of the transgenic mice . fiber typing was performed using the myosin atpase method allowing differentiating  <dig> fiber types: i, iia and iib  <cit> . all muscle fiber types increased in diameter in the transgenic lines . the relative proportion of type i, ii myofibers in wild-type, surgasp1- <dig> and surgasp1- <dig> rectus femoris muscle did not change significantly . furthermore, no difference was found in the total number of muscle fibers per cross-sections. these results suggested that increased muscle mass was due to hypertrophy rather than hyperplasia.

discussion
intensive efforts have been made over the last decade to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation and function of myostatin, a key negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth. the identification of several components of the myostatin-signalling pathway had important implications with respect for testing the therapeutic value of a myostatin antagonist in muscle wasting disorders such as duchenne muscular dystrophy  <cit>  cachexia and age-related sarcopenia  <cit> . among the known myostatin-binding proteins, gasp <dig> has been shown to inhibit myostatin activity in vitro and may maintain myostatin latency but no data was available on the effect of gasp <dig> when expressed as a transgene in all skeletal muscles of wild type mice. in the present study, we have generated a “gain of function” mouse model to further understand the in vivo roles of gasp <dig>  these mice carry a transgene containing the gasp <dig> coding sequence under the transcriptional regulation of the ubiquitous cmv promoter. as a consequence, gasp <dig> mrna expression is greatly enhanced in several organs including muscle, brain, spleen, liver, heart, lung and kidney. analysis of the two gasp <dig> transgenic lines with the highest transgene expression revealed a skeletal muscle hypertrophic phenotype. this might have been expected based on previous data indicating that gasp <dig> can function as a myostatin antagonist, similar to follistatin or the follistatin-related gene protein whose overexpression leads to an increase of the muscle mass. furthermore, viral delivery of a gasp <dig> expression cassette into adult muscle has been shown to induce increases in muscle mass and grip strength  <cit> . the surgasp <dig> mice have similar average life span compared to standard inbred laboratory mice  except the phenotype described in this paper, no other gross abnormalities were noted, even in elder surgasp <dig> mice . effects of elevated gasp <dig> on body growth were not observed before day  <dig> of postnatal life. the enhanced muscle growth occurs in both male and female animals with a more pronounced phenotype in male pectoralis major muscle. the individual weights of the gastrocnemius, rectus femoris and pectoralis major muscles were increased. the masses of other skeletal muscles were also increased. the sizes of other internal organs did not differ from those of control mice despite overexpression of gasp <dig>  unlike the myostatin-deficient animals or fs overexpressing mice, which exhibit both muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia, we only observed an increase in myofiber size without a corresponding increase in myofiber number in surgasp <dig> animals. as the number of myofibers in muscle is largely determined during prenatal development, the overexpression of gasp <dig> does not seem to provide prenatal effect. however, we cannot preclude that the lack of hyperplasia is not the result of a too moderate expression of the transgene during embryonic and fetal stages, although gasp <dig> is strongly expressed in postnatal  <dig> days mice . in the litterature, heterozygous mutations in the myostatin gene or surexpression of its propeptide have been reported to result also in hypertrophy and no hyperplasia  <cit> . taken together, these results may be reflective of an incomplete inhibition of the myostatin. moreover, zhu et al. <cit>  have described that mice carrying a dominant negative form of myostatin preventing the release of the mature myostatin from the propeptide exhibited a significant increase in muscle mass that resulted from myofiber hypertrophy and not from myofiber hyperplasia. as hill et al.  <cit>  suggested, gasp <dig> may inhibit the propeptide proteolysis to keep the myostatin in a latent and inactive form. such possible mechanism may explain the observed phenotype in the surgasp <dig> mice.

the body weight increment in surgasp <dig> mice is visible at  <dig> weeks of age. however, during animal growth, the body weight difference between wild-type and transgenic mice does not increase, indicating that the effect of gasp <dig> overexpression may arise during the first  <dig> days of life, probably by satellite cells activity or akt/foxo dependent signalling pathway . to gain insights into the molecular mechanism, we performed an expression array analysis of  <dig> genes involved in muscle development. from those, only  <dig> genes ccnd <dig> , actvr1c , myh <dig>  myod <dig> and pparγ were slightly down- or up-regulated in the surgasp <dig> mice . cyclin d <dig>  an important component of the cell cycle machinery has been shown to be a major intracellular target for myostatin during myostatin-induced g <dig> cell cycle arrest and proliferation inhibition  <cit> . ji et al. <cit>  showed that myostatin blocked the recruitment of p <dig> to the cyclin d <dig> promoter, resulting in the silencing of cyclin d <dig> gene expression. the increase of ccnd <dig> expression level in the surgasp <dig> mice is in accordance with those previous studies. the analysis of the gasp <dig> promoter revealed the presence of four pparγ binding sites. a negative feedback loop may exist and could explain the down-regulation of pparγ in the mutant mice. finally, most of the observed variations are related to an activation of the canonical wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway and are consistent with observations in gdf8-null mice  <cit> . the mrna expression levels of pax <dig> and pax <dig> genes which are expressed by postnatal satellite cells  <cit>  or members of akt/foxo pathway remained unchanged in surgasp <dig> mice when compared to wildtype. however, the activation or repression of this pathway is essentially due to postranslational modification. further studies are needed to understand the relevance of the akt/foxo signalling in the surgasp <dig> phenotype.

in mammals, myofibers are mainly classified into glycolytic and oxidative fibers based on their metabolic profiles. in mice, fast glycolytic fibers express the type iib mhc isoform whereas oxidative fibers express type i , the fibers expressing mhc iia are capable of both oxidative and glycolytic metabolism. we could show that gasp <dig> overexpression does not significantly change fiber type distribution while a lack of myostatin results in an alteration in the fiber type composition  <cit> . glycolytic  or oxidative  enzyme activities did not show any significant differences between wild-type and surgasp1- <dig> mice, confirming the above mentioned result .

interestingly, we do not detect a change in fat pad mass in our gasp <dig> transgenic mice. this result differs from the results reported for the myostatin knockout mice or transgenic mice overexpressing the myostatin propeptide in which a reduction in adiposity is observed  <cit> . recent literature showed that myostatin inhibition in skeletal muscle, but not in adipose tissues, is primarily responsible for a decrease of fat mass  <cit> . this effect on fat pad could reflect a regulation of myostatin independant from gasp <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our data provide definitive evidence of the role of gasp <dig> in vivo, in particular in muscle. in our transgenic mice, estimation of the amount of gdf <dig> associating with gasp <dig> will be an important issue, thus providing mechanistic insights into this association. we are currently crossing our transgenic mice overexpressing gasp <dig> on the myostatin null background to investigate if gasp <dig> stimulates muscle growth by additional mechanisms independent of myostatin inhibition like it has been shown in transgenic mice overexpressing follistatin presenting a quadrupling of muscle mass  <cit> . the related protein, gasp <dig> has also been shown to be capable of binding myostatin although gasp <dig> was not detected as one of the proteins bound to endogenous myostatin in serum  <cit> . gasp <dig> appears to be similar to gasp <dig> in its ability to bind gdf <dig> or gdf <dig> in vitro but effects of gasp <dig> on other tgfβ ligands are not yet known  <cit> . further research will be required to determine the exact roles of gasp <dig> play in vivo and its interactions with gasp <dig>
