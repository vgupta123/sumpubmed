BACKGROUND
starch, a polysaccharide composed of glucose molecules, is a common constituent of higher plants and can be found in all the organs being the major forms in which carbohydrates are stored  <cit> . biosynthesis and accumulation of starch takes place into two different forms of plastids, chloroplasts and amyloplasts, depending on the anatomical site. starch produced in chloroplasts is called transient starch and is a primary product of photosynthesis, along with sucrose. transient starch synthesised during daytime is degraded during the following night, providing a continued supply of sugars to sustain metabolism throughout the night and for export to sink organs  <cit> . whereas synthesis of storage starch, in plastids, takes place in storage organs such as tubers, roots and cereal grains. storage starch in cereal grains is a long term carbon store for the next generation where it is used as a source of energy during periods of dormancy and re-growth  <cit> .

glucose moieties in starch form two structural arrangements called amylose and amylopectin. amylose is a linear, or slightly branched molecule in which the glucose units are joined end-to-end by α- <dig>  linkages and typically represents about 25% of the starch granule  <cit> . amylopectin, the most abundant component of starch, is a much larger branched molecule containing a backbone of glucose residues linked through α- <dig>  linkages with around 5% of α- <dig>  glycosidic bonds  <cit> . these two molecules are packed together in insoluble granules into layers alternating between layers of semi-crystalline amylopectin and layers of amorphous amylose.

starch is economically important. it is the major source of calories in food and feed worldwide. it is also a functional polymer with potential to provide environmental friendly biomaterials  <cit> . in recent years there has been increasing interests in the potential health effects of starch intake since easily digestible polysaccharides are considered responsible for a large part of severe health disorders such as obesity, cardiac disease and diabetes  <cit> .

a rapid hydrolytic degradation of the bulk of dietary starch takes place in the lumen of the small intestine, making it a highly glycemic carbohydrate  <cit> . however, degradability of starch can vary considerably depending on origin, composition and physical state. in  <dig> englyst and coworkers identified a portion of dietary starch resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis escaping degradation in the stomach and the small intestine. this fraction was termed “resistant starch”   <cit>  and further analysis revealed that rs reaches the large intestine almost undigested, where it is fermented by anaerobic gut bacteria  <cit> . the major metabolic products of this fermentation are short chain fatty acids  mostly butyrate, acetate and propionate  <cit> . scfa, especially butyrate, are associated with many health benefits being the preferred source of energy for colonocytes triggering increased colonic blood flow, oxygenation and muscular contraction  <cit> . additional health promoting effects of rs include lumen acidification that is associated with growth inhibition of potentially pathogenic bacteria in favour of beneficial probiotic bacteria, stimulation of excretion and degradation of cytotoxic metabolite and increase in the absorption of na+, k+, ca2+ and mg2+ <cit> . rs can also inhibit inflammatory responses  <cit> , stimulate cell differentiation controlling mucosal proliferation  <cit> , genetic repair mechanisms and prevention of colon cancer  <cit> .

the proportion of amylose in starch has a direct positive correlation with rs content, reduced digestibility and lower glycaemic responses  <cit> . the exact nature and structure of rs are still complex and elusive, but the amylose component seems to decrease substrate accessibility to amylases mainly due to process stability and the rapid formation of very stable, double-helical, polysaccharide aggregates during a re-crystallisation process termed retrogradation <cit> .

in planta production of starches with high proportion of rs has caught considerable attention since such an approach can generate valuable enhanced health promoting qualities directly in the crop. bioengineering has successfully provided increased amylose starches in wheat  <cit> , rice  <cit> , potato  <cit>  and barley  <cit> . however, drastic yield penalty is observed  <cit>  and a pure-amylose line has never been produced before, and it is therefore general consensus that biosynthesis of pure amylose cannot be achieved directly in plants. by silencing all genes for starch branching enzymes  in barley with a single rnai hairpin, we here demonstrate for the first time a concerted suppression of all sbe genes, and show that this results in high yield production of pure amylose starch directly in cereal grains. this plant system provides a strategy for the production of a novel pure functionalized starch composition with biomaterial and health benefits directly in cereal grains. moreover, being the first true counterpart of the “waxy” or amylopectin-only starch types, the amylose-only barley represents a valuable model plant for fully understanding the full range of starch structural parameters from 0% to 100% amylose and its physicochemical properties  <cit> .

RESULTS
transformation of transgenic plants
we intended to silence all three genes of the family of starch branching enzymes in barley by rnai. earlier studies suggests that silencing of an entire family of genes may be done either by targeting a highly conserved region, if one exists in all members of the gene family, or alternatively by designing a chimeric single construct with a sequence of multiple specific targets  <cit> . we did not find enough homology among those genes to design a single target sequence, and therefore a chimeric construct with three elements targeting each of the three sbe genes was constructed . there was very little homology among the three different target sequences . transgenic barley lines of the cultivar golden promise were generated by agrobacterium-mediated transformation.

rt-qpcr screening and propagation of transgenic barley lines
 <dig>  independent transgenic plants were generated. insertion of the selection marker gene  was confirmed by pcr . expression of hairpin construct was detected in  <dig> of the lines  by rt qpcr . the two lines sbe rnai <dig> and sbe rnai <dig>  which showed the highest transcription levels of hairpin construct were selected and ten grains per line were propagated to generate t <dig> lines.

transcription levels of the hpt selection marker, hairpin constructs expression , sbe isoforms i and iia   and sbe isoforms i, iia, iib  were analyzed using rt qpcr in t <dig> generation lines. six plants, sbe rnai <dig> , sbe rnai <dig> , sbe rnai <dig> , sbe rnai <dig> , sbe rnai <dig> , sbe rnai <dig> , were found positive for transgenes expression and sbe downregulation. at the level of t <dig> plants both homozygous and hemizygous plants will be usually be present. therefore among the three offspring grains  called a, b and c for each of the plants there will be some that are not transgenic. in agreement with this we observed both grains with sbe silencing and grains without gene silencing from some of the plants. two plants, sbe rnai <dig>  and sbe rnai  <dig> , showing the highest level of gene expresssion suppression, were selected. the transcript levels of the three sbe isoforms detected in sbe rnai <dig>  endosperms as compared to control were 13% for sbei, 27% for sbeiia and 26% for sbeiib. for the sbe rnai <dig>  line the values were 15% for sbei, 48% for sbeiia and 36% for sbeiib . sbe rnai <dig>  and control plants were further propagated  in greenhouse and in semifield trials.

sbe activity assay
we extracted enzymes and measured starch branching activity in the endosperm of developing grains  from sbe rnai <dig>   and control plants grown in the greenhouse. with similarity to the reduction in gene expression , we found that starch branching activity in the suppressed line sbe rnai. <dig>  was reduced by 82% as compared to the control grains .

molecular size distribution analysis
amylose concentrations and molecular size distribution were analysed by a combined size exclusion chromatography  and iodine complexation staining approach . the chromatographic profile of control starch showed the major amylopectin peak eluting first with a maximum absorbance for the iodine starch-complex  between  <dig> and  <dig> nm and a wide amylose fraction eluting later with characteristic λ-max between  <dig> and  <dig> nm. these values are characteristic for amylose and amylopectin respectively, and the amount of amylopectin can therefore be determined from the sec from the area of the elution curve of samples with λ-max below  <dig> nm, whereas amylose content is determined from the area of the curve of samples with λ-max above  <dig> nm  <cit> . using this method we found that the amylose/amylopectin ratio for the control starch was  <dig> %/ <dig> %. in contrast the sbe rnai  <dig>  starch showed a double peak eluting almost all in fractions with λ-max above  <dig> nm, suggesting that these fractions are all amylose. traces of amylopectin, found in a single fraction at  <dig> ml corresponds to an amylose/amylopectin ratio of  <dig> %/ <dig> % .

thermal, swelling and solubility characteristics
thermal properties were analysed with dsc for the control starch and for starch extracted from the sbe rnai  <dig>  barley line . control starch had a peak gelatinization temperature at 66°c typical for amylopectin melting. no melting endotherm was detected in pure-amylose starch confirming virtual lack of normal amylopectin. in some samples a minor and very broad transition could be noted but this could be neither integrated nor quantified. an endotherm at approx. 95°c was seen for the sbe rnai <dig>  starch when melting at higher temperatures . peak melting temperature and melting enthalpy, Δh, of amylopectin in control starch is shown in additional file  <dig> 

swelling power trials demonstrated that the control starch started to swell at 68°c correlating with the dsc point of gelatinization at 66°c . the swelling of the control starch increased up to 100°c at which point this starch had swollen by  <dig> g water per gram of starch. while starch from sbe rnai <dig>  did not swell and remained stable at below  <dig> g water per gram of starch in the temperature interval tested. both starch types showed similar increased solubility, to approximately 70–80°c, reported as the ratio of total carbohydrate in the supernatant to total starch . after this point solubility of control starch dramatically increased up to approximately 60%, while solubility of amylose granules only increased to 20%. hence, the amylose-only starch has a dramatically decreased capacity for thermal hydration, swelling and solubilisation.

barley grain internal morphology
transgenic grains had a characteristic wrinkled shape . to check whether the grains internal morphology was affected a study with stereo binoculars and light microscopy was conducted on grains median and cross sections. sbe rnai grains displayed expanded endosperm cavities with a bilobated shape on the side bordering the endospermal transfer cells .

segregation ratio of the wrinkled phenotype
all the grains of each positive t <dig> plant were collected and the ratios of wrinkled/wild type  grains were assessed for each plant . the wrinkled trait was segregating in a classic 3: <dig> mendelian ratio. to analyse if this segregation of phenotype is linked to segregation of the transgene, we isolated genomic dna from seedlings germinated from  <dig> t <dig> grains  and tested for insertion of transgene by pcr using the primers hairpin fw and rev , which specifically recognizes the hairpin construct . pcr amplification of the gene gapdh was used as a positive control . ten of the grains had a wrinkled phenotype and these also contained the transgene hairpin, whereas  <dig> of the grains had a wild type phenotype and similarly the transgene hairpin was not detected in those, this indicates that the transgene hairpin segregates with the wrinkled phenotype.

grain chemical composition
whole flour from milled second generation  sbe rnai <dig> , sbe rnai <dig>  and control mature grains was used for β-glucan analysis. β-glucan contents in sbe rnai <dig>  and sbe rnai <dig>  wrinkled grains were 22% and 33% higher than the content of control grains .

the starch content in control grains,  <dig> % w/w ±  <dig>  s.d, as compared to starch content measured in sbe rnai <dig>  grains,  <dig> % w/w ±  <dig>  s.d, demonstrates that starch accumulation in transgenic grains was at level comparable to wild type barley. no difference in phosphate content between only-amylose and control starch was found.

starch granule structure
the purified starch was used for polarization light microscopy , scanning electron microscopy   and powder x-ray diffraction analysis  . the granules did not show any birefringence indicating no main molecular direction of the glucose-chains . as visualized with sem large disc-shaped a-type and spherical small b-type granules were present in control starch. multi-lobed, often elongated, rough and globose-shaped granules with no regular size distribution and a very rough surface morphology were prominent in amylose-only starch . the multi-lobed morphology of amylose-only granules may be explained by abnormal multiple initiations followed by fusions of small granules. the same characteristic morphology was observed in granules prepared from grains of t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> generations.

the diffraction peaks detected with xrd at 2θ for the control starch were typical for a-type  crystalline polymorphs with approximately 20% crystallinity. for the sbe rnai <dig>  starch a combination of b-type  and vh-type  crystalline polymorphs with totally 25% crystallinity of the starch and no trace of the original a-type polymorph was found.

yield
average number of spikes per plant was calculated from all semifield plants . a sampling was made selecting  <dig> random plants per pot . all the grains were counted in all spikes of these plants and the average number of grains per spike was calculated . grains from each plant were collected and weighed to determine the average mass of the grains . and finally the average yield per plant was estimated . pearson correlation coefficients  were calculated to assess the strength of the linear dependence among the yield components , demonstrating that yield loss in sbe rnai plants was mainly due to a lower number of spikes per plant, and to a lesser extent also due to a lower mass of single grains. this was seen as a decrease of  <dig> % in the average number of spikes per plant and  <dig> % in the average mass of the single grains in the amylose-only line sbe rnai <dig>  compared to control line. no difference was present in the average number of grains per spike among the two lines.

plant height
heights of t <dig> plants from control and sbe rnai <dig>  lines growing in greenhouse were measured at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days after sowing . measurements showed that  <dig> days after sowing the sbe rnai shoots were 37% shorter than control shoots, however this gap decreased gradually during plants growth, and was absent at full maturity at  <dig> days after sowing. these data indicate an initial slower growth of sbe rnai plants.

germination frequency and starch remobilization during germination
no difference was found in the germination frequency of sbe rnai <dig>  and control lines grains sown in semifield trial .

in vitro germination tests were conducted in destilled water in the dark to examine how biomass is remobilized into the new organs emerging at germination: radicle and coleoptie. after  <dig> days  <dig> % of grain mass was lost in control grains, whereas only  <dig> % of grain mass was lost in sbe rnai <dig>  grains . similarly, mass distribution into grain, radicle and coleoptile at day  <dig> demonstrated a lower biomass remobilization from grains into the emerged organs in the sbe rnai <dig>  grains compared with control grains, suggestion a slower degradation of the endosperm starch in the sbe rnai <dig>  grains .

pleiotropic effects of sbe rnai silencing on gene expression of starch synthesis genes
possible pleiotropic effects of the sbe rnai silencing on the transcription levels of other starch biosynthetic genes were investigated by rt-qpcr for starch synthase  ssi, ssiia, ssiiia, ssiv, granule bound starch synthase  gbssia, gbssib, glucan water dikinase  gwdi in t <dig>  rt-qpcr was performed in  <dig> dap developing endosperms of sbe rnai <dig>  and control lines. genes with significant up-regulation in the sbe rnai  <dig>  line as compared to the control line were ssi , ssiia  and gwdi . the most evident up-regulations were found for gbssib  and ssiv . all of these were mean values of  <dig> biological and  <dig> technical replicates .

in vitro starch degradation analysis and determination of resistant starch
in vitro degradation by pancreatic α-amylase and glucoamylase was employed to simulate the effects of small intestine hydrolysis and subsequent glycemic response of the engineered starch  <cit> . the assay was carried out for both native starch, gelatinized starch and retrograded starches, and in all three situations sbe rnai <dig>  starch was much more resistant to degradation than normal barley golden promise control starch . for the native and the gelatinized starches  data points were fitted using the sigma plot package  to a two parameters model: f =ax/, where “x” is the time and f the extent of degradation; “a” can be regarded as maximum asymptote and “b” can be regarded as the time to reach half of the maximum . maximum asymptote “a” was lower for sbe rnai <dig>  than for control in both native and retrograde starch, whereas the time to reach 50% of maximum enzymatic hydrolysis “b” was higher for sbe rnai <dig>  than for control in both native and retrograde starch. this demonstrates higher resistance to enzymatic degradation in the sbe rnai <dig>  starch than in the control starch. retrogradation from gelatinized starch  introduced a slow additional linear degradation parameter in the degradation curve, so that the data was better fitted to a three parameters model: f=ax/+cx, where “c” is the linear component, which was  <dig> %/hour in the control and  <dig> %/hour for the amylose-only starch .

a  <dig> parameters fit, f=ax/, was used for the native and the gelatinized starches, and a  <dig> parameters fit, f=ax/+cx, was used for the retrograded starch where “a” describes maximum asymptote, “b” time to reach half maximum asymptote and “c” is the linear component only valid for the retrograded sample.

na: not applicable.

based on the degradation data, the content of rapidly digestable starch , slowly digestable starch  and resistant starch  was calculated according to englyst  <cit>  definition . the amount of rs in sbe rna <dig>  was higher than for control starch for both native, gelatinized and retrograde starch . and similarly the amount of rds was lower in sbe rna <dig>  than for control starch for both native, gelatinized and retrograde starch.

discussion
starch branching enzymes  play a pivotal role in amylopectin biosynthesis by catalysing chain transfer by cleavage of an α- <dig>  linkage following a condensation of an α- <dig>  linkage  <cit> . in cereal species, such as rice, maize, barley and wheat, there are three classes of starch branching enzymes . barley  was genetically transformed to increase the starch amylose content by blocking amylopectin biosynthesis through silencing of all sbe genes. a single, multifunctional dna construct was designed with the intention to simultaneously target the expression of the three genes encoding isoforms of sbes in barley by rna interference  . we found that expression of all three sbe genes was simultaneously reduced in grains of transgenic plants . there was very little sequence similarity among the target sequences of the three different sbe genes , which suggest that the simultaneous silencing was not an effect of homologous inhibition to corresponding genes by one of the segments in the hairpin. this conclusion is in agreement with a similar approach in rice  <cit> , where it was demonstrated that up to three members of a gene family could be specifically silenced by a single chimeric hairpin construct of non-homologous segments. in this work the authors also conclude that transitive rna silencing where formation of sirna extent beyond the target sequence does not occur for endogenous genes in rice. we did not study that in this work, however it is unlikely that this would have an effect in the sbe gene family because of low sequence similarity among sbei, sbeiia and sbeiib. in line with the observed reduction of gene expression of the sbe genes we found that starch branching enzyme activity was reduced by 82% in the sbe rnai <dig>  line when compared with a wild type control line grown under similar conditions . this shows that the reduction in gene expression similarly reduced the level of enzyme activity.

using size exclusion chromatography , we found that the amylose fraction in control starch was  <dig> % of the total starch. in contrast, the amylopectin constituted less than 1% of total starch in sbe rnai <dig> , where instead a major double peak characteristic for amylose was identified . the λ-max for these fractions are all above  <dig> nm supporting that this starch fraction is amylose. some residual starch branching enzyme activity was observed in the sbe rnai <dig>  line suggesting that biosynthesis of amylopectin requires a certain threshold  of sbe activity. sbe activity below 18% of control is not capable of synthesising amylopectin and the possibility that the amylose deposited in the sbe rnai <dig>  line contains some degree of branching not detectable by the iodine staining cannot be excluded. however, the sbe rnai <dig>  line also had significant increased expression of some of the starch synthases , increasing the capacity for biosynthesis of non-branched starch.

amylopectin is a semi-crystalline material with distinct thermal characteristics  <cit> . the thermal and solubility properties of the starch of the amylose-only line was analyzed and compared to starch from control barley. the control starch had as expected a peak gelatinization endotherm typical for amylopectin when using differential scanning calorimetry  . this endotherm was completely absent in the sbe rnai <dig>  starch confirming the absence of normal amylopectin in this starch. the endotherm seen at approx. 95°c in sbe rnai  <dig>  starch  is characteristic of the amylose vh crystal polymorph and supports the presence of normal amylose. together with the sec data these results demonstrated that the phenotype was amylose-only with a characteristic molecular fingerprint of amylose. silencing of two sbe genes sbeiia and sbeiib in barley increases amylose content to a certain degree   <cit> . our data show that amylose-only barley can be obtained when simultaneous suppression of all of the three sbe genes is performed . this effect underlines the important role played by sbei in barley endosperm starch biosynthesis in contrast to the apparent non-functionality suggested for sbei in arabidopsis leaves  <cit>  and wheat endosperm  <cit> .

swelling and solubilisation of starch in aqueous systems, e.g. during cooking, are crucial for efficient enzymatic starch digestion leading to glycemic response. heating of granular starch in excess water disrupts the crystalline structure as an effect of breakage of the extensive hydrogen bonding network between water molecules and the hydroxyl groups of the starch. this causes granule swelling and gelatinization  <cit>  and the branched amylopectin, but not amylose is primarily responsible for this effect  <cit> . in control line the start point of swelling coincided with melting of amylopectin at 66°c. starch extracted from sbe rnai <dig>  did not show any visible swelling .

major suppression of enzymatic degradation rates and a major increase in the rs content fraction were found for the sbe rnai <dig>  starch as compared to control starch as evaluated by the englyst method for determination of rs. the amount of rs in the amylose-only starch was 90%, 65% and 68% respectively for native, gelatinized and retrograded starches . for comparison cooked banana and potato starches, which is considered very high in rs, do not exceed 30% rs. these data demonstrate important health-associated features of this novel all-native resistant starch. it also provides the last link to complete the compositional range of starch produced in the cell from 0% amylose, the so called waxy type starch  <cit> , to 100% amylose to generate the entire range of amylose:amylopectin ratios in plants important for completing our understanding of starch bioengineering.

the transgenic grains had a characteristic wrinkled phenotype  and the sbe rnai <dig>  endosperm cavity appeared elongated and enlarged. interestingly, the wrinkled seed is a phenocopy of the pea phenotype rugosus described by gregor mendel in his study on the laws of inheritance published in  <dig>  <cit> , which is also due to a loss-of-function in sbe activity  <cit> . the easily recognizable phenotype allowed us to score segregation . the phenotype segregated 3: <dig>  the fact that the sbe rnai construct permits simultaneous targeting of three independent sbe genes, is of particular practical importance in breeding. that is because segregation in a single locus is practically more feasible as compared to the traditional alternative of differential suppression by independent rnai constructs targeting each of the sbe genes  <cit>  or crossing of multiple individual sbe loss-of-function genes, which each segregates independently. the strategy has been presented previously by  <cit> . however this is to our knowledge the first time that the method has been applied in a situation where silencing of multiple independently segregating genes is necessary for achieving a particular biosynthetic product, which in our case is amylose-only starch. for higher plants this is especially important where many metabolic pathways are highly redundant due to presence of isoenzymes and gene families in metabolic networks  <cit>  and single gene loss-of-function is therefore often phenotypically silent.

increased amylose content in cereal grains has been demonstrated to be correlated with altered accumulation of others grain constituents like β-glucan and water content  <cit> . similarly in sbe rnai <dig>  and sbe rnai <dig>  wrinkled grains the β-glucan content was significatively higher than in control barley grains . cereal grain β-glucan has been shown to be associated with important dietary health benefits  <cit> .

simultaneous suppression of the only two classes of starch branching enzymes, sbe i and sbe ii present in dicotyledonous plants such as pea and potato using a single  <cit>  or a sequential  <cit>  round of transformation in potato led only to a partial suppression of the amylopectin content and a dramatic increase of starch phosphate. here we found that sbe suppression in barley had no significant effects on the content of starch bound phosphate . hence, the starch generated in this study provides for the first time an amylose-only model with no effects on starch phosphate.

starch granule morphology and structure were severely altered in the amylose-only chemotype . normal starch granule morphology and crystallinity arises from repeated amylopectin double-helical lamellae. the disordered morphology of the sbe rnai granules therefore reflects the lack of ordered amylopectin and suggests the presence of abnormal multiple granule initiations typical for high amylose chemotypes  <cit> . these novel granules are expected to compose new combinations of crystal polymorphic packing. there are two main starch crystalline polymorphs: the a polymorph present in cereal seed starch and the b polymorph typically found in tuberous storage starch, transitory leaf starch and amylose-rich starch. a third single helical vh polymorph is typical for amylose, especially in complexation with lipids, iodine or alcohols  <cit> . we found a shift from a-type in the control starch to a mixed b/vh-type polymorph in the sbe rnai line, typical for high-amylose starch  <cit> . such starch is also associated with resistance to enzymatic hydrolysis and dietary fiber-like properties  <cit> .

yield and germination were investigated in the t <dig> generation of sbe rnai  <dig>  plants grown under semi-field conditions. an analysis of the individual components contributing to overall yield: spike number, grains per spike and grain weight showed that the yield penalty in the amylose-only barley is mainly due to fewer spikes per plant, and to a lesser extent lower grain mass. all together, the overall yield was 22% below that of control plants grown under identical conditions, which is much less dramatic as compared to other high-amylose systems  <cit> . hence, the cereal system all-together has excellent potential for large-scale production of pure amylose. the wrinkled phenotype may indicate decreased starch content, however the starch content of the amylose-only grains was  <dig> %, which is only slightly lower than in the control starch .

no difference was found in the germination frequency of sbe rnai <dig>  and control grains . however, sbe rnai <dig>  line plants exhibited slower growth of the young plantlet as compared to control but the difference disappeared throughout later development . we hypothesized that this effect indicates an impediment of endosperm starch remobilization, during early development when the plant is dependent on the starch as a carbon source. the in vitro dark germination showing less grain mass for the control than for the sbe rnai <dig> after germination confirmed this hypothesis. less dry biomass had been redistributed to the coleoptile and radicle in the sbe rnai <dig>  grains  compared with control grains . this demonstrates the physiological importance of amylopectin in the structural ordering of carbohydrate to allow a more rapid energy remobilization.

the endosperm of developing sbe rnai grains had increased expression levels of a number of key starch biosynthetic enzymes. the most prominent increases were found for ssiv, and for gbssib which was previously reported to be specifically expressed in pericarp rather than in endosperm  <cit> . in durum wheat where sbeiia was silenced, a similar up-regulation of the genes encoding gbssi, ssiii, limit dextrinase  and isoamylase  <dig>  has been detected  <cit> . this general up-regulation of the starch synthases in cereals may explain how our amylose-only barley line can compensate starch synthesis, preventing severe yield loss as seen in e.g. high-amylose potato  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
an amylose-only starch was produced with high yield in the barley endosperm by implementing a new method of simultaneous suppression of the entire complement of genes encoding sbes.

the severe yield penalty most often observed for these kind of enzyme suppressions is supposedly counteracted by pleiotropic stimulation of a number of starch biosynthetic enzymes and, generally, high yield storage of pure amylose in cereal seeds is of interest for industrial-scale production of this polysaccharide. the high amylose grains had a characteristic wrinkled phenotype, which segregated in a 3: <dig> ratio. the fact that amylose-only barley can be obtained only when suppressing the expression of all the sbe genes reveals the functional importance for all sbe genes. finally, we demonstrated that amylose-only starch granules can be synthesized and deposited with very high proportion of vh crystallites and that amylopectin is not essential for granule crystallinity and integrity. such polysaccharides can have significant applications such as food additives to ensure improved health via large bowel fermentation of resistant starch.
