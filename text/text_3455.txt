BACKGROUND
phosphorus  is a major component of fundamental macromolecules in organisms and plays multiple roles in plants, especially in energy transfer, metabolic pathways and regulation of enzymatic reactions. however, p is the second most limiting element for plant growth after nitrogen. typically, its availability in soil is too low to meet the requirements of plant growth. therefore, many efforts have been made in the past to improve the ability of plants to acquire p from soils. these efforts have included the utilization of p transporters and, recently, micrornas   <cit> . mirnas are a novel class of non-coding small rnas  of approximately  <dig> nucleotides  in length. they are generated from stem loop-forming mirna precursors , which are processed from long primary mirnas , transcribed from genomic dna. in cytoplasm, only one strand  of mirna is loaded into the mirna induced silencing complex  and guides the argonaut protein  in mirisc to recognise and cleave mrna targets or to inhibit protein translation of the targets  <cit> . another strand  of the mirna is degraded via the degradation pathway. despite their small size, mirnas play an important role in the regulation of gene expression in various organisms. compared with other classes of rnas including mrnas, mirnas are more conserved across species.

with the advent of deep sequencing technology, multiple mirna variants have been identified in various species, tissues and physiological conditions  <cit> . these mirna variants are termed isomirs  <cit> , and result either from imprecise or alternative cleavage by the rnaseiii enzymes dicer  or drosha  during mirna biogenesis, or from post-transcriptional editing. isomirs can be classified into three major types: length variations, nt variations along the mirna and non-templated additions  such as adenylation and uridylation at the 3′ end  <cit> . all three types of isomirs have been suggested to have a biological role  <cit> . however, it is not clear if the generation of isomirs is a process that is regulated according to environmental conditions. the capacity and specificity of isomirs to regulate their targets relative to their canonical mirnas are also not well understood.

mir <dig> is the first mirna demonstrated to have an ability to increase plant uptake of p in plants  <cit> . its target has been identified as ubc <dig>  which encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating e <dig> enzyme, also known as phosphate  <dig>   <cit> . in transgenic plants, increasing mir <dig> transcripts reduces ubc <dig> transcripts  <cit> . it has been shown that the 5′-untranslated region  of ubc24/pho <dig> contains multiple sequences complementary to mir <dig>  <cit> . removal of these sequences stabilises the level of ubc24/pho <dig> transcripts under p deficiency  <cit> , indicating that these sequences are likely to be targeted by mir <dig>  the mir <dig> relationship with ubc24/pho <dig> in response to p starvation has been proposed to be conserved in angiosperms  <cit> .

however, the mir <dig> activity in targeting pho <dig> is quenched by ips <dig> , a long non-coding rna containing a sequence motif complementary to mir <dig>  <cit> . ips <dig> functions as a target mimic by using its motif to sequester mir <dig> from pho <dig>  thereby protecting pho <dig> from mir399-mediated cleavage. because ips <dig> lacks a mirna-mediated cleavage site, the interaction between ips <dig> and mir <dig> is stable. interestingly, the expression of ips <dig> is suppressed by pho <dig> per se, revealing autoregulation of mir <dig> and pho <dig> 

another p-upregulated mirna under p deficiency is mir <dig>  <cit> . mir <dig> targets spx-msf genes, dependent on p conditions. under low p conditions it targets spx-msf <dig> while under optimal p conditions it targets spx-msf <dig> <cit> . the spx-mfs genes have been predicted to be implicated in phosphate  sensing or transport  <cit> . in arabidopsis, mir <dig> is also shown to target the nitrogen limitation adaptation  gene, thereby playing a pivotal role in regulating pi homeostasis in a nitrate-dependent fashion  <cit> .

currently, little information is available on the relationship of mir <dig> or mir <dig> expression with p conditions in cereal crops. in this study, by analysing expression profiles of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  we identified  <dig> novel members of the mir <dig> family, and many isomirs and antisense srnas for both mir <dig> and mir <dig>  importantly, we identified several functional isomirs of the mir <dig> family. additionally, several small rnas  derived from the single-stranded loops of the hairpin structures of two mir <dig> genes were also shown to be functional by the detection of cleavage products of their predicted targets. furthermore, we also identified a potential regulatory network among mir <dig>  its target hvpho <dig> and target mimics hvips <dig> and hvips <dig> in barley under p-deficient and p-sufficient conditions. our data provide an important insight into the mechanistic regulation and function of mir <dig> and mir <dig> in barley under different p conditions.

RESULTS
presence of mir <dig> and mir <dig> genes in the barley genome
to date,  <dig> mir <dig> genes  and  <dig> mir <dig> genes  have been identified from various species and deposited in mirbase . all the  <dig> mature mir <dig> members  and  <dig> mature mir <dig> members  originate from 3p arms. the deposited 5p arm sequences in mirbase are only  <dig>  for mir <dig> genes and  <dig>  for mir <dig> genes. there is a dichotomy between the numbers of mature mirnas and unique sequences in the database. this can be explained by the very high level of conservation between mirnas of different species. although many mir <dig> and mir <dig> members/genes have been identified in various plant species, currently only one mir <dig> sequence, but no mir <dig> sequence, from barley is deposited in mirbase. given this scenario, we took advantage of our previously obtained srna datasets from shoots of p-deficient and p-sufficient barley  <cit>  to identify additional mir <dig> and mir <dig> genes in the barley genome. we first aligned all the srna sequencing reads to mirbase without mismatch, identifying seven mir399-like srna sequences with a total of  <dig> reads in p-deficient barley and five mir399-like sequences with a total of  <dig> reads in p-sufficient barley . all of the five mir399-like sequences from p-sufficient barley were detected and up-regulated in the p-deficient barley dataset. when up to  <dig> nt mismatches were allowed,  <dig> additional mir399-like sequences were identified in p-deficient barley , but no additional mir399-like sequences were found in p-sufficient barley. one of the mir399-like sequences was aligned with mir399d in antisense . compared to mir <dig>  only two mir827-like sequences, corresponding to osa-mir827a and ghr-mir827a, respectively, were perfectly matched in mirbase from the barley srna datasets . however, the homolog of ghr-mir827a does not map to the barley genome . when one nt mismatch was allowed,  <dig> and  <dig> mir827-like sequences were further identified in p-deficient and p-sufficient barley, respectively . of these,  <dig> were only detected in p-deficient barley while two were specific to p-sufficient barley . twenty of the mir827-like sequences common to both datasets were up-regulated in p-deficient barley, while three were down-regulated .

the detection of mirna genes by simply mapping the srna sequencing reads to mirbase may generate several errors:  some mirna ‘genes’ might not have a stem-loop structure or low mean free energy, because their pre-mirna sequences have not been assessed, and hence they may not be true mirna sequences;  some of the mapped reads might be isomirs ; and  some reads may have been erroneously generated from sequencing errors. in line with these points, we found that nine mir399-like sequences and all of the mir827-like sequences  do not perfectly map to the barley genome . we thus consider these sequences to be false positive detections. some of these sequences may be isomirs, as some nt variations occur at the 5′ ends or internal sequences, which are unlikely to be generated by sequencing errors.

in order to improve the detection of mir <dig> and mir <dig> genes, we used a prediction based on the miranalyzer algorithm  <cit> , together with the newly available barley genome assemblies  <cit> . in total, we found ten mir <dig> genes and one mir <dig> gene. the ten mir <dig> genes are hvu-mir399- <dig>  hvu-mir399- <dig>  hvu-mir399- <dig> and hvu-mir399- <dig>  mir399b, mir399c, mir399d, mir399e- <dig>  mir399e- <dig> and mir399k . the first four mir <dig> genes give rise to the same mature mirnas and hence they are given the same name, but with a unique suffix of an identifier number. of the identified mir <dig> genes, only one  is currently annotated in mirbase, but the corresponding 5p arm is not annotated in mirbase. the other nine mir <dig> genes are novel . mir399- <dig> and mir399- <dig> not only have the same mir399-3p sequence but also have the same mir399-5p sequence, which was covered by five reads in our experimental data from p-deficient barley. the 5p sequence of mir399- <dig> was not detected in our datasets, but the theoretical sequence only differs in one position from the mir399-2-5p sequence. it is very likely that the hvu-mir399-3p sequence in mirbase is derived from hvu-mir399- <dig>  as some reads mapped uniquely to this sequence and not to the other three mir <dig> genes. furthermore, the annotated mir <dig> gene in mirbase does not show a canonical biogenesis, allowing us to rule out that the mature guide strand was obtained from this gene. this does not necessarily mean that the mirbase mir <dig> gene is a false positive, but only that in barley shoots it seems not to be processed accordingly to a mirna. for mir399e, which includes two genes, mir399e- <dig> and mir399e- <dig>  we found both genes give rise to the same mir399e-3p sequence but have different mir399e-5p sequences. the remaining mir <dig> genes have both 3p and 5p arm sequences detected from the srna datasets. all of the pre-mir399s form stem-loop structures, with mature mirnas located in the stems .

alignment of mir <dig> 3p sequences  revealed high homology. only three nt vary among the ten mir399-3p sequences. by contrast, the mir <dig> 5p sequences  only share three conserved nt. if the 5p sequence of hvu-mir399- <dig> is excluded, the conserved number of nt increases to seven. the overall sequence identity among the ten mir <dig> genes is about 35%. the lowest sequence identity is between hvu-mir399- <dig> and hvu-mir399c , while the highest identity is between hvu-mir399d from barley cv. barke and hvu-mir399d from cultivars morex or bowman . by contrast, mir <dig> gene sequences in mirbase are less conserved, because they originate from different plant species .

by detecting novel mir <dig> genes at a genomic level, we could resolve that the perfect match of the read ‘tgccaaaggagaattgccc’ to the mirbase sequence of tae-mir <dig>  is a false positive, as this read mapped in the barley genome to the same location as mir399b, showing that it is a 3′ truncated isomir of mir399b and not a novel mir <dig> gene homologous to tae-mir <dig>  examples such as this enforce the need for a genome sequence to reliably detect novel mirnas. while many false positives detected using the mirbase mapping approach have low read counts, setting a stricter threshold on the read counts could result in bona-fide mirnas being missed. for example, in our barley datasets, while mir399k gave low read counts, both arms were perfectly covered by sequencing reads.

only one mir <dig> gene was found in the barley genome, whose 3p and 5p arms were both represented by reads . surprisingly, from this gene other 3p and 5p arm sequences of mir <dig> were also detected by reads .

genomic location of barley mir <dig> and mir <dig> genes
currently, three barley genome assemblies from varieties morex, bowman and barke are available  <cit> . all the mir <dig> gene sequences, except for mir399- <dig>  could be found in each of the three barley genome assemblies. mir399- <dig> is only found in the morex and bowman genome assemblies, but not in the barke assembly . similarly, the mir <dig> gene is only found in the morex and barke genome assemblies, but not in the bowman assembly . the chromosomal locations of all mir <dig> and mir <dig> genes were determined from the barley assemblies , and were confirmed by southern blot hybridization with barley-wheat addition lines . the mir <dig> genes are distributed in the long arms of chromosomes 1h, 2h, 3h and 7h, of which 7hl contains five mir <dig> genes, while the others each contain two mir <dig> genes . the hvu-mir399b and hvu-mir399e- <dig> genes formed a cluster, as did hvu-mir399- <dig> and hvu-mir399- <dig> . the distance between the two genes in each cluster is around  <dig> nt . the orientation of hvu-mir399- <dig> is the same as that of hvu-mir399- <dig>  while the orientation of mir399b is the same as that of hvu-mir399e- <dig> . consistently, mir <dig> members in the rice genome were also found to form clusters  <cit> .

further location analysis showed that hvu-mir399b is localized within an intron, while hvu-mir399e- <dig> is localized within an exon of a protein-encoding gene confirmed by rt-pcr. hvu-mir399c, hvu-mir399d and hvu-mir399k were also localized within introns. intriguingly, hvu-mir399- <dig>  hvu-mir399- <dig>  hvu-mir399- <dig>  hvu-mir399- <dig>  hvu-mir399e- <dig> and hvu-mir399k each have one or two homologous sequences either in a cluster form or in different locations. it is unclear whether these loci are functional. hvu-mir <dig> locates to chromosome 2hl , within an intronic region of a gene.

expression profile of mir <dig> and mir <dig> genes under different phosphorus conditions
to compare the obtained read counts  between the sequence datasets obtained from p-sufficient and p-deficient barley, we used the rpm  expression value, calculating the number of reads mapped to a given element out of each  <dig> , <dig> input reads. this measure is independent of the total number of input reads and can be used for an unbiased comparison between different samples. we found that mir <dig> was more highly expressed than any of the mir <dig> genes . in p-deficient shoots, we detected  <dig>  sequence reads corresponding to the guide strand  while under p-sufficiency only  <dig>  reads were detected . this difference corresponds to a fold-change of nearly  <dig>  the rpm expression value shows that under p deficiency, mir827-3p made up nearly  <dig> % of all mapped input reads.

among mir <dig> genes, mir399k-3p was the lowest expressed . the other mir <dig> genes varied within a very small range from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . although the expression values of the guide strand were similar among the different mir <dig> genes, the fold-changes between p-deficient and p-sufficient samples varied significantly. for example, mir399e-3p was expressed over 90-fold more highly under p deficiency, whereas the increase in mir399c-3p expression under p deficiency was only  <dig> -fold. the most strikingly p-regulated mir <dig> gene was mir399d, for which we could not find a single read in the p-sufficient dataset. by contrast, we identified  <dig> reads belonging to the guide strand of this mirna in the p-deficient dataset. it is not known how mir399d is regulated under p conditions, but there is likely to be a p-controlled switch for expression of this mirna under certain p conditions.

as expected, we generally observed high ratios between the read counts of the guide strand and the passenger strand for most mir <dig> and mir <dig> genes . for example, for mir <dig> we found nearly  <dig> times more reads from the 3p strand while for mir399- <dig> and mir399d we found the ratio to be around  <dig> . those high ratios strongly suggest that the passenger strand is degraded while the guide strand is functional. however, there were three notable exceptions in the data in additional file 5: table s4:  <cit>  although at an overall low read count, the read count of the passenger strand  of mir399k was five times higher than that of the guide strand  ;  <cit>  there were almost the same number of reads for each of the 3p and 5p arms of mir399b ; and  <cit>  for mir399c the reads from the guide strand were only slightly higher  than those from the passenger strand. additionally, a modified read from mir399c-5p was observed, which might have a functional mirna/mrna interaction.

intriguingly, for both mir399c and mir399b, for which we observed low 3p/5p arm ratios, we found that the 5p passenger strand is differentially expressed more strongly than the guide strand  due to p conditions. the 5p arm of mir399b shows a  <dig> -fold increase in expression under p deficiency, while the guide strand  is only up-regulated by  <dig>  folds . similarly but less pronouncedly, for mir399c-5p we observed a  <dig> -fold increase in expression in the p-deficient barley, while for mir399c-3p there was only a  <dig> -fold increase . this stronger differential expression of the passenger strand might suggest the presence of an alternative biogenesis pathway in which the passenger strand is incorporated  into the mirisc complex. the detected target cleavage product for mir399c-5p could support this possibility.

to better estimate the expression levels of mir <dig> and mir <dig> under different p conditions, quantitative real-time pcr  was performed. we firstly used a forward primer specific to mature hvu-mir <dig> or hvu-mir <dig> sequences, and a universal reverse primer. the expression level of hvu-mir <dig> was  <dig> -fold higher under p-deficient conditions than under p-sufficient conditions , which was consistent with the read abundance of this mirna in the p-deficient and p-sufficient barley sequencing datasets. this suggests that srna sequencing data can be used for assessing the expression levels of srnas. similar to mir <dig>  the expression level of mir <dig> was also  <dig> -fold higher in p-deficient barley than in p-sufficient barley , suggesting that both mir <dig> and mir <dig> may function in p homeostasis in barley. the expression level of mir <dig> was 50-fold higher than that of mir <dig> under p-deficient conditions . because the initial primers used for qrt-pcr could not distinguish between different members of the mir <dig> family, we designed specific forward and reverse primers according to the pre-mir <dig> sequences . qrt-pcr analysis showed that four pre-mir <dig> genes were expressed at much higher levels in p-deficient barley than in p-sufficient barley , which is consistent with previous studies  <cit> . however, pre-mir399k was expressed at a lower level in p-deficient barley than in p-sufficient barley . all the other pre-mir399s were expressed at very low levels in both p-deficient and p-sufficient barley, below the detection limits of qrt-pcr . these results, combined with the read abundance of mature mir399s, reveal the existence of different expression between the mature mirnas and the pre-mirnas in the cells. the expression profile of pre-mir <dig> was found to be similar to its mature mirna, which was about  <dig> -fold higher in p-deficient barley than in p-sufficient barley . taken together, these results indicate that the expression of mir <dig> members and mir <dig> are clearly affected by p conditions in barley. however, how they are affected by p and whether the resultant differential expression is involved in different functions in barley remain unclear.

profile of mir <dig> and mir <dig> isomirs and alternative biogenesis pathways
different putatively functional srnas can be generated from the same pre-mirna sequence  <cit> . a typical example is isomirs, which have been shown to be functional in plant species  <cit> . recently, isomirs became the focus of mirna research and most mirna variants might have the capability to change the target gene repertoire of the canonical sequence. analysis of isomirs of mir <dig> and mir <dig> showed that both adenylated and uridylated reads were present for all guide strand mature sequences under p deficiency . under p-sufficient conditions, we only found uridylated or adenylated reads for mir <dig>  but not for mir399- <dig>  interestingly, we found that the strongest modified mature sequence under p deficiency is hvu-mir399c-5p, which has nearly 10% of uridylated reads . furthermore, mir399c is the least differentially expressed mirna, perhaps due to the destabilizing potential of uridylation  <cit> . mir399c-3p, mir399-3p and mir399k-3p did not show adenylation and uridylation at their 3′ ends .

a previous study showed that the most frequent length variants of mirnas are  <dig> nt shorter or longer than the canonical version at their 3′ and 5′ ends  <cit> . however, we found that the most frequent length variant in mir399- <dig> is one truncated by  <dig> nt at the 5′ end, which almost makes up 10% of the total variants, for example, those in mir399c-3p . these variants have potentially different targets compared to the canonical sequence.

apart from the generation of isomirs, we also analysed if there might be any other differences in the biogenesis of mirnas under p sufficiency and p deficiency. we observed that mir399- <dig> generates a number of srnas under p deficiency which are absent under p sufficiency . the alignment pattern shown in additional file 3: figure s <dig> indicates that at least four different and unique srnas are generated from the mir399- <dig> pre-cursor sequence. however, we didn’t find targets for these srnas in our degradome library, so currently we cannot confirm that the generation of these fragments has function.

another interesting observation is that mir <dig> generates two, overlapping bona fide mirnas . apart from the canonical sequence, we found a second pair of mature/mature* mirna sequences that show a perfect  <dig> nt 3′ overhang as expected from a canonical dcl processing. in plants, it was previously observed that a single pre-mirna sequence can give rise to several different srna molecules. however, as far as we know this is the first time that two different, but overlapping mature mirnas have been detected. this suggests that within barley shoots, the mir <dig> precursor is processed in two different ways: i) to generate the canonical form which shows dramatic differences between p deficiency and p sufficiency in its frequency; and ii) the alternative form that overlaps with the canonical and which does not show differential frequency between p deficiency  and p sufficiency . only the canonical biogenesis pathway appeared to be regulated by p.

surprisingly, we found a few sequence reads from the loops of the hairpin structures of mir399b and mir399e- <dig>  although the read length of these was short, ranging from  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt only . loop-derived srnas have been found previously in drosophila <cit>  and have been shown to be functional  <cit> , suggesting that the reads derived from the single-stranded loops of mir399e- <dig> and mir399b in barley may not be randomly generated and may be stable and active in cells. this would in turn suggest that they contribute to target specificity, as their sequences are different from the canonical mirnas from the same pre-mirnas.

targets of mir <dig> and mir <dig> and their isomirs in barley
targets of mir <dig> and mir <dig> were first predicted using psrnatarget. a total of  <dig> targets for the mir <dig> members and  <dig> targets for mir <dig> were predicted . some targets have functional annotations, while others do not. a number of targets contain multiple target sites, and are targeted by either the same mirna or different mirnas. for example, the gene encoding dna primase  has two predicted sites specifically targeted by hvu-mir399g, while hvpho <dig> has five predicted target sites, targeted by different mir <dig> members .

predicted targets of mir <dig> and mir <dig> were validated using a barley degradome library constructed by rlm-5′-race  technology. the advantage of using a degradome library is that the cleavage sites of mir <dig> or mir <dig> targets can be identified without requiring a priori mirna target prediction. in total,  <dig> targets of mir <dig> and  <dig> targets of mir <dig> were detected in the library , some of which corresponded to target identities that were predicted bioinformatically, while others had not been predicted. the detected targets of mir <dig> and mir <dig> indicate that both mirnas have diverse and complicated function. it is to note that the targets listed in additional file 9: table s <dig> also include those of putative mir <dig> and mir <dig> genes that were not identified in our barley srna datasets but were annotated in mirbase.

consistent with previous studies, many cleavage sites occurred at positions 10– <dig> relative to the 5′ end of the mirna . however, cleavage sites occurring at other positions within the targeted site were also observed . intriguingly, although hvpho <dig> targeted by mir <dig> contains five predicted mir399-interacting sites in the 5′ untranslated region  <cit> , only two of these  were found to be cleaved, and occurred at positions 10– <dig> relative to the 5′ end of the mirna . by contrast, in arabidopsis four of the five mir399-interacting sites  <cit>  in the pho <dig> gene were reported to be cleaved  <cit> . why the other three mir399-interacting sites could not be cleaved by mir <dig> in barley is unknown, but likely linked to the expression level of the mir <dig> member that specifically cleave the site, and this may be tissue- or condition-dependent. with the exception of mir399d, all mir <dig> members cleaved both interacting sites  <dig> and  <dig> . furthermore, all mir <dig> members cleaved the hvpho <dig> target at an equal efficiency as judged by the fragment frequency.

to further confirm the targets of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  some of the targets detected in the degradome library for mir <dig> and mir <dig> were selected for qrt-pcr to determine their expression levels. it is expected that a given mirna and its target would show an inverse relationship in expression level. indeed, qrt-pcr analysis showed that when the levels of mir <dig> or mir <dig> increased under p deficiency, the levels of most of the selected target transcripts decreased . however, one target  of mir <dig>  which encodes cytochrome p450-like tbp  and plays important endogenous and exogenous roles in the oxidative metabolism  <cit> , did not reduce its expression level in p-deficient barley where the level of mir <dig> increased . on the other hand, its cleavage product was detected in the degradome library and many p450-derived srnas were detected in the srna datasets. therefore, it is inferred that other unknown factor may be involved in the expression of mir <dig>  which is irrelevant to the regulation of the target. it is worth mentioning here that this target is named as mloc_ <dig>  and annotated as aquaporin  <dig> in the mips barley database  <cit> . in order not to be tangled, all the genes described below would be given both accession no and gene name from the mips barley database. if the genes are not found in the mips barley database, then they would be given only accession no.

targets of isomirs of mir <dig> and mir <dig> were also directly examined using the barley degradome library. we found several targets for isomirs derived from mir399- <dig>  mir399c, mir399b and mir399d genes but not for those derived from other mir <dig> genes or from mir <dig> . these functional isomirs include mono-adenylated reads from mir399c-5p . in addition, we found that one target  was cleaved by isomirs derived from three mir <dig> genes at two different positions . furthermore, this target can also be cleaved by their canonical mirnas.

as described above, several sequence reads were identified from the loops of the hairpin structures of mir399b and mir399e- <dig> , and were implied to be functional. accordingly, in the barley degradome library we found that these reads cleaved their predicted targets .

antisense sequences of mir <dig> and mir <dig> in p-deficient and p-sufficient barley
the detection of both arm sequences of pre-mir <dig> and pre-mir <dig> in p-deficient and p-sufficient barley prompted us to investigate antisense sequences of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  surprisingly, every mir <dig> or mir <dig> was found to have an antisense sequence . the antisense sequences of hvu-mir399d in p-deficient barley were even more abundant than their sense sequences . in p-sufficient barley, with the exception of hvu-mir399c and hvu-mir <dig>  all of the mir <dig> antisense sequences were more abundant than their sense sequences . however, there were no significant differences in antisense read abundance for any of the hvu-mir <dig> genes or the hvu-mir <dig> gene, between p-deficient and p-sufficient barley . by contrast and as described above, significant differences were observed for sense read abundance for all of the hvu-mir <dig> genes and for the hvu-mir <dig> gene between p-deficient and p-sufficient barley . the sense reads of hvu-mir399d and hvu-mir399k were not present in the p-sufficient barley dataset , suggesting that these two mirnas are tightly regulated by p. intriguingly, while mir399k has no sense read in p-sufficient barley, its antisense reads are the second most abundant in this dataset . perhaps the expression of sense rna of mir399k is sequestered by its antisense rna under p sufficient conditions.

the antisense sequences of mir <dig> were not abundant in either the p-deficient or p-sufficient barley datasets . however, the ratio of sense to antisense mir <dig> was significantly different between p-deficient and p-sufficient barley. in p-deficient barley, this ratio was  <dig>  while in p-sufficient barley it was only  <dig>  which is a more than 13-fold difference between p-deficient and p-sufficient barley. whether the high level of expression of mir <dig> in p-deficient barley results from a lower number of antisense sequences under p deficiency relative to p sufficiency is an interesting question to speculate upon. some of the antisense reads identified for mir <dig> and mir <dig> may function as mimics to protect the targets of these mirnas from cleavage. this could explain why some of the predicted targets of mir <dig> and mir <dig> were not identified in the barley degradome library . one mir <dig> mimic target has previously been identified in barley  <cit> .

determination of mir <dig> cleaving hvpho2
the target gene hvpho <dig> of mir <dig> contains five predicted mir <dig> target sites. by examining the degradome library, we confirmed that interacting sites  <dig> and  <dig> in hvpho <dig> were cleaved by mir <dig>  however, it was not known which of the ten mir <dig> members cleaved these sites. to determine this, we firstly aligned all mir <dig> sequences with interacting sites  <dig> and  <dig> in hvpho <dig>  we found that hvu-mir399-3p  has a single nt deletion relative to target site  <dig>  and two mismatches to target site  <dig> . by contrast, all the other mir <dig> members have a single nt deletion and one mismatch to target site  <dig>  and 1– <dig> mismatches to target site  <dig> . hvu-mir399k contained a mismatch at position  <dig> relative to the 5′ end of the mirna, to both target sites  <dig> and  <dig> . next, we examined the abundance of the mir <dig> members in the srna datasets. as described, all of mir399s had similar read abundance under p deficiency except for hvu-mir399k, which was much less abundant . taking these results together, we inferred that target site  <dig> would most likely be cleaved by hvu-mir399-3p , followed by hvu-mir399b-3p and hvu-mir399e-3p , while target site  <dig> would most likely be cleaved by hvu-mir399b-3p and hvu-mir399e-3p . hvu-mir399k may not be able to cleave the target due to its low expression level and the mismatch at position  <dig>  which is a pre-requisite for this position to be cleaved. the role of this mirna in barley is unclear.

base-pairing of the other three target sites in hvpho <dig> with the mir <dig> genes was also analysed. none of the mir <dig> genes had less than  <dig> mismatches to target sites  <dig> and  <dig>  thereby making these two sites the most diverse . furthermore, a mismatch at target site  <dig> occurs within the mirna seed sequence important for recognising the target sequence, presumably making it difficult for this target site to be cleaved by mir <dig>  in arabidopsis, no mismatch occurs within the mirna seed sequence to any of the five predicted target sites, and hence most of the target sites are cleaved  <cit> . unexpectedly, although target site  <dig> in hvpho <dig> was perfectly matched to the abundant hvu-mir399-3p  , its cleavage product by these or other mir <dig> genes was not found in the degradome library, suggesting that additional factor may control the selection of mirna cleavage sites.

correlation of mir <dig>  its pho <dig> target and ips target mimics in p-deficient barley
previous studies showed that p deficiency-induced ips genes are target mimics of mir <dig> and can protect the targets of mir <dig>  such as pho <dig>  from mir399-mediated cleavage  <cit> . we also showed that under p deficiency in barley  roots, where hvips <dig> and hvips <dig> were expressed at high levels  <cit> , increased mir <dig> did not reduce the transcript level of hvpho <dig>  a pho <dig> ortholog in barley  <cit> . to see whether this is the same case in barley shoots, we examined the expression levels of these three genes  under the same p conditions as for barley roots  <cit> . qrt-pcr showed that hvpho <dig> was expressed at higher levels under p-sufficient conditions than under p-deficient conditions , consistent with observations in arabidopsis <cit> , but not in rice  <cit>  or in barley roots  <cit> . by contrast, hvips <dig> was expressed at higher levels under p-deficient conditions than under p-sufficient condition . however, hvips <dig> expression did not differ between the two p conditions .

to further explore the correlation among hvu-mir <dig>  hvips <dig>  hvips <dig> and hvpho <dig>  we aligned all the reads from the p-deficient and p-sufficient barley datasets with hvips <dig>  hvips <dig> and hvpho <dig> transcript sequences in both sense and antisense directions. we found no reads derived from hvips <dig> or hvpho <dig> transcripts, but several reads derived from hvips <dig>  in p-sufficient barley . however, none of these reads were located in the mir399-interacting portion of the transcript sequence . by contrast, hvips <dig>  hvips <dig> and hvpho <dig> transcript-derived reads were identified in the p-deficient barley dataset, although the read number for each transcript was limited . in contrast to the reads derived from hvips <dig> or hvips <dig> transcripts, which were located outside the mir399-interacting sequence, the reads derived from hvpho <dig> were mostly located at mir <dig> target sites . we also found a number of reads derived from the antisense strands of hvips <dig> and hvips <dig> transcripts, all of which were only found in the p-deficient barley dataset . in addition, these reads were all located outside the mir399-interacting portions of the sequences . reads derived from the antisense strand of the hvpho <dig> transcript were also detected, more abundantly in p-deficient barley than in p-sufficient barley . all of these reads were located at the target sites of mir <dig> . these findings are important because they imply a mirna regulation network that is more complex than expected. however, more work is required to gain an understanding of how these genes and sequences are coordinated, and regulated by plant p status.

discussion
we identified ten mir <dig> genes in barley. in rice nine mir <dig> loci exist  <cit> , while in dicot arabidopsis and soybean, six and five mir <dig> loci are present, respectively  <cit> . all of these mir <dig> genes are up-regulated under deficient p, but generally expressed at low levels in these plants. numerous previous studies have shown that gene expression is controlled by upstream elements such as the promoter  <cit> . however, when we analysed upstream sequences of mir <dig> genes in plants, we could not find high sequence similarity for these upstream sequences. this suggests that the control of the expression of mir <dig> genes is independent. in support of this hypothesis, we found that different mir <dig> genes in barley are differentially expressed under the same conditions. this in turn suggests that other factors are involved, which may control the activity of upstream elements of mir <dig> genes. such factors may either be common or unique to each mir <dig> gene, but associated with plant species, tissue specificity, developmental stage and/or environmental conditions.

in addition to the identified mir <dig> and mir <dig> genes, we also identified many isomirs of mir <dig> and mir <dig> in barley. based on previous studies, these isomirs may not be attributable to sequencing errors or alignment artefacts  <cit> , but are likely generated from the imprecise cleavage of dicer or from post-transcriptional editing. corresponding to this hypothesis, we found that the ends of most of the identified isomirs of mir <dig> and mir <dig> fit the type cleavage product from dicer. however, some isomirs of mir <dig> or mir <dig> may be generated from different pathways, because their lengths vary significantly relative to their canonical mirnas  <cit> . the specific origin of isomirs of mir <dig> or mir <dig> remains unclear. intriguingly, we found ntas at the 3′ ends of some isomirs of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  and that these additions do not favour specific nt. a similar situation has been observed in animals, in which any nt can be added at the 3′ end of a mirna  <cit> . however, uridylation  and adenylation  are relatively dominant ntas. in animal mirna isomirs, a u at the 3′ ends was proposed to help, while an a at the 3′ ends was anticipated to hinder, association with the mirisc  <cit> . however, we found that mir <dig> isomirs with an a addition also cleave their predicted targets in vivo. this suggests that the a addition differs little from the u addition in the ability to incorporate into the mirisc and permit function. in contrast to the 3′ terminal variations, the 5′ terminal variations are predicted to have more impact on the determination of targets  <cit> . this is because in mature mirnas, the 5′ terminal sequences are used for guiding ago protein to cleave the targets.

recent studies have shown that mirnas can be generated from loop strands and function  <cit> . in line with this new discovery, we identified several srnas derived from the loops of the hairpin structures of mir399b and mir399e- <dig>  that were able to cleave their predicted targets . however, how these functioning loop-derived srnas were generated is unknown. it is likely that an alternative mirna processing pathway may apply, which produces mirna-like srnas independent of the dicer process. this has been the case for mirtrons  <cit> , snorna-derived mirnas  <cit>  and trna-derived mirnas  <cit> . another possibility is that pre-mirnas could directly be loaded into the mirisc and processed into mature mirnas or functional srnas by an unknown exonuclease. nevertheless, the emerging number of studies in this area suggests that loop-derived srnas or mirnas may be conserved across different species. future studies are needed to unravel the mechanisms of biogenesis and function of loop-derived srnas or mirnas.

it is commonly understood that only one strand  from the mirna duplex is incorporated into the mirisc and functional. the other strand  is degraded. however, we found that both guide and passenger strands of mir <dig> were abundant, especially in the p-deficient barley dataset. this raises the possibility that the abundant passenger strand of mir <dig> may also be incorporated into the mirisc and hence stabilized. if this is true, then it is expected that the passenger strand of mir <dig> can function as a guide strand. indeed, we detected cleavage products of the passenger strand of mir <dig> in the barley degradome library. our result fits recent data from animal systems, showing that passenger strands are incorporated into the mirisc and functional  <cit> . the passenger strand of mir <dig> may also be able to inhibit target translation. this is because we found no cleavage product in the degradome library for a predicted target  which contains a site perfectly reverse complementary to the passenger strand of mir <dig> at the 3′ untranslational region. of course, we cannot exclude the possibility that the predicted target may not be a bona fide target. further experiments are required to reveal a protein level of the target.

one of the predicted targets of mir <dig>  which encodes cytochrome p450-like protein , was observed to have an increasing transcription level in p-deficient barley where the level of mir <dig> also increased . several possibilities may explain the parallel increases in mirna and target expression levels. firstly, cytochrome p450-like tbp may not be a bona fide target of mir <dig>  however, this does not explain why its cleavage product was detected in the barley degradome library. secondly, the transcription of cytochrome p450-like tbp may be regulated by both mir <dig> and p status, but that p status is the dominant regulator, thereby resulting in a high expression level of this rna in p-deficient barley. thirdly, the cytochrome p450-like tbp may, like hvpho <dig>  be protected by an unknown mimic sequence which interacts with mir <dig>  inhibiting effective activity of the mirna. the detection of the target cleavage product may result from incomplete protection by the mimic sequence. finally, the mode of action of mir <dig> may be through inhibition of translation of the cytochrome p450-like tbp rather than cleavage of the mrna. this has been reported for other mirnas. translation inhibition may occur via prevention of the ribosome from reading the cap or proteolysis after translation of the polypeptide chain  <cit> . the regulation of mir <dig> and its target genes may be complex. similarly, in rice mir <dig> is co-expressed with its targets, osspx-mfs <dig> and osspx-mfs <dig>  in the same cells in response to p deficiency, where osspx-mfs <dig> is down-regulated and osspx-mfs <dig> is up-regulated in the plants  <cit> .

in arabidopsis, mir <dig> targets pho <dig>  which negatively regulates pi uptake and root-to-shoot allocation  <cit> . in barley we found that with increasing levels of mir <dig>  the transcript levels of hvpho <dig> decreased under p deficiency, suggesting that mir <dig> suppresses the expression of hvpho <dig>  this is consistent with some, but not all, studies of the relationship between mir <dig> and pho <dig> <cit> . however, it is not clear why the highly expressed mir <dig> target mimic, hvisp <dig>  in the same cells could not protect hvpho <dig> from mir399-mediated cleavage. in arabidopsis, over-expression of ips <dig> has been shown to increase accumulation of mrna of the mir <dig> target pho <dig> <cit> . other factors, such as hvpho2-associated srnas in barley may be involved in the degradation of hvpho <dig>  in support of this suggestion, we found that some srna species derived from hvpho <dig> were only present in the p-deficient barley dataset, but not in the p-sufficient dataset . furthermore, these srnas were all localised to or near the target sites of hvpho <dig> . we also found that a lot of antisense srnas  to hvpho <dig> were only present in the p-deficient barley dataset . the presence of hvpho2-associated srnas in p-deficient barley could substitute for mir <dig> in mediating the cleavage of hvpho <dig>  this can explain why the expression level of hvpho <dig> was reduced in the presence of high levels of hvips <dig> transcript. because hvpho <dig> contains five predicted target sites, these srnas may be triggered by mir <dig>  <cit> . however, it cannot be ruled out that part of the srna population may be derived from other genes that contain the same sequence as the target sites. several such genes have been found in the barley est databases .

previous studies showed that cleavage events triggered by mir <dig> occurred at target sites 2– <dig> in pho <dig> <cit> . in one study, the cleavage sites were predominantly at target sites  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . in another study, target sites  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were predominant  <cit> . however, our investigation of a barley degradome library only revealed cleavage sites at target sites  <dig> and  <dig>  and occurring at positions 10– <dig> relative to the 5′ end of the mirna. the cause of discrepancy between previous studies was proposed to be due to relative abundance differences of different mir <dig> members in the samples  <cit> . however, because almost all mir <dig> genes have the same sequence in the first  <dig> nt that are the key for mirna function, it is difficult to judge which mirna is responsible for cleavage at each target site, especially at positions 10– <dig> relative to the 5′ end of the mirna. on the other hand, it is unlikely that two mirna genes would cleave the same target site with equal efficiency. therefore, we presume that one cleavage site may only be cleaved by one mirna at a certain position and a certain time, and that both sequence specificity  and abundance are important for site cleavage. why has it been observed in previous studies  <cit>  that one target site is cleaved at several positions? one possibility is that the target site could be cleaved by different members of the mir <dig> family at different times, and another possibility is that some cleavage products may result from natural degradation. the third possibility is that the target site may be cleaved by sirnas rather mirnas, as discussed above. why target site  <dig>  which is perfectly matched to the abundant hvu-mir <dig>  hvu-mir399c and hvu-mir399e, is not cleaved by these or any other mir <dig> members in this and previous studies  <cit> , is not understood. it suggests that cleavage may be a complex process which relies not only on sequence specificity and abundance, but also on the nature of mirnas and/or other factors such as plant species, tissue specificity, developmental stage and/or environmental conditions.

mir <dig> and mir <dig> are not only responsive to low p, but also responsive to low nitrogen  in plants  <cit> . like p, n is also essential in plant growth and development. in arabidopsis and maize, mir <dig> and mir <dig> are down-regulated under low n conditions  <cit> . however, in soybean, the two mirnas were not detected  <cit>  although as many as  <dig> other mirnas have been detected and many of them are responsive to low n stress in this plant  <cit> . under other nutrient stresses such as sulfate starvation and high levels of fe, cu, zn, al, cd and hg in soils, the latter of which inhibit plant growth and cause toxicity to plants  <cit> , mir <dig> and mir <dig> were not found to be regulated. it is unclear how mir <dig> and mir <dig> are responsive to low n in plants. it is likely that low n affects the expression of transcription factors or co-factors that control the transcription of mir <dig> and mir <dig> genes, thereby reducing the expression of the mature mirnas  <cit> . this might be true because previous studies have identified multiple cis-elements , which are bound by a myb transcription factor, phosphate starvation response  <dig> , in the upstream sequences of all six mir <dig> genes in arabidopsis  <cit> . on the other hand, the expression of mir <dig> and mir <dig> may also be determined by other factors. in support, mir <dig> as well as many other nutrient-responsive mirnas were detected in the phloem of nutrient stressed plants  <cit> . because the phloem plays a key role in long-distance signalling for many developmental and environmental responses  <cit> , this suggests that mirnas can be remotely regulated by signals rather have to be regulated physically. from this point of view, mirnas themselves could function as a signal in systemic regulation of nutrient stress response  <cit> . this in turn suggests that the stress-regulated mirnas such as mir <dig> and mir <dig> may share a common mechanism in both expression and function. however, this hypothesis needs to be validated via experimental studies.

CONCLUSIONS
this study characterises two most p-regulated mir <dig> and mir <dig> in barley and provides their potential functional mechanisms in the relationship with p and the adaptive responses to p deficiency. the results could be used for mir399- or mir827-based engineering in the future for improvement of crop yields with limited p fertilizer.
