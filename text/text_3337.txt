BACKGROUND
water shortage constrains terrestrial ecosystem productivity considerably, mainly by limiting vegetation structure, such as species components, and their functions including growth and photosynthesis, particularly in arid and semiarid areas with large spatial-temporal variances  <cit> . drought has been and is becoming a most critical issue under climate change, with the temperature expected to increase continually, further enhancing drought severity by accelerating evapotranspiration of the ecosystems  <cit> . the grassland of north china covers 41% of the total land area of china. however, approximately 90% of the grassland nationally has degraded to various extents during recent decades due to intensified land use, e.g., overgrazing and improper reclamation, and adverse climatic change, e.g., water deficit  <cit> . water scarcity accompanying rising temperature could become an increasing environmental concern in this grassland ecosystem, leading to a reduction in productivity and negative alterations in the ecosystem structure and carbon balance, with consequent severe deterioration  <cit> .

many studies have indicated that mild drought has no obvious impact on plant growth and photosynthesis, even stimulation to a certain degree, but severe drought can lead to dramatic reductions  <cit> . whether photosynthetic capacity completely recovers after rewatering depends on the drought-resistance of different species  <cit> . most experimental results have shown that the net photosynthetic rate , stomatal conductance , and mesophyll conductance  generally decrease with decreasing water availability, and an obvious reduction in photosynthesis occurs due to severe water deficit. reduction in net co <dig> assimilation can be attributed to both stomatal and biochemical limitations, in which the proportional contribution of the latter may increase with drought severity  <cit> . parry et al.  <cit>  reported that in tobacco plants, rubisco activity, a key photosynthetic activity marker, gradually decreases with decreasing relative water content. however, in many studies, photosynthetic potentials are not significantly affected by moderate water deficit, and only under severe drought does obvious inhibition arise. dissimilarities may be related to drought treatment duration, as well as differing responses from species  <cit> .

the central parameters representing photosynthetic capacity, including light-saturated net co <dig> assimilation rate , maximum in vivo carboxylation velocity , and maximum rate of electron transport  have been used to assess the effects of global changes on the biosphere, although parameters may be altered under different growth conditions  <cit> . unfortunately, the parameterization of responses of the photosynthetic capacity to broad ranges of soil water status has received relatively scant focus to date, although a number of studies with one or a few drought intensifications have been conducted. the lack of relatively accurate parameters of environmental response curves for plant biomass and photosynthetic capacity might have substantially limited the proper application of stimulation models on plant productivity  <cit> .

many studies have suggested a simple linear relationship of plant biomass with water status or a precipitation gradient in arid/semiarid regions  <cit> . in contrast, at excessive moisture level, photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, as well as carbohydrate partitioning also might be constrained due to hypoxia in the rhizosphere  <cit> . larger rainfall events have also obviously decreased aboveground net primary production  relative to the normal rainfall pattern in a mesic grassland  <cit> . thus, the pattern that describes how photosynthetic capacity is associated with soil moisture gradient might be complex, rather than the simple linear relationship only from a few drought treatments. in this study, we determined the changes of plant growth and photosynthetic capacity as plants were subjected to soil moisture gradients . our hypothesis was that the response pattern along a soil moisture gradient might show no simple linear form, and that plant growth and photosynthesis might increase with increasing water content within an intermediate soil moisture range, but decreasing with excessive soil moisture.

RESULTS
soil moisture changes and plant water status sensitivity to soil moisture
water-withholding treatments led to a significant change in soil relative water content , and a significant linear decrease in srwc with decreased irrigation water amount , indicating water treatments can bring about a broad soil moisture gradient . with regard to leaf relative water content  versus gravimetrical water content   in the same leaves, strong positive linear correlations were found  , with a greater slope of the former, indicating a higher sensitivity in l. chinensis to soil drought.

plant growth response to soil moisture
a significant effect of soil moisture treatments on l. chinensis plant biomass was found  with significant reductions under moderate drought , severe drought , and extreme drought , based on duncan's multiple range test . the relationship of plant biomass with srwc showed an obviously typical pattern : increasing sharply with soil moisture below approximately 66% of srwc, and then leveling off when plant biomass peaked at a maximum of  <dig>  g pot- <dig>  the similar relationship between leaf biomass and srwc appeared, with a maximum of  <dig>  g pot- <dig> . soil water significantly affected s. grandis plant and leaf biomass with significant enhancement as plants were subjected to light drought , and the relationships of individual plant and leaf biomass with srwc demonstrated similar response patterns. plant and leaf biomass maxima were  <dig>  and  <dig>  g pot- <dig> at  <dig> % of srwc, indicating a lower productivity for s. grandis relative to l. chinensis under moderate soil moisture.

light-response-curve photosynthetic potentials with regard to soil moisture
the response of light-saturated net co <dig> assimilation rate  in l. chinensis leaves to soil moisture was significant based on anova  with significant decline as plants were exposed to drought stress below 50% srwc . a maximum of  <dig>  μmol mol- <dig> occurred at  <dig> % srwc with a decrease thereafter, which may represent a soil moisture optimum threshold for maximizing photosynthetic potential.

soil moisture treatments also produced significant changes in light-saturated stomatal conductance  , and extreme drought demonstrated a significant decline relative to other water treatments . a flat horizontal line on response curve of correlation between gs,sat and srwc was also observed above  <dig> % of srwc, with a gs,sat peak of  <dig>  mol mol- <dig>  additionally, under soil water treatments, significant changes in mesophyll conductance  occurred , with a pattern similar to gs,sat in response to water status . the maximum apparent quantum yield of co <dig> uptake  significantly changed under water treatments  with a significant ed-induced decline . the flat horizontal line of the response appeared at the same srwc level, with eq peaking at  <dig>  .

for s. grandis, soil water treatments led to significant changes in the three key photosynthetic potential parameters derived from the light-response curves . a similar pattern concerning the relationship between asat and srwc was obtained, with a peak asat of  <dig>  μmol mol- <dig> versus  <dig> % srwc . for the relationships between gs,sat, gm, and q with srwc, the maxima were  <dig>  mol mol- <dig>   <dig>  mol mol- <dig>  and  <dig>  at the same srwc of  <dig> % . the results also indicated s. grandis had a higher photosynthetic capacity under a proper water status.

a/ci curve photosynthetic potentials with regard to soil moisture
for l. chinensis plants, there were significant effects on maximum gross co <dig> assimilation rate  and maximum carboxylation velocity  due to the water treatments. the response curves with the flat plateaus were also obtained with ag,max and vc,max, but no significant effect of soil moisture on the maximum rate of electron transport  was observed  . overall, the maxima of ag,max, vc,max, and jmax were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  μmol mol- <dig>  respectively, within a similar srwc range, approximately  <dig> - <dig> %.

for s. grandis, the responses of ag,max and vc,max but not jmax to soil water treatments were significant  . the relationships of the former two parameters with srwc again demonstrated similar patterns to those of l. chinensis, while the relationship of jmax with srwc was weak . the maxima of the three critical parameters' responses to soil moisture were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  μmol mol- <dig>  respectively, at a srwc level of  <dig> %.

psii photochemical potentials with regard to soil moisture
changes in soil moisture resulted in significant alterations to the maximal efficiency of psii photochemistry  and efficiency of excitation energy capture by open psii reaction centers  for both grass species  with significant decreases under ed stress . generally, for l. chinensis, no significant effects of water moisture above the  <dig> % level of srwc were found in respect of fv/fm and f'v/f'm . at a level of  <dig> % srwc, the maxima for fv/fm and f'v/f'm were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. for s. grandis, analogous patterns were obtained: fv/fm peaked at  <dig>  , and f'v/f'm peaked at  <dig>   .

discussion
water scarcity is a central issue constraining productivity in most grassland ecosystems  <cit> , and can drastically affect photosynthesis at various levels, from molecular through biochemical/physiological to individual aspects  <cit> . different photosynthetic parameters can demonstrate different irregular changes in response to drought, involving interconnections and tradeoffs of great complexity, which strongly depend on the species  <cit> . in the present study, which utilized a broad range of soil water status, the responses of plant functions including growth and photosynthetic potential to soil water status, showed the patterns with photosynthetic capacity peaks at moderate soil water availability but declines under severe drought and excessive moisture, as well as differences between a perennial rhizome grass and a bunchgrass.

severe drought leads to great reduction and irreversible damage of photosynthesis, due to both diffusion limitations  and biochemical limitations , the latter becoming more critical with drought intensity  <cit> . on the other hand, excess water in soil can also result in a drastic reduction of photosynthesis  <cit> . as excessive water in soil existed, plant malfunctions, such as disturbance in hormone signals, oxidative damage, and the accumulation of toxic products of anaerobic metabolism due to anoxia in the rhizosphere, can occur  <cit> , as well as decreases in phloem transport  <cit> . together these may correlatively negatively affect photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and psii functionality.

in a larger regional geographic transect, the results of jiang and dong  <cit>  indicated that net photosynthetic rate  appears to have high points in the middle region along the northeast china transect, with an annual precipitation ranging from  <dig> mm in the east to  <dig> mm in the west. this implies the relationship between gas exchange and water availability on a large spatial scale. however, within a wide range of high precipitation  in lowland panamanian forest, leaf photosynthesis decreases rather than increases with increasing precipitation  <cit> , indicating that in the wetter region, excessive moisture may limit photosynthetic activity.

at the ecosystem or community levels, the specific relationships of grassland productivity and growth functions with water status including precipitation gradient are receiving more and more attention. on a continental scale, knapp and smith  <cit>  indicated that anpp has a strong linear relationship with annual precipitation, but there is an exceptional point of the lowest anpp with the highest precipitation at the moist alpine meadow site . while bai et al.  <cit>  reported a significant linear relationship between l. chinensis community biomass and temporal precipitation, a response curve with a flat plateau also could be obtained as reanalyzed . after further analyzing the report by wang and gao  <cit> , we also obtained a similar relationship between annual l. chinensis shoot biomass and a spatial precipitation gradient along a relatively large regional transect . according to the recent report by bai et al.  <cit> , anpp linearly increases with elevating mean annual precipitation  at both spatial and temporal scales. regarding the relationship between relative biomass and map, they  <cit>  indicated that a unimodal relationship appeared between the mean relative biomass of perennial grasses and map across different sites. however, for perennial forbs, a positive linear correlation was found, suggesting that the form of ecosystem composition shift due to the changes in map may depend on the plant functional group . by the same token, the response of grassland productivity to grazing pressures and/or unappreciated land use might also demonstrate the relationship pattern with a threshold shift. for instance, sasaki et al.  <cit>  found the evidence that the presence of a threshold in vegetation changed in response to a grazing gradient in the mongolian rangelands, indicating that the productivity of grassland can be favored under moderate grazing pressure. in contrast, a deleterious turning point appeared under an extreme high grazing level. in summary, we have obtained strong evidence confirming the hypothesis of the presence of discontinuities rather than simple linear relationships under a large range of environmental gradients  and land use intensification , from the physiologically photosynthetic leaf to ecosystem levels.

CONCLUSIONS
based on our study results and the reanalysis on other relevant reports cited above, the response curves with flat plateaus may be found often in most of the responses of plant functional capacity to an environmentally variable gradient; although the curves concerning the response pattern are not always well justified due to a few exceptional points appearing, that needs further studies in detail. species with different photosynthetic response patterns to water content can also partly explain the issues concerning the invasion of the grasslands by exotic species  <cit> . for example, those grasses with a high photosynthetic regulating ability to soil moisture, which are introduced, are always successful in regard to opportunity of invasion  <cit> , and some climatic extremes, including severe drought, may determine the ecological success of grasses with different photosynthetic pathways  <cit> . generally, the community dominated by s. grandis is more drought-resistant than that dominated by l. chinensis, and the former is often distributed in more arid areas  <cit> . in the present experiments, s. grandis was found to have lower productivity and photosynthetic potentials, but had generally similar patterns of the relationship between photosynthetic potentials and water status relative to l. chinensis. thus, the present results showing the threshold presences in photosynthetic capacity in response to a broader range of soil moisture may also provide a new insight into species component dynamics at an ecosystem level in the changing environment.
