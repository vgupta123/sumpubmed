BACKGROUND
we engineered the first respiratory saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, koy.tm6*p, by integrating the gene encoding a chimeric hexose transporter, tm6*, into the genome of an hxt null yeast  <cit> . subsequently we demonstrated the transferability of this respiratory phenotype to a yeast strain, v <dig> hxt1-7Δ, in which only hxt1- <dig> had been deleted  <cit> . the resulting v <dig> tm6*p strain produced only minor amounts of ethanol when cultured on external glucose concentrations as high as 5%  <cit> . despite the fact that the glucose flux was reduced to 30% in the v <dig> tm6*p strain compared with that of its parental v <dig> strain, the v <dig> tm6*p strain produced biomass at a specific rate as high as 85% of that produced by the v <dig> wild-type strain, the yield itself increasing by 50% in the mutant compared to its parental strain.

having performed this initial physiological characterization of the v <dig> tm6*p strain, we wanted to examine more thoroughly the basis of its respiratory phenotype by comparing its transcriptome with that of its wild-type parent strain, v <dig>  this approach has been widely used to obtain a global picture of the cellular responses of yeast to a wide range of physiological changes, including those experienced at the diauxic shift  <cit> . recently ohlmeier and colleagues  <cit>  demonstrated that major changes at the transcriptional level are not reflected at the protein level. indeed, focusing on the mitochondrial proteome following a diauxic shift, they showed that the levels of only  <dig> out of  <dig> identified proteins had changed . among them were proteins involved in the tricarboxylic acid  cycle  and the respiratory chain . this seeming disagreement with their observations of heterogeneous changes in the transcriptome  is also consistent with our own prior data where we showed that the protein patterns obtained from a 2d-page analysis of the two strains  were not substantially different  <cit> . we did note, however, that the levels of the upper-part glycolytic intermediates and atp did differ between the two strains, and that cdc <dig> is present in lower amounts in v <dig> tm6*p. this discrepancy between proteome and transcriptome regulation has also been observed by others  <cit>  and is also consistent with the fact that there is an acknowledged lack of relationship between the levels of glycolytic proteins and the glycolytic flux  <cit> . nonetheless, researchers continue to depend on mrna as an indicator of cellular state, which is a situation that will continue while methods for the global analysis of protein expression are improved  <cit> .

in this respect, brauer and colleagues  <cit>  have used transcriptome analysis to examine adjustments and remodelling of the metabolism of glucose-limited yeast cultures. in that study, the authors constructed metabolic models consistent with their cdna array data. in this work, the v <dig> tm6*p strain was therefore characterized at the transcriptome level in comparison with the parental v <dig> strain in order to obtain a more global understanding of any genetic remodelling underlying the physiological differences between them. both strains were cultured in  <dig> g/l glucose with six samples being taken at defined points between  <dig> and  <dig> g/l glucose for cdna array analysis in two independent fermentations for each strain. consequently, we generated a highly redundant dataset  where  <dig> genes were either induced or repressed when comparing v <dig> and v <dig> tm6*p under all glucose concentrations. using in vivo studies together with documented binding specificities of three transcription factors known to have a role in the regulation of respiratory genes , it was possible to correlate the up-regulation of all but  <dig> of the  <dig> genes induced by a factor ≥ <dig>  with the presence of one or more of their binding sites. this means that 75% of the transcriptional response of the genes in our dataset could be related to the activities of just three transcription factors, which in turn would account for 88% of the response of the induced set. finally, we made the unexpected observation that both the induction and repression of many of the genes in our dataset had a clear glucose dependence in the parent v <dig> strain that was not present in v <dig> tm6*p. this important result indicates that the relief of glucose repression in the wild-type is already operable at much higher glucose concentrations than is currently widely accepted and that the phenotype of the respiratory strain is glucose insensitive by comparison.

RESULTS
we compared the transcriptional profiles of the v <dig> and v <dig> tm6*p strains cultured in  <dig> g/l glucose, with samples extracted between  <dig> and  <dig> g/l residual glucose. we identified  <dig> genes with adjusted p-values <  <dig>  that changed their expression levels either up by a factor of ≥ <dig>   or down by a factor of ≤ <dig>   when comparing the two strains at all three sampling points. these genes are presented by functional category of their gene products in additional file  <dig> and are discussed below. additional file  <dig> provides the information in excel format and also includes other relevant literature data. a further  <dig> genes changed their expression levels either up by a factor of < <dig>   or down by a factor >  <dig>   and are presented as part of additional file  <dig>  the remaining  <dig> genes were either dubious, ty-transposable elements, or were detected due to cross-hybridisation, as indicated in the legend to additional file  <dig> 

the majority of genes that have an altered expression in v <dig> tm6*p compared with its parental strain also have an altered expression following diauxic shift
we compared our dataset with three sets of expression data for yeast undergoing a diauxic shift, where the samples had been taken at least  <dig> hours after the glucose is depleted  <cit> . of the  <dig> genes in our dataset that changed their expression levels either up or down by a factor of  <dig> or more,  <dig> of these could be identified as changing in the same direction in at least one of these three datasets, with  <dig> having at least two matches. only  <dig> genes  had changes that were in the opposite direction in at least two of the datasets. this significant overlap between our data set and the data sets of the three previous studies is entirely consistent with the fact that there is a transition from a respiro-fermentative metabolism in v <dig> to a respiratory metabolism in v <dig> tm6*p.

glycolytic and gluconeogenic genes have substantially altered expression levels in v <dig> tm6*p
four of the most strongly induced genes in additional file  <dig> are the glycolytic genes, hxk <dig>  and glk <dig> , and the gluconeogenic genes, pck <dig>  and fbp <dig> . indeed, as shown in figure  <dig>  the induction in v <dig> tm6*p of several glycolytic and gluconeogenic genes could be consistent with these cells accommodating for a lack of glucose; the hypothesized mechanism behind the strain's reduced ethanol-producing, respiratory phenotype. the final step in glycolysis which produces pyruvate, is catalyzed by pyruvate kinase. in v <dig> tm6*p the pyruvate kinase genes, cdc <dig> and pyk <dig>  respond in an opposing manner: cdc <dig> is repressed by a factor of  <dig>   while pyk <dig> is induced and is relieved of its glucose-repressed state as a result of the low glucose flux in the respiratory strain. reduced ethanol production in v <dig> tm6*p compared to the parental strain is also consistent with the two most strongly repressed genes pdc <dig>  and pdc <dig>  encoding the main pyruvate decarboxylases.

alternative carbon source usage genes are induced in v <dig> tm6*p compared with v <dig>  consistent with a reduced glucose flux
an adaptation to enable growth on alternative carbon sources is seen in the induction of the plasma membrane transporter genes mal <dig> and stl <dig> as well as the genes suc <dig>  gut <dig>  gut <dig>  ald <dig> and bdh <dig> encoding proteins for the utilization of sucrose, glycerol, acetaldehyde and butanediol, respectively. gut <dig> in particular is strongly induced by a factor of  <dig> , and stl <dig> is the most strongly induced of all genes on the cdna array , suggesting that v <dig> tm6* has undergone a substantial genetic adjustment compared to its parent. furthermore, cyb <dig>  and dld <dig> , whose gene products are involved in the conversion of lactate to pyruvate, and in the case of cyb <dig> feeding the released electrons into the electron transport chain, are oppositely regulated. biochemical data and sequence patterns for ygl157w   <cit> , yal061w  and dsf <dig>  suggest that these orfs encode an oxidoreductase, a polyol dehydrogenase and a putative sugar dehydrogenase, respectively, which could be involved in channelling alternative carbon sources into the tca cycle. the carbon-deficient state of v <dig> tm6*p  <cit>  could also be consistent with the induction of crc <dig> and cat <dig> whose gene products are involved in β-oxidation and carnitine-dependent transport of acetyl-coa from peroxisomes to mitochondria as a way of using carbon from sources other than glucose  <cit> . the induction of sfc <dig>  jen <dig>  fbp <dig> and ato <dig> seen in our study has previously been reported to be a specific identifier of carbon-limited growth  <cit> .

all tca- and glyoxylate cycle genes have increased expression in v <dig> tm6*p compared with v5
the genes encoding the enzymes of the tca cycle  all have a significant  increase in expression when comparing v <dig> and v <dig> tm6*p. in addition, the gene encoding an isoform of aconitase  has its expression level reduced by a factor of  <dig> . fermentation is almost completely abolished in the v <dig> tm6*p strain, and we have previously shown that the tca cycle has a higher carbon flux  <cit>  to harness the electron flow into the respiratory chain and generate a proton gradient using f0f1-atpase for atp synthesis . interestingly, all genes of the tca-cycle are induced by greater than a factor of  <dig>  except for cit1/cit <dig> and kgd1/kgd <dig> where the factor change is  <dig>  –  <dig>  for each gene of the pair, presumably yielding the same overall transcriptional response. consistent with this, ohlmeier and colleagues have shown that sdh <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> all have increased expression after a diauxic shift  <cit> .

the glyoxylate cycle is anabolic, yielding gluconeogenic precursors, and all its genes , mls <dig> and mdh2) are induced in v <dig> tm6*p compared with v <dig> . this could be consistent with the correspondingly increased biomass yield of the v <dig> tm6*p strain . we note that v <dig> tm6*p has a lower biomass yield than expected from a totally respiratory phenotype. in chemostat culture under aerobic, fully respiratory conditions, a yield of  <dig>  g/g is typical at low dilution rates, whereas the observed low yield in v <dig> tm6*p has already been published using a range of sugars and concentrations  <cit> . furthermore, numerous experiments on koy.tm6*p, our original respiratory strain based on cen.pk2-1c,  <cit>  have yielded identical results. these observations are in agreement with our findings in table  <dig> of  <dig>  g/g in v <dig> tm6*p and  <dig>  g/g in v <dig> from batch cultures.

yields were calculated as g product /g of glucose consumed/catabolised for v <dig> and v <dig> tm6*p, cultured as described in 'materials and methods'. the numbers in parentheses are the standard error of the mean, together with the number of replicates  for each experiment. the seemingly low biomass yield for v <dig> was measured after consumption of all glucose. yield increases as all ethanol and glycerol are consumed during subsequent respiratory growth.

genes encoding respiratory chain enzymes are induced in v <dig> tm6*p compared with v5
 <dig> key genes encoding mitochondrial enzymes involved in respiration – as well as f0f1-atpase and its chaperones – are all induced by a factor of  <dig> –  <dig> in v <dig> tm6*p . the gene encoding ndi <dig> , which transfers electrons from nadh to ubiquinone  is induced the most , while all other components of the respiratory chain are induced by a factor of  <dig> –  <dig> . genes encoding heme synthesis and incorporation , complex assembly  and heme degradation  are also induced by a factor of  <dig> –  <dig> . cytochrome c oxidase also has different chaperones that are induced to form an active structure by proteolysis , as well as delivery of copper . in spite of the higher respiratory rate in v <dig> tm6*p, several genes involved in detoxification of oxygen radicals are repressed, e.g. genes encoding peroxiredoxin  and thioredoxin  are repressed by a factor of  <dig>  –  <dig> . conversely, the capacity for nitrous oxide detoxification is increased by the induction of yhb <dig> by a factor of  <dig> . it is possible that the respiratory phenotype of v <dig> tm6*p could induce a higher level of oxygen radical formation inside its mitochondria and thus oxidation of guanine could occur on the mitochondrial dna. such detrimental effects could be counteracted, via the observed induction of ogg <dig> by a factor of  <dig> .

changes of expression in genes encoding mitochondrial and plasma membrane transporters are consistent with a respiratory phenotype in v <dig> tm6*p
the genes encoding the hexose transporters, hxt <dig> to hxt <dig>  have very high sequence identities  <cit>  and thus cross reactivity between them is expected on the array. this explains the observed signal for hxt <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which have been deleted in v <dig> tm6*p. hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> are known to be repressed by high levels of glucose and are consequently induced as expected in v <dig> tm6*p. a carbon source deficiency triggers an up-regulation of genes encoding plasma membrane proteins responsible for the import of alternative carbon sources, as already noted: stl <dig> ; jen <dig> , put <dig>  and mal <dig> . a gene associated with nutrient deficiency in yeast  <cit> , ygp <dig>  is induced by a factor of  <dig> , again supporting the notion that v <dig> tm6*p has undergone a genetic adjustment compared to its parent.

it seems that v <dig> tm6*p also has an altered requirement for metal ions in that genes encoding three metal ion channels have altered expression: ctr <dig>  is induced by a factor of  <dig> , while zrt <dig>  and enb <dig>  are repressed by a factor of  <dig>  –  <dig> . it is likely that copper import is increased so that copper can be transferred to cytochrome c oxidase, which is the main copper-requiring enzyme in additional file  <dig>  with  <dig> copper ions per complex and a copy number of  <dig> – <dig>  per cell. there are only  <dig> genes in additional file  <dig> with greater than  <dig>  copies per cell and none of these has copper as a prosthetic group except cytochrome c oxidase.

the amino acid uptake systems encoded by bap <dig> and gnp <dig> are repressed while the proline permease encoded by put <dig> is induced. put <dig> has a carbon source responsive element   <cit>  that is expected to be induced at the low glucose flux experienced in the v <dig> tm6*p strain, while bap <dig> and gnp <dig> are regulated by a sensor of extracellular amino acid concentration, where ssy <dig>  <cit>  is a vital component. it is likely that in v <dig> tm6*p the repression of bap <dig> and gnp <dig> is a result of the repression  of ssy <dig> seen on the cdna array. interestingly, induction of genes encoding the ammonia transport system in the v <dig> tm6*p strain  could suggest that the strain is experiencing general nutrient limitation. it has previously been reported for example that the induction of another mep family member, mep <dig>  is associated with nitrogen limitation  <cit> .

88% of genes induced in v <dig> tm6*p compared to its parent have transcription factor binding sites for one or more of the hap complex, cat <dig> or mig1
genome-wide studies have yielded a wealth of information on which promoters are bound by different transcription factors  <cit> . in order to rationalise these resources, we began by looking for biologically-verified data on transcription factors that might control the repression of the subset of  <dig> genes of additional file  <dig>  since only limited information was publicly available, we did not pursue this part of the dataset further. in contrast, for the  <dig> induced genes in additional file  <dig>  our observation of the similarity between the transcriptional changes in the v <dig> to v <dig> tm6*p transition and those in the transition from glucose to ethanol growth lead us to analyse the roles of hap <dig>  cat <dig> and mig <dig> which have been previously been verified to be crucial to the expression of genes in the diauxic shift  <cit> : hap <dig>   <cit>  and cat <dig>   <cit>  are transcriptional activators, whereas mig <dig>  is a transcriptional repressor that works in concert with tup1-cyc <dig>  <cit> .

the hap complex is comprised of proteins hap <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and has separate subunits for dna binding and transcriptional activation. dna binding is mediated by hap <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  while hap <dig> functions as an activation domain. the expression of hap <dig> is repressed by glucose and is responsible for regulation of hap complex target genes. we began by scrutinising data for a hap <dig> over-expression strain, in which  <dig> genes had their expression affected by at least a factor of  <dig>  <cit> , which is  <dig> % of the genome.  <dig> of these genes were found in our dataset and are listed in table  <dig>  only three of these  are down-regulated in the hap <dig> over-expression strain, whereas glk <dig> and ctr <dig> are induced in the v <dig> tm6*p strain. interestingly, a typical hap complex binding site was not seen in the  <dig> nucleotide region upstream of the glk <dig>  ctr <dig> and zrt <dig> start codon  while all other genes in table  <dig> except agx <dig>  mnp <dig> and ynk <dig> were found to have at least one hap complex binding site. these hap complex-binding-site-containing genes comprise a significant subset  with a verified biological dependence on hap <dig> activation. clearly, then, hap <dig> has a statistically-significant role to play in the metabolism of v <dig> tm6*p as there is an association between hap <dig> dependence and our dataset .

genes were tabulated and sorted according to their roles in yeast cellular physiology, as described in the legend for additional file  <dig>  note that the seven hexose transporter genes, hxt1- <dig>  are deleted in the v <dig> tm6*p with the amino-terminal half of hxt <dig> and the carboxy-terminal half of hxt <dig> reincorporated as the tm6* chimera. in the 'factor change' column, change is expressed as a factor, where that factor is x when a gene expressed with intensity '1' in v <dig> is expressed with intensity 'x' in v <dig> tm6*p. all t-tests were jointly adjusted for multiple testing using the false discovery rate method : p-values were adjusted so that when selecting all genes with p-values less than a threshold q, a proportion of q false positives would be expected amongst these genes. the genes shown have p-values <  <dig> , and thus the expected false discovery rate is 5%. the factor in the final column is taken from lascaris et al  <cit> . †note that due to overall high homology within the hexose transporter family, changes were still observed on the cdna array for hxt <dig>  even though it is deleted as already mentioned.

since six of the genes from the hap <dig> over-expression study did not contain hap complex binding sites, we did a further in silico analysis of the induced genes of additional file  <dig>  we noted that the genes of table  <dig>  contained motifs that could be sub-divided into  <dig> distinct families: ccaatg  and caacaa . the bold sequences are the conserved sequences previously identified in the hap <dig> over-expression strain study  <cit> . the genes of additional file  <dig> were then examined  <dig> nucleotides upstream and  <dig> nucleotides downstream from the start codon using webmotif  <cit>  for these two biologically-relevant sites since it has been previously demonstrated that hap complex binding sites are statistically over-represented up to  <dig> nucleotides upstream from the start codon  <cit> : we found that 112/ <dig>  induced genes and 127/ <dig>  of the complete dataset in additional file  <dig> had one or more hap complex binding site . our analysis included presumed binding sites such as caaatc and ccaaac which arose from the biologically-verified data on transcription factors . for example, aqy <dig> is identified as hap complex-dependent, and has two ccaaac sites, but no ccaatna sites. there are only two other genes that do not contain ccaatna sites in table  <dig>  namely crc <dig> and ald <dig>  in addition it was notable that hap complex consensus sequences are predominantly found upstream of mitochondrial genes with 84/ <dig>  of such genes having at least a partial mitochondrial location. furthermore, of the induced genes with a known cellular location and at least two hap complex binding sites, 69/ <dig>  are localized to the mitochondria. it appears, then, that hap <dig> activation is preferentially directed at mitochondrially-related functions especially within the tca-cycle and respiratory chain, but cytosolic support via the glyoxylate cycle is also potentially regulated by hap <dig> activation . it was further noted that multiple hap complex binding sites are associated with induction . a fisher's exact test showed that there was a statistically-significant association between the change in gene expression and the number of hap complex binding sites in the gene . this supported the fact that genes with two or more hap complex binding sites are likely to be induced, whereas those with one site may be either induced or repressed.

in order to adopt a similar approach for cat <dig>  we examined available biological data for cat <dig> and adr <dig>  from chromatin immunoprecipitations  <cit> , and mrna expression ratios in wt/Δcat <dig> strains  <cit> . we identified  <dig> genes out of  <dig> from these studies that were also in our dataset . only ato <dig> was oppositely regulated when comparing our dataset. for all other genes, the change in expression followed the same trend of up-regulation . as for the hap <dig> analysis, we examined these  <dig> genes for cat <dig> binding sites, and identified a typical cat <dig> motif  <cit>  in  <dig> of them, nine being of the cat8-sip <dig> type, tccattsrtccgr . the remaining six induced genes  were further scrutinised, and it was apparent that all except odc <dig> had been identified from immunoprecipitation data for adr <dig> alone, consistent with their lack of cat8-sip <dig> motif. the induced genes of additional file  <dig> were therefore searched from the start codon to  <dig>  nucleotides upstream for the generic cat <dig> motif, cc------ccg motif giving  <dig> genes . the non-coding intergenic regions of these genes were then searched using webmotif  <cit>  and hxk <dig>  cox <dig>  odc <dig>  om <dig>  om <dig> and yor019w were found to share the consensus sequence gccsstss)cms in common with idp <dig> and are thus also listed in additional file  <dig>  we noted that genes with these cat <dig> binding sites are induced in v <dig> tm6*p by an average factor of  <dig>  while the average for induced genes in additional file  <dig> is  <dig> . the highly-induced, cat8-site-containing genes include hxk <dig> , pck <dig> , stl <dig> , jen <dig> , odc <dig>  and sfc <dig> .

the table is arranged as for table  <dig>  factor changes denoted 'a' are from additional file  <dig>  'b' refer to chromatin immunoprecipitation data for cat <dig>  <cit> , 'c' refer to mrna expression ratios for wt/Δcat <dig>  <cit>  and 'd' refer to chromatin immunoprecipitation data for adr <dig>  <cit> .

we observed that some strongly-induced genes in additional file  <dig> did not have hap complex or cat <dig> binding sites. indeed, the expression of many genes such as suc <dig> is already known to be repressed by both mig <dig> and mig <dig> in glucose media, although mig <dig> is the main factor in this response  <cit> . we therefore examined biological data on gene expression in Δmig <dig> and Δmig <dig> strains  <cit> . in these studies,  <dig> genes were presented as being mig dependent, of which  <dig> were found in additional file  <dig>  and  <dig> in additional file  <dig> . we then examined protein binding microarray data  <cit>  and tabulated the combined outputs as table  <dig>  which lists  <dig> mig-dependent genes. when searching the induced set in additional file  <dig> in silico for genes containing mig <dig> binding sites,  <dig> were identified, predominantly containing consensus sequences of the suc2b type , but also in some cases sites that were more homologous to suc2a at  <cit> ). we noted that the presence of a mig <dig> site in a gene correlated with high induction  and that overall, our analysis provides a highly complete description of how three transcriptions factors might regulate the  <dig> induced genes of additional file  <dig> .

the table is arranged as for table  <dig>  factor changes denoted 'a' are from additional file  <dig>  mig <dig> binding was verified using data from protein-binding microarray  <cit>  studies denoted 'b' and in vivo  <cit>  analyses denoted 'c' although no factor changes were indicated in those studies.

we noted that hap <dig>  is induced and cat <dig> , mig <dig>  and mig <dig>  are down-regulated in v <dig> tm6*p compared to v <dig>  in our dataset, the specific change in array signal for mig <dig> had an adjusted p-value >  <dig>  over the complete experimental range. the result for cat <dig> was unexpected as it contains an upstream mig <dig> binding site similar to hap <dig>  and cat <dig> target genes such as fbp <dig> and pck <dig> are themselves induced. it is possible that the transcript was not probed accurately on the array either due to cross-hybridisation between closely related dna sequences or on account of its low base expression value . a future real time q-pcr experiment would probe the individual transcript.

transcripts dependent on external glucose concentration are not found in the respiratory v <dig> tm6*p strain, even though several glucose- or carbon-source-associated transcripts are glucose dependent in the parental wild-type strain
the transcriptome of the respiratory v <dig> tm6*p strain was not found to be responsive to changes in glucose concentration in the culture medium. however, in the wild-type parent strain  the transcriptome was found to vary with glucose availability according to a least squares fit of the logarithmic array values for rna extracted at the six different glucose concentrations. this dependence on external glucose concentrations is seen in the v <dig> strain for  <dig> genes  with an adjusted p-value <  <dig>  . the genes with the strongest dependence on external glucose concentrations were found to be hxk <dig>  rgs <dig>  adh <dig>  cha <dig> and glk <dig> . the sugar kinases hxk <dig> and glk <dig> are induced as expected as they have their maximal expression during growth on other carbon sources  <cit> . the gene product of rgs <dig> inhibits gpa <dig> in the pka pathway, which is one of the pathways induced by glucose  <cit> . adh <dig> appears to be induced on carbon sources other than glucose  <cit> . in a study by derisi and colleagues, batch yeast cultures were harvested for cdna array analysis at gradually decreasing glucose concentration  <cit> . our examination of the supplementary data provided by the authors showed that as glucose was consumed between  <dig>  and  <dig>  g/l, three of the genes in figure  <dig>  were found in the top  <dig> genes with a changed expression from that study. overall, the results in figure  <dig> show that glucose repression is gradually relieved on going from  <dig> g/l to  <dig> g/l glucose. furthermore relief of repression is already apparent at a surprisingly high glucose concentration, in contrast to the assumption that it is typically triggered over a range of low glucose concentrations  <cit> , the trigger being very low for some genes  <cit> .

in order to examine whether the glucose dependence of genes in v <dig> affected our data in additional file  <dig>  we excluded the data points at  <dig>  and  <dig>  g/l glucose for v <dig> tm6*p, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  g/l glucose for v <dig>  and compared the cdna array data in this case with each other exactly as for the full data set. following this procedure, only a small subset of genes that are highly induced had their factor changes increased substantially, but this did not affect the fact that they remain within the top  <dig> most induced genes in additional file  <dig>  they are hxk <dig> ; stl <dig> ; dsf <dig> ; cyb <dig>  and fbp <dig> . fourteen of the seventeen genes that were most affected by this recalculation were found to contain a mig <dig> binding site. it is therefore possible that mig <dig> is also involved in relieving glucose repression in the  <dig> to  <dig> g/l range, and not only at the depletion of glucose at the diauxic shift. overall, we found that the amplitudes of the factor changes varied by only  <dig> % in this new calculation compared with the original one, which indicated that the glucose dependence of the v <dig> strain does not have a major influence on the way we generated the data presented in additional file  <dig> 

discussion
the main physiological change in both the diauxic shift and the transition from a respiro-fermentative to a respiratory metabolism is that glycolysis is channelled to support respiration: this occurs upon glucose depletion during the diauxic shift and throughout the growth curve in glucose medium in v <dig> tm6*p. although previously-published genomic analyses of yeast's response to the diauxic shift transition have all been sampled under different conditions – rich  medium with 2% glucose  <cit> , minimal defined medium in chemostat cultures at different dilution rates  <cit> , and minimal defined media in batch cultures sampled  <dig> h after the diauxic shift  <cit>  – common themes emerge with changes on going from v <dig> to v <dig> tm6*p. overall 81% of genes which are induced or repressed on going from v <dig> to v <dig> tm6*p in our study were found in at least one of these three datasets for the diauxic shift. furthermore, we also find that for all proteins induced in a study of the diauxic shift by 2d-gel electrophoresis  <cit> , the corresponding genes are induced on going from v <dig> to v <dig> tm6*p except for the alcohol dehydrogenase, adh <dig>  there is a hence close agreement between induction of the following genes and the levels of the corresponding proteins: fbp <dig>  icl <dig>  pck <dig>  idp <dig>  mls <dig>  dld <dig>  ald <dig>  sdh <dig> and cit <dig>  this strong correlation with previously-published data and our own observed correlation of data for cdc <dig> and cdc <dig> supports the phenotypic similarity between the v <dig> to v <dig> tm6*p transition and the diauxic shift. it is worth noting that there is no clear correlation of our data in additional file  <dig> with any possible differences in growth rate between the two strains. in a study by regenberg and colleagues  <cit> ,  <dig> genes changed in expression by more than a factor of  <dig> when comparing growth rates. of these  <dig>  3% of all genes are found in additional file  <dig> providing no significant overlap in data.

it is also possible to see parallels between our data set and a study of nitrogen deprivation and stationary phase growth for wild-type yeast by gasch and colleagues  <cit> . this is supported by the fact that ten of the  <dig> genes that were found to be strongly induced upon nitrogen deprivation and growth in stationary phase in that study are also induced in the v <dig> to v <dig> tm6*p transition. only two genes, ygr067c  and ecm <dig>  are not induced in the v <dig> tm6*p strain, but were highly induced in the gasch study  <cit>  upon nitrogen deprivation and stationary phase growth. in addition, we find that the genes encoding mep <dig> and ato <dig>  which are involved in ammonia transport are also strongly induced in v <dig> tm6*p in our study. such an induction is seen in both the diauxic shift studies performed in defined media  <cit> , but not in rich medium  <cit> , suggestive of nutrient limitation. in fact, v <dig> tm6*p also appears carbon limited, not least as a result of the fact that amongst the most strongly induced genes are fbp <dig> and pck <dig>  which encode gluconeogenic enzymes. stl <dig>  mal <dig> and suc <dig>  are induced in v <dig> tm6*p, also consistent with its low glycolytic flux and suggestive of an adaptation of metabolism  as seen by brauer and colleagues  <cit>  and supported by our previous work  <cit> . several of these genes including fbp <dig> and stl <dig>  as well as jen <dig>  odc <dig>  sfc <dig> and ato <dig> have already been identified as being either induced under carbon limitation or being specific indicators of carbon limitation in yeast cultures  <cit> , consistent with our own data.

the analysis of transcription factor binding sites present in the genes of additional file  <dig> revealed that  <dig> genes had hap complex binding sites, the majority of which encode mitochondrial proteins. of genes that only had hap complex binding sites present, thirteen had only one and of these only five were induced leading us to hypothesise that multiple hap complex binding sites are correlated with induction of the additional file  <dig> genes . interestingly, in a microarray screen of a hap1Δ mutant for hap1-dependent genes  <cit> , 7/ <dig> genes that were induced in the hap1Δ mutant are also induced in additional file  <dig> , and in each case also have a hap complex binding site. in addition,  <dig> genes containing a cat <dig> site and  <dig> genes containing a mig <dig> site were predicted, with many of these genes being experimentally-verified in previous in vivo studies. our analysis of the regulation of 88% of the induced genes of our unique respiratory strain  is further supported by a novel computational method  <cit>  that predicts the hap complex and mig <dig> control the genes of additional file 1; cat <dig> is not included in that database.

a quite unexpected result from comparing the transcriptional profiles of v <dig> with v <dig> tm6*p is the data set in figure  <dig>  showing genes from the parent strain that are clearly glucose dependent and that the glucose dependence observed begins at concentrations  higher than the range generally regarded as the glucose-repressed region. strain dby <dig>  <cit> , which is unrelated to v <dig>  previously showed a gradual relief of glucose repression starting at  <dig> g/l glucose for glk <dig>  hxk <dig> and fal <dig>  these results for v <dig> and dby <dig> suggest that gradual relief is a general s. cerevisiae phenomenon. future studies will show whether the gradient of the slope is different for different strains. that such glucose dependence requires an intact glucose uptake system is suggested by the fact that it is not seen in the v <dig> tm6*p strain: the array signal is not changed significantly for any of the genes in the v <dig> tm6*p strain at the different glucose concentrations sampled. this implies that in v <dig> tm6*p, glucose sensing is independent of external glucose concentration. the wild-type yeast, on the other hand, shows an extensive modulation of its expression profile at high glucose concentrations despite the fact that its physiological response is largely unaffected. the insensitivity of the v <dig> tm6*p strain therefore makes it an extremely valuable biotechnological tool as it can be cultured in a wide range of external glucose concentrations, whilst maintaining the same respiratory phenotype  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have been able to characterize the transcriptome of a unique respiratory yeast strain. we have been able to identify highly complete collections of known genes in the tca cycle, glyoxylate cycle and respiratory chain that are consistent with a respiratory metabolism. our results suggest that there has been genetic remodelling predominantly through the activity of hap <dig>  cat <dig> and mig <dig>  and that the gene expression profile of v <dig> tm6*p during growth on glucose resembles wild-type s. cerevisiae cells in the diauxic shift.
