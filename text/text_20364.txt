BACKGROUND
molluscs are the second largest animal phylum, comprising about 7% of living animals and occupying habitats ranging from high alpine regions to deep sea vents, with a diverse range of lifestyles including predatory, scavenging, herbivorous, detritivorous and filter-feeding  <cit> . the most abundant class of mollusc are the gastropods, which include the land snails that have evolved independently to life on land. such a transition has required adaptations towards water saving and breathing dry air.

the central nervous system , hepatopancreas  and foot muscle are all key organs controlling or having some influence on a snail’s metabolic rate, whereby a diverse array of cellular modifications is necessary to regulate and co-ordinate changes at the organismal level. many of these modifications need to be global, and tightly controlled. such wide ranging control is typically achieved by chemical signalling using neurohormones, many of which are peptides  <cit> . neuropeptides, which occur in all animals with a nervous system  <cit> , have been widely studied since the early 1950’s when oxytocin and vasopressin neuropeptides were first identified and characterised  <cit> . many neuropeptides derive from larger inactive precursors which are proteolytically cleaved into a number of smaller bioactive neuropeptides, generally all the same, but occasionally with different biological actions  <cit> .

in molluscs, most neuropeptide research has been on the aquatic gastropods, aplysia, lymnaea and lottia. in the marine gastropod, aplysia, several neuropeptides have been well described that are involved with reproduction and learning  <cit> . in a. californica, the best known neuropeptide is fmrf-amide, which appears to provide physiological control of gills  <cit> , and has also been found in heart tissue  <cit> , along with the small cardioactive peptides  which increase heart rate and the amplitude of the beat  <cit> . the freshwater snail l. stagnalis has also been a model for mollusc neuropeptide research where studies have discovered five genes coding for the neuropeptides apgwamide, neuropeptide y, conopressin, molluscan insulin-related peptide, and pedal peptide that are involved in muscle contraction and modulation in males  <cit> . in silico genome and transcriptome database mining have proven effective for high-throughput annotation of the presence and expression of neuropeptides in lottia, as well as in bivalve oysters  <cit> . less is known about the neuropeptide repertoire of terrestrial pulmonate gastropods, although recently, mass spectrometry has been used to identify and determine changes in neuropeptide profiles in the brain and haemolymph of the snail helix pomatia during activity versus hibernation  <cit> . in that study,  <dig> neuropeptides were identified as being more highly produced within the brain of active snails. meanwhile, during hibernation,  <dig> neuropeptides were exclusively present  <cit> .

in the current study, we investigated the cns, hepatopancreas and foot muscle transcriptomes of the land snail theba pisana through gene and peptide analysis. we found numerous neuropeptide precursors that show similarity with other known molluscan neuropeptide precursors, and also demonstrate the existence of numerous other genes that encode peptides destined for secretion. this represents the most extensive analysis of neuropeptide genes and their products in a terrestrial snail.

RESULTS
de novo assembly and comparison of theba cns, foot and hepatopancreas
transcript libraries derived from t. pisana cns, foot and hepatopancreas tissues were sequenced using illumina technologies and assembled. all sequence data was deposited in the ncbi genbank under sra file srp <dig>  a summary of the number of high quality raw reads, contigs and unigenes for each tissue is shown in figure  <dig>  the cns, foot and hepatopancreas transcriptomes encoded  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  unigenes, respectively. a unigene is typically interpreted as representing a single genomic locus; hence, these groups represent the first comprehensive non-redundant putative transcript database for t. pisana. collectively, contigs and unigenes could be assembled into a total of  <dig>  consensus sequences ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp; size distribution for the pooled tissue transcriptome is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  approximately  <dig>  representative sequences are shared within the three transcriptomes . although cns has more unique unigenes compared to foot or hepatopancreas, there was no substantial difference based on protein functional domain annotation . in total, there were  <dig>  cns proteins,  <dig>  foot proteins and  <dig>  hepatopancreas proteins annotated, with  <dig> unique pfam domains. combining the unigene and pfam comparison results, the data revealed that the three tissues have a moderate number of tissue-specific transcripts that encode proteins that play similar functions in cellular processes.figure  <dig> summary of transcriptome and annotation of genes from theba pisana cns, hepatopancreas and foot muscle. figure shows the cns, including regions of cerebral ganglia , cerebral commissure , mesocerebrum , procerebrum , metacerebrum  and pedal ganglia . venn diagrams show comparisons of representative sequences and protein domain annotation between each tissue transcriptome.



functional annotation
t. pisana sequences were annotated against protein databases  using blastx . from the  <dig>  consensus sequences,  <dig>   had at least one hit. the sequence names and annotation information of all sequences are provided in additional file 2: table s <dig>  the majority of transcripts had either a significant match with those from the pacific oyster  or did not match to any known genes; this result is most likely due to insufficient sequences being available in public databases from phylogenetically closely related species. the annotation rate in our study is comparable to those that have been reported in previous de novo transcriptome sequencing studies for molluscs  <cit> .

gene ontology was performed to classify functions to t. pisana genes . of these,  <dig>  transcripts were assigned to functional categories of ‘biological process’ ,  <dig>  to ‘molecular function’  and  <dig>  to ‘cellular component’ . functional annotation of all transcripts combined against the cluster of orthologous groups  database is shown in figure 2b. these were assigned to four primary cog classes: information storage and processing , cellular processes and signalling , and metabolism  as well as poorly characterized genes . the cog functional classification demonstrates that the most abundant classification is “general function prediction only”, followed by “translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis” and “transcription”.figure  <dig> predicted functional analysis.  analysis of gene ontology to classify functions to t. pisana genes  graph showing the assignment of the t. pisana unigenes to categories of the eukaryotic cluster of orthologous groups of proteins . the main cog categories  are represented with different colours.



transcript abundance was determined based on fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped . in the cns, of the  <dig> most abundant transcripts , 22% encoded for neuropeptides such as insulin, neuropeptide y, myomodulin and achatin, whereas unannotated transcripts comprised 40% of transcripts. in the hepatopancreas, many of the top  <dig> abundant transcripts  encoded for catabolic enzymes including cathepsin peptidase, serine peptidase, chitotriosidase- <dig>  myosinase, lysozyme, while 20% were unannotated including the most abundant transcript . in the foot muscle, the epiphragmin-encoding transcripts were most prominent. common transcripts that were of high abundance in all three transcriptomes included those encoding a polyubiquitin protein, heat shock protein  <dig> and an elongation factor  <dig> alpha.

annotation of mollusc proteins secreted from cns in theba pisana
investigation of the t. pisana cns transcriptome, including identification of those precursors containing signal peptides and no transmembrane domains, revealed that theba might contain as many as  <dig> precursor proteins that are destined to secrete peptides . of those,  <dig> putative proteins are expressed in all three transcriptomes . another  <dig> were expressed in both cns and foot, while there appeared to be no overlap in expression between cns and hepatopancreas. the remaining  <dig> proteins were expressed exclusively in cns. on the basis of a fold change higher than  <dig>  we defined a list of  <dig> putative secreted proteins in cns. as shown in figure 3b, the expression fpkm for the majority of the putative secreted peptides were less than  <dig>  of those where expression was > <dig> and 10– <dig>  81% and 22% are designated as encoding hypothetical proteins, respectively .figure  <dig> distribution and level of gene expression, based on fpkm.  relative distribution of cns predicted secreted proteins.  relative expression level of secreted protein transcripts in the cns.



of the putative secreted proteins in the cns, full-length precursors were identified in t. pisana for  <dig> known molluscan neuropeptides , including isoforms and insulin that in molluscs can be secreted from neural tissue. in figure  <dig>  a “white” cell is defined as indicating only a trace amount or no transcript . in general, for these neuropeptide transcripts, abundance was most prominent within neural tissue, particularly for insulin <dig>  npy, myomodulin <dig> and achatin .figure  <dig> summary of molluscan neuropeptides, their distribution and characteristics identified in theba pisana.



full-length precursors for some of these neuropeptides were also found to be of intermediate abundance in foot muscle while absent from the hepatopancreas. peptide extraction followed by lc-ms analysis was used to confirm the usefulness of transcriptome-derived protein libraries and complement in silico neuropeptide predictions . figure  <dig> shows the organisation of t. pisana neuropeptide precursors compared with previously identified homolog precursors of a marine gastropod, the limpet lottia gigantea, with general high conservation in the spatial organisation of bioactive peptide sequences, as well as precursor size, cleavage sites and position of cysteine residues. several of these neuropeptides were targeted for more in-depth tissue expression analysis.figure  <dig> schematic representation showing organisation of theba pisana and lottia gigantea neuropeptides. yellow, signal peptide; blue, bioactive peptides; c, cysteine. scale bars at bottom show length in amino acids .



the tpi-allatostatin c precursor comprised  <dig> amino acids, including signal peptide and cleavage sites to release the  <dig> amino acid active allatostatin c located in the c-terminal region of the precursor . most similarity with allatostatin c from other species was found within the bioactive peptide, primarily at the n-terminal sh and spatial conservation of two cysteine residues that likely form disulfide bonds to help stabilise the peptide. tpi-allatostatin c was only identified in the cns transcriptome, at a low expression level  but rt-pcr analysis showed that it was expressed not only in cerebral and pleural ganglia but also in t. pisana digestive tract and skin tissue . a representative rt-pcr of the 18 s rrna gene is also shown, confirming the integrity of all tissue rna. two crustacean cardioactive peptide  precursor transcripts were identified in t. pisana, both encoding  <dig> ccap moieties and showing very high amino acid identity with lottia and aplysia homologs . tpi-ccap <dig> and  <dig> transcripts were identified in cns and foot muscle transcriptomes, with cns ccap- <dig> being more abundant . rt-pcr demonstrated that tpi-ccap <dig> is additionally expressed within sensory tentacles. the tpi-ffamide transcript encoded  <dig> different amidated peptides; an llfamide peptide and an lffamide peptide, which show conservation with known homologs from other species within the c-terminal regions . mass spectral analysis of the cns of active t. pisana identified peptides corresponding to both llfamide and lffamide. both tpi-ffa transcripts were identified in the cns transcriptome, with ff- <dig> very highly expressed . tpi-ffa- <dig> was additionally expressed within the tentacles, digestive tract, skin and foot muscle tissues, despite not being identified from the foot muscle transcriptome.figure  <dig> characterization of theba pisana allatostatin c, ccap, ffamide, scap and nky. each protein is represented by;  primary amino acid sequence with signal sequence , cleavage sites , cysteine residues  and bioactive region ;  multiple amino acid sequence alignment with other gastropod and bivalve molluscs; and  rt-pcr expression of the neuropeptide gene within various tissues.



two tpi-nkyamide transcripts were identified that encode neuropeptide y  precursors of  <dig> and  <dig> residues, each containing cleavage sites to release two bioactive peptides, a 24-residue peptide and the 38-residue nky peptide . little amino acid conservation exists for the 24-residue peptide with other species. for the 38-residue nky precursor, conservation with other species exists primarily within the n- and c-terminal regions, with very limited amino acid identity in the middle region. mass spectral analysis of the cns identified peptides corresponding to both nky precursor peptides. both tpi-nky <dig> transcripts were observed in the cns and foot muscle transcriptomes, while tpi-nky <dig> was detected in very low amounts in the cns transcriptome only. rt-pcr found that tpi-nky <dig> was also present in the tentacles and tpi-nky <dig> was additionally found in the tentacles, digestive tract, skin and foot muscle tissue. two tpi-scap transcripts were identified that both encode precursor proteins of  <dig> amino acids, including spatial conservation of putative cleavage sites and cysteine residues . high conservation between species was observed in the n-terminal region of the bioactive peptide. mass spectral analysis of the cns identified peptides corresponding to both scap precursor peptides. both tpi-scap transcripts were identified in high abundance within the cns, and less in the foot muscle, while rt-pcr showed expression of tpi-scap <dig> in the tentacles, digestive tract and skin.

we identified from the three t. pisana transcriptomes,  <dig> transcripts with strong homology to insulins. multiple sequence comparison and phylogeny demonstrated  <dig> groups of insulin-like peptides with strong bootstrap support; tpi-insulin1a-d, tpi-insulin <dig>  tpi-insulin <dig> and tpi-insulin <dig> . tpi-insulin precursors vary in size from the largest at  <dig> amino acids  to the smallest at  <dig> amino acids . consistent with other species, the organisation of t. pisana insulins consists of a “b peptide” with  <dig> cysteines, followed by a “c peptide” and then a c-terminal “a peptide” containing  <dig> cysteines. only the tpi-insulin <dig> a peptide contains a glycine residue site for amidation. tpi-insulin <dig> and tpi-insulin <dig> were highly expressed in the cns, while only tpi-insulin1c could be identified in another transcriptome . no further rt-pcr analysis was performed to investigate insulin expression in other snail tissues.figure  <dig> identification and characterization of theba pisana insulins. phylogeny of  <dig> insulins identified and representative schematic showing the organisation of the signal peptides , bioactive peptides , cleavage sites at dibasic and tetrabasic amino acids  and cysteine  residues. scale bar represents amino acid substitutions.



prohormone convertases
we identified transcripts in each transcriptome database encoding enzymes that cleave precursor proteins, including the prohormone convertase  <dig>  and pc <dig> . tpi-pc <dig> and tpi-pc <dig> encode precursors of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively, and contain regions typical of these processing enzymes, including signal, pro and catalytic regions that are required for cleavage of dibasic amino acids. another type of convertase, the tpi-furin was also identified that encodes a partial-length furin  with a large 3’ untranslated region. multiple sequence alignment and phylogeny support their enzyme grouping .figure  <dig> identification and characterization of theba pisana prohormone convertases .  amino acid alignment between pc <dig> and pc <dig> shows strong homology, especially within the catalytic region, shown schematically in ; shown are signal , pro domain  and catalytic region .  t. pisana pcs cluster within the pc <dig>  pc <dig> and furin-type convertases. scale bar represents amino acid substitutions. genbank accession numbers for all pcs are listed in additional file  <dig> 



discussion
in this study, we extend on our understanding of gastropod biology by investigating transcriptomes of the land snail, theba pisana. deep transcript sequencing followed by in silico predictions and mass spectral analysis enabled the identification of numerous molluscan genes in this snail, including previously unknown neuropeptides. this greatly enhances our ability to utilise this species as an experimental model in neuroscience and metabolism, with the potential to enable development of molecular tools that could manipulate the physiology and behaviour of this agricultural and horticultural pest species.

deep sequencing was performed to enable the assembly of three transcriptomes representing the cns, hepatopancreas and foot muscle. since gene expression levels may vary considerably depending on animal behavioural and physiological state, tissue samples for rna transcriptome sequencing were combined from stages representing active and aestivated, reproductive and juvenile snails. with over  <dig> million raw reads providing approximately  <dig>  unigenes for each tissue, this ensured a comprehensive analysis of tissue genes. de novo assembly was necessary since no annotated reference is currently available for theba or any other helicid snail. blast analysis showed that the majority of genes matched most closely with oyster, crassostrea gigas, which represents the most expansive list of molluscan genes within the ncbi database due to the release of its genome and associated transcriptomes  <cit> . as a bivalve, c. gigas belongs to a different taxonomic group, thus our submission of the theba transcripts derived from this study ensures that helicid snail gene sequences are now far better represented in the ncbi databases. abundant unannotated transcripts suggest that there may be numerous helicid-specific sequences, or this species is at least considerably different to those currently annotated.

gastropods have long been used in experimental neuroscience projects, providing a rich source for neurological discoveries. the vast majority of these studies have used marine and freshwater gastropods, including aplysia and lymnaea. in lymnaea stagnalis, two separate studies analysed neural transcriptomes, first using normalized est screening to identify  <dig>  distinct transcripts  <cit> , which was then expanded via illumina sequencing to provide  <dig>  contigs  <cit> . a large-scale neural est screen of aplysia cns has revealed  <dig>  transcripts, including  <dig>  unique  neuronal gene products  <cit> . in our study, illumina sequencing enabled a more comprehensive identification of t. pisana cns transcripts, providing  <dig>  unigenes. several of the theba neuropeptides identified have been shown to be significantly up- or down-regulated in the brain or hemolymph of hibernating helix pomatia when compared to active individuals  <cit> . for instance, levels of peptides derived from the fmrfa, myomodulin, and probably lrnfva precursors are much more abundant when h. pomatia are in the hibernation state, suggesting they may be critical for initiating and/or maintaining metabolic arrest. the cns, hepatopancreas and foot muscle are crucial tissues regulating how snails initiate and maintain deep hypometabolic states, and therefore our comprehensive transcriptomes and associated transcriptome-derived protein databases should provide a useful platform to use for comprehensive gene-associated hypometabolic studies in these animals  <cit> .

it has been speculated that in invertebrates, insulins, which are found within neurons, may have a role in neurotransmission  <cit> . similar to vertebrate homologs, the invertebrate insulin precursor contains a and b chains, linked by a connecting  peptide. this c peptide is cleaved from the precursor and the a and b chains connect by cysteine bridges to form the mature insulin peptide  <cit> . in many cases, following cleavage of the precursor, the mature peptides are subjected to post-translational modification such as glycosylation, c-terminal amidation, acetylation, phosphorylation or sulfation  <cit> . insulin precursors are known to undergo a series of processing events that yield the functional insulin, consisting of a and b peptides bound by intermolecular disulfide bonds. we found that t. pisana have  <dig> insulins, with each sharing similar attributes common to all other insulins. the largest reported molluscan insulin has been the aplysia insulin; its involvement in regulating glucose metabolism was determined through the demonstration that aplysia insulin can reduce hemolymph glucose levels  <cit> . of all the t. pisana insulins, the tpi-insulin <dig> transcript appears to be the most highly expressed insulin in the cns. future studies are planned to determine the molecular role for this insulin.

this study shows that a prohormone convertase is present within a land snail. the ability for a cell to secrete peptides relies on specific molecular secretory machinery, including processing enzymes that contribute to the synthesis of a mature bioactive peptide. in molluscs, pcs have been reported for lymnaea, aplysia and haliotis  <cit> . the lymnaea pc <dig> gene is exclusively expressed in the neuroendocrine system and may be present as two alternatively-spliced isoforms, similar to the haliotis genes which are differentially expressed in neural tissues  <cit> . we found only one pc <dig> gene  in t. pisana, indicating that one of each is sufficient in this species to perform precursor cleavages, including cleavage of allatostatin c, ffamide and scap.

for gastropods, the hepatopancreas and foot muscle are major sites for lipid metabolism and storage, and therefore are critical during periods of starvation and hypometabolism  <cit> . the hepatopancreas is also a major source of digestive enzymes and is involved in nutrient absorption, food storage and excretion  <cit> . for that reason, it is not surprising that metabolic enzyme genes dominate transcripts annotated within the hepatopancreas. the foot muscle, on the other hand, contains numerous epiphragmin gene transcripts that encode for the epiphragmin protein, a major constituent of the epiphragm mucus that seals off the aperture during hibernation and aestivation  <cit> . the dried epiphragm is necessary to enable moisture retention while still allowing for gaseous exchange  <cit> . in the snail cernuella virgata, a major source of epiphragmin appears to be the mucous glands  <cit> , while our study also implicates the foot muscle as a rich source of this protein. the foot contains its own type of mucus-secreting cells that were likely incorporated into our foot tissue transcriptome. during prolonged hypometabolism, muscle disuse atrophy  may be a major issue and we expect that future use of this transcriptome may enable us to establish molecular pathways by which these snails circumvent damage during hibernation and aestivation. enzymes that have been implicated as key proteins in metabolic depression in other gastropod species, such as pyruvate kinase, phosphofructokinase and glutamate dehydrogenase   <cit>  are present in t. pisana transcriptomes and also represent obvious targets for future metabolic studies in this species. furthermore, gdh activity can be as much as three times higher in aestivating snails than in active animals; gdh is crucial to amino acid metabolism and in aestivating snails helps to funnel nitrogen into urea biosynthesis which leads to the elevated urea in body fluids that contributes to desiccation resistance  <cit> .

the identification of genes involved in the maintenance of land snails, as reported here, has numerous implications. prior to this study, there was a lack of gene data for land snail species, despite their importance in ecological functioning. theba pisana is one of several snails native to the mediterranean region that are now established as pests in grain crops, pastures and vineyards in southern australia, where they not only eat seedling crops and pastures, but also clog harvesting equipment and contaminate grain harvests  <cit> . the current study provides a foundation for further studies into the manipulation of pest snail behavioural/physiological states that could lead to novel treatments to control their populations. for example, as demonstrated in insect pests  <cit> , neuropeptide mimetic analogs hold potential for blocking or overstimulating receptors. there are also a number of other invasive snail species that have become major pests worldwide, including aquatic snail pests in reservoirs in israel  <cit> , the new zealand mud snail potamopyrgus antipodarum in europe, australia, japan and north america  <cit> , the golden apple snail, pomacea canaliculata, in rice fields throughout asia  <cit> , and the giant african snail achatina fulica throughout the tropics and subtropics  <cit> . in addition, the common garden snail cornu aspersum müller now inhabits large areas of western europe in man-made habitats  <cit>  and is an introduced pest of many areas of the world, including north america  <cit> , australia  <cit>  and new zealand  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study has identified the genes expressed in three tissues of theba pisana and identified numerous cns neuropeptide gene products, confirming their expression in vivo by rt-pcr and mass spectrometry. investigations can now progress into defining the function of gene products.
