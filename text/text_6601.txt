BACKGROUND
human respiratory syncytial virus  is responsible for approximately  <dig> million infections and  <dig>  deaths each year  <cit> . it is the most important cause of lower respiratory tract  infections in young children and neonates, and it is a significant cause of acute lrt-associated death in young children in developing countries  <cit> . in addition, several other high-risk groups include the elderly and immunocompromised adults. this overall clinical scenario is worsened by the lack of an available vaccine and the limited availability of specific therapeutic drugs.

the mature rsv particle comprises a ribonucleoprotein  complex that is surrounded by a protein shell formed by the matrix protein. the rnp complex consists of viral genomic rna , the nucleocapsid  protein, the phosphoprotein , m2- <dig> protein, and the large  protein  <cit> . the virus particle is surrounded by a lipid membrane in which the attachment  protein and fusion  proteins are inserted. during virus entry the g protein mediates attachment of the virus to the cell  <cit> , while the f protein mediates the fusion of the virus and host cell membrane  <cit> . two distinct virus structures are formed in rsv-infected epithelial cells that lead to a productive infection, called virus filaments and inclusion bodies. the virus filaments form at the plasma membrane on the surface of infected cells and are sites where the virus structural proteins interact to form mature filamentous virus particles. the inclusion bodies are the sites in the cell where the rnp-associated proteins and virus-specific rna accumulate  <cit> , suggesting that inclusion bodies may be accumulations of pre-assembled virus rnps prior to packaging into the progeny virus.

lrt infection due to rsv is a complicated process and several cell types are implicated in the disease progression  <cit> . disease severity due to extensive lung tissue damage correlates with enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and inflammation. rsv infection of macrophage cells in the lungs of severely infected patients has been demonstrated  <cit> , and these immune cells are proposed to play an important role in the early response to rsv infection  <cit> . the murine animal model system has been extensively used to examine the pathology of rsv infection since it is generally representative of the disease progression in the lrt of humans  <cit> . several studies have employed blood monocyte derived macrophage  cells as a model system to understand interactions between rsv and lung macrophages. however, the biological properties of macrophages is influenced by their tissue location  <cit> , suggesting that bmdm cells and pulmonary macrophage cells may behave differently with respect to rsv infection. since pulmonary macrophages play an important role during the initial stages of rsv infection we have performed a detailed molecular and cellular characterisation of rsv infection in primary murine lung macrophage cells. to obtain a better understanding of the interaction of rsv with lung-derived primary murine macrophages we also used a systems-based approach to examine the effect of rsv infection on the host transciptome during the early and late stages of infection.

RESULTS
rsv exhibits similar replication characteristics in alveolar macrophage and pulmonary macrophage cells
alveolar macrophage  cells represent a minor population of the total pulmonary lung macrophage population. however, although amΦ cells may exhibit some distinct biological properties from the total lung macrophage population, they are expected to exhibit broadly similar tissue-specific biological properties to the bulk lung macrophage population  <cit> . we isolated an average of 2x <dig> alveolar macrophage  cells per mouse from broncho-alveolar lavage fluid, and 1x <dig> pulmonary macrophage  cells per mouse were isolated from whole lung tissue. these macrophage cell preparations were stained using antibodies which recognise murine macrophage antigenic markers cd11b, cd11c and f4/ <dig>  <cit>  and examined by fluorescence  microscopy. approximately 95% of the adhered cells showed cd11b and f4/ <dig> staining, confirming their murine macrophage origin . the amΦ and pmΦ cell preparations were infected with rsv and at  <dig> hpi, rsv-infected cells were stained with anti-rsv and imaged using if microscopy. the numbers of stained cells  and total cell numbers  in the same field of view allowed an estimation of cell infection levels. the presence of virus antigen in >95% of the cells in either cell preparation indicated efficient infection , suggesting that each cell preparation was similarly susceptible to rsv infection. the expression of virus proteins in the virus-infected pmФ cells was further confirmed by immunoblotting infected cell lysates using anti-n, anti-p anti-g, anti-f and anti-m2- <dig> which revealed protein species of the expected sizes .

virus-infected pmΦ cells were labelled either with anti-f or anti-g and examined using fluorescence scanning confocal microscopy  , which revealed a structured punctuate staining pattern on the surface of infected cells in each case. a similar staining pattern was also observed on anti-f labelled rsv-infected amФ cells . in permissive cell types such as hep <dig> cells the infectious particles form filamentous structures that allow cell to cell transmission. however, in both cases this surface staining pattern observed in macrophage cells was distinct from the anti-f stained filamentous virus particles that form on the permissive hep <dig> cell line . scanning electron microscopy  revealed the presence of membrane ruffling on both mock-and virus-infected pmΦ cells, with increased membrane ruffling following virus infection . similarly, transmission electron microscopy  revealed numerous membrane protrusions on mock-infected and rsv-infected cells , with increased appearance of these structures on virus-infected cells. both electron microscopy techniques indicated increased membrane ruffling during virus infection but the absence of progeny virus.

examination of anti-rsv stained pmΦ cells revealed cytoplasmic structures that were similar in appearance to inclusion bodies . the presence of heat shock protein  <dig>  within inclusion bodies has been reported  <cit> , and co-staining of infected pmΦ cells with anti-rsv and anti-hsp <dig> indicated the presence of hsp <dig> in these structures ). a similar staining pattern was also detected within rsv-infected amФ cells labelled with anti-rsv . the pmΦ cells exhibited phagocytic activity , and the presence of lamp <dig> in mature phagosomes has been established  <cit> . to distinguish the inclusion bodies from phagosomes the infected cells were co-stained with anti-lamp <dig> and anti-rsv, and examined using fscm . co-staining with anti-lamp <dig> was not observed in these structures suggesting that the anti-rsv staining pattern was due to inclusion bodies and not phagocytosed virus antigen.

similar vrna levels at between  <dig>  and  <dig> hpi were detected  suggesting low levels of vrna synthesis. the virus infectivity recovered in rsv-infected hep <dig> and pmΦ cells was compared by plaque assay which indicated virus titres of 3x <dig> pfu/ml and 2x <dig> pfu/ml respectively. this low level of virus recovered from the infected pmΦ cells was likely due to residual virus from the input virus inoculum. similarly the tissue culture supernatant  of rsv-infected hep <dig> and pmΦ cells was added to hep <dig> cells and anti-rsv stained cells detected using if microscopy. an abundance of stained cells was observed with the tcs of the infected hep <dig> cells indicating efficient progeny virus production. in contrast using this assay we failed to observe stained cells using the tcs of rsv-infected amΦ cells and only sporadic stained cells were detected using the tcs of rsv-infected pmΦ cells .

collectively although these data indicated that rsv infection results in the formation of virus antigen and the production of inclusion bodies, efficient infectious virus particle production does not occur. this is consistent with previous observations indicating abortive infection in lung macrophages  <cit> . these data also suggest that the amΦ and pmΦ cells preparations behave similarly with respect to challenge with rsv.

global gene expression changes in rsv-infected pulmonary macrophage  cells
macrophage cell activation is associated with changes in the macrophage transcriptome leading to cell reprogramming  <cit> . the effect of rsv infection on the host cell transcriptome was examined using the genechip® mouse genome  <dig>  <dig>  array  high density microarray system. this provides a sensitive method to monitor virus-induced changes in the global gene expression profile at the early stages in infection. the amΦ and pmΦ cell preparations behaved similarly with regards to rsv infection, however due to logistical difficulties in obtaining sufficient amФ cells for the microarray analysis, the gene expression analysis was restricted to the pmФ cell preparation.

there are  <dig>  annotated genes on the microarray system, and analysis of the microarray data indicated that  <dig> % of the annotated genes were expressed in mock-infected cells. this indicated that a relatively large proportion of the total transcriptome was represented in our analysis. the effect of rsv infection on host gene expression microarray at early  and late  stages in the virus infection was analysed . an  <dig> % change in the global host gene transcriptome was observed at  <dig> hpi, with  <dig> and  <dig> host genes showing up-regulated and down-regulated gene expression respectively. at  <dig> hpi this increased to  <dig> % of the total host cell transcriptome, with  <dig> and  <dig> host genes showing up-regulated and down-regulated gene expression respectively. collectively these data indicated that rsv infection caused a relatively minor change in the global host-gene expression profile by  <dig> hpi.

the genes showing virus-induced changes in expression were filtered using the fold-change  in expression levels, which allowed us to distinguish the genes showing a high fc in expression levels . a significant proportion of genes showing changes in expression levels following rsv infection were uniquely expressed at either time point. the genes showing up-regulated expression and down-regulated expression following virus infection were compared at both times of infection using a 2-fc cut-off. common up-regulated genes and down-regulated genes accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % total gene changes respectively. this suggested that distinct changes in host cell transcriptome occurred at early and late stages in infection. in general genes showing up-regulated expression exhibited a higher fold-change  in expression levels compared to those genes showing down-regulated expression, and most differentially expressed genes showed a higher fc at  <dig> hpi compared with that at  <dig> hpi. based on gene ontology the largest proportion of genes showing a greater than 10-fc increase in expression levels were functionally defined as cytokine, antiviral, signal transduction and cell-death related, while those showing the greatest reduction in expression were signal transduction and rna binding .

gene enrichment analysis based on the global gene expression changes was performed using the ingenuity pathway analysis . this was performed at each time of infection, and the canonical pathways identified at each time point were ranked based on the corresponding p value  using a cut-off of p <  <dig> . this enabled us to obtain a list of the  <dig> most significant pathway groupings at  <dig> hpi  and  <dig> hpi . a comparison of the numbers of genes showing changes in gene expression with the total number of genes in these canonical pathways indicated ratios of between approximately  <dig>  and  <dig>  . this indicated that a relatively large number of genes were represented in these canonical pathways. although in general most pathways were represented at each time of infection , their ranking in the list varied . collectively, this analysis indicates that rsv infection induces a range of antivirus responses in macrophages, from those playing a role in initial host responses involving pathogen recognition, cytokine signalling  and antigen presentation.

our analysis indicated that genes and pathways that were up-regulated were more highly represented in the global gene analysis, both in terms of gene numbers and fc in expression levels. to examine pathways that showed down-regulated expression a pathway enrichment analysis was performed on all genes that were grouped separately into either up-regulated or down-regulated expression at either time point. we generated a pathway list showing the  <dig> most significant pathways in each category . in the list, antivirus response pathways were again more highly represented at both  <dig> and  <dig> hpi for pathways showing up-regulated gene expression. in contrast, a similar pathway enrichment analysis on genes showing down-regulated expression indicated genes in pathways defined as involved in rho signalling and virus entry via endocytosis were more highly represented at  <dig> hpi. at  <dig> hpi pathways involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid metabolism were more highly represented, indicating that by  <dig> hpi virus infection may also induce changes in pathways playing a role in cellular metabolism.

validation of selected gene expression changes in rsv-infected pulmonary macrophage  cells
since genes that play a role in the antivirus responses showed the highest fc in gene expression we examined the gene expression changes of specific antivirus networks in more detail. these virus-induced changes in gene expression were also validated using independent biochemical assays.

cytokine gene expression
rsv infection was associated with increased expression of several cytokine genes . increased expression of some specific cytokine genes  could be detected at  <dig> hpi, which is consistent with previous reports suggesting early detection of these cytokines in rsv-infected cells  <cit> . however, in general the levels of these early expressed cytokines declined by  <dig> hpi. in contrast, other cytokines only showed increased expression at  <dig> hpi , indicating late or delayed expression.

the protein levels of some specific cytokines were measured in the tissue culture supernatant tcs of mock-infected and rsv-infected mΦ cells. increased levels of mip-1α , mip-1β , mcp- <dig>  il1β, il1α, rantes , tnfα and il- <dig> were observed by  <dig> hpi . this was consistent with the increased cytokine gene expression levels detected in the microarray analysis. the cytokine levels in pmΦ cells challenged with infectious virus  and ultra-violet inactivated virus  were compared to confirm that cytokine secretion was dependant on the presence of infectious virus. the hep <dig> cell line is highly susceptible to rsv infection and we failed to observe significant anti-rsv labelling of hep <dig> cells that were challenged with rsv-uvt confirming virus inactivation . similar cytokine levels in the tcs of mock-infected and rsv-uvt-infected cells were observed, and a comparison of the cytokine levels induced in rsv-nt-infected and rsv-uvt-infected pmΦ cells indicated 60% lower levels in il- <dig>  and between a 100-fold and 1000-fold lower levels of several other cytokines  in cells challenged with rsv-uvt . a similar analysis on the rsv-infected amΦ cells showed increased mip-1α, mip-1β, rantes levels and smaller increases in il <dig> and tnfα secretion when challenged with infectious rsv. mock-infected and rsv-uvt-infected cells showed similar cytokine levels in the tcs, indicating that cytokine induction only occurred in amΦ cells challenged with infectious virus . although the levels of cytokines measured in the amΦ cell preparation were lower than that measured in the pmФ cell preparation, these data indicated the increased secretion of several common pro-inflammatory cytokines in both cell preparations that have been implicated in rsv-mediated lung pathology in humans  <cit> . these data also indicated that that infectious virus was required to induce these changes in cytokine induction and cytokine signalling.

rsv-infected pmΦ cells were further examined to determine if the increased cytokine levels could be detected at later stages in the infection process. we observed elevated levels of these cytokine in the tcs of rsv-infected cells up to  <dig> hpi . we used  <dig> hpi as the cut-off in this analysis since after this time we noted significant deterioration in the appearance and condition of the macrophage preparation. however, this analysis indicated that the virus-induced increases in cytokine levels were sustained even in the absence of significant levels of progeny virus production. although at  <dig> hpi some of the cytokine gene expression levels were lower than that measured at  <dig> hpi, a sustained increase in cytokine gene expression at  <dig> hpi was still apparent, which may partly account for the sustained cytokine levels measured in the tcs.

interferon type i signalling and interferon stimulated gene expression 
interferon proteins are important cytokine mediators of the innate immune response, whose expression is induced following recognition of specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns  by pattern recognition receptors . these prrs include dexd/h  <dig>  also known as retinoic acid inducible gene i , and interferon-induced helicase c domain-containing protein  <dig>  also known as melanoma differentiation-associated gene- <dig> . a small increase in rig-i and mda- <dig> gene expression was detected at  <dig> hpi, but significantly larger increases in rig-i and mda- <dig> gene expression was observed by  <dig> hpi. the increased rig-i and mda- <dig> gene expression correlated with a small initial increase in ifnα gene expression , but a significantly higher increase in ifnβ gene expression. at  <dig> hpi a 150-fc in ifnβ gene expression was recorded, which declined to a 17-fc increase by  <dig> hpi. the microarray data was supported by qpcr measurements of the ifnβ mrna in mock and virus-infected cells ), which indicated an approximate 220-fc and 30-fc in expression at  <dig> and  <dig> hpi respectively. both methods showed the same magnitude of gene expression changes, and similar trends in gene expression changes. although there was a variation in fc values obtained using microarray analysis and qpcr analysis, both methods showed consistent trends in ifnβ gene expression. the differences observed in fc values in gene expression levels obtained using these two methods has been the subject of several reports  <cit> .

increased type i ifn  expression would be expected to lead to stat- <dig> activation, and the activation status of the stat- <dig> in rsv-infected pmΦ cells was examined. rsv-infected cells were harvested at between  <dig>  and  <dig> hpi and the presence of stat- <dig> and phosphorylated stat- <dig>  was detected at each time-point by immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies . comparable levels of stat- <dig> were detected at all the time points examined, while pstat- <dig> was detected at between  <dig> and  <dig> hpi. although the stat- <dig> levels did not decline during the course of infection, a reduction in pstat- <dig> levels was observed from between  <dig> and  <dig> hpi. the reason for this reduction in pstat- <dig> is currently uncertain, but was consistent with a decline in ifnβ mrna levels indicated by both the qpcr and microarray data.

activation of the stat- <dig> would be expected to lead to the expression of several ifn stimulated genes  . although the microarray analysis indicated basal levels of isg expression at  <dig> hpi, relatively large increases in isg expression levels was detected at  <dig> hpi , which was consistent with stat- <dig> activation. the increased isgs detected included several isgs with relatively well characterized anti-virus activities  protein and rsad2), and several other isgs with less well characterized anti-virus activities . the microarray analysis was validated using qpcr to compare the mrna levels of several selected isgs in mock and infected cells ).

cell death signalling
the increased expression of xiap associated factor  <dig>  was detected in the microarray analysis , and xaf <dig> is a pro-apoptotic protein that inhibits the anti-apoptotic activities of the xiap  <cit> . jnk activation can be mediated via type i ifn signalling pathways  <cit> , and the role of isg products have been implicated in p <dig> and jnk activation  <cit> . furthermore, xaf <dig> expression is enhanced by activated jnk  <cit> , and the activation status of the jnk pathway was therefore examined in rsv-infected mФ cells. cells were infected with rsv and at between  <dig> mins post-infection and  <dig> hpi the presence of jnk and phosphorylated jnk  was detected . significant pjnk levels was only detected at  <dig> hpi, the pjnk levels appeared to decline by  <dig> hpi in a similar manner which may be related to the decline in ifnβ mrna levels at  <dig> hpi. a role for jnk activation in regulating apoptosis has been proposed , and the correlation between jnk activation and enhanced expression of xaf <dig> is consistent with jnk playing a role in the induction of cell-death pathways in rsv-infected pmФ cells.

macrophage activation and antigen presentation gene expression
several genes involved in macrophage activation and antigen presentation showed up-regulated gene expression at  <dig> hpi . these genes included cd <dig> antigen, macrophage activation  <dig> like gene expression, and transporter  <dig> atp-binding cassette . the up-regulated expression of several genes encoding proteosomal proteins that play an important role in inflammation antigen presentation  <cit>  was also detected at  <dig> hpi. the microarray analysis was validated using qpcr, which showed an approximate 35-fold increase in the cd <dig> and tap <dig> gene expression by  <dig> hpi ), consistent with the gene enrichment analysis indicating the presence of antigen-presentation pathways at  <dig> hpi.

examination of infected cells by if microscopy revealed that inclusion bodies could be detected in virus-infected pmФ cells up to  <dig> hpi  and ,), indicating that these virus structures persisted in infected macrophage cells at later times in the infection process, and even in the absence of infectious virus production. the inclusion bodies detected at  <dig> hpi were considerably smaller than those observed in rsv-infected hep <dig> cells at a similar time of infection ). this indicated a slower rate of inclusion body formation in pmФ cells, consistent with slow rates of vrna gene transcription in these cells. we noted that from  <dig> hpi an additional diffuse anti-rsv staining pattern was observed which became more prominent at  <dig> hpi , highlighted by *). this was distinct from the more compact staining pattern observed for inclusion bodies and we presumed that this alternative staining pattern could arise due to the phagocytosis of virus antigen. infected cells were co-stained with anti-rsv and anti-lamp <dig> and while the inclusion bodies did not co-localise with anti-lamp <dig> , we noted extensive co-localisation of anti-lamp <dig> with these diffusely anti-rsv staining structures . this suggested that this alternative staining pattern indicated sites within the cell where engulfment of virus antigen by mature phagosomes occurs, and was consistent with the up-regulated expression of several genes involved in proteosomal degradation and antigen presentation.

discussion
disease severity due to rsv infection is likely to be partly determined by a combination of the genetic characteristics of the host  <cit>  and the capacity of different rsv strains to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines <cit> . in addition rsv can cause a persistent infection in susceptible hosts correlating with prolonged disease symptoms  <cit> . histopathology of fatal cases of rsv infection have demonstrated infection of lung macrophage cells  <cit> , although no evidence for the presence of infectious rsv particles was noted. our observations are consistent with abortive replication in lung macrophages, and is consistent with in vitro studies on mouse  <cit>  and human lung macrophage cells  <cit> . however, in contrast to these previous studies our study demonstrated virus gene expression and the formation of inclusion bodies, the latter being a characteristic of productive rsv infection. however, it appears that cellular processes are activated during virus infection that block the formation of infectious virus particles. therefore, although all the available data suggests that lung macrophages are an important source of pro-inflammatory cytokines during rsv infection, they may not significantly contribute to virus propagation in the lower airway.

the capacity of rsv to overcome the ifn antivirus response and replicate in epithelial cells has been described  <cit> . the interaction between stat- <dig> and stat- <dig> is required for ifn signalling and these previous studies suggest inhibition of type  <dig> interferon occurs by down-regulation of stat <dig> expression. the virus-induced stat signalling that we observe in rsv infected macrophages suggests that down regulated expression of the stat proteins did not occur in lung macrophage cells. the precise mechanism that leads to the inability of rsv to counter the ifn response in pulmonary macrophage cells is currently unclear and will require further examination. however, our data suggests that infectious virus particles are required for inducing the host response to infection, suggesting that initial events related to an early stage in the rsv replication cycle initiates the antivirus responses. the correlation between ifn signalling and abortive infection suggests that this response may play a role in restricting the formation of infectious virus. the expression of several isgs with proven anti-viral activities was recorded  <cit> , but it is currently unclear if one or more these isgs block the formation of mature rsv particles that leads to the abortive infection in lung macrophages.

in addition to isg expression we noted the up-regulated expression of several genes involved in proteosomal degradation and antigen presentation. it is expected that this process leads to the display of rsv-related peptides on the surface of the macrophage cells . although we were able to detect strong fluorescence staining of the virus surface glycoproteins on surface of infected macrophages, we failed to detect the presence of similar levels of the corresponding proteins by western blotting. this suggests that the virus glycoproteins may undergo proteolytic degradation, and since the expression of the virus glycoproteins is required for generating infectious virus this may also partly account for the abortive infection in these cells. in contrast, the presence of numerous virus-induced inclusion bodies was detected later in the virus infection, suggesting that the polymerase associated proteins persisted in infected cells. this was consistent with the ready detection of the rnp-associated n, p and m2- <dig> proteins by immunoblotting of cell lysates prepared from infected cell lysates. the available data suggests that inclusion bodies may represent sites of virus genome transcription , and that sequestering these proteins into the rnps may protect these proteins from proteosomal degradation during the initial phase of infection . although the inclusion bodies are largely engulfed within phagosomes during the later stages of infection, the formation of these structures early in infection may provide increased resistance of the virus rnp-associated virus proteins to proteosomal degradation. thus the presence of the inclusion bodies even in the presence of a potent antivirus response may play a role in the persistence of immunopathologic symptoms that have been reported in rsv-infected mice  <cit> .

although recent evidence suggests that circulating rsv strains exhibit slow rates of evolution  <cit> , they may also differ in their capacity to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . our analysis of the infected lung macrophage cells indicates a sustained pro-inflammatory cytokine response in the absence of productive infection. this suggests that strategies that can control the pro-inflammatory response may be useful in the treatment of patients with lrt rsv infection. future studies will use the in vitro macrophage cell system described here to characterise the host response of different clinical strains. careful analysis of transcriptome responses in field isolates should improve our understanding of the interaction between rsv and macrophages during the initial stages of lrt infection. this may lead to the identification of important cell signalling pathways that mediate the host anti-virus response to infection, which in turn could lead to the identification of novel drug targets to control the pro-inflammatory responses during rsv infection.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study that has used global gene expression to examine the host response in rsv-infected murine lung macrophages. our data shows that although rsv challenge leads to an abortive infection, virus antigen within inclusion bodies are formed. rsv challenge leads to up-regulated expression of genes involved in pathogen recognition, interferon signalling, inflammation and macrophage activation. the sustained pro-inflammatory cytokine levels even in the absence of a productive infection may help explain the persistence of symptoms that are associated with lrti. in addition our data suggests that drugs that control the pro-inflammatory response may be useful in the treatment of patients with severe rsv infection.
