BACKGROUND
shigella flexneri, as well as s. dysenteriae, s. boydii, and s. sonnei, are the causative agents of shigellosis, an acute diarrheal disease common in developing countries. the annual number of shigellosis cases throughout the world has been estimated to be  <dig>  million, of which  <dig>  million were in developing countries, with  <dig>  million deaths, and  <dig>  million in industrialized countries  <cit> . s. flexneri is the predominant species in developing countries and the second most common in industrialized countries  <cit> . s. flexneri comprises eight serotypes,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  x, and y, with at least  <dig> subserotypes, 1a, 1b, 1c, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, 4c, 5a, and 5b  <cit> , of which 2a is the most prevalent subserotype in the world  <cit> . the x and y serotypes can be derived from some subserotypes of serotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  such as 2b, 4c and 5b for serotype x and 1a, 2a, 4a and 5a for serotype y, by losing the type factor antigens  <cit> . multilocus sequencing typing  analysis has revealed that the s. flexneri serotypes 1- <dig>  x and y are evolutionarily more related than serotype  <dig>  <cit> .

a variety of molecular typing tools have been developed to access genetic relatedness among bacterial isolates. in general, molecular markers with low variability can be used to establish phylogenetic relationships among bacterial isolates evolved over longer time spans, and highly variable markers are more useful to resolve closely related isolates for the purposes of outbreak investigation and disease surveillance. mlst, one of these molecular tools, is a sequence-based method that has been successfully applied to establish phylogenetic structure for some bacterial pathogens, such as neisseria meningitidis and streptococcus pneumoniae  <cit> . however, to public health laboratories, mlst is not sufficiently discriminative in distinguishing closely related isolates for the epidemiological investigation of clusters of infection. in contrast, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  is highly discriminatory for many bacterial pathogens and has been adopted as the standard typing method by an international molecular subtyping network, pulsenet international, for foodborne disease surveillance  <cit> . although this method has been proven by the pulsenet laboratories to be a powerful tool for the routine subtyping of some foodborne bacterial pathogens in detecting clusters of infection, pfge is occasionally not discriminatory enough in distinguishing some epidemiologically unrelated s. sonnei isolates. in total, pfge is suitable to resolve closely related isolates but not an appropriate tool for establishing phylogenetic relationships between bacterial isolates that have evolved over a longer time span.

multilocus variable-number tandem repeat  analysis  is prominent typing tool which has been developed for a variety of bacterial pathogens  <cit> . this method is based on variation in the number of repeats at multiple vntr loci, which can be highly variable or relatively stable. study has demonstrated that mlva based on four to eight highly variable vntr loci can exhibit a discriminatory power parallel to or higher than pfge  <cit>  and that a method based on combined loci with different variability values can be applied to establish phylogenetic relationships among strains with different evolutionary timescales  <cit> . in the present study, we aim to develop and evaluate a mlva method for fine typing and phylogenetic analysis of s. flexneri isolates.

RESULTS
vntr loci
in total,  <dig> vntr loci were identified after testing  <dig> selected tandem repeat loci on nine s. flexneri isolates of various subserotypes. the locations, copy number, and sizes of amplicons for the  <dig> vntrs in s. flexneri sequenced strains  <dig>  2457t and  <dig> and the gene or encoding protein involved are listed in table s <dig> . fifteen of the loci are located within pseudogenes. the  <dig> vntr markers were analyzed on  <dig> s. flexneri isolates of various serotypes and subserotypes. the resulting data revealed that  <dig> of the  <dig> loci exhibited 100% typability . four loci  had a low typability rate that was primarily attributed to the absence of pcr amplicon from  <dig> 4a/y isolates, which had common origin. there were, respectively,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> polymorphic loci detected in serotype groups 1a/1b/nt , 2a/2b/x/nt, 3a/3b, 4a/4b/y and  <dig>  there were three loci polymorphic in four of the five serotype groups, nine in three serotype groups, ten in two serotype groups and eleven in one serotype group. three loci  were not polymorphic in any of the five serotype groups. ten loci bore alleles with a high copy number  of repeats . of the  <dig> loci, one locus  was polymorphic in four serotype groups,  <dig> in three serotype groups,  <dig> in two serotype groups and  <dig> in only one serotype group. of the  <dig> vntr loci, one that had low variability in the serotype groups usually bore an allele with a low copy number of repeats. sf <dig> was an exception; it had no polymorphism in the serotype groups 1a/1b/nt and 2a/2b/x/nt, but it contained an allele with a high number  of repeats.

phylogenetic relationships established using pfge patterns
the pfge analysis with noti restriction enzyme identified  <dig> patterns among the  <dig> isolates. a dendrogram generated using the pfge patterns is shown in figure  <dig>  the dendrogram with detail information including isolate code, pfge code, serotype, year of isolation, mlva code, outbreak and origin other than taiwan is shown in figure s <dig> . based on the serotypes and levels of genetic similarity among the isolates, six clusters  and four singletons  were designated. the groupings were correlated with serotypes. the clusters c <dig> to c <dig>  respectively, contained isolates of 4a/y, 3a/3b, 1a/1b, 2a/2b/x/nt,  <dig> and 3a. isolates of serotype  <dig> were distributed in two distinct clusters, c <dig>  and c <dig> . the four single singletons were respectively assigned for isolates with serotype y, subserotype 2b, subserotype 4b, and nt. s <dig> , originated from egypt, was far distant from cluster c <dig> . s <dig> , originated from india, was also distantly related from cluster c <dig> . a serotype y isolate and  <dig> subserotype 4a isolates within cluster c <dig> was recovered from a prolonged shigellosis outbreak occurring in a long stay psychiatric center  <cit> ; they shared 76% or higher pattern similarity. these isolates shared only 57% similarity with another subserotype 4a isolate. the isolates within cluster c <dig> were further classified into three subclusters . isolates within each of the three subclusters shared 80% or higher similarity. all the imported isolates in cluster c <dig> fell into subcluster c4a. subcluster c4c consisted of  <dig> serotype x and two subserotype 2b isolates; the serotype x and one subserotype 2b isolates were recovered from a shigellosis outbreak.

phylogenetic relationships constructed using mlva profiles
in total,  <dig> mlva types were identified in the  <dig> isolates. a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the mlva profiles and a minimum spanning tree  algorithm. the groupings established with mlva profiles and pfge patterns were highly concordant, with  <dig> % congruence. on the basis of serotypes and the clusters established using pfge data, a mlva cluster was defined for genotypes that differed at eight loci or fewer among the  <dig> total loci. as a result, six mlva clusters  and one singleton  were designated . the groupings based on pfge and mlva were almost consistent, except that the serotype y  and subserotype 4b  isolates were grouped into cluster mc <dig> and the nt  isolate was grouped into cluster mc <dig>  cluster mc <dig> consisted of  <dig> subserotype 4a, two serotype y and one subserotype 4b isolates. one serotype y and  <dig> subserotype 4a isolates were closely related; the serotype y isolate differed at only one locus from the predominant type for subserotype 4a isolates. the remaining subserotype 4a isolate differed at two loci from a serotype y  isolate. the subserotype 4b  had a distance of at least seven loci from others within cluster mc <dig>  cluster mc <dig> consisted of two subserotype 3a and four subserotype 3b isolates; they were closely related. one subserotype 3a isolate different at only two loci from a subserotype 3b isolate. cluster mc <dig> contained three subserotype 1a, eight subserotype 1b and one nt isolates. they formed three tight subclusters; one subcluster consisted of six subserotype 1b isolates, which were recovered from an outbreak. within this cluster, one subserotype 1a isolate differed at a single locus only from a subserotype 1b isolate. cluster mc <dig> consisted of  <dig> serotype x,  <dig> subserotype 2a, four subserotype 2b and one nt isolates; they were relatively divergent. the three subclusters, c4a, c4b and c4c, designated on the basis of pfge similarity were indicated in figure 2a. the isolates in subcluster c4a showed a considerably diverse phylogenetic pattern; they were separated by subcluster c4b. the imported isolates were distributed more closely than most of others within this subcluster. the isolates in subcluster c4b as well as those in subcluster c4c were grouped tightly. subcluster c4c consisted of  <dig> serotype x and two subserotype 2b isolates; one subserotype 2b isolate displayed an identical profile with a serotype x isolate. mc <dig> consisted of six subserotype 3a isolates; they formed a relatively diverse phylogenetic pattern. the imported isolate had a distance of at least eight loci from others within this cluster.

discriminatory power of pfge and mlva
pfge, mlva <dig> , mlva <dig> and mlva <dig> discriminated the total isolates into  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genotypes, respectively . more genotypes were obtained by pfge than mlva <dig> and mlva <dig> but the level of discriminatory power for mlva <dig> and mlva <dig> was, though not significantly, higher than that for pfge. for the panel of  <dig> diverse subserotype 2a isolates, mlva <dig>  mlva <dig> and mlva <dig> displayed better resolution than pfge, though the difference of discriminatory power was not significant. pfge, mlva <dig> and mlva <dig> divided the panel of  <dig> closely-related 4a/y isolates into  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genotypes but the two mlva assays exhibited higher discriminatory power than pfge, though not significantly.

subtyping of isolates from outbreaks
a total of  <dig> isolates recovered from eight shigellosis outbreaks were used to evaluate the usefulness of mlva in discriminating isolates for disease outbreak investigation. from outbreak a,  <dig> subserotype 4a and one serotype y isolates were recovered , while  <dig> serotype x and one subserotype 2b and were recovered from outbreak k. isolates from four outbreaks  displayed two or more pfge patterns, while the isolates from outbreaks h and i shared a common pfge pattern.

aisolates for two outbreaks sharing a common pfge pattern but different mlva type

isolates from four outbreaks  displayed two or more mlva types . the isolates from outbreaks h and i, sharing a common pfge pattern, had different mlva types. the isolates from four outbreaks  displayed only one mlva type; notably, the isolates from these outbreaks were recovered over a short time period. the  <dig> isolates for outbreak a, recovered from a long-stay psychiatric nursing center over a long time period , were chronically divergent; four loci were variable among the isolates . outbreaks b and k, which occurred in a military camp and a long-stay psychiatric nursing center, respectively, lasted for only a few days; however, the isolates were considerably diverse. four mlva types were found in the six isolates from outbreak b, with variations in two loci. five mlva types were found in the  <dig> isolates from outbreak k, with variations in four loci; a distance of three loci was seen among the five types. the four isolates for outbreak e were recovered over a period of six months; the first three isolates shared the same mlva type but the one recovered last differed at two loci from the first three.

discussion
vntr markers display a wide range of variability; combining vntr loci with various variability values can be used to discern various levels of genetic relatedness between bacterial isolates. in our previous studies, we identified  <dig> vntr markers for s. sonnei and evaluated the usefulness of the mlva method as a tool for fine typing and phylogenetic analysis of bacterial isolates  <cit> . these studies indicated that mlva based on four to eight highly variable loci is sufficient to resolve closely related isolates for disease surveillance and investigations of outbreaks. in contrast, combining loci with lower variability values are suitable to establish clear phylogenetic patterns among strains evolved over a longer time span. theoretically, the more number of loci are used, a higher discriminatory power can be achieved and subtler phylogenetic relationships among bacterial strains can be established. unlike s. sonnei, which has only one serotype, s. flexneri has eight serotypes with at least  <dig> subserotypes  <cit> . since vntr markers can be serotype-specific, it is necessary to explore more loci at the moment of development.

in order to identify as many vntr markers as possible, we explored vntr candidates from the released genomic sequences of s. flexneri and other shigella species using the vntrdb computer program  <cit> . after testing  <dig> vntr candidates on nine isolates of different subserotypes, we identified  <dig> loci that were polymorphic among the isolates. a further evaluation of the  <dig> loci on a total of  <dig> s. flexneri isolates from various serotypes and subserotypes suggested that variability of some of the  <dig> loci could be serotype-specific. for instance, seven loci  were not polymorphic among the diverse isolates within the 2a/2b/x/nt group; but they were polymorphic among isolates in the 3a/3b, 4a/4b/y and  <dig> groups . in addition, sf <dig> and sf <dig> are highly variable in the 3a/3b group. however, this observation of serotype specificity could be biased because the number of isolates tested for a serotype group was limited or may have been clonal. for the 2a/2b/x/nt and 3a/3b groups, the isolates were relatively divergent and more variable loci were therefore observed. for the 1a/1b/nt, 4a/4b/y and  <dig> serotype groups, the number of isolates was either too small or most isolates were closely related; only a small portion of the  <dig> loci was observed to be variable in these groups. it is expected that more variable loci could be found for the serotypes when a larger number of diverse isolates are analyzed.

many studies have indicated that mlva is more powerful than pfge in discriminating bacterial isolates  <cit>  <cit>  <cit> ; thus, it can complement or replace pfge as a routine subtyping tool for outbreak investigation and disease surveillance. in the present study we showed that mlva was able to discriminate isolates from two outbreaks that shared an indistinguishable pfge pattern. for the panel of  <dig> diverse subserotype 2a isolates, the mlva assays using four and eight most variable loci was able to discriminate the isolates into more genotypes than pfge, although the discriminatory power was not significantly greater . a similar result was observed on a panel of  <dig> closely related 4a/y isolates. although the mlva assay using four most variable loci discriminated the  <dig> closely related 4a/y isolates into fewer genotypes than pfge, the discriminatory power for the mlva <dig> assay was higher than that for pfge. as the resolving power of mlva to closely related isolates is primarily attributed to highly variable vntr markers  <cit> , an mlva assay based on four to eight highly variable loci can display a resolving power comparable to or higher than pfge.

vntr markers have various degrees of variability, making mlva as a useful molecular tool for phylogenetic study of bacterial isolates. mlva has been applied to investigate the clonal relationships among isolates of yersinia pestis  <cit> , n. meningitidis  <cit>  and s. sonnei  <cit> . in the present study, we used mlva profiles to establish phylogenetic relationships among  <dig> s. flexneri isolates with various serotypes. by defining a clonal group as one that includes genotypes differing at eight loci or fewer between the two closest genotypes, the grouping based on the mlva profiles is highly in agreement with that based on the pfge patterns . the analysis based on mlva profiles establishes clear phylogenetic patterns among different serotype groups. the isolates of serotype  <dig> are distributed into two distinct clonal groups, suggesting that the mlva method developed in this study is also able to discern clonal groups among isolates within the same serotype.

the phylogenetic analysis using mlva profiles as well as pfge patterns also indicates that isolates with different subserotypes within a serotype can be genetically more closely related than those with the same subserotype. for example, one subserotype 1a isolate in cluster mc <dig> is more closely related to a subserotype 1b isolate than other subserotype 1a isolates . a similar result is also observed between one subserotype 3a and one subserotype 3b isolates in cluster mc <dig>  the analysis also indicates that the two serotype y isolates and the  <dig> serotype x isolates could be derived from strains of serotype  <dig> and serotype  <dig>  respectively, whereas the two nt isolates are related to serotype  <dig> and serotype  <dig> 

recently, gorgé et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> vntr loci by exploring five genomic sequences of four shigella species for typing of shigella spp. the  <dig> loci were evaluated on  <dig> isolates of e. coli and shigella species including  <dig> s. flexneri isolates of eight serotypes. thirteen of the  <dig> loci were polymorphic in the s. flexneri isolates. of the  <dig> loci,  <dig> are included in the  <dig> loci identified in the present study. although mlva based on the  <dig> loci could effectively distinguish between the isolates of four shigella species and pathogenic e. coli, grouping analysis based on the mlva profiles was not able to distinguish among the four shigella species. although mlva may not be effectively to establish phylogenetic relationships among isolates from different species of the same genus due to the specificity of vntr markers; it can be a suitable phylogenetic analysis tool for monomorphic bacterial species, such as s. sonnei  <cit> . our data indicate that the vntr markers identified in the present study are applicable to establish clear phylogenetic relationships among serotypes groups and discerning clonal groups among isolates within a serotype.

a total of  <dig> isolates from eight outbreaks were analyzed using mlva and pfge in order to compare both genotyping methods in their ability to characterize isolates for disease outbreak investigation. mlva was able to distinguish pfge-indistinguishable isolates from two s. flexneri 2a outbreaks. mlva also discriminated isolates from four outbreaks into two or more genotypes. theoretically, isolates collected from a prolonged outbreak, such as outbreak a, could have considerably been divergent, while isolates from an outbreak lasting for a short time period should have little variation. strikingly, outbreaks b and k do not follow this pattern. these outbreaks started and ended within a few days but the isolates had showed considerably divergent. several pfge and mlva genotypes were detected among the isolates for each of the outbreaks and no predominant type existed. this observation is difficult to explain. the strains could be hypervariable and mutants could emerge very quickly in response to host immunity, or the stains could have been circulating silently in the institutions for a while.

CONCLUSIONS
a total of  <dig> vntr markers were identified; they exhibited different degrees of variability among various s. flexneri serotype groups. vntr locus could be highly variable in isolates of a serotype but invariable in other serotypes. the differences could be attributed to the fact that some of the loci were serotype-specific, the isolates for a serotype group analyzed were too clonal, or the number of isolates for a serotype group was limited. mlva based on four highly variable loci is able to display a comparable resolving power to pfge in discriminating isolates. mlva is also a useful tool for phylogenetic analysis of s. flexneri; it can establish clear clonal patterns among serotype groups and also discerned clonal groups among isolates within a serotype, for example serotype  <dig>  isolates with different subserotypes within a serotype can be genetically more closely related than those with the same subserotype. isolates that had different serotype but had closer genetic relatedness than those with the same serotype were observed between serotype y and subserotype 4a, serotype x and subserotype 2b, subserotype 1a and 1b, and subserotype 3a and 3b. as highly variable vntr loci could be serotype-specific, a common mlva protocol that consists of four to eight loci and that provides high resolving power to all s. flexneri serotypes may not be obtainable.
