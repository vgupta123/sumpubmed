BACKGROUND
zebrafish  has emerged as an important model system in the study of vertebrate development due to its external development, transparency of embryos, and its demonstrated utility as a genetic model. the process of heart formation occurs in a similar way in all vertebrates  <cit> . heart development in the zebrafish is also rapid, which allows for numerous short-term studies. the primitive heart tube is formed by  <dig> hours post-fertilization . the heart is beating and the circulation becomes evident at  <dig> hpf. by  <dig> hpf, the heart tube starts to loop to the right side of the embryo. by  <dig> hpf, chamber boundaries are evident, although molecular markers can distinguish them in the primitive heart tube  <cit> . looping places both the atrium and the ventricle toward the left of the embryo, however the atrium is further to the left than the ventricle. by  <dig> hpf, the valves are present and by the fifth day, the heart has assumed its adult configuration, with the atrium sitting dorsally with respect to the ventricle  <cit> .

the fundamental plan of the vascular system as it develops in the zebrafish is similar to that of other vertebrates. the overall form of the zebrafish vasculature is established early, before the initiation of circulation, and the pattern of major vessel tracts is reproducible from embryo to embryo  <cit> . circulation begins at approximately 24– <dig> hpf and initially flows through a simple single circulatory loop. cells from the dorsal margin of the lateral plate migrate medially to form the intermediate cell mass  <cit> . this mass gives rise to both the endothelia and the major trunk vessels and the first cohort of blood cells  <cit> . however, many early vasculogenic vessels first appear as a network or plexus of smaller vessels, with little apparent pattern or differentiated identity  <cit> . by  <dig> – <dig> days postfertilization , the trunk and tail intersegmental vessels are fully formed and by  <dig> dpf, the overall basic pattern of the vaculature is in place  <cit> .

although vertebrate cardiovascular development has been well described morphologically, the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying these events are only beginning to be understood. results from gene expression pattern and/or functional studies suggest that a variety of molecules, including transcription factors , morphogenetic regulators , endothelial growth factors , cardiac specific proteins , cell adhesion molecule , are involved in the cardiac patterning and morphogenesis of the vertebrate heart  <cit> .

the cadherins are a family of ca++-dependent transmembrane molecules that mediate cell adhesion mainly through homophilic interactions  <cit> . cadherin <dig>  the first cadherin discovered in the vertebrate nervous system  <cit> , has been shown to be of critical importance in the early differentiation of the vertebrate central and peripheral nervous structures  <cit> . unlike the wide expression of cadherin <dig>  expression of cadherin <dig> , is confined to the endothelial cells of both developing and adult vasculature  <cit> . despite the importance of cardiovascular tissue itself and cadherin molecules in animal development, there are only a few published reports on cadherins function in vertebrate cardiovascular development. zebrafish with mutations in cadherin <dig>  have recently been identified, and their phenotypes studied. however, most of the analysis was concentrated on the central nervous system. so far, detailed information on the developmental profile of cadherin <dig> expression in the vertebrate cardiac tissue has been performed on only the chick and mice. moreover, functional analysis was limited almost exclusively to descriptions of anatomical defects in the heart of embryos whose cadherin <dig> function was blocked  <cit> . we propose to study cardiac differentiation, cardiac performance and formation of the vascular system in the glo mutant in order to elucidate the role of cadherin <dig> plays in the formation and function of the cardiovascular system.

RESULTS
cadherin <dig> expression in developing zebrafish heart
cadherin <dig> expression in the developing zebrafish heart was studied using whole mount in situ hybridization and immunocytochemical methods on tissue sections. strong cadherin <dig> message was detected in the developing zebrafish heart of all stages examined . expression levels were higher in the bulbus arteriosus and the ventricle than in the atrium in whole mount hearts . examination of sections from the whole mount hearts and tissue sections processed for cadherin <dig> immunostaining showed that the labeling was confined mainly to the myocardial layer at the stages examined . this was confirmed by double labeling experiments using the cadherin <dig> antibody and an anti-mouse monoclonal antibody zn- <dig>  which has been shown to recognize differentiating zebfrafish ventricular myocardium . the difference in cadherin <dig> staining between the atrium and ventricle was mainly due to the thickness of these structures with the ventricle having a myocardium consisting 2– <dig> cell layers while the atrium myocardium having a single cell layer .

analysis of cardiac performance in glo mutant embryos
the expression pattern of cadherin <dig> in the embryonic zebrafish heart suggests that this adhesion molecule is involved in the development of normal zebrafish cardiac function. we tested this idea by examining several key cardiac performance parameters: heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and contraction time in control and glo mutant 30– <dig> hpf embryos . by  <dig> hpf, these parameters can be readily recorded under an inverted dissection microscope. mean heart rates of glo mutant embryos were lower than controls at this stage, but the difference was not statistically significant . the heart rates increased by almost 60% in both groups over the 42-hour measurement period. however, the trajectory of this increase was significantly different between the control and glo mutant embryos. between 30– <dig> hpf, differences between the mean heart rates of these two groups grew more prominent, with the values significantly lower in the glo mutant embryos than the controls at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf . interestingly, differences in the heart rates between the two groups became smaller between 48– <dig> hpf, due to a faster increase in the glo mutant heart rates. although the mean heart rates were still significantly lower for glo mutant embryos at  <dig> hpf, their values were similar to the controls at  <dig> hpf. moreover, variations in hearts rate were also significantly higher in the glo mutant embryos.

mean stroke volume in control and glo mutant hearts was similar at  <dig> hpf, and it became larger in both groups as development proceeded . in control embryos, stroke volume increased more rapidly during development with the difference showing statistical significance at  <dig> hpf. this late significance was due, at least partially, to large variations of the stroke volume in both groups. multiplying stroke volume by heart rate produces cardiac output . mean cardiac output increased in both groups during the 42-hour measurement period with the slope of the increase significantly higher in the control group. as with stroke volume, cardiac output was similar between the two groups at  <dig> hpf, and the control embryos had higher cardiac output than the glo mutant embryos at the remaining recording time points, although their values were not significantly different until  <dig> hpf. again, cardiac output variability was high in both groups.

for the majority of the developmental window investigated, the contraction time  for glo mutant hearts was slower than controls . this difference was statistically significant during the first two measurement times , but by  <dig> hpf, the contraction time became similar between the glo and control hearts. moreover, the variation in contraction times was also significantly higher in the glo mutant hearts, reflecting the irregular nature of cardiac contractions in this group.

gross morphological defects in the heart of the glo mutant and cadherin <dig> morphants
the decreased cardiac function in the glo mutant embryos was likely caused by morphological changes in the mutant heart. the pericardial cavity was greatly enlarged in all glo mutants , in most  of cadherin <dig> morphants , but in only a small number  of embryos injected with a standard control morpholino oligonucleotide. glo mutant embryos become readily distinguishable from their heterozygous and wild type cohorts at  <dig> hpf by having tail blisters or clubbed tails  <cit> . at this stage the pericardial cavity of the glo mutant embryos was similar in size to control embryos. the glo mutant pericardial cavity remained similar in size to control embryos at  <dig> and  <dig> hpf , but by  <dig> hpf, the glo mutant pericardial cavity had become greatly enlarged compared to the control embryos .

in control 48– <dig> hpf embryos, the linear cardiac tube, oriented rostrocaudally in younger stages, has developed into the atrium and ventricle, separated by the atrioventricular constriction, with the former located ventrally and to the left of the latter  <cit> . both the atrium and ventricle are either tubular or oval shaped with smooth surfaces. gross cardiac morphological defects varied in the glo mutant embryos, with some showing tubular, often smaller, atrium and ventricle , while others exhibiting irregular shaped atrium and/or ventricle, often with uneven surfaces . moreover, the looping of the heart evident in the control  was mostly missing in the mutant heart . some gross cardiac morphological changes were easily detectable at  <dig> hpf . similar gross cardiac defects were obvious in about half of the cadherin <dig> morphants examined , but often with less severity than the glo mutants, and no obvious gross cardiac defects were seen in embryos injected with the standard control morpholino oligonucleotide  or in the pac mutants as reported by  <cit> .

differentiation of the glo mutant heart is affected
cardiac differentiation of the glo mutants and cadherin <dig> morphants was analyzed using cardiac specific markers nkx <dig> , cmlc <dig>  vmhc  <cit> , cdh <dig>  <cit>  or zn- <dig> immunostaining. nkx <dig>  is a transcription factor crucial for vertebrate cardiac development  <cit> , and it is expressed mainly by the ventricle at 48– <dig> hpf . its mrna expression in the glo mutant heart appeared to be similar to the control heart . cmlc <dig> labels the cardiac myosin light chain  <dig> present in both the embryonic zebrafish atrium and ventricle . similar to cmlc <dig> expression in the control heart, cmlc <dig> was expressed by both the atrium and ventricle of the glo mutant heart . zebrafish vmhc stands for the ventricular myosin heavy chain gene, and it labels the ventricular myocardium and skeletal muscles of the body . vmhc expression was moderately or greatly reduced in the glo mutant heart, while its expression in their trunk muscle appeared to be less affected . cdh <dig> is expressed by zebrafish endothelial layer of the heart throughout embryonic development, with stronger expression in the ventricle than the atrium in two-day old embryos . expression of cdh <dig> in the glo mutant heart was similar to the control .

in the control ventricle, zn- <dig> immunostaining was concentrated on the cell membrane of the myocardiocytes . the ventricular myocardiocytes in control embryos at 48– <dig> hpf were elongated, fusiform shaped, and form tight associations with one another . zn- <dig> labeling of the myocardiocytes in embryos injected with the standard control morpholino oligonucleotide was indistinguishable from that in wild type control embryos . similar to the control heart, zn- <dig> immunoreactivity in the glo and pac mutants and cadherin <dig> morphant hearts was confined mainly to the ventricle , but the staining within the mutant and morphant heart ventricles was greatly altered. zn- <dig> labeling was detected both on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm of many glo and pac mutants, and in cadherin <dig> morphant myocardiocytes . these cells were often roundly shaped, scattered or formed clusters. these changes were also detected in younger glo mutant embryos .

formation of the vascular system in glo mutants is affected
the enlarged pericardial cavity in cadherin <dig> morphants and glo mutant embryos may be caused by a poorly developed vascular system in these animals, resulting in an accumulation of fluid in the pericardial cavity. we examined vasculature formation in the glo mutant embryos using the endothelial marker cdh <dig> . although some of the major blood vessels were present at  <dig> hpf in the mutants, their staining was greatly reduced compared to control embryos . intersegmental vessels in the body and tail are well-developed in control embryos at this stage , but poorly formed in the glo mutants . by  <dig> hpf, an elaborate vascular system can be detected using the cdh <dig> staining in zebrafish . the majority of the blood vessels seen in control embryos, including the lateral dorsal aorta, dorsal aorta, posterior cardinal vein, hyoid and branchial arch vessels, could also be found in the glo mutant embryos . the intersegmental vessels in the mutant embryos were poorly stained and disorganized compared to those in control embryos . injection of fitc-dextran into anesthetized control embryos resulted in a vasculature labeling pattern similar to cdh <dig> staining in the control embryos , but there was very little fitc-dextran labeling in glo mutant embryos .

discussion
in this study, we show that zebrafish cadherin <dig> is expressed by the myocardium of both the atrium and ventricle during critical periods of zebrafish cardiac development, and that loss of cadherin <dig> function disrupts differentiation of myocardiocytes, normal functioning of the zebrafish heart and formation of the intersegmental vasculature. there are only a few systems  and organisms in which one can readily perform in vivo studies of gene function in cell and tissue differentiation together with measurement of organ physiological performance affected by the loss of the gene function. this study further demonstrates the usefulness of zebrafish as a model organism to study gene function in vertebrate cardiac differentiation and function. the reduced cardiac performance in the glo mutant embryos likely results from altered atrial and ventricular morphology, which in turn is likely caused by the changes in the myocardiocyte differentiation.

pericardial and cardiac gross morphology is greatly altered in cadherin <dig> morphants and glo mutant embryos
our finding that the pericardial cavity was greatly enlarged in the vast majority of the cadherin <dig> morphants and in all glo mutants suggests that cadherin <dig> function could be required for developing a normal pericardial cavity. however, it cannot be ruled out that altered kidney function could be causing pericardial enlargement via fluid accumulation. thus, the actual cause for the formation of such an enlarged pericardial cavity, likely due to an accumulation of fluid in the cavity, in these embryos is unclear. it may have more to do with the much-weakened cardiac function in the mutant embryos than the development of the vascular system. this idea is supported by our finding that most of the major blood vessels were present in the glo mutant embryos, but there was little labeling of the blood vessels using the fitc-dextran injection .

enlarged pericardial cavity was reported in cadherin <dig> mutant mice  <cit> , but not seen in the pac mutants  <cit> . this difference likely results from different degrees of knockdown/knockout of cadherin <dig> function in these mutants. it is possible that a small amount of functional cadherin <dig> protein is produced in the pac mutants due to alternative splicing  <cit> , therefore defects in the pac mutants are not as severe as in the glo mutants.

the gross morphological defects observed in the glo mutant hearts are likely caused by changes in the morphology of individual myocardiocytes. although defects in the myocardiocytes were observed in both glo and pac mutant embryos, the gross cardiac morphological defects were obvious only in the former. this again, is likely due to differences in the degree of cadherin <dig> function disruption, with a complete loss of cadherin <dig> function in the glo mutant embryos, while perhaps some cadherin <dig> function remaining in the pac mutant embryos . the enlarged pericardial cavity is unlikely one of the major causes of the atrial and ventricular disorganization, because the gross morphological defects can be detected at  <dig> hpf, when there is no obvious change in the size of the pericardial cavity.

cadherin <dig> plays an important role in myocardiocyte differentiation, cardiac morphogenesis and performance
during cardiac development, myocardiocytes express cardiac specific markers such as nkx <dig> , cmlc <dig>  vmhc and cdh <dig> <cit> . despite greatly altered gross cardiac morphology and myocardiocytes morphology in glo mutant embryos, expression of nkx <dig> , cmlc <dig> and cdh <dig> is largely unchanged, suggesting that cadherin <dig> is not required for normal expression of these genes. however, expression of vmhc, a ventricle specific gene, in the glo mutant heart is reduced compared to control embryos. although vmhc role in cardiac formation and function has not being studied in vertebrates, loss of function in an atrium specific myosin heavy chain has been linked to disruption in atrial function and altered ventricular morphogenesis in zebrafish  <cit> , suggesting that vmhc may play a similar role in ventricular myocardiocyte differentiation and function. therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that cadherin <dig> function in vertebrate cardiac development and the function may be mediated, at least partially, by its effect on vmhc expression.

myocardiocytes undergo extensive morphological changes during cardiac morphogenesis  <cit> . for example, cuboidal shaped chicken myocardiocytes become flattened and tightly associated when the heart begins to contract, and the myocardiocytes become fusiform shaped and arranged in the circumferential direction during looping  <cit> , similar to the zebrafish myocardiocytes . many myocardiocytes in the glo mutant become round shaped and lack tight association, which may have contributed to poor electrical conduction between cells, thus reducing the contraction rate shown in glo mutant embryos. this also may have contributed to the gross cardiac morphological defects including the disrupted heart looping observed in both the cadherin <dig> mutant mice  <cit>  and glo mutant embryos.

the loss of cadherin <dig> function does not affect all aspects of myocardiocyte differentiation because myocardiocytes in the cadherin <dig> mutant mice and glo mutant embryos still contract and/or express cardiac specific genes . other cell adhesion molecules such as n-cam and other cadherin molecules may still function in these animals. although most of the blood vessels were present as indicated by cdh <dig> labeling, it is unclear whether or not these cdh5-positive vessels were normal. as was shown in the heart, cdh <dig> staining in the glo mutants was similar to controls. it is not surprising that the formation of the major trunk vessels is not greatly affected in the glo mutant embryos, since the zebrafish vasculature system express cdh <dig>  instead of cadherin <dig>  it is possible that there are defects on those blood vessels, but we have no other markers  to assess their integrity. additionally, the intersegmental vessels and all other vessels formed via angiogenic remodeling are poorly formed or not present in glo mutant embryos. this is likely a proximal effect of the lack of pressure and flow generated by the glo mutant embryo heart, and/or due to cadherin <dig> function on the trunk and tail muscle development  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that cadherin <dig> plays an essential role in zebrafish cardiovascular development. although the exact mechanisms remain unknown as to the formation of the enlarged pericardium and reduced peripheral blood flow, it is clear that myocardiocyte  differentiation and physiological performance is impaired.
