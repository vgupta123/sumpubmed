BACKGROUND
a major challenge in modern agriculture is to produce enough food with limited arable land to meet the demand from an ever-growing world population  <cit> . one effective practice is to increase the crop planting density in order to enhance the yield on a per area unit basis, which has been successfully employed in maize production  <cit> . a key determinant of the optimum planting density of field-grown maize is its response to shade. at dense stands, maize perceives the shade mainly as a decrease in the red :far-red  light ratio caused by the depletion of photosynthetically active radiation  by neighboring plants. such a signal serves as a warning of forthcoming competition from neighbors and triggers a number of physiological alterations of maize plants for them to outgrow their competitors, including reallocation of resources into stem elongation from other organs; longer leaves; lowered mechanical strength of stems; elevated ear height; higher lodging rate; early flowering and senescence; reduced photosynthesis efficiency and grain filling; and also active suppression of defense responses against pathogens and herbivores . the above-mentioned phenomena, collectively known as the shade avoidance response , is detrimental to the grain yield of maize as plant density increases.

the molecular components and genetic network controlling sar have been extensively studied in the dicot model species arabidopsis  <cit> . the arabidopsis genome encodes five phytochromes  serving as photoreceptors for r and fr light. among them phyb plays a major role in shade detection  <cit> . phytochromes exist in two photo-convertible isoforms: r light triggers the photoconversion of phytochromes from their inactive pr form to the active pfr form, while fr light photoconverts the pfr form back to the pr form. the pfr form of phytochormes translocates into the nucleus to trigger genome-wide transcriptional changes and subsequent photo-responses. shade reduces the pfr:pr ratio, and also the nuclear accumulation, of phyb, leading to the accumulation of the e <dig> ligase constitutive photomorphogenic <dig>  in the nucleus  <cit>  and enhanced 26s proteasome-mediated degradation of several transcription factors, including elongated hypocotyl <dig> , hy5-homolog , long hypocotyl in far-red <dig> , and long after far-red light <dig>  . recent progress showed that phytochromes could function as transcriptional regulators by interacting directly with numerous transcription factors on the promoters of target genes, conferring rapid responses to light signals  <cit> . more importantly, phytochromes suppress the shade response by antagonizing a group of bhlh transcription factors termed phytochrome-interacting factors . shade induces the dephosphorylation and activation of pif <dig> and also promotes the protein stability of other pifs  as the result of deactivation of phyb . pifs regulate nearly all physiological aspects of sar, such as flowering and auxin-dependent elongated growth . shade also swiftly induces the transcript abundance of a number of transcription factors in arabidopsis, including a group of homeobox genes  and bhlh family members , which act as either positive  or negative  regulators to fine-tune the progress of sar .

although the genetic and regulatory networks controlling sar has been extensively studied in arabidopsis, these are far less well defined in monocots, including maize  <cit> . maize as well as all other monocots only has three types of phytochromes   <cit> . similar to arabidopsis, the maize sar is largely mediated by phyb, and the two copies of phyb  derived from an ancient tetraploidization event contributes differently to distinct physiological aspects of sar, indicating both redundancy and sub-functionalization of phyb activities  <cit> . dramatic physiological and morphological variations of shade response have been observed in natural populations of maize, and modern maize varieties are generally associated with enhanced shade tolerance under high-density planting conditions  <cit> , thus attenuated sar might have been historically selected by maize breeders for adaptation to high density planting  <cit> . a number of domestication genes controlling important agronomic traits have been cloned in maize, such as teosinte branched <dig>  and teosinte glume architecture <dig>   <cit> , but none has been identified to regulate sar hitherto. it is highly likely that the improved shade response in modern maize is a relatively complex trait collectively controlled by multiple loci, considering the complexity of the regulatory network of sar in arabidopsis. despite a lack of comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture of sar in maize and many other crop species, there has been significant interest in modifying photoperception for crop improvement. for example, overexpression or targeted modification of phya or phyb has been used to improve plant architecture and increase yield in densely planted crops . other master regulators of shade response downstream of phytochromes such as pifs, however, have not been utilized as targets in crop sar engineering.

to improve maize sar more efficiently, either by molecular engineering or traditional breeding methods, it is necessary to achieve a mechanistic understanding of the molecular components and regulatory networks controlling maize sar  <cit> . here, the maize sar controlled by phyb signaling, and also the frc-mediated de-etiolation controlled by phya signaling, was examined by time-series genome-wide expression profilling. the shade avoidance transcript profile significantly overlapped with that in de-etiolation, with contrasting directions of expression regulation for most overlapping differentially regulated genes in the two experiments. enrichment analysis of cis-elements on light-responsive gene promoters identified binding sites for tfs involved in various signaling pathways that cross-talk with phytochrome signaling. co-expression network analysis identified two transcription factor modules each functioning in sar and de-etiolation, and may serve as regulatory hubs in each process. a cross-species comparison of the shade transcriptome between maize and arabidopsis identified both conserved and divergent patterns of expression regulation on various biological processes such as flowering and elongated growth. moreover, it was found that the two subgenomes of maize differentially retained shade/de-etiolation-responsive genes and cis-elements, indicating fractionation of the two subgenomes in light-signaling. this study will be helpful for future functional genomics investigation of maize adaptation to heavily shaded field conditions.

RESULTS
the simulated shade environment
genome-wide transcriptional dynamics of the shade avoidance response  has been extensively studied in the model dicot arabidopsis , but less well defined in economically important monocots. this study aimed to dissect the regulatory network controlling the maize sar, a process believed to be attenuated by intense artificial selection during domestication and breeding to avoid the adverse effects of sar under densely planted field conditions  <cit> . a simulated shade condition identical to that used before in arabidopsis  <cit>  was adopted to facilitate direct comparison between the two species . maize seedlings grown under the simulated shade condition displayed phenotypes characteristic of sar, including elongated leaves and less anthocyanin accumulation, compared to those grown under high r/fr , indicating the validity of such an experimental condition.fig.  <dig> dynamic progression of maize transcriptome in sar and frc-mediated de-etiolation. a a schematic representation of the light treatments used in this study. b shared and unique dtgs in sar and de-etiolation. note that most overlapping dtgs were regulated in opposite directions in the two experiments. c the number of dtgs at various time points in sar and de-etiolation. d the expression profiles of  <dig> gene clusters identified from  <dig> dtgs by k-means clustering. e functional category enrichment  among the  <dig> clusters



dynamic transcriptional reprogramming in the maize shade avoidance response
to analyze the dynamics of the sar at a genome-wide scale, global gene expression profiles upon 1 h, 3 h and 6 h exposure to low r/fr were inspected. a transcriptional profiling on maize de-etiolation under frc was also conducted , a process sharing common regulatory components with sar  <cit> . principal component analysis  showed high degree of reproducibility among biological replicates within each group . a total of  <dig> genes were identified as differentially regulated in response to the simulated shade within 6 h , with  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes. comparable numbers of dtgs were found in fr-mediated de-etiolation, with  <dig> genes up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated . due to the partial overlap between the two dtg sets, in total  <dig> early-responsive dtgs in response to shade and/or fr were observed, representing  <dig>  % of the maize transcriptome . validation of the expression levels of  <dig> genes by qrt-pcr showed a high correlation  between rna-seq and qrt-pcr .

the number of dtgs increased with different dynamics in the two experiments. most dtgs occurred between 3 h and 6 h in sar, but between 1 h and 3 h in de-etiolation, suggesting faster responses of maize transcriptome in de-etiolation . there was only a limited overlap between shade- and fr-responsive gene sets , and most common dtgs  were regulated in opposite directions in sar and de-etiolation . in agreement with this, there was a negative correlation in the expression pattern of these  <dig> common dtgs between sar and de-etiolation, with pearson correlation coefficients of − <dig> , − <dig>  and − <dig>  for 1 h vs. 0 h, 3 h vs.0 h, and 6 h vs. 0 h, respectively. genes with such expression patterns were also reported in arabidopsis  <cit> . such phenomenon is expected since according to the model established in arabidopsis, sar and fr-mediated de-etiolation are initiated mainly by inactivation of phyb and activation of phya, respectively, and these two classes of phytochromes share overlapping downstream signaling cascades  <cit> . therefore, dtgs regulated in opposite directions are likely primary targets downstream of phytochromes. in support of this notion, the aforementioned negative correlation weakened with time, indicating a gradual increase of secondary effects downstream of phytochrome signaling cascades.

to gain an insight into the biological processes involved in maize sar and de-etiolation, the  <dig> dtgs were grouped using the k-means clustering algorithm embedded in mapman  <cit> , and  <dig> gene clusters  were identified . all clusters showed enrichment for one or more mapman bins  . for example, genes involved in photosynthesis, major and minor cho metabolism, glycolysis, transcriptional regulation and protein folding were enriched in k <dig>  which contained shade-repressed genes. notably, the k <dig> cluster, which represents genes that were highly induced by shade and therefore of particular interest, were enriched for genes unassigned with any functions. it was caused by the fact that all the  <dig> genes in k <dig> do not have functionally characterized orthologs in other organisms except two orthologs of arabidopsis flavin-binding, kelch repeat, f-box <dig>  . during fr-mediated de-etiolation, early-induced genes  and late-induced genes  showed differential enrichment of mapman bins. although they were both enriched for genes involved in light signaling and hormone metabolism, k <dig> was particularly enriched with transcription factors while k <dig> was enriched for genes of phenylpropanoid and flavonoid metabolism pathways, suggesting the importance of transcription factors as early primary targets of phya signaling in maize.fig.  <dig> enriched cis-elements in each dtg cluster. for each dtg cluster, the genomic regions from 2 kb upstream to  <dig>  kb downstream of the transcription start site were assessed for their over-representation of plant cis-elements



differentially enriched cis-elements in distinctly light-regulated gene clusters
genes with similar expression patterns are likely to share common regulatory cis-elements in their promoters, thus the enrichment of cis-elements for each dtg cluster was analyzed. this led to the identification of a total of  <dig> cis-elements enriched in at least one dtg cluster . cis-elements enriched in more than  <dig> clusters or with functions associated with light signaling were shown in fig.  <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig> represent shade-induced dtgs . one striking common feature of them is significant enrichment of i-box, the evening element, cca <dig> binding site, and the light-responsive gata motif. in addition, the k <dig> genes, which were most highly induced by shade, were enriched with the binding sites for a group of hb transcription factors, including hb1/5/ <dig> and arr <dig>  consistent with the finding in arabidopsis that hb family members were among the early shade-induced genes  <cit> . notably, several enriched motifs for k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig> genes, such as the light-responsive gata motif, arr <dig> binding site and gcbox, were not enriched on the promoters of shade-responsive arabidopsis genes  <cit> , suggestive of the unique functions of corresponding transcription factors in maize sar. k <dig> and k <dig> genes, which represent early and late frc-induced dtgs, respectively, were enriched with g-box motifs, especially binding sites for myc2/3/ <dig>  implying a potential role of ja pathway components in fr-mediated de-etiolation. in addition to the binding sites of myc2/3/ <dig>  cis-elements related to various other hormone pathways were found enriched in the dtg set, such as those related to auxin , ga  and br  , suggesting combinatorial complexity of these cis-elements together with light-regulated cis-elements on the transcriptional regulation of target genes. to investigate whether functionally related cis-elements might have similar enrichment patterns, cis-elements were hierarchically clustered based on their pattern of enrichment across all dtg clusters . transcription factor binding motifs with similar sequences tend to group together, such as pil5/bzr <dig> and pifs/mycs. it was reported that over half of pil <dig> target genes are also targets of bzr <dig>  <cit> , but the integration of other transcription factors on light controlled promoters still awaits further investigation. despite the abundance of g-box like elements in this analysis, enrichment of hy <dig> binding sites was not observed in any dtg cluster, consistent with the fact that hy <dig> transcript abundance was not significantly altered during sar in this study. in arabidopsis, hy <dig> was initially considered to play no roles in sar under simulated shade conditions  <cit> . but it was later found that hy <dig> was late induced by shade, and hy <dig> binding sites were weakly enriched in shade-responsive genes after prolonged  shade treatment  <cit> . and two recent studies identified hy <dig> as a repressor of sar when a sunfleck interrupts shade light on a daily basis  <cit>  and controls hypocotyl and leaf morphology in response to shade  <cit> . a lack of hy <dig> binding site enrichment in this dataset suggests a limited role of hy <dig> in the early signaling events of sar in maize, or distinct recognition sites of maize hy <dig> compared to arabidopsis hy <dig> 

changing inventories of transcription factors in sar and de-etiolation
most functionally characterized domesticated genes are transcription factors  <cit> , and it was suggested that maize sar has been targets of domestication in order for maize to adapt to the high-density stands in modern field conditions  <cit> . thus special attention was paid to tfs that are transcriptionally regulated, and are therefore potentially involved, in sar. to identify tfs in our dtg sets, dtgs with homology to known tfs were combined with information from the grassius database, followed by manual removal of mis-annotated genes in grassius . among the  <dig> shade-responsive dtgs,  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated differentially transcribed tfs  were identified. a larger proportion of dtgs in de-etiolation was identified as transcription factors  , but this set of dttfs only shared limited overlap with that of sar. more dttfs were regulated in opposite directions than those regulated in the same direction in sar and de-etiolation, a scenario also observed for dtgs . interestingly, in contrast to the previous report that over  <dig> arabidopsis tfs displayed over two fold induction or repression within 1 h of shade treatment, only  <dig> up-regulated tfs were found in maize at 1 h of the same treatment, including zmhb <dig> , zmlbd <dig> , zmmybr <dig> , a regulator of epidermal cell differentiation and nitrate signaling  <cit> ), and zmglk <dig> . nevertheless, maize tfs responded to fr rather swiftly:  <dig> up-regulated and one down-regulated transcription factors were identified from the  <dig> early-responsive dtgs at 1 h fr treatment . this is comparable to the scenario in arabidopsis, in which over 30 % of the early-responsive genes in fr-mediated photomorphogenesis were transcription factors, representing a master set of genes that orchestrate the expression of the downstream targets in the phya-directed transcriptional network  <cit> .fig.  <dig> the dynamics of light-regulated dttfs. a the number of dttfs at various time points in sar and de-etiolation. b the venn diagram showing shared and unique dttfs in sar and de-etiolation. c the  <dig> dttfs were clustered into three groups  using the self organization tree algorithm . d distribution of tf familys among the three groups of tfs. the number of genes in each family is shown. e representative functions and tfs differentially regulated in response to shade. tfs shown in red were shade-induced while those in blue were shade-suppressed. for clarity, maize tfs were shown as their arabidopsis orthologs



to detect potential family-specific expression trends, dttfs were clustered using the self organization tree algorithm  based on their expression pattern in sar and de-etiolation, and further categorized into  <dig> groups  . g <dig> and g <dig> represent tfs that were induced or repressed by shade, respectively. some tf family members preferably or exclusively belong to g <dig> and/or g <dig>  such as at hook containing tfs, ap2/erebp, mads, gata, prr, myb, sig and dof. tfs that were non-responsive to shade, but nevertheless fr-inducible, comprised g <dig>  tify and wrky tfs preferentially belong to g <dig>  and are therefore more functionally related to phya signaling during de-etiolation .fig.  <dig> transcription factor modules in sar and frc-mediated de-etiolation. a two densely connected transcription factor groups  each containing  <dig> tfs were identified in the co-expression tf network using the markov cluster algorithm .b a close-up view of the two modules. genes with functionally characterized arabidopsis orthologs were labeled with the names of their arabidopsis counterparts for clarity except zmbhlh <dig>  c gene expression heatmaps of module i in sar and module ii in de-etiolation. d module i and ii in the context of a co-expression network containing all the  <dig> dtgs. tfs were shown in orange. e enriched go terms of first neighbors of module i



homology-based function prediction of dttfs in maize sar showed many biological processes potentially regulated by these dttfs, including light signaling, circadian clock, flowering, stress response, hormone signaling, as well as growth and development . eleven shade-regulated bbx family members were identified, including  <dig> shade-induced  and  <dig> shade-repressed genes . in arabidopsis, bbx <dig> negatively regulates sar  <cit> , while bbx <dig> promotes sar by impairing della activity  <cit> . moreover, bbx <dig> and bbx <dig> promote hypocotyl elongation under a low r/fr ratio  <cit> . the roles of other bbx genes in sar have not been defined, although bbx <dig> and bbx <dig> were identified as positive and negative regulators of photomorphogenesis, respectively  <cit> .

plastid was considered as an important player in light signaling  <cit> , and two putative chloroplast localized sigma factors  were found shade-repressed. siga, but not sige, was also reported as a shade-repressed gene in arabidopsis  <cit> . moreover, arabidopsis siga and sige expression displayed phytochrome-dependent induction by r or fr illumination during de-etiolation, and function as positive and negative regulators of photomorphogenesis, respectively .

tfs with functions in circadian clock and flowering were also among shade regulated dttfs. orthologs of elf <dig>  lux, toc <dig>  and prr <dig> were up-regulated while those of lhy, prr <dig>  rve <dig>  rve <dig> were down-regulated. two dof-type zinc finger genes orthologous to arabidopsis cdf <dig> and cdf <dig> were down-regulated by shade. arabidopsis cdf <dig> and cdf <dig> repress co expression to delay flowering and such repression is antagonized by the gi/fkf <dig> complex  <cit> . interestingly, in addition to the shade-repressed cdf2/ <dig> expression, strong induction of the two gi and two fkf <dig> orthologs in maize in response to shade was observed. therefore, the mechanism of shade-induced early flowering might be conserved between maize and arabidopsis.

shade also influenced many aspects of growth and development in maize. three dttfs potentially involved in nitrogen signaling were identified, including orthologs of arabidopsis tcp <dig>  <cit> , etc <dig>  <cit> , and lbd <dig>  <cit> . notably, etc <dig> and lbd <dig> are two of the four extremely early shade-responsive dttfs , suggesting the importance of nitrogen signaling in early maize sar. other shade-induced up-regulated genes include an ortholog of arabidopsis wrinkled <dig>  which controls biosynthesis of triacylglycerol, an important storage compound  <cit> ; an ortholog of atnac <dig>  which controls sam formation  <cit> ; and an hb <dig> ortholog potentially involved in cell expansion and proliferation. moreover, shade suppressed the expression of zmmyb <dig>  an ortholog of atmyb <dig>  which functions to regulate cell cycle progression  <cit> ; zmmybr <dig>  an ortholog of kua <dig>  which is essential for cell expansion and ros homeostasis  <cit> ; and four single-myb transcription factor genes orthologous to arabidopsis radialis-like sant/myb  <dig>  and rsm <dig>  although rsm <dig> and rsm <dig> have not been functionally studied, rsm <dig> overexpression plants are hypersensitive to red light during de-etiolation, characterized by a shorter hypocotyl than wild type plants  <cit> .

a number of tfs related to stress response were also identified, including the upregulation of two oxidation-related zinc finger  genes orthologous to arabidopsis ozf <dig> and ozf <dig>  positive regulators of the oxidative stress response and salt stress response, respectively  <cit> ; and also zmbzip <dig>  an ortholog of arabidopsis bzip <dig>  which regulates unfolded protein response  in er stress  <cit> . moreover, two ja signaling components were differentially regulated, including up-regulation of a jaz <dig> ortholog and down-regulation of a myc <dig> ortholog.

in arabidopsis, a large number of shade-induced tfs have been identified and functionally characterized, including a group of homeobox genes  and bhlh family members , which function as either positive  or negative  regulators of sar . phylogenetic analysis of homeobox tfs in arabidopsis and maize identified zmhb <dig> and zmhb <dig> as two orthologs of the five shade-induced arabidopsis hb genes, indicating an expansion of this small hb family clade in arabidopsis after its divergence from maize . zmhb <dig> was an extremely early shade-induced gene up-regulated by shade within 1 h, and it was found down-regulated in de-etiolation. zmhb <dig> was unresponsive to any light treatment in this study. arabidopsis par <dig> and par <dig> are two atypical bhlh tfs, and only one maize ortholog was found  . however, this gene was not up-regulated by shade, although its down-regulation in de-etiolation was observed. pifs and pils, together with an atypical bhlh gene hfr <dig>  comprise a small bhlh clade that are crucial components of sar. phylogenetic analysis showed that seven maize bhlh proteins were orthologous to arabidopsis pif1/3/4/ <dig>  all characterized by an n-terminal apb motif responsible for their interaction with phyb . although regulation of pif activity mainly occurs at the protein level in arabidopsis, two light-regulated maize pifs, zmbhlh <dig>  and zmbhlh <dig> , were identified. for hfr <dig>  pil <dig> and pil <dig>  however, no obvious orthologs were detected in maize, suggesting their fast evolution and expansion in arabidopsis or a loss of these tfs in maize.

the dynamics of dttfs during frc-mediated de-etiolation also suggests complex cascades of transcriptional control. interestingly, up-regulation of a number of ja pathway signaling components, including  <dig> jazs,  <dig> myc <dig> ortholog, and  <dig> jam <dig> ortholog, was observed. the integration of phya signaling and ja pathway has been a field of intense investigation  <cit> . myc <dig> functions synergistically with spa <dig> to suppress fr-mediated photomorphogenesis  <cit> . the role of jaz genes in photomorphogenesis is unclear, but jaz <dig> protein was reported to be destablized in frc-mediated de-etiolation and stablized during sar, and ectopic overexpression of jaz <dig> resulted in exaggerated sar  <cit> . in arabidopsis, ja was reported to positively regulate the phenylpropanoid pathway and promote biosynthesis of flavonoids  in a phya-dependent manner  <cit> , and genes involved in phenylpropanoid and flavonoid metabolism were enriched in k <dig>  k <dig> and k <dig>  clusters containing fr-induced genes in de-etiolation . consistently, several tfs involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were induced during de-etiolation, including the maize r1/colored  <dig> gene orthologous to arabidopsis glabrous  <dig> , a maize ortholog of arabidopsis iaa26/phytochrome-associated protein <dig> , three orthologs of hy <dig>  and zmmyb40/zmmyb-if <dig>  an ortholog of arabidopsis myb <dig>  in arabidopsis, pap <dig> is a phytochrome interacting protein and regulates phya-induced chalcone synthase  expression through hy <dig>  zmmyb-if <dig> has not been functionally characterized, but its ortholog myb <dig> is a transcriptional activator of chs, flavanone 3-hydroxylase , flavonol synthase  and chalcone flavanone isomerase   <cit> . in arabidopsis, the promotion of myb <dig> expression is dependent on hy <dig>  <cit> , consistent with the role of hy <dig> as a positive regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis  <cit> . it’s still unknown whether the hy5-myb <dig> axis is conserved in maize, despite the up-regulation of both hy <dig> and myb <dig> orthologs during de-etiolation in our dataset.

co-expression analysis shows possible modularized regulatory hubs in sar and de-etiolation
to identify co-regulated transcription factor modules that may function as core regulators of maize light signaling, a co-expression correlation network was constructed according to pearson correlation values between tfs, and densely connected tfs  were identified using the markov cluster algorithm  . two modules were identified at a cut-off of  <dig> for node numbers, and they were found each involved in sar and de-etiolation . module i consists of  <dig> tfs whose expression levels gradually decreased throughout the shade treatment, including four bbx genes, three orthologs of arabidopsis lhy, two sigma factors, as well as orthologs of arabidopsis pif <dig>  myc <dig>  rl <dig>  and ofp6; module ii contains  <dig> tfs that are early-induced  during frc-mediated de-etiolation, but the inductive effect of frc on these tfs was later alleviated. interestingly, most of them have been implicated in stress responses, such as several ja-pathway components , and also orthologs of arabidopsis wrky <dig>  zat <dig>  ataf <dig>  bhlh <dig>  all involved in defense response to biotic and/or abiotic stresses .

co-regulated genes may function in concert in specific biological processes, making it possible to divulge the biological functions of the above mentioned tf modules by placing them in the context of a genome-wide co-expression network. the co-expression analysis was extended to all  <dig> dtgs identified in this study . to identify biological processes most closely linked to tf modules, the modules were considered as single nodes in the graph and their first neighbors were subjected to go enrichment analysis. ninety-three first neighbors of module i were enriched with diverse go terms including “plastid”, “photosynthesis”, terms related to primary and secondary metabolism , as well as terms involved in responses to environment changes , suggesting that module i tfs play regulatory roles in these processes . the module ii, however, appeared rather isolated in the co-expression network, and only harbors two first neighbors: grmzm2g <dig>  and grmzm2g <dig> . the scarcity of first neighbors was probably due to the fact that module ii tfs responded to frc much faster than most other genes, leading to relatively low correlation coefficients between these tfs and other genes. the role of ga2ox genes in de-etiolation has been reported in pisum sativum, in which hy <dig> positively regulates the ga catabolism gene ga2ox <dig> to reduce the levels of active gas and suppress the elongated growth in skotomorphogenesis  <cit> . the maize ga2ox <dig> gene is another ga catabolism gene, and the maize hy <dig> gene in module ii possibly up-regulated the ga2ox <dig> gene expression. moreover, although hy <dig> was largely regulated at the protein level, up-regulation of maize hy <dig> expression during de-etiolation was observed.

cross-species comparison of transcriptional profiles in sar identifies auxin biosynthesis as a potential target of maize domestication
although monocots and dicots have split around 140 ~  <dig> million years ago, they share a number of common morphological and physiological responses in their shade avoidance syndrome, such as elongated growth and accelerated flowering. thus we compared shared patterns of expression across all orthologous maize-arabidopsis gene pairs in response to shade. putative orthologs of shade-responsive maize genes in arabidopsis were obtained from the gramene database, and their expression patterns under shade were retrieved from two previous studies  <cit> .  <dig> of the  <dig> shade-induced maize genes have orthologs in arabidopsis. among these  <dig> maize genes,  <dig> have orthologous arabidopsis genes that are also induced by shade.  <dig> out of  <dig> shade-repressed maize genes have their orthologous counterparts in arabidopsis. however, only  <dig> of these maize genes have arabidopsis orthologs that are shade-repressed . these results indicate that the regulation of shade-induced genes is more conserved than that of shade-repressed genes. interestingly,  <dig> orthologous gene pairs displayed contrasting expression patterns in response to shade, suggesting that the biological processes controlled by these genes may be distinctly regulated in maize and arabidopsis during sar .

special attention was paid to genes controlling elongated growth and accelerated flowering, two hallmarks of sar. two flowering promoting genes, gi and ft, were shade-induced in both species . in arabidopsis, gi and fkf <dig> promote the co/ft module activity by multiple mechanisms  . although fkf <dig> was not a shade-induced gene in arabidopsis, strong shade induction of the two fkf <dig> orthologs in maize was observed . shade also repressed the expression of two maize cdfs, which are suppressed by fkf <dig> and negatively regulate co expression in arabidopsis. these results suggested a conserved gi/fkf1-co/ft axis promoting flowering in sar, although the regulation of fkf <dig> and cdfs may have distinct mechanisms in the two species.fig.  <dig> a cross-species comparison of the regulatory circuits controlling flowering and elongation in sar between arabidopsis and maize. a in arabidopsis, the fkf1-gi module positively regulates the co/ft module activity and flowering by multiple mechanisms. the fkf1/gi complex directly promotes co expression on the co promoter. fkf <dig> also directly enhances co protein stability, or suppresses cdf transcription factors  to alleviate their repressive effect on co expression. moreover, gi was reported to directly promote ft expression. the arabidopsis gi was reported to be a shade-inducible gene. in maize shade response, however, up-regulation of fkf <dig> in addition to gi and also the down-regulation of two cdfs were observed. b a recently revised model of auxin biosynthesis placed yuccas downstream of taa <dig>  with yuccas as the rate-limiting enzymes. in arabidopsis, shade leads to strong induction of yuccas and a slight down-regulation of taa <dig>  resulting in excessive biosynthesis of auxin and elongated growth under shade. in maize, however, only a mild up-regulation of taa <dig> and no obvious alterations in yucca expression were observed



elongated growth is another hallmark of sar. in arabidopsis, this is achieved by shade-induced rapid biosynthesis of auxin dependent on tryptophan aminotransferase of arabidopsis  <dig>   <cit>  and yucca genes  <cit> . a recently revised model of auxin biosynthesis pathway placed yucca genes downstream of taa <dig>  <cit> . in arabidopsis, shade strongly induces yuccas but also exerts a weak suppression effect on taa <dig> expression  <cit> . as yuccas catalyze the rate-limiting step, the biosynthesis of auxin is strongly enhanced in response to shade. in maize, although up-regulation of a taa <dig> ortholog was observed, the expression of yucca genes was not obviously altered . furthermore, in contrast to the previous report that shade-responsive genes in arabidopsis were particularly enriched with the go term “response to auxin stimulus”  <cit> , this and other auxin-related go terms were not enriched in shade-responsive maize genes , consistent with the distinct regulatory patterns of auxin biosynthetic genes in the two species. it is possible that the unresponsiveness of yuccas to shade is due to artificial selection for attenuated sar in maize, but confirmation of such a hypothesis still awaits further investigation of yucca expression patterns in the undomesticated ancestors of maize.

biased distribution of dtgs toward maize <dig> is associated with fractionation of cis-elements between the two maize subgenomes
an ancient tetraploidy event 5– <dig> million years ago gave rise to the two subgenomes of maize, with the maize <dig> subgenome experiencing less gene loss and displaying generally higher levels of gene expression compared to maize <dig>  <cit> , but it’s still unknown whether the two subgenomes respond to environmental stimuli differently. to study the response of the two subgenomes in sar and de-etiolation, the distribution of dtgs in the two subgenomes was investigated.  <dig> and  <dig> dtgs in sar could be unambiguously assigned to maize <dig> and maize <dig>  respectively, indicating more dynamic transcriptomic changes in maize <dig>  . in each subgenome, induced or repressed dtgs were categorized according to their counterparts  in the other subgenome: 1) counterpart not differentially expressed; 2) counterpart with a similar induction/repression pattern; or 3) counterpart lost after tetraploidy . the number of genes falling into the second group should be equal between the two subgenomes. genes in the third group in maize <dig> outnumbered those in maize <dig>  which is expected since maize <dig> suffered from more severe gene loss than maize <dig>  interestingly, distribution of the first group genes significantly biased toward maize <dig>  for both up- and down-regulated dtgs. similar gene distribution was also observed for de-etiolation under frc . in sum, the higher responsiveness to shade/de-etiolation for maize <dig> is due to both higher gene retention rate in maize <dig>  and also higher retention rate of light-responsiveness in existing genes.fig.  <dig> fraction of the two maize subgenomes in sar and de-etiolation. a shade-induced and shade-repressed genes unambiguously assigned to the two subgenomes of maize were each categorized into three groups according to the expression patterns and presence/absence of their counters in the other subgenome. b the same analysis as in  on dtgs in frc-mediated de-etiolation



the reduced responsiveness of maize <dig> to light stimuli might be indicative of fractionation of light-regulated cis-elements between the two subgenomes. to test this hypothesis, it was investigated whether cis-elements enriched in our dtg sets were differentially retained in maize1-maize <dig> gene pairs. a “shade-induced gene pair” was defined as a pair of homologs each belonging to a subgenome, with at least one of them shade-induced. enrichment of cis-elements was evaluated separately for maize <dig> and maize <dig> members of all “shade-induced gene pairs”. as shown in table  <dig>  distribution of  <dig> cis-elements were found strongly biased toward maize <dig>  including the evening element , fus <dig> binding site, and sorlrep <dig>  the strongest bias was observed for ee, indicating a significant loss of ee in maize <dig>  in de-etiolation, enrichment of z-box, agl <dig> binding site, abre-like binding site, pif <dig> binding site, and bzr <dig> binding site was significantly biased toward maize <dig>  interestingly, enhanced enrichment of several cis-elements in maize <dig> was also observed, such as the cdc <dig> binding site in shade-induced gene pairs and the cca <dig> binding site in fr-induced gene pairs, suggesting that these cis-elements were not involved in gene-induction in this study, or that they function to suppress gene-induction in sar and de-etiolation, respectively. differential distribution of cis-elements was also found for shade-suppressed and fr-suppressed genes . taken together, these results indicated that fractionation of cis-elements contributed to the differential responses of the two subgenomes of maize to light signals.table  <dig> biased retention of cis-elements enriched in light-responsive genes between maize <dig> and maize2

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, maize sar and frc-mediated de-etiolation was transcriptionally profiled, leading to the identification of important biological processes and cis-elements involved in the response to the two treatments. co-expression network analysis identified transcription factor modules that may serve as pivotal regulators in sar and de-etiolation. cross-species comparison of transcriptional regulation in sar between arabidopsis and maize identified shade-induced auxin biosynthesis as a possible target of domestication. moreover, it was found that the distribution of shade- and fr-responsive genes was biased toward the maize <dig> subgenome, and this was associated with differential retention of light-responsive cis-elements between the two subgenomes, indicating that genome fractionation can occur both on genes and non-coding sequences with regulatory functions.
