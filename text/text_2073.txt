BACKGROUND
microsatellite genetic markers are based on the properties of ssrs  which are numerous and ubiquitous in the dna of eukaryotes  <cit> . the basic repeat unit of an ssr is generally considered to be one to six bases long, and an array of two or more basic units repeated in tandem constitutes the ssr. such ssrs are often miscopied by dna polymerase, and the resulting high mutation rate, leading to a change in the number of basic units in the array, has proven to be very useful for population genetic studies. the high degree of polymorphism in the size of the tandem array can easily be visualized by gel-separation of pcr products generated by primers placed in the flanking regions, on either side of the ssr.

another pattern of repetition, however, has proven to be very troublesome in the practical application of microsatellite markers in some organisms, including the insect order lepidoptera . the regions closely flanking one or both sides of the ssr may themselves be highly repeated, dispersed throughout the genome rather than occurring tandemly  <cit> . primers designed to match these regions, therefore, may generate multiple bands, or even fail to produce discrete visible products because too many different sites are being amplified. unlike the internally-repeated patterns of the ssrs, there is nothing obvious about the structure of these repeated flanking regions. the fact that they are repeated can be deduced only by comparisons among many flanking sequences, not by any intrinsic pattern of the sequence itself.

meglécz et al.  <cit>  first described families of similar sequences flanking ssr repeats from two species of lepidoptera, parnassius apollo and euphydryas aurinia. these similarity patterns fall into two main types, if the location of the ssr is taken into account but its sequence and orientation is ignored. unilateral repeat families occur on one side only of the ssr, the other side is not repeated . in bilateral repeat families, both flanking sides are repeated . van't hof et al.  <cit>  denoted these as asymmetric and symmetric families respectively, however these terms are misleading as there is not necessarily any symmetry between l <dig> and r <dig>  l <dig> and r <dig>  etc. these authors examined patterns of flanking ssr families in a third lepidopteran, bicyclus anynana. using blastn comparisons of these to sequences in genbank, they defined four "lepidoptera specific core sequences"  that represented the common elements of four repeated flanking sequences.

the widespread occurrence of these lscs regions can complicate the use of microsatellite markers in population studies. for example, markers have been developed for the polyphagous noctuid moth helicoverpa armigera by several groups  <cit> . markers developed for populations of one region  typically have a low success rate in other regions . studies of australian populations, even using microsatellites developed from those populations, have produced a highly dynamic picture of temporal variation in migration patterns  <cit> . however, a careful re-examination of ten of these markers by endersby et al.  <cit>  showed that a high proportion of these loci showed allele drop-outs or were not in hardy-weinberg equilibrium, undermining their reliability as accurate indicators of population structure.

based on analysis of whole-genome sequences of several insects, including the lepidopteran bombyx mori, meglécz et al.  <cit>  showed there were large interspecific differences in frequencies of microsatellites in insect genomes. they confirmed and extended the observations of shared flanking regions among independently isolated sets of microsatellite markers from several different lepidoptera. they demonstrated a statistical association between ssrs and previously compiled datasets of repeated dna sequences in six drosophila species and anopheles gambiae . van't hof et al.  <cit>  also suggested a general association between transposable elements  and some of the lscs regions. however, no specific class of tes was identified as contributing to the observed patterns.

here we show that a class of non-ltr retrotransposons, rte elements, are associated with ssr repeats in lepidoptera and other species. full-length autonomous elements have low copy numbers in the genome of bombyx mori, however partial elements consisting of the coding sequence of the c-terminal end of the reverse transcriptase protein immediately flanking an ssr are highly abundant. slippage during reverse transcription and chromosomal integration can increase the number of repeating units within the ssr. these numerous chromosomal integration events of partial elements have peppered the genome with ready-made ssrs flanking an element-specific sequence. these events can account for a substantial fraction of unilateral repeat families recovered in independent efforts from several lepidopteran species.

RESULTS
identification of full-length rte elements from lepidoptera
the founding member of the rte clade is the rte- <dig> element from caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . we used its deduced protein sequence  in tblastn searches of lepidopteran sequences in genbank . a full-length element that we have named hmrte-e <dig> sharing all the major features of rte elements was identified in bac clone aehm-22c <dig> from heliconius melpomene  . the single open reading frame  of  <dig> amino acids contains two conserved domains, an ap  endonuclease domain and an rt  domain. unlike some rte elements, no skipped stop codons or frameshifts are evident at the 5' end of the coding sequence. the ap endonuclease domain belongs to a family of proteins  that includes magnesium dependent endonucleases as well as phosphatases involved in intracellular signalling. the rt domain belongs to a family of proteins found in non-ltr retrotransposons and retroviruses  with activities that include rna-directed dna polymerase, dna-directed dna polymerase and a ribonuclease that degrades the rna in a rna:dna duplex , although no rnase h domain was found in this element. these rts catalyze the conversion of single-stranded rna into double-stranded dna for integration into the host chromosomes. the 3' stop codon  is immediately followed by a short  <dig> bp 3'utr containing a 2ct ssr repeat. a  <dig> bp target-site duplication  sequence  immediately follows the 2ct repeat units and also occurs at the 5' end of the element prior to the 5'utr. the tsd sequences are produced when a staggered cut is made in the double-stranded dna prior to element insertion, and the two single-stranded regions flanking the new insert are filled in by dna polymerase  <cit> . the  <dig> bp tsd sequence can be more easily identified through pairwise sequence alignment between the aehm-22c <dig> bac clone  and the homologous bac clone aehm-7g <dig>  that lacks the rte insertion. the comparison of these two bac clones from the same population of h. melpomene offers a rare opportunity to observe the pre- and post-insertion status of the same genomic region. in the bac clone aehm-7g <dig> the pre-insertion position of the hmrte-e <dig> element is between nucleotide positions  <dig>  and  <dig> , and the  <dig> bp sequence at  <dig>  to  <dig>  has become the tsd on both sides of the element in aehm-22c <dig>  the insertion appears to be recent, as frameshifts and internal stop codons commonly found in other rte elements have not accumulated, and the population is polymorphic for presence/absence of the element in this genomic locus.

the c. elegans rte- <dig> sequence was also used to identify  <dig> full-length elements from the unannotated whole-genome shotgun contigs of b. mori , the largest number of distinct rte elements identified from a single species to date. these have the same two conserved protein domains ap and rt, possess various ssr repeats in the short 3' utr immediately following the stop codon at the end of the rt domain, and are flanked by tsd sequences of differing lengths. some of the bombyx elements possess an in-frame stop codon or a frameshift within the first  <dig> bases of the coding sequence, like other rte elements. the partial rte sequence identified by malik and eickbush  <cit>  next to the cecropin b gene of b. mori is represented by the full-length element bmrte-d <dig>  with some protein sequence differences because of attempts of those authors to correct frameshifts that had been identified in the partial sequence. three partial rte sequences identified by zupunski et al.  <cit>  correspond to the full-length elements bmrte-d <dig>  -d <dig>  and -d <dig>  using the full-length bombyx rte elements as query sequences in blast searches of the bombyx genome contigs yields far more hits of various lengths at the 3' end than at the 5' end, suggesting that the copy number of full-length functional autonomous elements is generally low , in contrast to frequent insertions  of partial non-autonomous elements with intact 3' ends and flanking ssrs.

relation of lepidopteran rte elements to other non-ltr retrotransposons
a phylogenetic analysis of the lepidopteran rte elements based on alignment against  <dig> amino acid residues of the rt domain  was conducted in comparison with other rte elements and more generally, other clades of non-ltr retrotransposons . we follow the definition of "clade" used by malik et al.  <cit>  to represent those retroelements that  share the same structural features,  are grouped together with ample phylogenetic support, and  date back to the precambrian era. previously analyzed non-ltr retrotransposons  <cit>  and the b. mori cr <dig> non-ltr element within the cr <dig> clade  <cit>  were included, with members within the cre clade  as outgroups. all of the lepidopteran rte elements cluster together with previously identified rte elements  into a single group with a bootstrap value of 85%, placing these newly described lepidopteran elements within the rte clade  <cit> . two major sister groups are evident, consistent with previous analysis  <cit> , one containing rte- <dig> and rte- <dig> from c. elegans and the other jam <dig> from the mosquito aedes aegypti and bddf from the cow bos taurus. a third minor sister group with a more basal position contained three b. mori elements  and the h. melpomene element hmrte-e <dig> 

we extended previous phylogenetic analyses of the rte subgroups using newly identified fish, molluscan, cnidarian, lizard, amphioxus and plant rte elements  as well as previously described nematode rte , aedes jam <dig>  <cit> , schistosoma sr <dig>  <cit> , oryzias rte  <cit> , partial rtes from bombyx  <cit> , and plant rte . this indicates the bmrte elements are highly divergent, being distributed among the caenorhabditis rte, bov-b line and animal rte subgroups . from the phylogenetic analysis, elements within the rte clade are grouped into four subgroups of plant/animal rte, rex3/rte, caenorhabditis rte/bombyx rte, and bov-b line/bombyx rte . hmrte-e <dig> and bmrte-d <dig> are clustered within the animal rtes, while bmrte-d <dig> and schistosoma sr <dig>  and bmrte-d <dig> and aedes jam <dig> are placed basal to the rex3/rte and plant/animal rte subgroups. the pattern of wide rte diversity within lepidoptera, and low similarity to other groups, suggests that the main lineages of bombyx rte elements identified here are ancient and not due to recent horizontal transfer of elements from non-arthropod groups.

in contrast, the high similarity among bov-b lines of reptiles and mammals  could be explained by horizontal transfer, as previously suggested by zupunski et al.  <cit> . these authors also inferred another instance of horizontal transfer from arthropods to reptiles based on similarity between bov-b from v. ammodytes and other reptiles, and partial sequences from b. mori they named bombyx bov-b/rte . we found the reptile/mammal group to cluster additionally with b. mori bmrte-d <dig>  -d <dig>  -d <dig>  and -d <dig>  but outside the other bombyx elements, pointing to this subgroup as the likely source of the horizontal transfer. as also pointed out by zupunski et al.  <cit> , horizontal transfer between plant and fish rte elements was also evident , and the distribution of plant-like elements within fishes is wider than previously suspected, as shown by the element we have identified from the hagfish eptatretus.

lepidopteran rte elements in public dna databases
a few examples of partial rte elements in non-coding flanking sequences or introns of genes from lepidoptera have been deposited in public databases. chen and li  <cit>  looked for tes neighbouring cytochrome p <dig> genes in helicoverpa zea, and recognized a partial rte element they named hzrte- <dig> within the third intron of cyp9a12v <dig> . this partial element was  <dig>  bp long, flanked by  <dig> bp tsds, encoded an rt domain with 40% amino acid sequence identity to the c. elegans rte- <dig> , and was terminated by a region of tga trinucleotide repeats in the short 3' utr. xu et al.  <cit>  discovered genes with similarity to delta- <dig> desaturases  implicated in pheromone biosynthesis in ostrinia nubilalis and o. furnacalis; each of which was adjacent to a partial rte element with 78% amino acid identity to the c-terminal  <dig> residues of bmrte-d <dig> . these authors recognized the sequence similarity to the c. elegans rte- <dig> element, but considered the partial elements from ostrinia to represent a new family which they named ezi, although this ostrinia family was clearly clustered within the rte- <dig> clade in their phylogenetic analysis  <cit> . no ssrs were found in the 3' utr of these elements.

other instances of lepidopteran sequences in genbank that we found have not been previously recognized as rte elements. these include two partial hzrte-1-like sequences  within the first intron of two different alleles of a cadherin gene from h. armigera  . a  <dig> bp partial hzrte-1-like sequence was also found in the second intron of the preproattacin a gene  of the noctuid moth trichoplusia ni. in b. mori, rte elements are common features of genes deposited in genbank. for example, in the gdna sequence for cuticle protein genes bmwcp <dig> - bmwcp <dig> , two partial elements  were identified, with both partial elements flanked by tsds and n ssr units at the 3' utr . other lepidopteran species with significant gdna homology to rte elements  included the prophenoloxidase-activating proteinase- <dig> gene from manduca sexta , the hemolymph storage protein  <dig> gene from samia cynthia , the farnesyl diphosphate synthase gene from choristoneura fumiferana , the arylphorin gene of galleria mellonella , a bac clone from heliconius numata  and a larval serum protein gene from b. mandarina  .

rte elements in lepidopteran microsatellite clones
the largest collection of microsatellite markers for any single lepidopteran species was assembled by miao et al.  <cit>  in b. mori. more than  <dig>  positive clones were identified by hybridization, yielding  <dig>  confirmed by sequencing and  <dig> polymorphic markers that were used to construct a linkage map. of these,  <dig> were deposited in genbank, and we identified  <dig> containing fragments of one or more of the bmrte elements by blast. thus about 12% of this collection of microsatellite markers contained one or more rte elements.

in their survey of repeated flanking sequences in lepidopteran microsatellite markers, van't hof et al.  <cit>  defined four different lepidopteran specific core sequences  that were represented in a large number of clones. translation of the reverse complement of their  <dig> bp lcsc <dig> in the second reading frame produces a protein sequence identical to the last  <dig> residues of bmrte-d <dig>  moreover, the nucleotide sequence is identical to the corresponding region of hzrte- <dig>  thus the class of unilateral repeated microsatellites similar to lcsc <dig> has an rte element flanking one side. examples  include h. armigera microsatellite clones had <dig>   <cit> , harssr <dig>   <cit>  and harssr <dig>   <cit> , the h. zea hzms1- <dig> microsatellite marker   <cit> , and the b. anynana microsatellite marker ba-atg <dig>   <cit> . tsd sequences were identified for hzms1- <dig>  had <dig>  harssr <dig>  and ba-atg <dig> 

the 3' ends of rte elements are widespread in microsatellites isolated from many lepidopteran species. figure  <dig> shows representative samples from  <dig> different species, translated and aligned with the most similar 3' end of a b. mori rte element. the high similarity at the protein level and the ssrs immediately following the stop codon are evident. different rte elements can account for the subgroups 2a and 2b of microsatellites of bicyclus anynana previously described by van't hof et al.  <cit>  .

additionally,  <dig> related non-redundant lepidopteran microsatellite dna loci were identified by tblastn searches based on protein sequences of the full-length hmrte-e <dig> element,  <dig> full-length elements bmrte-d <dig> to -d <dig>  one partial harte-t <dig> and six partial barte elements . a further  <dig> microsatellite loci with significant threshold values were identified from blastn searches of lscs <dig>  hzrte-1- <dig> and mcrte-t <dig> partial rte elements. lepidopteran rte protein and dna sequence homology searches therefore identified association between microsatellite dna loci and the non-ltr rte elements from a total of  <dig> species from superfamilies papilionidea , hesperiidae , geometroidea , noctuoidea , bombycoidea , pyraloidea , tortricoidae  and yponomeutoidea . a wide diversity of ssr units for the reported microsatellite loci was identified n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n; additional file 5). the numbers of ssr units varied greatly from two to >  <dig>  and included perfect, compound and imperfect ssr units.

in various reported microsatellite dna loci , ; a. caja, ; l. botrana, ; b. betularia, ; and c. pomonella, ), rte-like sequences were present but they did not correspond to the 3' end of the element and were not immediately adjacent to the ssr units. these likely correspond to ancient rte insertions that have been interrupted by later insertions of other elements . multiple insertion events in close proximity by different rte elements were also detected. in b. anynana ba-atg <dig> , opposite orientations of barte-d <dig> and barte-d <dig> elements were identified and included the repeat motifs  <dig> and  <dig> respectively . in the partial b. anynana gdna clone ba-atg <dig> , double insertions by barte elements were detected at both 5' and 3' termini. the 5' terminal partial barte-d <dig> element was located at nucleotide positions  <dig> to  <dig> and included the ta <dig> ssr units. at the 3' terminus of  we identified the barte-d <dig> element at nucleotide positions  <dig> to  <dig>  however no ssr units was found .

nucleotide positions within the microsatellite loci dna sequences where respective rtes were located, and the approximate lengths of the partial rtes are also provided. amino acid sequence identity  and e-values were ascertained by stand-alone blastx searches against bmrtes and partial rtes amino acid sequences . multiple insertions of rtes in close proximity within individual microsatellite dna loci  are also shown.

note: iub genetic code 'k' used for .

overall, of  <dig>  lepidopteran microsatellite sequences deposited in genbank,  <dig> or almost 10% were found to contain an rte element . the top  <dig> lepidopteran species accounted for  <dig>  microsatellites,  <dig> or almost 12% of which contain rte elements. there is some heterogeneity within this group, with rte content ranging from 0% to 44%. the remaining species with  <dig> or fewer microsatellites each account for  <dig> loci, only  <dig> of which  contain rtes. these differences could reflect actual species differences in microsatellite frequencies or methodological differences among different researchers; only some of which used enrichment techniques.

molecular characterization of had <dig> non-allelic size variants in h. armigera
the microsatellite marker had <dig> was developed by scott et al.  <cit>  and used by them in population studies of h. armigera in australia. sequence comparisons of a flanking region showed high similarity to lscs <dig> and microsatellite loci from other lepidoptera harbouring the 3' end of an rte element , and so to examine the reproducibility and reliability of this marker, we cloned and sequenced size variants from two h. armigera individuals collected from dalmore, victoria. among five clones from individual ad <dig>  three sequence variants of different sizes were identified ;  <dig> bp, ;  <dig> bp, ). the  <dig> bp band  possessed an ssr motif of  <dig>  the  <dig> bp band  had  <dig>  and the  <dig> bp band  had  <dig>  in the ad <dig> individual, a  <dig> bp variant , with  <dig> ) and a  <dig> bp variant ), with 4) were identified. the  <dig> bp band from ad <dig> and the  <dig> bp band from ad <dig> were very similar to the published sequence of had <dig> and are probably allelic. the other bands, however, show no similarity to these two or to one another in the region to the right of the ssr, except for the  <dig> bp corresponding to the forward primer . thus these bands are not likely to be alleles of had <dig> but instead represent amplicons generated by the reverse primer's annealing to independent, unlinked sites of insertion of the 3' end of the rte element, and the forward primer's annealing to nearby regions with enough sequence similarity to generate a pcr product.

discussion
we have identified several rte non-ltr retrotransposable elements in the lepidoptera, and provided evidence for their association with unilateral microsatellite dna families. these lepidopteran rte elements therefore join a small group of tes in other organisms  as being associated with the genesis of microsatellite dna repeat units. they account for a significant fraction of microsatellite markers isolated by many independent groups working with lepidoptera , and their wide occurrence may be partly responsible for problematical aspects of these markers.

non-ltr rte elements have a wide but disjunct phylogenetic distribution in eukaryotes  <cit>  and have been found in sea urchins , nematodes , blood flukes , mosquitoes , amphioxus , fishes , snakes  and mammals  as well as plants  <cit> . we have identified additional full-length elements from cnidaria, mollusca, and hagfish, as well as  <dig> from the genome of b. mori and one from h. melpomene. lepidopteran rte elements discovered so far are very diverse but are all grouped into the rte clade of malik et al.  <cit> .

genomic insertion sites of rtes do not appear to be sequence-specific, and can be discerned only by target-site duplications of  <dig> -  <dig> bp after insertion. the typically short 3' utr often contains di- or tri-nucleotide simple sequence repeats. truncated rte elements consisting only of the 3' end of the rt coding sequence followed by the 3' utr and flanked by target-site duplications are often found in genomes. this configuration suggests that a staggered double-stranded break in the target sequence was made, followed by reverse transcription of the full-length rna element from the 3' end, which was interrupted before completion so that only the 3' end of the element was finally inserted between the target-site duplications. a large number of truncated elements may accumulate due to the replication efforts of just a few full-length elements, similar to that reported for l <dig> retrotransposons . for example, in the mosquito anopheles gambiae, the ag-jammin- <dig> element is represented by five copies with intact orfs and about  <dig>  truncated elements  <cit> . in the absence of a full-length rte sequence as evidence, such truncated rte elements may be misidentified as short interspersed nucleotide elements  which by contrast are usually derived from abundant cellular rnas, lack coding potential, possess poly tails, are independently transcribed from their own internal pol iii promoters, and utilize proteins encoded by other retro-elements for their insertion. similarity of the predicted protein sequences at the 3' ends enabled malik and eickbush  <cit>  to recognize that some families previously classified as sines were actually truncated rte elements, just as it has enabled us to recognize rte elements within isolated microsatellite markers. this is because it is easier to recognize homology of divergent protein sequences than nucleotide sequences.

some insect tes show a preference for inserting into specific sequences, and sometimes these sequences are simple sequence repeats. for example, dong targets the n of the ribosomal dna non-transcribed spacer region  <cit> , and the telomere-specific tras families target pentameric n ssr units  <cit> . since these ssr-target insertion sequences are pre-existing, te insertion would not increase the abundance of ssrs in the genome, but could increase the abundance of a particular unilateral family of ssr repeats by juxtaposing more copies of the te next to ssrs existing in different genomic locations. we were not able to find evidence of dong or tras elements in microsatellite markers isolated from lepidoptera; however it may be that some of the still-uncharacterized lscs sequence families are formed in this way. by contrast, each new insertion of an rte element with ssrs in the 3' utr does increase the abundance of ssrs in the genome. the ssr may have been present in the 3' utr in the rna molecule participating in the insertion, or may have been incorporated into the cdna by slippage of the rt enzyme during reverse transcription. but since the ssr is positioned between the two tsds, it clearly did not exist in that location prior to the insertion event.

some fingerprinting methods benefit from the random multiple insertion of transposable elements into genomes  <cit> , however, these do not yield single-copy markers. the difficulty of developing lepidopteran microsatellites that function as reliable single-copy codominant markers is widely acknowledged . our sequence comparison of size variants of the microsatellite marker had <dig> showed that at least three different loci were being amplified in different individuals, violating the single-copy assumption. with respect to codominance, a deficiency in observed levels of heterozygosity relative to hardy-weinberg expectations has been reported for many published lepidopteran microsatellite dna markers, and has often been attributed to the presence of null alleles . null alleles can significantly alter the estimation of population substructure patterns by decreasing the within population allelic diversity . however, many microsatellite loci reported to exhibit significantly lower than expected levels of heterozygosity are associated with rte elements, such as in h. armigera , h. zea , y. padellus , a. epimuta  and b. betularia . although it is still unknown whether a systematic rte-associated effect on heterozygosity exists, the possibility deserves to be taken into consideration along with other explanations such as the wahlund effect or selection pressure .

one approach to improving the reliability of microsatellite markers is to target single-copy regions in the genome. widdel et al.  <cit>  used cot analysis to isolate the slowly-reannealing, low-copy-number fraction of the genome of ae. japonicus from which ssr clones were subsequently isolated. another approach is to sort through clones already obtained to identify those sharing similarities in their flanking regions and discarding these; meglécz  <cit>  has described a computer program microfamily for that purpose. another alternative for developing codominant markers is to avoid ssrs entirely and to design pcr primers to conserved exons in protein-coding genes to screen for polymorphisms in the intervening intron . a completely opposite strategy is to exploit the high copy number and dispersed distribution of the repeated sequences flanking microsatellites to develop fingerprinting-type, dominant markers  <cit> . anderson et al.  <cit>  developed two repetitive flanking sequences  based on microsatellites isolated from a. caja, where both refs markers are part of the lscs <dig> sequence with minor variations. they used pcr primers designed to these sequences to discriminate between different species of the moth genus schrankia and to detect interspecific hybrids; dominant markers are sufficient for both purposes. in this application, the sequence conservation of the rte element during evolution is useful for extending marker utility outside of the species of discovery, and insertions that occur after species divergence are useful for discriminating species; presuming that these insertions have fixed.

new lepidopteran tes are continuously being identified and characterized . tes identified to date in the lepidoptera are likely to represent only a fraction of the total numbers and types, and some of these others may also be responsible for the genesis of unilateral or bilateral microsatellite dna families in various lepidopteran species.

CONCLUSIONS
the presence of microsatellite dna families in the lepidoptera has mystified many evolutionary and population geneticists over the last decade. our findings that non-ltr retrotransposable elements of the rte clade have rendered large proportions of lepidopteran microsatellite dna markers developed to-date ineffective is indicative of the depth of problems challenging many researchers who have invested resources to developing such molecular genetics tools. our study will enable te-affected dna markers to be recognised across a wide range of organisms, thus allowing informed decisions to be made regarding the utilisation of such dna markers in future population and evolutionary genetic studies. the presence of rtes across diverse plant and animal evolutionary lineages implies that the rte-associated microsatellite dna families phenomenon may be widespread in many biological systems, and likely to represent one of the many yet unrecognised classes of tes capable of generating microsatellite dna families.
