BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of serious community-acquired diseases , especially in children, the elderly, and among patients with immunological disorders  <cit> . nasopharyngeal colonization by s. pneumoniae is highly common, particularly among children attending day-care centers and in adults in long-term institutions  <cit> .

pneumococci are presently divided into  <dig> serotypes, which are defined by differences in their polysaccharide capsule  <cit> . two serotype-based vaccines are currently available: the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine  which has been shown to be effective in the elderly  <cit> , and the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine  which is used in children below the age of two  <cit> . in the usa the introduction of pcv <dig> in children was associated with a decrease in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal diseases  among children and adults  <cit> . moreover, a decrease in ipd caused by resistant strains has also been observed  <cit> . although current ipd rates are lower than those observed in the pre-vaccine period, recent reports have shown an increase in ipd caused by non-vaccine serotypes in the usa  <cit> . in spain, since the introduction of pcv <dig>  ipd rates due to pcv <dig> serotypes have decreased in both children and adults, but this improvement has been counterbalanced by an increase in ipd due to non-pcv <dig> serotypes  <cit> .

currently, two new conjugated vaccines are under development – 10-valent and the 13-valent vaccines, which both contain some emerging serotypes  <cit> . alternative vaccines are also being evaluated, such as those based on pneumococcal virulence proteins. many pneumococcal proteins have been investigated as vaccine candidates, for instance, pneumolysin, psaa, pspc, and pspa  <cit> . the pneumococcal surface protein a  is an important virulence factor which interferes with complement deposition on the pneumococcal surface  <cit>  and is detected in almost all pneumococci  <cit> . it is highly immunogenic and protective and has proved to be highly cross-reactive both in various animal models  <cit>  and in humans  <cit> . it is hypothesized that a pspa-based vaccine could protect against invasive disease and also eliminate the carrier state  <cit> . pspa is constituted by five domains: a signal peptide, a α-helical charged domain which includes a clade-defining region, a proline-rich region, a choline-binding domain and a c-terminal domain  <cit> . although the pspa encoding gene  is highly genetically variable, the classification by families is based on nucleotide and amino acid identity. each of the three pspa families is subdivided into different clades: family  <dig> is composed by two clades , family  <dig> comprises three clades , and pspa family  <dig> has only one divergent clade   <cit> .

the aim of this study was to analyze the distribution of the pspa clades among a pneumococcal collection representative of major clones found in two previous studies among healthy children carriers  <cit>  and patients with invasive disease  <cit> .

methods
bacterial strains
one hundred and twelve pneumococcal strains previously characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis  with smai restriction enzyme, as described elsewhere  <cit>  and serotyped by quellung reaction  <cit> , were selected as follows:

a) forty-nine pneumococci isolated from adults with ipd in barcelona  between  <dig> and  <dig> . these  <dig> strains were representative of the  <dig> major genotypes found among  <dig> pneumococci causing ipd in adult patients in barcelona  <cit> . the pneumococcal strains selected were isolated from blood , csf  and other sterile fluids ;

b) seventeen pneumococci isolated from patients with ipd in oviedo  in 2004– <dig>  selected as representative of the nine major pfge patterns among  <dig> consecutive invasive strains . the selected strains were isolated from blood , csf  and other sterile fluids ;

c) forty-six pneumococci were selected from nasopharyngeal carriers aged from  <dig> to  <dig> years old, in oviedo  in 2004– <dig>  <cit>  . these strains were representative of  <dig> dominant pfge patterns found among  <dig> pneumococci isolated from children attending  <dig> day-care centers.

antimicrobial susceptibility testing
the minimal inhibitory concentration  was determined by microdilution following clsi guidelines  <cit>  using a panel of antimicrobials which included penicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and cotrimoxazol. resistant strains were defined according to clsi criteria  <cit> . s. pneumoniae atcc  <dig> was used as control.

multilocus sequence typing  and eburst
mlst was performed as described previously  <cit> . the allele's number and sequence types  were assigned using the pneumococcal mlst website  <cit> . lineage assignment was achieved by eburst analysis  <cit> .

pspa detection
the pcrs were carried out in a standard pcr mixture of  <dig> μl containing  <dig>  mm of mgcl <dig>   <dig> μm  of deoxynucleoside triphosphates ,  <dig>  μm of each primer, and  <dig> u of taq dna polymerase . the cycle conditions consisted of: an initial 94°c ,  <dig> cycles of 94°c , 55°c  and 72°c , followed by 72°c . a multiplex pcr reaction was tested  <cit> , but some samples did not amplify with lsm12/skh <dig>  <cit>  or lsm12/skh <dig>  <cit>  primer combinations. the combination of lsm12/skh <dig> primers  <cit>  was successfully used for all samples except one. the isolate that did not amplify was retested with the same cycle pattern at an annealing temperature of 52°c and with different primer combinations . controls for pspa family  <dig>  and pspa family  <dig>  were run in each reaction set. pcr products were purified and sequenced using skh <dig> primer, as described elsewhere  <cit> . sequence edition was performed using the seqscape version  <dig> . <dig>  software, while dna sequences were assigned using blast  <cit> . clade type was established when the closest match presented identity higher than 95% . the phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using mega <dig> version  <dig>  software  <cit> . the evolutionary history was inferred using the neighbor-joining method and the bootstrap consensus tree inferred from  <dig> replicates. the evolutionary distances were computed using the kimura 2-parameter method  <cit> .

nucleotide sequence accession numbers
the sequences of  <dig> isolates representing all the different sequences from this collection were deposited in genbank with accession numbers: .

RESULTS
pspa families and clade distribution
among the  <dig> pneumococci studied, the majority  were identified as belonging to pspa family  <dig> , while the remaining  <dig> %  belonged to family  <dig> . one strain was negative. no pspa family  <dig> isolates were detected. figure  <dig> shows the phylogenetic tree of the  <dig> new pspa sequences found as well as the accession numbers and the percentage of identity to previously published sequences. sequences of strains of pspa families  <dig> and  <dig> were precisely grouped, and all were joined into their respective clades. the similarity of isolates of the same family ranged from 84% to 100%. the percentage of similarity within isolates of the same clade ranged as follows: clade  <dig> , clade  <dig> , clade  <dig> , clade  <dig>  and clade  <dig> .

among the  <dig> pneumococci isolated from patients with ipd,  <dig> %  were found to be of pspa family  <dig> ,  <dig> %  of family  <dig>  and one isolate was negative. the high prevalence of pspa family  <dig> among pneumococci isolated from adults with ipd has already been reported in spain, canada, sweden, the usa and france  <cit> , although in australia, the uk and japan pspa family  <dig> was the most prevalent  <cit> . the dominance of family  <dig>  clade  <dig> observed in our study has also been reported in other studies of pneumococci causing ipd in adults in france  <cit>  and in children from germany  <cit> .

pspa family  <dig> was also dominant  among pneumococci isolated from the nasopharynx of healthy children , while family  <dig> accounted for  <dig> %  of the strains . these data are in agreement with two pspa studies  <cit>  which found pspa family  <dig> to be dominant among pneumococci isolated from brazilian children carriers. moreover, the clade distribution also showed a prevalence of clade  <dig>  followed by clade  <dig> and clade  <dig>  <cit> . a recent publication with data collected from pneumococci isolated from nasopharyngeal carriage in finnish children showed similar prevalences of pspa family  <dig> and family  <dig>  <cit> .

additional file  <dig> shows the results for pspa family and clade of the  <dig> pneumococcal isolates studied with respect to sequence type , serotype, resistance pattern and source. the pneumococci isolated from children carriers or from patients with ipd invasive disease seem to be indistinct, suggesting that pspa type is independent of age or clinical origin, as has been shown elsewhere  <cit> .

relationship between pspa and serotypes
in agreement with previous studies  <cit>  our results showed that pspa clades are independent of serotypes. pneumococci of the same serotype were associated with different pspa clades from the same or a different family . for instance, pneumococci of serotype 6a could have pspa clade  <dig> , whereas pneumococci of serotype 6b could express pspa clades  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> . since pspa is independent of serotype, pspa-based vaccines could improve upon the results obtained with serotype-based vaccines and might avoid a possible serotype replacement, as previously observed  <cit> . since a pspa-based vaccine potentially has high coverage due to the fact that it is cross protective and immunogenic among children and adults  <cit> , similar data should be investigated in other geographical areas in order to study the potential coverage of a pspa-based vaccine, and to adapt it to different formulations if necessary.

relationship between pspa and clones
pspa clade classification was related to genotypes, and all strains with the same st always presented the same pspa clade , regardless of origin or capsular type. in spite of the high genetical variability of pspa gene, all isolates of the same st showed 100% of identity between their sequences. for instance, among nine pneumococci with st <dig> obtained from invasive and carriage samples, four capsular types were found  but all of them had pspa of clade  <dig> . however, other authors have found different pspa families among isolates that shared a common st  <cit> . in our study, among  <dig> sts found, only  <dig> accounted for more than three isolates . this fact may be a limitation of the present study and may affect its capacity to assess the relationship between st and pspa.

the eburst analysis reveals the presence of  <dig> clonal complexes  and  <dig> singletons  . the association of cc and s with clade was as follows: clade  <dig> , clade  <dig> , clade  <dig> , clade  <dig> , and clade  <dig> . four ccs contained only clade 1-associated sts, three ccs contained clade 4-related sts, two ccs contained only clade 2-related sts, and two cc contained clade 3-related sts. four ccs contained sts related to two different clades of the same or a different pspa family.

the relationship of pspa clade with multiresistant worldwide-disseminated clones described by the pneumococcal molecular epidemiology network   <cit>  has been reported previously  <cit> . our study provides further information since the majority of ccs found are related to pmen clones. for instance, the spain9v-st <dig>  clone, which is one of the most important clones causing ipd worldwide  <cit> , included six sts in the present study. all six sts of this cc had pspa clade  <dig>  suggesting that pspa is highly conserved in this clone, even in slv or dlv or when expressing capsular type  <dig> v or  <dig>  similar results were found among other ccs related to other multiresistant pmen clones: spain6b-st <dig> , spain14-st <dig> , denmark14-st <dig> , spain23f-st <dig> , greece21-st <dig>  and sweden15a-st <dig> . the cc <dig> related to pmen clone tennessee23f-st <dig>  which included six sts in our study, had two pspa clades . this finding was in agreement with a study from finland, which found pspa from families  <dig> and  <dig> among isolates within the same or different st of this cc <dig>  <cit> .

there is still little information about the relationship between pspa clade and antibiotic-susceptible pmen clones, since the available data only refer to family level  <cit> . our study provides new information about the antibiotic-susceptible clones, which are associated with the increase of ipd observed in recent years in some european countries  <cit>  and in the usa  <cit> . for instance, the sweden1-st <dig> clone had clade  <dig>  this clone has been described as the cause of ipd outbreaks in europe and its frequency is currently increasing in spain as cause of ipd and, especially, parapneumonic empyema in children  <cit> . ccs which were also related to antibiotic-susceptible pmen clones included clade  <dig>  and clade  <dig> . other associations of pspa clade with emerging clones were also observed such as clade  <dig> for serotype 22-st <dig> and serotype 10a-cc <dig>  and clade  <dig> for serotype 12-st <dig>  the cc <dig>  included strains of two clades: clade  <dig> for those isolated with st <dig> that were serotype  <dig>  and clade  <dig> for isolates with st <dig>  that were serotype 11a or non-typeable.

since pspa type is associated with genotype, and with our knowledge of the clonal distribution of pneumococci causing ipd in southern barcelona area  <cit>  we estimate that at least  <dig> % would be of pspa family  <dig>  and  <dig> % of family  <dig>  the most prevalent clades among invasive pneumococci would be clade  <dig>  and clade  <dig> . similarly, we estimate that among the pneumococci isolated from children carriage  <cit>  at least  <dig> % appear to be pspa family  <dig> and  <dig> % pspa family  <dig>  with clade  <dig>  and clade  <dig>  being the most frequent.

CONCLUSIONS
our study supports previous data  <cit>  demonstrating that pspa family and clade distribution are independent of serotype, age and clinical origin of the isolates, but are highly associated with genotype. this study suggests that pspa family  <dig> and  <dig> molecules should be included in future pspa-based vaccine formulations. further studies are needed to determine the genetic diversity of pspa in each geographical area.
