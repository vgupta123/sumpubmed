BACKGROUND
more than 20% of all mammalian species are bats, making them an extraordinarily important and successful group from an evolutionary perspective  <cit> . bats are unique amongst mammals for their ability to fly, and possess notable traits such as long life expectancy in proportion to body size  <cit> . many species of bats exhibit exotic traits including echolocation and hibernation, and bats are an important part of the ecosystem via plant pollination and insect control  <cit> . notoriously, bats are also reservoir hosts for a large number of zoonotic viruses  <cit> . understanding the mechanisms by which bats co-exist with and seemingly tolerate viruses that are deadly in humans and other mammals has implications for human health, and may facilitate development of new antiviral strategies.

one aspect of the bat-virus relationship that has not been investigated in detail is the role of host gene regulation, in particular the role of micrornas . mirnas are essential regulators of eukaryotic gene expression  <cit>  and include elements required for viral replication  <cit> . mirna biogenesis is a multistep process in which primary-mirna transcripts  are cleaved into precursor-mirna  by the nuclear rnase iii drosha and then further processed in the cytoplasm by dicer <dig> to produce mature mirnas averaging 22 nt in length  <cit> . this process produces transcripts from both arms of the precursor, whereas the loop and flanking sequences are destroyed. this information is exploited by mirna-finding algorithms such as mirdeep <dig> for the identification of mirna-like sequences in small rna transcriptome data.

mature mirnas have been found in over  <dig> species of plants, animals and viruses  <cit> . while no p. alecto mirnas have yet been reported, recent studies identified mirnas in the little brown bat myotis lucifugus
, the big brown bat, eptesicus fuscus
 <cit> , and the jamaican flying fox, artebius jamaicensis
 <cit> . additionally, bat genomes within the ensembl database  feature mirna annotations based on homology to the human genome.

in this study, the small rna transcriptome of the black flying fox  was sequenced from a pooled tissue sample. mirdeep <dig> was used to identify conserved and novel mirnas, and a variety of methods were employed to assess those predictions. target prediction and annotation enrichment analysis were undertaken to identify mirnas with putative roles in pathways that are relevant to virus-host interaction. these results will enable fundamental insights into mirna-mediated gene regulation in bats, and are an important step towards determining the molecular basis of bats’ role as virus reservoirs.

RESULTS
identification of p. alectomirnas
illumina deep-sequencing of small rna from pooled p. alecto tissues yielded a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads, each  <dig> nucleotides in length, which have been submitted to the sequence read archive  under bioproject accession number prjna <dig>  figure  <dig> illustrates the analysis pipeline used to identify mirnas. approximately 30% of the raw reads were discarded during data filtering, mainly due to absence of the 3’ adapter . data quality was examined before and after trimming and filtering . mirnas were then identified using mirdeep <dig>  as no p. alecto mirnas were known prior to this undertaking, mirdeep <dig> was provided with a large set of learning information in the form of all known vertebrate mirnas from a recent release of mirbase . this resulted in identification of  <dig> distinct mirna precursors, from which  <dig> different mature and star transcripts were detected . while  <dig>  of the precursors mapped to a unique locus, the remaining  <dig> consisted of  <dig> overlapping pairs plus an overlapping triplet. for  <dig> of these pairs, the presence of star reads for one member only and/or large differences in mirdeep <dig> scores indicated the likely precursor . the lower scoring precursor in each of these cases was excluded from further analysis. six overlapping pairs remained unresolved, either due to an absence of star reads or because mature and star sequences were palindromic, thus the set of p. alecto mirnas in this dataset consists of  <dig> candidates.figure  <dig>

mirdeep <dig> flagged four putative mirnas as possible trna/rrna. to incorporate the latest knowledge of non-coding  rna, we compared predicted p. alecto mirna precursors with all known ncrna in a recent version of rfam  . a total of  <dig> p. alecto mirnas were supported by rfam hits to known mirnas. a further nineteen exhibited similarity to other types of ncrna. hits to ncrnas other than mirnas do not necessarily preclude candidates from being true mirnas, however they may be less reliable than other candidates.

homology to mirnas in other species
bat mirnas were compared to the following collections of reference mirna sequence data: mirbase version  <dig> ; biggar et al.  <cit> ; platt et al.  <cit> ; ensembl . of the  <dig> p. alecto mirnas examined, a total of  <dig> mature sequences and  <dig> star sequences were 100% identical to mature vertebrate entries in mirbase. p. alecto mirnas were then compared to the reference data using blastn . to allow for minor length variations, all mature and star blast searches were filtered such that the ends of each alignment were allowed to overhang but were not allowed to mismatch. this revealed an additional  <dig> p. alecto mature mirnas that had hits to mirbase  <dig> vertebrates with 100% internal identity but one or more over- hanging or under-hanging ends. a further  <dig> mature p. alecto mirnas had high-scoring hits to mirbase  <dig> vertebrates but contained internal mismatches or gaps, while  <dig> p. alecto mature mirnas had no reliable hits against mirbase  <dig> vertebrates at all. this process was repeated using mature, star and precursor sequences against each of the reference datasets, producing hits for a further  <dig> p. alecto mirnas. of the remaining  <dig> p. alecto mirnas that had no blast hits at all,  <dig> had mirdeep <dig> scores ≥  <dig> and three had mirdeep <dig> scores ≥  <dig> figure  <dig> 
homology of bat mirnas to vertebrate mature mirnas in mirbase.
p. alecto mature and star mirnas were compared to a database of all vertebrate mirnas extracted from mirbase  using blastn. 100% identity indicates that no internal gaps or mismatches were present in alignments between p. alecto mirnas and their respective top blast hits. minor length variations were allowed in this category, but the alignments were end-anchored to prevent mismatches at the termini. mirnas in the mismatch category had internal mismatches or indels relative to their top blast hits, whereas mirnas in the no-hit category had no convincing blast hits. search parameters are described in detail in the materials and methods.



notably, two p. alecto precursors  had large numbers of hits to p. vampyrus precursors , in each case representing a variety of similar but different sequences rather than one single repeated sequence. in contrast, a single p. alecto precursor  had a similarly high number of hits in m. lucifugus, however this appeared to be due to low-complexity composition of the precursor  as opposed to genuine homology.

mirnas in introns and clusters
many mirnas are located within the introns of protein-coding genes  <cit> . we identified  <dig> mirnas physically located within introns of annotated bat genes, while three  were fully overlapping with coding exons . of these, pal-can- <dig>  is located within an exon of dgcr <dig>  a protein involved in mirna biogenesis in humans  <cit> . five mirnas overlapped with exon boundaries and could potentially be regulated by splicing events  <cit> .

many mirnas are arranged in local clusters on chromosomes  <cit> . the p. alecto genome currently consists of contigs and scaffolds that are not yet mapped to individual chromosomes, however with an n <dig> size of  <dig>  mb  <cit> , many scaffolds are easily large enough to contain such clusters. mirna clusters were located by identifying mirnas spaced less than 5000 bp apart. mirna pairs located < 60 bp apart were shown to be overlapping as described above. such pairs were treated as a single entity and were only considered part of a cluster if they grouped with at least one other non-overlapping mirna. a total of  <dig> clusters comprising  <dig> mirna genes were identified according to these criteria .

the largest identified bat mirna cluster contained  <dig> mirnas and is homologous to the recognised dlk1-dio <dig> cluster on human chromosome  <dig>  known to be involved in disease pathogenesis  <cit> . three novel bat mirnas were located within this cluster, including one  that returned blast hits to mir- <dig> but had three mismatches relative to other vertebrates, including two unique differences in the seed region. for the two other novel bat mirnas within this cluster , the mature sequences produced non-identical blast hits to mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  respectively, however the star sequences were 100% identical to mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> star sequences, respectively.

a total of  <dig> novel p. alecto mirnas were located within  <dig> clusters, and five clusters contained only novel mirnas. two such clusters each contained three novel mirnas that all scored highly by mirdeep <dig>  the first of these consisted of pal-can- <dig>  pal-can- <dig> and pal-can- <dig>  the closest nearby genes, fmr <dig> and aff <dig>  are located a distance of  <dig> - <dig>  mb from the mirna cluster. in the human genome, fmr <dig> and aff <dig> are located on the x chromosome, adjacent to two recognised mirna clusters . one of the three bat mirnas in this cluster  returned a non-identical blast hit to dog mir- <dig>  while the other two returned only low-quality hits. the second cluster consisted of pal-can- <dig>  pal-can- <dig> and pal-can- <dig>  one of these  returned a blast hit to mir- <dig>  while the other two returned only low-quality blast hits . thus the two novel-only clusters appear to represent parts of the same cluster split over multiple scaffolds. based on homology, nine additional mirnas were identified that may also belong to this cluster. a proposed arrangement is shown in figure  <dig>  overall,  <dig> bat mirnas may represent members of a cluster homologous to the human x-chromosomal mir-506: <dig> cluster. only one of these  shares 100% mature sequence identity with a known vertebrate mirna , while the remaining  <dig> are unique to p. alecto. alignment of the individual sequences indicated that while blast was unable to identify homologues for more than half of these mirnas, a degree of similarity amongst them was clearly evident .figure  <dig>

seed sequence analysis
the nucleotide sequence corresponding to bases 2– <dig> of a mature mirna  is the most important region for determining target specificity  <cit> . the seed sequences of p. alecto mirnas were assessed . the  <dig> bat mirnas had  <dig> different seed sequences with  <dig> seed sequences appearing more than once. the most frequently occurring seeds were gaggua , which appeared  <dig> times and cuggac , which appeared  <dig> times. compared to mirbase vertebrate mature mirnas,  <dig> bat mirnas  appeared to have novel seed sequences. a potential weakness of this approach, however, is that if a mirna has an incorrectly predicted start site, then the predicted seed sequence will also be incorrect. therefore, only mirnas that aligned from position # <dig> in both the bat mature sequence and its top blast hit were considered reliable enough to determine true seed sequence. of the  <dig> mirnas with non-identical top blast hits,  <dig> aligned from position # <dig>  however only one of these  had a seed sequence that was unique amongst mirbase vertebrates.

given the high probability that at least one unrelated mirbase vertebrate mirna will match any given seed sequence by chance , further steps were taken to identify bat mirnas with novel seed sequences. mirnas that had non-identical top blast hits and also aligned from position # <dig> in both query and target were individually examined. of these, five were identified as having one or more unique differences in the seed sequence relative to their top blast hit. to confirm these observations, mature and star mirnas were compared against all of their blast hits , to evaluate whether the observed seed changes were truly unique in these bat mirnas relative to their counterparts in other vertebrates. the sequences, predicted secondary structures, and top-hit alignments of the five novel-seed mirnas are illustrated in figure  <dig> figure  <dig>

three of the five novel-seed mirnas  had both mature and star sequences that were unique to p. alecto in the sense that they were not shared by any of the blast hits to these sequences. two of these  had seed sequences  that were shared by single vertebrate entries in mirbase , yet they did not resemble those mirnas in any other respect. in contrast, pal-can- <dig> seed sequence  was completely unique amongst vertebrates, in the sense that it was not shared by any vertebrate mirna, including unrelated sequences. these three mirnas had mature/star read counts of 162/ <dig>  36/ <dig> and 10/ <dig>  respectively.

the two remaining p. alecto mirnas  had mature seed sequences distinct from those of their blast hits, however their star sequences matched with 100% identity to mirbase entries. of these, pal-can- <dig> had mature/star read counts of 31/1; however only a single mature read was detected for pal-can- <dig> 

ranking of novel candidate mirnas
in addition to the bat mirnas with confirmed novel seed sequences, a shortlist of the most promising novel mirna candidates was constructed by narrowing the master list by excluding conserved mirnas and those with low support. the following were excluded:  putative mirnas with 100%-identity blast hit  to a mirbase vertebrate entry,  putative mirnas with a mirdeep <dig> score below  <dig> ,  putative mirnas with a read count below  <dig>   putative mirnas that overlapped with another mirna and either scored substantially less than the overlapping partner or could not be differentiated from it based on score,  putative mirnas with a non-mirna hit in rfam. this left  <dig> mirnas, considered the most promising novel candidates for further study .table  <dig>

target prediction
it has been recognised that 3’ utrs are the preferred location for mirna binding sites in mrna targets  <cit> . target prediction was performed for the  <dig> mature p. alecto mirnas using the target scanning algorithm miranda and a database of 3’ utrs derived from p. alecto transcriptome data. to avoid potential artefacts, excessively long 3’ utrs  were excluded, resulting in a search space representing  <dig> different p. alecto genes corresponding to  <dig> different human genes . the median number of predicted gene targets per mirna was  <dig>  while the median number of predicted mirna hits per target gene was  <dig>  which in some cases included multiple hits from an individual mirna.

the highest-scoring mir:target prediction was pal-can-170:usp <dig>  which had  <dig> binding sites and a cumulative minimum free energy  of − <dig> . other high scoring mir:target predictions were pal-can-421:dnmbp ; and pal-can-207/pal-can-098:znf <dig> , and pal-can-290:rapgef <dig> . the highest-scoring mir:target predictions for individual sites were pal-can-194:alg <dig> with a minimum free energy  of − <dig> ; and pal-can-300:fanci .

amongst the most important mirna targets are transcription factors, since these can extend a mirna’s regulatory influence to multiple secondary targets. of the ~ <dig> transcription factors currently recognised within the human genome  <cit> ,  <dig> were present within the p. alecto 3’ utr database, including factors of immune-relevance such as interferon regulatory factors  and nf-κb . mir: target predictions involving transcription factors are listed in additional file 10: table s <dig>  predicted targets of the novel bat mirna pal-can- <dig> included the transcription factor zfat, involved in apoptosis and cell survival, as well as a number of genes with significant roles in apoptosis and host defence .table  <dig>

categorical enrichment analysis based on gene ontology  and kegg pathway annotations were performed using the lists of predicted target genes for each mirna . ranked by bonferroni-corrected p-values, the most significantly enriched go terms were go:0006357: “regulation of transcription from rna polymerase ii promoter”  and go:0000278: “mitotic cell cycle” ; go:0006325: “chromatin organization” . the most significantly enriched kegg pathways were hsa04912: gnrh signalling pathway ; hsa04060: cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction ; hsa04012: erbb signalling pathway ; and hsa03030: dna replication .

discussion
bats have long held special significance in the contexts of ecology and mammalian evolution, but have only recently been recognised as a major source of emerging infectious diseases  <cit> . to date, p. alecto mirnas have not been studied yet are likely to play significant roles in important cellular functions including immunity, apoptosis, the cell cycle, inflammation, and dna repair. in this study,  <dig> putative mirnas were identified in the small rna transcriptome of the black flying fox, p. alecto, of which  <dig> had mature sequences with 100% identity to known vertebrate mirnas in mirbase and  <dig> had homologs in mirbase but contained unique differences. the remaining  <dig> had no clear homology to known mirnas, yet many were predicted with high confidence and appear to be genuine novel bat mirnas.

the number of mirnas identified in p. alecto falls broadly within the range observed for other mammals. for the  <dig> vertebrate species used for comparative analysis in this study, the number of mirbase records ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  different studies have used different tissues, different quantities of data, different methods and different parameters for identifying mirnas, making direct comparisons difficult. in two somewhat comparable studies, mirdeep <dig> was used to identify  <dig> mirnas in the pig intestine, including  <dig> with a mirdeep <dig> score above − <dig>  <cit> , while in silico analysis of the horse genome identified a total of  <dig> mirnas  <cit> . studies in other species of bats have reported varying numbers of precursors, the highest being  <dig>  identified using miranalyzer on ~ <dig> million reads, with further confirmation provided by >  <dig> million additional reads  <cit> . another recent paper detected  <dig> mature and star mirnas corresponding to  <dig> precursors in the mouse transcriptome, however this was achieved using almost  <dig> million illumina reads  <cit> , more than 20x the data volume used in the present study. from these comparisons it can be concluded that the number of mirnas observed in the bat transcriptome can be considered fairly typical. for  <dig> of the  <dig> bat mirnas, reads corresponding to both mature and star sequences were detected, further increasing the likelihood that these mirnas result from specific mirna biogenesis.

there is, as yet, no universally accepted procedure for identifying novel mirnas in high-throughput sequencing data. in our study, the major factor determining the final number of mirnas was the mirdeep <dig> score. as may be expected, lowering the cut-off score involves a trade-off between sensitivity  and specificity . a cut-off score ≥  <dig> provides a typical starting point for mirna identification; however many highly-conserved mirnas which are very likely to be real do not meet this stringent cut-off. if the cut-off score is lowered, however, the number of highly improbable candidates rapidly increases. relying on a single, stringent cut-off point comes at a significant cost of missing many genuine mirnas. we concluded that within our data, mirdeep <dig> score and read depth were the factors that best enabled mirna identification. we chose a model that accepted all hits to known mirnas , novel hits with scores ≥  <dig> and read depth ≥  <dig> , and novel hits with scores ≥ − <dig> and read depth ≥  <dig> . following the initial screening, a further  <dig> candidates were culled because they overlapped higher-scoring candidates, leaving a total of  <dig> candidates under consideration. this model, in our opinion, reflected a better balance between sensitivity and specificity than a single parameter cut-off model. in support of our decision, we found that  <dig> out of the  <dig> mirnas that scored less than  <dig> returned good blast hits to known vertebrate mirnas in mirbase. the remaining  <dig> could not be specifically identified, but included  <dig> in clusters and  <dig> that had blast hits to mature mirnas in other bats. our further effort to prioritise novel mirna candidates based on the combined evidence provides additional guidance to assist with selecting candidates for further study.

one mirna  featured noticeably in the analysis. representing a homolog of mir- <dig>  this p. alecto mirna contained three unique changes in the mature sequence relative to other vertebrates, including two changes within the critical seed region. amongst its predicted gene targets was zfat, a zinc-finger protein with roles in cell survival and apoptosis   <cit> , and the tnf-receptor tnfrsf1b. in the rat, mir- <dig> is described as a brain-specific mirna involved in neuron proliferation and neurite outgrowth via suppression of synapsin i  <cit> , while the corresponding star sequence , has been reported to be downregulated in a region of the brain  in rats with experimentally-induced neuropathic pain  <cit> . it is well established that mirnas play important roles in apoptosis , and one possibility is that viruses such as hev block apoptosis via induction of host mirnas that downregulate pro-apoptotic genes. p. alecto mir- <dig> is a candidate mirna in such a scenario, however it remains to be experimentally determined as to whether the differences in the sequence of p. alecto mir- <dig> correspond to differences in function between bats and other mammals, or whether it plays any role in apoptosis.

four other mirnas, representing homologs of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-513c and mir- <dig> respectively, were also confirmed to have novel seed sequences in p. alecto. in humans, mir- <dig> is located within a cluster  that is overexpressed in melanoma  <cit> . in p. alecto, the novel mir- <dig> is also located within a putative cluster containing  <dig> other mirnas , the majority of which are novel. we note, however, that this cluster may be fast-evolving in mammals  <cit> . mirnas in true genomic clusters are not only close together, but are transcribed as a polycistronic transcript from a single promoter, therefore promoter analysis may also be required to confirm genuine polycistronic clusters  <cit> .

amongst the  <dig> most significant novel mirnas identified in p. alecto ,  <dig> were homologous to known vertebrate mirnas but contained unique differences, while the remaining  <dig> could not be aligned to existing mirnas and may represent unique or highly divergent bat mirnas. in addition to those already discussed, several mirnas within this set have significant functional roles in other mammals, some with potential significance to bat biology. we previously showed that in p. alecto, tp <dig>  and mdm <dig> contain mutations in subcellular localization signals required for nucleocytoplasmic shuttling  <cit> . mir- <dig>  which plays a role in the tp53:mdm <dig> interaction  <cit> , is unique in p. alecto and is presented in table  <dig> 

bats have a concentration of positively selected genes within the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, believed to reflect adaptations necessary for flight-related energy metabolism  <cit> . our recent analysis of bat genomes revealed positive selection within the dna damage response pathway and nf-κb pathway in bats, possibly reflecting compensatory adaptations to tolerate harmful byproducts produced by elevated metabolism  <cit> . target prediction found a putative connection between pal-can- <dig>  and fanci, which is involved in dna repair. other mirnas known to be involved in oxidative phosphorylation include mir-34a  <cit>  and mir- <dig>  <cit> , however both of these are conserved in p. alecto.

future directions involving mirnas in the black flying fox include analysis of differential mirna expression, correlating mirna expression with that of putative gene targets, and experimental validation of targets for individual mirna candidates. such studies will be greatly facilitated by the dataset, methods, and analysis pipeline provided in this study.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary,  <dig> putative mirnas have been identified in the black flying fox small rna transcriptome. this includes a number of novel mirnas that represent homologs of known mirnas with functions relevant to bat biology. these findings will facilitate further studies of gene regulation in bats in relation to their role as virus reservoirs and may shed light on mechanisms underlying bat-specific traits such as flight and longevity.
