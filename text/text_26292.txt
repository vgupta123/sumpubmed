BACKGROUND
morphometric quantification of variation in complex phenotypes is increasingly important to developmental studies of morphogenesis  <cit> . integrating morphometric methods into studies of experimentally modified embryonic development has proved valuable in determining the simultaneous effects of a given perturbation on morphogenesis across the developing head . similarly, these methods allow quantification of subtle changes in phenotype that is necessary when examining the simultaneous effects of multiple factors on development of a given trait, as is increasingly common in systems-biology informed approaches  <cit> .

landmark based morphometric methods have commonly been used to quantify the size and shape of individual craniofacial bones, a skeletal region, or the whole skull . while skeletal landmarks have been used to quantify craniofacial morphogenesis during the late embryonic period, there is also a need to quantify the effects of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions that control initial growth and fusion of facial prominences before ossification begins and which have a significant influence on subsequent craniofacial morphology  <cit> . given a lack of skeletal features and difficulties distinguishing soft tissue layers using computed tomography and other 3d imaging modalities during the earliest period of facial morphogenesis, the external ectodermal surface of the embryo provides the best features upon which to place landmarks for the measurement of craniofacial form  <cit> .

head surface landmarks based on either 2d photographs or 3d surfaces have previously served as a basis for quantifying the effect of developmental perturbations in embryonic chicks  <cit>  and mice  <cit> . with increasing demand for quantification of craniofacial morphogenesis during the earlier embryonic period  <cit> , the direct comparison of morphometric data between studies of different species, mouse strains, disease models, and ages becomes an enticing possibility. just as large collections of publically-available and well-annotated genomic data facilitate new directions in hypothesis-driven research, a phenomic collection of directly comparable morphometric data has the potential to advance our understanding of the bases for typical and dysmorphic craniofacial variation  <cit> .

standardization of landmark definitions and confidence that datasets produced by multiple observers are comparable is necessary before morphometric analyses of landmarks from across a large number of mouse populations can be completed. typical difficulties encountered when defining good landmarks  are exacerbated for ectodermal embryonic surfaces because the rapid growth of facial prominences and associated shape changes make it more difficult to define homologous landmarks . in addition, less reliable landmarks may be necessary to adequately quantify phenotypic traits across the head  <cit> . keeping these difficulties in mind, we defined and tested a standard set of landmarks on the exterior surface of embryonic mice that include only explicitly homologous landmarks to serve as the basis for ontogenetic analyses of facial prominence growth and development between embryonic days  <dig> , e <dig> , and e <dig> .

a biological definition of each landmark , practical definitions of landmark placement, illustrations defining standard orientation and anatomical directions, and examples of landmarks placed on the 3d surface of a reference specimen at each age were developed in an attempt to maximize consistency in landmark placement by and between observers additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  explicit biological definitions facilitate the interpretation of results from morphometric analyses by tying landmarks directly to biological features of interest. the practical definitions, which can vary by age, were written to guide the placement of each landmark so that it matches the biological definition. the illustrations and landmark placement examples were meant to take the guesswork out of interpreting written definitions. four observers, three of whom had experience taking landmarks and one of whom had never landmarked before, used these resources to collect landmark coordinates from a sample of e <dig> , e <dig> , and e <dig>  mouse embryos in order to measure the intra- and inter-observer error associated with this landmark set.

simplified biological definitions for all landmarks as well as landmark subset definitions. full biological and practical definitions are provided in additional file  <dig>  definitions of anatomical directions used here are found in figure  <dig>  identifications of these landmarks on specimens are found in figure  <dig> and in additional file  <dig> 

landmark homology is widely recognized as a critical feature of sparse landmark based morphometrics, although the definition of homology may shift depending on research question and sample  <cit> . previous landmark based studies of mouse embryos between e <dig>  and e <dig>  are typically related to questions of growth and development of facial prominences and the structures derived from them  <cit> . therefore, our landmark set, influenced greatly by this previous work, is composed of points at the borders between or at the extreme edges of prominences and/or other craniofacial features. realizing that the specific cells found at the edges of a facial prominence may shift as it grows outward , we define homology based on the extent of the cellular populations whose proliferation and differentiation serve to modify the form of a given prominence and its derivative craniofacial features.

for example, point 9/ <dig> is placed in a position that is near the ventral/rostral corner of the eye of e <dig>  specimens . based on this geometric relationship with the eye, this landmark might also be placed at the corner of the eye on e <dig>  specimens. however, because our main questions are about the growth and relationship between the facial prominences, it is more important that landmark 9/ <dig> continue to represent the caudal end of the border between the lateral nasal and maxillary processes at the developing lacrimal duct. it has been shown that the valley between the second and third whisker rows, counting from the dorsal aspect of the nose, represents the border between tissues derived from these cell populations  <cit> . therefore, the e <dig>  version of this point was defined at the posterior extreme of this valley between the whisker rows, found halfway up the anterior border of the eye . similarly, we chose age specific locations for each landmark, as defined within the practical definitions, to represent homologous biological features, as defined within the biological definitions.

even if landmarks represent relevant biological features well, landmarks cannot be used to measure subtle variation in craniofacial form if there is a large amount of variation in landmark coordinate identification. in order to test the variation in landmark placement for our landmark set , we measured the intra- and inter-observer error associated with each landmark. after identifying some landmarks with relatively high error, we tested how removing groups of landmarks from our set influences the results of a simple ontogenetic analysis. this latter question addresses the issue of how the composition of the landmark set influences the extent to which the set captures and represents, overall, the shape of the face.

RESULTS
intraobserver error
intraobserver error, the variation in placement of a given landmark from trial to trial by the same person, was measured as the euclidian distance between the identified coordinates of a landmark during two landmark placement trails. after determining that left and right versions of bilateral landmarks showed similar patterns of intraobserver error, calculations of intraobserver error for bilateral landmarks include values from both sides. the median intraobserver error for landmarks taken by the more experienced landmarkers on e <dig>  specimens  tend to be well below  <dig>  mm, usually closer to  <dig>  mm, with the less experienced landmarker showing higher median and variance of error overall. while the more experienced landmarkers display low landmark placement error, the less experienced landmarker displays high median intraobserver error for landmark  <dig> and high variance for 17/ <dig> for e <dig>  embryos , the median intraobserver error for the more experienced landmarkers is still well under  <dig>  mm for most landmarks, although there are some landmarks that display higher error. looking at the more experienced landmarkers, point  <dig> shows the highest median value, while point  <dig> is also high for one experienced observer. of the lateral points, 17/ <dig>  18/ <dig>  and 21/ <dig> median values are above  <dig>  for at least one of the experienced landmarkers. the median intraobserver errors are higher for the e <dig>  embryos then the other two ages , although this might be expected given that the overall dimensions of the head have increased substantially since e <dig> . for e <dig> , landmark 21/ <dig> consistently displays the highest level of error for the experienced landmarkers, while the points 17/ <dig>  18/ <dig>  and 13/ <dig> display median close to  <dig>  mm for at least one experienced landmarker.

interobserver error
interobserver error was calculated for every landmark of every specimen as centroid size of the average landmark locations chosen by the three experienced landmarkers . although centroid size is not directly interpretable as a euclidian distance, centroid size values are comparable between ages in our analysis .

overall, the median and variance of interobserver error is lower for e <dig>  and e <dig>  data than for e <dig>  data. landmarks that were identified as having relatively high intraobserver error across ages, including  <dig>  13/ <dig>  17/ <dig>  18/ <dig>  21/ <dig> are among the landmarks with higher mean interobserver error at e <dig>  and e <dig> . however, the landmark that displays the most interobserver error at e <dig>  and e <dig>  is 7/ <dig>  which showed relatively low intraobserver error. at e <dig> , landmark 17/ <dig>  18/ <dig> and 21/ <dig> display he highest median interobserver error, although 18/ <dig> seems to be much more problematic on the right side than the left.

significance test
a two-way analysis of variance  was carried out for each embryonic age on the distance between each observer’s landmark placement and mean landmark location with observer, specimen, and landmark identity as factors . this was done in order determine the significance of the association of each of these factors with variation in landmark placement. across all three embryonic days, there is a highly significant effect of observer and landmark on the strength of variation in landmark coordinates from the mean coordinates for each specimen. there is a highly significant effect of specimen identity on this coordinate variation at e <dig>  and a significant effect at e <dig> , indicating that some specimens tend to display higher variation in landmark placement between observers at the earlier ages.

two-way anova results for the association between specimen, landmark, and observer factors and variation in identified landmark coordinates for the three embryonic ages. results include degrees of freedom , sum of squares , and p-value, which is highlighted in bold if highly significant . variation in landmark coordinates were calculated as euclidian distances between a given landmark location and the mean location across observers for the same specimen.

ontogenetic analysis
we identified a list of trouble landmarks, based on their high median intra- or inter-observer error values, for which we did not believe a clarification of landmark definition would necessarily reduce error . in order to determine how removing these trouble landmarks or  <dig> other morphologically defined landmark groups from our sample would modify the results of a simple ontogenetic analysis, we completed separate regressions of landmark coordinates on centroid size for five subsets of landmarks within morphoj .the association between a summary regression score and centroid size is roughly linear for each of the five regressions completed . the proportion of the total variation for which the regression including all landmarks accounts is approximately  <dig> %, while it is  <dig> % when the trouble landmarks are removed,  <dig> % with nasal landmarks removed,  <dig> % with maxillary/mandibular landmarks removed, and  <dig> % with non-facial landmarks removed. based on a subjective comparison of the shape vectors associated with each regression, the removal of any of these subsets of landmarks does not grossly change the nature of the allometric shape change of a given landmark during the developmental period under study . as the embryo develops between e <dig>  and e <dig> , the bilateral landmarks of the face become relatively more rostral and closer together. the facial landmarks closer to the midline also become relatively more ventral by e <dig> . the landmarks found away from the face are relatively more caudal and dorsal in the older specimens.

discussion
intra- and inter-observer error
bookstein  <cit>  defined a commonly used landmark classification system based on the features used to determine landmark location. type  <dig> landmarks are defined as the location of a discrete anatomical structure, independent of other anatomical features. several of the landmarks in our set  are type  <dig>  including 8/ <dig> that is found at the intersection of the eye, forebrain, and lateral nasal prominence. type  <dig> landmarks are extreme points along curves or grooves and represent the majority of landmarks defined on the surfaces of embryos for this and previously defined sets . type  <dig> landmarks, those defined with respect to relatively distant anatomical structures, do not necessarily share biological meaning and homology across specimens. they are considered mathematically deficient, because their locations are partially dependent on the locations of other anatomical structures  <cit> . however, because type  <dig> and type  <dig> landmarks cannot comprehensively represent the shape of the early facial prominences  <cit> , we defined a few landmarks on the extreme of craniofacial bulges in order to improve our coverage of the anatomical features of interest. because the face develops quickly between e <dig>  and e <dig>  , biologically homologous landmarks may switch between landmark types across this period of development. for example, landmark 17/ <dig> is the extreme lateral edge of the maxillary prominence at e <dig>  and e <dig>  , but is defined based on location between whisker rows at e <dig>  . even if a landmark does not change type, the error associated with its identification may change across this developmental period.

our landmark set was compiled with the goals of 1) creating an explicit homologous association between each landmark and a biological feature across e <dig> -e <dig>  and 2) serving as the basis for ontogenetic analyses that include datasets produced by multiple observers. therefore, we have attempted to choose landmarks that represent relevant biological features well and which can be repeatably placed between trials and by multiple observers. however, we acknowledge that a given landmark may not necessarily be more biologically relevant or repeatable than other nearby locations, particularly if the landmark is defined along a curve or curved surface . we have endeavored to transparently report our biological interpretations of landmarks and the repeatability of landmark placement in order to allow other researchers to judge the usefulness of this landmark set for their own studies.

none of the landmarks identified as having high intra- or inter-observer error in this study are type  <dig> landmarks. instead, they tend to be type  <dig> landmarks along curves with wide inflection  or type  <dig> landmarks on the extreme extents of bulges . after reviewing the landmarks identified as having high error  we are confident that we can clarify the definitions of 10/ <dig> and 13/ <dig> in order to reduce landmark placement error, based on noted systematic differences in placement between landmarkers. however, we suggest that  <dig>  7/ <dig>  17/ <dig>  18/ <dig>  and 21/ <dig> be removed from our standardized landmark set for e <dig> -e <dig>  mice. this does not mean that these landmarks are necessarily inappropriate for a specific embryonic age or as an additional landmark for studies that include only one observer. for instance, landmark 7/ <dig> displays high interobserver error and relatively low intraobserver error for the experienced observers, suggesting that observers developed their own stable  interpretations of the landmark. similarly, the median intraobserver error across the three experienced landmarkers increases for landmark 21/ <dig> from e <dig>  to e <dig>  as the forebrain expands, suggesting that the landmark may be appropriate for use at e <dig>  but not at e <dig> .

after removing trouble landmarks from our landmark set, and assuming minimal modification of craniofacial shape during preparation and imaging of specimens  <cit> , median intraobserver error of our experienced landmarkers is below  <dig>  mm. in the case of e <dig>  specimens, it tends to be below  <dig>  mm. therefore, the application of this landmark set by an experienced landmarker should allow the capture of differences in facial shape between groups of specimens that are significantly larger than  <dig>  mm. for comparative purposes, the width of the ridge lateral to the nasal aperture is  <dig>  mm at e <dig> , while the width of the nasal aperture measured from the rostro-ventral extent of the lateral and medial ridges is  <dig>  mm at e <dig> . the significantly higher intraobserver error noted for the first time landmarker highlights the need for landmark training and experience in order to reduce error to acceptable levels.

one of the major reasons to design this standard set of landmarks was to allow landmarks taken by multiple observers to be combined in comparative analyses. unfortunately, the interobserver error noted for many landmarks indicates significant differences in the interpretation of landmark definitions even though we provided precise biological and practical landmark definitions, examples of landmarks identified on a 3d craniofacial surface for each age, illustrations of standard head orientation, and face to face discussion. measures of interobserver error can illustrate the need for further clarification of certain landmark definitions or the removal of a landmark from analysis entirely. alternatively, assuming that there is high interobserver and low intraobserver error, it may be possible to remove typical differences in interobserver landmark placement via regression of landmark coordinate values on observer identity. while completely removing interobserver landmark error may not be possible, comparative error studies like this are highly recommended in order to identify and address problematic landmarks as a way to reduce the level of landmark placement error included within subsequent analyses.

the variation in landmark placement, measured as the distance between an observer’s landmark coordinates and mean landmark coordinates, is strongly associated with the factors of landmark and observer identity at e <dig> , e <dig> , and e <dig> , according to our two-way anova analysis. specimen identity is associated with landmark variation at e <dig>  and e <dig> , although with reduced significance at e <dig>  . the significant effect of observer identity on landmark coordinate variation indicates that significant differences in landmark placement exist between observers for at least some of the landmarks. the significant effect of landmark identity suggests that this interobserver variation in landmark placement is higher for some landmarks than others. although significant at all three embryonic days, the sum of squares values for both observer and landmark increase from e <dig>  through e <dig> , which matches the observation that mean inter- and intra-observer error values tend to increase from e <dig>  to e <dig>  . the significant effect of specimen identity in the earlier ages does not suggest that interobserver error is higher for younger specimens. it merely suggests that the level of interobserver error varies between specimens at the younger ages. this difference in landmark placement error may be associated with larger relative differences in morphology between specimens at slightly different stages of development within the younger age categories. it may also be due to relatively more significant fixation based changes in morphology within some younger specimens.

interpreting ontogenetic analyses
another major reason to define this set of landmarks was as a basis for ontogenetic analyses of craniofacial shape in mice between e <dig>  and e <dig> . therefore, we carried out a series of linear regressions between size and shape in order to determine how the selection of landmarks might influence the results and interpretation of this type of analysis. omitting major groups of landmarks from these regressions did not substantially modify the nature of the craniofacial shape change associated with an increase in centroid size between e <dig>  and e <dig> , suggesting that the specific landmarks selected should not influence interpretation of shape change across this ontogenetic period.

however, removing the non-facial or trouble landmarks from the dataset reduced the linearity between landmark coordinate regression coefficients and centroid size, as well as the total landmark coordinate variation explained by the regression on centroid size. in our regressions, centroid size is a proxy for developmental age. between e <dig>  and e <dig> , the growth of the facial prominences outward is not as pronounced as the growth and definition of the various regions of the brain  <cit>  . the lower explanatory power of the regression when non-facial landmarks were removed suggests that including these landmarks improves the usefulness of centroid size as a proxy for developmental age, because it is linked to the overall change in craniofacial size over this developmental period. the intermediate reduction in explanatory power for the regression when the trouble landmarks were removed is likely based on the fact that a high proportion of the trouble landmarks are non-facial landmarks.

we recommend that landmarks across the head be included in ontogenetic analyses in order to better estimate centroid size as a measure of developmental age, but also to provide a broader anatomical context within which to interpret morphological changes of the face or another specific region of interest. if possible, using a measure of developmental age that is independent of the landmarks under analysis, such as tail somite number, may be preferable  <cit> .

future directions
great progress has been made in the automation of craniofacial surface quantification and comparison , which might make issues of intra- and inter-observer landmark placement error irrelevant. however, despite significant effort, an adequate automatic method has not yet been developed that allows for the quantification of subtle craniofacial variation in young embryos. this is partially due to difficulty in producing standardized and complete ectodermal surfaces from μct images, as well as the fact that craniofacial features change very quickly during embryonic development to the point where a great deal of variation exists within a sample of specimens from a single embryonic day. the human eye remains, unfortunately, superior to computational methods in locating homologous features on incomplete surfaces and across gradations of developmental age. the authors are involved in work to automate embryonic landmark placement, but must continue to rely on manual placement of landmark sets like this for the time being.

CONCLUSIONS
standardization of landmarking protocols is a necessary first step, but not sufficient for phenotypic data to become phenomic data. it must also be shown that the landmark coordinates identified using the standard protocol are sufficiently comparable between landmark trials and between observers. we developed and tested a set of ectodermal surface landmarks for the measurement of craniofacial morphology of mice between e <dig> , e <dig> , and e <dig> . our package of landmark definitions, illustrations, and examples were developed in an effort to reduce variation in placement for all landmarks in our set. measurements of intra- and inter-observer error for four observers reinforce the idea that landmark coordinates identified from one landmarker will have less variability than landmarks taken by multiple observers. intraobserver error comparisons also highlight the need for landmarkers to be provided significant training and supervision before the incorporation of their landmark sets into larger meta-analyses including multiple observers. however, we are confident that this standard landmark set, once landmarks with higher error are removed, can serve as a basis for the comparison of landmarks individually collected by experienced landmarkers for different mouse strains and disease models. finally, our results suggest that the nature of craniofacial shape changes identified with simple ontogenetic analyses are robust to the particular choice of landmarks that are included in those analyses. by using these landmarks within a variety of future studies, perhaps as part of larger study or age specific landmark sets, we plan to build a dataset for the comparison of facial morphogenesis across many mouse populations in order to help identify the developmental bases for phenotypic variation in the craniofacial complex.
