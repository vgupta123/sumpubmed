BACKGROUND
beauveria vuill. is a globally distributed genus of soil-borne entomopathogenic hyphomycetes that is preferred as a model system for the study of entomopathogenesis and the biological control of pest insects  <cit> . the most abundant species of the genus is beauveria bassiana, found in a wide host range of nearly  <dig> insect species, with extended studies on host-pathogen interactions at the molecular level and all the prerequisite knowledge for its commercial production  <cit> . b. brongniartii, the second most common species of the genus, has narrow host specificity and is well-studied as the pathogen of the european cockchafer , a pest in permanent grasslands and orchards  <cit> . strains of both fungal species have been exploited as biological control agents   <cit> .

as is usually the case for most mitosporic fungi, morphological characters are inadequate for delimiting species within a genus and this creates a continuing demand of screening for additional taxonomic characters. consequently, through the years, several efforts have been made to genetically characterize or differentiate beauveria species and strains, using various tools, including isozyme markers  <cit> , karyotyping  <cit> , vegetative compatibility groups  <cit> , rapd markers  <cit> , rrna gene sequencing and intron analyses  <cit> , rflps and aflps  <cit> , subtilisin protease genes  <cit> , microsatellites  <cit>  and combinations of rrna gene complex and other nuclear genes  <cit> . these approaches provided valuable information on polymorphisms in populations of b. bassiana, with its sequences combined with other nuclear gene sequences being more reliable in taxonomic and phylogenetic studies  <cit> . consequently, earlier assumptions that beauveria is strictly asexual have been severely hampered by the recent discoveries of cordyceps teleomorphs associated with beauveria  <cit> . thus, the extent to which the entire beauveria genus is correlated with sexual cordyceps remains to be examined and proved  <cit> .

mitochondrial dna , due to its properties to evolve faster than the nuclear dna, to contain introns and mobile elements and to exhibit extensive polymorphisms, has been increasingly used to examine genetic diversity within fungal populations  <cit> . in other mitosporic entomopathogenic fungi, such as metarhizium  <cit> , lecanicillium  <cit>  and nomurea  <cit> , mtdna data compared favourably to data based on its combined with a single nuclear gene, for applications in phylogeny, taxonomy and species or strain -identification. in beauveria, the use of mtdna rflps or partial mtdna sequences suggested that mtdna can be equally useful for such studies  <cit> .

in recent years, molecular techniques have revolutionized taxonomical studies and have provided strong evidence that some morphologically defined species consist of a number of cryptic species that are independent lineages with restricted distributions, for example, metarhizium anisopliae  <cit> , neurospora crassa  <cit> , and pleurotus cystidiosus  <cit> . this has urged mycologists to extend their studies on large samples of individuals throughout the world, in order to establish robust phylogenies from the congruence of genealogies based on appropriately polymorphic gene sequences and to test hypotheses regarding the processes responsible for distribution patterns. thus, the notion of phylogenetic species recognition and phylogeography was introduced as a powerful method for answering questions about distribution in an evolutionary context  <cit> . phylogeography or phylogenetic biogeography emerge as the field that aims to understand the processes shaping geographic distributions of lineages using genealogies of populations and genes  <cit> . it is therefore, particularly important for genera like beauveria for which only a few studies exist on strain variability and their geographic distribution and phylogenetic origins  <cit> .

this work was undertaken to serve a dual purpose. firstly, to further assess the usefulness of mtdna sequences as species diagnostic tool, alone or in combination with the more commonly studied rrna gene sequences , and secondly to infer relationships among a large population of beauveria species and strains from different geographic origins, habitats and insect hosts. to achieve these targets we have analyzed the complete mt genomes of b. bassiana and b. brongniartii, selected the two most variable intergenic regions and constructed the phylogenetic relationships of a number of isolates for determining their biogeographic correlation.

RESULTS
gene content and genome organization
the mt genomes of the two beauveria species had similar sizes, i.e., b. brongniartii imbst  <dig>  <dig>  bp and b. bassiana bb <dig>  <dig>  bp, and both mapped circularly . they contained all the expected genes found in typical mt genomes of ascomycetes . both genomes were compact and preserved the four synteny units proposed for sordariomycetes, i.e., rns-trn-cox3-trn-nad6-trn; nad1-nad4-atp8-atp6; rnl-trn-nad2-nad <dig> and nad4l-nad5-cob-cox <dig>  <cit> . important deduced differences in the gene content of the two genomes were found only when the intron number and insertion sites were included. this was also the case for mtdna genome sequence of another b. bassiana isolate  from china, recently deposited in genbank . when compared with our bb <dig> mtdna genome sequence, the two genomes were identical in gene order and nucleotide sequence , for most of their sequence . the difference in size -approx.  <dig>  kb- was due to the absence from bb <dig> of two introns, located in cox <dig> and nad <dig> genes of bb <dig>  minor sequence differences were mostly in the intergenic regions with a preference to at-rich areas, and were to a large extent snp transitions  or single nucleotide insertions or deletions. the remaining differences were due to small insertions or deletions of 5- <dig> bp. the largest deletion  and the lowest sequence homology  were observed in the intergenic region cox1- trnr <dig> .

introns
b. bassiana bb <dig> contained five and b. brongniartii six introns, contributing to their total mtdna genome size by  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. all introns were group-i members, located in rnl, cob, cox <dig>  cox <dig> and nad <dig> . all introns contained orfs, i.e., the rps <dig> homolog within the rnl gene , putative giy-yig homing endonucleases  and the lagli-dadg endonuclease . the insertion positions of these introns were found to be conserved  for all known fungal complete mt genomes examined . the only exception was the cox <dig> intron which was rarely encountered in other fungi. interestingly, the additional intron detected in rnl of the b. brongniartii imbst  <dig> mt genome , was inserted at site not encountered before among the other complete mt genomes, i.e., the stem formed in domain ii of rnl 's secondary structure. the target insertion sequence for the intron was gataaggttg↓tgtatgtcaa and its intronic orf encoded for a giy-yig endonuclease which shared homology  with i-pci endonuclease of podospora curvicolla .

intergenic regions
both mt genomes contained  <dig> intergenic regions amounting for  <dig>  bp in b. bassiana and  <dig>  bp in b. brongniartii, and corresponding to  <dig> % and  <dig> % of their total mt genome, respectively. the a+t content was very similar for these regions in both mt genomes  and the largest intergenic region was located between cox1-trnr <dig> with sizes  <dig>  bp for b. bassiana and  <dig>  bp for b. brongniartii, respectively. analysis of these particular regions revealed large unique putative orfs  with no significant similarity to any other orfs in genbank. additionally, many direct repeats were also located in the same regions . all other intergenic regions in the two mt genomes had approximately the same sizes but with reduced nucleotide identity . therefore, the potential usefulness of mt intergenic sequence variation for intra- and inter- species discrimination and phylogenetic studies of beauveria was examined following an in silico analysis based on criteria of size, complexity and suitability  of all beauveria mt intergenic regions. more specifically, smaller than  <dig> bp interenic regions were excluded due to the few informative characters they contained, whereas ideal regions were considered those with sizes between 200- <dig> bp because they can be easily cloned and/or obtained by pcr. regions containing trn genes -due to their cloverleaf structures- and regions with dispersed repetitive elements were avoided because their structures make them unsuitable for designing primers for pcr amplification . thus, the most suitable intergenic regions following the above criteria for the population analyses were nad3-atp <dig> and atp6-rns.

population and phylogenetic studies based on its1- <dig> s-its <dig> and intergenic mt region sequences
pcr amplicons for the its1- <dig> s-its <dig> region showed little variation in size, being almost identical for all b. bassiana  and b. brongniartii  isolates, but with sizeable differences for the other beauveria species . on the contrary, the intergenic nad3-atp <dig> and atp6-rns amplicons exhibited a much greater variability in sizes even within b. bassiana isolates, ranging from 259- <dig> bp for the former and 283- <dig> bp for the latter , thus providing excellent tools for species or species-group identification. for example, using high-resolution agarose electrophoresis , nad3-atp <dig> b. bassiana amplicons can be easily differentiated from the other beauveria species and at the same time can be grouped into clades a and c according to their sizes and in congruence to the classification proposed earlier  <cit>  . variability for the other beauveria species was even greater, ranging from 84- <dig> bp and 249- <dig> bp for the nad3-atp <dig> and atp6-rns, respectively. when analyzed, these differences were found to be mainly due to deletions and/or additions of 3- <dig> nucleotides for nad3-atp <dig>  scattered throughout this region, and rarely due to single point mutations. the atp6-rns sequence differences were primarily due to a 4-bp repeat  inserted in the corresponding sequence up to  <dig> times , thus providing in many cases excellent tools for isolate identification.

amplicon sequences from all isolates listed in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> were used to draw phylogenetic trees deduced from nj analyses , and parsimony and bayesian methods were applied to examine the sensitivity of the resulting trees and tree topologies. trees remained largely invariant to these manipulations and topologies were similar to a significant extent for each gene region tested independently of the phylogenetic method applied . trees were rooted using as outgroups aschershonia sp. and/or simplicillium lamelicolla . specifically, the phylogenetic tree produced from the its1- <dig> s-its <dig> sequences obtained in this work and known related sequences from the databanks, divided the majority of b. bassiana strains into two major clades , with marginal support of each clade . the only exception was three strains  that grouped together, at the base of the remaining b. bassiana strains with significant bootstrap  and posterior probability support . similarly, the three b. brongniartii strains, grouped with the respective sequences obtained from genebank and produced a sister clade to b. bassiana, whereas the b. vermiconia and b. amorpha strains were basal to b. bassiana and b. brongniartii . they all clearly clustered to a group different from the other species of the order hypocreales, with significant nj  and mp  bootstrap support. based on  <dig> informative characters,  <dig>  most parsimonious trees were constructed with tree length of  <dig>  steps . the relatively small number of informative characters may explain the marginal mp bootstrap and pp support. the remaining previously known beauveria species  grouped well with other tolypocladium species as expected according to known taxonomic criteria  <cit> .

both mt intergenic regions were more variable than the nuclear its1- <dig> s-its <dig> for the b. bassiana strains. mp analyses were based on  <dig> and  <dig> informative characters and produced  <dig>  most parsimonious trees with tree lengths  <dig>  and  <dig>  steps  for the nad3-atp <dig> and atp6-rns regions, respectively. b. bassiana strains clustered into the same two groups  and again the three isolates  were placed as a separate group, as in the its1- <dig> s-its <dig> trees . strains of b. brongniartii were basal to those of b. bassiana with a significant bootstrap and posterior probability support  in the nad3-atp <dig> analysis , while in the atp6-rns tree they presented an identical topology to the its dataset, as a sister species to clade a with a 100% support for all methods applied . here again, beauveria species were clearly differentiated from other hypocreales species, with significant support . in addition, mt datasets provided better support of clade c b. bassiana strains than their nuclear counterpart, i.e., nj  and mp  bootstrap support for the nad3-atp <dig> dataset , and 83% and 100%, respectively, for atp6-rns . for both mt intergenic regions clade c b. bassiana strains clustered as a sister group with the two b. vermiconia strains , with the addition of the three independent b. bassiana isolates in the case of nad3-atp <dig> 

in relation to insect host order, a "loose host-associated cluster" was observed only for clade a strains, whereas clade c b. bassiana strains were more diverse and no relation to host origin could be detected. interestingly, the association of b. bassiana strain clusters with their insect host origin was more consistent with the nad3-atp <dig> data, than with data derived from atp6-rns analysis.

concatenated sequence analysis and evidence for host and climate associations of the clades
to fully integrate and exploit all the above information, a tree was constructed based on the concatenated its1- <dig> s-its <dig>  atp6-rns and nad3-atp <dig> sequences. parsimony analysis provided more than  <dig>  trees after exploiting  <dig> informative characters and the tree length was based on  <dig>  steps . analysis of the same dataset with nj and bi methods produced similar trees with identical topologies wherever there was a strong support . as in every tree produced by the analysis of a single gene region, b. bassiana strains grouped again into the same two major groups. the three isolates that were placed basally to the remaining b. bassiana remained independent, with significant bootstrap support . the most interesting feature of the concatenated data tree was that b. bassiana strains of clade a could be divided further into seven distinct sub-groups that showed a "loose" association with their host . this association was strengthened if the fungi were clustered according to their geographic and climatic origin . more precisely, sub-groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> contained strains from europe with five, nine, three and twelve members, respectively . sub-group  <dig> strains were derived from france, hungary and spain . they were all isolated from a lepidopteran host and originated from temperate maritime and continental microthermal climates  according to the köppen-geiger classification  <cit> . the three strains of sub-group  <dig> were isolated from oceania . to these, an indian , a chinese  and a spanish  strain were also added, i.e., fungal strains from regions with temperate humid subtropic and mediterranean climates, resembling the climate of the oceanic cfa  <cit> . sub-groups  <dig> and  <dig> consisted almost exclusively of european strains  from regions with mediterranean climate, such as spain, portugal and italy. on the other hand,  <dig> strains from regions of europe with maritime temperate climates  formed a well-supported group  presented as sub-group  <dig>  all nine strains of sub-group  <dig> were from regions with dry arid, semiarid  and temperate  climates in asia and europe, while the south american  from tropic  and dry arid/semiarid  climates may be named as sub-group  <dig> 

discussion
fungal mt genome size shows high divergence among the pezizomycotina, ranging from  <dig>  kb for podospora anserina  to  <dig>  kb for the entomopathogen lecanicillium muscarium . beauveria mt genomes sizes were similar to those of other fungi of the order hypocreales, e.g., fusarium oxysporum  and hypocrea jecorina , but they were significantly larger  than the mt genomes of the other two known entomopathogenic fungi of the order, i.e., m. anisopliae   <cit>  and l. muscarium   <cit> . since the beauveria mtdnas contained the same protein and rrna coding genes -also identical in sizes- with all above mt genomes, their larger sizes can be attributed to more introns and to longer intergenic regions.

compared to mt genomes of plants and animals, fungal mt genomes are significantly richer in group i and ii introns  <cit> . divergence in intron content is a common feature among mt genomes of pezizomycotina. at one extreme is the mt genome of p. anserina which contains  <dig> introns  <cit>  and at the other are several fungi that contain a single intron in the rnl genes of their mt genomes . the recently released mt genome of another b. bassiana isolate  also presented fewer introns than the genomes that we analyzed. these data support and extend previous evidence for intronic variability among strains of the same beauveria species  <cit> . however, introns usually share common futures like insertion sites, encoded orfs and total length  <cit> . exceptions are noteworthy, not only because they suggest tools for the discrimination of the fungus but also because they provide information valuable to our understanding of fungal evolution  <cit> . in that respect, intron bbrrnl <dig> inserted within domain ii of rnl's secondary structure was located in a novel  site amongst the  <dig> ascomycota complete mt genomes examined . even though introns have been found in the same domain in basidiomycota, for example agrocybe aegerita  <cit> , the uniqueness of this insertion site is of great importance to ascomycetes, as it may be a result of horizontal intron transfer. the fact that this intron encodes for a giy-yig homing endonuclease which shares homology with orfs in introns located in different genes in other fungal genomes further strengthens the hypothesis of horizontal transfer. yet, such a hypothesis remains to be experimentally tested.

recently, a thorough attempt was made to determine associations of morphological characteristics with molecular data in beauveria species  <cit> . based on its1- <dig> s-its <dig> and ef-1a sequences  <dig> exemplar isolates were examined and assigned to six major clades , where all known beauveria species were included. b. bassiana isolates were grouped into two unrelated and morphologically indistinguishable clades , while b. brongniartii formed a third sister clade to the other two . a new species, b. malawiensis, was later introduced and placed as sister clade to clade e  <cit> , and several other b. bassiana isolates pathogenic to the coffee berry borer from africa and the neotropics were added to clades a and c  <cit> . our results from the its1- <dig> s-its <dig> dataset are in full agreement with the grouping into clades a-c and this division of b. bassiana isolates into two distinct clades is further supported by the mt intergenic region and the concatenated datasets with the best so far known bootstrap values. mt genomes present different evolutionary rates compared to the nuclear  <cit>  and topologies provided by one evolutionary pathway may not always indicate the correct relationships. as indicated by our findings, combining information from two independent heritages  may offer the possibility to resolve phylogenetic ambiguities. thus, the two unrelated and morphologically indistinguishable b. bassiana clades proposed by rehner and buckley  <cit> , i.e., the "b. bassiana s.l.", which contains the authentic b. bassiana , and the "pseudobassiana" clade, which remains to be described , are fully supported by our combined mt and nuclear data. equally well supported by bootstrap is the placement of b. brongniartii strains as a sister clade to b. bassiana. the consistent clustering of the three b. bassiana isolates , which grouped basally to other b. bassiana with any datasets, indicates that this group is possibly a cryptic complex of b. bassiana. experimental work with these and other similar isolates will be needed to substantiate this hypothesis.

a generally accepted notion that insect hosts are related to certain genotypes of entomopathogenic fungi has been tested in several occasions in the past for b. bassiana and b. brongniartii. however, only a few cases supported a host - fungal genotype specificity. for instance, associations have been reported between b. brongniartii and melolontha melolontha, m. hippocastani or hoplochelus marginalis  <cit> . a common b. bassiana genotype was detected in isolates from ostrinia nubilalis  <cit>  and from alphitobius diaperinus  <cit> . more often, b. bassiana isolates collected from the same insect species were found to be genetically dissimilar  <cit>  or showed cross-infectivity  <cit> . similarly, fungal isolates derived from different insect species, families or orders clustered together  <cit> . our results from the concatenated mt and nuclear gene datasets come to an agreement with the latter view, since molecular variability showed no general correlation between strains and host and/or geographic origin. this indicates that b. bassiana is a generalized insect pathogen, and is in agreement which its world-wide distribution, the vast variety of hosts from which it has been isolated and its entomopathogenic and/or endophytic characteristics  <cit> . it is only in rare occasions that a particular genotype, like clade a sub-group  <dig> isolates , may be associated with a particular host . in the case of b. brongniartii and under the light of previous analyses of larger fungal populations  <cit> , the association between fungal genotypes and a particular host seem to be stricter.

data obtained from the phylogenetic analyses of the nuclear its1- <dig> s-its <dig> and the two mitochondrial intergenic regions atp6-rns and nad3-atp <dig> for all isolates examined in this study.

an increasing number of studies point towards a broad correlation of fungal isolates with their place of origin and/or habitats . obviously, the factors that can influence b. bassiana population structures are many and can include: climate conditions, the range of temperatures in which the various isolates can grow in nature, humidity levels, uv exposure, habitat, cropping system and soil properties  <cit> . in addition, collection strategies, numbers of isolates tested, gene loci used and molecular methods applied for population analyses can greatly contribute to the variability recorded. thus, although the description of the effects of a single variable on the population of entomopathogenic fungi in a habitat can give significant and useful ecological and agronomical information, there may be relationships among the different variables that must be studied in detail to adequately understand the source of genetic variability in these fungi  <cit> . therefore, to increase our potential to detect correlations between molecular markers and environmental variables, we incorporated climate conditions in our analyses, based on the most widely accepted classification system, the köppen-geiger climate classification  <cit> . this approach allowed fungal isolates that were otherwise outside of a particular cluster to be embodied in this cluster. also, with few exceptions, strains isolated from distant geographic regions, which however shared similar climatic conditions, clustered together. if an explanation had to be proposed, the isolation by distance  cannot be ruled out  <cit> . during the last decade molecular phylogenetic studies concerning fungal taxa which are considered to be widespread have resulted in the recognition of allopatric cryptic sibling species  <cit> . the suggestion that some morphologically defined species consist of a number of cryptic species that are independent lineages with restricted distributions  <cit> , may explain the phylogeographic distribution of the three b. bassiana isolates designated in group a <dig> in this work. in other words, even though they are morphologically indistinguishable from the rest b. bassiana isolates, all three have the same host and are originated from asia  with similar climate .

it may be argued, and indeed it is the case, that the fungal isolates studied in this work are geographically "biased", since they are predominantly isolated from insects found in europe  and asia , and to a lesser extend from other places in north and south america, africa and oceania . however, even with this worldwide distribution of the isolates studied, continental drifts, geological barriers, host restrictions and human activities may contribute to long-distance dispersal and result to mixed sub-grouping classification. for instance, sub-group  <dig>  contains the oceanic isolates, one from india and one from britain. while the "indian" isolate may be considered as an evolutionary result of the opening of the weddell sea when eastern  and western gondwana  separated  <cit> , the "british" isolate may only be explained by accepting long-distance dispersal due to the human intervention as the most probable way. in similar studies where fungal distribution was caused by the breakup of pangaea to new and old world, like the pleurotus cystidiosus group  <cit> , schizophyllum  <cit>  and lentinula  <cit> , several exceptions to this pattern were observed in each study and they were usually explained by rare, but recent long - distance dispersal. thus, gene flow among geographically distant populations of b. bassiana may be attributed to the long-distance dispersal of fungal spores through a variety of different direct or indirect means including wind, migratory insect vectors, rainfall, flooding and human traffic. on the other hand, the fact that several b. bassiana isolates belonging to different phylogenetic clades have been found in the same geographic location  may indicate a sympatric diversification. there appears to be no single morphological, physiological, host range, or genetic marker characteristic that can alone resolve molecular phylogenies in b. bassiana. therefore, a strictly vicariant scenario may be not supported with these datasets and the occurrence of long - distance dispersal may be an alternate feasible scenario which renders the genus beauveria cosmopolitan with several cryptic species, as already have been shown in other fungal taxa  <cit> . nevertheless, in view of the ecological complexities of this entomopathogenic fungus, it is evident that terminal lineages can only be found if experiments are performed using more hierarchical parameters  in combination with multiple gene analyses that include data both from nuclear and mitochondrial genes.

CONCLUSIONS
the complete mt genomes of b. bassiana and b. brongniartii analysed in this work had the typical gene content and organization found in other ascomycetes of the order hypocreales, but contained more introns and longer intergenic regions. the latter features can serve as tools for inter- and intra- species specific analysis within the genus beauveria. two mt intergenic regions  provided valuable sequence information and good support for the discrimination of beauveria species and the division of  <dig> b. bassiana isolates into two groups, namely the b. bassiana sensu lato and the b. bassiana "pseudo-bassiana". these findings were in agreement with phylogenetic inferences based on its1- <dig> s-its <dig> and demonstrated that mt sequences can be equally useful with the universally approved its1- <dig> s-its <dig> for phylogenetic analysis. further, mt sequence phylogenies constantly supported the formation of a third b. bassiana group, clearly differentiated from the rest, thus hinting for the presence of cryptic species within b. bassiana. concatenated data sets of sequences from the three regions studied  supported the above conclusions and often combined with criteria of isolate and geographic and climatic origins offered a better resolution of the b. bassiana s.l. strains and showed for the first time in entomopathogenic fungi, that b. bassiana s.l. strains can be subdivided into seven distinct sub-groups with common climate characteristics.
