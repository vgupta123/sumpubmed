BACKGROUND
up to date, the tropical disease malaria is one of the most devastating infectious diseases in the world, causing  <dig> million new cases and approximately  <dig>  casualties each year  <cit> . disease treatment and control measures are undermined by the spread of drug resistance in malaria parasites, particularly in populations of plasmodium falciparum, the agent responsible for malaria tropica .

the transmission of malaria parasites from the human to the mosquito is mediated by specialized sexual precursor cells, the intraerythrocytic gametocytes. maturation of p. falciparum gametocytes from stage i to stage v takes approximately  <dig> days, and during this period the gametocytes maintain a stable cell cycle arrest . the mature gametocytes circulate in the humanâ€™s blood stream, but remain dormant until they are taken up by a blood-feeding mosquito.

when entering the mosquito midgut together with the blood meal, the gametocytes become activated from the dormant stage by external stimuli, i.e. a drop in temperature and the contact with the mosquito-derived molecule xanthurenic acid  . gametocyte activation leads to rounding up of the cell, followed by parasite egress from the enveloping erythrocyte, which involves the rupture of two membranes, the parasitophorous vacuole membrane  and the erythrocyte membrane  <cit>  . during gametogenesis the microgametocyte replicates its genome three times in order to produce eight motile microgametes. following the fusion of micro- and macrogametes a zygote forms and develops into an infective ookinete within the following  <dig> hours. the motile ookinete possesses an apical complex which enables it to traverse the midgut epithelium before settling down and forming an oocyst between epithelium and basal lamina .

during gametocytogenesis, p. falciparum expresses a new set of genes important for sexual development  <cit> . ingestion by the blood-feeding mosquito again triggers molecular changes in the sexual stage parasites, which help adjusting the gametocytes to the insect and which on the one hand initiate sexual reproduction and further development of the parasite in the vector, on the other hand prepare the emerging gametes for the hostile environment of the mosquito midgut. noteworthy, the midgut stages have to persevere outside a host cell for more than one day. during this time period, the cells are highly vulnerable to the aggressive factors of the gut, which among others include bacteria as well as human immune cells, antibodies and complement proteins present in the blood meal, and this exposure results in an approximate 1000-fold loss of parasite abundance  <cit>  .

gametocyte maturation and gametogenesis are particularly accompanied by the coordinated expression of numerous adhesive surface proteins, including the egf domain-containing proteins pfs <dig> and pfs <dig>  the 6-cys proteins pfs <dig> and pfs48/ <dig>  and the lccl domain-containing pfccp proteins. it is noteworthy that the majority of these proteins can be divided into two classes: one class of the adhesion proteins, including pfs <dig>  pfs48/ <dig> and the six pfccp proteins, is expressed within the parasitophorous vacuole  of the developing gametocyte, and the majority of these proteins assemble to multimeric protein complexes  <cit>  . the adhesion proteins are subsequently present on the gamete surface, but expression of these proteins usually ceases during fertilization. the expression of the second class of surface proteins starts following parasite transmission to the mosquito, as was shown for pfs <dig> and pfs <dig>  and expression often persists until the ookinete has formed . one reason for this sudden onset of protein expression following gametocyte activation in the mosquito midgut is the translational repression of messenger rna  encoding for some of these proteins. this was inter alia shown in the rodent malaria parasite p. berghei for the repression of pbs <dig> and pbs <dig> by the rna helicase dozi  as part of a ribonucleoprotein complex  <cit> . dozi and its subsequently identified interaction partner cith  are considered repressors of maternally supplied mrna important for ookinete development  <cit> .

while astonishing advances have been made in previous years in unveiling the molecular basis of parasite transmission from the mammalian host to the mosquito, the currently available data are fragmented and major key players for gametogenesis and adaptation have not yet been identified. we thus aimed at investigating the changes in transcript levels during gametocyte activation in order to gain in-depth knowledge on the molecular switch-over that takes place in the parasite during transmission. we selected the suppression subtractive hybridization  technique to experimentally screen for genes differentially expressed during gametocyte activation, because this pcr-based method amplifies induced genes while simultaneously suppressing house-keeping genes, and is thus particularly suited to discover new or unexpected genes  <cit> . our data provide insights into the regulated gene expression of malaria parasites during transmission to the mosquito and enable the identification of novel proteins with essential functions for the mosquito midgut stages, which might be suitable targets for transmission blocking interventions.

RESULTS
to determine changes in the transcriptome of malaria parasites during the initial phase of transmission to the mosquito, we conducted a ssh on mrna isolated from mature non-activated gametocytes and from gametocytes at  <dig> min after in vitro activation, which have completed gametogenesis  <cit> . a subtracted cdna library was constructed and the resulting cdna was assigned to the respective plasmodial genes.

we identified a total number of  <dig> genes, for which expression levels changed in the gametocytes during activation. the majority of genes can be assigned to six major ontology groups :  <dig> genes  have putative functions in signaling,  <dig> genes  are assigned to processes linked to cell cycle and gene expression,  <dig> genes  can be linked to the cytoskeleton or the inner membrane complex ,  <dig> genes  have putative functions in protein trafficking, stabilization and degradation , eight genes  are linked to general metabolic functions, and  <dig> genes  are proteins of the cell surface or pvm. furthermore,  <dig> genes  can be assigned to other functions, including protein synthesis and processing. a total of  <dig> genes  encode for proteins with unknown function, eight of which have sequences for transmembrane domains and five of which encode for a signal peptide.

roughly 60%  of the ssh genes have been detected in the currently available p. falciparum gametocyte proteomes, while for 40% there is as yet no protein evidence   <cit> . almost identical numbers apply to the  <dig> orthologs of the rodent malaria parasite p. berghei; the  <dig> p. falciparum genes without p. berghei orthologs include amongst others the three etramp genes, pfs <dig> and resa.

the p. berghei orthologs of the identified p. falciparum genes were compared with a global gametocyte transcriptome analysis of p. berghei dozi and cith gene deletion mutants; destabilized mrnas of these mutants are candidates for translational repression in non-activated gametocytes  <cit> . a total of  <dig> genes  were identified as candidates regulated by dozi and cith ; eight of those lack any gametocyte protein evidence. one of the destabilized genes was identified as a single peptide hit while the remaining two destabilized genes had  <dig> and  <dig> peptide hits in total. a number of  <dig> additional genes were destabilized in the combined dozi and cith datasets indicating they could also be under translational control . the data comparison indicates that the majority of genes identified via ssh, which change in transcript expression levels during gametocyte activation, are not translationally controlled in non-activated gametocytes, while many such genes have been identified to function in zygote to ookinete transformation  <cit> . in conclusion, gene regulation appears to be important for the early events of gametocyte activation, i.e. for gametogenesis and fertilization, while translational repression particularly plays a role for the expression of proteins important for ookinete development.

we used real-time rt-pcr analyses to confirm the transcript changes in gametocytes during activation for a subset of the identified genes and to determine, if these genes become up- or down-regulated in their expression during gametocyte activation. total rna was isolated from immature  and mature  gametocytes of p. falciparum strain nf <dig> and from activated gametocytes at  <dig> min post-activation . furthermore, we isolated rna from mixed asexual blood stages of the gametocyte-less p. falciparum strain f <dig>  initially, the synthesized cdna of each sample was tested for its stage-specificity by diagnostic rt-pcr, using primers for the asexual blood stage gene ama- <dig> <cit>  and for the gametocyte-specific gene pfccp <dig> <cit> . the tests confirmed that no pfccp <dig> transcript was present in the f <dig> sample, while no ama- <dig> expression was detected in the purified gametocyte samples of strain nf <dig> . the absence of ama- <dig> signals in the gametocyte samples and the absence of pfccp <dig> in the f <dig> asexual blood stage sample further showed that these were devoid of any contamination by genomic dna . an additional test for gdna contamination was performed by using primers specific for the gene hdac <dig> . in all parasite samples, i.e. in samples of f <dig> asexual blood stages as well as in nf <dig> immature, mature and activated gametocytes, hdac <dig> transcript was present , as shown by diagnostic rt-pcr. in sample preparations lacking reverse transcriptase, on the other hand, no hdac1-specific pcr bands were detected.

we chose  <dig> genes from the ssh analysis for comparison of transcript abundance, with representatives from all ontology groups. the gene pfs <dig> was selected as an internal control, because it is known to be highly expressed in gametocytes throughout development, while it is absent in the gametes  <cit> . furthermore two sexual stage-specific genes, actin ii and pfs <dig>  served as external controls. pfs <dig> is expressed in vesicular structures during gametocyte maturation and relocates to the surface of macrogametes following activation. pfs <dig> is subsequently present on the parasite surface until the ookinete stage  <cit> . actin ii is a sexual stage-specific actin isomer, and in p. berghei actin ii was reported to play a role during microgametogenesis  <cit> . in addition, the gene su Î± <dig>  encoding for subunit  Î± <dig> of the Î±-ring of the proteasome core particle  <cit> , was included in the investigations.

transcript expression levels were measured via real-time rt-pcr and calculated by the 2-Î”ct method  <cit>  in which the threshold cycle number , was normalized to the ct of the endogenous control gene encoding for p. falciparum seryl trna synthetase  as reference gene  <cit> . transcript levels with 2-Î”ct values below  <dig>  were considered negligible. real-time rt-pcr revealed transcription in mature gametocytes for  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes. out of these,  <dig> genes showed increased transcript expression in gametocytes compared to asexual blood stage parasites .

seven genes were identified, i.e. pf3d7_ <dig> , pf3d7_ <dig> , pf3d7_ <dig> , pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig>  and pf3d7_ <dig>  for which transcript levels were increased in activated gametocytes as compared to asexual blood stages, immature gametocytes and non-activated gametocytes , indicating that these genes may play an important role downstream of gametocyte activation in the mosquito midgut. set <dig> was previously described to accumulate in male gametocytes, where it contributes to a prompt entry and execution of s/m phases during microgametogenesis  <cit> . set domains are assigned to chromatin dynamics and are often found in histone methyltransferases, thus they play a role in the epigenetic control of gene regulation. the p. falciparum genome encodes for at least nine set-domain-containing proteins which exhibit five different types of substrate specificities  <cit> .

actin i was described as part of the plasmodial motor complex  and was recently also reported to be present in gametocytes  <cit> . furthermore, psop <dig>  was previously reported to be expressed in mature gametocytes of p. falciparum <cit>  and in ookinetes of p. berghei <cit> . in addition, transcript expression of the two control genes, pf3d7_ <dig>  and pf3d7_ <dig>  was strong in gametocytes compared to asexual blood stage parasites and increased during gametocyte activation .

eight genes had an increased transcript expression in gametocytes compared to asexual blood stage parasites, and transcript levels either remained constant or decreased following activation. these include pf3d7_ <dig> , pf3d7_ <dig> , pf3d7_ <dig> , pf3d7_ <dig> , pf3d7_ <dig> , pf3d7_ <dig> , pf3d7_ <dig>  and pf3d7_ <dig> . the mrna splicing kinase clk <dig>  is expressed in the asexual blood stages and gametocytes of p. falciparum <cit>  and a gene knock-out of the orthologous protein in p. berghei failed to exflagellate upon gametocyte activation  <cit> . the gene set <dig> encodes for one of the nine set-domain-containing proteins . transcript of set <dig> is destabilized in the absence of dozi and cith , pointing at a translational repression of set <dig> in gametocytes and a role in epigenetic control mechanisms of the ookinete.

pfs <dig> is a transmembrane protein of the gametocyte pvm  <cit> . after the pvm has ruptured during the egress of the activated gametocyte from the host cell, pfs <dig> is not detectable any longer in the sexual stage parasites  <cit>  , explaining the decrease of transcript following activation. furthermore, Î±-tubulin ii represents a tubulin isoform that is expressed in asexual blood stage parasites, in gametocytes and in microgametes  <cit> . targeted gene modification studies in p. berghei indicated that Î±-tubulin ii plays an important role for microgametogenesis  <cit> . the fact that Î±-tubulin ii transcript levels decrease during gametogenesis lets us conclude that the Î±-tubulin ii filaments needed for the formation of the microgametes are already present in the mature gametocytes prior to activation.

the presenilin-like signal peptide peptidase  was previously reported to be involved in merozoite invasion and cleavage of the erythrocyte cytoskeletal protein band  <dig>  <cit> . a recent study, however, disagreed with these findings, and reported that spp is an er-resident protease required for growth of the erythrocytic stages  <cit> . spp is considered a potential drug target of liver and blood stage parasites  <cit> . the combined data indicate that spp is present in the liver, blood and gametocyte stages, pointing to a role of spp in multiple life-cycle stages of plasmodium.

the gene product of pf3d7_ <dig> comprises a mac/pf domain, similar to the mac/pf domains of the previously described plasmodial perforin-like proteins pplp1- <dig>  <cit>  . we therefore termed the protein pplp <dig> in this study. furthermore, the gene product of pf3d7_ <dig> is a member of a family of nine secreted proteins with cysteine-rich cpw-wpc domains  <cit>  . the cpw-wpc domain is a conserved domain of about  <dig> residues in length that exhibits six well-conserved cysteine residues and six well-conserved aromatic sites. the functions and life cycle expression patterns of the plasmodial cpw-wpc proteins are hitherto not known.

three genes were predominantly expressed in the asexual blood stages and show a resurgence in transcript expression in gametocytes during maturation, i.e. pf3d7_ <dig> , pf3d7_ <dig> , and pf3d7_ <dig>  the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase pk <dig> was hitherto only investigated in the asexual blood stages of p. falciparum <cit>  and protein expression in gametocytes has not yet been investigated. the gene product of pf3d7_ <dig> comprises a tpr domain, which is known to mediate protein-protein interactions and the assembly of multiprotein complexes , but the function of the plasmodial tpr domain protein is not yet known. while transcript levels of pf3d7_ <dig> increase during gametocyte development, a drop following activation was observed.

for four genes, pf3d7_ <dig> , pf3d7_ <dig> , pf3d7_ <dig> , and pf3d7_ <dig>  expression was high in asexual blood stages and decreased during gametocyte development and following activation . su Î± <dig> is a component of the plasmodial proteasome, a proteolytic complex composed of more than  <dig> sus that is responsible for the degradation and recycling of ubiquitinated proteins. as an external control we thus investigated the transcript levels of another Î±-ring component, su Î± <dig>  and revealed similar changes in the transcript levels of su Î± <dig> in asexual blood stage parasites and gametocytes before and after activation .

the genome of p. falciparum encodes for a variety of chaperones, including heat shock proteins  of the hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and dnaj/hsp <dig> families . hsp70- <dig> was previously described to be located in the cytoplasm and nucleus of the parasite blood stages  <cit>  as well as in the pv, pointing to a role in protein transport to the erythrocyte  <cit> . another proposed function of hsp70- <dig> includes the protein trafficking to the apicoplast  <cit> , indicating that the chaperone has several essential functions and is important for multiple life-cycle stages. it remains to be elucidated, if other of the identified hsps have more specific functions during parasite transmission from human to mosquito. interestingly in this context, hsp <dig> belongs to a family of evolutionarily conserved chaperones which has been suggested as a capacitor for morphological evolution because reduction of its function results in phenotypic variation in drosophila <cit> . in addition, hsp <dig> displays multiple roles in stress adaptation and development, including spermatogenesis, oogenesis and embryogenesis in insects  <cit> .

the transmembrane protein gap <dig> is part of the imc of the parasite invasive stages, including the ookinete  <cit> . here, it links myosin with the outer membrane of the imc and thus contributes to gliding motility of the parasite. recently, gap <dig> was also described as a component of the gametocyte imc  <cit> , which appears to be important for the stability of the crescent-shaped cell. noteworthy, transcript of the p. berghei orthologous protein was shown to co-precipitate with dozi and cith , indicating that gap <dig> is translationally repressed in gametocytes. thus, the release of the translational repression and onset of protein synthesis during gametocyte activation might cause the detected decrease in the gap <dig> transcript level.

fbpa is an enzyme of glycolysis, and in plasmodium is also reported to be part of the motor complex, here linking trap to actin i  <cit> . noteworthy in this context, during gametocytogenesis, malaria parasites shift from glycolysis towards mitochondrial respiration  <cit> , which might explain the decrease in fbpa expression in gametocytes compared to asexual blood stage parasites.

transcript expression for five genes, pf3d7_ <dig> , pf3d7_ <dig> , pf3d7_ <dig> , pf3d7_ <dig> , and pf3d7_ <dig> , is negligible in gametocytes. the gene pf3d7_ <dig> encodes for a homolog to the yeast vacuolar sorting protein vsp <dig> with a predicted function in protein-protein interactions, while pf3d7_ <dig> encodes for a protein with a wd <dig> motif. wd-repeat proteins are a large family found in all eukaryotes, implicated in a variety of functions ranging from signal transduction and transcription regulation to cell cycle control and apoptosis. the wd <dig> motifs act as a site for protein-protein interaction, and proteins containing wd <dig> repeats are known to serve as platforms for the assembly of protein complexes or mediators of transient interplay among other proteins . wd-repeat proteins of p. falciparum have hitherto been described as receptors for protein kinase c, and as components of the myosin-driven motor complex  <cit> . furthermore, alv <dig> is a member of the alveolin family, which comprises seven proteins in p. falciparum, associated with the membranous sacs of the imc  <cit> . the fact that alv <dig> expression decreases during gametocytogenesis is fairly surprising, considering that gametocytes possess an imc . it has to be elucidated, if the expression of any other alveolin is up-regulated in gametocytes.

the early transcribed membrane proteins  are proteins of the plasmodial pvm  <cit> . in p. falciparum the proteins were shown to form complexes with the pvm protein exported protein  <dig>   <cit> . to date, etramp <dig>  transcripts were found in p. falciparum trophozoites and the mixed asexual stages and the liver stages of p. yoelii <cit> . because exp- <dig> is also present in the gametocyte pvm  <cit> , the expression of some of the etramps in these stages can be expected. it thus remains to be elucidated, if the other two ssh-identified etramps, etramp <dig> and etramp <dig>  might play a specific role for gametocytes. expression of serine repeat antigen sera <dig> in the asexual blood stages has previously been described  <cit> . the sera family comprises nine proteins with functions in asexual blood stage growth and host cell egress .

for selected genes we subsequently investigated the expression changes on the protein level. antibodies against the proteins pk <dig>  clk- <dig>  actin i and actin ii, gap <dig>  proteasome su Î± <dig>  pfs <dig>  pfs <dig> and pplp <dig> were used to immunolabel the respective proteins in samples of p. falciparum f <dig> asexual blood stages, non-activated nf <dig> gametocytes and gametocytes at  <dig> min p.a. via indirect immunofluorescence assay . asexual blood stage parasites were highlighted by msp- <dig> labeling; gametocytes were highlighted by labeling of pfs <dig> or pfs <dig>  respectively. the abundance of the respective proteins in gametocytes before and after activation was quantified by measuring the average fluorescence signal intensity of a total number of  <dig> plotted cells per setting . a significant up-regulation in the expression of pk <dig>  actin ii and pfs <dig> following gametocyte activation was confirmed . while pk <dig> is also expressed in asexual blood stage parasites, actin ii and pfs <dig> cannot be detected in these stages. on the other hand, clk <dig>  proteasome su Î± <dig>  and pplp <dig> were detected in asexual blood stage parasites and gametocytes during maturation, but the proteins were down-regulated in gametocytes at  <dig> min p.a. . while labeling of clk <dig> and su Î± <dig> revealed a homogenous expression of these proteins in the parasite cytoplasm and nucleus, pplp6-labeling exhibited a punctuated expression . noteworthy, the pplp <dig> labeling disappeared after the gametes have fully egressed from the enveloping erythrocyte. a role of the perforin pplp <dig> was assigned to rupturing the pvm during host cell egress by the apicomplexan parasite toxoplasma gondii <cit> , and a recent study reported the involvement of pplp <dig> in the lysis of the erythrocyte membrane during the exflagellation of male p. berghei gametocytes  <cit> . we thus hypothesize that the plasmodial pplp <dig> might also play a role in the rupture of the enveloping membranes of the activated gametocytes, explaining its disappearance during gametogenesis. similarly, the pvm-based protein pfs <dig> was not present in gametocytes at  <dig> min p.a., since at this time point the parasites have egressed from the enveloping erythrocyte and the pvm was destroyed  <cit> . furthermore, in agreement with the real-time rt-pcr results, actin i is present in both, asexual blood stages and gametocytes, and a minor up-regulation in the activated gametocytes was detected .

interestingly, we demonstrated a slight up-regulation in the protein expression of gap <dig> at  <dig> min p.a., although a decrease in transcript levels was described during this process. this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that translationally repressed gap <dig> transcript is present in the non-activated gametocytes , and that the release of repression during activation leads to rapid translation and in consequence to a loss in transcript abundance and an increase in protein abundance. it is worth mentioning in this context, that we recently showed a relocation of gap <dig> from the gametocyte imc to the plasma membrane during gametogenesis. once on the gamete surface, gap <dig> binds the human complement regulator protein factor h from the blood meal, which enables the extracellular parasite to prevent lysis by the human complement  <cit> .

in summary we demonstrate that the majority of genes, which are regulated in their expression levels during gametocyte activation, have functions assigned to signaling, cell cycle and gene regulation, and proteostasis, or that they are cytoskeletal or cell surface proteins. the regulated expression of proteins involved in signaling and cell cycle control is on the one hand important for the signaling pathways that result in the induction of gametogenesis, once temperature drop and xa are perceived by the parasite  <cit>  . the molecular changes in the composition of cytoskeletal and surface proteins are important for stage conversion during gametogenesis and for adaptation of the parasite to the insect host and also promote the development of the parasite midgut stages, like the ookinete. the changes in protein expression during parasite transmission from human to insect further explain the importance of chaperones and assembly proteins. the proteasome on the other hand appears to play only a minor role during gametogenesis. we hypothesize that proteins which lost their function, once the parasite has entered the mosquito vector, are only degraded after the gametes have developed and after fertilization has occurred, thus after the phase of rapid stage conversions has finished.

noteworthy, the ssh analysis identified a number of unknown proteins with transmembrane domains and/or signal peptides, and for six of them, high transcript levels were shown in mature and activated gametocytes. for three of the genes, expression in the gametocytes was higher as compared to asexual blood stage parasites, and these genes might encode for proteins important for gametocyte development or gametogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
the here presented data on the changes in the p. falciparum transcriptome during gametogenesis provide first insights into the regulated gene expression occurring while the malaria parasite passes the initial phase of transmission to the mosquito. our findings form the basis for further studies on genes important for malaria transmission and support the identification of proteins involved in the development of the mosquito midgut stages, which might lead to the discovery of new transmission blocking targets.
