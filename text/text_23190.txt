BACKGROUND
hydroxycholesterols are mono-oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol  that comprise a family of polycyclic compounds that contain a second oxygen atom as a hydroxyl group on the skeleton of cholesterol. in vivo, hydroxycholesterols are present as unesterified  and esterified forms   <cit>  hydroxycholesterols are formed through enzymatic conversion of cholesterol or by free radical autoxidation, and exhibit a short half life relative to cholesterol. hydroxycholesterols are important intermediates in a number of catabolic pathways that regulate a variety of biological effects. for example, hydroxycholesterols are important for cholesterol transport from the periphery to the liver  <cit> , modulate the expression of sterol sensitive genes involved in lipid and sterol biosynthesis  <cit> , act as substrates for the formation of bile salts  <cit> , serve as ligands that activate nuclear liver x receptors-α and -β  <cit> , and are involved in the regulation of cholesterol and lipid metabolism and homeostasis  <cit> . in the central nervous system, hydroxycholesterols regulate arachidonic acid release, voltage-gated calcium channels, synaptic plasticity, induce il- <dig>  promote neurogenesis and induce apoptosis  <cit> . consistent with these important roles for regulating biological functions, levels of free hydroxycholesterols are extremely low and tightly controlled, with the majority of hydroxycholesterols maintained in esterified forms  <cit> .

many cell types have the ability to oxygenate cholesterol by mechanisms that involve the cytochrome p <dig> family of oxidases . cell type specific expression cyp subtypes results in the tissue-specific production of particular oxysterol species. several cyp are present in the central nervous system including 24s-hydroxycholesterolhydroxylase , a p <dig> family member that is expressed in neurons, glia and in endothelial cells of the blood–brain barrier  <cit> . 24s-hydroxycholesterol -diol) is the most abundant hydroxycholesterol in brain and is the primary transport form of cholesterol from the central nervous system into the blood, with smaller amounts eliminated through cerebrospinal fluid  <cit> . it has been suggested by several studies that serum or plasma levels of 24s-hydroxycholesterol may reflect brain developmental and neuropathological changes associated with alzheimer’s disease , huntington’s disease and multiple sclerosis  <cit> . 24s-hydroxycholesterol is often expressed as a ratio to 27-hydroxycholesterol . 27-hydroxycholesterol is formed primarily in the periphery by the p <dig> enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase   <cit> . cyp <dig> is expressed in arterial endothelium, macrophages and to lesser extents in other tissues such as cortex, spleen, liver, kidney, adrenal gland and heart  <cit> . 27-hydroxycholesterol can function as a ligand for nuclear receptors, liver x receptors  and farnesoid x-activated receptors   <cit> . 27-hydroxycholesterol can also regulate hydrocymethylglutaryl-coa reductase  <cit> , and enhances cholesterol efflux from the vascular endothelium  <cit> . macrophages have the highest capacity to convert cholesterol to 27-hydroxycholesterol, which is then transported in blood to the liver where it is converted to bile acids  <cit> .

hydroxycholesterol detection and quantification has been accomplished in a variety of tissues by isotope-dilution gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry   <cit> , gas- and high-performance liquid chromatography /mass spectrometry  <cit> , hplc with uv detection of cholesterol oxidation products in tissues  <cit> , as ∆4- 3-ketone derivatives by hplc  <cit>  and as derivatives of gp hydrazones  <cit> . because “free” hydroxycholesterol levels are below the detection limits of many instruments, saponification and/or solid phase extraction techniques have typically been used to extract “total” hydroxycholesterols. the primary advantage of these methods is a high yield of hydroxycholesterols. the disadvantages include lengthy sample preparation times, sample loss, inconsistent yields, and the inability to discriminate between free and esterified hydroxycholesterols. in this study we developed a simple and direct extraction protocol and sensitive lc/esi/ms/ms method for separation and simultaneous quantitative determination of free 24s-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol in serum.

RESULTS

the structures of cholesterol, 24s-hydroxycholesterol, 27-hydroxycholesterol and 24-hydroxycholesterol  are shown in figure  <dig>  hydroxycholesterols were identified -as ammonium adducts of 24s-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol or 24-hydroxycholesterol   using esi/ms operated in the positive ion mode. molecules of 24s-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol were detected as ammonium adducts  with a molecular weight of  <dig>  m/z . the collision induced dissociation of individual hydroxycholesterol species were then characterized by product ion scanning using the highest abundance product ions with adequate signal/noise ratios. for 24s-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol the molecular fragment identified was  <dig>  m/z . for  <dig>  hydroxycholesterol  the molecular ion identified was  <dig>  m/z and the highly abundant product was  <dig>  m/z . we optimized the following mass spectrometer parameters that were then used for all hydroxycholesterol species: ion spray voltage  2500 ev, temperature  250°c, nebulizer gas  13 psi, curtain gas  8 psi, collision activated dissociation  12 psi, dwell time  150 msec, and entrance potential  10 ev. the declustering potential , focusing potential , collision energy , collision exit potential , orientation of the electrospray needle and auxiliary gas flow were individually optimized for each analyte by both direct infusion and flow thorough infusion  to maximize accuracy and sensitivity . we developed our method with two fragmented ions of  <dig>  hydroxycholesterol  , and ultimately chose to use  <dig> / <dig> , as this transition displayed a high signal/noise ratio, a stable low baseline, was abundant, and stable compared to the  <dig> / <dig>  transition, which showed an unstable baseline .figure  <dig>

linearity, limits of detection and quantification
defined amounts of both 24s-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol standards  were added to control serum samples prior to extraction. standard curves were plotted as the ratio of the peak areas for 24s-hydroxycholesterol or 27-hydroxycholesterol to the peak area of the internal standard 24-hydroxycholesterol . least-squares regression analysis for 24s-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol standard curves demonstrated linearity in the range of  <dig> – 1000 ng/ml with a correlation coefficient of r <dig> for 24s-hydroxycholesterol  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for 27-hydroxycholesterol . the limit of detection was calculated using the signal to noise ratio. the lower detection limits for 24s-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol were nearly identical at  <dig> fmoles on the column. we then calculated the concentration of free 24-hydroxycholeserol and 27-hydroxycholesterol in our human serum samples. the average serum concentrations were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml for 24-hydroxycholesterol and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml for 27-hydroxycholesterol .table  <dig>

discussion
the goal of this study was to develop an efficient and rapid extraction protocol for lc/esi/ms/ms-based detection and quantification of free 24s-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol from human serum. for clinical studies, and for the potential use of these hydroxysterols as surrogate markers, it is important that sample analysis be rapid and cost effective. here we present a simple, inexpensive, and rapid protocol for the extraction of 24s-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol from human serum. in addition, the simplicity of the extraction method increases data reproducibility by decreasing variability of product yield. this low cost and rapid sample preparation coupled with the high sensitivity of lc/ms/ms instruments and accurate quantification by mrm make this a potentially powerful approach for the high-throughput quantification of hydroxycholesterol species in clinical and experimental samples.

this extraction method does not use saponification and therefore measures free hydroxycholesterols. this is an important consideration since free hydroxycholesterols are the most biologically active form of these sterols  <cit> . in our healthy human volunteers, serum concentrations ranged from  <dig> to 21 ng/ml for 24s-hydroxycholesterol and  <dig> to 29 ng/ml for 27-hydroxycholesterol. these ranges are considerably lower than previously reported levels of total hydroxycholesterol in human serum that range from  <dig> to 83 ng/ml for 24s-hydroxycholesterol and  <dig> to 159 ng/ml for 27-hydroxycholesterol  <cit> . these data are consistent with findings that suggest more than 80% of 24s-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxychoelsterol are maintained in an esterfied state  <cit> .

since this is the first report of this extraction method, it is not possible to determine if measuring free hydroxycholesterols has a diagnostic or experimental advantage over measuring total hydroxycholesterols. in this study we analyzed a small number of samples to validate the method and did not compare to a disease state. however, we have recently used this method to quantitatively measure levels of free 24s-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol in serum of subjects who later developed cognitive impairment, and found that increased levels of free 24s-hydroxycholesterol and the 24s-hydroxycholesterol/total cholesterol ratio were associated with greater risk of impairment on tasks that assess psychomotor speed and executive functioning, while higher levels of free 27-hydroxycholesterol and the 27-hydroxycholesterol/total cholesterol ratio were associated with greater risk of delayed memory impairment. these data were qualitatively different from previous reports that measured total serum levels of these hydroxysterols. for example, total 27-hydroxycholesterol to total cholesterol ratio was associated with a faster decline of immediate memory recall over six years of follow-up  <cit> . although, a second reported study did not find an association between total serum 24-hydroxycholesterol or total 27-hydroxycholesterol and cognitive performance  <cit> , this study measured total hydroxysterols. to date, only a single study has directly compared free to total levels of 24s-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol in serum. in this study it was reported that 80% of 24s-hydroxycholesterol and 85% of 27-hydroxycholesterol is esterfied in healthy volunteers. males had higher levels of total 27-hydroxycholesterol compared to females. they found no other demographic or age-related differences in total 24s-hydroxycholesterol or 27-hydroxychoelsterol, and did not determine if there were age- or disease-related differences in free vs. esterfied hydroxycholesterols. since it is the free forms of these hydroxysterols that have biological activity, and free forms are less than 20% of total hydroxysterols, it is possible that measuring total 24s-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol could mask a biological or disease-associated effect. these findings suggest that there may be important differences in free vs. total 24s-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterols in relation to sex, age and neurodegenerative conditions that merit further study.

the ability to economically and efficiently measure 24s-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol in serum may also be useful as surrogate measures for the effectiveness of chemotherapeutics. the approximate cost per sample for this rapid extraction method is $ <dig> . saponification with solid phase extraction increases the approximate cost $ <dig> /sample. these costs are for sample processing and do no include mass spectrometry time that is equal for both methods. likewise sample run times are 12 min/sample regardless of the extraction method. a number of sterol modifying agents are being tested as potential therapeutics for neurodegenerative disease  <cit> , and it is possible that serum measures of 24s-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol may have utility as rapid and inexpensive surrogate markers to efficiently determine the effectiveness of therapeutics.

CONCLUSIONS
serum measurements of these biologically active hydroxycholesterols may be useful surrogate measures for brain health in a variety of neurodegenerative conditions.
