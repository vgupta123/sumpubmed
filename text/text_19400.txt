BACKGROUND
the enzyme telomerase, comprising a telomerase reverse transcriptase  subunit and a rna subunit , is ubiquitous from unicellular protozoa to mammals  <cit> . in humans, transcriptional regulation of htert is the major mechanism of telomerase activation. hypoxia responsive elements , to which the hypoxia-inducible factor  <dig>  binds to regulate transcription of hif-responsive genes, have been detected in the htert promoter  <cit> . current understanding on the mechanistic relationship between hypoxia, hypoxia-inducible factor- <dig>  and htert gene expression is largely based on in vitro studies in human cancer cells. for instance, hif- <dig> has been shown to transactivate htert expression in human choriocarcinoma cells  <cit> , cervical cancer cells  <cit>  and ovarian carcinoma cells  <cit> . hypoxia induction of htert expression and subsequent telomerase activity have been reported for solid tumor cells   <cit> . the hif-1α protein has been shown to correlate well with htert expression in human placentas  <cit> . conversely, koshiji et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that hif-1α downregulates htert expression in human colon cancer cells, presumably via the displacement of myc binding from the htert promoter. these conflicting findings suggest multiple mechanistic relationships between hypoxia, hif-1α and htert expression in human cancer cells. yet, it remains virtually unknown whether these findings can be directly extrapolated to non-tumor tissues in other whole animal systems in vivo.

fish often encounter hypoxia in the aquatic environment, which is a pressing environmental problem worldwide  <cit> . gracey et al.  <cit>  used cdna microarrays to study the hypoxia-induced gene expression profiles of the euryoxic fish, gillichthys mirabilis, and found that genes encoding glycolytic enzymes and those involved in protein synthesis are downregulated, which support the notion that metabolic depression is an important strategy for survival under hypoxia  <cit> . interestingly, induction of genes involved in the suppression of cell proliferation and growth has also been observed which could serve as bioindicators of lowered growth during hypoxia. for example, insulin-like growth factor binding protein- <dig>  which regulates the availability of insulin-like growth factors in the circulation is involved in growth regulation. the role of hif- <dig> in modulation of the igfbp- <dig> gene and its involvement in hypoxia-induced growth and developmental retardation have recently been reported in zebrafish  <cit> . although a detailed pattern of response to hypoxia in fish is emerging, it is not clear at what level of hypoxia these responses are initiated and how the various responses are related to each other. so far, we know of no reports on the effect of hif- <dig> on tert transcription in any piscine system. given the important roles that tert plays in apoptosis, dna repair, cell proliferation and growth  <cit> , a better understanding of the relationship between hypoxia and fish tert expression will shed light on the in vivo regulation of fish tert and its role in adaptive and toxicological responses in fish to hypoxic stress.

to investigate hypoxic regulation of fish tert expression in vivo, we isolated and cloned the tert gene  from the marine medaka, oryzias melastigma, and examined its in vivo organ expression patterns in whole fish under normoxia and in response to hypoxic stress. analysis of omtert expression by quantitative rt-pcr and in situ hybridization showed significant in vivo induction of omtert expression in fish livers and testes. gene transactivation studies using luciferase reporter constructs showed that ectopic expression of omhif-1α enhanced omtert promoter activity in vitro. taken together, our findings support the notion that hypoxia upregulates omtert expression via omhif- <dig> in non-tumor fish tissues in vivo.

RESULTS
isolation and characterization of the omtert cdna
using degenerate rt-pcr and race, the full-length omtert cdna was isolated from o. melastigma. the nucleotide sequence has been deposited in genbank under accession number dq <dig>  the 3624-bp full-length cdna contains an open reading frame  of  <dig> bp, a 5'-untranslated region  of  <dig> bp, a 3'-utr of  <dig> bp and a polyadenylated tail of  <dig> bp. a putative polyadenylation signal  is located  <dig> bp downstream of the stop codon  . the open reading frame  of omtert encodes a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids, with a molecular weight  of  <dig>  kda and a pi of  <dig> . the physical properties of omtert are very similar to that of the fugu tert . pairwise alignment showed that omtert shares high sequence identity with the terts of orange-spotted grouper  and fugu  and moderate sequence identity with the terts of mouse , human , frog  and chicken .

multiple sequence alignment indicated that omtert contains all of the functional motifs that are highly conserved in terts from other vertebrate species . moreover, sequence comparison of homologus domains from different terts indicated that motifs c  and e  are most highly conserved . these two motifs in omtert contain signature residues that distinguish telomerase rt from other rts – the aromatic residue following the two aspartic acid residues in motif c and the tryptophan-x-glycine-x-serine/leucine residues in motif e . these signature sequences along with the tert-specific t motif indicate that omtert is a vertebrate tert. additionally, conserved amino acid residues known to be indispensable for telomerase activity  <cit>  are also found in motifs gq,  <dig>   <dig>  b', c and e in omtert . interestingly, the telomerase activity-determining aspartic acid in motif a of non-teleost terts is replaced by glutamic acid in all the fish terts. while negligible homology is present among the non-functional flexible linker region  in the terts examined, the length of this linker region in fish terts  are considerably shorter than those of other vertebrate terts .

in vivo expression and response pattern of omtert to hypoxia
real-time pcr revealed ubiquitous expression of omtert mrna in all of the  <dig> organs examined in both male and female adult fish , where highest expression was observed in the fish gonads. moderate omtert expression was detected in gill, brain, kidney, gut and spleen followed by eye, heart, skin, muscle. omtert was expressed only very weakly in liver.

we next compared the expression of omtert mrna under normoxia and hypoxia in two fish organs showing the highest  and lowest  endogenous omtert expression levels. since a large variation in omtert expression was found among different fish ovary samples, testes instead of ovaries were used. upon exposure to hypoxia for  <dig> h and  <dig> h, no significant difference in expression of omtert , omhif-1α  and the hif-regulated omepo gene  was observed when compared to normoxic fish testes. upon exposure to prolonged hypoxia for  <dig> h, omtert in testes was induced by  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fold  with a concomitant increase in omhif-1α  and omepo  expression. in liver, omtert was hypoxically induced as early as  <dig> h  and the level was sustained until  <dig> h . at these two time points, hypoxic induction of omhif-1α ; and  <dig> h:  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fold ; fig. 3b) and omepo ; and  <dig> h:  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fold ; fig. 3c) was also observed in the liver.

in situ hybridization analysis showed that under normoxia, omtert mrna was only weakly expressed in the liver parenchyma . at  <dig> h hypoxia, omtert expression was induced significantly in the caudal region of liver . in testis, omtert expression was localized mainly in cysts containing highly proliferative sperm cells  and differentiating spermatids but not in mature spermatozoa . upon exposure to hypoxia for  <dig> h, cysts containing spermatogonia showed the strongest induction of omtert expression .

omtert 5'-flanking sequence
pcr amplification of a stui genome walking library  yielded a  <dig> -kb genomic fragment which contains 3440-bp of 5'-flanking sequence and 185-bp 5'-utr of the omtert gene. the sequence has been deposited in genbank under accession number dq <dig>  similar to the tert promoters of fugu, chicken and human  <cit> , the omtert 5'-flanking sequence lacks a canonical tata box but contains three putative ccaat boxes near the transcription start site . in contrast to htert and ctert, no cpg island is found in the omtert promoter, which is notably at-rich . comparison of the omtert and ftert 5'-flanking sequences using the promoterwise program   <cit>  failed to detect any homologous region of significant sequence identity. using blast, the o. latipes tert  promoter sequence was identified in the medaka genome database  <cit>  , and a 177-bp region that is conserved in both the omtert and the o. latipes tert  promoters  upstream of the tss was identified. significant sequence homology  was also identified in the 5'-utrs of the omtert and oltert genes.

to identify potential transcription factor binding sites  in the omtert promoter, the first 1000-bp sequence upstream of the tss was analyzed using a filter string-based search supported by the tess program  <cit> . two putative hres  were identified which contain the exact hre sequence  as the functional hre described in the zfigfbp- <dig> gene promoter of zebrafish  <cit> . however, a hif- <dig> ancillary sequence  adjacent to the hre, that affects hypoxia and hif- <dig> responsiveness of the zfigfbp- <dig> gene, is not present in the omtert promoter. moreover, a single putative hre core  was also identified in the fugu tert promoter .

other putative tfbss of particular interest were also found: ap <dig> , sp <dig> , nf- <dig> , e-box , gata- <dig> , gata- <dig> , gata- <dig> , usf , c-myb , gr , pr , ar , t3r-β , er  and c-est- <dig>  and dre . of these putative tfbss: ap <dig>  sp <dig>  usf, e-box, and er are implicated in the regulation of htert transcription  <cit> .

induction of omtert promoter by omhif-1α
to test the hypothesis that hif-1α regulates omtert transcription, the effect of omhif-1α overexpression on luciferase activity driven by  <dig> kb of omtert promoter sequence was evaluated in hif-1α-deficient cho ka <dig> cells. when cells were co-transfected with both pcmv-omhif-1α and ptert-luc, luciferase activity was significantly increased by ca. 2-fold when compared with cells transfected with ptert-luc alone  .

discussion
the marine medaka, o. melastigma, is a hypoxia-tolerant species and can survive in a hypoxic environment  for 1– <dig> weeks with < <dig> % mortality . the hypoxia tolerance of o. melastigma was found to be comparable to that of other hypoxia-tolerant fish species such as the mudsucker, gillichthys mirabilis  <cit>  and the common carp, cyprinus carpio  <cit> . in this study, we have cloned and characterized the expression pattern of the full-length telomerase reverse transcriptase  cdna from the marine medaka, o. melastigma. the deduced omtert protein contains all of the functional motifs that are conserved in other vertebrate terts , and shares particularly high sequence identity with the tert of fugu  and moderate sequence identity  with terts from other vertebrate species. among the different motifs in tert, motif e is the most highly conserved showing  <dig> –100% overall identity among the fish terts and  <dig> % overall identity among vertebrates . banik et al.  <cit>  showed that the sequence spanning motif e to motif e-i is required for telomerase activity and curiously, analysis of the dna sequences of the fish terts in this study showed that the lengths of motifs  <dig> and  <dig>  are shorter by  <dig> and 8– <dig> residues, respectively, than other vertebrate terts. however, it is unclear what effect these changes may have on the rt activity of tert. overall, the findings of this study indicate that the structure and regulation of tert is highly conserved in vertebrates from fish to human.

real-time pcr analysis showed that omtert is expressed ubiquitously, albeit at varying levels, in different organs of the adult marine medaka . in particular, major expression of omtert was detected in ovary and testis where germ cells are actively dividing and differentiating. in situ hybridization analysis of testes demonstrated that high omtert expression is restricted to highly proliferating sperm cells  and differentiating spermatids but not in mature spermatozoa . this is in agreement with the findings of achi et al.  <cit> , which indicated a progressive decline in telomerase activity in the rat testes during sperm cell development. in this context, it was not surprising that omtert was also found to be highly expressed in regenerative tissues such as gill, gut and kidney. a similarly high level of omtert expression that was observed in the medaka brain  may be attributed to the presence of undifferentiated neuronal precursor cells as was demonstrated in the xenopus brain  <cit> . recent evidence indicate that tert expression in the brain enhances cell survival of developing neurons  <cit> . in this study, a low level of omtert expression was also detected in liver and muscle tissues of the marine medaka. this is in agreement with the presence of telomerase activity in the muscle and liver tissues of adult zebrafish  <cit> , rainbow trout  <cit>  and marine medaka .

marine medaka exposed to prolonged hypoxia showed significant induction of omtert expression in the testis  and liver , as determined by both quantitative rt-pcr and in situ hybridization techniques, that positively correlated with elevated expression levels of the omhif-1α and omepo genes . because of the unavailability of omhif-1α-specific antibodies, detection of omhif-1α protein by either western blotting or immunohistochemistry was not possible, and expression of omhif-1α and the hif-1-regulated omepo gene was therefore used as an indicator of hypoxic induction of omhif- <dig> in this study. to determine whether omtert is responsive to the hif transcription factor, two putative hre core sequences  were identified in the omtert promoter by computer analysis , and gene transfection experiments in cho cells indicated that the omtert promoter is upregulated by omhif-1α . the results strongly suggest that omhif-1α has a role in the regulation of omtert expression. and based on the molecular responses of omtert to hypoxia in the medaka liver and testis , it is highly likely that upregulated expression of omtert under hypoxia is mediated  via omhif- <dig> in whole fish in vivo. the mechanistic relationships between omhif-1α and omtert , and the associated changes in omtert telomerase activity in various fish organs under normoxia and hypoxia  are currently being investigated in our laboratory to better understand the role of these molecules in cell proliferation and growth.

the differential responses of hepatocytes  and testicular cells  in the marine medaka to hypoxic stress indicate that hypoxic induction of tert is cell-type specific. anti-apoptotic and protective functions of tert against hypoxia-induced apoptosis and dna damage have been demonstrated in a variety of mammalian cells . it is tempting therefore to speculate that the increase in omtert expression in medaka liver and testis under hypoxia could be a protective response to enhance survival of specific cell types. for instance, the role of tert in maintaining the genomic stability of male germ cells is particularly critical during spermatogenesis to ensure the transfer of intact chromosomes to the offspring  <cit> . additionally, the presence of a putative e-box  and c-myb binding sites in the omtert promoter suggests that omtert activation may aid in promoting cell proliferation and differentiation  <cit>  by counteracting the potentially adverse effects of hypoxia on fish tissues. the molecular mechanisms operating through tert in regulating cellular homeostasis and gametogenesis in fish certainly warrant further investigation. functional studies and exposure experiments are currently underway in our laboratory to investigate the significance of the estrogen-  and dioxin-responsive  elements in the omtert promoter on in vivo gene expression in the marine medaka. conceivably, if omtert expression is responsive to challenges by various estrogenic and/or dioxin-related pollutants, and the responses could be linked to darwinian fitness traits  in the marine medaka, this will open the possibility of tert being used as a novel and meaningful molecular biomarker of effects for monitoring environmental stress and pollution in the marine environment  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we report here the isolation and characterization of the omtert gene from o. melastigma, a potential marine model fish for molecular ecotoxicology. our findings suggest that hypoxic induction of omtert expression in non-tumor liver and testis in whole fish system may be mediated, in part via the omhif- <dig> transcription factor. data from the marine medaka model suggest that the structure and regulation of tert gene is conserved in vertebrates from fish to human.
