BACKGROUND
the availability of a large variety of annotated and assembled vertebrate genome sequences has made it possible to address specific evolutionary questions on a genome-wide scale. this includes both large-scale analyses of genome evolution  <cit>  and targeted comparative evolutionary studies of specific gene families. the ensembl genome database  includes genomes for representatives of most vertebrate classes, as well as suitable out-groups for the study of vertebrate evolution  <cit> . the recent addition of the genomes of the comoran coelacanth latimeria chalumnae and the spotted gar lepisosteus oculatus complements the previous set of species with pivotal out-groups for tetrapods and teleost fishes, respectively. they are especially important for studies of genomic events that have taken place in either teleost or tetrapod evolution, as is the case for the chromosomal regions described in the present study.

the basal vertebrate whole genome duplications   <cit>  and subsequently the teleost-specific genome duplication   <cit>  have expanded numerous endocrine and neuronal gene families, see for example references  <cit> . here we have subjected the chromosomal regions harboring the somatostatin receptor family genes to a detailed analysis by collecting sequences from a broad range of vertebrate genomes, including several teleost fishes as well as the spotted gar and the coelacanth.

somatostatin, the short peptide responsible for inhibition of growth hormone release, was sequenced from sheep hypothalamus in  <dig>  <cit>  and its discovery was one of the achievements highlighted by the  <dig> nobel prize in physiology or medicine. subsequently this 14-amino-acid peptide was sequenced in numerous other vertebrate species and was found to be highly conserved during evolution. somatostatin is widely distributed and serves both as a neuroendocrine peptide regulating the pituitary, a neuropeptide acting on other neurons, and as an endocrine peptide. in accordance with this, somatostatin has been reported to have many physiological effects  <cit> . a somatostatin-related peptide was discovered in mouse and human and was named cortistatin or somatostatin- <dig>  <cit> . it is now known to be present throughout the tetrapods. in teleost fishes additional somatostatin-like peptides exist named somatostatin 3– <dig>  each encoded by a separate gene  <cit> . all of these duplicates may have arisen through chromosome duplications in 2r and 3r  <cit> .

after the first identification of binding sites for somatostatin, evidence began to accumulate for more than one receptor subtype. the cloning era of g-protein-coupled receptors led to the discovery of five somatostatin receptor subtypes in mammals, named sstr <dig> through  <dig> <cit> . the conserved structure of somatostatin receptor genes consists of a single exon encoding protein products of approximately  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids. the somatostatin receptors have been classified into two subfamilies based upon their degree of sequence identity: the human sstr <dig> and sstr <dig> amino acid sequences share 70% sequence identity in the region spanning tm <dig> to tm <dig> , while sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> share 56-66% amino acid sequence identity to each other. all five receptor subtypes inhibit adenylyl cyclases  <cit>  and they can also trigger other second messenger pathways to various extents.

homologs of the mammalian somatostatin receptors have been described in several teleost fishes, see nelson & sheridan  <cit>  for review. however, no sstr <dig> subtype has yet been described in a teleost fish. the known sstr repertoire in chicken is the same as in mammals and several of the receptors have been studied functionally  <cit> . it was proposed several years ago that the sstr family expanded in 2r  <cit>  although it was not clear how the appearance of the five members correlated with the two genome doublings. a more recent phylogenetic analysis  <cit>  presented a tree that was unresolved both with respect to species taxonomy and somatostatin receptor subtypes. other investigators have proposed that the sstrs arose from a series of duplications throughout vertebrate evolution  <cit> .

our analyses allow us to conclude that the chromosome duplications in early vertebrate evolution , and in the teleost tetraploidization , can explain the known repertoire of vertebrate somatostatin receptors. furthermore, we have discovered that one of the teleost receptors represents a sixth ancestral vertebrate subtype that we have called sstr <dig>  which is still present in some teleost fishes, the spotted gar and the coelacanth, but has been lost in tetrapods. thus, the somatostatin receptor system obtained its present complexity already in the early stages of vertebrate evolution. by centering our analyses around the sstr genes we could also disentangle complex rearrangements in the sstr-bearing chromosome regions in teleost fish genomes. this has implications for analyses of conserved synteny and the assignment of orthology for genes located in these regions.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analysis of the sstr gene family; identification of a sixth sstr subtype
somatostatin receptor amino acid sequences were collected from genome databases for several species representing most of the vertebrate classes: in addition to tetrapod and teleost fish genomes, the genomes of the comoran coelacanth  and the spotted gar  were investigated in order to provide relative dating points earlier in the evolution of lobe-finned fishes  and ray-finned fishes , respectively. the identified amino acid sequences include predictions from several previously unknown sstr sequences. these results are summarized in table  <dig>  and detailed descriptions of the identified sequences are included as supplemental note  <dig> .


a the anole lizard sstr <dig> sequence could not be identified in the most updated assembly , however it is located on genomic scaffold_ <dig> at  <dig>  kb in the previous assembly .

the sstr amino acid sequences identified in the genome databases were used to create an alignment for phylogenetic analyses in order to determine the identity of previously unknown sstr sequences and study the evolution of this gene family. using the human kisspeptin- <dig> receptor as out-group, the resulting phylogenetic maximum likelihood  tree in figure  <dig> shows that the vertebrate sstr family consists of six subtype clusters representing the five known sstr subtypes sstr <dig> through sstr <dig>  as well as a previously unrecognized sixth subtype. we have named these sequences sstr <dig> in our studies. in agreement with previous analyses of fewer sequences  <cit> , the tree has two well-defined ancestral branches; one including sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  and one containing the sstr <dig> and - <dig> as well as the sstr <dig> subtype. both branches are well-supported, and the separate sstr subtypes form well-supported clusters within each branch, using both bootstrapping and sh-like approximate likelihood ratio statistics . some subtypes are missing from some species’ genome databases . notably, sequences of the sixth subtype, sstr <dig>  could not be identified in any of the investigated tetrapod sequences, and sstr <dig> sequences could not be identified in teleost fishes or in the spotted gar. all six sstr subtypes are represented in the coelacanth, demonstrating that the absence of sstr <dig> genes in the spotted gar and teleost fishes, and of sstr <dig> genes in tetrapods likely resulted from secondary gene losses. in teleost fishes, an sstr <dig> sequence could only be identified in the zebrafish genome.


there are teleost specific duplicates of sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> forming well-supported a- and b-clusters within their respective subtypes. in the spotted gar genome only single copies of the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> sequences were found, and these branch basal to the respective teleost-specific a- and b-duplicate clusters, which strongly supports the duplication of sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> early in the teleost lineage. taken together this means that some teleost species may have up to eight different sstr family members, including an sstr subtype that has not been previously described. in our analyses, the zebrafish genome has this repertoire of receptors: sstr <dig>  -2a, -2b, -3a, -3b, -5a, -5b and - <dig> 

the known drosophila allatostatin c receptor  <dig> and  <dig> sequences called drostar <dig> and drostar <dig> were included in the phylogenetic analyses due to their close sequence and functional similarity with the mammalian somatostatin receptor  <cit> . these sequences cluster together basal to the vertebrate sstr sequences and most probably represent an independent duplication event. it was not possible to identify true sstr orthologs in the tunicates ciona intestinalis and ciona savignyi, or in the florida lancelet  branchiostoma floridae.

syntenic gene families
in addition to making a phylogenetic tree of somatostatin receptors in vertebrates, our aim was to determine whether the sstr genes were duplicated in the chromosome doublings in 2r. to test this hypothesis, syntenic  gene families in the sstr gene-bearing chromosome regions were analyzed with respect to their phylogenies, using both neighbor joining  and phyml methods, and the chromosomal locations of the member genes . in total,  <dig> syntenic gene families were analyzed. our results of the conserved synteny analyses are presented as tables comparing the chromosomal locations of all the identified syntenic family member genes in the genomes of human, chicken, zebrafish, stickleback and medaka. due to size restrictions, the tables have been included as additional data files . the phylogenetic trees of all the neighboring gene families have also been included as additional files . these tables and phylogenetic trees are the bases for our description of the results below.

conserved synteny analysis of the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> chromosome regions
the chromosomal locations of the sstr genes as well as the early divergence of two ancestral sstr branches in the phylogenetic tree suggested that the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> genes derive from one ancestral sstr gene, and the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> genes from a separate ancestral sstr gene, and that these two ancestral genes were located in distinct paralogons . therefore two separate analyses of conserved synteny were done. to investigate whether the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> genes arose by duplications of a single ancestral gene in 2r we have carried out phylogenetic analyses of  <dig> syntenic gene families and the chromosomal locations of all neighboring family members were noted and compared between species . in summary, all but two of the  <dig> identified syntenic gene families in the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> chromosome blocks  have phylogenetic trees that either support or are consistent with duplications early in vertebrate evolution . these gene families have tree topologies with subtype clusters diverging in the same time window as 2r, i.e., after the divergence of invertebrate chordates and vertebrates but before the divergence of lobe-finned fishes  and ray-finned fishes . the phyml topologies of the rin and pyg gene families are shown as examples in figure  <dig>  several gene families also have teleost-specific duplicate clusters, supporting subsequent duplications in 3r, see for example pygm and rin <dig> clusters in figure  <dig> as well as the teleost flrt <dig> orthologs . some of the neighboring families have inconsistencies between the nj and phyml trees , however they were considered supportive if they showed the topology described above for at least one of the methods.

the positional and phylogenetic data combined demonstrate the conserved synteny between the chromosome blocks containing sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> in the analyzed genomes. in the human genome, these correspond to well-defined regions on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  and to a lesser degree  <dig> and  <dig>  although no sstr6-bearing chromosomal region was used in the selection of syntenic gene families, the ism , pyg , rin  and slc24a  families have members neighboring the sstr <dig> genes in one or several of the teleost genomes . this dataset also shows that rearrangements between the homologous chromosome regions have been common in the teleost lineage. for example, genes located on both chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> in the human genome have orthologs that are distributed primarily between chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the zebrafish genome in a way that suggests the substantive exchange of paralogs between these regions. this can be seen for the teleost orthologs of the pygl and pygb genes compared with the rin <dig> and rin <dig> orthologs . in the stickleback and medaka genomes there seems to have been fewer rearrangements: orthologs of genes located on human chromosome  <dig> are located on stickleback linkage group xv between approximately  <dig>  and  <dig> mb, and on medaka chromosome  <dig> between approximately  <dig> and  <dig>  mb, which suggests translocation of small chromosomal blocks .

conserved synteny analysis of the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> chromosome regions
for the investigation of paralogy relationships between the chromosomal regions that harbor the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> genes,  <dig> syntenic gene families were analyzed as described above for the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and -6-bearing chromosome regions. to identify these gene families, the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and -5-bearing chromosome regions in the chicken and stickleback genomes were analyzed for conserved synteny . two separate starting points  were used because the chromosomal locations of the sstr genes in the teleost genomes, with sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> homologs located on the same chromosome, suggest a different expansion scenario than the tetrapod genomes, including chicken . in this way we could collect a dataset of neighboring gene families without favoring one scenario over the other. in summary,  <dig> of the  <dig> syntenic gene families in the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> chromosome blocks have tree topologies that support an expansion from one ancestral vertebrate gene through 2r . four are consistent with 2r, but show some inconsistencies between phylogenetic methods  - adap , fam <dig> , rph3a and tom <dig>  - while only two are considered inconclusive - cabp  and gga  . many of the analyzed families also show topologies that support the duplication of family members in 3r. the phyml topologies of the grin <dig> family  and of the fng and fscn families  are shown as examples.

.

as described previously, the chromosomal locations of all neighboring family members were compared between species  and the phylogenetic tree topologies of the neighboring gene families were used to infer the paralogy and orthology relationships. the identified conserved synteny blocks correspond to regions of human chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the human genome. this dataset shows that there have been extensive chromosome rearrangements between the paralogous chromosome regions in the teleost genomes, and to some extent in the human genome. for example, many gene families with members on chicken chromosome  <dig> have orthologs distributed between human chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  and stickleback linkage groups v, ix and xi. in the zebrafish genome these same gene families have orthologs spread over more chromosomes: most are on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  but there are individual orthologs of two families on chromosome  <dig> and an unmapped genomic scaffold . several of these rearrangements can be seen for members of the grin <dig> , fng and fscn  families, with teleost-specific duplicates in different subtype clusters co-located on the same chromosomes. the human grin2b sequence also seems to have translocated to chromosome  <dig>  the grin2a, -2b and -2c clusters show well-supported teleost duplicate branches, supporting a duplication in 3r . in these branches we observe teleost genes located on the same chromosomes , likely due to the chromosomal rearrangements. the fscn gene family has several teleost sequences located on the same chromosomes, for instance on zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  medaka chromosome  <dig> and stickleback linkage group xi, and the fng family has teleost duplicates in the lfng cluster . however, the topology is not clear for the lfng teleost duplicates. these rearrangements in the teleost lineage likely explain why the sstr2a, -3a and -5a genes also are located in the same chromosomal regions in teleost genomes , as will be discussed below.

a few gene families identified in the analysis of conserved synteny, namely atp2a , cabp , glpr  and rph3a  , have individual paralogs on different chromosomes or genomic scaffolds, as described in supplemental note  <dig> .

discussion
evolution of the sstr family
our phylogenetic analyses of the sstr gene family provide strong support for expansion and diversification in both the 2r and 3r events, giving rise to six different sstr subtype genes early in vertebrate evolution and subsequently expanding the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> branch in the teleost lineage. our evolutionary scheme of the sstr gene family expansion is presented in figure  <dig>  the sixth subtype, which we have called sstr <dig>  was previously unrecognized. we have identified it in the ray-finned fishes, including the spotted gar and the teleosts, as well as in the coelacanth, a member of the lobe-finned fish lineage. thus, it was clearly present before the divergence of lobe-finned and ray-finned fishes. its chromosomal position in the teleosts supports origin in 2r . conversely, the sstr <dig> gene was only identified in the lobe-finned fishes, including tetrapods and the coelacanth. these losses are likely the result of secondary and independent events: sstr <dig> from the lineage leading to tetrapods some time after the divergence of the coelacanth lineage, and sstr <dig> from the ray-finned fish before the divergence of the spotted gar and the lineage leading to teleosts . the topology of the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> branch supports this scenario . all six sstr subtypes that emerged early in vertebrate evolution are represented in the genome of the coelacanth. the additional seventh coelacanth sequence that we have called sstrx is located on the same genomic scaffold with the same orientation as the sstr <dig> sequence  and it clusters in the most basal position in the sstr <dig> cluster. this, together with its branch length in the tree, indicates that it is a lineage-specific duplicate of sstr <dig> with a higher evolutionary rate.


the somatostatin system has been reported to have arisen prior to the divergence of insects and vertebrates, i.e., before the protostome-deuterostome split. drosophila melanogaster and other insects have a somatostatin-like 15-amino-acid peptide that has been named astc for allatostatin c  <cit> . two astc receptors were identified in d. melanogaster, with closest relationship to human somatostatin and opioid receptors  <cit> . the receptors were named drostar <dig> and - <dig> and seem to have arisen through a lineage-specific duplication in insects. we propose that two ancient sstr genes were present before the emergence of vertebrates based on our comparative analyses. however, we were unable to identify any unambiguous sstr family members in the genome databases of the amphioxus branchiostoma floridae, and the tunicates ciona intestinalis and ciona savignyi. the latter are members of the urochordate lineage which constitutes the closest extant relatives of vertebrates  <cit> . a previous analysis of g-protein coupled receptor sequences in the florida lancelet  genome identified several lancelet-specific expansions of somatostatin-, galanin- and opioid receptor-like sequences, totaling  <dig> distinct sequences in this cluster  <cit> . among these sequences,  <dig> cluster together with the human sstr sequences, although the resolution of this phylogenetic analysis is very low. in any case, these lineage-specific duplications preclude the identification of true orthologs to the vertebrate somatostatin receptors, although there are several candidates. we have identified three putative somatostatin receptor sequences in the genome of the sea lamprey petromyzon marinus, and their database identifiers are noted in table s <dig> . however, due to the incomplete status of this genome assembly, and thus the lack of synteny data, we refrain from speculating about their orthology relationships.

somatostatin receptors have been described for several teleost fish species in addition to the ones that we have studied. in each species usually one or a few sequences have been reported, except for goldfish, carassius auratus, where eight sequences have been published  <cit> . our additional tree presented in figure s <dig>  confirms previous suggestions  <cit>  that two of these correspond to sstr <dig> as a result of the goldfish-specific fourth tetraploidization  that took place some 12– <dig> mya  <cit> . other goldfish sequences correspond to subtypes sstr <dig>  sstr3a and sstr3b. the three sstr5-like sequences in goldfish were initially named 5a, 5b, and 5c. the one named 5c is orthologous to 5b in our comparisons and the ones named 5a and 5b appear to be 4r duplicates of 5a . the latter have accumulated as many as  <dig> amino acid differences in this short time period , whereas the sstr <dig> 4r-generated duplicates differ at only  <dig> positions. in the orange-spotted grouper, epinephelus coioides, four sequences have been reported  <cit>  that we can now identify as sstr <dig>  sstr2b, sstr3a, and sstr5a . the sstr <dig> sequence determined in the black ghost knifefish apteronotus albifrons <cit> , an electric fish, is sstr3b, and the two sequences from the cichlid astatotilapia burtoni <cit>  are sstr2a and sstr3a. in the rainbow trout, oncorhynchus mykiss, three sequences have been reported  <cit> . in our additional analysis the two sequences identified as sstr1a and -1b <cit>  can be correctly identified as two copies of sstr <dig> likely resulting from the salmonid fourth tetraploidization .

sstr-bearing chromosome regions were duplicated in vertebrate whole genome duplications
two separate analyses of conserved synteny were carried out in order to test the hypothesis that each of the sstr <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and sstr <dig>  - <dig>  -5-branches of the sstr gene family was multiplied as a result of duplications of two distinct chromosome regions. in total we have compared the chromosomal locations of genes in  <dig> gene families located in sstr-bearing chromosome regions. these positional data were combined with phylogenetic analyses of the gene families to infer the likely orthology and paralogy relationships within each family, as well as to determine the time window of the duplications and chromosome rearrangements. as a whole, these analyses show that the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and -6-bearing chromosome regions on the one hand, and the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and -5-regions on the other, belong to distinct paralogons that were formed by chromosome duplications during the same time period in early vertebrate evolution. using relative dating in the phylogenetic analyses, as well as the species distribution of the genes, we can place the duplication events to the period after the divergence of invertebrate chordates and vertebrates, but before the divergence of lobe-finned fishes  and ray-finned fishes . this means that the identified regions of paralogy likely resulted from duplications of ancestral chromosome regions in the same time window as the early vertebrate tetraploidizations. thus, our analysis provides further support for 2r. our analyses also indicate that these two paralogy regions duplicated further in the time-window of the teleost-specific whole genome duplication 3r, although for the sstr gene family only duplicates of sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> were retained . based on the phylogenetic analyses of the sstr family , these duplicates have been named adding the letters a and b to the gene symbols. our proposed evolutionary scenario for the evolution of the sstr-bearing chromosome regions is presented in figure  <dig> 


the paralogous regions we have identified bearing sstr <dig>  - <dig>  and -6-genes, and sstr <dig>  - <dig> and -5-genes, and the time window for their origin, are consistent with previous large-scale genomic analyses. in the analysis of paralogous chromosome regions in the human genome compared to the branchiostoma floridae genome  <cit>  these regions  correspond to ancestral chordate linkage groups numbered  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, indicating an origin in 2r. a separate reconstruction of the vertebrate ancestral genome  <cit>  also inferred that these regions originated from two separate ancestral chromosomes that quadrupled in 2r. in the latter analysis the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and -6-bearing regions correspond to the ancestral linkage group called g and the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and -5-bearing regions to ancestral linkage group called i. the analysis of the first medaka draft genome  <cit> , as well as the aforementioned reconstruction of the ancestral vertebrate genome, support the conclusion that both paralogous regions duplicated further in 3r, but that there have been several major rearrangements that obscure the paralogy relationships. the medaka genome is an appropriate starting point for the discussion of chromosomal rearrangements in the teleost lineage since it seems to have preserved more of the ancestral teleost genome organization  <cit> .

chromosomal rearrangements in teleost genomes
initially, the locations of the sstr2a, -3a and -5a duplicates in teleost genomes suggested that the expansion of the somatostatin receptor family might have partially occurred through other mechanisms than 2r. in the medaka and stickleback genomes all three paralogs are located within regions of approximately  <dig> mb on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> mb on linkage group xi, respectively. in the zebrafish, sstr2a and -3a are located approximately  <dig> mb apart on chromosome  <dig> while sstr5a is located on chromosome  <dig>  in the green puffer sstr2a and -3a are located approximately  <dig> mb apart on chromosome  <dig> and additionally the sstr3b and -5b genes are co-localized on chromosome  <dig> approximately  <dig> mb apart . these arrangements would suggest that ancestral segmental duplications were involved. however, in all non-teleost genomes, notably that of the spotted gar, the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> paralogs are located on different chromosomes or linkage groups . to make sure that our analysis of conserved synteny did not favor the 2r scenario over the ancestral tandem duplication scenario, both the chicken and the stickleback genomes were used as starting points for the identification of neighboring families in the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> paralogon. for the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> paralogon we parted from the human and chicken genomes, since the locations of the sstr genes did not indicate different expansion scenarios in tetrapods and teleosts. based on the combined positional and phylogenetic data using tetrapods as well as teleosts we conclude that both of the sstr-bearing paralogons have undergone a series of inter- and intra-chromosomal rearrangements in the teleost lineage that obscure the ancestral organization. to deduce these rearrangements we have compared lists of neighboring gene family members in the identified paralogous chromosome regions between the human, chicken, zebrafish, stickleback and medaka genomes. the results of this analysis are presented in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> and our suggested scenario is summarized in figure  <dig> 

the analysis of conserved synteny for the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and -5-paralogy regions shows that many of the gene families, not only sstr, display the same paralog translocations between the homologous chromosome regions generated in 2r. notable examples are the cyth , fscn , gga , grin <dig> , kcnj , kctd , sox  and tnrc  families : in all the analyzed genomes these families have two or three 2r-generated subtype genes located on the same chromosome regions with 3r-generated duplicates on other chromosomes . the grin <dig> phyml tree is shown as an example in figure  <dig> and the fscn phyml tree can be seen in figure  <dig> 

this situation allows us to infer the scenario presented in figure 6: three of the four 2r-generated paralogous chromosome blocks were fused into the same chromosome in the ray-finned fish lineage sometime after the spotted gar had branched off approximately  <dig> mya and before 3r in the teleost lineage  <cit> ). after the 3r event and before the last common ancestor of the studied species, the now duplicated fused chromosome blocks exchanged paralogs and subsequently one of them was split by fission events. in all the analyzed teleost genomes we observe these fused and rearranged regions on at least three chromosomes . there seem to have been more fissions and rearrangements in the zebrafish lineage . it is likely that many of the rearrangements occurred as part of larger blocks and subsequently local rearrangements have jumbled the ancestral order. this scenario is corroborated by the orthology relationships inferred from the phylogenetic analyses of the neighboring families . the fact that it is 2r-generated duplicates that have been co-located by the chromosome fusions, and not primarily 3r-generated duplicates, shows that the fusions occurred before 3r.

. paralogous chromosome regions in the stickleback and zebrafish genomes. more rearrangements could be identified in the zebrafish genome than in the stickleback or medaka genomes.

we could see similar chromosomal rearrangements in the paralogous regions bearing sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> genes, although not to the same extent. due to the lower degree of sstr gene retention after 2r and 3r in this paralogon, fewer neighboring families could be identified as belonging to the paralogy block. nonetheless some gene families seem to have translocated duplicates between homologous chromosomes after 3r . the highest degree of such translocations can be seen in the zebrafish where the abdh , foxa , jag , nin , nkx <dig> , pax , pyg , ralgapa  and vsx  families have duplicates of 2r-generated subtypes located on the same chromosome .

there have been some indications of these translocations in previously published large-scale genomic analyses. for instance, in the analysis of the published medaka genome  <cit>  the rearrangements after 3r between the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and -5-paralogous regions on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are apparent. our analyses allow us to resolve the events in greater detail: we conclude that these rearrangements in the teleost lineage were preceded by fusions of 2r-generated chromosome blocks before 3r, with subsequent paralog translocations and chromosome fissions after 3r . this fusion scenario is supported by a large-scale reconstruction of the ancestral vertebrate genome  <cit> , where these reorganizations were concluded from comparative genomic analyses including the medaka. however, these analyses suggested that the fusions occurred before the divergence of lobe-finned and ray-finned fishes. our conserved synteny analysis on the other hand shows that the tetrapod genomes have no signs of ancestral fusions in this paralogon . together with the locations of the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> genes on different linkage groups in the spotted gar genome , our data instead point towards a time frame for the chromosomal fusions after the divergence of the gar lineage and before 3r in the teleost lineage. both these large-scale analyses also support our scenario for the rearrangements between sstr <dig>  - <dig> and -6-paralogous regions in the teleost lineage after 3r.

the recent mapping of the spotted gar genome  <cit>  concluded that its genome organization is more similar to that of the human genome than to teleost genomes. we were able to predict sequences for all sstr genes except sstr <dig> in the genome of the spotted gar, and located them to five different genomic linkage groups . the cited analyses of conserved synteny between the spotted gar genome and the human, zebrafish and stickleback genomes are concurrent with our own, and demonstrate that the linkage groups we have identified as sstr-bearing in the spotted gar share conserved synteny with sstr-bearing chromosome regions in the other genomes  <cit> ).

it is to be expected that duplicated chromosomes, as well as duplicated chromosomal regions that display similarity, can undergo rearrangements such as translocation to the same chromosome. we were surprised to find that regions that arose as separate chromosomes in 2r, perhaps  <dig> mya, have been fused in the ray-finned fish lineage and subsequently exchanged 2r-generated paralogs after the 3r event approximately  <dig> mya. any such rearrangements require extensive analyses in order to be disentangled. we had completed our comprehensive analyses arriving at the scenario shown in figure  <dig> when the spotted gar genome became available and confirmed our suggested scenario. the teleost rearrangements described here may severely hamper efforts to use conservation of synteny for identification of orthologs between teleosts and other vertebrates. fortunately, the spotted gar constitutes a very important out-group for comparison with chromosomal events involving or surrounding 3r and it will greatly facilitate such analyses  <cit> .

implications for synteny analyses and orthology assignment
our studies of the two vertebrate paralogons bearing sstr genes have potentially far-reaching implications for comparative genomic studies such as analyses of conserved synteny. the identification of conserved synteny is essential for the correct assignment of orthology and paralogy relationships between genes, and therefore for the evolutionary studies of gene families  <cit> .

we describe here how 2r-generated duplicated chromosome blocks fused in the ray-finned fish lineage, and how subsequently these fused blocks duplicated in 3r and exchanged paralogs between each other, likely in blocks, blurring much of the conserved synteny patterns generated by the whole genome duplications. there have also been intra-chromosomal rearrangements within these chromosomal blocks, as well as a fission event splitting one of the 3r-duplicated blocks. at this point it is worth noting that the scenarios describing the evolution of the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and -5-bearing chromosome regions and the sstr <dig>  - <dig> and -6-bearing regions differ, with the latter showing no sign of fusions after 2r and inter-chromosomal exchange of paralogs only after 3r .

these types of rearrangements of the genomic structure make it exceedingly complicated to sort out the evolution of genomic regions and to infer orthology and paralogy relationships within gene families. we show that it is possible to resolve these events if one considers both the positional data between several different genomes as well as the phylogenies of the gene families shared between the chromosome regions. these analyses also demonstrate the importance of having the appropriate out-groups to determine the  time points of the events. we could confirm the likely ancestral paralogy relationships between the chromosome regions by comparing our findings against the genomes of the spotted gar and the coelacanth, which were released during the final stages of our analyses. the spotted gar genome, which has been assembled to linkage groups, proved essential to confirm the ancestral location of the sstr genes on different chromosomes, and therefore to support both the duplication of the chromosome regions in 2r and the time window of the chromosome block fusions.

the chromosomal rearrangements that we have described here undoubtedly complicate the assignment of orthology based on synteny analyses. for the sstr family we found that the assignment of sstr genes to specific subtypes needs to take into consideration firstly that there is a sixth previously undescribed ancestral vertebrate subtype, sstr <dig>  which is more closely related to sstr <dig> and sstr4; secondly, that teleost fishes may have additional paralogs resulting from the shared third whole genome duplication ; and thirdly that additional duplicates have been generated by independent fourth genome duplications in some lineages. the teleost sstr <dig> sequences that we have identified in this study were annotated as sstr1a in the zebrafish genome database and sstr <dig> in the stickleback and fugu genome databases.

CONCLUSIONS
by combining analyses of conserved synteny with phylogenetic data we can conclude that two vertebrate ancestral sstr genes on different chromosomes diversified in the basal vertebrate whole genome duplications, 2r, one giving rise to sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> subtype genes, and one giving rise to sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> subtype genes. the sstr <dig> subtype was previously unrecognized, and could be identified in all teleost fish genomes, the spotted gar genome as well as the genome of the comoran coelacanth. conversely, sstr <dig> subtype genes could only be identified in the analyzed tetrapod genes as well as the coelacanth. taken together these results indicate that six sstr subtype genes were ancestral to both lobe-finned and ray-finned fishes, but that reciprocal losses have occurred. subsequently sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> conserved duplicates from the teleost-specific whole genome duplication, 3r. although there have been losses of sstr subtype genes, the paralogous genome regions could be identified in both tetrapod and teleost genomes. the positional and phylogenetic data from the analysis of conserved synteny indicate that there have been significant rearrangements between paralogous chromosome regions in the teleost genomes, especially between sstr <dig>  - <dig> and -5-bearing chromosome regions. these rearrangements would explain the co-localization of sstr <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> genes in several teleost genomes. that these rearrangements occurred in the teleost lineage is corroborated by comparison with the spotted gar genome, representing a lineage that diverged before teleost evolution.
