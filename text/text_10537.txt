BACKGROUND
the dna in human chromosomes is relatively long  <cit> . in addition to protein-coding genes, the genome includes numerous sequence features including gene deserts  <cit> , a multitude of long noncoding rnas with little or no protein-coding capacity  <cit> , and many islands of cpg-rich sequences  <cit> . cpg islands  include g-tracts and numerous nonmethylated cpgs  <cit> . cpg-richness is a remarkable feature since, generally, bulk genomic dna is depleted of cpg, owing to selective deamination of 5-mec  <cit> . cgis vary in size and cpg content  <cit> . in close proximity  to cgis, there are regions  that contain a lower cpg density than the values computationally selected to define the position of cpg islands  <cit> . sequences  that flank the shores are referred to as shelves  <cit> . sequences beyond the shelves are described as open sea  <cit> . both shores and shelves appear to contribute to developmental and regulatory processes that control cpg methylation patterns in chromosomes leading to gene repression  <cit> .

gene repression and activation are regulated by proteins that interact with dna, by enzymes that modify the core histones in nucleosomes and by proteins that bind modified residues in histones  <cit> . core-histone modifications include methylation , acetylation , phosphorylation , and ubiquitination   <cit> . a conserved domain  catalyzes methylation of h3k <dig>  producing h3k4me <dig>  <cit> . trimethylated h3k <dig> is associated with active or transcriptionally poised chromatin states  <cit> . in mammalian cells, h3k <dig> trimethylation involves several enzymes that include setd1a, set1db, and members of mll family. mll family members are comprised of mll <dig>  mll <dig>  mll <dig>  and mll <dig>  <cit> . in the literature, the human mll <dig> is also referred to as mll, all- <dig>  and mllt1; its official symbol is kmt2a. in our studies, we refer to human kmt2b as mll <dig>  to kmt2c as mll <dig>  and to kmt2d as mll <dig> 

earlier studies discovered the mll <dig> gene through its involvement in chromosome translocations that cause acute leukemia  <cit> . translocations often produce abnormal proteins consisting of the amino-terminus of mll <dig> fused in frame to the carboxyl terminus of another protein  <cit> . the normal form of mll <dig> is relatively large and contains several domains: a plant homeodomain, a bromo domain, a transactivation domain, a set domain, and a cysteine-rich cxxc domain  <cit> . the cxxc domain is known as mt since it shows sequence similarity to dna methyltransferases  <cit> . a similar domain exists in mll <dig> and cxxc <dig> . even though the mt domain in mll <dig> and cxxc <dig> binds non-methylated cpg containing sequences  <cit> , swapping experiments have shown that cxxc domains have specific and nonredundant activities that impact downstream regulatory functions  <cit> . colony forming ability and leukemogenicity of a fusion protein  was abrogated when the mll-derived segment was replaced with the dna binding domain of cxxc <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, even though mll <dig> and mll <dig> displayed almost indistinguishable dna-binding properties, their corresponding mt-domains guided the proteins to largely non-overlapping gene repertoires  <cit> .

evidence supports central roles for native forms of mll <dig> in mechanisms that preserve “the memory” of highly active genes during cell division and at specific stages in embryonic development  <cit> . in drosophila, two groups of proteins support heritable memory systems that maintain the transcriptional state of target genes  <cit> . trithorax group  binds trxg response elements  to maintain active states  <cit> . polycomb group  perpetuates repressed states through pcg response elements   <cit> . in drosophila, related dna sequence elements are thought to contribute to the recruitment of both trxg and pcg complexes to chromatin  <cit> . mammalian pcg proteins consist of two groups: polycomb repressive complexes  <dig> and  <dig> , see  <cit>  and references therein. prc <dig> catalyzes mono-ubiquitylation of histone h2a; prc <dig> methylates lysine  <dig> in histone h <dig> producing h3k27me2/me <dig>  <cit> . the prc <dig> complex includes ezh <dig>  eed, and suz <dig>  <cit> . ezh <dig> is the enzymatic component of the prc <dig> complex and produces the repressive h3k27me <dig> marks in nucleosomes  <cit> . interestingly, emerging data indicate that the prc <dig> complex is recruited to chromatin by cpg islands  <cit> .

syndromic manifestations support the opposing functions that mll <dig> and ezh <dig> play in embryonic development. mutations in the ezh <dig> gene cause autosomal dominant weaver syndrome characterized by generalized overgrowth, advanced bone age, marked macrocephaly, hypertelorism, and characteristic facial features  <cit> . de novo mutations in the mll <dig> gene cause wiedemann-steiner syndrome  <cit> . symptoms vary and may include delayed growth and development, asymmetry of the face, hypotonia, and intellectual disability  <cit> . mutations often produce frame-shifts removing downstream domains. studies of mll <dig> knockout mice support a central role for mll <dig> in regulating developmental pathways  <cit> . mll <dig> heterozygous  mice displayed retarded growth, haematopoietic abnormalities, and bidirectional homeotic transformations of the axial skeleton as well as sternal malformations  <cit> . mll <dig> deficiency  was embryonic lethal  <cit> . in mice, mll <dig> was required for maintaining gene expression early in embryogenesis  <cit> , necessary for correct development of multiple tissues, and essential for successful skeletal and neural, and craniofacial development  <cit> .

protein networks that include mll <dig> drive coordinated patterns of gene expression . these networks are organized as hubs that receive and transmit information to activate, upregulate, downregulate, or repress the expression of a given gene  <cit> . components in molecular circuitries include multiprotein complexes that are relatively large and highly dynamic  <cit> . depending on environmental milieu, mll <dig> associates directly or indirectly with numerous regulatory proteins including men <dig>  rbbp <dig>  wdr <dig>  ash2l, hcf <dig>  ledgf, and cxxc <dig> . in protein networks, mll <dig>  hcf <dig>  and cxxc <dig> also communicate with large and dynamic protein complexes that repress transcription . cxxc <dig> binds non-methylated cpg  <cit>  and interacts with h3k <dig> methyltransferases known as set1a/ setd1a and set1b/ setd1b . these enzymes play a more widespread role in h3k <dig> trimethylation than do mll <dig> complexes in mammalian cells  <cit> . these and related findings indicate that in addition to h3k <dig> methylation, mll <dig> performs histone methyltransferase-independent functions  <cit> .

as the main component in trithorax-based regulation networks, mll <dig> plays a central role in preserving transcriptional memory during mitosis  <cit> . analyses of synchronized human cells identified a globally rearranged pattern of mll <dig> occupancy during mitosis in a manner favoring genes that were highly transcribed during the interphase stage of cell-cycle  <cit> . however, how mll <dig> bookmarks genes to maintain transcriptional memory has not been addressed. the finding that gene-bookmarking by mll <dig> is largely independent of the methylation status of h3k <dig> on mitotic chromosomes  <cit>  provokes the question of whether interactions of mll <dig> with genomic dna may play a role in bookmarking events that preserve the memory of highly transcribed genes at the onset of mitosis. to explore this question, we have analyzed data concerning interactions of mll <dig> with dna and chromatin. we show that dna sequences that bind the mll <dig> mt-domain can be described as minimal units or morphemes: the smallest ‘words’ in dna that selectively bind the mt-domain in mll <dig>  we find that the mll <dig> morphemes occur in chromatin segments that are bookmarked by mll <dig> during mitosis. furthermore, we show that frequent morpheme occurrences map to genomic sequences that correspond to cgis. collectively, our results suggest that cgis include tres that bind mll <dig> to maintain the memory of highly active genes at the onset of mitosis.

RESULTS
localization of cpg-rich motifs in promoters of human protein-coding genes
protein coding genes are transcribed by rna polymerase ii . earlier studies deduced that mll <dig> exclusively regulated the expression of homeotic genes and proper segmental identity in mammals  <cit> . however, emerging data indicate that mll <dig> associates with a substantial fraction of human polii promoters, supporting a global role for mll <dig> in regulation of transcription  <cit> .

to uncover sequence motifs that may selectively interact with mll <dig>  we analyzed sequences of  <dig> cloned inserts that the mt-domain in mll <dig> selected in dna binding assays  <cit> . in  <dig> inserts, we identified motifs consisting of cgcg with 0– <dig> nucleotides between the two cpgs. the remaining  <dig> inserts contained cpg but lacked discernable motifs . to explore the relevance of the identified motifs to gene regulation, we examined a relatively large collection of human polii promoters. we focused on the region upstream of transcription start sites  since this dna segment contributed to formation of protein complexes that regulated initiation of mrna synthesis  <cit> . in promoter selection, we imposed filtering criteria to eliminate redundancy. the final promoter set included nearly  <dig>  sequences. we analyzed this set for occurrences of cgcg, cgncg, and cgnncg. additional file 1: figure s <dig> shows that these motifs are spread across the dna segment that precedes the transcription start sites . motif frequencies steadily increase in sequences approaching proximal promoters and tsss in genomic dna . certain motifs appear more prevalent than others, displaying the following trend: cgnncg > cgncg > cgcg.

lexical units recognized by the mll <dig> mt-domain and their localization to polii promoters
encouraged by results of preliminary promoter analyses, we asked whether the cloned inserts obtained from selex assays included sequence-elements that may correspond to mll <dig> recognition sites. to approach this question, we separated motifs consisting of cgncg and cgnncg according to nucleotides that appeared at n position. we uncovered several motifs, which we refer to equivalently as mll <dig> binding sites, binding units, or morphemes . examples include cgcg, cgtcg or its complement , cggcg or its complement , and cgtacg, a palindromic sequence . thus, the mll <dig> morphemes derived from cgncg include all possible bases at the n position: a, g, c, or t. among the combinatorial permutations of nn , we did not find cggccg, cgaacg, cgatcg, cgagcg, and cgaccg. we refer to these sequences as non-motifs.

results of promoter analyses prompted examination of a sequence pattern that appeared frequently at the 5′ boundary of human polii genes  <cit> . this pattern consists of bvscgssscb: where b corresponds to c, g, or t; v to a, c, or g; s to c or g. we find that this pattern describes three of the mll <dig> morphemes , supporting a possible role for such morphemes in regulation of transcription. additionally, earlier studies analyzed human polii promoters for frequently occurring 8-mers and 9-mers  <cit> . when ranked according to statistical criteria, including occurrences in total human genomic dna, we find that a relatively large proportion of promoter 9-mers are composed of cpg-rich sequences  <cit>  that include mll <dig> morphemes.

therefore, we reanalyzed the polii promoter set for morpheme occurrences . we find that as observed for cgcg, cgncg, and cgnncg , the mll <dig> morphemes are spread across polii promoters and their density increases in sequences approaching the tsss . for morpheme frequencies, we observe the following trend: cgcg > cggcg > cgacg > cgcccg > cggacg > cgcgcg > cgtgcg > cgtacg . in toto, results of complementary analyses support a role for mll <dig> morphemes in promoter-associated functions.

morpheme occurrences in functional dna sequences
since the mll <dig> morphemes were identified from the results of selex assays, we asked whether the morphemes have any relevance to sequences that bind mll <dig> in a cellular context. in literature surveys, we found studies that dealt with interactions of mll <dig> with both synthetic and naturally occurring dna sequences  <cit> . one study examined a naturally occurring dna derived from the proximal gc-box in the hsv tk promoter  <cit> . we found that the gc-box in the hsv tk promoter included a sequence  produced from two overlapping mll <dig> morphemes: cggcg and cgcg . in transient expression assays, the gc-box recruited mll <dig> to dna to activate expression of a linked reporter gene  <cit> . this finding supports a role for mll1-dna interactions in activation of transcription. furthermore, amino acid substitutions in the region encompassing the mt-domain abrogated transcription and reporter gene activation  <cit> . these findings support a role for interactions of the mt-domain with dna in the regulation of transcription.

results of another study provide evidence for functionality of mll <dig> morphemes in vivo. specifically, in an upstream promoter of the mouse hoxa <dig> gene, the study localized several cpg-rich clusters that were associated with mll <dig>  <cit> . gene-knockout experiments showed that mll <dig> was required for protection of the cpg clusters from methylation  <cit> . we find that the cpg clusters in the hoxa <dig> promoter include mll <dig> morphemes . isolated morphemes include cgcg, cgccg, and cgcgcg. a mll-protected cluster  is produced from overlap of cgggcg and cgggcg. thus, results of mll-knockout experiments provide support for a role for mll <dig> morphemes in an in vivo context.

morpheme occurrences in cpg islands
the finding that the mll <dig> morphemes are cpg-rich raises the question of whether they are localized in cgis in order to recruit mll <dig> to chromatin. however, since the morphemes are relatively short a priori one could suspect that they may appear frequently in human genomic dna just by chance: once every 256 bps for a 4-nucleotide motif; once every 1024 bps for a 5-nucleotide motif; once every 4094 bps for a 6-nucleotide motif. to examine this issue, we counted morpheme occurrences in total human genomic dna. we find that morpheme frequencies in genomic dna are relatively low. for example: cgcg  occurs once per  <dig>  bps; cgacg/cgtcg  occurs once per  <dig>  bps; and cgcgcg  occurs once per  <dig> ,669 bps.

to evaluate more rigorously a possible connection between mll <dig> morphemes and cgis, we followed a previously described statistical model  <cit> . the statistical procedure partitions the human genome according to occurrences of a given mll <dig> morpheme in cgis and in regions outside cgis. the probabilistic model assumes that the total genomic dna is generated by a memoryless or markov source. the statistical derivations are based on the principle of large deviations, often referred to as p-value analyses  <cit> . results revealed that frequent morpheme occurrences in cgis were statistically significant with β ≈ 10- <dig> .

to further assess a possible association of mll <dig> morphemes with cgis, we examined individual human chromosomes and total genomic dna for morpheme occurrences. the analysis compared expected frequencies for random occurrences to observed morpheme frequencies in cgis. we found that morpheme-occurrences in cgis exceeded the values expected for random distribution in each human chromosome and in total genomic dna .

for morpheme frequencies in cgis, we noted the following trend: cgcg > cgccg/ cggcg > cgcccg/ cgggcg > cgcgcg > cgtcg/ cgacg > cgtgcg /cgcacg > cgtccg/cggacg > cgtacg. as expected, the frequencies are influenced by morpheme-length. nonetheless, the trend indicates a bias in favor of gc-rich morphemes. for example, in cgis, a 5-bp morpheme  occurred  <dig>  times while cgtcg/ cgacg occurred  <dig>  times. in cgis, a 6 bp morpheme  occurred  <dig>  times while cgtgcg /cgcacg occurred  <dig>  times. overall, the observed trend is consistent with a possible connection between mll <dig> morphemes and cgis since a high g + c content is a hallmark of sequences localized in cpg islands  <cit> .

additionally, we performed statistical evaluations of cpg-rich motifs that did not appear in results of selex assays. the analysis revealed that the non-motifs also are associated with cgis. however, except for cggccg, the overall frequencies of non-motifs in cgis were much lower than those observed for mll <dig> morphemes . for example: in cgis, cgagcg/cgctcg occurs  <dig>  times; cgaccg/ cggtcg occurs  <dig> ; cgaacg/cgttcg occurs  <dig>  times; cgatcg occurs  <dig>  times.

occurrences of mll <dig> morphemes in classified polii promoters
human polii promoters can be classified into three groups: group i  does not have a cpg island at their tss. group ii  has a single cpg island at their tss. group iii  has two or more cpg islands in the vicinity of their tsss  <cit> . generally, the density of cpg dinucleotides in genomic dna positively correlates with positions of h3k4me <dig> marks in chromatin, indicating that these two properties are mechanistically linked  <cit> . cpg-rich promoters may be enriched in rna polymerase ii poised for transcription  <cit> . in contrast, by default, at-rich promoters are transcriptionally inactive .

promoter classifications  <cit>  led us to examine the distribution pattern of mll <dig> morphemes in human genomic dna with respect to cgi positions, overall cpg occurrences, and h3k4me <dig> modification patterns. we present three representative examples, chosen for comparison with results of polii promoter classification  <cit> . the first example covers a region that does not include a cgi . the depicted segment is about  <dig>  bp long. it includes a protein-coding gene , many cpgs but not a cgi. figure  <dig> shows that mll <dig> morphemes are scattered throughout the segment, possibly reflecting random occurrences . as observed previously  <cit> , we did not find h3k4me <dig> marks for nucleosomes associated with that region in human genomic dna .

the second example shows a region that includes a single cgi  <cit>  encompassing tsss of various polr1b transcripts . consistent with sequence characteristics of cgis, frequency of cpg dinucleotides is relatively high within the island and tails into flanking sequences designated in literature as shores and shelves . the mll <dig> morphemes are primarily localized within the island . layers of h3k4me <dig> marks encompass the cpg island and extend into the island’s shores and shelves.

the third example shows a dna segment that contains several cgis and includes a region spanning a protein-coding gene known as six <dig> <cit> . figure  <dig> shows that the mll <dig> morphemes are densely packed within the islands. in contrast, the distribution of cpgs occurrences is significantly more broad and extends to surrounding shores and shelves of the cgis. as noted previously  <cit> , the h3k4me <dig> marks encompass the regions that includes a high cpg density. since six <dig> functions in myogenesis  <cit> , h3k4me <dig> marks are primarily observed for hsmm cells, human skeletal muscle myoblast .

morpheme occurrences in human hox loci
in both drosophila and vertebrates, the homeotic genes play essential roles in correct patterning of the body plan  <cit> . trxg complexes and pcg complexes maintain the expression pattern of genes localized in appropriate domains  <cit> . as in mice, the human homeotic genes are organized into four clusters: hoxa, hoxb, hoxc, and hoxd <cit> . this group of genes encode a family of transcription factors that play fundamental roles in morphogenesis during development  <cit> . notably, several genes in the clusters include known mll <dig> targets  <cit> .

numerous cgis are spread across the human hox loci: about 31– <dig> cgis/locus . in these loci, the mll <dig> morphemes are primarily localized in cgis and in some cases tail into the shores and shelves of the islands . a cgi may be associated with a bidirectional promoter regulating the expression of a hox gene and a noncoding rna. examples include a cgi that include hoxa <dig> and hotairm promoters . transcription of hotairm <dig> originates from the same cpg island that embeds the start site of hoxa <dig> <cit> . similarly, a cgi encompasses a bidirectional promoter that regulates the expression of hoxa <dig> and hottip . transcription of hottip produces a noncoding rna, implicated in maintaining active chromatin to coordinate the expression of genes in hoxa locus  <cit> . transcription initiation site of another noncoding rna gene  is within a cgi that includes the coding region of hoxd <dig> .

in the human hoxa locus, a previous study discovered extensive mll <dig> binding events to a transcriptionally active chromatin domain  <cit> . in chip assays of a human monocytic cell-line , mll <dig> was localized to chromatin segments encompassing hoxa <dig> and the 5′ hoxa subcluster including hoxa <dig>  hoxa <dig>  hoxa <dig>  hoxa <dig>  and hoxa <dig> . binding of mll <dig> to these genes correlated with high-levels of their expression  <cit> . we find that mll <dig> morphemes occur frequently in chromatin regions with which mll <dig> associates .

we cover several examples illustrating the correspondence of morpheme occurrences to cgis in human hoxa locus and to mll <dig> associated regions determined by chip assays  <cit> . these regions are marked by horizontal brown-bars in figure  <dig>  chip assays localized an mll-bound segment that included the tss of hoxa <dig>  extending into the transcribed region of the gene  <cit> . we find that the corresponding genomic dna segment encompasses two cgis that contain clusters of mll <dig> morphemes . a short mll-associated chromatin segment includes the hoxa <dig> promoter and extends to the second exon in hoxa <dig> <cit> . the mll-bound segment is within a cgi that contains two clusters of mll <dig> morphemes . a long mll-bound segment encompasses four cgis that include several clusters of morpheme. a shorter mll <dig> associated segment overlaps with a cgi that includes a cluster of morphemes; similarly sized mll-bound segments also encompass cgis that contain clusters of mll <dig> morphemes .

in the human hoxb locus, cgis are associated with promoters of several genes including hoxb <dig>  hoxb <dig>  and hoxb <dig> . intra- and inter-genic islands occur often and include both isolated and overlapping mll <dig> morphemes . the hoxc locus primarily contains intra- and inter-genic cgis . hoxc <dig>  hoxc <dig>  and hoxc <dig> promoters are within cgis that extend into coding sequences. these cgis also include mll <dig> morphemes . tsss of genes in hoxd locus are often within cgis that contain mll <dig> morphemes . examples include cgis encompassing hoxd <dig>  hoxd <dig>  hoxd <dig>  hoxd <dig>  hoxd <dig>  and hoxd <dig> promoters .

morpheme occurrences in chromatin regions bookmarked by mll <dig> during mitosis
to further assess the relevance of mll <dig> morphemes to biological functions, we examined chromosomal regions reported to bind mll <dig> during mitosis  <cit> . binding of mll <dig> to these regions preserved the memory of genes that were highly active prior to the onset of cell division  <cit> . the assays primarily focused on regions encompassing promoter sequences of polii genes  <cit> . therefore, we analyzed results of chip assays to determine whether the mll-bound chromatin segments mapped to cgis and to evaluate whether the bookmarked segments included mll <dig> morphemes. we cover three representative examples, selected to compare our findings to figures discussed in a previous publication  <cit> . the first example deals with association of mll <dig> with a chromatin segment that includes the tss of eef1a <dig> gene. this association appeared exclusively in mitotic chromosomes  <cit> . the mll-bound segment included the major tss of eef1a <dig>  extending into the first exon and the first intron of the gene . we find that the corresponding genomic dna is within a cgi and includes clusters of both isolated and overlapping mll <dig> morphemes .

the second example covers the association of mll <dig> with the myc locus . chip assays revealed that mll <dig> was preferentially bound to the myc locus during mitosis whereas polii occupied the locus in the interphase stage of cell-cycle  <cit> . in mitotic chromosomes, the mll1-associated chromatin segment included sequences from ~ <dig>  kb upstream to ~1 kb downstream of the tss of myc <cit> . the corresponding dna segment encompasses a cgi that contains numerous clusters of mll <dig> morphemes . pabpc <dig> locus provides an example of numerous occurrences of both isolated and overlapping morphemes in a region bookmarked by mll <dig> during mitosis  <cit> . the bookmarked segment  is within a cgi that spans the promoter, the first exon, and part of the first intron of pabpc <dig> gene . mll <dig> morphemes are spread across the dna segment localized in chip assays . the segment includes several morpheme-overlaps produced from permutations of cgcg, cgccg, cgcccg, and complements of these sequences. examples include cgcgccg, cgccgcg, cgcgggcg, cgcggcg, cgcggcg in pabpc <dig> promoter. notably, the pabpc <dig> associated cgi contains multiple occurrences of morphemes that also occur in a region that in vivo mll <dig> protected from cpg methylation .

on gene bookmarking during mitosis
overall, results of our analyses implied that interactions of mll <dig> with its morphemes may contribute to gene bookmarking events that preserved the memory of genes that were highly active prior to mitosis  <cit> . however, evidence is lacking for involvement of other mll <dig> family members in gene bookmarking events. as mll <dig>  mll2/kmt2b binds non-methylated cpgs  <cit> . furthermore, a study has shown binding of mll <dig> to a polii promoter within a cpg island  <cit> . however, chip assays revealed that mll <dig> was evicted from mitotic chromatin indicating that mll <dig> did not contribute to gene bookmarking during mitosis  <cit> . the structure of the other two family members  does not contain an mt-domain. therefore, it seems unlikely that mll <dig> and mll <dig> would interact with cpg rich motifs localized in cpg islands.

mll <dig> is a component of relatively large and dynamic multiprotein complexes  <cit> . therefore, one may ask whether other components in these complexes would contribute to gene-bookmarking by mll <dig>  <cit> . in protein networks, mll <dig> interacts with several proteins, including men <dig>  rbbp <dig>  and ash2l  <cit> , . all three proteins associate with mll <dig> during both interphase and mitosis  <cit> . in mll-deficient cells, most of rbbp <dig>  ash2l, and men <dig> were localized to the cytoplasm, indicating that their association with mitotic chromatin was mll-dependent  <cit> . even though men <dig> interacts with dna, the binding is not dna-sequence-specific  <cit> . men <dig> also associates with a variety of dna structures, including y-structures, branched structures, and 4-way junction structures  <cit> . in literature surveys, we did not find evidence for direct interactions of men <dig> with cpg-containing sequences. furthermore, while during mitotic silencing of highly expressed genes men <dig> was associated with mitotic chromatin, mll <dig> was required for this association  <cit> .

other candidates for gene-bookmarking include ledgf/p <dig> . ledgf is best known for its role in tethering to chromatin protein-complexes that integrate the hiv- <dig> genome into the host-cell chromosomes  <cit> . ledgf primarily associates with chromatin in regions downstream of tsss, to effect gene-specific hiv- <dig> integration  <cit> . furthermore, in contrast to mll <dig>  <cit> , ledgf does not bind cpg-rich dna sequences.

since mll <dig> is best known for its h3k <dig> methyltransferase activity, one may expect that gene bookmarking by mll <dig> could involve mechanisms dealing with trimethylation of histone h <dig>  <cit> . however, mll <dig> was dispensable for preserving histone h3k <dig> methylation during mitosis, indicating that mll <dig> served h3k <dig> methyltransferase-independent functions to propagate active chromatin during mitosis  <cit> . furthermore, during mitosis, setd1a was evicted from mitotic chromosomes, implying that it did not contribute to gene-bookmarking events  <cit> . setd1a is the major h3k <dig> methyltransferase during the interphase and targets many nucleosome-associated genes for histone h <dig> modifications  <cit> . both setd1a and setd1b interact with a protein  that binds unmethylated cpg  <cit> , figure  <dig>  earlier genome-wide studies localized cxxc <dig> to cgis and deduced that cxxc <dig> functions included recruitment of setd1a and setd1b to chromatin for trimethylation of h3k <dig>  <cit> . however, subsequent studies revealed that while cxxc <dig> played a key role in organizing genome-wide h3k4me <dig> in mouse es cells, its dna binding domain was not required for recruitment of enzymes that produced h3k4me <dig> marks on cgi-associated nucleosomes  <cit> . while cxxc <dig> is crucial for early embryonic development and regulates genomic cytosine methylation patterns  <cit> , it remains to be determined whether cxxc <dig> may also play a role in gene bookmarking during mitosis.

occurrences of overlapping mll <dig> morphemes
we noted that in some cases, morphemes overlapped in various orders and combinations. based on statistical criteria , occurrences of morpheme overlaps in cgis are even rarer events than those obtained for isolated morphemes. we found that morpheme overlaps creating long sequences appeared infrequently in human genomic dna. we noticed that morpheme overlaps could be produced from a repeated dna sequence element. examples include cgg repeats associated with genetic abnormalities. n creates morpheme overlaps of the following form: cggcggcggcggcggcgg etc.

notable examples include the fmr <dig> locus in which cgg expansion causes mental retardation  <cit> . this expansion arises in a cgi associated with fragile x syndrome, in the 5′ untranslated region of the fmr <dig> gene  <cit> . in normal individuals, repeat-size varies from  <dig> to  <dig> cgg  <cit> . all alleles with greater than  <dig> repeats, including those identified in a normal family, are mitotically unstable  <cit> . remarkably, in carriers fmr <dig> transcription increases, displaying a positive correlation between repeat number and levels of fmr <dig> transcripts  <cit> . additionally, carriers display changes in tss utilization  <cit> . thus, repeated overlapping morphemes, downstream of transcription initiation sites, may influence tss utilization and upregulation of gene expression.

several overlapping mll <dig> morphemes are dispersed across the human hox loci . in some cases morpheme overlaps are localized upstream or near tss of specific genes. examples include morpheme overlaps in promoter/upstream sequences of genes in various loci: cgcgcgcgcg, hoxa4; cgcccgcccgccgcccgcccg hoxa6; cgcccgcgcccggcg, hoxa7; cggcgcgcgcg, hoxa11; two repeats , hoxc8; and cggcggcggcggcg, hoxd <dig> 

in some cases, overlapping morphemes are localized in coding regions producing repeated amino acid residues in a polypeptide chain. notable examples include morpheme overlaps in hoxa <dig> and hoxd <dig> coding sequences producing tracts of alanines. amplification of dna sequences in a hoxd <dig> exon causes syndactyly, fusion of digits in fingers  <cit> . it is thought that syndactyly is due to expansion of alanine-tracts  <cit> . however, it seems plausible that overlapping morphemes in coding sequences may play a regulatory role at the level of gene expression. in fact, an emerging view is that gene regulatory and coding sequences are more intermingled than once believed  <cit> .

statistical criteria indicate that morpheme overlaps are rare events in genomic dna, raising the question of whether occurrences of overlapping morphemes could play a role in cellular functions regulated by mll <dig>  in this context, we noted that a previous study found that the set domain in mll <dig> self-associated to form homo-oligomeric complexes  <cit> . this association was observed in various experimental settings including yeast two-hybrid methodology, biochemical studies, and deletion analyses  <cit> . the study found a similar self-association for the set domain in the drosophila trithorax  <cit> .

in leukemogenic mll <dig> fusion proteins, the set domain is deleted and replaced with over  <dig> different translocation partners  <cit> . invariably, the mll <dig> mt-domain is retained at the amino-terminus of fusion proteins  <cit> . mll <dig> fusion partners include transcriptional activators that upregulate gene expression in leukemic cells. also, there are partners that impart transcriptional activating properties to mll <dig> fusion proteins by promoting dimerization  <cit> . dimerization of fusion proteins immortalized hematopoietic cells by upregulating transcription of several endogenous genes  <cit> . interestingly, protein-dimerization enhanced the binding of mll <dig> amino-terminus to regulatory regions leading to upregulation of linked genes  <cit> .

since normal forms of mll <dig> self-associate via the set domain  <cit>  to produces homo-oligomeric complexes  <cit> , it seems plausible that as observed for leukemic cells  <cit> , association of mll <dig> molecules could enhance the affinity of mll <dig> for dna. furthermore, self-association might operate in linking mll <dig> molecules so that they would reside simultaneously on different maintenance elements in chromosomes  <cit> . this mechanism would integrate the activity of mll <dig> in activation of a target gene, shared target genes, or both  <cit> . propagation of mll <dig> association with dna may arise from a combination of two molecular events: binding of mll <dig> to overlapping morphemes and mll <dig> oligomerization via the set domain. cooperative dna binding, via self-association, often increases the dna binding specificity of a protein. we imagine that overlapping mll <dig> morphemes may facilitate mll <dig> self-association linking mll <dig> molecules to reside cooperatively on dna sequence elements  that maintain cellular memory during development. our data indicate that such tres also could function in gene-bookmarking to preserve the memory of highly active genes during mitosis. also, one could imagine that overlapping morpheme occurrences may facilitate localized propagation of mll <dig> binding to dna to maintain a nucleosome-free region and, thus, an open chromatin configuration.

CONCLUSIONS
annotation of the human genome has involved numerous experimental and computational strategies to identify and describe dna sequences that are important to cellular functions. however, despite cutting-edge advances, we lack a complete understanding of the function of cpg islands, which were discovered some time ago  <cit> . results of our analysis provide suggestive evidence for specific sequence motifs in cgis that may function in the recruitment of mll <dig> to mitotic chromatin. we show that various combinations of mll <dig> morphemes occur in chromatin regions bookmarked by mll <dig> during mitosis  <cit> . thus, our results implicate the mll <dig> morphemes in sequence-features that define the mammalian tres. our results also suggest a role for overlapping morphemes in producing multiple mll <dig> binding events, linking mll <dig> molecules so that they would reside simultaneously on different maintenance elements in chromosomes, as previously proposed  <cit> .

our findings also may explain why cgis often extend to include promoter, exonic, and intronic sequences of genes. by binding cgis, mll <dig> might preserve and maintain an open chromatin configuration to regulate gene expression and to facilitate rapid gene activation upon mitotic exit. association of mll <dig> with cgis agrees with a global role for mll <dig> in regulation of transcription  <cit> .

apparently, our findings provide the first evidence for the existence of potential tres in mammalian genomic dna and the first evidence for a connection between cgis and gene-bookmarking by mll <dig> to transmit the memory of highly active chromatin states during cell-division. because of the strong connection of tres and pres in drosophila <cit> , we speculate that the mll <dig> morphemes may play a dual role:  contribute directly to the recruitment of mammalian trxg complexes to chromatin and  contribute indirectly, or directly, to the recruitment of prc <dig> complexes to chromatin to repress transcription. this possibility is consistent with the finding that the mammalian prc <dig> repressive complex binds cgis  <cit>  and our discovery of frequent occurrences of mll <dig> morphemes in cpg islands.
