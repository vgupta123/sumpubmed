BACKGROUND
helicobacter pylori  is a spiral-shaped, gram-negative bacterium that infects half the world's population and is the major cause of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers and gastric malignancies, including gastric non-cardia adenocarcinoma and mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma  <cit> . most infected individuals present with no clinical symptoms, but approximately 10~20% will develop peptic ulcers and 1% will develop gastric cancer  <cit> , which could be associated with the diversity of h. pylori.

h. pylori exhibits exceptionally high rates of dna point mutations and intra- and inter-genomic recombination. recently, many molecular typing tools have been developed to investigate genetic relatedness among h. pylori isolates. however, these methods have limitations including lower discrimination power, or preventing results from different labs being compared  <cit> .

in  <dig>  mlva analysis was proposed as a general approach to providing accurate, portable data that were appropriate for the epidemiological investigation of bacterial pathogens  <cit> . however, there's little information concerning populations of h. pylori species using mlva. whether this method is available for the h. pylori population is still uncertain.

h. pylori infections in china are common and extensively distributed, with an average infection rate of about 58%. in this study,  <dig> vntr loci of the h. pylori genome were identified and used to analyze  <dig> strains of h. pylori which originated from different regions of china and japan.

RESULTS
multi-vntr loci for h. pylori genome
pcr products amplified from the reference strains  <dig>  hpag <dig> and j <dig> were identical to the published sequences sizes. of the locus vntr- <dig> and vntr- <dig>  the pcr products sequencing were consistence with our electrophoresis results. the exact number of tandem repeats at each locus could be determined from the sizes of the pcr products.

in this study,  <dig> vntr loci were candidated from the h. pylori database. and we finally identified  <dig> vntr loci using analysis, which were also distributed throughout the h. pylori genome . there's no variation in the other  <dig> loci, which were removed in the following study. the variation in repeat numbers is divergence at the  <dig> vntr loci. the main characteristics of the  <dig> vntr loci are listed in table  <dig>  including the diversity index of each locus.

clustering trend of the strains from different regions and ethnic groups
a mlva system to the molecular typing of h. pylori strains has been developed. on the basis of the  <dig> vntr loci, the profiles of each isolate were obtained . the clinical h. pylori strains were divided into  <dig> mts, which has not been described previously. according to cluster analysis, most strains from the same focus presented with the same or similar mts . in addition, strains from the same focus were dispersed in the cluster tree. as shown in figure  <dig>  the  <dig> %  of the tokyo isolates had very similar mts and could be clustered into group a. one of the remaining tokyo isolates belonged to the group c, and the others were scattered distribution. of the southern and eastern chinese isolates,  <dig> %  were clustered into group b, including b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> subgroups, and the rest strains were related to group a, c and d. of the isolates from northern china,  <dig> % were clustered into two major branches, groups c <dig>  and c <dig> , and other strains were scattered. of the western china isolates,  <dig> %  were clustered into group d. the strains tibet  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were related to group a, tibet  <dig> and tibet  <dig> were related to group b <dig> and c <dig> 

a minimum spanning tree was constructed on the basis of strains from different ethnic groups:  <dig> tibetan,  <dig> mongolian,  <dig> yamato as well as  <dig> han . there was a tendency to cluster into four main subgroups. however, there're still some exceptions, such as the hangzhou- <dig> and  <dig>  of han strains , were related to the tibetan strains group. tibetan strains  <dig> and  <dig> , were related to the mongolian group, and mongolian  <dig>  , was related to the japanese group.

correlation between h. pylori mts and the related diseases
among the  <dig> samples,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of patients presented with non-ulcer dyspepsia , gastritis , peptic ulcer  and gastric cancer , respectively. and in our study there's no significant relationship between the h. pylori mts and the related diseases.

discussion
recently, many bacterial genomes have been fully sequenced, and analysis of the sequenced genomes has revealed the presence of variable proportions of repeats, including tandem repeats. short repeat motifs undergo frequent variation in the number of repeated units. mlva is an appropriate method for bacterial typing and identification, for determining genetic diversity, and for the tracing-back of highly mono-morphological species  <cit> . the mlva typing was reported to have a high-quality species identification capability and a high discriminatory power. the method has been used in the analysis of many bacteria  <cit> , but little research has been carried out in h. pylori. therefore, this study established the h. pylori mlva system and applied to type clinical strains.

the h. pylori genome has a number of repeat sequences, and their repeat number results in divergence. the  <dig> loci identified were distributed throughout the genome. these loci had different variations in different isolates and were able to typing h. pylori successfully.

the h. pylori mts were clustered with ethnic groups, consistent with the previous reports  <cit> . the han strains were selected from southern china and had little relationship to mongolian strains from northern china or tibetan strains from western china. it may demonstrate an apparent cluster tendency in different regions and ethnic groups, but there were some exceptions, which may because, unlike other asian countries with relatively homogeneous populations, china has a heterogeneous population from various ethnic groups. therefore, there may be more opportunity for dna transfer between strains of different genotypes in china than other countries. while tibet is a relatively closed region, h. pylori strains from this area have a good cluster.

the h. pylori genome shows a high degree of genetic diversity among strains  <cit> , but weakly clonal groupings of different diseases were detected, and these could be superimposed on a pattern of free recombination. and the relationship between particular h. pylori genotype and related disease has not been sure.

mlva is a useful molecular tool for epidemiological investigations and recognition of laboratory cross-contamination  <cit> . vntr analysis thus provides multiple independent characteristics for phylogenetic analysis. studies have indicated that mlva is sufficient to resolve closely related isolates. in contrast, combining loci with lower variability values is suitable for establishing clear phylogenetic patterns among strains that have evolved over a longer time period. theoretically, the greater the number of loci used, the higher the discriminatory power that can be achieved, and subtler phylogenetic relationships among bacterial strains can be established.

at the present time, the mlva was established and applied to examine the clonal relationships between h. pylori isolates from china and japan. the loci used in this study provided high discriminatory power and successfully separated isolates of different strains from different geographical areas. and there was a particularly evident of h. pylori from tibet, a relatively closed region, which showed better cluster than other ethnic groups. the data will aid in the development of a genomic polymorphism database of h. pylori. we have established a preliminary profile of mlva but more information is required for a comprehensive profile.

china is a large country containing  <dig> ethnic groups and a large population. therefore, further studies are required including isolates from more regions and over several more time-frames.

CONCLUSIONS
the studies indicated that mlva method, based on  <dig> vntr loci, is sufficient to resolve closely related isolates for the purpose of h. pylori genotyping analysis. this study used mlva methodology provided a new perspective on the ethnic groups distribution characteristics of h. pylori.
