BACKGROUND
dna microarray technology  <cit>  has rapidly advanced due to the intrinsic and unprecedented ability to simultaneously measure gene expression on a whole genome basis. microarray technology continues to develop and is widely cited as offering much utility for translational science, from improved drug discovery, including target discovery, to improved clinical diagnostics and disease stage determination, prognostics and treatment selection, and more. with the prospect of microarray-derived biomarkers being applied in clinical applications, the bar is substantially raised for identification of informative genes enabling accurate classifiers, and efforts to this end are prevalent in the literature  <cit> . more specifically, there is a compelling need to identify a subset of genes from among the more than  <dig>  in the entire genome that allow robust classifiers to be developed. the difficulty and challenge is to overcome the intrinsic characteristics of microarray data that contains a substantially small number of samples when compared to the number of genes  <cit> . these characteristics lead to the risk of fitting to noise as genes with high variability unrelated to phenotype masquerade as informative genes. the truly differentiating signals derived from small numbers of experimental replicates are difficult to distinguish in the sea of noise, leading to the appearance of unstable  significant gene lists  <cit> .

gene selection is synonymous with feature selection or variable selection in machine learning, a process extensively used to mitigate the so called "curse of dimensionality"  <cit> . generally, gene selection is done for either hypothesis testing or hypothesis generation. selecting a subset of genes as molecular signatures or biomarkers that could be used for developing a generalized and accurate classifier for differentiating phenotypes is a hypothesis testing process  <cit> , wherein rigorous validation is needed. on the other hand, identifying a list of putatively relevant genes related to a phenotype or endpoint of interest for subsequent research is a hypothesis generating process  <cit> , wherein validation of the genes is much more relaxed; the genes so identified often shed light on the fundamental molecular mechanisms and biological processes under study.

selecting and validating an "optimal" set of genes for a molecular signature or biomarker for a robust classifier is a complicated and time-consuming task. an exhaustive search encompassing all possible gene subsets to find the set yielding the smallest error can be an intractable computational task. worse still, because the number of genes far outnumber samples, the potential for fitting to random noise is high, making stringent testing and validation essential  <cit> .

most methods to select informative genes for classification model development reported in the literature rely on ranked genes by fold change, correlation coefficient, or p-value from a t-statistic, wilcoxon statistic, or analysis of variance , or some combination of these  <cit> . to a greater or lesser degree, all of these methods yield an informative gene list varying on the sample size, which has led doubt on microarray reliability  <cit> . in theory, true phenotype differentiating genes should be expected to express consistently with each other regardless of the sample size. in other words, the list of informative genes as well as the underlying mechanisms inferred by these genes should have nothing to do with the sample size.

in this study, a bagging  <cit>  based new hybrid gene selection approach was investigated to identify informative genes. the rationale of the approach is that informative genes should consistently show significance for different variations of sample size. accordingly, many re-sampling iterations are conducted to generate different variations of sample size and the frequency of genes exhibiting significance throughout the iterations formed the basis for identification of the informative genes that are considered as a very important pool  of genes. in reality, the vip genes can be identified using any existing gene selection approach or their combinations and can be used to derive molecular signatures to build robust classifiers with good generalization capability, or to narrow subsequent research to reveal relevant, fundamental molecular mechanisms in biological processes. in this study, t-statistic and discriminatory analysis are used to evaluate the significance of genes. in the t-statistic, the significant genes are identified based on p-values. in the discriminatory analysis, disjoint principal component analyses  are conducted for each class of samples, and those genes with high discrimination power   <cit>  are identified as significant genes. the vip genes are those having high frequency of showing significance in the re-sampling iterations. the utility of the proposed approach was demonstrated with nine diverse microarray datasets for identifying the informative genes for classifier development and compared with commonly used p-value ranking gene selection approaches.

RESULTS
the vip gene selection approach for microarray based molecular signatures was applied to the nine publicly available microarray gene expression datasets described in table  <dig>  for the purpose of comparison, the p-value ranking method was also used. for each dataset, an unbiased sample splitting, gene selection, and validation dataset prediction process as depicted in figure  <dig> was carried out. briefly, a dataset is first randomly split into a training set with two thirds of the samples and a validation set with the remaining samples. with validation samples set aside, gene selection and classifier development are done using the training samples. two lists of  <dig> genes are selected, one using the proposed vip gene selection approach and the other using p-value ranking. the p-value ranking is based on an unpaired, two-tailed t-statistic with pooled variance estimate. in order to exam whether the vip gene selection approach can identify informative genes or not, three sets of classifiers were generated, one for the vip genes, one for the p-value genes and another for the genes uniquely identified by the vip method . a nearest-centroid <cit>  classification method was used to develop classifiers. these classifiers are applied to predict the validation samples. the prediction performance of classifiers were compared by accuracies, specificities, sensitivities, and the matthew's correlation coefficients . the definitions of these measures are given in the section titled "materials and methods". the sample splitting, gene selection, and validation dataset prediction steps were repeated  <dig> times for adequate statistics.

we first compared the classifiers based on the vip genes with those from the p-value ranking. as shown in table  <dig>  the vip classifiers exhibited somewhat better performance compared to the classifiers from the p-value selected genes. the p-values from t-statistic for accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and mcc between two groups of classifiers  are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. therefore, at the  <dig>  confidence level, the improvement of classifier measured in mcc and accuracy is significant, but not for specificity and sensitivity. the results indicate that the vip genes may convey more, but not less, biologically relevant information than the p-value selected genes.

next, to determine whether the unique genes indeed contribute to the sample differentiation and thus biological relevance, we compared prediction performance of the classifiers built from unique genes with those built from the p-value ranked genes across the nine datasets. the average number of unique genes for each dataset is also listed in table  <dig>  it was shown that the average performance metrics  for classifiers built from unique genes  are not very different from those built from top  <dig> p-value ranked genes for all nine datasets. the difference of each pair of average performance metrics is respectively tested across nine datasets with a null hypothesis that the compared performance metrics  is not very different from each other by using a paired and two-tailed t-statistic. the p-values given by t-statistic are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and mcc respectively. apparently, the differences of all prediction performance metrics among classifiers are not significant at the  <dig>  confidence level. this suggests that the unique vip genes are statistically equivalent as those identified by p-value ranking in distinguishing different types of samples. therefore, these unique genes could be an additional subset of genes which are equally as important as those selected with p-value ranking. the existence of additional subsets of classifying genes may imply that there exist multiple biological processes for studied endpoints or co-factors.

lastly, to gain more understanding of the vip genes in terms of biology related to the investigated dataset, we further examined the unique genes as well as the common genes shared by the p-value method in the van't veer dataset using pathart  through the fda genomic tool, arraytrack . pathart is a pathway analysis tool that contains disease related canonical pathways manually created from the literature. the van't veer dataset contains  <dig> unique genes and  <dig> common genes. of  <dig> unique genes, ten genes were found in pathart and were listed in table  <dig>  most of these ten genes involve biological processes related to various cancers; for example, igfbp <dig> and mmp <dig> are directly related to breast cancer. we also examined the pathways associated with the  <dig> common genes and found seven unique genes were involved in seven pathways identified by the common genes . these results demonstrate that the unique genes not identified by the p-value ranking could convey additional important information for biological interpretation.

discussion
quantitatively assessing the effectiveness of gene selection methods can be problematic owing to several limitations among which selection bias caused by information leakage from training phase to validation phase figures prominently  <cit> . the most severe bias was described by ambroise et al.  <cit>  and simon et al.  <cit>  as occurring when identifying genes from the entire dataset  and using them in cross-validation. wessels et al.  <cit>  and lai et al.  <cit>  describe a less severe bias. typically, the training samples are used to generate a series of gene subsets, while the performance of a classifier trained with the training samples and tested with the validation samples is applied to estimate the informativeness of each gene subset. the bias derives from the fact that the validation samples are used to select the best performing gene subset. since optimization of the gene subset is part of the training process, selection of the best gene subset should be conducted with the training samples only. this process as shown in figure  <dig> has been carried out in this study to assess the utility of the proposed vip gene selection method by entirely avoiding bias due to information leakage from validation dataset in training phase.

classification method selection is another important aspect of developing predictive models from microarray expression data. many classifiers are created with one or more adjustable parameters that affect not only the prediction accuracy but also the complexity of the classifiers and the computational expense of their use. the proper adjustment of the tuneable parameters can affect the fairness of comparative predictive performance assessments. for example, the relatively simple k-nearest neighbour  <cit>  classification method has a tuneable k in the prediction rules. adjusting k requires some validation process be carried out. generally, different validation strategies such as leave-one-out cross validation, k-fold cross-validation, or monte carlo validation, will yield different preferred values of k. other classification approaches, such as support vector machine   <cit> , partial least squares discriminant analysis   <cit> , random forest  <cit> , and artificial neural networks   <cit>  are considerably more complex by comparison, causing more work and computational cost. according to wessels et al.  <cit> , michiels et al.  <cit> , and lai et al.  <cit> , choosing a classification method with a limited complexity can help prevent over-training, thus providing a more robust predictor. in this study, the simple classification approach nearest-centroid was used to develop and compare classifiers based on unique vip genes and top  <dig> p-value ranked genes. since the method lacks a tuneable parameter, risks of overtraining are lessened compared to other methods, as are the chances that differences in prediction accuracy are due to method rather than selected genes.

commonly used gene selection approaches in dna microarray data analysis, such as p-value ranking or fold change ranking and others, assume that all genes are stochastic variables that are unrelated to each for purposes of calculating significance. this assumption is inconsistent with the actual biological processes where most genes have some interdependency to and are interlinked with other genes through complex mechanisms and pathways. in contrast, the proposed vip gene selection approach uses both dps and p-values to assess the discriminatory capability of genes in differentiating sample types. dps are calculated from two independent pcas that fuse discriminating information across whole genes. the interdependence and interlinking effects among genes are embedded within the dp calculation, enhancing rather than reducing many aspects of actual biological processes. furthermore, the bagging re-sampling technique, which has been used to analyze microarray data for clustering  <cit>  and classification  <cit> , is used here to mitigate the chance selection of genes. compared with p-value ranking-type gene selection approaches, the proposed vip gene selection has great potential to select additional informative genes that can be useful for either biological insights or to improve the prediction performance of classifiers.

CONCLUSIONS
the new hybrid gene selection approach was investigated for identifying vip genes from nine diverse gene expression datasets. the vip gene selection approach quantifies discriminatory capability for differentiating sample classes using both discrimination analysis and p-value ranking through a bagging sampling process. the classifiers built from those unique vip genes showed comparable prediction capability to those built from the top  <dig> t-statistic based p-value ranked genes in predicting the types of unknown samples. therefore, the vip gene selection approach could provide an additional subset of genes which are of equivalent performance as those selected with the t-statistic based p-value ranking. the subset of vip genes could convey additional biological information in terms of associated biological pathways and mechanisms during hypothesis generation. similarly, the vip genes could be used to improve molecular fingerprints for use in clinical biomarkers.

algorithm
the vip gene selection approach combines discriminatory powers derived from two independent principal component analyses and p values from t-statistic to filter genes based on a bagging, re-sampling technique. the algorithmic process is depicted in figure  <dig>  where the training dataset is composed of n <dig> samples of class  <dig> and n <dig> samples of class  <dig>  samples of class  <dig> and class  <dig> are represented by the matrices x <dig> and x <dig>  respectively. the vip genes are chosen through the following steps:

 <dig>  randomly select 75% of samples from the training data, x <dig> and x <dig>  using a bagging, re-sampling strategy. the selected samples are represented with x1m for class  <dig> and x2m for class  <dig> 

 <dig>  rank genes by their p-values and only keep the top  <dig> genes for next step. p-values are calculated from a two-tailed and unpaired t-statistic with pooled variance estimate  on x1m and x2m. the remaining data are represented by x1m' and x2m', respectively.

 <dig>  rank genes based on their discrimination powers  and the increment the frequencies of the top  <dig> genes by one. the calculation of dps is described in detail in the next section "calculation of discrimination power".

 <dig>  repeat steps one through three  <dig> times.

 <dig>  rank genes by frequencies and choose the top  <dig> genes as vip genes.

calculation of discrimination power
dps are calculated from two independent principal component analyses . pca is performed on each p-value-filtered data, x1m' and x2m' from step  <dig>  the optimum number of components for each pca is determined using malinowski's factor indicator function   <cit>  with eqs.  – :

  x = tp 

  rek=∑i=k+1gλip 

  indk=rek <dig>  

where x is either x1m' and x2m'; t and p are the score and loading matrices of the pca; λi is the ith eigenvalue of the total g eigenvalues; and n and p are the number of samples and the number of genes in the matrix x, respectively. the optimum number  of components for the pca is the one that yields the minimum ind value. the discrimination power  for a gene j can be calculated with eq. :

  dpj=t+tt+t, 

where ej <dig>  ej <dig>  ej <dig>  and ej <dig> are the j columns of matrices e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig>  respectively. e <dig> and e <dig> are the residue matrices after projecting x1m' into the pca spaces of class  <dig> and class  <dig>  respectively, while e <dig> and e <dig> are the residue matrices after projecting x2m' into the pca spaces of class  <dig> and class  <dig>  respectively. a residue matrix is calculated with eq. .

  e = x - xppt, 

where e is one of the four residue matrices e <dig>  e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> 

prediction performance
the prediction performance of a nearest-centroid classifier in this study is characterized with four metrics: accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and the matthew's correlation coefficient . the metrics can be calculated from the prediction confusion matrix shown in table  <dig> as follows:

  accuracy=tp+tntp+tn+fp+fn 

  specificity=tntn+fp 

  sensitivity=tptp+fn 

  mcc=tp×tn−fp×fn×××, 

where tp, tn, fp, fn are respectively the numbers of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions in the confusion matrix .
