BACKGROUND
plant growth is inhibited by many forms of abiotic stress, including intense light  <cit> , nitrogen and phosphorus starvation  <cit> , water stress/high salinity  <cit>  and extreme temperatures  <cit> . excess light induces the re-organization of the photosynthetic apparatus to facilitate light harvesting while avoiding potentially damaging effects. concomitantly, metabolism is redirected towards the synthesis of protective compounds such as flavonoids  <cit> , tocopherol and carotenoids  <cit> , which participate directly in stress responses.

the chloroplast is a crucial intersection for environmental stimuli  <cit> . short-term responses to excess light, elicited in a timeframe of seconds to minutes, include enhanced thermal dissipation of light energy  <cit>  and detachment of the outer antenna system from the photosystem ii  reaction centre  <cit> . longer-term acclimation responses include an increase in the psi/psii ratio, and the production of rubisco, cytochrome b6/f complexes and atpase at higher levels in order to increase the rate of o <dig> evolution under saturating light conditions and avoid plastoquinone  over-reduction. moreover, the capacity for thermal energy dissipation  increases as psbs accumulates  <cit> .

although cytochrome b6/f, atpase and rubisco are encoded by chloroplast genes, the vast majority of plastid polypeptides are encoded by nuclear genes and are imported as precursors through the plastid envelope  <cit> . acclimatory responses therefore require the coordinated regulation of plastid and nuclear genes, which involves a retrograde signal  <cit> . in the last decade transcriptome analysis has confirmed the importance and sophistication of this regulatory network  <cit> , but the signals and transduction pathways are not yet fully understood. proposed signalling molecules include mg-protoporphyrin ix  <cit> , which couples the rate of chlorophyll synthesis to the expression of nuclear-encoded pigment-binding proteins, and the redox equilibrium of plastoquinone   <cit> . however, mg-protoporphyrin ix is absent under conditions leading to the repression of nuclear genes  <cit> , and only  <dig> nuclear genes appear to be controlled by the pq redox state and photosynthetic electron flow   <cit> , casting doubt on their proposed role. furthermore, analysis of the barley viridis zb <dig> mutant  suggests that the expression of photosynthesis-related genes is not coupled to the redox state of pq  <cit> .

reactive oxygen species  have recently been proposed as candidate signalling molecules in acclimation because they can modulate gene expression when added to cell culture media, and gene expression patterns are altered in mutants accumulating higher or lower levels of ros  <cit> . although renowned for the damage they cause to proteins, lipids and nucleic acids  <cit> , ros also have several important physiological functions such as defence against pathogens  <cit>  and the regulation of plant development  <cit> . plants have evolved a complex regulatory network to mediate abiotic stress responses based on ros synthesis, scavenging and signalling, although more work is needed to decipher the signalling pathways and the crosstalk between them  <cit> . signals representing environmental changes are the first important step leading to plant acclimation and survival  <cit> .

we exposed arabidopsis thaliana plants to intense light at low temperatures, which strongly inhibits photosynthetic electron flow and reduces psii efficiency, leading to the over-excitation of pigments and the accumulation of singlet oxygen , a peculiar ros species that is the first excited electronic state of molecular oxygen  <cit> . we compared wild-type plants to the double mutant npq1lut <dig>  which lacks violaxanthin de-epoxidase  and lycopene-ε-cyclase  activities, and therefore cannot synthesize two major photoprotective xanthophylls: lutein and zeaxanthin. these molecules help to quench chlorophyll triplet states  and scavenge 1o <dig> released within the thylakoid membrane  <cit> . due to the defect in xanthophyll composition, the npq1lut <dig> mutant exhibits a remarkable sensitivity to high light  <cit>  and accumulates higher levels of 1o <dig> than wild-type plants, while the accumulation of other ros is unaffected as are other putative retrograde signals such as the pq redox state and the atp/adp ratio. the system that gave a great breakthrough in the study of 1o <dig> accumulation in plants is the conditional flu mutant. this mutant in the dark accumulates protochlorophyllide that acts as a photosensitizer upon illumination and generates 1o <dig> in the stroma of chloroplasts  <cit> . in flu, 1o <dig> accumulation mediates the activation of a stress response  <cit>  that is different from those induced by other ros such as superoxide anion  or hydrogen peroxide   <cit> . further results showed that executer1/ <dig> are chloroplast proteins crucial for 1o2-mediated stress responses  <cit> . however, xanthophyll mutants have been recently used to study the effect and the signalling pathway of 1o <dig> <cit> . we are clearly dealing with two different systems that accumulate 1o <dig>  the most studied that depends on 1o <dig> steady-state accumulation from chlorophyll precursors and the second one that depends on the photoprotective activity of xanthophylls in thylakoid membranes. in the first case the toxic effect of 1o <dig> has a major role in defining the phenotype, while in npq1lut <dig> its effect as signal molecule is more important. we applied stress conditions within a physiological range, leading to acclimation rather than the apoptotic responses reported in previous studies  <cit> . by limiting cross-talk between the apoptotic and acclimatory signal transduction pathways, we found that 1o <dig> can function as a signal in both wild-type and npq1lut <dig> mutants under oxidative stress.

RESULTS
genes regulated by intense light at low temperatures in wild-type and mutant plants
an affymetrix genechip® arabidopsis ath <dig> genome array was used to compare the transcriptional footprints of wild-type arabidopsis thaliana plants and the npq1lut <dig> mutant when both were transferred at 10°c and exposed to either very low light levels  or very high light levels  for  <dig> or  <dig> h . three biological replicates were analyzed in each treatment group. these conditions  were carefully chosen in order to emphasize the effect caused by the lack of the two photoprotective xanthophylls  <cit> .

we noted that many genes were similarly regulated by light at low temperatures regardless of the genetic background, i.e. they were not influenced by the mutations. we have first compared different time points for each genotype to identify genes responding in the same way in both genotypes. these genes represent the response to high-light and low-temperature conditions in our experiment. among the rapidly-responding genes ,  <dig> were modulated in both wild-type and mutant plants, all showing the same directional response in both backgrounds . among the delayed-response genes ,  <dig> genes were modulated in both backgrounds, again all showing the same directional response .

functional classification of the above genes was carried out using funcat version  <dig>   <cit>  and the most significant results  are summarized in table  <dig>  a complete list with subcategories is provided in additional file 1: table s <dig>  many of the genes  fell into the cell rescue, interaction with cell environment and interaction with the environment categories, which are generally associated with stress responses or hormone signalling. among the down-regulated genes, there was a significant over-representation of those in the control of transcription and cell wall biogenesis functional categories, whereas many genes involved in primary and secondary metabolism were up-regulated . for example, a change in l-phenylalanine metabolism, reflecting the overexpression of chloroplast chorismate mutase  and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase  <dig> , could serve as a secondary pathway for the synthesis of phenylpropanoids and flavonoids. additional file 1: table s <dig> shows that photosynthesis, energy conversion and regeneration, and light absorption are down-regulated after  <dig> h, possibly because energy pathways are overloaded and therefore feedback-inhibited when constantly exposed to intense light.

function and cellular localization of genes regulated by intense light  in both wild-type and npq1lut <dig> mutant plants. functional categories and their consistency were defined using mips functional catalogue . up-regulated and down-regulated genes were analyzed after  <dig> and  <dig> h stress. for each subset, the number of genes is shown in brackets.

the ten most strongly modulated genes after  <dig> h included several with a regulatory function, which are likely to be involved in the activation of a stress response according to their genevestigator response profiles . these comprised three transcription factors , two heat shock proteins  and one putative allene oxide cyclase . after  <dig> h we observed the strong induction of genes known or suspected to be involved in flavonoid biosynthesis or modification, i.e. dihydroflavonol 4-reductase, dfr, at5g42800; anthocyanin 5-aromatic acyltransferase, aat <dig>  at1g03940-at1g03495; anthocyanin pigment  <dig> protein, pap <dig>  at1g66390; anthocyanin 5-o-glucosyltransferase, at4g14090; flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase, f3'h, at5g07990; myb family transcription factor, myb75/pap <dig>  at1g56650; udp-glucosyl transferase, at5g54060; and anthocyanidin synthase, at4g <dig> . these genes are known to be important checkpoints in flavonoid biosynthesis as shown by microarray experiments performed under various abiotic stress conditions  <cit> .

genes regulated by intense light at low temperatures in mutant plants only
only  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed when unstressed wild type and mutant plants were compared . all  <dig> genes were down-regulated in the mutant, suggesting that the two backgrounds are metabolically very similar when there is no stress and that the  <dig> genes may be directly influenced by the lack of npq <dig> and lut <dig> enzyme activities, or of the corresponding products .

following exposure to intense light, the number of differentially expressed genes increased dramatically. after  <dig> h,  <dig> genes were up-regulated in the mutant and  <dig> down-regulated, and after  <dig> h,  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated . the distribution of functional categories among these genes was similar to the genes modulated in the same manner in both backgrounds. however, a distinct group of  <dig> genes specifically repressed in the wild type plants after  <dig> h of stress but not repressed in the mutant  was shown to encode chloroplast proteins ,  <dig> with no known function and others identified as transcription factors and pentatricopeptide repeat-containing proteins , possibly participating in ros signal transduction from the chloroplast to the nucleus and vice versa  <cit> . this indicates that nuclear gene expression might be influenced by carotenoid composition and anti-oxidant activity in thylakoid membranes, especially when plants are placed under oxidative stress.

the table shows the subset of genes encoding chloroplast proteins. the ratio between treated and control plants is expressed as a log <dig> scale. for each sample, the average of three repetitions is presented.

focusing on differences in expression levels , we noticed that genes encoding heat-shock proteins  were more strongly up-regulated in the mutant after  <dig> h, as were those encoding antioxidant proteins such as 2-alkenal reductase , which catalyzes the reduction of the α,β-unsatured bond of reactive carbonyls  <cit> , methionine sulfoxide reductase  <dig> , which promotes thioredoxin-dependent reduction of oxidized methionine residues in ros-damaged proteins  <cit> , and the oxidative stress protein rubredoxin   <cit> . a squalene monooxygenase  <dig>  gene  is 12x more strongly repressed in wild type plants than in mutants and might be the base for changes in plant morphology or oxidative stress response in hl conditions  <cit> .

gene clustering
we next carried out a k-means cluster analysis, which organized all modulated genes into  <dig> clusters that differed little between wild-type and npq1lut <dig> . therefore, an implemented cluster analysis was performed using a quality threshold algorithm , in which we only considered genes with differences in transcript levels between the two genotypes at the three time points, i.e.  <dig> genes for time  <dig>   <dig> genes for time  <dig> h and  <dig> genes for time  <dig> h . the minimum number of probe-sets per cluster was fixed at  <dig>  with a pearson's correlation value fixed at  <dig> . the number of clusters increased to  <dig>  plus a group of  <dig> unclassified genes . once again, there were few differences between the genotypes, with the exception of e.g. clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  cluster  <dig> attracted our attention because it showed the most striking difference between wild-type and npq1lut <dig> plants, and is strongly enriched in chloroplast genes . indeed, among the  <dig> probes in the arabidopsis ath <dig> genome array representing genes in the chloroplast genome , five belong to cluster  <dig>  one of these genes encodes a protein hypothetically involved in psi assembly , two encode photosystem core complex proteins, psbb from psii  and psaa from psi , and two encode atpase subunits . other genes in cluster  <dig> encode a transcription factor regulating the cryptochrome response , an l-ascorbate oxidase , a kinase  and two unknown proteins . all these genes are modulated by intense light at low temperature in the wild-type, while there is no response in the mutant.

this table shows the subset of genes in cluster  <dig>  the ratio between npq1lut <dig> and wild-type plants after  <dig> h stress is expressed using a log <dig> scale. for each sample, the average of three repetitions is presented.

ros analysis in wild-type and npq1lut <dig> leaves
the npq1lut <dig> mutant was chosen because of its high sensitivity to photooxidative stress  <cit> . we determined the composition of ros species released after the onset of illumination by infiltrating wild-type and mutant leaves with highly specific ros-sensor probes: singlet-oxygen sensor green  for 1o <dig>  dichlorofluorescein  for h2o <dig> and oh., and proxyl-fluorescammine  for o2- and oh. <cit> . all these probes show an increase in fluorescence emission in the presence of their specific trigger ros, and the signal can be detected directly on the surface of an illuminated leaf using a fiber-optic fluorimeter. in particular, among all available probes specific for 1o <dig>  we chose sosg because, unlike other available fluorescent and chemiluminescent 1o <dig> detection reagents, it does not show any appreciable response to hydroxyl radical, h2o <dig> or superoxide anion; moreover, it was successfully applied to 1o <dig> detection in several systems, e.g. bacteria  <cit> , diatoms  <cit> , higher plants  <cit>  and pigment-protein complexes isolated from higher plants  <cit> . furthermore, c. flors and co-workers applied sosg to a range of biological systems that are known to generate 1o <dig> and in all cases, sosg was confirmed as a useful in vivo probe for the detection of 1o <dig>  moreover, since highly sensitive probes for detection of h2o <dig>  o2- and oh.were also used in all measurements, any cross-detection of other ros species than 1o <dig> by sosg can be excluded.

the results in figure  <dig> show that only sosg fluorescence differed according to the genotype, with significantly higher fluorescence in mutant leaves ; there was no significant difference in the dcf and proxf signals . these results show that the accumulation of 1o <dig> is selectively enhanced in npq1lut <dig> mutant leaves whereas the other ros are accumulated at the same level in both the mutant and wild-type. these data were confirmed by determining the extent of protein oxidation in thylakoids using the millipore oxyblot kit: npq1lut <dig> plants showed evidence of increased protein carbonylation after  <dig> day exposure to excess light, whereas wild-type plants took  <dig> days before an increase was detectable and the amplitude of the signal was far lower .

it has been reported that the chloroplast can control the rate of transcription in the nucleus via the redox state of pq  <cit> , the adp/atp ratio and the redox state of stromal components  <cit> . in order to determine whether differences in gene expression between wild-type and mutant plants reflected differences in 1o <dig> steady-state accumulation, we studied the kinetics of these parameters under the same stress conditions described above. there were no major differences in qp, ascorbate and glutathione redox state, and adp/atp ratio, but there was a significantly greater reduction in maximum psii photochemical efficiency  in mutant within the first  <dig> d, which reflects psii damage induced by high 1o <dig> levels .

wt and npq1lut <dig> rosettes were pre-treated for  <dig> hrs at 10°c , then were exposed to photoxidative conditions . leaves were harvested, then used for analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters or immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for measurements of metabolites, at the same time of the day over a 6-day-long stress period. abbreviations: qp, photochemical quenching; fv/fm, maximal psii photochemical efficiency; gsh/gssg, glutathione reduced/oxidized; asc, ascorbate; dha, dehydroascorbate. values that differ significantly between wild type and npq1lut <dig> mutant plants  are marked by an asterisk.

nevertheless, acclimation to stress conditions led to the recovery of fv/fm in both wild-type and npq1lut <dig> plants within  <dig> days . the levels of ascorbate and glutathione increased in both genotypes upon hl treatment. ascorbate accumulates at even higher extent in wild-type leaves than npq1lut <dig> in response to hl. on the contrary, the total amount of atp and adp was only slightly affected by stress treatment in both genotypes .

regulation of photosynthetic pigment metabolism
we next investigated the transcriptional regulation of genes in the chlorophyll and carotenoid metabolic pathways, since these pigments play an important role in light harvesting and photoprotection, and pigment-protein complexes are the main sources of 1o <dig> in thylakoids when the photosynthetic machinery is overexcited  <cit> . specifically, we studied the carotenogenic genes  and the lhc  and psa/psb gene families  to see if their expression was sensitive to hl treatment.

this table presents the subset of genes belonging to each photosystem core complex. the ratio between npq1lut <dig> and wild-type plants after  <dig> h stress is expressed as a log <dig> scale. marked fields represent probe sets with a significant changes after rma analyses.

we identified several genes in the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway that were differentially regulated in wild-type and mutant plants exposed to excess light at low temperature. we found that heme oxygenase  <dig> , which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the degradation of heme, uroporphyrin iii c-methyltransferase , which is involved in siroheme biosynthesis, and glutamate-1-semialdehyde  <dig> -aminomutase  and uroporphyrinogen iii synthase , which catalyze steps in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, were induced much more strongly in the mutant. in contrast, for a gene encoding protochlorophyllide reductase b , which is involved in the light-dependent step of chlorophyllide a biosynthesis, was repressed specifically in the mutant . these results indicate that hl-treatment on npq1lut <dig> plants redirects the porphyrin biosynthetic pathway from chlorophyll synthesis to the production of heme and siroheme, thus reducing the total amount of chlorophyll in the overexcited system. consistently, the chlorophyll content per leaf area decreased more rapidly in mutant plants than wild type plants exposed to excess light .

several genes in the xanthophyll biosynthesis pathway were up-regulated in both wild-type and mutant plants, with stronger induction after  <dig> h. these included phytoene synthase , phytoene dehydrogenase , lycopene-β-cyclase , β-carotene hydroxylase chy <dig>  and zeaxanthin epoxidase . the strong up-regulation of carotenogenic genes in response to elevated irradiation would sustain chloroplast acclimation. the carotenoid content of whole leaves supported this hypothesis, since mutant plants acclimated to a lower chl/car ratio than wild-type plants after  <dig> d exposed to excess light at low temperature , suggesting that 1o <dig> signalling can account for the modulation of xanthophyll content in the thylakoid membrane. the differential expression of vte <dig> in wild-type and mutant plants  is consistent with the higher tocopherol production in the mutant plants exposed to stress conditions .

regulation of pigment-binding proteins
lhc proteins are located within the thylakoid membranes, where they coordinate the chlorophylls and carotenoids. they are encoded by a superfamily of nuclear genes whose transcription  <cit> , translation  <cit>  and protein accumulation  <cit>  are finely regulated in response to environmental cues. the expression profiles of most lhc genes were very similar in wild-type and mutant plants exposed to excess light for  <dig> h . the genes significantly up-regulated in both genotypes were lhcb <dig>  , lhcb <dig> , elip <dig>  and elip <dig> , indicating their involvement in the general stress response. however, lhca <dig>  was significantly down-regulated only in wild-type plants, whereas lhca <dig>  was up-regulated only in the mutant.

furthermore, many genes encoding psii and psi core complex subunits were significantly down-regulated in wild-type plants exposed to excess light, but up-regulated or marginally down-regulated in the mutant, i.e. cp <dig> , d <dig> , psbg , psbi , psbk , psad , psao  and psan . table  <dig> shows the gene expression ratios on the log <dig> scale. marked fields represent probe sets showing a significant change. cp <dig> was more strongly repressed in wild-type compared to mutant plants, with a similar tendency observed for other probe sets such as d <dig> and psaa, for which down-regulation or no modulation was observed in wild-type plants while up-regulation was observed in the mutant. these finding indicate that the main response to excess light at low temperatures is a general repression of photosynthesis-related genes, but hl treatment in mutant leaves results in specific transcriptional re-programming of the core subunits of both photosystems, relieving the transcriptional repression in wild-type leaves. biochemical analysis of thylakoid pigment-protein composition during stress treatment showed that the photosynthetic machinery acclimates by reducing the psii/psi ratio , but there is little change in the antenna size as detected by the lhcii/psii ratio . these results agree with previous reports showing that when psii becomes rate-limiting for photosynthetic electron transport, changes in photosystem stoichiometry occur to counteract this inefficiency  <cit> . although the redox state of pq is the same in both genotypes , genes encoding ps core complexes are differentially expressed and there are differences in the rate at which the psii/psi ratio declines. the faster reduction in the psii/psi ratio in mutant leaves, independent of pq redox state or psii photoinhibition , suggests a ros-dependent signal transduction pathway that facilitates the acclimatory modulation of thylakoid composition.

chloroplast reorganization in response to 1o <dig> accumulation
several signals are thought to pass from the plastid, either directly or indirectly, through the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where they modulate gene expression under stress  <cit> . after acetonic extraction, pigment analysis showed that the chlorophyll a/b ratio was higher in the mutant than the wild-type and this difference increased under stress , reflecting the changing psii/psi ratio in the mutant upon hl treatment  rather than a reduction in antenna size . under stress, lhc transcription was inhibited to the same extent in both genotypes, whereas photosystem core genes were down-regulated more strongly in the wild-type plants. this is consistent with the significant increase in the chl a/b ratio observed in the mutant, but there was no modulation of ftsh expression to explain the more rapid degradation of pigment-protein complexes . the chl/car ratio differs significantly between the two genotypes, with wild-type plants showing a 24% reduction under stress, and mutants showing a 38% reduction . evidence for oxidative stress was found in the pattern of antioxidant compounds, e.g. glutathione s-transferase, methionine sulfoxide reductase and tocopherol . several genes showing induction in npq1lut <dig> only encoded chloroplast proteins, that might be involved in cell protection against the damaging effect of ros . since most were induced after  <dig> h in the mutant, it suggests that induction occurs only when 1o <dig> accumulation exceeds a threshold level .

discussion
we have carried out a comparative analysis of wild-type arabidopsis plants and the double mutant npq1lut <dig> in terms of mrna levels, metabolite levels and physiological functions in response to conditions leading to oxidative stress. the npq1lut <dig> xanthophyll biosynthesis mutant was used to study the effect of 1o <dig> accumulation on physiological stress responses  <cit> . this mutant lacks violaxanthin de-epoxidase  and lycopene-ε-cyclase  activities, and is susceptible to photooxidative stress when exposed to excess light at low temperatures  <cit> . under normal growth conditions the gene expression profile of the mutant is almost identical to that of wild-type plants, but differences become evident following exposure to excess light  at low temperature . at time  <dig> ,  <dig> genes were down-regulated in the mutant relative to wild-type plants, although the expression of those genes could be directly or indirectly regulated by the absence of lutein and zeaxanthin. also, during high light treatments lutein and zeaxanthin could play a signalling role, directly or by compounds derived from them. the effect of individual carotenoids on transcription has not been analyzed in detail, but it is clear that the carotenoid content of the chloroplast affects gene expression under both normal and stress conditions, and affects chloroplast to nucleus communication  <cit> . here, we show that 1o <dig> accumulation in response to excess illumination within the physiological range is perceived as a signal to regulate significant number of nuclear genes encoding chloroplast proteins, facilitating acclimation to stress, but is not sufficient to induce apoptosis.

xanthophyll mutants are valuable for the analysis of 1o <dig> signalling
the suitability of the lut2npq <dig> mutant for the analysis of 1o <dig> signaling was confirmed by comparing physiological parameters and ros accumulation in relation to wild-type plants. previous results  <cit>  showed that lut <dig> mutation in arabidopsis only affected few physiological parameter ; however, photosynthetic efficiency and growth rate in lut <dig> plants were indistinguishable from wild-type. we cannot exclude that differences between the two genotypes at the onset of hl treatment could be responsible of some of the differential responses at transcriptome level. however, wt and npq1lut <dig> accumulate different amounts of 1o <dig> from their chloroplasts before stress treatment  as further confirmed by transcript levels at time  <dig> showing no major differences in gene regulation between wt vs mutant. therefore, if a differential 1o <dig> accumulation occurs even in low light, it is below the threshold level that makes 1o <dig> a signal in the regulation of gene expression.

present results demonstrate that 1o <dig> is the only ros differentially accumulated in the mutant with respect to wt upon hl treatment, while this mutations does not differentially affect the main parameters that, until now, have been related to gene expression regulation in hl. indeed, following illumination at  <dig> μmol m- <dig> s- <dig> and 10°c, the photosynthetic electron transport chain was reduced to the same extent in both genotypes . this allowed us to monitor the impact of excess light on the redox state of the pq pool, a physiological parameter that has been proposed to have a specific role in chloroplast to nucleus signalling during stress acclimation  <cit> ; therefore, the differential gene expression in wild-type vs mutant plants cannot be attributed to changes in the pq redox state, confirming data from previous studies  <cit> . additional proposed signalling molecules, such as reduced forms of ros, the redox state of the stoma redox component , and the atp/adp ratio  <cit>  were indistinguishable in the two genotypes , suggesting they are not major transcriptional regulators in response to photo-oxidative stress conditions used in this report. therefore, all data presented suggest that gene expression changes described could be reasonably ascribed to singlet oxygen, even if we cannot exclude that other factors could act as signal in npq1lut <dig> plants, together with singlet oxygen, in the modulation of gene expression.

the npq1lut <dig> mutant shows a selective loss of lutein, which is active in 3chl* quenching  <cit> , and of zeaxanthin, which is an 1o <dig> scavenger  <cit> , therefore the mutant specifically accumulates 1o <dig> but not other ros   <cit> . it should be noted that the change in xanthophyll composition marginally affects the composition of the photosynthetic apparatus in the mutant  <cit>  while photosynthetic electron transport and growth rate are the same in both genotypes, therefore 1o <dig> steady-state accumulation in the npq1lut <dig> mutant occurs only in response to excess light conditions . thus, npq1lut <dig> compares favourably with the flu mutant  <cit>  in which 1o <dig> is produced through the accumulation of chl biosynthesis precursors, eventually leading to complete chloroplast bleaching. the present study on npq1lut <dig> is the first case in which ros generation has been elicited in its natural site  rather than provided from outside or produced by photosensitizing metabolic precursors soluble in the chloroplast stroma. the level of psii photoinhibition we found in npq1lut <dig> is not dramatic, since the photochemical efficiency of the mutant starts to acclimate to the stressing conditions after  <dig> days of hl . in the flu mutant, over-accumulation of the photosensitizer pchlide results in a stronger photosensitive phenotype, with extensive cell death as early as  <dig> h after the onset of illumination, and visible necrotic lesions formed  <dig> to  <dig> h later. clearly, the level of stress applied in our experiment is far lower from that described in  and is followed by a successful acclimative response as in a physiological response. therefore we strongly support the notion that in our experimental conditions, 1o <dig> acts primarily as a signal that modulates chloroplast acclimation to photoxidative stress.

the photosynthetic parameters and metabolic indicators discussed above  show that the chloroplast function and communication between the chloroplast and cytoplasm are impaired in the mutant, while the differential expression of nuclear genes encoding chloroplast proteins confirms that the chloroplast is a central switch of the plant's response to cold and light stress  <cit> . we can now decipher the contribution of 1o <dig> signalling to the stress acclimation response. a similar system was previously used with the mutant npq1lor <dig> of the green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii. nevertheless, in arabidopsis we identified a fast component of gene expression regulation by 1o <dig> at 2h that was not detected in chlamydomonas  <cit> .

the npq1lut <dig> transcriptome integrates the ros signalling network
oxidative stress is a complex process that can be triggered by a range of environmental, biotic and developmental factors. it is therefore not surprising that different pathways can be induced, depending on the nature of the stress. previous studies using a catalase-deficient mutant exposed to excess light identified genes that are differentially expressed in response to h2o <dig> accumulation, leading to the discovery that h2o <dig> regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis  <cit> . several reports have also proposed that 1o <dig> has a signalling role  <cit> .

here we have determined the photoprotective effect of two xanthophylls when plants are exposed to excess light at low temperatures. only  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed between wild type plants and the npq1lut <dig> mutant under normal conditions, probably reflecting the absence of lutein and zeaxanthin in the mutant . however, when the plants were exposed to excess light at a low temperature, a group of  <dig> genes encoding chloroplast proteins was specifically repressed in wild type plants, whereas the same genes were not affected in the mutant. this is intriguing because a nuclear mutation affecting chloroplast xanthophyll composition is clearly able to regulate gene expression and ultimately chloroplast acclimation. we can thus conclude that the expression of some nuclear genes depends on the xanthophyll content directly or indirectly, via its impact on 1o <dig> accumulation . we do not exclude that lutein, zeaxanthin and products of their metabolisms play a signalling role under stress. indeed, carotenoids can play a clear signalling role  <cit> . here we want to highlight the correlation between gene expression regulation and 1o <dig> steady-state accumulation in a mutant lacking two photoprotective xanthophylls. one possibility is that a subset of genes in table  <dig> responds to the change in 1o <dig> accumulation within the thylakoid membranes, e.g. those encoding glutaredoxin , atp-dependent protease la , dnaj heat shock n-terminal  and enzymes involved in phylloquinone and plastoquinone biosynthesis . functional annotation of the  <dig> uncharacterized genes in this list will help further to decipher how gene regulation by lutein and zeaxanthin occurs under oxidative stress, as shown in previous studies  <cit> .

one group of genes specifically modulated in the npq1lut <dig> mutant overlaps with those regulated in flu , a reference mutant used in the study of 1o <dig> signals  <cit>  in agreement with the high level of 1o <dig> accumulation measured in npq1lut <dig> . also in the attempt of comparing the response in npq1lut <dig> vs flu, we performed a more sophisticated statistical analysis comparing npq1lut <dig> transcriptome and flu/executer transcriptome  <cit> . the conditions used in the two experiments are different as demonstrated by the high number of genes  differentially expressed in the two wild-types . a low level of overlap between npq1lut <dig> and flu/executer transcript response was detectable  showing that transcriptomic analysis performed in different labs under different experimental conditions must be compared with precaution as shown by previous papers  <cit> . comparative transcriptomic analysis of the 1o <dig> response signature showed that the cluster of genes regulated by 1o <dig> in both flu and npq1lut <dig> is not modulated in all oxidative stress cases analyzed to date. however, we identified a subset of genes affected by 1o <dig> and o <dig>  whereas there is negative correlation between the genes modulated by 1o <dig> and those modulated by h2o <dig> . this antagonistic transcriptional regulation mediated by 1o <dig> and h2o <dig> supports previous data showing cross-talk and antagonistic h2o <dig> and 1o <dig> signalling in flu mutants under stress overexpressing the thylakoid-bound ascorbate peroxidase  <cit> . the molecular basis of these opposing responses appears to reflect the presence of specific cis-regulatory elements responsive to either 1o <dig> or h2o <dig> within the corresponding promoters  <cit> . a new and close relationship among ros was recently demonstrated, where each ros species activates a specific response, but the pathways converge to produce a clear 1o <dig> signature in lipid peroxidation  <cit> .

the transcription regulation of genes specifically responding to 1o <dig> in flu and npq1lut <dig> mutants was compared to various experiments by using mutants and/or treatments. the ratio between treated and control plants is expressed as a log <dig> scale. for each sample, the average of three repetitions was considered.

the genome-wide hypersensitive response is more strongly induced in flu mutants than in npq1lut <dig> mutants . among  <dig> genes significantly up-regulated following infection with pseudomonas dc <dig>   <cit> ,  <dig> were also detected in the flu and npq1lut <dig> transcriptomes with  <dig> induced in flu and only  <dig> in npq1lut <dig> . in agreement with this, we did not observe cell death in arabidopsis plants by vital staining and dna fragmentation analysis . because npq1lut <dig> specifically showed higher 1o <dig> steady-state accumulation , this implies that cell death is not a specific or immediate response to 1o <dig> in the absence of the most effective photoprotection mechanisms present in wild-type plants, at least under our experimental conditions. however, we cannot exclude the possibility that higher levels of 1o <dig> accumulated under non-physiological conditions, might induce cell death.

recent work by apel and co-workers revealed that executer genes are involved in the early response to 1o <dig> in arabidopsis by the transduction of 1o <dig> signals from the chloroplast to the nucleus in the flu mutant  <cit> . 1o <dig> accumulation in npq1lut <dig> induced the expression of ex <dig> but not ex <dig>  but there was no effect in similarly-treated wild-type plants, confirming that 1o <dig> oxygen signals are measurable in the npq1lut <dig> transcriptome and that ex <dig> and ex <dig> might respond differently to environmental cues.

xanthophylls modulate the pigment composition of thylakoid membranes
it is well documented that plants acclimate to different light conditions by regulating their carotenoid composition  <cit> . it is worth noting that the higher rate of 1o <dig> accumulation in npq1lut <dig> plants corresponds to the induction of genes representing the β-β branch of carotenoid biosynthesis . in thylakoid membranes, the accumulation of β-β xanthophylls would increase the ability of plants to synthesize zeaxanthin and neoxanthin when needed, thus facilitating the response to excess light. indeed, these β-β xanthophylls have both an important role in photoprotection  <cit>  and mutants lacking such compounds undergo irreversible photo-oxidation when exposed to excess light  <cit> . growth under intense light caused carotenoid levels to increase in npq1lut <dig> plants compared to the wild-type , and because carotenoids scavenge 1o <dig> or directly quench 3chl*, the increased car/chl ratio appears to be a protective mechanism  <cit> .

besides carotenoids, plants synthesize other antioxidants such as tocopherol . this lipophylic compound is localized exclusively in the lipid phase of the thylakoid membranes, and is an active 1o <dig> scavenger  <cit> . higher levels of tocopherol were observed in the leaves of npq <dig> mutant plants after  <dig> d of excess light stress  <cit> , and it was proposed to have a primary role in the prevention of lipid peroxidation promoted by 1o <dig>  we found that npq1lut <dig> plants under chilling stress accumulated tocopherols to higher levels than wild-type plants when exposed to excess light for  <dig> d  and contained ~70% more α-tocopherol. tocopherol synthesis is therefore strongly induced by excess light in the mutant, particularly given the rapid consumption due to the increased rate of ros accumulation. the biochemical analysis was consistent with the transcriptomic data, showing stronger and faster induction of tocopherol synthesis genes in the mutant, e.g. hpd  and vte <dig>  .

tetrapyrrole synthesis must also be regulated under excess light stress to prevent damage to the photosynthetic machinery, and when photo-oxidative stress accelerates the degradation of pigment-protein complexes, the synthesis of chlorophyll must slow down to compensate. we therefore measured changes in the total chl content as well as in chl a/b ratio. the tetrapyrrole pathway is regulated by metabolic intermediates at the transcriptional and post-translational levels  <cit> . in particular, heme is a well known repressor of early steps in the chl synthesis pathway  <cit> . crosstalk between tetrapyrrole biosynthesis and 1o <dig> was demonstrated in flu mutants  <cit> . our data clearly show that the higher levels of 1o <dig> accumulation in npq1lut <dig> mutants promote the expression of heme oxygenase  <dig>  and uroporphyrin iii c-methyltransferase , resulting in higher levels of heme in mutant compared to wild-type plants . furthermore, repression of protochlorophyllide reductase b  in npq1lut <dig> could limit chlorophyll production, helping to reduce the number of pigment-protein complexes in the cell during chloroplast acclimation to excess light.

1o <dig> therefore appears to participate in a fine-tuning system that modulates chlorophyll biosynthesis and the accumulation of carotenoids and lipophylic antioxidant compounds in excess light stress, thereby increasing plant fitness under normal illumination.

xanthophylls affect the composition of the photosynthetic apparatus during acclimation
light-harvesting complexes respond rapidly to changes in environmental conditions  <cit> . we showed that most lhc genes have similar expression profiles in wild type and npq1lut <dig> mutant plants, even though they encode proteins that bind lutein and zeaxanthin. many lhc genes were down-regulated, with lhcb <dig>  the most strongly repressed . the exceptions were lhcb <dig> , lhcb <dig>  psbs and elips, consistent with data showing that the four corresponding antenna proteins participate in photoprotection  <cit> .

interestingly, the different isoforms of lhcb <dig>  were modulated in distinct ways despite their very similar polypeptide sequence. in particular, although lhcb <dig>  and lhcb <dig>  were down-regulated in both genotypes under stress conditions, lhcb <dig>   <cit>  was induced in both genotypes to the same extent. this is consistent with previous studies showing the evolutionary conservation of genetic redundancy in the lhc superfamily  <cit> , and it suggests that different cp <dig> polypeptides may play significant and specific roles in acclimation.

our expression data also suggested that several signals intersect to regulate the lhc superfamily and that transcriptional regulation is only one component of a more complex process. the most striking change in thylakoid composition under stress was the progressive reduction in the psii/psi ratio, which was more pronounced in npq1lut <dig> mutants . such a reduction may be necessary to prevent the over-reduction of photosynthetic electron chains  <cit>  and likely reflects changes to the rates at which the various substrates are synthesized and destroyed. psii destruction is higher in the mutant because of the excessive photo-oxidation, and we have provided evidence that genes encoding several psii core complex subunits  are induced in the mutant and repressed in wild-type plants . it is well known that the transcription and the translation of psii and psi genes is extremely complex and often uncoupled. analysis of the barley psi-less viridis zb <dig> mutant showed an over-reduction of pq pool and an increase in psii core content into thylakoid with respect to wt ; all these changes in psii content occurs without changes in psaa mrna levels. furthermore, in the viridis zb <dig> mutant, despite the absence of fully assembled psi complex and the missed accumulation of any core polypeptides, all genes encoding psi subunits are substantially expressed at the same level with respect to wild-type plants. these evidences suggest that a) regulation of photosystems accumulation could not only involve chronic pq reduction  <cit>  and b) regulation of composition of photosynthetic components could be mainly at the level of protein turn-over.

in contrast to previous reports  <cit> , the loss of psii content was not accompanied by a dramatic loss of bulk lhcii, probably because more time might be needed to achieve a functional antenna size final state under our growth conditions. finally, 1o <dig> induces chloroplast atp synthase protein i  specifically in npq1lut <dig> mutants after  <dig> h exposure to excess light, and a higher level of atp synthase was previously identified as one of the long-term responses that facilitate chloroplast acclimation to intense light  <cit> .

chloroplasts respond to the accumulation of 1o <dig> by functional reorganization
we found that several genes showing dose-dependent induction by 1o <dig> encoded chloroplast proteins whose function is to protect cells against the damaging effect of ros. most were induced after  <dig> h specifically in the mutant, suggesting induction occurs only when 1o <dig> accumulation exceeds a threshold level .

many of these proteins were thioredoxins, 1o2-quenching proteins that respond to oxidative stress  <cit> . this is consistent with previous reports showing that thioredoxins are protective proteins that maintain the cellular redox environment  <cit> . others are involved in chlorophyll catabolism , and their induction correlates with both the down-regulation of genes involved in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis  and the accelerated reduction of chlorophyll levels in mutant leaves under excess light stress compared to similarly-treated wild type plants. others encode heat shock proteins  and proteases , which function as molecular chaperones that suppress aggregation of proteins damaged by ros, or to facilitate protein turnover . others are involved in either the synthesis or membrane-insertion of photosynthetic subunits, e.g. hcf <dig>  is part of a thylakoid complex essential for the translation of psba mrna , and its induction in a mutant in which higher 1o <dig> accumulation increases the rate of d <dig> turnover is consistent, and alb <dig>  has a role in the insertion of a subset of light-harvesting complexes into thylakoids . the induction of a lipase  and fad <dig>  facilitates the production of jasmonic acid, an elicitor released by chloroplast membranes under photo-oxidative stress. executer <dig>  whose role in coupling 1o <dig> signalling from the chloroplast to nucleus has been described  <cit> , was also up-regulated specifically in mutant plants.

the up-regulation of cia <dig>  in the mutant after  <dig> and  <dig> h of excess light stress is particularly interesting because cia <dig> is a transcription factor that specifically promotes the expression of genes encoding the translocon proteins toc <dig> and toc <dig>  which are necessary for protein import into the chloroplast, and chloroplast ribosomal proteins  <cit> . in addition, both tic <dig>  and tic <dig>  were up-regulated in the mutant, and these encode components of the translocon on the chloroplast inner envelope membrane. taken together, these data suggest that 1o <dig> plays a key role in fulfilling the increased demand for protein import into the chloroplast during photo-oxidative stress, reflecting the higher rate of protein damage and turnover, by co-ordinately up-regulating both protein import and translation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
xanthophylls accumulated within thylakoid membranes are compounds that participate actively to ros scavenging and to the prevention of ros synthesis. our data provide evidences that xanthophylls modulate 1o2-dependent signals during the acclimation to high-light and low-temperature conditions. indeed, in npq1lut <dig> double mutant 1o <dig> signalling facilitates the early fine-tuning of the expression of a group of genes encoding chloroplast proteins. this regulation does not correlate with the redox state of the pq pool. chloroplasts respond to these signals by a significant change in composition, resulting in rapid morphological and functional modifications. the response to 1o <dig> does not include cell death, even in the highly photosensitive npq1lut <dig> mutant.
