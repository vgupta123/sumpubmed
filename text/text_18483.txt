BACKGROUND
grapevine  is one of the oldest  and most important fruit crops in the world  <cit> . today, this species is widely cultivated and represents almost the 98% of grape vineyards subdivided into table, wine and raisin grapes  <cit> . the productivity is generally valuated only by phenotype observation, although it is largely influenced by genotype, environment and cultural techniques. grape was shown to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular and other diseases due to the content of secondary metabolites such as resveratrol, quercetin and others polyphenols  <cit> .

the grapevine genome is diploid and organized in  <dig> chromosomes , with a total size of ~ <dig> mb. a genotype originally derived from the pinot noir grape variety  has recently been sequenced and assembled using a whole-genome shotgun  approach resulting in 12-fold coverage  <cit> .

it was reported that during plant and animal genome evolution, whole-genome and segmental duplication  events occurred leading to an increase in biological complexity and the origin of evolutionary novelties  <cit> . in fact, gene duplication represents the primary source of new gene function origination  <cit> . sds are large blocks of genomic sequence at least  <dig> kb in size mapping to more than one location in a genome. highly similar sds are regions of genome instability as they predispose chromosomes to rearrangements providing templates for non-allelic homologous recombination  events. the erroneous pairing between two non-allelic sds leads, after crossover, to translocation, inversion, deletion or duplication  <cit> . notably in plants, previous studies have reported a large impact of sds on the evolution of genes involved in disease resistance, berry development and the ripening process  <cit> . an example is the nbs-lrr gene family, whose evolution and expansion through duplication have been studied in the arabidopsis thaliana genome  <cit> .

it is widely known that the identification and characterization of high-identity sds is problematic in wgs-based sequencing. the inability to identify such duplications results in the merging of distinct duplicated loci into the same sequence. more divergent duplications with < 94% sequence identity can be easily resolved by the wgs assembly method, whereas high-identity duplications  are frequently collapsed  <cit> . studies about the role of sd in vitis vinifera and other plant genome evolution have followed classical assembly-based approaches of sequence alignment and comparison  <cit> , thus ignoring the impact and contribution of highly similar sds.

the whole-genome shotgun sequence detection  method is a genome-wide approach identifying large , high-identity  sds based on their higher depth of coverage of wgs sequence reads aligned to the reference genome sequence, in an assembly-independent fashion  <cit> . this approach was used to evaluate the genomic architecture of recent sds in human, mouse, chimpanzee, dog and bovine genomes, all species belonging to the mammalian group  <cit> . genome-wide analysis of large, high-identity sds in plant genomes has never been reported. therefore, the extent and organization of highly similar sds in any sequenced plant genome are not known.

in this work, we present an analysis of vitis vinifera pn <dig> inbred line genome architecture and its high-identity duplication content. we generated an sd map for this genome and discovered that  <dig> mb of grapevine genome were duplicated. in this way, we identified duplicated regions that might have been misassembled or erroneously merged in the current genome assembly. we detected  <dig>  genes embedded in the identified duplicated segments, demonstrating a role of duplication in the evolution of these genes. furthermore, the identified genomic regions are candidate hot spots for de novo duplication and/or copy number variation among the wide list of existing grapevine varieties and may underlie the molecular basis of some phenotypical differences among them.

RESULTS
we applied the wssd strategy  <cit>  to the pn <dig> grapevine genome to detect sds  based on a read depth methodology. plant genomes are enriched in repetitive elements, which impose problems in sd detection since large high-copy common repeats may be erroneously classified as sds. to circumvent this issue, we sought to establish the best repeat masking parameters for the grapevine genome. we compared three different settings of the repeatmasker and tandem repeats finder  softwares: i) known repeats with < 10% divergence from the consensus sequence and tandem repeats converted to lowercase, as performed in previous wssd analyses   <cit> ; ii) known repeats without a divergence threshold and tandem repeats converted to lowercase ; and iii) known repeats without a divergence threshold and tandem repeats converted to n . these three methods differ for the stringency of repeat masking  and the possibility of extending the alignment through masked sequence to reach the alignment length threshold .  <dig> % of the vitis genome was masked with a threshold divergence equal to  <dig>  whereas  <dig> % was masked with no divergence threshold. less stringent masking  not only reduces the genomic sequence available for read matches, but also increases the effective size of  <dig> kub  windows, which comprise  <dig> kb of unmasked nucleotides plus the interposed masked ones. in fact, the effective window size depends on the prevalence of masked sequence in the corresponding region.

to experimentally estimate the duplication content in vitis vinifera and establish a control set for wssd analysis, we randomly selected  <dig> bac clones from the pinot noir vvpn <dig> library to use as probes in fish  experiments. we examined hybridization signals on both interphase and metaphase chromosomes to evaluate the single or duplicated nature of the corresponding genomic regions. we based estimations on the observation of at least  <dig> nuclei.

we distinguished signal patterns in single , duplicated , tandem-duplicated , and undefined according to the number and pattern of observed signals . a pattern was assigned as "undefined" when the copy number could not be estimated because of the high background or the pattern was not consistent among the observed nuclei. the results revealed  <dig> single,  <dig> duplicated,  <dig> tandem-duplicated, and  <dig> undefined bacs, whereas  <dig> clones gave no result . all tandem-duplicated clones showed four clusters in both nuclei and metaphases and mapped to two pairs of chromosomes .

end sequences from seventy-nine bac clones were mapped on the grapevine genome assembly, where eight mapped by one end only  . the five tandemly duplicated bac clones were not anchored to the genome assembly. bac end sequences  of these clones were highly similar when aligned to the bes of the other tandemly duplicated clones, except 153c07fm <dig>  with an average identity of  <dig> % . sequence similarities and fish co-hybridization results revealed that all tandem-duplicated bacs hybridize to the same chromosomal region.

of the  <dig> bac clones tagged as single in fish experiments,  <dig> were anchored to the vitis vinifera genome  <cit> . we used the read depth over  <dig> kub windows in these  <dig> bac-anchored loci to define the threshold to detect duplicated  <dig> kub windows for the three different masking settings discussed above. the resulting read depth distributions were similar . after testing some models , we choose to fit the data sample of single bac  <dig> kub window coverages for each masking setting with a model made of four gaussian distributions  . g <dig>  g <dig> and g <dig> curves had an average  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> times the g <dig> average  and a standard deviation √ <dig>  √ <dig> and √ <dig> times the g <dig> standard deviation , respectively. we then considered as single the regions fitting in g <dig> and used the g <dig> average and standard deviation to calculate the threshold values for single and duplicated windows.

we established three categories for  <dig> kub windows based on their wssd coverage or read depth: 1) read depth less than or equal to two sd above the avg ; 2) read depth greater than two sd above the avg and less than or equal to three sd above the avg ; and 3) read depth greater than three sd above the avg  . we calculated the percentages of windows in the whole genome belonging to each category. we first considered all windows together, and then we divided them into five subgroups according to their masked sequence percentage: i) lower than 20%, ii) 20-40%, iii) 40-60%, iv) 60-80%, and v) greater than 80% . we compared the occurrence of negative, borderline and positive windows in the full set and in the five subgroups, observing different distributions. it is noteworthy that for nodiv_low and nodiv_n methods, the higher the masked sequence percentage, the higher the percentage of wssd positive windows. in the case of div10_low method, such a trend is valid for the first three subgroups, with almost half of the windows in the last three subgroups being duplication positive. these results showed that the percentage of wssd positive windows generally increases with the increase of the window masking percentage, when comparing the window subclasses of the same method. this observation is true for all the three methods and is in agreement with previous works that demonstrated the relationship between segmental duplications and repetitive elements  <cit> . moreover, the percentage of all wssd positive windows goes down from  <dig> to  <dig> with decreased masking stringency: converting to n instead of lowercase and not limiting the allowed repeat divergence instead of limiting it to 10%.

we then compared the wssd outputs of fish-single bac clones derived from the three methods . several windows were positive in the div10_low method but negative in the nodiv_low and nodiv_n methods. therefore, reads matching to unmasked repeats, which are more than 10% divergent from the consensus sequence, in the div10_low method widely determined the div10_low higher read depth. we observed a similar result when comparing the nodiv_low and nodiv_n methods because the lowercase repeat masked sequences still allowed matching reads, thus creating a higher depth of coverage. we then considered the nodiv_n method as the most suitable and appropriate masking setting to predict duplicated regions. this setting is better than the other two because it avoids the chance of false positives due to its lower masking stringency, not considering as duplicated the regions particularly rich in common repeats. further, the resultant mean wssd coverage value for windows in single copy  was perfectly consistent with the 12x coverage of the grapevine genome, as  <dig>  ×  <dig>   /  <dig>  =  <dig> . a snapshot of wssd coverages for all vitis vinifera chromosomes is in the additional file  <dig> 

in our subset of  <dig> random clones,  <dig> out of  <dig>  clones classified as duplicated in fish assays contained several wssd positive regions . the remaining five showed one to seven sequence gaps, reflecting the existence of a difficult-to-assemble genomic region, probably due to the presence of duplications. none of the fish-duplicated clones were entirely wssd positive. of the single and undefined clones, 8/ <dig> and 8/ <dig>  respectively, contained at least one wssd positive region. notably, the average number of gaps in the sequence assembly for fish-duplicated clones is almost double the average in fish-single clones , which stresses the difficulties in correctly assembling duplicated regions.

further, we experimentally validated a subset of predicted duplicated regions. we selected  <dig> pn <dig> bac clones mapping to duplicated regions and used them as probes in fish experiments. the results showed that 16/ <dig>  of the bac clones were duplicated, four were single, one showed no result, and one was classified as undefined . bac vv40024h127m <dig> showed a tandem-duplication signal, whereas the others showed an interspersed pattern.

in conclusion, we estimated that sds with > 94% sequence identity and >=  <dig> kb in length comprise  <dig> % of the grapevine genome . we identified  <dig>  duplicated intervals with a size mode equal to  <dig> kb and a maximum size of  <dig> kb .

as expected, contigs assigned to, but not placed on, chromosomes  and contigs unassigned to any chromosome  are enriched for duplicated regions when compared to contigs assembled in chromosomes   . no chromosomes exceed the  <dig> %  of duplicated fraction, except chr16_random . chromosome  <dig> shows the highest value for the percentage of duplicated sequence among the assembled nonrandom chromosomes .

size and percentage of segmentally duplicated regions and the number of duplicated intervals for: each chromosome, all nonrandom chromosomes , all random chromosomes , all nonrandom and random chromosomes , and the whole genome .

the grapevine genome and its duplicated portion are similar in their overall repeat and gc content . of note, sds had a reduction of lines but enrichment in ltr elements, particularly gypsy/dirs <dig> 

we searched for mitochondrial and plastid dna sequences integrated in the grapevine nuclear genome by performing a blast search of the vitis vinifera nuclear genome against vitis vinifera organelle genomes as previously described  <cit> . we found that numts  and nupts  comprise  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, of the grapevine genome . the percentage of numts reduces to  <dig> % when we exclude chromosome "unknown" . the grapevine nuclear genome shows numt content similar to that of arabidopsis thaliana, representing the highest content among those known to date of sequenced plant genomes  <cit> .

interestingly, the grapevine genome and its duplicated portion exhibit different numt and nupt content, either valuating sequences from nonrandom, random, placed or all chromosomes, with a remarkable increase in the percentage of numts in the duplicated segments . we found that 17% and 12% of duplicated intervals contain numts and nupts, respectively.

sds are depleted of genes, with a gene density almost half of the whole genome.  <dig> / <dig>  sds  entirely overlapped  <dig>  predicted genes , whereas  <dig> duplicated intervals  did not contain any partial or entire gene . however, these results may be affected by incomplete gene annotation, especially for sds.

number of total genes , number of fully duplicated genes , chromosome gene density , density of fully duplicated genes in duplicated regions , and ratio between full dup gene density and chr gene density  are shown for each chromosome, all nonrandom chromosomes, all random chromosomes, all nonrandom and random chromosomes, and for the whole genome. gene density is calculated as the average number of genes present in  <dig> kb of genomic sequence.

we searched the interpro domain database to identify the functional motifs contained in vitis vinifera annotated peptides and then compared functional motifs and biological functions between proteins encoded by unique and duplicated genes. we found that  <dig> % of vitis vinifera annotated proteins had no interpro domain assignment, unlike  <dig> % of the subset of proteins codified by genes entirely embedded in duplicated regions . twenty-six interpro domains occurred only in duplicated genes, whereas  <dig> were enriched in duplicated versus single copy genes . most of the  <dig> domains are involved in respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport chains and in biosynthetic processes, such as of terpenoids and vitamin k. among the interpro domains with an enrichment factor greater than or equal to  <dig> , corresponding to the  <dig> most enriched, several take part in translation  or in biosynthetic processes, such as that of fatty acids and phenylpropanoids. in particular, the active sites of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and chalcone/stilbene synthase, key enzymes in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, were enriched in duplicated genes . phenylpropanoids are secondary metabolites important for normal growth and in responses to environmental stress and include flavonoids, stilbenoids, phytoalexins and cell wall components. they provide protection from ultraviolet light, defend against herbivores and pathogens, and mediate plant-pollinator interactions such as floral pigments and scent compounds. other examples of enriched domains are ferritin, which is involved in iron storage, and annexin, present in a family of calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins  <cit>  involved in inhibition of phospholipase activity, exocytosis and endoctyosis, signal transduction, organization of the extracellular matrix, resistance to reactive oxygen species and dna replication  <cit> .

we then analyzed interpro domains contained in the  <dig> most duplicated genes  . several genes among the  <dig> most duplicated contain functional domains with oxidoreductase activity, such as ferrodoxin, enzymes involved in the respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport chains, aldo-keto reductase, glucose/ribitol dehydrogenase, and stearoyl-acyl-carrier-protein desaturase. the cytochrome p <dig> domain, present in a superfamily of heme-containing mono-oxygenases and important in plants for the biosynthesis of several compounds such as hormones, defensive compounds and fatty acids, was frequent. several genes that might be involved in the regulation of transcription are listed: they codify for the set domain, found in hystone lysine methyltransferases  <cit> , or for the homeodomain. genes encoding proteins containing tetratrico peptide repeats, which mediate protein-protein interactions, or pentatrico peptide repeats, which are thought to mediate rna-binding, are also present .

among the  <dig> most duplicated genes,  <dig> detect homologous genes in mitochondria and/or chloroplast genomes. excluding genes in chrun that might contain segments erroneously assigned to the nuclear genome, these data remain valid though less pronounced .

discussion
this is the first genome-wide analysis quantifying duplicated loci and genes as well as mitochondrial and chloroplast dna sequences in the nuclear genome of grapevine. our results have revealed several interesting features of sds and the genome organization in vitis vinifera that were not previously characterized.

this study used a two-pronged approach: molecular cytogenetics and in silico analysis to discern single and duplicated regions in the vitis vinifera genome. the quality of common repeat annotation impacts the assessment of the sd content in a genome. most recent wssd analyses completed on chimpanzee, dog and bovine genomes masked to lowercase repeats having a divergence < 10% from the repeat consensus  <cit>  to more precisely calculate read depth values. our comparison of repeat masking methods revealed that more stringent masking criteria should be avoided in the case of grapevine. we integrated and resolved two limits in the sd analysis: the lack of resolution in detecting small duplications using fish and the existence of highly divergent repetitive elements in the grapevine genome. in this work, we suggest a way to overcome these limits and determine the coverage threshold for duplications, combining the selection of single regions by fish with a statistical analysis of wssd coverage values.

the french-italian public consortium for grapevine genome characterization reports that  <dig> % of the grapevine genome  is composed of repetitive/transposable elements  <cit> . this percentage derives from the integration of different approaches to identify the repetitive elements: the frequency of manually annotated transposable elements is  <dig> %, whereas the frequency of reas derived "repetitive sequences" is  <dig> %, as reported in table s <dig> of the work  <cit> .

we found that  <dig> % of the grapevine genome  is composed of interspersed repeats using the repbase library of vitis repeats . this frequency totally agrees with the one previously reported for the heterozygous grapevine variety   <cit> .

the reas algorithm allows the identification of transposable elements using the unassembled reads of wgs  <cit> , but its results are biased by a 55% of probable artifacts, in part due to the accounting of high copy number sds. since in this work we searched for sds, we preferred to mask the grapevine genome using only manually annotated transposable elements, to avoid the occurrence of high number of false negatives. nevertheless, it should taken into account that our analysis might comprise false positives, due to unannotated transposable elements, that the reas software is able to detect. our choice was driven by the preference of getting some false positive duplications, which are actually transposable elements, instead of losing most real segmental duplications .

we focused on highly similar sds to identify recently duplicated regions in the grapevine genome thus representing candidate hot spots for de novo duplication and/or copy number variation among existing grapevine varieties. according to the remarkable content of highly similar pinot noir sds, we speculate that some of these regions underlie the molecular basis of some phenotypical features, and the copy number variation of genes under investigation should be considered in future studies aimed at the identification of genetic differences among grapevine varieties. a noteworthy observation from our analysis is the high content of organelle dna  as part of pinot noir duplications repertoire suggesting that organelle dna sequence integration, other than sd events, played an important role in grapevine nuclear genome evolution.

two alternative models have been proposed for the evolution of the grapevine genome. they both derive from the primary observation that many regions of the genome appear in triplicate. jaillon et al.  <cit>  suggest that the grapevine genome originated from the contribution of three ancestral genomes . alternatively, velasco et al.  <cit>  suggest a whole-genome duplication event shared by all dicotyledons followed by a large-scale duplication event, likely a hybridization event, in the vitis lineage in close proximity to the vitis speciation event. both these models assume the occurrence of large-scale duplication events during vitis evolution. the duplicative events we tracked in our map are quite recent  and cannot be used to trace any long-range evolutionary history of the vitis genome.

recent genomic sequence data provide substantial evidence for the abundance of duplicated genes in all organisms surveyed  <cit> . many studies have described the involvement of sds in gene evolution. several functional categories are enriched among these genes, including immune response, xenobiotic recognition, reproduction and nuclear functions. this suggests an important role for sds in adaptive evolution: they might have facilitated adaptation to changes especially when a diversity of responses was advantageous  <cit> .

in this study, we characterized which genes have been preferentially duplicated in the grapevine genome, likely giving rise to novel gene families. we performed a genome-wide comparative analysis of functional domains traced in single versus duplicated genes and also focused on the  <dig> most duplicated genes, which revealed two important aspects. first, duplicated genes are enriched for genes without annotated functional domains . second, duplicated genes show some functional biases. a few genes coding for the cytochrome p <dig> domain, found in plant enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of several compounds such as hormones, defensive compounds and fatty acids  <cit> , are among the  <dig> most duplicated. further, the active sites of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and chalcone/stilbene synthase, key enzymes in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, were enriched in duplicated genes. previous grapevine genome sequencing projects already highlighted the existence of several copies of genes encoding these enzymes  <cit> . stilbene synthase catalyzes the synthesis of resveratrol, the major compound responsible of cardioprotective abilities of grapes and wine, attenuating atherosclerosis and ischemic heart  <cit> . additional duplicated genes involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoids and vitamin k have an impact in human health  <cit> . these data suggest a preferential expansion through duplication of genes involved in responses to environmental stress  <cit> . the duplication of these genes might improve not only the plant resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses, but also the nutritional value of grapes and grape products for human consumption. according to our data, in vitis vinifera, like in humans and mammals, most duplicated genes are responsible for adaptation or response to environmental changes and thus are strongly relevant for cultural needs, where the protection of plants from pathogens and climate variability is of great importance. however, since we have not further investigated the fate of the duplicated genes, they could comprise both pseudogenes and novel genes. the analysis of the evolutionary fate of the identified genes and whether they experienced neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization, conservation of function, or nonfunctionalization  <cit>  required further specific and targeted studies on specific gene sequences, at the moment not available. our genome-wide approach has defined an sd map of the grapevine genome and points out sd regions on which to focus future studies aimed at characterizing embedded coding sequences.

the enrichment of interpro domains involved in respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport chains in duplicated vs. unique genes, as well as the role of the highest copy number genes in these two processes, was striking. as these genes are located in nuclear, mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes, their duplication extent may be due to a considerable process of transfer of organellar dna to the nucleus in vitis vinifera, or to the preferential duplication of such sequences in the nuclear genome, after their movement from the organelle genomes.

CONCLUSIONS
the grapevine represents one of the earliest domesticated fruit crops and, since antiquity, has been cultivated for consumption of its fruit or producing wine. genetic information, such as linkage maps, genome-wide association studies, and genome selection, is increasingly being used to guide breeding efforts in grapevines. all of these approaches are focused to isolate varieties showing specific characteristics used for cultural needs but in a time-consuming way. in our genome-wide study, we analyzed and identified candidate regions and genes embedded in sds as possible targets to improve existing grapevine varieties. our sd map represents a useful tool for future comparative studies to other grapevine varieties to identify common or distinctive traits with the aim of selecting the ideal variety for cultural needs. targeted approaches to increase the amount or expression of these genes would be critically important to further improve and use grapes as great source of essential substances for human health.
