BACKGROUND
krüppel-like factor  <dig>  belongs to the klf family of transcription factors, of which there are  <dig> members with diverse biological roles in development and cellular differentiation  <cit> . klfs are characterized by a highly homologous c-terminal dna-binding domain, containing three c2h <dig> zinc fingers that direct binding to caccc boxes and related gc-rich sequences in the control regions of target genes  <cit> . klf <dig> is predominantly a transcriptional repressor which recruits a co-repressor complex containing c-terminal binding protein  to facilitate silencing of its target genes  <cit> . klf <dig> is broadly expressed and has been shown to have roles in several processes, including erythropoiesis  <cit> , adipogenesis  <cit> , muscle cell differentiation  <cit> , and b cell development  <cit> .

the klf <dig> gene is highly expressed in the red blood cell lineage due to the presence of an erythroid specific promoter, which is driven by a related klf, krüppel-like factor  <dig>   <cit> . klf <dig> is a master regulator of erythropoiesis, with functional roles in many facets of erythroid development, including red blood cell structure, heme biosynthesis and globin gene regulation  <cit> . loss of klf <dig> is embryonic lethal, with klf1−/− mice dying in utero from lethal β-thalassemia, due to a failure of activation of β-globin gene expression  <cit> . in addition to regulating the β-globin gene, klf <dig> has been shown to bind the α-globin locus  <cit> , as a component of a complex of factors recruited when looping of enhancer elements to the proximal promoter occurs and initiates high level gene expression  <cit> . loss of klf <dig> leads to reduced α-globin gene expression and chromosome looping  <cit> , although these effects are notably less severe than the down-regulation of β-globin expression, possibly due to functional redundancy between other klf family members and related sp  factors  <cit> . in regulating both the α-globin and β-globin loci, it is probable that klf <dig> contributes to the maintenance of globin chain balance, which is critical for red blood cell function and viability.

given that klf <dig> is required for normal erythropoiesis and is known to repress a subset of klf1-driven target genes  <cit> , we investigated whether klf <dig> can also bind and repress the α-globin gene. in support of this, we found that expression of a gfp reporter transgene, driven by the human α-globin promoter and regulatory elements  <cit>  is significantly up-regulated in klf3−/− mice. furthermore, inspection of the α-globin promoter revealed numerous klf <dig> consensus recognition sites and we confirmed that klf <dig> binds to this region both in vitro in electrophoretic mobility shift assays and in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation. however, despite demonstrating an in vivo interaction of klf <dig> with the α-globin locus, we did not detect de-regulated endogenous α-globin expression in klf3−/− erythroid tissue. in contrast, examination of α-globin mrna levels in klf3−/− murine embryonic fibroblasts revealed a significant increase in expression. in fibroblasts, klf <dig> was found to bind not at α-globin promoter regions, but at the upstream hs- <dig> and hs- <dig> regulatory regions. together, these results suggest that klf <dig> may have a role in the silencing of the α-globin locus in non-erythroid tissue.

RESULTS
klf <dig> regulates expression of a human transgenic α-globin promoter in vivo
to begin our investigation into potential regulation of the α-globin gene by klf <dig>  we made use of an existing well-characterized transgenic mouse model, termed line <dig>  in which a gfp reporter gene is expressed under the control of the human α-globin proximal promoter and hs- <dig> enhancer region  <cit> . the red blood cells of line <dig> mice express gfp and it is possible to accurately measure the level of expression by flow cytometry in either adult peripheral blood or erythroid cells purified from tissues, such as the fetal liver. to determine whether klf <dig> has a role in regulating expression of the reporter gene, we introduced the homozygous transgene into klf3−/− mice  <cit>  by breeding and compared gfp expression in klf3+/+, klf3+/− and klf3−/− erythrocytes.

as previously reported  <cit> , we found that gfp is expressed in line3::klf3+/+erythrocytes with a broad, but consistent and reproducible profile. these cells can be classified as expressing low, intermediate or high levels of gfp . loss of a single allele of klf <dig> had no effect on transgene expression, as we did not find any notable difference between the gfp profiles of line3::klf3+/+and line3::klf3+/− mice . however, analysis of red blood cells from homozygous line3::klf3−/− animals revealed a significant increase in gfp expression . on average, we found that 46% of klf3−/− cells express high levels of gfp, compared to 18% in klf3+/+animals . we also examined newly formed erythrocytes in the erythroid fetal liver. we purified ter119+ cells from the fetal livers of line3::klf3+/+and line3::klf3−/− mice and again observed a significant increase in transgenic promoter activity in the absence of klf <dig> . together, these data suggest that klf <dig> directly or indirectly represses the human transgenic α-globin promoter in this mouse model.

klf <dig> binds the human and mouse α-globin promoters in vitro and in vivo
having determined that klf <dig> influences the expression of a transgene driven by α-globin gene regulatory sequences in vivo, we next investigated whether klf <dig> interacts directly with the α-globin promoter. we inspected the human and mouse α-globin proximal promoters to identify potential high affinity klf <dig> binding sites, which match the klf consensus sequence, 5′-ncn cnc ccn-3′  <cit> . this analysis revealed the presence of several sites, with the human promoter in particular containing  <dig> potential interaction motifs . we then used our sequence analysis to design probes for electrophoretic mobility shift assays  to investigate binding of klf <dig> to the α-globin promoter in vitro. to assess binding to the human promoter, we based our probe on the most frequently seen consensus sequence, 5′-ncc cgc ccn-3′, which occurs four times . in the case of the mouse promoter, where there are noticeably fewer potential klf <dig> binding sites , we used the sequence 5′-nca cgc ccn-3′, which is found twice, to inform our probe design.

we began our investigation into in vitro binding by expressing klf <dig> in cos- <dig> cells and assessing the ability of nuclear extracts purified from these cells to interact with the human and mouse α-globin promoter sequences by emsa. we found that the nuclear extracts bound both human and mouse probes with high affinity and confirmed that this interaction was specific to klf <dig> by supershift with anti-klf <dig> antibody . minimal background binding was observed for nuclear extracts from mock transfected cos- <dig> cells . we next determined whether endogenous klf <dig> present in erythroid cell lines also binds to the human and mouse α-globin promoter probes by preparing nuclear extracts from human k <dig> and murine erythroleukemia  cells. we tested binding of the k <dig> nuclear extracts to the human α-globin probe and the mel nuclear extracts to the mouse probe. again, we found that proteins in both extracts bound to the promoter sequences and confirmed the identity of a klf <dig> complex by supershift with an anti-klf <dig> antibody .

having established that klf <dig> can bind to both the human and mouse α-globin proximal promoters in vitro, we carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays on a number of erythroid cell types to determine whether klf <dig> binds to the α-globin locus in vivo. our approach was to conduct a primer walk across the locus, in which we used taqman real time rt-pcr probes to assess binding at the upstream hs  enhancers, the proximal promoter, the coding sequence, and at a number of control sites, including the α-globin intergenic region, and the β-actin and β-globin genes.

first, we investigated klf <dig> binding to the α-globin locus in uninduced mel cells and found only background binding at each of the sites we examined . however, when we chemically induced erythroid maturation in these cells, we observed a marked enrichment of klf <dig> at the α-globin proximal promoter , consistent with what we have previously reported  <cit> . an examination of mouse primary erythroblasts confirmed that klf <dig> also binds this site in vivo . we then made use of an interspecies hybrid mel cell line into which human chromosome  <dig>  containing the α-globin locus, has been introduced  <cit> . again, we saw only background binding of klf <dig> across the locus in uninduced cells but observed noticeable enrichment at the human α-globin proximal promoter following erythroid maturation . finally, we assessed binding in human primary erythroblasts and once again found high enrichment at the α-globin proximal promoter .

klf <dig> represses α-globin expression in non-erythroid tissue
having confirmed that klf <dig> can bind to the α-globin promoter in vitro and in vivo, we next asked whether loss of klf <dig> results in de-regulation of endogenous α-globin gene expression. we first compared α-globin mrna levels in red blood cells purified from the erythroid fetal liver of klf3+/+, klf3+/− and klf3−/− embryos  by real time qrt-pcr. despite our observation that klf <dig> binds the α-globin gene promoter in vivo, we did not detect any up-regulation of α-globin expression in klf3−/− erythroid cells . in addition, we have previously analyzed the expression of multiple globin genes at an earlier stage of development  and similarly observed no change in adult α-globin transcripts in the absence of klf <dig>  <cit> .

it is possible that in erythroid cells, loss of klf <dig> has little effect because α-globin is expressed at maximal levels. we therefore turned our attention to non-erythroid cells, namely murine embryonic fibroblasts , which express only low levels of α-globin transcripts. in both primary and immortalized mefs lacking klf <dig>  we observed a modest de-repression of α-globin gene expression  . furthermore, stable rescue of klf3−/− mefs with v5-tagged klf <dig> resulted in a significant diminution of α-globin mrna expression .

to explore klf3’s potential mode of regulation at the α-globin locus in non-erythroid cells, we analyzed recently generated klf <dig> chip-seq data from mef cells  <cit> . we found that in these cells, klf <dig> was not bound to the adult α-globin promoters , but showed significant occupancy at the upstream hs- <dig> and hs- <dig> regulatory regions . this contrasted with our observation from a series of erythroid cells , in which klf <dig> was primarily found at the α-globin promoter. analysis of the hs- <dig> region revealed two sites resembling the klf binding consensus via which klf <dig> might be recruited. indeed, emsa experiments confirmed that both of these sites are recognized by both klf <dig> expressed in cos- <dig> cells and endogenous klf <dig> in mefs . taken together, these findings suggest that in non-erythroid cells, klf <dig> binds the hs- <dig> and hs- <dig> regulatory regions and may be involved in repressing and thereby maintain physiologically low levels of α-globin expression in these cells.

lastly, we also analyzed the dna-binding capacity of klf <dig> extracted from erythroid  and non-erythroid  cells . equivalent levels of klf <dig> from these two cellular sources exhibited comparable dna-binding activity at sites in both the murine α-globin promoter and the hs- <dig> regulatory element. this suggests that the differing in vivo occupancy of klf <dig> across the α-globin locus in erythroid and non-erythroid cells  is not due to intrinsic differences in klf3’s ability to bind dna.

discussion
our data show that klf <dig> binds the adult mouse α-globin promoter in erythroid tissue in vivo. however, klf <dig> does not appear to functionally repress the endogenous promoter in red blood cells. similarly, we have previously observed klf <dig> occupancy at the adult β-globin  promoter in erythroid cells and no associated perturbation of hbb-b <dig> transcription upon ablation of klf <dig>  <cit> . it is notable that klf <dig> binding is highest at the late stages of erythroid maturation  when the adult globin genes are expressed at very high levels and their promoters are presumably highly accessible. this is also when klf <dig> levels peak  <cit>  and it is possible that klf <dig> gains access to these regions but is not sufficiently potent to limit klf <dig> driven activation of the genes. this observation highlights the view that transcription factor binding sites discovered by chip may not always have functional relevance in the context in which they are identified, but may instead reflect the dynamic nature of transcription factor binding at permissive loci. indeed, a number of recent chip-seq experiments, performed in association with transcriptome analysis of gene knockout models have revealed that transcription factor binding is not always associated with changes in gene activity  <cit> .

in contrast to the endogenous mouse α-globin promoter, we have shown that klf <dig> does appear to regulate the expression of a human transgenic promoter in erythroid cells. the transgene is driven by a minimal human α-globin promoter and hs- <dig> and perhaps this subset of elements is more reliant on repression by klf <dig> than the entire set of globin regulatory elements. in the case of the endogenous α-globin locus, chromatin conformation capture experiments suggest that gene expression is dependent upon chromosomal looping of distal enhancers to the proximal promoter, in a process that is dependent upon many regulatory factors  <cit> . the removal of such complexity in the transgene most likely offers a far greater opportunity for observing the contribution that single factors make to expression levels. alternatively, it should be noted that the experiments presented here primarily analyzed klf <dig> function in murine cells, and thus it remains possible that klf <dig> may play a role in α-globin regulation in human erythroid cells. indeed, the related factor klf <dig> has been shown to positively regulate the human α-globin promoter in reporter assays and to drive the endogenous hba gene in k <dig> cells  <cit> .

the up-regulation of gfp expression in line3::klf3−/− mice shows that klf <dig> can functionally repress the transgenic α-globin regulatory sequences in vivo, and may function as an epigenetic modifier of transgene expression. klf <dig> mediates repression of its target genes by binding the co-repressor ctbp  <cit> , which in turn recruits a repressive complex that includes several epigenetic modifiers, such as lsd <dig>  g9a, euhmt, pc <dig>  hdac <dig>  and hdac <dig>  <cit> . these factors facilitate histone methylation, demethylation and deacetylation, and are responsible for the addition of repressive epigenetic marks and gene silencing. it is possible that the absence of klf <dig> in line3::klf3−/− erythrocytes prevents ctbp from being recruited to the transgene, and it is this that allows the rewriting of epigenetic marks permissive for transcription, resulting in the up-regulation of gfp expression. indeed, the line <dig> mice have frequently been used in enu mutagenesis screens for modulators of variegated expression, and these screens have predominantly culminated in the identification of epigenetic modifiers, including hdac <dig>  <cit> .

another possible explanation for the lack of de-repression of the endogenous α-globin gene in red blood cells is that the locus is already fully open and maximally expressed, so significant further de-repression cannot occur. in contrast, the transgene contains only a limited subset of regulatory sequences, and may therefore be expressed at lower levels allowing its up-regulation in the absence of klf <dig>  to circumvent this, we examined regulation in murine embryonic fibroblasts, as α-globin mrna expression is limited to low but detectable levels in this cell type. in these non-erythroid cells, we identified a modest but significant increase in α-globin gene expression in the absence of klf <dig>  moreover, in support of a role for ctbp in the regulation of the α-globin locus, we note that another group have observed a similar de-repression  of α-globin gene expression from microarray analysis of ctbp−/− murine embryonic fibroblasts  <cit> .

both the human and mouse α-globin loci lie in an open chromosomal region, surrounded by a number of actively expressed genes and in non-erythroid cells these loci retain the hallmarks of constitutively accessible chromatin  <cit> . this contrasts significantly with the more isolated β-globin gene cluster, where in non-erythroid cells a silent heterochromatic state is established and maintained. it therefore appears that the α-globin locus employs different silencing mechanisms to prevent expression in non-red blood cells. in the case of the human locus, this is achieved by targeted recruitment of the repressive polycomb complex, prc <dig>  to cpg islands in the promoter regions  <cit> . however, these cpg islands have been significantly eroded in the murine α-globin locus  and recruitment of prc <dig> has not been detected, most likely due to loss of polycomb recruitment sites  <cit> . the mechanism of α-globin gene silencing in non-erythroid tissue in the mouse therefore remains unclear. here we suggest that klf <dig> participates in this silencing and may do so not through direct interaction with the α-globin proximal promoter but via distal regulatory regions such as hs- <dig>  in erythroid cells, hs- <dig> is an enhancer element that loops to the α-globin promoter and is required for appropriate regulation of expression  <cit> . in non-erythroid cells, such looping is disrupted and occurs at a much lesser frequency  <cit> . whilst these observations allude to the functional importance of the hs- <dig> element, it should be noted that loss of hs- <dig> only modestly deregulates α-globin expression in erythroid cells and has not been reported to perturb non-erythroid silencing  <cit> . thus it is likely that correct tissue-specific control of the locus is achieved by a complex interplay between multiple cis-acting regulatory regions and positively- and negatively-acting trans factors such as klf <dig> and klf <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
excessive α-globin expression can be detrimental to cells and thus it is important that mechanisms exist to limit its expression. collectively, the findings presented here suggest that the broadly expressed transcriptional repressor klf <dig> may have a role in silencing the α-globin locus in some but not all contexts, and in particular in non-erythroid tissues. these results complement the previous observation that the klf <dig> co-repressor ctbp is also required for the appropriate control of α-globin expression in non-erythroid cells  <cit> .
