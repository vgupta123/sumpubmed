BACKGROUND
shewanella is a genus of facultatively anaerobic, gram-negative aquatic bacteria found in diverse environments around the globe  <cit> . this ecological diversity is enabled by their highly adaptable metabolism for which they have a diverse respiratory system, capable of reducing up to  <dig> different organic and inorganic compounds  <cit> . in addition, their carbon usage is quite varied, mainly comprising two- and three-carbon fermentation products, amino acids, and sugars  <cit> . shewanella are of particular interest today because of their possible use in bioremediation in which the organisms convert a wide variety of metals from a soluble to an insoluble form and thus prevent the spread of contamination  <cit> . for example, shewanella putrefaciens has been shown to reduce soluble uranium-vi to insoluble uranium-iv  <cit> . shewanella strains can also degrade halogenated organics, including polychlorinated biphenyls and possibly explosive nitramines  <cit> . shewanella strains have also been metabolically engineered for chemical production  <cit> .

currently, there are over  <dig> sequenced strains of shewanella. these genomic datasets provide insight into both the cumulative  and conserved  capabilities of this species. previous studies have used these sequenced genomes to study metabolic subsystems  <cit>  and regulons  <cit>  in shewanella strains. another recent study looked at the carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous and sulfur utilization capabilities of five different shewanella strains and reconciled these with genomic data  <cit> .

metabolic modeling provides a way to integrate the wide variety of data available on the shewanella, from both traditional microbiology and high-throughput “-omics”  experiments. in addition, genome-scale metabolic models provide a systematic way to assess the metabolic potential of an organism  <cit> . with genome sequences available for more than  <dig> shewanella strains  <cit> , models can be used to improve our understanding of metabolism in the shewanella genus as a whole  <cit> , which will allow model-based predictions of the behavior of unstudied strains.

the genome-scale metabolic model of shewanella oneidensis mr- <dig> published in  <dig>  has been used as a platform to integrate and validate experimental data with computational predictions  <cit> . this model also provides a platform to develop other genome-scale metabolic models for other shewanella strains. in this study, we have expanded the previous model for mr- <dig> based on updated genome annotations and compared model growth predictions to fitness measurements for transposon-tagged mutants  <cit> . we subsequently used the updated model  together with genome comparisons  and experimental data to develop the genome-scale metabolic models for three other shewanella strains, shewanella sp. mr- <dig> , shewanella sp. w3-18- <dig> , and shewanella denitrificans os <dig> . in addition, we developed a shewanella core  model using genome annotations of  <dig> sequenced shewanella strains that would represent the conserved metabolic functionalities of all shewanella strains. furthermore, we used the developed models to predict and compare the metabolic capabilities of shewanella strains in utilizing various carbon and electron acceptor sources. we also used a previously developed computational algorithm, comparison of networks by gene alignment   <cit>  to identify functional differences between the developed metabolic networks, which helps reveal unique metabolic and genetic differences in each shewanella strain.

methods
strains and media
shewanella oneidensis mr- <dig> was obtained from grigoriy pinchuk , shewanella sp. mr- <dig> and shewanella sp. w3-18- <dig> were obtained from daad saffarini . shewanella denitrificans os <dig> was obtained from the american type culture collection . strains were cultivated at 30°c in luria broth  , half-strength difco marine broth  or modified m <dig> medium  <cit> . for growth phenotype experiments modified m <dig> medium was supplemented with various carbon sources at 40 mm concentration.

growth phenotype experiments
for growth rate experiments, strains were precultured overnight in 2 ml lb or marine broth at 30°c with continuous shaking. cells were then transferred into 2 ml of modified m <dig> supplemented with the carbon source of interest at 20 mm concentration and 20 mm d, l-lactate  or 20 mm maltose  using a 1: <dig> dilution from the overnight lb or marine broth culture and grown for 24 hours  or 48 hours  at 30°c. the cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm and resuspended in modified m <dig> medium containing no carbon source to an od <dig> of 1– <dig> . 5 μl of the cell suspension was then added to 95 μl of modified m <dig> medium supplemented with the carbon source of interest on a 96-well plate.

growth/no-growth phenotype tests were performed using the same procedure, with the second preculture containing only lactate or maltose at 40 mm concentration. after harvesting, the cells were washed with 1 ml of modified m <dig> medium to remove any residual carbon source, centrifuged again, and resuspended. growth curve experiments were conducted in a tecan infinite m <dig> plate reader . cultures were grown at 30°c in  <dig> well plates with od <dig> readings taken every 15 minutes. growth rates  were calculated from the linear fit of ln versus time, where the slope corresponds to the growth rate. biomass yields  were calculated by subtracting the starting od from the stationary phase od and dividing by the starting concentration of the carbon substrate. results are provided in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

identification of orthologs
a table with the draft ortholog predictions among the  <dig> sequenced shewanella strains was constructed using inparanoid as previously described  <cit> . this table was subjected to extensive manual curation to improve the prediction of ortholog group membership. gene synteny among the shewanella strains made it possible to readily identify orthologous groups that had missing members or that contained extra or erroneously grouped members . missing group members were identified by tblastn analysis  or blastp analysis . insertion elements were mapped in each of the genomes as described for s. oneidensis mr- <dig>  <cit>  to assist in identification of gene fragments; these “pseudogenes”  were also added  to the ortholog table. comparison of domain content and predicted subcellular location among group members were then used to refine group membership as previously described  <cit> . the ortholog table is presented in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

model reconstruction of the five shewanella models including the core
the shewanella models imr4_ <dig>  iw3181_ <dig>  and ios217_ <dig> developed in this study were constructed manually using the imr1_ <dig> as a template, and the gene-protein-reaction  associations in each new model were constructed based on the ortholog table. reactions in the imr1_ <dig> metabolic model were copied to the metabolic models of these strains if the associated mr- <dig> genes had orthologs in the other strains or if no genes were associated to the reaction in imr1_ <dig>  genes that did not have orthologs in these strains and their associated reactions were removed from the base imr1_ <dig> model to obtain draft models that were specific to imr4_ <dig>  iw3181_ <dig>  and ios217_ <dig>  flux balance analysis   <cit>  was then used to predict growth of these draft models upon removing reactions from the base model. if the deleted reaction prevented growth in the model that conflicted with experimental data, genes  with similar functions identified in the genome annotation were added to the constructed model. furthermore, metabolic genes that are unique and specific to each strain and their associated reactions were added into the models. the biomass and lipopolysaccharide  reactions were updated if necessary to reflect the physiology of the organism. for example, the lps reaction for iw3181_ <dig>  ios217_ <dig>  and core was modified because unlike imr1_ <dig>  they are not capable of producing udp-n-acetyl-d-galactosamine. the lps reaction for imr4_ <dig> was updated based on the structure determined experimentally by vinogradov et al.  <cit> .

the core model was constructed based on the genes that were conserved across all  <dig> sequenced shewanella strains. non-gpr reactions were added to the model only if they were predicted to be essential for aerobic growth on pyruvate, resulting in a smaller number of reactions without gpr associations . furthermore, there are four essential reactions in the core model with gprs that include genes that are not conserved across all  <dig> shewanella strains. for example, the first reaction glutamate-5-semialdehyde dehydrogenase  converts l-glutamate 5-phosphate  to l-glutamate 5-semialdehyde . every shewanella strain studied has a proa enzyme that catalyzes the g5sd reaction; however, there are two different orthologs that encode the proa enzyme, and some strains have only one of the two. since the core model represents the collective group and g5sd is an essential reaction , the two genes associated with proa were encoded as isozymes in the core model. the other three reactions are acetylornithine deacetylase , inorganic diphosphatase , and a sulfate transport reaction .

evaluation of mutant fitness data
the mutant fitness data set from deutschbauer et al.  <cit>  contains fitness scores for  <dig>  knockout mutants for each of the  <dig> pool fitness experiments . a fitness score of − <dig>  was used as a cutoff to distinguish mutants that grew or did not grow. this cutoff results in a similar percentage of viable mutants  which were unable to grow in different conditions  as found in a previous study with escherichia coli   <cit> . in addition, deutschbauer et al. individually tested  <dig> mutants, and found that those with a fitness score less than − <dig>  had growth rates 60% lower than the wild type  or had long lag phases . based on these results, we set the cutoff for growth based on fitness scores to be − <dig>  . if there are multiple experiments for the same simulated condition , then the mutant will be assigned as growth if the majority of similar experiments have z-scores above the cutoff, or no growth if the majority of similar experiments have z-scores below the cutoff. however, if there are equal numbers of entries with z-scores above and below the cutoff, then the growth of the mutant is deemed undetermined. these undetermined cases were not considered when calculating the accuracy, false positive, and false negative prediction rates of the models.

only experiments from the “carbon source”, “nitrogen source”, “carbon and nitrogen source”, and the “anaerobic” groups where considered. experiments from the remaining groups were not considered because they cannot be simulated using the models. next, experiments that are labeled as stationary phase, saturated, or with added cas amino acids were excluded from our analysis. in total, we were able to make  <dig>  predictions for  <dig> of the  <dig>  knockout mutants  under  <dig> unique simulation conditions for the imr1_ <dig> model. the  <dig> simulation conditions can be mapped to  <dig> of the  <dig> fitness experiments . additional file 2: table s <dig> contains a list of the  <dig> different simulation conditions and what sets of experimental data were used to compare predictions to.

model-predicted growth phenotypes on different carbon sources and electron acceptors
fba  <cit>  was used to predict growth by different shewanella models  on different carbon sources and electron acceptors . briefly, for each carbon source and electron acceptor tested, flux through the biomass reaction was maximized. the exchange fluxes for a particular carbon source and electron acceptor were constrained to have lower bounds of −10 mmol/g afdw/h . in all simulations, the lower bounds on the exchange fluxes for phosphate, sulfate, water, proton, and ammonia  were set to −1000 mmol/g afdw/h. the upper bound on all exchange fluxes was 1000 mmol/g afdw/h so that any extracellular compound could be secreted. growth- and non-growth-associated atp requirements were set to zero for all model simulations since these values are unknown for the other strains. the sets of carbon sources and electron acceptors that were tested in the simulations were the union sets of carbon sources and electron acceptors from the five metabolic models. all models used the same exchange flux constraints.

cluster analysis
a hierarchical clustering approach was used to gain an understanding of how the four shewanella models relate to each other under different conditions. a heat map was generated and used to create a dendrogram using the “clustergram” function in matlab. clustergram takes in an input matrix of interest and generates a dendrogram based on a specified distance metric. the default ‘euclidean’ distance metric was used in this analysis. the height of each branch represents the distance between the two data points that are connected. the heat maps were generated using binary matrices indicating whether a metabolic gene is present  or absent  in a particular model or whether the model was predicted to grow  or not  under a given growth condition.

network comparison using conga
conga, or comparison of networks by gene alignment  <cit> , is a constraint-based method that can be used to identify how differences in reaction content or gpr associations give rise to differences in growth predictions between models by comparing reconstructed networks aligned at the gene level. the method identifies gene deletion strategies that lead to different optimal flux distributions in a pair of networks. specifically, conga identifies a set of orthologous genes to delete such that the flux difference in a reaction of interest  between the two models is maximized. the set of orthologs deleted by conga are referred to as a gene deletion set. in this paper, we were interested in the gene deletion sets that when knocked out from both organisms would leave only one capable of growth, and so we chose to maximize the difference in flux through the biomass reaction. please refer to the original paper on conga for additional algorithm details  <cit> .

RESULTS
development of five shewanella models including the core
compared to the original model for mr- <dig>   <cit>  our updated model  contains additional reactions involved in alternate carbon metabolism , cell envelope biosynthesis , energy metabolism , glycolysis/gluconeogenesis , methionine metabolism , nucleotide salvage pathways , valine, leucine, and isoleucine metabolism , and additional transport reactions . to evaluate the performance of the original and updated mr- <dig> models, we compared model predictions to a recent study reporting wildtype and mutant phenotypes  <cit> . of the  <dig> experiments evaluated in the original study, we were able to map  <dig> experiments to  <dig> different simulatable conditions that imr1_ <dig> predicted could support growth . the iso <dig> model could only predict growth for the wildtype strain in  <dig> of these  <dig> conditions, indicating that  <dig> conditions are incorrectly predicted by the original model. when evaluating the growth phenotypes for the subset of mutants  and conditions  that both models could make predictions for, we found the iso <dig> model had an overall accuracy of  <dig> % and the imr1_ <dig> model had an overall accuracy of  <dig> %. this was done assuming that mutants with a fitness score less than − <dig>  did not grow . we next evaluated the sensitivity of the imr1_ <dig> model’s accuracy to the fitness cutoff used to indicate growth or no growth phenotypes  using all mutants  and conditions  that could be simulated by imr1_ <dig>  a summary of the  <dig> mutants that the imr1_ <dig> failed to predict correctly in at least half of the conditions is provided in additional file 2: table s <dig> along with possible reasons for model-data discrepancies.

the updated imr1_ <dig> was used as a starting point to generate models for three additional strains. several alternative carbon metabolism pathways were added to the shewanella models based on literature data  <cit>  and our experimental observations. for example, three shewanella strains  were shown to be able to use arabinose as a carbon source under aerobic conditions . although only imr4_ <dig> and iw3181_ <dig> have the genes associated with arabinose catabolism, the reactions were also added to ios217_ <dig> without gpr associations. this accounts for why the number of reactions without gpr across the four models is different even though they all carried over the non-gpr reactions from imr1_ <dig> .

as shown in table  <dig>  the total number of reactions in the ios217_ <dig> model is much lower than the other three models because ios217_ <dig> has the most number of deleted reactions from the imr1_ <dig> model . to better compare content between the four models, we generated 4-way venn diagrams to show the number of reactions and genes that are shared or are unique between each model. all four models share  <dig> reactions  . furthermore, imr1_ <dig>  imr4_ <dig>  and iw3181_ <dig> share  <dig> reactions that are absent in ios217_ <dig>  it should be noted that ios217_ <dig> appears to be the most distinct among these  <dig> models since it has the most number of unique reactions and shares the least number of reactions with the other models. a similar pattern was found with the number of orthologs shared among the  <dig> models . all four models share  <dig> metabolic genes. again, ios217_ <dig> appears to be the most distinct strain based on the high number of unique genes and the low number of shared genes with the other models.

athe two unique reactions in the core model with not in imr1_ <dig> are the lipopolysaccharide synthesis reaction and the biomass reaction.

bthe four genes in the core model that are not in imr1_ <dig> are defined as isozymes for the glutamate-5-semialdehyde dehydrogenase , acetylornithine deacetylase , inorganic diphosphatase , and sulfate transport  reactions since some shewanella strains have different non-orthologous genes that catalyze these reactions.

the core model was built to provide a representation of the shewanella genus by only including the reactions and genes that are conserved across the  <dig> sequenced strains and a few additional essential reactions . only  <dig> essential reactions without gpr associations were kept in the core model to better represent a minimal model of the shewanella genus, of which  <dig> of these  <dig> reactions do not have gpr associations in any of the models. the remaining four non-gpr core reactions point towards gaps in our knowledge for some of the  <dig> shewanella strains. the  <dig> reactions and  <dig> genes in the core model turned out to represent an average of 73% and 72% of the reactions and genes of the  <dig> shewanella models developed here, respectively . this means that on average, the remaining 27% of the reactions and 28% of the genes are responsible for extra metabolic capabilities specific to each strain. this is comparable to the percentage of genes in the core e. coli model developed by monk et al.  <cit>  out of  <dig> e. coli models .

by comparing the wildtype version of each of these five models, we are able to identify how each model and thus strain is physiologically different from the entire shewanella genus. in addition, by comparing knockout predictions across the five models, we are able to identify deeper genetic and metabolic differences for each strain. we explore these two levels of comparison in the following sections.

model-predicted growth phenotypes on different carbon sources and electron acceptors
the reconstructed metabolic models of different shewanella strains, imr1_ <dig>  imr4_ <dig>  iw3181_ <dig>  ios217_ <dig>  and the core model were used to predict growth capabilities of each strain on different carbon sources and electron acceptors. a total of  <dig> carbon sources and  <dig> electron acceptors were used in the fba simulations . among these  <dig>  pairs of carbon sources and electron acceptors, there were  <dig> pairs that have been verified experimentally to support growth of mr- <dig>  <cit> . comparing only the aerobic cases, we found that our models correctly predicted  <dig> out of  <dig> carbon sources for imr1_ <dig> , 31/ <dig> for imr4_ <dig> , and 25/ <dig> for iw3181_ <dig>  when compared against experimental data  <cit> , including some generated in this study . note that whenever there was a conflict between the experimental results, we assumed that the high-throughput methods were less accurate. some of the inaccurately predicted cases were for compounds that were shown experimentally to serve as sole nitrogen sources . based on the nitrogen source results, the pathways to metabolize those compounds should be in the models, which allow the models to also predict their utilization as carbon sources. however, the fact that those compounds were shown to be used as sole nitrogen sources and not sole carbon sources suggests that there might be regulatory limitations within the strains that prevent them from using those compounds as sole carbon sources.

for a particular pair of carbon source and electron acceptor, growth phenotypes were qualitatively classified as growth if the model predicted growth rate is positive and no growth if the predicted growth rate is zero. the number on the heat map indicates the number of shewanella strains that were predicted to grow on the corresponding carbon source and electron acceptor . as expected, under aerobic conditions  most models  were predicted to grow with a variety of carbon sources . there were at most three models that were predicted to be able to grow using organic electron acceptors while most models were predicted to use inorganic electron acceptors . fumarate was predicted to be the organic electron acceptor that can be used in combination with a majority of carbon sources to enable in silico growth. while the number of models that were predicted to grow on different electron acceptors varied greatly with different amino acids and small carbon compounds, it was quite consistent across nucleotides, sugars, and fatty acids. this indicated that the enzymes or pathways that utilize these latter carbon sources were the same in each strain, or the strain had enzymes that convert one carbon source to another.

cluster analysis of the reconstructed models
to evaluate how each model relates to the others based on the presented results so far, heat maps and dendrograms were created for the four models based on metabolic gene content or phenotype predictions . first, a heat map and dendrogram was generated based on the presence or absence of metabolic genes in the metabolic models . from this analysis, imr4_ <dig> and iw3181_ <dig> were found to be the most similar, followed by imr1_ <dig> on the left and ios217_ <dig> on the right of the first pair, indicating that imr1_ <dig> and ios217_ <dig> are the most different. additional analysis revealed that the orders between imr1_ <dig>  imr4_ <dig>  and iw3181_ <dig> can switch with just a few changes in the genes considered due to the small differences in the dendrogram branch heights. next, a heat map and dendrogram was generated based on predicted growth phenotypes on the different carbon sources and electron acceptors . this time, while ios217_ <dig> is still the most distinct strain, imr1_ <dig> is more similar to iw3181_ <dig> than imr4_ <dig> in the dendrogram . this result suggests that while imr4_ <dig> and iw3181_ <dig> have highly similar metabolic gene content, the genes deleted from imr1_ <dig> and those added to imr4_ <dig> and iw3181_ <dig> resulted in imr1_ <dig> and iw3181_ <dig> being more metabolically similar from a network perspective.

multi-model network comparison using conga
conga is a constraint-based method that can be used to identify functional differences between two models by comparing reconstructed networks aligned at the gene level. we used conga to identify orthologous genes to delete such that only one of the two organisms being compared is capable of growth. in this work, we identified three reasons that explain the functional differences found by conga: metabolic , genetic , and biomass differences .

a summary of the conga results for the single gene deletion cases under three different media conditions can be found in figure  <dig>  to simplify the presentation, we combined all the pair-wise conga results to show the total number of unique lethal genes identified by conga for each model . for example, for the aerobic pyruvate condition, we can see that there are  <dig> genes that are only essential in imr1_ <dig> but not in at least one of the other  <dig> models . there are cases where the deletion of one gene may be due to both genetic and metabolic differences depending on which models it is being compared to. for example, the deletion of mr4_ <dig> is lethal in imr4_ <dig> but the deletion of the orthologous imr1_ <dig> gene is not because imr1_ <dig> has two isozymes for the same reaction, thus, a genetic difference. on the other hand, the deletion of mr4_ <dig> is picked up by conga as being lethal in imr4_ <dig> and non-lethal in the core model due to a biomass difference. analysis for the double deletion cases can be found in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  original pairwise growth/no-growth conga results can be reconstructed using additional file 2: tables s <dig> and s <dig> 

based on this analysis, we can clearly see that under the aerobic condition, the core model is the least robust since the core model has the least number of genes and reactions. thus, the core model has fewer isozymes  and alternative pathways to compensate for deleted genes. imr1_ <dig>  imr4_ <dig>  iw3181_ <dig>  and ios217_ <dig> have comparable robustness under this condition. however, under the l-alanine plus nitrate condition, ios217_ <dig> appears to be the most robust model. the robustness of imr1_ <dig> and imr4_ <dig> is actually comparable in this latter case but imr1_ <dig> appears to have a higher number of lethal genes because some of the reactions involved have many subunits. thus, the same reaction is picked up by conga multiple times because deletion of any of the subunits produced the same results. for example, four of the genetic difference entries were all due to imr1_ <dig> not having a 4-subunit isozyme for the nitrate reductase reactions ntr <dig> and ntr <dig> which is present in both imr4_ <dig> and iw3181_ <dig>  therefore, deletion of each of the four subunits results in a gene deletion set where imr1_ <dig> is lethal but not imr4_ <dig> or iw3181_ <dig> under l-alanine plus nitrate conditions. finally, imr1_ <dig>  imr4_ <dig>  and iw3181_ <dig> have relatively similar robustness under d-lactate plus iron  conditions. the total number of lethal genes is lower in this condition because only three models were analyzed. the ios217_ <dig> and core models were excluded from the last condition because they are not capable of growth under that condition.

furthermore, we mapped the reactions associated with the genes in the gene deletion sets to their respective metabolic subsystems to see if a specific subsystem was responsible for most of the differences identified by conga for the single deletion case. of all subsystems, the energy metabolism subsystem stood out with the most number of reactions associated with orthologs deleted by conga  and they all appear only under l-alanine plus nitrate conditions. further investigation shows that all  <dig> reactions involve the gene associated with the membrane-anchored tetraheme cytochrome c, cyma. deletion of cyma is lethal in imr1_ <dig> and not in imr4_ <dig> and iw3181_ <dig> because the latter two models have alternative enzymes that do not require cyma for nitrate reductase activity.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have shown an extensive comparison of four different shewanella strains, mr- <dig>  mr- <dig>  w3-18- <dig>  and os <dig> in terms of growth phenotypes using integrated approaches of genome comparisons, experiments, and computational models. based on conservation of metabolic gene content, we expected that imr4_ <dig> and iw3181_ <dig> to be the most similar, with imr1_ <dig> and ios217_ <dig> being the most different. however, our results revealed that based on predicted growth phenotypes mr- <dig> is most similar to w3-18- <dig>  followed by mr- <dig> and os <dig> in terms of metabolic capabilities in using various carbon and electron acceptor sources. this suggested that genetic similarity does not always coincide with metabolic phenotype similarity. some conflicts between our models’ predictions and experimental data suggest there may be regulatory effects affecting cellular phenotypes that are not accounted by our models. regulons for  <dig> transcription factors have been predicted based on comparative genomic analysis of  <dig> shewanella strains and they also appear to highly vary across the different strains  <cit> . together the metabolic and regulatory networks help shape the diversity of this species.

the core model reflects the conserved metabolic capabilities of all sequenced strains. based on analysis of the core model, it appears that all strains appear to be capable of using pyruvate, amino acids , and fatty acids as sole carbon sources. interestingly, only oxygen was predicted to be used as an electron acceptor by the core model, indicating that while many strains can use other electron acceptors, the respiratory pathways and enzymes involved are not necessarily conserved.

we also used computational approaches to further investigate the metabolic and genetic differences among these strains under several common growth conditions. our computational analyses provided more insights into the metabolic capabilities of each shewanella strain of interest. each genome-scale metabolic model developed in this work will serve as a platform to integrate experimental data with computational approaches for each shewanella strain, which would be helpful to researchers who study shewanella for scientific discovery, bioremediation, or metabolic engineering applications. in addition, the shewanella core model will serve as a base model to develop genome-scale models for other shewanella strains by simply adding metabolic functionalities that are unique to those individual strains.
