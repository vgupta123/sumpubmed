BACKGROUND
restriction enzymes represent a group of sequence-specific endonucleases that cleave dna of a specific epigenetic modification state  <cit> , resulting in defense against selfish genetic elements, such as viruses  and plasmids. a restriction enzyme  gene is usually linked with a modification enzyme  gene that recognizes the same target sequence and methylates it to prevent cleavage of dna by the restriction enzyme. several studies have reported that some restriction-modification  systems are also selfish genetic elements, killing cells that have lost them through chromosome cleavage  <cit> . such post-segregational killing is commonly observed with rm systems classified as ‘type ii’. bioinformatics, molecular evolutionary analyses and laboratory experiments have validated their behavior as mobile genetic elements that insert into and rearrange genomes.

a type ii restriction enzyme, r.pabi  <cit>  exhibiting a “half-pipe” fold  <cit> , has been identified as a dna glycosylase that excises the adenine base from its recognition sequence, gtac, when not methylated at this site to generate an apurinic/apyrimidinic  site  <cit> . r.pabi has also been shown to exert ap lyase activity  <cit> . until these findings, all restriction enzymes examined had been identified as dna phosphodiesterases  <cit> . despite different ternary structures, all these enzymes cleave the sugar-phosphate backbone of dna, leaving 5’-phosphate and 3’-oh ends. the ap lyase activity of r.pabi generates a different terminal structure, 5’-phosphate and 3’-phospho alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde  ends  <cit> , which are difficult to re-ligate via dna ligase. these results led to the reclassification of restriction enzymes into restriction phosphodiesterase and glycosylase subgroups  <cit> .

r.pabi was originally identified from a hyperthermophilic archaeon pyrococcus abyssi during genome comparison with pyrococcus horikoshii  <cit> . a region including the r.pabi gene and the neighboring methyltransferase gene encoding a dna methyltransferase, m.pabi, is present in the genome of p. abyssi, but absent at the orthologous locus in the genome of p. horikoshii  <cit> , which contains an 18 kb sequence instead  <cit> . homologs of r.pabi have been detected in various archaea and bacteria, with particular abundance in epsilonproteobacteria, such as helicobacter pylori  <cit> . the r.pabi homolog in h. pylori, termed r.hpyaxii, is reported to be a gtac-specific restriction enzyme  <cit> . the neighboring gene encodes m.hpyaxii, an adenine methyltransferase. these findings have led to the proposal that r.pabi and m.pabi homolog pairs constitute an rm system targeting gtac tetranucleotides. however, systematic evolutionary analysis of the r.pabi and m.pabi homologs has not been performed to date.

h. pylori, a gram-negative pathogenic bacterium colonizing the stomach, is associated with several gastrointestinal disorders  <cit> . h. pylori is highly divergent in genome sequences within the species  <cit> . due to stable transmission from parents to children, the lineages of h. pylori maintain traces of human migration. this characteristic was used to reveal human migration to the americas and pacific islands  <cit> . at present, based on the sequences of seven conserved genes, h. pylori is classified into several populations , each with a distinct geographical distribution  <cit> . these are further grouped into subpopulations. for example, hpeastasia is subdivided into hspeasia, hspmaori, and hspamerind, consistent with the east asian origin of amerind  people  <cit> . among these, hspeasia and hspamerind are further divided into subgroups  <cit> .

in the current study, systematic examination revealed clear evidence of co-insertion of r.pabi and m.pabi homolog genes. r.pabi and m.pabi homologs in various strains of h. pylori and related species, h. acinonychis and h. cetorum, were orthologous, signifying insertion in the common ancestor. two examples of cross-genus presence of r.pabi and m.pabi pair at the orthologous locus are also found. moreover, we showed the geographic and phylogenetic distribution of the hrgc gene replacing r.pabi and m.pabi homolog genes in h. pylori, and discussed its implications in human migration.

RESULTS
co-occurrence of r.pabi and m.pabi homologs
r.pabi homologs have been identified from various species of archaea and bacteria  <cit> . our extensive psi-blast search led to the identification of several homologs from various species. r.pabi homologs were identified for the first time for brachyspira sp., mycoplasma primatum, mucispirillum schaedleri, as well as several species from the genera campylobacter and helicobacter . analysis of the gene neighborhood of r.pabi homologs showed that almost all r.pabi homologs are next to an adenine methyltransferase gene , as reported for p. abyssi and h. pylori  <cit> .

phylogenetic trees were compared based on r.pabi homologs and neighboring methyltransferase genes . due to frequent disruption in r.pabi homologs, compared to that in neighboring methyltransferase genes, fig. 1a includes fewer sequences than fig. 1b. hereafter, these methyltransferase genes are designated ‘m.pabi homologs’. blastp search with m.pabi as a query led to the identification of several homologous protein sequences that are not associated with r.pabi homologs . using an m.pabi homolog from h. pylori as a query, blastp hits were mainly proteins associated with r.pabi homologs, and archaeal m.pabi homologs from acidilobus and pyrococcus were hit with e-values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. both archaeal and bacterial m.pabi homologs are gamma-type methyltransferases containing a target recognition domain  at the c-terminus. bacterial m.pabi homologs are shorter than their archaeal counterparts due to the shorter c-terminal regions.fig.  <dig> phylogeny of r.pabi and m.pabi homologs. trees are rooted at the midpoint. bootstrap values of  <dig> replicates over 50 % are shown at the nodes. archaeal sequences are colored in green, helicobacter sequences in red and campylobacter sequences in blue. a tree of r.pabi homologs. four orthologous loci  are indicated on the right. the order of r.pabi and m.pabi homolog genes is illustrated on the far right. b tree of m.pabi homologs. loci are indicated on the right: h- <dig> to h- <dig> for helicobacter and c- <dig> to c- <dig> for campylobacter. neighboring genes for each locus are shown in table 1




both trees showed two lineages nearly corresponding to archaea and bacteria. two closely related epsilonproteobacteria genera, campylobacter and helicobacter, contained almost all the bacterial pabi homologs. it is likely that pabi homologs in mucispirillum schaedleri  and brachyspira sp.  were horizontally transferred from epsilonproteobacteria. the position of caloramator  was not consistent between the phylogenies of m.pabi and r.pabi homologs, and may represent another lineage distant from archaeal and bacterial lineages or recombination of r.pabi of one subfamily and m.pabi of another .

the gene order in the pabi family of rm systems corresponded to the phylogeny of m.pabi and r.pabi homologs. the archaeal lineage contained the m and r genes in a tail-to-tail orientation, while the bacterial lineage contained the m gene upstream of the r gene in the same orientation. this finding raises the possibility that archaeal and bacterial m.pabi homologs are not orthologous, and represent two lineages independently paired with r.pabi homologs.

m.pabi and r.pabi homologs at orthologous sites shared by species
comparison of helicobacter and campylobacter genomes revealed at least  <dig>  and  <dig>  loci for the pabi family of rm systems . some of these loci are shared by different species  or genera  as detailed below. to confirm the orthology of these cross-species/genera rm systems, we aligned the spacer sequences between the upstream gene and the m gene , and found that they are very likely orthologous. campylobacter upsaliensis rm  <dig> has an m.pabi homolog similar to m.pabi homologs at the h- <dig> locus in helicobacter . it was revealed to have been transferred horizontally from helicobacter and thus we included this m.pabi homolog in the h- <dig> lineage even though it was from campylobacter. the details are described in the next section.table  <dig> loci for the pabi family of rm systems in helicobacter and campylobacter

the closest genes that are not components of rm system are shown. in cases of more than two gene arrangements in the same group, two genes are shown, divided by a slash . h- <dig> to h- <dig> are in helicobacter, c- <dig> to c- <dig> in campylobacter. orthologous genes seen in different locus groups are italicized 



three closely related m.pabi and r.pabi homologs from two campylobacter coli strains  and c. jejuni strain atcc  <dig>  were located at the orthologous locus . however one lineage of c. coli  is reported to have experienced massive introgression from c. jejuni, and both c. coli strains for c- <dig> belong to clade i  <cit> . in fact, no other strains of c. coli contained the insertion of the pabi family . in view of these results, it is unlikely that insertion of pabi family is an ancestral feature shared by c. coli and c. jejuni.

among the h. pylori strains, m.pabi and r.pabi homolog gene pairs were similar. the amino acid identities of m.pabi and r.pabi homologs in j <dig>  and f <dig>  were 317/ <dig>  and 228/ <dig> , respectively. in h. pylori, the m.pabi and r.pabi homolog gene pair was located between dna gyrase b  and an outer membrane protein gene represented by hp0506/hp <dig> in strain jhp <dig> in strain/jhp <dig> in strain j <dig> .fig.  <dig> comparison of structures around the pabi family of rm systems in h. pylori, h. acinonychis and h. cetorum. a genome map comparison around the pabi family. only the two genes flanking the pabi family at each side are shown. orthologous genes are presented as boxes of the same color and pattern. red boxes represent m.pabi homologs and blue boxes are r.pabi homologs. b schematic structure of the ice insertion within r.pabi homologs in ny <dig> and els <dig>  each component is not in scale. the upper panel shows nested insertions of two ices within the r.pabi homolog gene in ny <dig>  the lower panel shows replacement of the right part of the icehptfs4b insert in els <dig>  compared with ny40



the only exception was els <dig> containing two r.pabi homologs, of which one was severely truncated. their protein sequences were identical in the alignable region. the r.pabi homolog next to m.pabi homolog was intact. comparison with genomes of the h. pylori strains, ny <dig> and p <dig>  revealed a 1577 bp duplication, coupled with insertion of a ~50 kb mobile genetic element . if this insertion was excluded, the pabi family was located at the same site as in other h. pylori strains. this mobile genetic element was recently characterized as two integrative and conjugative elements , designated icehptfs <dig> and icehptsf4b  <cit> . in the genome of ny <dig>  icehptfs4b was inserted within the r.pabi homolog, duplicating aagaatg, and icehptfs <dig> within the icehptfs4b copy, with aagaatg target site duplication in the opposite orientation. duplicated sequences were mutated in ny <dig> to aagaatt and aataatg. here, the r.pabi homolog gene was split into two segments, and the m.pabi homolog gene disrupted by mutations. in the els <dig> genome, the 1654 bp right terminal region of icehptsf4b was replaced by a duplicated 1577 bp segment containing part of the r.pabi homolog gene and part of an outer membrane protein gene. thus, this duplication possibly occurred via a gene conversion-like mechanism with incoming dna of intact r.pabi homolog as the template. the right junction appeared to result in homologous recombination and the left junction in non-homologous recombination. this recombination event resulted in a 1577 bp duplication sandwiching the ~50 kb ice insertion.

in the genomes of h. acinonychis and h. cetorum, two species closely related to h. pylori, the m.pabi and r.pabi homolog gene pair was located downstream of gyrb . the gene downstream of the pabi homolog gene pair was outer membrane protein  <dig> , which is absent in h. pylori. the intergenic sequence between gyrb and the m.pabi homolog was shorter than 10 bp and appeared conserved, except for h. cetorum mit 99– <dig>  which contained a sequence of unknown origin between the two genes . among these species, h. pylori and h. acinonychis are reported to be close, while h. cetorum is more divergent  <cit> . data from our phylogenetic analysis of m.pabi homologs were consistent with this relationship . the most parsimonious explanation is that the pabi family was integrated between gyrb and omp <dig> in the common ancestor of h. pylori, h. acinonychis and h. cetorum, and the downstream region rearranged. the results collectively suggest that the pabi family has been maintained for a long time in these species. linkage of rm systems with genome rearrangement junctions has been reported  <cit> .

m.pabi and r.pabi homologs at orthologous sites shared by genera
h- <dig> in the genus helicobacter and c- <dig> in campylobacter occur downstream of a homologous gene for gmp synthase . although gmp synthase in c- <dig> corresponds to only a c-terminal fragment of the complete protein, the two gmp synthase proteins are 88 % identical in the alignable region. the junctions between the genes for gmp synthase and m.pabi homolog in h- <dig> and c- <dig> resembled each other to a significant extent . a sequence almost identical to the junction sequence in h- <dig> was found in c. upsaliensis rm <dig>  followed by a gene for the m.pabi homolog . this m.pabi homolog  displayed 89 % amino acid sequence identity to that from h. cinaedi pagu <dig>  this m.pabi homolog is encoded near a contig end, and the partner r.pabi homolog is not on the contig. instead, we identified a fragmented r.pabi homolog  coded at the end of another contig . this r.pabi homolog is ~96 % identical to those in h. cinaedi and ~93 % to that in h. bilis. therefore it is very likely that eal <dig> and eal <dig> are an m.pabi and r.pabi homolog pair.

other c. upsaliensis strains, jv <dig> and dsm  <dig>  lacked the m.pabi and r.pabi homolog pair, but their sequences for gmp synthase were more similar to those of rm <dig> and some helicobacter species than those of other campylobacter species. it indicates that the gmp synthase gene was horizontally transferred from helicobacter to the common ancestor of c. upsaliensis. in the three strains of c. upsaliensis, the gmp synthase gene is followed by a non-homologous gene, indicating genome rearrangement downstream of the gmp synthase gene. a single event of horizontal transfer of the gmp synthase gene as well as the pabi family and subsequence recombination leading to the loss of the pabi family in some strains is more likely, compared with two independent horizontal transfer events  to the same genomic locus. thus, we conclude that the h- <dig> lineage is horizontally transferred from helicobacter to c. upsaliensis with the flanking gmp synthase gene.

the origin of insertion at c- <dig> in campylobacter sp. mit 97- <dig> is unknown at present. one possibility is that the pabi family was present in the common ancestor of campylobacter and helicobacter, and has been lost in many species/strains. we cannot eliminate another horizontal transfer between helicobacter and campylobacter, but even so, the transfer must be very old, considering their sequence diversity. long-term maintenance of the pabi family at the orthologous locus is the most likely scenario.

similarly, two adenylosuccinate lyase proteins encoded upstream of c- <dig> and h- <dig> displayed 73 % identity. the genome of h. muridarum have 6 m genes and  <dig> r genes between two non-rm genes there . here, recurrent acquisition of different rm systems has obscured the relationship between c- <dig> and h- <dig> , but we cannot exclude the orthology of these two loci.

gene neighborhood of the pabi family of rm systems
in h- <dig> and c- <dig>  pabi family is located in a putative operon whose genes are tightly linked in function and encoded on the same strand . glutamate synthase large chain and small chain are components of the same enzyme for glutamate metabolism. both imidazole glycerol phosphate dehydratase and imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase play a role in histidine metabolism. in these cases, the rm system is coded on the same strand as the neighboring genes. this type of operon insertion has been reported for other rm systems and operons  <cit> , and may impose operon maintenance and expression through post-segregational killing.

the pabi family is occasionally linked with other rm or toxin-antitoxin systems. the genes encoding defense system components, such as rm, toxin-antitoxin, and crispr-cas systems typically cluster in “defense islands”  <cit> . the pabi family in h. cinaedi pagu <dig> is flanked by an rm system. the pabi family in c. cuniculorum dsm  <dig> replaced a restriction enzyme gene . the extreme case is observed in h. muridarum . between two non-rm genes, there are 6 m genes and  <dig> r genes. the pabi family of h- <dig> and c- <dig> is flanked by genes for the rele toxin family. these two toxin genes show very weak sequence similarity to each other , indicating they represent independent association of rm system and rele toxin genes.

insertion of pabi family of rm system
genome sequence comparison among closely related species/strains revealed the mobility of the pabi family . comparison of staphylothermus hellenicus dsm  <dig> and s. marinus f <dig> revealed insertion into s. hellenicus of three orfs: r.pabi and m.pabi homologs and part of a penicillinase repressor . this pabi rm system replaced a 62 bp dna segment.fig.  <dig> integration of the pabi family of rm systems. two genome maps are compared. red boxed arrows indicate genes with coding directions. gene numbers or names are presented in or near the arrows. regions of sequence similarity between loci are indicated by red bands. junction sequences are shown below the genome map comparison. genes within the insertions with their annotations are shown on the right. a genome map comparison of staphylothermus marinus f <dig> and s. hellenicus dsm  <dig> around the pabi family in the s. hellenicus genome. b genome map comparison of campylobacter coli lmg  <dig> and c. coli 15– <dig> around the pabi family in the lmg  <dig> genome. c genome map comparison of campylobacter cuniculorum dsm  <dig>  c. upsaliensis rm <dig> and c. coli 111– <dig> around the pabi family in the dsm  <dig> genome



comparison of campylobacter coli lmg  <dig>  and 15– <dig> strains disclosed a sequence insertion only including two genes for r.pabi and m.pabi homologs . this rm system replaced the 4 bp sequence, agct. all c. coli strains available at the ncbi blast website other than lmg  <dig> and h <dig> displayed a conserved structure identical to 15- <dig>  taaa tetranucleotides were observed at the insertion boundary, although it is unclear whether they represent target site duplications.

comparison of campylobacter cuniculorum dsm <dig>  and c. upsaliensis rm <dig> revealed replacement of a putative type ii rm system r gene with a pabi family . the  m gene neighboring the replaced r gene and flanking hrga gene were disrupted in the dsm <dig> genome. the hrga gene was previously reported to replace a restriction enzyme gene in h. pylori  <cit> , but the hrga gene seen here does not replace an rm system. the putative type ii rm system itself was possibly inserted in the ancestral locus of these two genomes, since campylobacter coli 111– <dig> lacks the type ii rm system. according to rebase , this putative rm system recognizes 5’gantc.

identification of two members of the pabi family of rm system in h. macacae mit 99-5501
we identified two pabi family members from h. macacae mit 99- <dig> . one r.pabi homolog  was disrupted, but the other r.pabi homolog  and both m.pabi homologs  appeared intact. phylogenetic analysis  indicated that these two members of the pabi family were independently acquired by h. macacae. one m.pabi homolog , associated with a disrupted r.pabi homolog, was most closely related to that from helicobacter trogontum , and the other  neighboring an intact r.pabi homolog  related to that from brachyspira .

shared rearrangement in the pabi family of rm system in hspeasia and hspamerind
some r.pabi homolog genes in h. pylori are disrupted due to frameshift, nonsense mutations, and/or deletions . all hspamerind strains sequenced completely to date contain a large deletion within the pabi family . the same deletion is observed in some hspeasia strains, such as  <dig> ,  <dig>  f <dig>  and ok <dig> . sequence comparisons revealed that these deletions are caused by replacement with a dna segment containing one gene, annotated hrgc . while this substitution was previously reported  <cit> , its geographical distribution remains to be established. among the complete genomes for h. pylori, only hspamerind and hspeasia strains contained hrgc , placed in an opposite orientation to the m.pabi and r.pabi homologs. hspeasia is subdivided into  <dig> subgroups in yahara et al.  <cit> , and no subgroup show uniform presence/absence of hrgc .fig.  <dig> replacement of the pabi family of rm system with hrgc. a distribution of the pabi homolog vs. hrgc gene in each population of h. pylori. only strains that have been completely sequenced and deposited in refseq were counted. analyzed strains are documented in additional file 2: table s <dig>  b genome map comparison around hrgc genes. orthologous genes are shown as boxes with the same color and pattern. white boxes represent hrgc genes. c distribution of the pabi homolog vs. hrgc gene in east asia subgroups of h. pylori. only strains reported in yahara et al.  <cit>  are analyzed. d alignment of hrgc proteins. the c-terminal  <dig> residues of the escherichia hrgc protein are omitted. roman numbers right of the h. pylori and h. acinonychis strain names indicate the hrgc lineages shown in fig.  <dig>  accession numbers are as follows. puno <dig>  aen15115; f <dig>  baj56916; ok <dig>  bam98251; oki <dig>  ahn34853; hpa- <dig>  wp_000301367; g <dig>  aci26869; sheeba, yp_665190; fusobacterium, yp_008019852; bacillus, ejs64418; escherichia, ait <dig>  e geographic distribution of hrgc gene. three lineages of hrgc are colored differently. green arrows indicate two human migration routes



the hrgc gene encodes a small protein with a length of < <dig> residues . although the function of hrgc gene has not been confirmed, its homologs have been identified in various bacteria, including escherichia coli and bacillus cereus, indicating horizontal transfer of the gene. secondary structure prediction with jpred <dig>   <cit>  indicated that the hrgc protein contains one transmembrane helix. this result is consistent with the annotation of some hrgc homologs as inner membrane proteins. these features are found in toxins of type i toxin-antitoxin systems  <cit> , leading to the speculation that hrgc is a toxin of a toxin-antitoxin system .

the 5’-terminal 78 bp m.pabi and 3’-terminal 88 bp r.pabi homolog genes were observed at the locus in these hrgc-encoding strains, indicating that the pabi family is replaced by the hrgc gene and not vice versa .

hrgc was also located between dnak and cysk in the genome of helicobacter acinonychis sheeba as well as several h. pylori strains, such as g <dig> . this finding is in keeping with the report that h. acinonychis and h. pylori strain nsh <dig>  contain the hrgc gene at a locus distinct from the “pabi” locus  <cit> . the locus is occupied by a gene that encodes a protein similar to the n-terminal region of mcrb in most h. pylori strains. mcrb is a dna binding subunit of type iv  restriction endonuclease that acts in concert with mcrc  <cit> . notably, the 166 bp 5’ fragment of the m.pabi gene was associated with the hrgc gene at the “mcrb” locus . compared with hrgc proteins encoded at the “pabi” locus, those encoded at the “mcrb” locus lacked a ~ <dig> aa segment . this difference may be due to an insertion in the lineage at the “pabi” locus, since hrgc proteins encoded within the genomes of other species do not contain a sequence corresponding to this  <dig> aa segment. thus, insertion of  <dig> aa segment is likely a derived feature.

the tblastn search with hrgc protein as a query against the whole genome shotgun sequence  database led to the identification of several more h. pylori strains containing the hrgc gene. these sequences were encoded at either the “pabi” or “mcrb” locus . interestingly, hrgc proteins encoded at the “pabi” locus in some strains lacked the ~ <dig> aa segment , including four strains  from okinawa, japan, three from north america , 173/ <dig> from portugal, and a <dig> from russia. in summary, hrgc proteins with the ~ <dig> aa segment have been identified from japan, korea, china, malaysia, and south america .

hrgc phylogeny
to trace the origin of replacement of the pabi family of the rm system with the hrgc gene, we performed phylogenetic analysis based on the hrgc protein sequences . as expected, all hrgc proteins from h. pylori and h. acinonychis clustered together. the most distant lineage included hrgc proteins encoded at the “pabi” locus and lacking the ~ <dig> aa segment . to confirm their distant phylogenetic positions, we generated another phylogenetic tree based on sequences excluding the ~ <dig> aa segment, with the same topology . the phylogenetic position of the hrgc proteins encoded at the “mcrb” locus  was unexpected considering their locus different from those of the other lineages , both of which are located at the same “pabi” locus, but this position is not well statistically supported.fig.  <dig> phylogeny of hrgc proteins from h. pylori and h. acinonychis. seven bacterial hrgc sequences  were used as outgroups to determine the root. bootstrap values of  <dig> replicates over 50 % are shown at the nodes. strain names belonging to hspeasia are colored in blue, hspamerind in red and hpasia <dig> in green. the gene map near hrgc is illustrated on the right. lineage iiia corresponding to the hpasia <dig> strains shows a chimeric structure of the locus containing hrgc  and that containing the pabi family 



hrgc protein sequences from hpasia <dig> strains were identical to those from some hspeasia strains. among the malaysian strains, three  from the malaysian chinese population belonged to hspeasia  <cit> . five strains  from malaysian indians and one strain  from malays belonged to hpasia <dig>   <cit> . two  encoded  <dig> of  <dig> aa of the r.pabi homolog besides hrgc . the remaining four hpasia <dig> strains  displayed a 124 bp deletion within the r.pabi homolog coding region. these findings collectively suggest horizontal transfer of the hrgc gene from hspeasia to hpasia <dig> 

discussion
the pabi family of rm systems displays characteristics similar to other rm systems
the pabi family is unique, encoding a sequence-specific dna glycosylase/ap lyase as the restriction enzyme  <cit> . all other reported rm systems examined to date encode a certain type of dna phosphodiesterase  <cit> . despite fundamental differences in catalytic activity, the pabi family shares many features with other rm systems. genes for pabi family of restriction glycosylase and adenine methyltransferase genes are tightly associated . phylogenetic analyses support the theory that that they move together as a unit . genome comparisons of closely related strains revealed insertion of the glycosylase and methyltransferase gene pair . these features are shared with other rm systems.

cross-species and cross-genus distribution of orthologous pabi family of rm systems
orthologous insertions of the closely related pabi family across species are observed in helicobacter and campylobacter species . c- <dig> represents recent horizontal transfer between species, while h- <dig> and h- <dig> possibly indicate insertion in the common ancestor.

both h- <dig> in the genus helicobacter and c- <dig> in campylobacter are located downstream of an orthologous gene for gmp synthase. we cannot exclude the possibility that this reflects a preference for the insertion site by the pabi family, but in that case, the underlying molecular mechanism or possible biological significance  remains to be established. recent horizontal transfer between different genera cannot explain the sequence divergence between h- <dig> and c- <dig> in campylobacter sp. mit 97– <dig>  the similarity of the c- <dig> locus in a strain of c. upsaliensis  shows a clear case of horizontal transfer from helicobacter to campylobacter . it is likely that the presence of the pabi family downstream of the gmp synthase gene represents an ancient insertion that has been maintained in some strains of these two genera via vertical transmission, possibly coupled with horizontal transfer. another possibility is an ancient event of horizontal transfer between genera. in our knowledge, there is no report showing long-term maintenance of rm systems leading to their cross-genus distribution. this is the first report of such maintenance. we do not consider it is related to the exceptional catalytic activity of r.pabi homolog, and are convinced that many more cases of long-term maintenance of rm systems be found in the near future.

replacement of the pabi family of rm system with an hrgc gene provides clues on human migration history
in some h. pylori strains, the pabi family was replaced by an hrgc-coding dna segment. phylogenetic analysis revealed three hrgc lineages in helicobacter . the history of lineage iii is easy to reconstruct . a strain of h. pylori acquired the hrgc gene that replaced part of the pabi family in east asia. one of its descendant lineages moved to the americas, forming the hspamerind lineage. the uniform presence of hrgc in the hspamerind lineage is consistent with the isolation of amerind people in the americas. in contrast, the other descendant lineage was mixed with other hpeastasia strains in east asia, leading to sporadic distribution of the hrgc gene in hspeasia. finally, chinese people moved to malaysia and the hrgc gene in the hspeasia strain was transferred to the hpasia <dig> strain. this transfer left a fragment of r.pabi homolog, indicating that the replacement is initiated at the m.pabi homolog side . a previous analysis of h. pylori in southeast asia revealed that malaysian hspeasia strains migrated with chinese people from guangzhou and hong kong, china within the last 200 years  <cit> . thus the transfer of hrgc from hspeasia to hpasia <dig> was a quite recent event. it agrees with the completely identical protein sequences of hrgc among the hpasia <dig> strains. the transfer of dna segments occurs generally between family members  <cit> . thus the presence of hrgc gene in hpasia <dig> strains indicates the intermarriage of chinese immigrant and either malay or indian immigrant. the information for such a single event may be lost in the genome-wide study.

in lineage ii, the position of h. acinonychis sheeba is the most divergent. the clustering of all h. pylori strains is reasonable. the origination of the lineage ii hrgc gene remains an open question. lineages i and iii contain the hrgc gene at the “pabi” locus. the simplest explanation is that hrgc gene moved from “pabi” to the “mcrb” locus in the common ancestor of lineage ii. notably, lineage ii has the 166 bp fragment of m.pabi homolog, while both i and iii contain only the 78 bp fragment of m.pabi homolog . thus, the possibility that the pabi family may have once been inserted at the “mcrb” locus and was replaced by hrgc in lineage ii cannot be discounted.

lineage i lacks the ~ <dig> aa segment at the “pabi” locus. thus, if replacement of pabi family with hrgc occurred only once, the lineage would retain the original structure. this lineage was obtained from japan, russia and north america , and their genomes are related to those of hpeurope strains based on the ribosomal protein sequences . the geographic distribution of lineage i raises the possibility that this sequence was derived from a population in siberia, and shares the origin with lineage iii, which was originated in east asia.

hrgc was similar to toxins of type i toxin-antitoxin systems in size, with a secondary structure suggestive of a transmembrane helix  <cit>  and apparent mobility between genomes  <cit> . the toxin-antitoxin and rm systems are analogous from many viewpoints, including attack on host bacteria and gene regulation pathways sometimes involving antisense rna  <cit> . the genes encoding defense system components, such as rm, toxin-antitoxin, and crispr-cas systems, typically cluster in islands called “defense islands”  <cit> . our findings may indicate stepwise evolution of coupling and co-transfer of rm and toxin-antitoxin systems. more specifically, the promoter for m.pabi homolog may provide an antisense rna  suppressing the expression of hrgc, a putative toxin. inhibition of this promoter would lead to attack on the host through post-segregational killing in the pabi family, as well as the composite of hrgc  and m.pabi homolog fragment. this may represent takeover of an rm system by a type i toxin. this is just a speculation at present, not supported by any experimental data, but it is worth mentioning to encourage further study. linkage of the pabi family of the rm system with a toxin gene  may have similar significance.

CONCLUSIONS
r.pabi is an exceptional restriction enzyme that acts as a sequence-specific dna glycosylase. despite their unique characteristics, r.pabi homologs show similar ways of existence to restriction dna phosphodiesterases, including co-occurrence and co-mobilization with a methyltransferase  gene, and linkage with the genome rearrangement junctions. these findings are consistent with the theory that the pabi family of rm system is a typical mobile selfish genetic element.

despite the obvious mobility between genomes, the pabi family of rm system is occasionally observed at the same locus of different strains, species or even genera. this may be attributed to ancient insertion of these rm systems that are maintained via vertical transmission, probably coupled with occasional horizontal transfer via homologous recombination.

the pabi family of rm system is occasionally replaced by an hrgc gene-containing dna segment in h. pylori strains. this substitution possibly occurred in the common ancestor of hspeasia and hspamerind. the hspamerind strains retain this structure owing to geographic isolation, while only a small proportion of hspeasia strains retain the hrgc gene, indicating that their admixture with strains diverged earlier than the substitution event. in malaysia, hrgc was horizontally transferred from hspeasia to hpasia <dig> strains. the genetic admixture of h. pylori strains would have occurred in an individual or a population, revealing traces of human migration history.
