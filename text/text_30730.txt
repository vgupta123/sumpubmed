BACKGROUND
sweetpotato  is a key food crop worldwide, with high levels of vitamin a and other essential nutrients; sweetpotatoes also produce large quantities of biomass suitable for conversion to bioethanol  <cit> . sweetpotato storage roots  function in carbohydrate storage and vegetative propagation  <cit>  and form from adventitious roots. adventitious roots develop from nodal primordia and cut ends or wounds of stem  at 5– <dig> days after transplanting. these adventitious roots can then form srs by a process that involves thickening of the vascular tissue, followed by the accumulation of starch and proteins  <cit> . adventitious roots can also form fibrous roots , which undergo lignification of the stele; in contrast to frs, srs do not undergo stele lignification . the conversion of adventitious roots to srs involves the formation of new cambial cells, followed by the development of secondary cambium and thin-walled parenchyma cells. despite its importance, key factors in sr development remain to be discovered.

although the molecular mechanism underlying the transition from adventitious roots to srs in sweetpotato is not yet clear, substantial prior work has implicated the plant hormones cytokinin, auxin, and abscisic acid  in the formation and thickening of srs . for example, aba functions in the secondary thickening of vascular cambium during sr formation in sweetpotato  <cit> . transcription factors from various families have also been implicated in sr formation. for example, the transcription factor gene ibmads <dig>  is expressed during the early stages of sr initiation  <cit> ; also, cytokinins and jasmonic acid induce the expression of ibmads <dig>  noh et al.  <cit>  isolated a cdna encoding the mads-box protein srd <dig>  which plays an important role in the formation of srs by activating the proliferation of cambium and metaxylem cells to induce the initial thickening of srs. the expression of srd <dig> is regulated by the auxin indole-3-acetic acid. also, overexpression of the class i knotted1-like homeobox  genes, ibkn <dig> and ibkn <dig>  results in increased cytokinin activity in sweetpotato, indicating that knox <dig> functions in controlling cytokinin levels in srs  <cit> .

expression analysis during sr formation also identified a number of candidate genes . for example, you et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes by comparing early srs and fibrous roots. several nac family transcription factor genes are downregulated in srs, and two nam-like genes, as well as sporamin genes and genes involved in starch biosynthesis, are upregulated in srs  at six weeks after planting  <cit> . noh et al.  <cit>  used antisense rna interference to demonstrate the negative role of an expansin gene  in sr development; ibexp <dig> suppresses the proliferation of metaxylem and cambium cells, and thus inhibits the initial thickening of srs.

recent work used microarray and next-generation sequencing technologies to examine the molecular mechanism of sr formation in sweetpotato. wang et al.  <cit>  used microarray analysis to identify transcription factors involved in sr development, such as da1-related proteins, short-root, and bel1-like proteins. using illumina sequencing, tao et al.  <cit>  identified genes that are differentially expressed at different stages of sweetpotato root formation. in particular, they found that a gene encoding sucrose phosphate synthase, which functions in sucrose metabolism, is highly expressed in srs than in fibrous roots. firon et al.  <cit>  analyzed the root transcriptomes of sweetpotato srs and non-storage/fibrous roots and demonstrated that phenylpropanoid pathway genes, such as those encoding coumaroyl coa-synthase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase, are downregulated during the conversion of frs to srs, whereas starch metabolism genes, such as those encoding adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase and starch synthase, are upregulated in srs.

the cultivated sweetpotato likely evolved from the wild tetraploid i. trifida and diploid i. trifida/i. tabascana species ; these wild relatives do not form srs. previous transcriptome analyses investigating sr formation examined only the hexaploid cultivated species  <cit> . therefore, comparative transcriptome analysis of the wild and cultivated species of sweetpotato may advance our knowledge on the mechanism underlying sr formation in this important crop. in this study, we performed transcriptome analysis of the roots from cultivated sweetpotato  and its non-tuber forming relative  to elucidate possible pathways and candidate genes involved in sr formation.

RESULTS
de novo assembly of root transcriptomes using illumina sequencing
high-throughput sequencing of the root transcriptomes of cultivated ipomoea batatas  and its wild ancestor ipomoea trifida  generated  <dig> and  <dig> million reads, respectively. all reads were assembled using trinity  with default parameters. the maximum contig length was  <dig>  bp for ib and  <dig>  bp for it . the contigs were grouped based on sequence length at an interval of  <dig> base pairs . the majority of contigs were ranged from 200–399 bp in length , followed by 400–599 bp . in addition,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the contigs were 600–3000 bp in length for ib and it respectively, and only  <dig> % of the contigs in ib and  <dig> % of the contigs in it were >3000 bp long .table  <dig> summary of rna-seq reads from ib and it

functional annotation by sequence comparison with public databases
to perform functional annotation of the ib and it contigs, we used blastx  <cit>  with a cutoff e-value of  <dig> e- <dig> to search public databases, such as the non-redundant , arabidopsis, cassava, and potato databases, and the sweetpotato gene index. this analysis showed that  <dig> % of ib transcripts and  <dig> % of it transcripts matched the non-redundant  database, but only  <dig> % of ib and  <dig> % of it transcripts matched the arabidopsis database. similarity searches of the sweetpotato gene index revealed matches of only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of transcripts for ib and it, respectively. the low percentage of ib and it transcripts with sequence similarity to sweetpotato gene index may be attributed to the limited number of annotated genes in the database. searches of the potato and cassava databases also showed the same degree of similarity as found for searches of the arabidopsis database . overall,  <dig> % of the transcripts from ib and  <dig> % of the transcripts from it showed homology with at least one database. the detailed functional annotation for each species is presented in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> table  <dig> blast annotation of ib and it transcripts

comparative analysis of gene sets between ib and it
to allow direct comparison of loci between ib and it, we used the annotated transcripts to identify orthologous and paralogous genes in ib and it. among the  <dig> paralogous gene sets with  <dig> contigs identified in ib,  <dig> contigs had no match in the arabidopsis database, whereas the remaining  <dig> transcripts that matched with the arabidopsis database were found to be involved in cellular organization, membrane transport, glucose metabolic activity, and carbohydrate metabolism. however, none of the  <dig> paralogous gene sets identified in ib had matches in the sweetpotato gene index, most likely due to the small number of annotated genes available in this database . in it, we identified  <dig>  paralogous gene sets with  <dig>  contigs. among  <dig>  contigs,  <dig>  contigs had no match in the arabidopsis database; the remaining  <dig>  transcripts, which matched with the arabidopsis database, were involved in transporter activity, stress-related functions, and ribosomal proteins involved in translation. in contrast, only  <dig> transcripts, which matched with sweetpotato gene index, showed annotated gene functions . we also identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts in ib and it, respectively, from  <dig>  orthologous gene sets. examples of orthologous genes include calcium-dependent lipid binding  domain and the porcino tubulin-binding cofactor, which are involved in stress and defense responses. calb-domain genes are upregulated in drought-stressed sweetpotato  <cit> . the transcription factors observed among the orthologs include knox, bel- <dig> like homeodomain, and nac domain-containing proteins that are involved in dna binding and transcription activities. in sweetpotato, knox <dig> is involved in secondary thickening of the srs through enhanced cytokinin activity  <cit>  and bel- <dig> like homeodomain involved in sr development  <cit> . the nac domain-containing proteins are upregulated in sweetpotato srs compared to fibrous roots  <cit> . overall, the orthologous genes and transcription factors in both ib and it are involved in activities such as nucleic acid binding, defense responses, cell division and differentiation, transport, root gravitropism, hormonal control, and glucose metabolism .

among paralogous gene sets, genes encoding the rhamnogalacturonate lyase  family proteins, k+ efflux antiporter , and erecta protein kinases were found only in ib. rgl proteins comprise the major components of pectin polysaccharides in the cell wall  <cit> . rgl proteins also serve as signaling molecules for pectin polysaccharides  <cit> , and are involved in cell wall modifications such as cell wall expansion, porosity, and textural changes during fruit ripening . in arabidopsis, the expression of rgl genes, which are involved in lateral root and root hair formation, is altered in response to the inhibition of primary root growth  <cit> . also, in potato , overexpression of rgl genes leads to distinct morphological changes in the cortex and periderm  <cit> . the expression of rgl genes  value of  <dig> ) only in ib suggests that pectin polysaccharides may play a role in cell expansion leading to the accumulation of storage proteins in developing srs and that rgl proteins may have important roles in the secondary thickening of cell walls.

k+  transporter genes  are another group of genes that are expressed specifically in ib. these transporters are involved in stomatal activity, leaf movements, ion transport, and the regulation of phytohormones such as auxin, ethylene, and jasmonic acid  <cit> . k+ transporters also play an important role in cell expansion associated with turgor pressure in arabidopsis  <cit> . the expression of kea <dig> transporter genes in ib suggests that they may play a role in sr formation through the regulation of phytohormones such as auxin. in plant roots, auxin regulates lateral root development and gravitropism  <cit> . in sweetpotato, auxin regulates the expression of the transcription factor srd <dig>  which is involved in sr formation  <cit> . therefore, the coordinated regulation of transporter genes such as kea <dig> and transcription factors such as srd <dig> in auxin regulation may be a possibility during sr formation in sweetpotato. in the present study, in addition to rgl family genes and kea <dig>  erecta protein kinase  was also identified in the paralogous genes of ib but not in it. erecta protein kinase is a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase  involved in the proliferation of organelles. erecta protein kinases regulate organ shape and inflorescence development in arabidopsis  <cit> . interestingly, receptor-like kinases are involved in lateral root development in arabidopsis  <cit>  and cell wall-bound kinases are associated with pectin binding in arabidopsis  <cit> . erecta, along with rgl family proteins, might represent an important link between the regulation of cell wall structure and sr development in sweetpotato. among the transcription factors in paralogous genes, rkd  belongs to the rwp-rk domain-containing proteins, which are involved in dna binding and regulation of transcription activity, were expressed in ib but not in it. the rwp-rk protein domain is required for embryonic pattern formation  <cit>  and plays a key role in regulating responses to nitrogen availability  <cit> . recent work reported that nit <dig>  a member of the rwp-rk family, influences starch and lipid storage in chlamydomonas  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana, nlp <dig>  another member of the rwp-rk family, is an early regulator of cellular response to nitrogen assimilation  <cit> . the unique expression of rwp-rk proteins  only in ib indicate that these proteins may have a role in nitrogen regulation and starch formation during the development of sweetpotato srs.

expression of genes involved in sr formation
we compared the expression of genes in ib versus it based on their respective fpkm values . although two species were compared to estimate up— or down-regulation of gene expression, a clear limitation in our study is the lack of biological replications. therefore, conclusions reached in this study, may change in future experiments with biological replications. while hundreds or thousands of mapped reads of differentially expressed genes are likely to be reliable, careful reading is required for the contigs/transcripts with few mapped hits. some evidence for this differential gene expression is supported by the qrt-pcr results . in the present study, the class-i knotted1-like homeobox gene knox <dig> was highly expressed in ib  compared to it . similarly, firon et al.  <cit>  observed the increased expression of knox <dig> in developing sweetpotato srs versus frs. knox <dig> is also associated with higher cytokinin levels, in addition to secondary thickening, in sweetpotato srs  <cit> . the cell wall loosening protein expansin was highly represented in ib  compared to it . firon et al.  <cit>  demonstrated the involvement of this expansin gene in the initiating srs of sweetpotato. also, the gene encoding the sporamin was highly expressed in ib  than in it  . sporamin, a key storage protein in sweetpotato srs  <cit> , forms in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the mature sporamin moves to the vacuoles of srs  <cit> . in sweetpotato, sporamin was accounted for over 80% of the total protein in the srs  <cit>  and highly expressed in srs than in frs  <cit> . the high expression of sporamin in ib confirmed its role in the synthesis of storage proteins. in the present study, starch and sucrose metabolic genes, such as β-amylase , glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase , phosphoglucomutase , starch synthase , adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase , and alpha 1– <dig> glucan phosphorylase  were highly expressed in ib. similar to our study, the high expression of the gene encoding β-amylase is observed in the initiating srs compared to fibrous roots in sweetpotato  <cit> . also, the increased expression of adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase is associated with starch accumulation in sweetpotato srs  <cit> . clearly, the high expression of both β-amylase, the second most abundant storage protein in sweetpotato after sporamin  <cit> , and adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase is positively correlated to their role in starch biosynthesis in sweetpotato  <cit> . in the present study, we observed higher expression of the gene encoding phosphoglucomutase in ib than in it, indicating that the enhanced activity of this enzyme may provide abundant substrate for adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase, the first step in starch biosynthesis pathway. indeed, enhanced expression of phosphoglucomutase was previously observed in the srs of sweetpotato  <cit> . another highly expressed gene in ib encodes alpha 1– <dig> glucan phosphorylase, an enzyme involved in starch phosphorylation in arabidopsis  <cit> . the phosphorylation of starch promotes the accumulation of starch granules in the srs of sweetpotato  <cit> . the high expression of genes encoding phosphoglucomutase and alpha 1– <dig> glucan phosphorylase in ib reflects the high activity of starch metabolic genes in srs.table  <dig> comparison of annotated genes involved in storage root formation between ib and it using fpkm values

fig.  <dig> validation of relative expression levels of selected genes . expression levels were compared between i. batatas  and i. trifida . quantitative rt-pcr was performed with three biological replicates and two technical replicates for both ib and it. the sweetpotato β-tubulin gene was used as an endogenous control and the gene expression levels were determined using the ΔΔct method. genes are shown with respective tair locus ids: β-amylase ; adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase ; starch synthase ; knox: class i knotted-like homeobox ; expansin ; epsp: 5- enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase ; erf: ethylene-responsive transcription factor ; comt: caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferase ; cad: cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 




expression of genes involved in non-storage/fibrous root formation
we compared the expression of genes in it versus ib based on their respective fpkm values . the results indicate that genes encoding cysteine protease , cysteine proteinase , ethylene responsive transcription factor  , osmotin-like proteins , and peroxidase  were highly expressed in it. cysteine protease is involved in the degradation of sporamin in sprouting sweetpotato srs  <cit> . in addition, the cysteine protease gene is downregulated in sweetpotato srs  <cit> . in our study, a cysteine protease gene was highly expressed in it, indicating that this enzyme may prevent the accumulation of sporamin in the roots and helps them remain as fibrous roots. cysteine proteinases also exhibit protein degradation activity  <cit> . the cysteine proteinase gene is upregulated in frs compared to the srs in sweetpotato  <cit> . we observed similar high expression of the cysteine proteinase gene in it, indicating that this enzyme may be involved in proteolytic activity and promotes the development of frs. genes encoding osmotin-like protein were highly expressed in it compared to ib . the osmotin-like proteins are plant defense proteins  <cit>  that regulate the production of jasmonic acid and ethylene in arabidopsis  <cit> . in sweetpotato, the osmotic-like stress response genes are downregulated in the srs compared to frs  <cit> . the ethylene responsive transcription factor  was highly expressed in it than ib, indicating the activity of this stress-responsive gene in the fibrous roots. likewise, genes encoding peroxidase showed decreased expression in ib versus it, indicating that peroxidase genes may be involved in phenylpropanoid and lignin  biosynthesis pathways  <cit> . another stress-response gene, which encodes succinate dehydrogenase, was minimally increased in it versus ib; succinate dehydrogenase functions in the production of reactive-oxygen species during stress-related activities  <cit> . overall, the higher expression of proteolytic enzymes such as cysteine protease and cysteine proteinase in it indicates that these genes may prevent the accumulation of storage proteins in the developing frs. moreover, the higher expression of stress-response genes such as those encoding peroxidases promotes the expression of phenylpropanoid pathway genes and the accumulation of lignin in frs in sweetpotato  <cit> .table  <dig> comparison of annotated genes involved in fibrous root formation between ib and it using fpkm values

in addition, lignification helps roots remain as non-storage/fibrous roots and prevents the conversion of fibrous roots to srs. in the current study, we observed higher expression of genes encoding phenylpropanoid and lignin biosynthetic enzymes, such as 5-enolpyruvylshikimate- <dig> phosphate  synthase , phenylalanine ammonia-lyase  , 4-coumarate-coa ligase  , cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase  , peroxidase , and caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferase   in it . the enzyme epsp synthase produces an important precursor in the shikimate pathway, promotes the synthesis of lignin and phenylalanine  <cit> . consistent with our observations, other studies showed that in sweetpotato, genes encoding cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, coumaroyl-coa synthase, and caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferase are downregulated during sr initiation  <cit> . moreover, lignin biosynthesis genes are upregulated in the early stages of fibrous root formation in sweetpotato  <cit> . the increased expression of the phenylpropanoid and lignin genes in it provides evidence for the accumulation of lignins during fr development.

validation of gene expression through quantitative reverse-transcription pcr 
we profiled different genes, based on fpkm values, for expression in ib and it with the rna samples used for illumina sequencing. genes involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, and lignin biosynthesis, such as those encoding adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase, β-amylase, starch synthase, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase , and caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferase  were selected for qrt-pcr. the genes and their respective primers are presented in additional file  <dig>  the qrt-pcr results indicated the starch metabolic genes such as adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase, beta-amylase, and starch synthase were highly expressed in ib than in it . the high expression of starch metabolism genes in ib reflects the movement of storage proteins during sr development. a similar finding for starch metabolism genes was previously reported in sweetpotato  <cit> . the qrt-pcr results showed that the gene encoding expansin was more highly expressed in ib than in it. by contrast, noh et al.  <cit>  found that the expression of the expansin gene is inhibited during sr formation in sweetpotato. however, firon et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the expansin gene is involved in sr formation in sweetpotato. in the present study, the meristematic regulatory gene knox <dig> was highly expressed in ib, which was previously demonstrated in the development of sweetpotato srs  <cit> . the qrt-pcr results showed that the gene ethylene response factor  was expressed at higher levels in it than in ib. by contrast, firon et al.  <cit>  showed high expression of erf in sweetpotato srs compared to frs of the cultivar georgia jet. the shikimate pathway gene encoding epsp synthase was highly expressed in it. this enzyme forms an important precursor in the shikimate pathway and promotes the biosynthesis of lignin  <cit> . the qrt-pcr results showed that the lignin biosynthetic genes cad and comt were highly expressed in it compared to ib. in summary, the high expression of starch and sucrose metabolism genes in ib promotes sr formation, whereas the high expression of lignin biosynthetic genes in it promotes the development of frs/non-storage roots.

functional classification of transcripts using gene ontology  and pathway analysis
the ib and it annotated transcripts were grouped into three biological functions such as biological process, molecular function, and cellular component using the go slim database  <cit> . the majority of go annotations  were grouped into the biological process category, followed by molecular function . in addition,  <dig> % of ib and  <dig> % of it transcripts were grouped in the cellular component category . most transcripts in the biological process category are involved in oxidation-reduction processes, protein phosphorylation, regulation of transcription, metabolic processes, salt stress, and signal transduction and translation. the transcripts in the molecular function category are involved in atp binding, protein binding, dna binding, phosphorus transferase, and catalytic activity. the transcripts grouped within the cellular component category were based on their predicted sub-cellular locations in the nucleus, plasma membrane, chloroplast, cytoplasm, extracellular space, and vacuole. similar groupings of annotated genes have been reported in previous sweetpotato root transcriptome studies  <cit> .fig.  <dig> functional classification of transcripts using gene ontology. i. batatas  transcripts are indicated in blue, and i. trifida  transcripts are indicated in red. the non-redundant transcripts were subjected to functional classification using goslim




the annotated transcripts between ib and it were assigned to various biological pathways using david  <cit> . a total of  <dig>   and  <dig>   transcripts were assigned to  <dig> and  <dig> pathways in ib and it respectively. further, we also examined the pathways that are differentially enriched in ib and it. the enriched transcripts in ib and it  showed  <dig> major pathways that are involved in storage/fibrous roots . the list of transcripts and kegg-enriched pathways from david are presented in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  in ib, we observed a higher percentage of differentially expressed transcripts in the starch  and sucrose biosynthetic pathways  compared to it . the increased expression of sucrose and starch metabolic genes indicated the synthesis of sucrose and starch in the storage roots  <cit> . we also detected a large percentage of transcripts in ib  than in it  for udp-glucose biosynthesis, which is involved in the synthesis of udp glucose. the increased expression of transcripts for udp-glucose biosynthesis in ib indicates the increased activity of udp sugars in the storage roots. in ib, enrichment of transcripts involved in the homogalacturonan pathway  was observed in comparison with it , which indicates the accumulation of pectins in the storage roots. the pectin in the primary cell walls forms from homogalacturonans, rhamnogalacturonan-i, and rhamnogalacturonan-ii  <cit> , and strengthens the cell wall of the developing srs.fig.  <dig> functional classification of transcripts using david. i. batatas  transcripts are indicated in blue, and i. trifida  transcripts are indicated in red. the functional grouping was based on kegg pathway names associated with transcripts from david analysis




the percentage of transcripts of secondary metabolic pathways such as the anthocyanin  and flavonoid biosynthetic pathways  were more represented in ib than it . this is in contrast to the results of firon et al.  <cit>  who reported higher expression of anthocyanin and flavonoids in frs than in srs of sweetpotato. the more representation of anthocyanin and flavonoids in our study could be due to the use of orange-fleshed beauregard variety. earlier transcriptome studies showed that genes related to production of anthocyanin and flavonoid compounds were highly expressed in purple and yellow-colored sweetpotato srs  <cit> .

the transcripts representing the phenylpropanoid pathway  and phenylalanine biosynthesis  were more represented in it than ib  indicating the synthesis of lignin in the fibrous/non-storage roots. similar results of higher phenylalanine biosynthesis were observed in the frs of sweetpotato  <cit> . transcripts of the pyruvate decarboxylation pathway were also more represented in it  than ib . the pyruvate decarboxylation pathway participates in carbohydrate metabolism and down-regulates the synthesis of glucose. in sweetpotato, firon et al.  <cit>  demonstrated the downregulation of pyruvate decarboxylase in the srs in comparison with the frs. we also observed more representation of transcripts related to biosynthesis of glucosinolate  and cysteine , which are involved in stress and defense responses, in it compared to ib . in arabidopsis, the expression of glucosinolate occurs in the antifungal defense response  <cit> . in sweetpotato, firon et al.  <cit>  showed the high representation of cysteine biosynthesis genes, consistent with the results of our study, in the non-storage/fibrous roots. in addition, transcripts of purine and pyrimidine metabolism, which are involved in the synthesis of nucleic acids and energy carriers in the cell  <cit> , were more represented in it  than ib .

identification of simple sequence repeat  markers
we predicted potential microsatellite markers based on the assembled transcripts generated from ib and it using ssrfinder  <cit>  and misa   <cit> . we mined for new microsatellite markers in ib and it using  <dig>  and  <dig>  transcripts, respectively. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  microsatellite markers were identified in ib and it, respectively . the list of identified ssrs, along with the associated forward and reverse primers are presented in additional file  <dig>  and additional file  <dig> . overall, the results indicate that di-nucleotide repeats  were most abundant in both ib and it. the percentage difference in the number of ssrs identified with di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotide repeats was higher in it than in ib . functional genetic markers such as ssrs are useful in understanding the genetic variation in plants  <cit> .table  <dig> number of ssrs predicted in ib and it

prediction of single nucleotide polymorphisms  and insertions and deletions  between ib and it
the reads of ib were mapped to the transcripts of it to identify the unique snps for ib and vice versa for it. a total of  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig>   unique snps were identified for each species . within orthologous genes,  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps were identified in ib and it, respectively. also,  <dig>   and  <dig>  snps were identified within paralogous genes. a list of snps is provided in additional file  <dig> for ib and additional file  <dig> for it. snps and indels, the most abundant genetic variations in the genome, are often exploited for high-throughput genotyping and marker-assisted selection in plants  <cit> . recently, hirakawa et al.  <cit>  reported a list of snps in the it genome. in the current study, we identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  indels between ib and it. in addition,  <dig>  and  <dig>  indels were identified within orthologs between ib and it, respectively. within paralogs,  <dig> and  <dig> indels were identified in ib and it, respectively . a list of indels is provided in additional file  <dig> for ib and additional file  <dig> for it.table  <dig> number of snps and indels predicted between ib and it

CONCLUSIONS
we compared the root transcriptomes of sr forming cultivated i. batatas with its non-tuber-forming wild ancestor, i. trifida. among paralogous gene sets, genes encoding rgl proteins were identified only in ib; we speculate that rgl family proteins may play a role in sr formation in sweetpotato. in addition to the expression of the transcription factor rwp-rk domain-containing protein in ib, other genes that are expressed in ib, such as those encoding k+ transporters and erecta protein kinases, may also play a role in sr formation. qrt-pcr indicated that starch and sucrose metabolism genes such as those encoding adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase, beta-amylase, and starch synthase, showed enhanced expression in ib. by contrast, lignin biosynthetic genes, such as cad and comt, were highly expressed in it than ib. the root transcriptome data obtained in this study may serve as a resource for the development of molecular markers in sweetpotato and may facilitate annotation of the sweetpotato genome.
