BACKGROUND
botrytis cinerea, a necrotrophic fungus causing gray mold disease, caused by botrytis cinerea is considered an important pathogen around throughout the world. it induces decay on in a large number of economically important fruits and vegetables during the growing season and during postharvest storage. it is also a majorcreating serious obstacle problem to in long- distance transport and storage  <cit> . b. cinerea infection leads to annual losses of  <dig> to  <dig> billion us dollars worldwide  <cit> . necrotrophs kill their host cells by secreting toxic compounds or lytic enzymes; they also produce an array of pathogenic factors that can subdue host defenses  <cit> . to limit the spread of pathogens, host cells generate signaling molecules to initiate defense mechanisms in the surrounding cells. abscisic acid and ethylene are plant hormones that participate in this process  <cit> . li et al.  <cit>  have found that slmkk <dig> and slmkk <dig> contribute to the resistance to b. cinerea in tomato. however, despite extensive research efforts, the biochemical and genetic basis of plant resistance to b. cinerea remains poorly understood.

srnas are non-coding small rnas , approximately 21– <dig> nt in length. these rnas induce gene silencing by binding to argonaute  proteins and directing the rna-induced silencing complex  to the genes with complementary sequences. the plant mirnas are a well-studied class of srnas; they are hypersensitive to abiotic or biotic stresses and various physiological processes  <cit> . mir <dig> participates in bacterial pamp-triggered immunity  by repressing auxin signaling  <cit> . in arabidopsis plants treated with flg <dig>  mir <dig> transcription is induced and the mrnas of mir <dig> targets, including three f-box auxin receptors, namely transport inhibitor response  <dig> , auxin signaling f-box protein  <dig> , and afb <dig>  are downregulated. consequently, the resistance to pseudomonas syringae, a bacterial plant pathogen, is increased  <cit> . mirnas are also directly involved in the regulation of disease resistance  genes  <cit> . for example, nta-mir <dig> and nta-mir <dig> are implicated in the regulation of disease resistance in nicotiana benthamiana by controlling the expression of the n gene. this gene encodes a toll and interleukin- <dig> receptor type of nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich-repeat receptor protein that provides resistance to the tobacco mosaic virus  <cit> . the members of different r-gene families in tomato, potato, soybean, and medicago truncatula are targeted by mir <dig> and mir <dig> mirnas  <cit> . in addition, pathogen srna can also suppress the host immunity by loading into ago <dig> and cause enhanced susceptibility to b. cinerea  <cit> .

tomato , a widespread member of the solanum species, is an economically important vegetable crop worldwide. several mirnas can respond to b. cinerea infection in tomato  <cit> . to investigate the function of mirnas in the resistance to this pathogen, we constructed two srna libraries from mock- and b. cinerea-inoculated tomato leaves. these libraries were then sequenced using an illumina solexa system. this study was conducted to identify and validate b. cinerea-responsive mirnas from tomato leaves. the outcome of this study could enhance our understanding of the mirna-mediated regulatory networks that respond to fungal infection in tomato; it could also provide new gene resources to develop resistant breeds.

RESULTS
deep sequencing of srnas in tomato
to identify mirnas that respond to b. cinerea infection, two srna libraries were constructed from b. cinerea-inoculated  and mock-inoculated  tomato leaves at  <dig> days post-inoculation . the libraries were sequenced using an illumina solexa analyzer in beijing genomics institute  and the sequences have been deposited in the ncbi short read archive  with the accession number srp <dig>  we generated  <dig>  million raw reads from the two srna libraries. after removing low-quality tags and adaptor contaminations, we obtained  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  clean reads, ranging from  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt, from tc7d and td7d libraries, respectively . most reads  had at least  <dig> perfect match with the tomato genome .table  <dig>

the majority of srna reads were from  <dig> nt- to  <dig> nt-long. sequences with 21-nt and 24-nt lengths were dominant in both libraries . the most abundant srnas were  <dig> nt in length, accounting for  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the total sequence reads. our results are consistent with those of previous studies using other plant species such as arabidopsis  <cit> , oryza  <cit> , medicago  <cit> , and populus  <cit> . moreover, the ratios of the tags differed significantly between the two libraries. the relative abundances of 24-nt srnas in the td7d library were markedly lower than those in the tc7d library; this result suggested that the 24-nt srna classes are repressed by b. cinerea infection. nevertheless, the abundance of 21-nt mirnas was evidently higher in the td7d library than in the tc7d library, suggesting that the 21-nt mirna classes are implicated in the response to b. cinerea infection. the proportions of common and specific srnas in both the libraries were further analyzed. among the analyzed srnas,  <dig> % srnas common to both libraries;  <dig> % and  <dig> % were specific to tc7d and td7d libraries, respectively . however, opposite results were obtained for unique srnas; in particular, the proportions of specific sequences were larger than those of common sequences. only  <dig> % was common to both the libraries; moreover,  <dig> % and  <dig> % were specific to tc7d and td7d libraries, respectively . these results suggested that the expression of unique srnas was altered by b. cinerea infection.figure  <dig>

identification of known mirna families in tomato
based on unique srna sequences mapped to mirbase, release  <dig>   <cit> , with perfect matches and a minimum of  <dig> read counts, we identified  <dig> unique sequences belonging to  <dig> conserved mirna families in tc7d and td7d libraries, with total abundances of  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads per million , respectively . among the conserved mirna families,  <dig> families  consisted of more than  <dig> members. in contrast, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> contained only one member each. moreover,  <dig> unique sequences from the  <dig> non-conserved mirna families  were detected in tc7d and td7d libraries. for instance, mir <dig> has been found only in physcomitrella patens  <cit> . the majority of non-conserved mirna families had only one member each; three mirna families  contained two members  each.table  <dig>

read counts differed drastically among the  <dig> known mirna families. a few conserved mirna families such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> showed high expression levels  in both the libraries. the most abundantly expressed mirna family was mir <dig> with  <dig>   and  <dig>   rpm, accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all the conserved mirna reads, respectively. mir <dig> was the second most abundant mirna family in both the libraries. several mirna families, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  were moderately abundant . nevertheless, the most non-conserved mirna families such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> showed relatively low expression levels  in tc7d and td7d libraries . moreover, different members of the same mirna family displayed significantly different expression levels . for instance, the abundance of mir <dig> members varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  reads. these results demonstrated that the expression levels of conserved and non-conserved mirnas varied dramatically in tomato. the results were consistent with those of previous studies, which showed that non-conserved mirnas have lower expression levels than conserved mirnas  <cit> .figure  <dig>

identification of novel mirna in tomato
to search for novel mirnas, we excluded srna reads homologous to known mirnas and other non-coding srnas  and analyzed the secondary structures of the precursors of the remaining 20-nt to 22-nt srnas using rnafold program. the precursors with canonical stem–loop structures were further analyzed using a series of stringent filter strategies to ensure that they satisfied the common criteria established by the research community  <cit> . we obtained  <dig> mirna candidates derived from  <dig> loci, which satisfied the screening criteria. among those candidates, seven contained mirna-star  sequences identified from the same libraries;  <dig> candidates did not contain any identified mirna* . we considered the seven candidates with mirna* sequences to be novel tomato mirnas and the  <dig> remaining candidates without mirna* sequences to be potential tomato mirnas. the secondary structures and srna mapping information of the seven novel mirna precursors are shown in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  gel blot analysis was performed to validate the seven mirnas and determine their expression patterns. mirn <dig> had no signal; this was possibly caused by a very low expression in tomato leaves or false-positive results in srna sequencing. the six remaining candidates were identified as mirnas expressed in tomato leaves . in agreement with the srna sequencing data, gel blot results showed that mirn <dig> was upregulated in b. cinerea-infected leaves.figure  <dig>

to validate and functionally identify these six mirnas, cleaved targets were detected using cleaveland pipeline. abundance of the sequences was plotted for each transcript . we found  <dig> cdna targets for five mirnas  but none for mirn <dig>  there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> targets in categories  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . these findings further validated mirn <dig>  mirn <dig>  mirn4- <dig>  mirn <dig>  and mirn <dig> as novel mirnas expressed in tomato leaves. mirn <dig> may target the pathogenesis-related transcriptional factor, indicating that it may be a b. cinerea-responsive mirna. in addition, a total of  <dig> targets  were selected for cleavage analysis through 5′ rlm-race . the results showed that pathogenesis-related transcriptional factor , ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase , cytokinin riboside 5′-monophosphate phosphoribohydrolase log  and xanthine oxidase  were targeted by mirn <dig>  mirn <dig>  mirn <dig> and mirn <dig>  respectively . the cleavage sites were not found at the expected positions in the seven remaining targets. these results indicated that the four novel mirnas  would cleave the targets to regulate their expression.table  <dig>

identification of b. cinerea-responsive mirnas in tomato
to determine which of the known mirnas respond to b. cinerea, we retrieved the read counts of the  <dig> unique sequences from  <dig> known mirna families from both the libraries; we then normalized these sequences to characterize b. cinerea-responsive mirnas . we identified  <dig> known mirnas  that were differentially expressed in response to b. cinerea stress . among these differentially expressed mirnas,  <dig> were upregulated and  <dig> were downregulated in the td7d library in comparison with the tc7d library. the abundances of  <dig> mirna families or the sum of read counts in each mirna family was calculated and used in differential expression analysis; the results are presented in table  <dig>  we found that  <dig> mirna families were differentially expressed in b. cinerea-infected leaves. seven families, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  were upregulated and only  <dig> family, mir <dig>  was downregulated in b. cinerea-infected leaves. thus, the majority of b. cinerea-responsive mirnas or families were upregulated in the td7d library in comparison with the tc7d library, suggesting that the upregulation of mirnas is involved in plant responses to b. cinerea infection.

dynamic expression of b. cinerea-responsive mirna
we also confirmed the solexa sequencing results and evaluated the dynamic expression patterns of b. cinerea-responsive mirnas at different times after b. cinerea-inoculation . we examined the expression patterns by subjecting  <dig> b. cinerea-responsive mirnas, including  <dig> known mirnas  and  <dig> novel mirna , to quantitative reverse-transcription pcr  . the student’s t-test was performed and the probability values of p <  <dig>  were considered significant. consistently with srna sequencing data, qrt-pcr results showed that  <dig> mirnas, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mirn <dig>  were upregulated at each examined time point after b. cinerea inoculation. the expression of the first  <dig> mirnas increased gradually. in contrast, mirn <dig> was rapidly upregulated and reached the maximum expression at  <dig>  days. mir <dig> and mir <dig>  were downregulated; however, no significant differential expression in b. cinerea-inoculated leaves was observed for mir <dig> . these results are consistent with previous data reported by weiberg et al.  <cit> . therefore, these mirnas, except for mir <dig>  may be involved in the response to b. cinerea infection in tomato leaves.figure  <dig>

the expression profiles of the b. cinerea-responsive mirna targets
cleaveland pipeline was performed to predict the targets of the seven known b. cinerea-responsive mirnas , thereby detecting the expression profiles of their target genes. the results showed that the seven known mirnas targeted  <dig> cds targets . the psrnatarget program was used for the second screening of the targets, only  <dig> cdss were targeted by  <dig> known mirnas, namely mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> . moreover, no cds was predicted as a target of the remaining three mirnas, namely mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  the expression profiles of these nine target cdss and solyc03g <dig> . <dig> were determined using qrt-pcr at different times  after the inoculation of b. cinerea. the result showed in figure  <dig>  two members of the tcp transcriptional factor family , an f-box protein  and a pathogenesis-related transcriptional factor , which were targeted by mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mirn <dig>  respectively, were significantly downregulated in b. cinerea-inoculated leaves at different times , and exhibited a negative relationship to the expression of the  <dig> mirnas . however, a myb transcriptional factor , which was targeted by mir <dig>  was significantly upregulated and exhibited a consistent expression pattern with that of mir <dig>  in addition, no significant differential expression in b. cinerea-inoculated leaves was observed in the remaining five target cdss . therefore, the results strongly suggested that the mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mirn <dig> may be involved in the responses to b. cinerea infection in tomato leaves.figure  <dig>

discussion
mirnas have been found as post-transcriptional regulators in many eukaryotic plants and are involved in the response to various environmental stresses  <cit> . to identify tomato mirnas associated with the resistance to b. cinerea, we performed high-throughput sequencing of td7d and tc7d libraries constructed from b. cinerea- and mock-inoculated tomato leaves, respectively. the results showed substantially higher abundance of 21-nt mirnas in the td7d library than in the tc7d library, indicating that the upregulation of the 21-nt mirna classes may be important in the response to b. cinerea infection. the relative abundances of 24-nt srnas in the td7d library were markedly lower than those in the tc7d library. plant 24-nt small interfering rnas  are mostly derived from repeats and transposons. these 24-nt sirnas trigger dna methylation at all cg, chg, and chh  sites, resulting in h3k9me <dig> modifications  <cit> . these modifications reinforce transcriptional silencing of transposons and genes that harbor or are adjacent to repeats or transposons in arabidopsis  <cit> . in this study, the decreased number of 24-nt srnas in td7d library suggested that the levels of dna methylation at some specific loci are reduced in response to b. cinerea infection. we could reasonably assume that the reduced dna methylation exposes some host genes, which could enhance the resistance or susceptibility to b. cinerea infection. further research will be necessary to prove these assumptions.

in this study,  <dig> known mirnas from  <dig> families were differentially expressed in the response to b. cinerea stress . among these differentially expressed mirnas,  <dig> were upregulated and  <dig> were downregulated in the td7d library compared with those in the tc7d library. we compared the expression profiles of these  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas with the published data on b. cinerea-infected tomato leaves at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h after inoculation  <cit> . a total of  <dig> mirnas presented low read counts  in the three libraries . the total read count in each of tc7d and td7d was approximately two to the three times higher than that in the three libraries. most of the  <dig> mirnas presented lower read counts than the  <dig> mirnas in the present study. among the remaining  <dig> mirnas, most differentially expressed mirnas also showed consistent expression profiles between our data and the reported data .figure  <dig>

we obtained  <dig> novel mirna candidates derived from  <dig> loci, which satisfied the screening criteria. seven of these novel mirna candidates contained mirna* sequences identified from the same libraries, whereas  <dig> candidates did not contain any identified mirna* sequences . we performed a gel blot analysis to validate these seven novel mirnas and determine their expression patterns. mirn <dig> was not expressed, but mirn <dig> was expressed in mock- and b. cinerea-infected leaves . this finding is inconsistent with the srna-seq data, in which mirn <dig> exhibited higher read count than mirn <dig> . we speculated that few mirnas may show inconsistent abundance values when examined using two different methods, i.e., northern blot and srna-seq.

mir <dig> is a conserved mirna that mediates the changes in plant morphology  <cit> . some microarray data suggest that this mirna is also involved in plant responses to drought and salinity stress; transgenic plants of creeping bentgrass  with an overexpressed rice mir <dig> gene have enhanced resistance to drought and salt stress  <cit> . our results showed that transient overexpression of mir <dig> may increase the resistance of tomato plants to b. cinerea.

mir <dig> is a conserved mirna found in several plant species  <cit> . liu et al.  <cit>  have found that high salinity upregulates the expression of mir <dig> in arabidopsis. the expression of mir394b in roots and mir394a and mir394b in shoots is initially upregulated and then downregulated under iron-deficient conditions  <cit> . in brassica napus, mir394a, b, and c are upregulated in the roots and stems under sulfate-deficient conditions  <cit> . similarly, the expression of mir394a, b, and c in all plant tissues is induced by cadmium treatment  <cit> . song et al.  <cit>  have reported that mir <dig> and its target, the f-box gene at1g <dig>  are involved in the regulation of leaf curling-related morphology of arabidopsis. the available data suggest that mir <dig> is involved in the development and abiotic stress regulation. furthermore, transgenic plants overexpressing the arabidopsis mir319a gene may have enhanced drought resistance but diminished salt tolerance  <cit> . in this study, we found that the transient overexpression of mir <dig> may also increase the resistance of tomato leaves to b. cinerea.

CONCLUSIONS
this study was the first to perform a genome-wide identification of mirnas involved in resistance against b. cinerea by using srna sequencing and transient overexpression in tomato leaves. we identified  <dig> mirnas, including  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirnas, by using the high-throughput sequencing data of b. cinerea-infected and mock-infected tomato leaves. among these  <dig> mirnas,  <dig> were differentially expressed in b. cinerea-stressed leaves. our study showed that the upregulated mirnas may play important roles in the response to b. cinerea infection in tomato plants. we also found that that upregulated mirnas inhibited the expression of their targets. hence, these mirnas may be involved in the response to b. cinerea infection in tomato leaves.
