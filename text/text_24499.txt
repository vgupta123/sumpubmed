BACKGROUND
during thermal acclimation, ectotherms can shift their reaction norms by modifying the thermal sensitivities of their metabolic and other physiological pathways. this process can be mediated by changes in enzyme concentrations and mitochondrial biogenesis, modification of cell and mitochondrial membranes, and conformational changes that optimize enzyme efficiencies at different temperatures  <cit> . despite the importance of acclimation for physiology, ecology, and conservation, the overarching mechanisms governing this process in ectotherms remain unknown  <cit> . we hypothesize that thyroid hormone  regulates the thermal-acclimation response. testing this hypothesis is important to understand how animals respond to temperature change. it is also important in an evolutionary context, because the ancestral function of th may have predisposed it for its central regulatory role in the evolution of endothermy.

th has garnered much attention for its roles in metabolic heat production  and energy expenditure  <cit>  in mammals, which could be exploited for the treatment of diseases including obesity, type  <dig> diabetes, and metabolic syndromes  <cit> , but the complexity of the th system is far from resolved. several th metabolites can stimulate physiological responses through a wide range of signaling pathways that are subject to many levels of biological regulation  <cit> . in vertebrates, th is produced in the thyroid gland primarily as thyroxine , and is metabolized to  <dig> ,3′-triiodothyronine  and  <dig> -diiodothyronine  by deiodinase enzymes  in peripheral tissues  <cit> . other th isomers exist, but are either physiologically inactive or have very low activity  <cit> . t <dig> was originally believed to be the only physiologically active th because of its unique affinity for th receptors, which regulate the expression of target genes transcriptionally by binding to thyroid response elements  in their promoters  <cit> . recently, however, t <dig> was also found to stimulate metabolism, but through non-genomic  pathways, which are as yet poorly understood  <cit> . t <dig> acts at different cellular levels  and elicits much quicker responses than t <dig> <cit> . although t <dig> has been shown to stimulate metabolism, its physiological relevance is still in question  <cit> .

th is ubiquitous across all vertebrates  <cit> , and even stimulates growth and development in many invertebrate groups  <cit> . interestingly, th can produce drastically different responses in different animal groups  <cit> . generally, th regulates growth and development in vertebrates and invertebrates, but additionally regulates metabolism and thermogenesis during cold exposure in mammals. however, these functionally distinct roles are underpinned by overlapping physiological and biochemical pathways  <cit> . energy metabolism and its control are highly conserved in vertebrates  <cit> , but it is unknown whether the role of th in mediating thermal responses is independently derived in mammals, or whether it is also present in earlier vertebrates. in all animals, biochemical pathways are sensitive to acute changes in temperature. however, endotherms and many ectotherms regulate, or acclimate, their metabolism to compensate for longer-term  thermal variation in their environments. we hypothesize that, as in endotherms, th regulates these physiological responses of ectotherms to chronic changes in their thermal environment.

specifically, we assessed the metabolic role of th during thermal acclimation in the zebrafish . the zebrafish was chosen as a model because fish occupy an early position in vertebrate evolution, and the zebrafish in particular has become an important biomedical model for thyroid-related disease, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes  <cit> . we used a multi-factorial experimental design in which we induced hypothyroidism, followed by supplementation with t <dig> and t <dig>  in zebrafish exposed to different chronic and acute temperature combinations. we measured whole-animal responses , and determined tissue-specific protein function , metabolic gene expression , and levels of free t <dig> and t <dig> to determine whether th is the mechanism that drives thermal acclimation in ectotherms. we hypothesized that hypothyroidism would impair acclimation responses, and that supplementation with t <dig> and t <dig> would restore acclimation in hypothyroid fish.

RESULTS
thyroid hormone levels
levels of both t <dig> and t <dig> were lower in muscle tissue from cold-acclimated fish . the th levels in cold-acclimated hypothyroid fish supplemented with t <dig> and t <dig> verified that our hypothyroid and supplementation treatments were effective .

effects of cold acclimation
cold acclimation significantly increased sustained swimming performance  at acute test temperatures of both 18°c and 28°c . cold-acclimated fish  compensated for the limiting effect of low temperature, and swam as well at the 18°c acute test temperature as warm-acclimated  fish did at a test temperature of 28°c.

there was no effect of acclimation temperature on resting metabolic rate, but cold acclimation significantly increased active metabolic rate and, hence, metabolic scope . there was a significant increase in maximal lactate dehydrogenase  activity in the cold-acclimated fish, but no effect of acclimation treatment on maximal citrate synthase  or cytochrome c oxidase  activities . cold-acclimation significantly increased transcript levels of the transcriptional coactivators pgc1α and pgc1β, their target transcription factors pparδ, nrf <dig>  and nrf2b, subunits of the mitochondrial enzymes cox , and fof1-atpase  in muscle, and pgc1α, nrf <dig>  nrf2b, cox vb <dig>  atpase a, and atpase b in liver .

the effects of hypothyroid treatment on responses that acclimated
hypothyroid treatment significantly decreased the sustained swim speed in the cold-acclimated fish, but it had no effect on swimming performance in the warm-acclimated fish . hypothyroid treatment significantly decreased active metabolic rate and metabolic scope at both acclimation temperatures . hypothyroid treatment significantly decreased ldh activity in muscle of cold-acclimated fish but it had no effect on warm-acclimated fish . there was also a significant interaction between acclimation treatment and test temperature on the activity of ldh.

paralleling responses of swimming performance and ldh activity, there were significant interactions between hypothyroid treatment and acclimation temperature for transcript levels of pgc1α, cox vb <dig>  cox ii, atpase a, atpase b, and atpase 8/ <dig> in muscle, whereby hypothyroid treatment significantly decreased transcript levels in cold-acclimated fish but had no effect on warm-acclimated fish . there were significant effects of hypothyroid treatment on cox ii and atpase 8/ <dig> in muscle and coxvb <dig> in liver . hypothyroid treatment had no significant effect on transcript levels of pgc1β, pparδ, nrf <dig>  and nrf2b in muscle, or on pgc1α, atpase a, and atpase b in liver . for those genes that responded to acclimation treatments, there was a tendency for hypothyroid treatment to decrease transcript levels in cold-acclimated fish and increase transcript levels in warm-acclimated fish.

the effects of hypothyroid treatment on response measures that did not acclimate
hypothyroidism decreased resting metabolic rate at the 18°c test temperature, but increased resting metabolic rate at the 28°c test temperature . hypothyroid treatment had no significant effect on cs activity or muscle transcript levels for nrf2a . there was a significant interaction between hypothyroid treatment and maximal cox activity, whereby hypothyroidism significantly increased cox activity in muscle of the warm-acclimated fish but had no effect on the cold-acclimated fish .

there were significant interactions between hypothyroid treatment and acclimation temperature for liver transcript levels of pgc1β, pparδ, nrf <dig>  nrf2a, nrf2b, cox vb <dig>  cox ii, and atpase 8/ <dig>  whereby hypothyroidism significantly increased the transcript levels of pgc1β, pparδ, nrf <dig>  nrf2a, and nrf2b in cold-acclimated fish and significantly reduced transcript levels of pgc1β and cox ii in warm-acclimated fish . overall, for those genes that did not respond to acclimation treatments, there was a tendency for hypothyroidism to increase transcript levels in cold-acclimated fish and decrease transcript levels in warm-acclimated fish. this trend was the reverse of the pattern seen in the genes that did respond to thermal acclimation in muscle.

the effects of t <dig> and t <dig> supplementation for responses sensitive to hypothyroid treatment
supplementation of hypothyroid fish with either t <dig> or t <dig> resulted in a significant recovery of sustained swimming performance in cold-acclimated fish at both the 18°c and 28°c test temperatures . there was no significant effect of t <dig> or t <dig> supplementation on resting metabolic rate, but t <dig> supplementation significantly restored active metabolic rate and metabolic scope at both test temperatures . there was a significant effect of t <dig> and t <dig> supplementation on muscle ldh activity, with t <dig> tending to decrease activity levels, and t <dig> increasing activity levels . in muscle, t <dig> supplementation resulted in a significant recovery of transcript levels for pgc1α and cox vb <dig>  whereas t <dig> supplementation resulted in a significant recovery of transcript levels for pgc1α, cox vb <dig>  atpase b, cox ii and atpase 8/ <dig> . in liver, t <dig> or t <dig> supplementation had no significant effect on the transcript levels of any of the genes previously shown to be sensitive to hypothyroid treatment .

discussion
we have shown that th regulates thermal acclimation of metabolism in an ectothermic vertebrate. our principal novel findings were that 1) the actions of th are temperature-specific, and 2) th regulates thermal acclimation in ectotherms. we also showed that 3) t <dig> has a functional role in this thermal response, which, to our knowledge has not been shown in any other system. thus, to our knowledge, this is the first time that an environmental factor as pervasive as temperature has been shown to determine not just the magnitude of a hormone-mediated response, but also the direction.

the traditional model for hormonal regulation is based on homeostatic control  <cit> , by which the bioavailability of a hormone is adjusted to regulate its action. opposing responses are typically mediated by antagonistic hormone pairs  <cit> , but single hormones can also drive different responses depending upon the physiological context  <cit> . in the current study, we identified a novel signaling response, by which th elicits a positive or negative response depending on the actual temperature and thermal history of the animal. th has long been known to act in a tissue-specific manner  <cit> , and it is possible that the same mechanisms that underlie its tissue specificity also underlie its temperature specificity. phenotypic differences between tissues are primarily driven by differential patterns in gene expression defined during ontogeny  <cit> , but gene-expression patterns, and therefore tissue phenotypes, are plastic, and can be adjusted in response to environmental factors such as temperature  <cit> . thus, the thermal-acclimation response may change the tissue phenotype temporally to alter sensitivity to th in a way that may parallel how different tissue types respond to th.

the temperature specificity of th action is evident at multiple levels of physiological organization, and mediates performance functions that determine fitness. we have shown that th regulates energy metabolism and locomotor performance in response to chronic exposure to cold. this is the first time, to our knowledge, that a central regulator of thermal acclimation has been identified in an ectotherm, and provides a model that could explain vertebrate radiation during thermal-niche expansion. th appears to have evolved as an environmental signaling molecule prior to vertebrate evolution  <cit> . in many invertebrates, th suppresses larval structures, and promotes the growth and development of the juvenile rudiment  <cit> . although many of these animals require exogenous ths ingested from food, others can synthesize ths or th-like compounds endogenously  <cit> . it is interesting to note that in echinoderms, endogenously synthesized th has been suggested to be a derived trait  <cit> . growth and developmental rates are intrinsically linked to energy metabolism, and it is therefore likely that th has always regulated these processes, at least in part by regulating metabolism. it is unknown whether the temperature specificity of th is conserved in invertebrates, but it is conceivable that th pathways evolved their sensitivity to temperature because both play such major roles in development  <cit> . if th regulated metabolism to promote development at thermally challenging temperatures, then selection could favor this additional role. with an endogenous store of th in the form of the thyroid gland, vertebrates could regulate these responses autonomously, and exploit novel thermal environments while maintaining important performance parameters such as locomotor capacity.

the properties that underlie the role of th in thermal acclimation, temperature sensitivity, and metabolic control may have predisposed this hormone for a regulatory role in the evolution of endothermy. of the response variables related to cold acclimation that we measured, most were highly sensitive to th. the genes that were upregulated by th during cold acclimation in zebrafish are homologous to those that control mammalian thermogenesis. in mammals, th modulates the transcriptional regulation of metabolism by controlling expression levels of pgc1α  <cit> , which plays a master role in coordinating the cross-genome expression of transcription factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and proteins that drive oxidative metabolism, including cox and f0f1-atpase  <cit> . our findings show that this same pathway underlies cold acclimation in an ectotherm. the most parsimonious explanation is that these pathways were conserved in early vertebrate ancestors; however, without similar analyses of other ectotherms, we cannot preclude the possibility that they were independently derived in both fish and mammals. pgc1α has also been shown to adjust skeletal muscle phenotype in ways that affect locomotion  <cit> . as is the case in mammals, pgc1α appears to be conserved as a target of th in zebrafish, and probably also in other ectotherms. with the same pathways underlying both processes, the evolution of thermogenesis in mammals and birds  <cit>  may have already been pre-programmed as a component of the cold-acclimation response in ectotherms.

t <dig> is often considered to be the only th capable of genomic action because of its unique affinity for thyroid receptors  <cit> . however, t <dig> has recently been shown to stimulate metabolism in mammals and fish  <cit> . our work supports the notion that t <dig> is also an important transcriptional regulator  <cit> . in many cases, t <dig> was just as effective as, if not more effective than, t <dig> at regulating the transcription of metabolic genes. although t <dig> has poor affinity for thyroid receptors, it could exert its transcriptional control through cell surface receptors that are also known to respond to th  <cit> , or through reversible epigenetic modifications to histone complexes  <cit> . importantly, the current study shows that t <dig> modulates performance parameters in the whole animal, which means that it is of ecological relevance and probably also of medical relevance. th is associated with many modern lifestyle-induced conditions, and zebrafish have emerged as an important model for human endocrine diseases including obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndromes  <cit> . the fact that t <dig> regulates metabolism and locomotor performance in a manner that is potentially very different from that of t <dig> means that the mechanistic basis of th action is far broader than realized to date. a corollary is that thyroid-related diseases may be more complex, but also that there may be novel avenues for treatments that specifically target t <dig> 

several studies have measured changes in t <dig> and t <dig> plasma levels during thermal response in fish, but the combined results are ambiguous. in the current study we found a high level of variation in t <dig> levels in warm-acclimated euthyroid fish. there was also much variation in the th levels of the fish receiving t <dig> and t <dig> supplement treatments, although all individuals measured had supplementation levels greater than or equal to their euthyroid counterparts. overall, the muscle-specific concentrations of t <dig> and t <dig> in our study decreased drastically with cold acclimation, when their effects were most pronounced. however, th concentrations alone do not indicate the bioavailability and/or bioactivity of the hormone within the target tissue. instead, the action of th is modulated by downstream regulators, which include plasma distributor proteins, th transporters, deiodinase enzymes, intracellular reservoir proteins, target proteins , and transcriptional regulators  <cit> . the actions of th may be more sensitive to changes in these downstream regulatory elements than to absolute free th levels.

in many cases, the warm-acclimated zebrafish were far less sensitive to th than cold-acclimated fish. this was especially evident in measures of locomotor performance. decreased responsiveness to th at warmer temperatures suggests that chronic increases in temperature, such as those brought about by global warming, will reduce the capacity of animals to adjust to environmental variation. chronic warming could conceivably alter tissue phenotypes in ways that dampen, or reverse, th-mediated response. this would interfere with th as an environmental signaling molecule, and would compromise its crucial role in ectotherm growth and development. importantly, many aquatic pollutants found worldwide, such as dioxins, bisphenol a, and phthalates, are thyroid-disrupting chemicals  and bioaccumulate higher up the food chain  <cit> . our findings indicate that the toxic effects of these chemicals may be temperature-specific, which is of crucial importance to the ecological influence of these pollutants. together, climate change and rising levels of global pollution may amplify these risks. warming temperatures are likely to result in higher concentrations, longer durations, and increased distributions of tdcs throughout the water column  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our finding that the effects of th can depend upon the thermal history of an animal means that the toxicities of thyroid-disrupting pollutants, levels of which are increasing on a global basis, may vary with temperature. a corollary of this is that toxicological assessments of tdcs should consider the natural range of temperatures that a species experiences, or is predicted to experience in future. we show that th is an important regulator of thermal acclimation in an ectotherm, which gives a new perspective on the evolution of thermal plasticity because it would be closely tied to the evolutionary history of the thyroid system. it is not known whether the role of th in mediating thermal responses is conserved evolutionarily, or whether it is derived independently in mammals and earlier vertebrates. based on our findings, we propose that the role of th in thermal acclimation of fish predisposed it to evolve for regulatory control of thermogenesis. decades of th research have focused almost exclusively on t <dig>  but the current study shows that that t <dig> also stimulates physiological activities that are of biological importance. little is known about t <dig> signaling mechanisms, but the fact that it influences whole-animal performance independently from t <dig> suggests that it is important in both ecological and medical contexts.
