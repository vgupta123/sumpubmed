BACKGROUND
embryonic stem  cells are pluripotent cells derived from the inner cell mass of blastocyst-stage embryos  <cit> . the abilities of es cells to undergo indefinite self-renewal in vitro and to produce derivative lineages of all three embryonic germ layers in vitro and in vivo make them highly prized in both clinical and research settings  <cit> . es, or es-like, cells have thus far been derived from a number of mammalian species, including the mouse  <cit> , rat  <cit> , bovine  <cit> , sheep  <cit> , pig  <cit> , rhesus macaque  <cit> , crab-eating macaque  <cit> , marmoset  <cit>  and human  <cit> .

apodemus sylvaticus is a common rodent species found throughout europe. a. sylvaticus has a gross appearance similar to that of the laboratory mouse. the rearing conditions are also quite similar to those of the mouse. however, the superficial resemblance between a. sylvaticus and the laboratory mouse belies the rather deep evolutionary divide separating these two species. the combination of these properties--that is, the similar rearing conditions and large evolutionary divergence--makes a. sylvaticus highly attractive as a potential model organism that could perhaps complement the mouse in many studies. unlike the mouse, however, there is a dearth of knowledge and reagents related to a. sylvaticus. one major step in filling this gap is the generation of es cells for this species. recently, we reported the successful establishment of an es cell line from a. sylvaticus  <cit> , named as-es <dig> cells. this cell line has proliferated continuously for over  <dig> months with a normal karyotype. it expresses a variety of markers associated with the undifferentiated state and has the ability to produce lineages of all three germ layers in vitro and in vivo. however, there are some characteristic differences between as-es <dig> and mouse es cells. for example, as-es <dig> cells do not express stage specific embryonic antigen- <dig> , whereas mouse es cells do. furthermore, the as-es <dig> cell line proliferates faster than specific mouse es cell lines. therefore, as a new species of es cell line, the basic characteristics of as-es <dig> cells need to be studied further, including specific lineage differentiation.

mouse es cells were first established in  <dig>  since then, many studies have been carried out regarding the three lineages differentiation of mouse es cells in vitro. for mesodermal differentiation of mouse es cells in vitro, different research groups have generated a variety of cell types, such as adipocytes  <cit> , osteoblasts  <cit> , chondrocytes  <cit>  and cardiomyocytes  <cit> , among others. through this research, some pivotal agents that play an important role in the process of mesodermal differentiation of mouse es cells have been discovered. however, it was not known whether those agents and differentiation methods could work with as-es <dig> cells.

herein we report that as-es <dig> cells treated with retinoic acid  or 5-azacytidine  at the embryoid body  stage, with the addition of various specific factors and reagents to the medium during eb attachment, generated multiple mesodermal lineages in vitro, including adipocytes, osteoblasts, chondrocytes and cardiomyocytes.

RESULTS
as-es <dig> cells maintained their undifferentiated state and generated embryoid bodies  in vitro
as-es <dig> cells maintained their undifferentiated state when cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblast  cells. the es clones had a dome-like shape with smooth and clearly defined borders . the es cells between p <dig> and p <dig> were dissociated to single cells for forming ebs. after hanging drop culture for  <dig> days, 80% of the es cell clumps began to organize into three-dimensional aggregates. after  <dig> days of culture, the aggregates grew into spherical eb-like structures with a uniform size and central transparency .

as-es <dig> cells were capable of in vitro adipogenesis, osteogenesis and chondrogenesis
adipocytes, osteoblasts and chondrocytes derived from as-es <dig> cells emerged in eb outgrowths following in vitro differentiation. adipocytes contain lipid droplets that can be easily visualized with oil red o staining. eb outgrowth cells stained with oil red o were observed as a large adipocyte colony that developed in the outgrowth of the aggregate . calcium deposition, detected by alizarin red, also occurred in eb outgrowth areas . these calcium nodules are secreted by osteoblasts. light- to dark-red/purple regions became noticeable within the outgrowth cells with toluidine blue staining. this is indicative of cartilage-like extracellular matrix accumulation. the cartilage nodules consisted of well separated round cells, and large extracellular spaces were stained metachromatically with toluidine blue . to further confirm chondrogenesis, eb outgrowths were stained with an anti-collagen iiantibody. the extracellular matrix positively expressed collagen ii .

the percentage of positive cells stained by oil red o, alizarin red, toluidine blue or anti-collagen iiantibody differed. the proportion of positive cells in chondrogenesis was the greatest , whereas the proportion of positive cells in adipogenesis  was similar to that in osteogenesis .

expression of specific genes for adipogenesis, osteogenesis and chondrogenesis was investigated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  . we analyzed expression levels for genes including the adipocyte lipid binding protein , peroxisome proliferative-activated receptor γ <dig> , ccaat/enhancer binding protein α , runx <dig>  osteopontin, sox <dig> and col2a <dig>  rt-pcr of β-actin and undifferentiated as-es <dig> cells were included as positive and negative controls, respectively.

generation of cardiomyocytes by as-es <dig> cells
besides adipocyte, osteoblast and chondrocyte generation, under cardiomyocyte differentiation conditions beating cells were observed in eb outgrowths as early as  <dig> days after plating. as differentiation proceeded, more and more beating cells could be observed by microscopy . twenty-one days after plating, we performed immunostaining for cardiac muscle markers. as-es <dig> cell-derived cardiomyocytes were positively stained with anti-desmin , anti-sarcomeric α-actinin , anti-cardiac myosin heavy chain   and anti-cardiac troponin i  antibodies. the cardiomyocytes exhibited striations and staining patterns of cytoplasmic localization that are characteristic of the sarcomeric organization of muscle cells. the numbers of positive cells stained by the four antibodies were analyzed. the proportions were as follows: anti-desmin antibody,  <dig>  ±  <dig> %; anti-sarcomeric α-actinin antibody,  <dig>  ±  <dig> %; anti-mhc antibody,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and anti-cardiac troponin i antibody,  <dig>  ±  <dig> %. expression of other cardiac markers gata- <dig> and β-myosin heavy chain  was also determined by rt-pcr .

discussion
in our previous research, as-es <dig> cells spontaneously differentiated into cells of three germ lineages in vitro and produced healthy chimeras bearing extensive contributions in all major organs  <cit> . as a new es cell line, as-es <dig> cells require more experimentation to discover their features. in this paper, we focused on the formation of specific mesodermal cells, derived from as-es <dig> cells, cultured with various factors and reagents in vitro, including dexamethasone, β-glycerophosphate, ascorbic acid, insulin and transforming growth factor  β <dig> 

first, we treated ebs of as-es <dig> cells with ra for  <dig> days, which was previously reported to induce the development of mesenchymal cell lineages from mouse es cells  <cit> . the distinctive effect of ra on es cell differentiation is uncertain. it was reported that ra enhances neural crest generation, a major source of mesenchymal elements in ra-treated ebs, but not mesoderm development directly, to drive the formation of mesodermal type cells  <cit> . however, ra suppresses cardiomyocyte formation  <cit> . thus, 5-aza, which has previously been employed for the formation of cardiomyocytes derived from es cells  <cit> , was used to replace ra for cardiomyocyte differentiation in this study.

after eb formation, during the eb attachment stage, various factors and reagents, such as dexamethasone, β-glycerophosphate and tgfβ <dig>  have been used to enhance differentiation. these factors and reagents were important elements for mesoderm differentiation of mouse es cells into adipocytes, osteoblasts or other types of mesodermal cells  <cit> . in our experiment, we obtained four types of mesodermal cells separately by applying similar factors and reagents. with cardiomyocyte differentiation, we preferred a simple compound, ascorbic acid, rather than 5-aza, because of 5-aza cytotoxicity. the takahashi group  <cit>  screened a broad range of compounds and determined that ascorbic acid markedly increased the efficiency of cardiac differentiation from mouse es cells. in addition, sato's group  <cit>  demonstrated that ascorbic acid enhanced the differentiation of es cells into cardiomyocytes through collagen synthesis. from quantitative data, we could estimate that the yield of the four cell types--adipocytes, osteoblasts, chondrocytes and cardiomyocytes--was 10-30% of the total cell number. the proportions were similar to those of the four cell types derived from mouse es cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that as-es <dig> cells could be induced to differentiate into mesodermal lineages by a combination of growth factors and chemicals and provides more information to further understand the differentiation characteristics of as-es <dig> cells.
