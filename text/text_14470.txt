BACKGROUND
the rna polymerase  core enzyme  for bacterial transcription is a catalytic multi-subunit complex , capable of transcribing portions of the dna template into rna transcripts. at the beginning of the transcribing process, the rnap core enzyme requires a σ-factor to recognize the genomic location at which the process initiates  <cit>  . then σ-factor, a single dissociable subunit, binds to e, forming a holoenzyme  and orchestrates initiation of promoter-specific transcription  <cit> . to date, one housekeeping σ-factor σ <dig>  and six alternative σ-factors σ <dig>  σ <dig>  σ <dig>  σ <dig>  σ <dig>  and σ <dig>  have been described in escherichia coli. although the importance of σ-factors and their role in the function of the rnap and bacterial transcription are well known, we do not yet have a genome-wide understanding of the network of regulatory interactions that the σ-factors comprise in any species. with systems biology and genome-scale science emerging and describing the phenotypic functions of bacteria, it is now possible to comprehensively elucidate the structure of the σ-factor network. here, we present the results from a systems approach that integrates multiple genome-scale measurements to reconstruct the regulatory network of σ-factor-gene interactions in e. coli. this reconstruction is provided here as a resource for the scientific community.

RESULTS
determination of the genome-wide map of holoenzyme binding
to capture the first step of the transcription cycle, which is the formation of the eσx-promoter complex, we obtained genome-wide location profiles and integrated the identified rnap and σ-factor binding sites, leading to a reconstruction of a genome-scale eσ-binding region map . a genome-wide static map of the entire group of eσx-binding sites  was determined by employing chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray  of rifampicin-treated cells , revealing the active promoter regions in vivo across the e. coli genome  <cit>  . a total of  <dig>  eσx-binding regions were identified, consisting of  <dig>  for the leading strand,  <dig>  for the lagging strand, and  <dig>  for both strands  .

although the construction of the eσx map is informative, it is not sufficient to produce the σ-specific eσ-binding map, in which the promoter-specific role of the σ-factor is detailed  <cit> . we thus deployed chip-chip assays for the direct identification of the locations of σ-factor binding across the e. coli genome. we analyzed e. coli cells grown to mid-logarithmic phase or to stationary phase under multiple growth conditions . using data from biological duplicate or triplicate experiments for each σ-factor chip-chip , we identified  <dig>  targets for σ <dig>   <dig> targets for σ <dig>   <dig> targets for σ <dig>   <dig> targets for σ <dig>   <dig> targets for σ <dig>  and  <dig> targets for σ <dig> . we were not able to obtain dataset for σ <dig>  and the missing dataset was supplemented by incorporating  <dig> σ <dig> promoter regions from regulondb  <cit> . for validation, we compared the σ-factor binding regions with the previously reported promoters regulated by each σ-factor  <cit>  . overall, we identified 86% of the previously reported binding sites and  <dig>  new σ-factor binding regions, extending the current knowledge by over 300% .

by integrating the entire eσx and σ-factor binding regions, we obtained the genome-wide eσ-binding region map  comprising  <dig>  binding regions . next, each eσ-binding site was classified into one of three categories depending on the number of σ-factors recruited to that site: single eσ-binding promoter region , overlapped eσ-binding promoter region , and intensively overlapped eσ-binding promoter region  . for instance, all σ-factors except σ <dig> were detected at the promoter region of the rpod gene, which encodes σ70; however, only σ <dig> was found to bind to the promoter region of the fecabcde operon, which encodes the ferric citrate outer membrane receptor and the ferric citrate atp-binding cassette  transporter . over 48% of eσ-binding regions identified in this study were overlapped or extensively overlapped binding regions, indicating that eσ switching, or binding of alternative eσ, at the same promoter region may be needed to ensure continued gene expression in response to environmental changes  <cit>  .

determination of the genome-wide promoter map
we found that 69% of the eσ-binding regions exhibited strand specificity, with the balance being observed as divergent promoter regions . although the assignment of the rnap-binding regions to each strand was achievable using the expression profiles  <cit> , it was difficult to assign σ-factors directly to the promoter regions because information on the cis-acting sequence elements, such as the − <dig> and − <dig> boxes in the promoter regions, is not yet fully elucidated for each σ-factor. to identify the promoter elements more precisely with strand specificity and a better resolution than chip-chip, we performed transcription start site  profiling at the genome scale with a single nucleotide resolution. a genome-wide tss map was generated from tss profiling by rapid amplification of cdna ends  followed by deep sequencing after 5′ triphosphate enrichment  <cit>  for three conditions: stationary phase, heat shock, and alternative nitrogen source with glutamine. tss profiling for exponential phase was taken from a previous study  <cit> , and processed together with the other three datasets. the tss map was then integrated with the eσ map to build a strand-specific promoter map  .

reconstruction of sigma factor regulons and their overlaps
the p map was combined with the transcription unit  map  <cit> , resulting in the σ-factor-tu gene  network . a network of interactions between the σ-factors was extracted from the σ-tug network . σ <dig> and σ <dig> are the only σ-factors that auto-regulate themselves, and σ <dig> and σ <dig> regulate most of the other σ-factors, reflecting their roles as housekeeping σ-factors in exponential and stationary phase  <cit> . gene essentiality data are available for e. coli <cit> , and only rpod has been found to be an essential σ-factor. this network feature is consistent with the fact that σ <dig> regulates the highest number of σ-factors, including itself. in addition, σ <dig> has the largest regulon, and this cannot be replaced by the other σ-factors .

the significant overlap of σ-factor regulons leads to the fundamental questions: what is the molecular basis for the overlap, and what are the consequences of having a complicated σ-factor network? because each σ-factor has an individual ability to recognize cis-acting sequence elements in the promoter region , we analyzed the sequence motifs of the promoter regions . as in previous studies  <cit> , the sequence motifs of σ <dig> and σ <dig> were found to have a similar − <dig> box sequence ; however, unlike the σ <dig> sequence motif, σ <dig> did not have a distinctive − <dig> box. the similarity in the − <dig> box sequence motifs of the σ70- and σ38-specific promoters and the degenerate nature of the − <dig> box sequence of the σ38-specific promoters explains, in part, how a large overlap between σ <dig> and σ <dig> regulons is possible.

with the structure and molecular details of the σ-tug network in hand, we were able to study its functional states. because of the limited number of e complexes in a growing e. coli cell  <cit> , each σ-factor should compete to achieve association with an e complex to initiate transcription. thus, it becomes important which factor eσx binds, and how frequently it does so  <cit> . we found that the promoter sets specific to each σ-factor overlap extensively, and a large number of promoters bound by multiple σ-factor share the same tss . these findings raise questions about the molecular mechanism of σ-factor competition for binding to the e complex and subsequently to the promoter, and how that affects transcription initiation.

sigma factor competition in overlapped promoters
σ-factors are believed to act predominantly as positive effectors, as they recognize the cis-acting elements in promoters that enable the eσx to bind. interestingly, however, σ <dig> has a negative effect on the expression level of some genes, even though it acts mainly as a positive effector  <cit> . to shed light on the molecular mechanisms of σ-factor competition by σ <dig>  we performed chip-chip experiments for rpob with wild type  e. coli and its isogenic rpos knock-out strain to obtain differential eσx binding to the genome. the differential binding intensity of the eσx to the promoters of  <dig>  genes, whose transcription is directly affected by σ <dig>  is shown in figure 3a. if σ38-specific promoters were bound only by σ <dig>  then the e complex recruited to those promoters would be very scarce. however, the majority of σ38-specific promoters showed significant levels of signaling for eσx binding in the σ <dig> deletion strain, indicating recruitment of the eσx and implying rescue of transcription activity .

to confirm that the detected binding of the eσx leads to transcription, we performed expression profiling with wt and rpos knock-out strain cells under stationary phase conditions . most genes having σ38-specific promoters were expressed. of  <dig>  genes with σ38-specific promoters,  <dig>  showed up-regulated expression when rpos was removed and  <dig>  showed expression that was down-regulated more than two-fold . the remaining 58% of the genes showed no statistical significance in expression  or were not expressed in either strain. in the absence of rpos, σ38-specific promoters became active in transcription, leading to expression of the corresponding genes, but at a different level for  <dig>  of these  <dig>  genes.

expression of genes with σ38-regulated genes was recovered when rpos was knocked out; however, it is not known which of the other σ-factors is replacing the role of σ <dig>  as σ <dig> shared the largest portion of promoters with σ <dig>  it is reasonable to assume that σ <dig> would replace σ <dig> when σ <dig> is missing. in e. coli mc <dig>  it was reported that the amount of σ <dig> is in abundance during stationary phase  <cit> . similarly, we found that e. coli k- <dig> mg <dig> also showed high protein expression of σ <dig> during stationary phase in wt and Δrpos strain . in addition, we examined how many genes bound by σ <dig> in the wt strain were bound by σ <dig> when rpos was deleted. we found that about 89% of those genes was bound by σ <dig> when σ <dig> was missing, . this unexpectedly high rate of σ-factor substitution explains how the majority of genes directly bound by σ <dig> recovered their expression when rpos was knocked out . however, it is still unclear how some of those genes were up-regulated.

because approximately 89% of these genes were bound by σ <dig>  we measured the intensity of σ <dig> binding in Δrpos during stationary phase with chip-chip experiments, and compared the binding intensity between up-regulated and down-regulated genes . this measurement showed that up-regulated genes were bound more strongly by σ <dig> , suggesting that strong σ <dig> binding resulted in increased transcription. this finding indicates that the presence of σ <dig> actually contributed to repressing the transcriptional expression of some genes, presumably by competition for shared promoters between σ <dig> and σ <dig> 

comparative analysis of the sigma factor network in closely related species
with the detailed reconstruction of the σ-tug network in e. coli, we could now address the issue of the difference between such networks in closely related species. genome-wide identification of tsss of two gamma-proteobacteria, e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, revealed that promoter regions upstream of orthologous genes are differently organized in the two species, resulting in different usage of tsss  <cit> . as σ-factors recognize sequence elements of promoters, and they are directly upstream of tsss, it is important to determine any differences in σ-factor binding patterns. whereas the e. coli genome contains seven σ-factors, k. pneumoniae is known to have only five, missing flia and feci, which are found in e. coli. the five σ-factors that the two species have in common are highly conserved in terms of amino acid sequence similarity:  <dig> % for rpod,  <dig> % for rpos,  <dig> % for rpon,  <dig> % for rpoh, and  <dig> % for rpoe. promoter sequence motifs examined from the tsss were found to be identical between e. coli and k. pneumoniae, suggesting that the sequence motifs for each orthologous σ-factor are identical  <cit> . however, the different organization of upstream regulatory regions of the two species and the different pattern of transcription initiation indicates the possibility of significantly diverse σ-factor binding.

to investigate the binding patterns of two major σ-factors, rpod and rpos, we analyzed chip-chip datasets for σ <dig> under exponential phase and σ <dig> under stationary phase grown in glucose minimal media as described previously  <cit> . e. coli and k. pneumoniae have  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes, respectively, and  <dig>  coding genes were defined as orthologs by two-way reciprocal alignment. binding of σ <dig> and σ <dig> under specified conditions upstream of those orthologous genes was analyzed and clustered . of the  <dig>  orthologous genes, 60% showed the same binding patterns . these two closely related bacteria, e. coli and k. pneumoniae, share the majority of their gene contents, with most of the open reading frames having highly conserved sequences. however, conserved genes showed significantly different σ-factor binding patterns, indicating diverse gene regulation by different transcription initiation . interestingly, in some cases, altered binding of σ-factors was associated with changes in tu organization, suggesting even more diverse regulation between the two species. although two major σ-factors were found to bind differently upstream of orthologous genes, regulation between σ-factors remained unchanged, except for the two missing σ-factors, flia and feci, in k. pneumoniae . thus, regulation of gene expression by σ-factors may evolve faster than regulation among the σ-factors themselves.

CONCLUSIONS
genome-scale measurements enabled us to reconstruct the σ-tug network in e. coli k- <dig> mg <dig>  this network is at the core of transcriptional regulation in bacteria. its reconstruction has enabled the assessment of its topological characteristics, functional states, and limited comparison with related species. with the integration of a growing body of experimental data on transcription factor  binding and activity, the resource provided here opens up the possibility of developing a comprehensive reconstruction of the entire transcriptional regulatory network in e. coli, which would simultaneously describe the function of σ-factors and tfs that produce the entire expression state of the organism.
