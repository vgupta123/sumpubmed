BACKGROUND
association mapping   mapping) is a powerful and promising tool for gene detection in crop plants . am has been used in cultivated barley   and its wild progenitor - h. vulgare subsp. spontaneum  <cit> . a key consideration in am is population structure, which may cause spurious correlations and lead to an elevated false-positive rate  <cit> . in cultivated barley there is a high level of population structure and the major factors determining it are growth habit and inflorescence type  <cit> .

the major components of growth habit are sensitivity to vernalization and photoperiod, and these environmental signals are associated with tolerance to low temperature . in general, maximum cold tolerance is achieved in genotypes with winter growth habit during the vegetative growth stage. transition to a reproductive growth stage is triggered by vernalization and/or long photoperiod. in contrast, the flowering time of spring habit varieties is not accelerated by vernalization. spring growth habit types may vary in their response to photoperiod, but they all have a limited capacity to tolerate low temperature stresses. varieties with facultative growth habit can be either fall- or spring-planted since they are not vernalization sensitive. they can be as cold tolerant as winter types  <cit> . the photoperiod sensitivity of the facultative growth habit class varies, although sensitivity to short photoperiod is advantageous from the standpoint of delaying the vegetative to reproductive transition  <cit>  and thus ensuring the maximum capacity for low temperature tolerance  <cit> .

three loci  interact in an epistatic fashion to determine vernalization sensitivity. vernalization sensitivity occurs only in one of the possible allele combinations at these loci: vrn-h2_vrn-h1vrn-h1vrn-h3vrnh <dig>  <cit> . deletion of part or all of the genomic region encoding three zinc finger-cct domain  transcription factors accounts for the vernalization-insensitive  alleles at the vrn-h <dig> locus  <cit> . deletions spanning putative cis-elements in the intron i are the functional polymorphisms at vrn-h <dig> accounting for the vernalization-insensitive  alleles  <cit> . hvft <dig> corresponds to the vrn-h <dig> locus and associations between intron i haplotypes and dominant/recessive alleles have been described  <cit> .

genes determining photoperiod response  and low temperature tolerance  were first reported as qtl. ppd-h <dig> affects flowering time under long-day conditions whereas ppd-h <dig> affects flowering under short photoperiods  <cit> . hvprr <dig> encodes a pseudo-response regulator and corresponds to ppd-h <dig>  <cit> . the basis of the recessive late-flowering  phenotype is a snp mutation affecting a conserved residue in the cct domain  <cit> . hvft <dig> is the determinant of ppd-h <dig>  <cit> . delayed flowering under short-day conditions  is due to gene deletion  <cit> . fr-h <dig> is coincident with vrn-h <dig>  but it is not yet resolved if cold temperature tolerance is a pleiotropic effect of the vrn-h <dig>  <cit> . one or more members of a cluster of hvcbf genes is  the candidate for the fr-h <dig> locus  <cit> .

the two-rowed and six-rowed inflorescence types refer to the number of fertile florets per rachis node in the barley spike. the presence of a recessive allele at the vrs <dig> locus is sufficient to cause the wild type two-rowed barley to become six-rowed barley . multiple loss-of-function mutations in the hvhox <dig> gene  cause a cessation of suppression of lateral-spikelet development and thus lead to the  six-rowed phenotype  <cit> .

previous attempts to use genome-wide am to identify loci determining growth habit  <cit>  have identified significant associations with snp markers in the vicinity of some of the determinant genes but not the genes themselves. cockram et al.  <cit> , using a limited marker data set and passport data on growth habit found significant associations only when they used specific insertion/deletion  and snp markers in the vrn-h <dig> and vrn-h <dig> genes. most of the associated markers were designed based on the functional polymorphisms of vrn-h <dig> and vrn-h <dig> 

in this report we describe, in essentially chronological order, the results of genotyping, phenotyping, and analyzing the resulting data from barley germplasm sets varying in size and composition. this research was conducted under the auspices of the barley coordinated agricultural project   <cit> . the starting point for this project was the formation a small core collection  of reference accessions contributed by each of the ten participating breeding programs, the cap core. the cap core was genotyped with snp markers  implemented in three  <dig> -plex oligonucleotide polymorphism arrays   <cit> . at the same time - in order to fully characterize genes involved in morphology, growth and development - a subset of  <dig> genes were re-sequenced or genotyped in the cap core. functional polymorphism assays were based on re-sequencing of target genes in the germplasm array and based on these results, genotyping for specific snps and indels. the cap core was phenotyped for inflorescence type and vernalization sensitivity under long-day greenhouse conditions. the snp, functional polymorphism, and phenotype data were used for am and analysis of interactions. larger arrays of breeding germplasm were subsequently genotyped and phenotyped under the auspices of the cap project. this provided  <dig>  accessions phenotyped for inflorescence type and  <dig> accessions phenotyped for vernalization sensitivity. the snp and phenotype data from the larger populations were then used for am and analysis of interactions. our objective was to empirically assess the effects of population size, population type, and analysis of interactions on detection of genes determining the principal germplasm groups of barley.

RESULTS
vernalization sensitivity and inflorescence type
in the greenhouse, under unvernalized and long-day photoperiod conditions,  <dig> of the  <dig> accessions flowered between 32- <dig> days after planting . these genotypes are vernalization-insensitive and are therefore of spring or facultative growth habit. eleven accessions did not flower within  <dig> days, at which point the experiment was terminated. these  <dig> genotypes are vernalization-sensitive and have winter growth habit. the  <dig> cap core accessions are comprised of  <dig> two-rowed and  <dig> six-rowed genotypes . all of the two-rowed accessions but one  are vernalization-insensitive. in the six-rowed group, there are  <dig> vernalization-insensitive and  <dig> vernalization-sensitive genotypes.

 gel-based characterization of snp, indels

 cloning and sequencing of a gene or putative functional domain within a gene

â€  zcct-h gene family members are present or absent

with specific reference to vernalization sensitivity and row-type, re-sequencing the promoter region, exon  <dig> and intron  <dig> of vrn-h <dig> from the  <dig> accessions revealed the five previously characterized intron  <dig> deletion types   <cit> . comparison of the intron 1-deletion types and the haplotypes showed that some haplotypes have more than one deletion type. sixty-seven accessions had complete deletions of the three tightly linked zcct-h genes at vrn-h <dig>  seventeen accessions - six with spring and  <dig> with winter growth habit - contained all three of the zcct-h genes. eighteen vernalization-insensitive genotypes contained just the c form of the zcct-h gene family but had complete deletions of the a and b forms. sequence alignment of the proposed functional polymorphism in hvft <dig> intron  <dig> from accessions varying in growth habit revealed that the proposed functional polymorphism  <cit>  does not account for phenotypic variation in growth habit in the cap core germplasm. the vernalization-sensitive cultivar strider , with a recessive vrn-h <dig> allele, showed the intron  <dig> haplotype hypothesized to lead to a dominant vrn-h <dig> allele. the alignment revealed a c/t promoter snp , which better differentiated the dominant  and recessive  alleles at this locus. alignment of the full length  hvhox <dig> gene from the  <dig> genotypes revealed nine snps and seven haplotypes. six of these haplotypes correspond to previously described alleles  <cit> . four six-rowed accessions have a novel vrs <dig> haplotype. because this novel recessive allele cannot be explained by simple mutation of any previously-described dominant alleles, we designate this allele vrs <dig> a <dig> . the deduced polypeptide sequence of vrs <dig> a <dig> does not correspond to any of the reported recessive vrs <dig> alleles and sequencing additional promoter regions  did not reveal causal polymorphisms that could explain the recessive  phenotype conferred by vrs.a <dig>  the  <dig> deficiens accessions in the germplasm array all have the vrs <dig> b <dig> allele.

linkage disequilibrium and population structure
the average extent of ld is aproximately  <dig>  cm when considering the entire germplasm array . within the spring two-rowed group  it is approximatetly  <dig> cm. within the spring six-rowed  it is ~  <dig>  cm. in the case of the winter six-rowed , only pairwise comparisons whose r <dig> value equals  <dig> have a p-value below than  <dig> . therefore, for this group the ld threshold was set at an r <dig> value of  <dig> and no estimation of the extension of ld was possible.

using structure  <dig>   <cit>  we identified four subpopulations, the sub-population to which each accession belongs, and the percentage of admixture of each line. the four sub-populations roughly correspond to winter six-rowed, spring six-rowed, and two groups of spring two-rowed genotypes. one group of spring two-rowed genotypes is comprised of baronesse, eight baronesse-derived genetic stocks , and four other varieties with baronesse in their parentage. the first two components in the principal components analysis  confirmed this division by row type and growth habit, but no subgroups within the spring two-rowed genotypes were detected . these results are similar to those reported by  <cit> , who performed a pca analysis with a subset of  <dig> accessions of the cap core. there is a degree of admixture, with some accessions appearing in sub-populations that do not correspond to their growth habit or row type. for example, charles  is clustered with the spring two-rowed; owb-dominant  is clustered with winter six-rowed; 88ab <dig> and 88ab536-b  are clustered with spring six-rowed; and washford, belford, steptoe and owb-recessive  are clustered with winter six-rowed.

comparison of the first two axes of the pca of the  <dig> cap core accessions and the pca of the  <dig>  cap i, ii and iii sets shows a similar distribution of the lines . pca of the latter three cap sets shows the same pattern of division between row type and growth habit as the cap core. in both cases, the degree of admixture is higher among lines with the same growth habit than it is among lines with the same row type.

association analysis
growth habit and inflorescence traits are the main determinants of population structure in the cap core and including population structure in the model used for am will diminish the ability to detect the genetic determinants of these traits. we therefore tested four models for am: simple marker/trait regression , accounting only for the kinship of the individuals , correction by population structure , and correction for population structure and also for the relatedness of the individuals .

with each of the four analyses, we found bopa snps associated with growth habit  located in, or closely linked to, the principal genes determining growth habit  and inflorescence type  . the number of these significant associations - initially considered as false positives - was lower for the m+q+k analysis compared to m+q or m+k analyses and much lower compared with only m. even with the m+q+k analysis  without a priori knowledge of the roles of the genes in determining the two phenotypes, significant snps would not always have been the first choices for more detailed analyses: a large number of significant associations were found throughout the genome and many of these were as significant, or more significant, than those associated with the vrn-h and vrs <dig> loci.

the bopa markers included  <dig> snps in the vrn genes that we designed based on re-sequencing: five for vrn-h <dig>  two for vrn-h <dig> and three for vrn-h <dig>  however, bopa markers for vrn-h <dig> and vrn-h <dig> were not included in the association analysis because the contrasting phenotypes encoded by these genes are the consequence of gene presence vs. deletion  or insertion/deletion . due to the coding of the deletion alleles as missing data, these loci fell below the quality threshold for selecting suitable markers for am.

in order to have markers in high ld with the described functional polymorphism in the vrn-h and vrs <dig> loci, we developed genotype assays based on our re-sequencing data and conducted a second round of am. in this second round, we also included "synthetic markers" that summarize the dominant/recessive nature of the allele type based on the re-sequencing information and on a priori knowledge of gene function . the results from am with these additional markers  revealed highly significant associations for the synthetic markers in vrn-h <dig>  vrn-h <dig>  and vrs <dig>  in the case of vrs1_at for row type and vrn2_at for flowering time, the allele type markers were the most significant . in the case of vrn1_at, two other markers,  <dig> and  <dig> cm from vrn-h <dig>  gave similar significance.

analysis of interactions
since vernalization response is controlled by the epistatic interaction between vrn genes  <cit>  and at least one other gene  interacts with vrs <dig> to determine row type  <cit> , we tested for interactions between significant markers detected in the m+q+k genome-wide association analysis. for each trait we selected all markers with p-values below a threshold of  <dig>  . based on this criterion,  <dig> markers were selected for inflorescence type and  <dig> for vernalization sensitivity. these significant markers included the synthetic markers for allele type vrn1_at, vrn2_at for vernalization sensitivity and vrs1_at for row type. for all possible two-way combinations of markers for each of the two traits, we performed likelihood ratio tests .

for vernalization sensitivity, the interactions between five markers, out of the  <dig>  possible two-way combinations, showed a remarkable increase in the -log p score compared with the others . two of the significant interacting markers were vrn1_at and vrn2_at. we also found similar values of -log p for interactions between vrn2_at and hvzctt_hc_p <dig> with two markers on chromosome 2h: 1_ <dig> and 1_ <dig> at consensus map positions  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm respectively. both have identical distributions of alleles within the cap core.

ten two-way interactions, out of the  <dig>  possible, predicted perfectly the row type in the cap core. of these, four interactions involved the allele type vrs1_at. the markers involved in these interactions are on chromosomes 1h , 2h , 4h , and 5h  . to determine if these loci  are determinants of the two-rowed vs. six-rowed phenotype, we examined the snp allele type in the oregon wolfe barley mapping population  <cit> . the parents of this population are two-rowed  and six-rowed  and the allele types at the four markers in these two accessions fits the same pattern as observed for the cap core and a larger population of cap lines . however, in the owb doubled haploid mapping population, the only locus with a perfect association with inflorescence type is vrs <dig>  six additional interactions also predicted perfectly the row type . all of these interactions involved a marker located on 1h  with the same markers that interacted with vrs1_at  or located close to them . detailed information about the snp markers detected in the interaction analysis can be found in additional file  <dig> 

genome-wide association analysis using larger populations
in order to assess the effects of population size on detection of genes known to determine vernalization sensitivity and inflorescence type, we conducted genome-wide association analyses for row type in the  <dig>  accessions represented in the cap core, cap i, cap ii, and cap iii germplasm sets  phenotyped for this trait  and the  <dig> winter and facultative lines from the oregon state university barley breeding program  phenotyped for vernalization sensitivity . all these lines and accessions had been genotyped with bopa  <dig> and  <dig> 

for inflorescence type, there were significant associations on chromosomes 2h and 1h , and these associations correspond to the same regions identified in the cap core using the allele type marker of vrs <dig> and interaction analysis. the significant markers on 2h are in the vicinity of vrs1; the most significant marker was 1_ <dig>  the most significant marker on 1h was 3_ <dig>  the allele type at each of these four loci is fixed in 99% of the two-rowed accessions  . there was no pattern for allele type in the six-rowed germplasm. for example, the alleles fixed for the two-rowed accessions are present in the following frequencies in the six-rowed accessions: 17% , 45% , 22%  and 80% .

for vernalization sensitivity, there were significant associations on chromosomes 2h, 3h, 4h and 5h . these associations were found in the same genome regions as in the cap core, except for those found in 2h. regarding the two loci on 2h detected in the interaction analysis in the cap core  we found that in  <dig> of the  <dig> accessions from this winter/facultative breeding germplasm have the same haplotype.

discussion
snp and haplotype diversity in target genes
molecular analyses of  <dig> genes from seven loci known to be involved in the genetic determination of growth habit and inflorescence type - the two major traits causing strong population structuring - from a unique set of  <dig> barley accessions revealed high sequence diversity and complex haplotypes. for vrn-h <dig>  vrn-h <dig>  and vrs <dig> - the three genes where we had sequence information from the full set of  <dig> genotypes - we found  <dig>   <dig>  and nine snp sites, which resulted in eight, seven, and seven haplotypes, respectively. using a subset of the core set -  <dig> spring, two facultative, and two winter growth habit accessions - also revealed high nucleotide diversity at six loci: vrn-h <dig> , ppd-h <dig> , ppd-h <dig> , and fr-h <dig> . identification of these haplotypes in marker-assisted breeding programs will require the use of multiple snps per gene, or alternative assays.

multi-locus haplotypes define growth habit classes
even more genetic diversity was found when we considered multi-locus haplotypes of loci involved in the regulation of growth habit. functional polymorphisms in, and epistatic interactions between, the three vrn-h and two ppd-h loci have been reported  <cit> . based on the proposed functional polymorphisms, we determined multi-locus haplotypes of the three vrn-h and two ppd-h loci and found  <dig> of the possible 32-allele combinations . thirty-two out of the  <dig> spring growth habit cultivars had "spring" alleles at all five loci, while  <dig> spring growth habit genotypes had recessive  vrn-h <dig>  and "spring" alleles at the other four loci. the abundance of the winter vrn-h <dig> allele in cultivated spring growth habit germplasm was unexpected since allelic variants at the vrn-h <dig> locus were previously reported only in exotic barley genotypes  <cit> . seven out of  <dig> winter growth habit genotypes had "winter" alleles at the five loci. in total, vernalization-insensitive  genotypes had  <dig> multi-locus haplotypes and vernalization-sensitive  genotypes had three. our results show that a large number of single-locus and multi-locus haplotypes are involved in determining flowering time and thus growth habit.

effect of population structure and linkage disequilibrium on association analysis
the cap core is a limited sample of heterogeneous germplasm. the array is comprised of accessions representing a range of growth habit, row type, usage and origin. however, this set is representative of the array of lines usually used in barley breeding programs of north america. the distribution and the number of lines in each group defined by the pca analysis follows the same pattern in the cap i, ii and iii sets and in the cap core . we used row type and growth habit  as models for genome-wide association analysis for several reasons. these phenotypes exemplify two different genetic scenarios. in the case of row type, there are multiple snps in the vrs <dig> gene that lead to the loss of function phenotype. the genes determining vernalization sensitivity interact epistatically and the functional basis is known. the two phenotypes can be scored unequivocally. finally, growth habit and row type are the two traits considered world-wide to define germplasm structure in barley. even after accounting for structure in the cap core, we were able to identify markers associated with the two traits because there was some degree of admixture.

the limited admixture between the three subgroups representing combinations of growth habit and row type  is likely due to the tendency of geographically dispersed breeding programs to limit germplasm exchange. accessions from the same structure group will have a more similar history of selection for genomic regions that control row type and growth habit than accessions from other groups. within each structure group, accessions from any given breeding program will also tend to be more similar. as a consequence, the extent of ld is longest in germplasm of the same growth habit/row type group. however, the extent of ld within each group was reduced by the fact that accessions within each group came from different programs. the reduced estimated extension of ld in the winter six-rowed group may also be due to the small sample size . barley, a self-pollinated species, is reported to have a sufficiently high level of ld that, with sufficient marker coverage, association mapping should be effective  <cit> . in the case of the cap core, we found an average extension of ld of  <dig>  cm. since the average marker density is  <dig>  cm and we have markers  in the candidate genes responsible of the target traits, we would expect genome-wide association mapping to be effective.

however, the estimated extension of ld in any germplasm array must be taken cautiously, since the estimated values are averaged within each chromosome. there are individual cases of high r <dig> values between distant loci  and also other cases where ld decreases abruptly within a few hundreds of bp .

genome-wide single marker association analysis
in the cap core we found significant associations for snps located in the regions of the genome where the target genes are located . however, we also found other significant associations at alpha =  <dig> , after multi-test adjustment, for  <dig> row type and seven vernalization sensitivity markers in other regions. therefore it would be difficult to identify vrs <dig> and the vrn-h genes based on these results. without a priori information regarding the locations of the target genes, it would be very difficult to differentiate the true associations from the spurious ones in the cap core.

including "synthetic" allele type markers for vrs <dig> and vrn-h <dig> we obtained more highly significant associations than with any snp marker. this is especially relevant in the case of vrs <dig>  where some snps were located within the candidate genes . in the case of vrn-h <dig>  although some snp markers from the determinant genes were also included, two other bopa markers showed p-values comparable to the allele type marker . however, these marker loci mapped  <dig> and  <dig> cm from vrn-h <dig>  even though these bopa makers are in ld with the functional polymorphism they would not identify vrn-h <dig> without prior knowledge of this gene's location and function.

analysis of interactions
in addition to the significant interaction between the two markers for the functional polymorphisms in vrn-h <dig> and vrn-h <dig>  we found a highly significant interaction for vrn-h <dig> with two markers located on the short arm of chromosome 2h . no genes or qtls for winter vs. spring growth habit are reported in this region, but one allele is predominant at both loci in the vernalization-sensitive accessions in the cap core , and osu cap i, ii and iii . the fact that the same allele was also present in a considerable number of vernalization insensitive  lines of the osu cap i, ii and iii  suggests that this region could play a role in any of the multiple aspects of winter growth habit  since these are target traits in the osu breeding program. a member of the cbf gene family  cosegregates with this locus in the consensus map. other members of the cbf gene family are implicated in low temperature tolerance  <cit> , but no direct effect of hvcbf <dig> on cold tolerance has been reported.

regarding row type, we found a perfect association for the interaction between allele type marker vrs1_at with four other markers  . all four markers are located in regions where other loci related to row type have been described  <cit> . these include vrs <dig>  <cit>  on the long arm of chromosome 1h, vrs <dig>  <cit>  and int-b  <cit>  on the short arm of 5h. the marker in 2h co-locates with vrs <dig> in the consensus map  <cit> . the marker in 4h maps to the reported position of int-c  <cit> . alleles at these four marker loci follow a consistent pattern in the parents of the owb population  and owb-recessive ). however, there is no correlation between alleles at these four regions and the row type in the dh progeny after one cycle of recombination . therefore, genes in these regions are not causal for row type, but have reached a high degree of fixation in two-rowed vs. six-rowed germplasm. int-c is an excellent example, where a specific dominant allele is necessary for the commercial six-rowed phenotype, but dominant or recessive alleles are found in cultivated two-rowed germplasm.

results of am from larger populations
using  <dig>  lines we found significant associations in the same regions on chromosomes 2h and 1h that we detected using the cap core. regarding 2h, these results confirm that the extension of ld in barley, even in highly structured germplasm, is sufficient to detect associations with markers in ld with a gene, such as vrs <dig>  where different loss-of-function mutations lead to the same phenotype. the most significant markers are located in a  <dig> cm interval around vrs <dig> and one of them  is located within the coding region of the gene, although it is not the marker with the highest significance . on chromosome 1h we found significant markers in the same region we identified using interaction analysis and the cap core data. these associations may correspond to vrs <dig>  <cit>  or to a gene, or genes, that interact with the transcription factor encoded by vrs <dig>  vrs <dig> has not been characterized phenotypically or genetically in the cap germplasm and none of the annotations for significant est-based snps correspond to obvious candidate genes . the cap core interaction analysis, and the analysis of the full set identified associations on chromosome 5h in the vicinity of int-b. on chromosomes 3h, 6h and 7h significant associations were found in both analysis. there are no obvious candidate genes for these associations. therefore, with the exception of int-c , the two approaches identified the same regions.

in the case of vernalization sensitivity, using  <dig> accessions we found significant associations on chromosomes 4h and 5h at the same regions identified using interaction analysis based on the  <dig> accessions in the cap core . these associations correspond to the locations of vrn-h <dig> and vrn-h <dig>  respectively. as described by  <cit> , the most significant associations may not always correspond to candidate genes. there is no obvious candidate for the 2h associations, which differed in position between the two analyses.

CONCLUSIONS
small, highly structured collections, such as the cap core, are generally not considered ideal for association mapping. the failure to find meaningful associations between the target traits and single snps could be due to a number of factors including:  small sample size,  phenotypes resulting from epistatic interactions,  abrupt decay of ld around, or within, genes,  multiple snps leading to the same phenotype,  the functional basis of allelic diversity is not due to snps,  multiple haplotypes for candidate genes whose definition requires the use of multiple snps within each gene  snp ascertainment bias. we found that am in the cap core was effective for locating genes involved in the two phenotypes - growth habit and row type - that determine the principal germplasm groups of barley only when synthetic markers based on allele re-sequencing were included and an analysis of interactions was employed. these analyses identified potential candidate interacting genes for both phenotypes. when we extended the analyses to larger populations, we identified the same genome regions. the cost of genotyping, together with the intensive computing requirements for am, would make it difficult for most breeding programs to use this approach for detecting associations for phenotypes showing more complex inheritance. our results suggest that breeding programs may be able to make effective use of smaller germplasm arrays for am, provided they have a functional polymorphism data for anchor loci and use interaction analysis. the results can be useful guides for deeper exploration of significant associations in larger germplasm arrays.
