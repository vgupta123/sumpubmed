BACKGROUND
proteins are responsible for many different and important biochemical functions, such as ligand binding, signaling or catalysis  <cit> . many of these events occur on the μs-ms timescale making the detection and interpretation of these motions critical for understanding their biological significance. advances in solution nuclear magnetic resonance  of biomolecules have enabled the measurement of protein dynamics on different timescales. relaxation experiments measuring the two relaxation rates r <dig>  and r <dig>  as well as the steady state heteronuclear noe are used to detect motion within ps-ns  <cit> . however, detection of these motions is limited by the molecular tumbling of the molecule, which is on the order of ns. recent developments in 15n/13c relaxation-compensated carr-purcell-meiboom-gill  and r1ρ rotating-frame relaxation dispersion experiments  <cit>  have enabled measurement of protein dynamics on the μs-ms timescale. from these experiments the exchange contribution to transverse relaxation , exchange constant , chemical shift differences between exchanging states  and the population of individual states can be extracted. consequently, relaxation dispersion experiments are commonly used to investigate changes in dynamics caused by ligand binding  <cit> , to discover limiting events during enzyme catalysis  <cit> , to follow protein folding and intermediate states as well as to detect functionally important hidden states  <cit> . furthermore, it has been proposed that a detailed understanding of the dynamical behavior of a protein at atomic resolution may help identify novel drug target sites  <cit> .

here, we present a novel software  that is designed for simple and automated analysis of relaxation dispersion data. data can be fitted to two states and at one or more field strengths. model selection protocols are included for the selection of the best models and monte carlo simulations are used to estimate errors of extracted parameters. furthermore, publication quality 2d and 3d plots and color coded structures are easily created.

implementation
programming
the software nessy is written in python http://www.python.org for multi platform compatibility and uses wx.python http://www.wxpython.org to build the graphical user interface . the program was tested on windows  and linux  and can be downloaded for free from http://nessy.biochem.unimelb.edu.au either as compiled binaries  or as source code. the software is open source and general public licensed .

theory
nessy performs automatic relaxation dispersion data analysis using nmr peak lists as inputs. in a first step, the effective transverse relaxation rate r2eff is extracted from a series of cpmg relaxation dispersion experiments according to:

  r2eff=1/tcpmg lni/i 

where tcpmg is the constant cpmg time, i is the intensity of the peak in the reference spectrum and i is the intensity of the peak at the cpmg frequency, vcpmg. then, data are fitted to different models, which can be selected individually. these models are divided on the basis of no exchange , two-site fast  and two-site slow  exchange.

no exchange: model 1
model  <dig> describes residues, which are not involved in exchange processes:

  r2eff=r <dig> 

where r <dig> is the effective transverse relaxation rate at infinite vcpmg.

two-state exchange: model  <dig> and 3
equation  describes exchange between two states a and b

  a⇌kb-aka-bb 

where ka-b and kb-a are the forward and backward exchange rates, respectively, between the states a and b.

model  <dig> describes fast-limit exchange  and is fitted to  <cit> :

  r2eff=r20+Φkex1-4vcpmgkextanhkex4vcpmg 

where

 Φ=pa*pb*δω <dig> 

and pa and pb are the populations of the two state models , kex is the chemical/conformational exchange  constant and δω is the chemical shift difference between states. in eq.  only r <dig>  kex and Φ can be extracted, as pb and, δω cannot be uniquely determined.

model  <dig> describes slow-limit exchange  according to the richard-carver equation  <cit> :

  r2eff=r20+kex2-vcpmgcosh- <dig> 

where

 d±=12±1+Ψ+2δω21/2η±=±Ψ+1/21∕222vcpmgΨ=kex2-δω2ξ=-2δω 

nessy also automatically calculates the exchange contribution to transverse relaxation, rex, where for fast exchange, rex = Φ/kex, and slow exchange, rex = papbkex/2).

optimization and model selection
exchange parameters are optimized by using the levenberg-marquardt algorithm to minimize the target function

  χ2=∑n <dig> 

where r2n,eff is the value at each vcpmg at data point n, r2n,eff,calc is the calculated rate constant. error σr2eff of r2eff was assumed to be constant within each residue and calculated according to the definition of pooled variance   <cit> . σr2eff is calculated using ndup replicated experiments for vcpmg values, such that nj replicates were obtained at j. the effective transverse relaxation rate of a given peak r2eff in these nj replicates has the standard deviation sj:

  σr2eff2=∑j=1ndupsj2∑j=1ndup 

model selection is performed using aicc  by default, but other tests, such as aic or f-test are included as well  <cit> . uncertainties are estimated using  <dig>  monte carlo simulations.

synthetic data
to demonstrate validity of fit and model selection performed by nessy, synthetic data was produced using the in-built synthetic data creator. data were created for models  <dig> and  <dig> by introducing an error of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 10%  as experimental nmr relaxation dispersion data usually have smaller errors than 5%. data was analyzed using nessy and fitted to the models described above.

nmr spectroscopy
carr-purcell-meiboom-gill  relaxation dispersion experiments of a  <dig>  mm pctx <dig> sample  were recorded on a bruker  <dig> mhz avance iii spectrometer. experiments were acquired at  <dig> k using  <dig>  s constant cpmg period  as a single scanned interleaved pseudo 3d experiment. relaxation dispersion profiles were obtained by recording spectra with varying cpmg pulse frequencies  . spectra were processed in nmrpipe  <cit>  and intensities extracted using ccpnmr  <cit> .

RESULTS
synthetic data
to demonstrate the validity of the coding and model selection, synthetic data containing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 10% errors for models  <dig> and  <dig> were created using the in-built tool in nessy. this synthetic data was fitted to models  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> by minimizing the χ <dig> function  and the model selection was performed by comparing aicc values. errors for the extracted dynamics parameters were estimated by  <dig> monte carlo simulations. in all cases, irrespective of the noise, the correct model was chosen by aicc for each data set . notably, for the synthetic-data model  <dig> the χ <dig> values calculated for model  <dig> were always at least as good as those for model  <dig>  indicating the need for model selection by statistical methods such as aicc. for the synthetic-data model  <dig>  both χ <dig> and aicc selected model  <dig>  during the calculation, nessy creates plots for each fit to a model. for example, a comparison of fits to models  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for the synthetic data is shown in figure  <dig> .

the parameters kex, pb and δω that were extracted for model  <dig> matched the initial parameters used to generate the synthetic data within the order of the introduced error . as expected, introducing larger errors into the synthetic data sets produced larger errors for the extracted parameters .

fitting relaxation dispersion experiments of pctx <dig> at  <dig> mhz
nessy was tested using nmr data acquired at  <dig> mhz for pctx <dig>  a 40-residue spider toxin  <cit> . data for two resonances showing frequency dependent rex were fitted to models  <dig> to  <dig>  trp  <dig> best fitted to model  <dig>  and phe  <dig> to model  <dig> . an overview of fits to model  <dig> to  <dig> as well as the best fit is shown in figure  <dig>  fitting of the slow-limit exchanging signal of trp  <dig> extracts a kex of  <dig>  ±  <dig> 1/s. although the fit shows slow-limit exchange, only one resonance was present in the spectrum. this is in accordance to the extracted population of the minor conformation  of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and a chemical shift difference  for the two conformations of  <dig> ±  <dig> rad/s. as residue phe  <dig> is in fast exchange, only kex and Φ were extracted. the extracted conformation exchange rate  for this residue was  <dig>  ±  <dig> 1/s.

to best illustrate calculated motion, nessy creates pymol macros for color and width-coded structures. such structures are created for model selection, kex and rex. figure  <dig> shows color coding for both model selection and kex of pctx <dig>  models are visualized in different colors per residue, while extracted dynamics parameters  are colored from yellow to red and also represented by thicker lines for increasing values. note that in figure  <dig> only two residues were analyzed and therefore, only two residues are colored.

global fit to synthetic data
the dynamics parameters, kex, pb and δω, are highly interdependent and data from a single static field is typically insufficient for their accurate determination. consequently acquisition of relaxation dispersion data at two or more fields is necessary for the robust and accurate estimation of these parameters  <cit> . nessy is able to perform a global fit by sharing parameters kex, pb and δω, but taking the field dependency of δω into account. to demonstrate this function, synthetic data was created for data virtually recorded at  <dig> and  <dig> mhz. for  <dig> mhz data, synthetic data  previously described was used. additionally, synthetic data was generated at  <dig> mhz . both data sets were simultaneously fitted to models  <dig> to  <dig> . model selection was performed using aicc and errors of fit for the parameters were estimated by  <dig> monte carlo simulations per residue and individual experiments.

for the synthetic data for model  <dig> at two different spectrometer frequencies, fits  generally improved with increasing number of parameters. using aicc model selection nessy clearly chooses the correct model . for the synthetic data for model  <dig>  the correctly chosen model according to aicc was model  <dig> . a summary of extracted parameters is given in table  <dig> and fits to models  <dig> and  <dig> for both synthetic data sets  are shown in figure  <dig> 

cluster analysis
under certain circumstances, motion in different parts of a macromolecule may be concerted. therefore, multiple residues/nuclei may experience the same exchange. in such cases, it is useful to cluster these residues and fit them simultaneously. cluster analysis of data recorded at one or more static fields is included in nessy, where single values of kex and populations are determined for all residues. individual parameters, δω and ϕ  are obtained for each residue. to demonstrate this function, synthetic data for  <dig> residues experiencing kex of  <dig>  1/s and a minor population  of  <dig>  were created using model  <dig>  consisting of 5% noise. the transverse relaxation rate, r <dig>  as well as δω were different for each residue. the data was clustered and simultaneously fitted to models  <dig> or  <dig> . the selected model by aicc was model  <dig> and the extracted exchange constant kex was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  1/s and population pb was  <dig>  ±  <dig> . furthermore, the extracted values for δω and r <dig> correlated to their initial values .

discussion
the software presented in this article permits the automated data analysis of relaxation dispersion experiments. the user has the opportunity to choose to fit to the entire data set or individually selected residues. in addition, data from two or more magnetic fields can be globally fitted. during global fits, field dependency of δω is taken into account. multiple residues can be grouped and analyzed simultaneously using built-in cluster analysis .

maximum flexibility of data entry has been included. for example, peak lists containing peak intensities that are created by any other software can be imported; protein sequences are read either from pdb files, retrieved from the internet using uniprot identifier http://www.expasy.ch or can be added manually; cpmg frequencies are read directly from bruker vd  lists. furthermore, nessy is linked to the bruker protein dynamic center  so that projects can be exported in pdc and directly read into nessy for extended data analysis. in addition, nmrview  <cit>  tables can be imported directly.

during the calculation, nessy produces plots and csv files  of the r2eff profiles and the individual fits for each calculated residue as well as the extracted values  and statistics  for each model. in addition, color coded structures for selected models, kex and rex are created . furthermore, nessy offers tools to create custom made 2d and 3d plots in different formats and styles suitable for publication .

synthetic data as well as experimental nmr cpmg relaxation dispersion data were analyzed using nessy. the quality of fits of the synthetic data was assessed by comparing original values to those extracted from data analysis . for choosing the best fitting model nessy evaluates the need and benefit for describing the experimental data with more parameters by using aicc, aic or f-test. by default, model selection is performed using aicc to avoid over fitting, as more parameters  may give better fits. the advantage of using aicc  compared to f-test is that data do not have to be normally distributed. as relaxation dispersion experiments usually consist of  <dig> to  <dig> data sets, normal distribution of data cannot be assumed. for the synthetic data the correct model was consistently chosen and the extracted values were statistically similar to the initial values. to demonstrate usability of nessy for nmr data, two signals of pctx <dig> were analyzed . one signal experienced slow-limit and the other fast-limit chemical exchange. in the case of slow exchange, the minor populated conformation was present at  <dig> %, which is in accordance with the nmr spectra, where only one peak is visible.

to be able to unambiguously distinguish between fast and slow exchange and to extract populations and shift differences, experiments should be collected at two or more different magnetic fields  <cit> . nessy supports global fitting at multiple field strengths, while taking the field dependency of δω into account. synthetic data for models  <dig> and  <dig> at two different static frequencies  were created and analyzed. data were fitted to models  <dig> to  <dig> and in each case the correct model was chosen for both global fits .

CONCLUSIONS
in this article, the main features of nessy have been presented, such as curve fitting, model selection and data presentation of relaxation dispersion experiments. nevertheless, nessy is not limited to these functions. as relaxation dispersion experiments enable the extraction of populations of individual states, nessy offers tools to calculate the free energy  between states. for data that fit best to fast exchange models, the populations of each state cannot be extracted, as kex and δω cannot be uniquely determined. an integrated function in nessy is to calculate the populations for residues with known chemical shift differences, such as observed in ligand binding experiments. if a series of experiments are recorded over a temperature range, the temperature dependence of Δg can be used to extract entropy  and enthalpy  changes using van't hoff analysis. nessy supports automatic van't hoff analysis of both linear and non-linear models  <cit> . furthermore, nessy can calculate activation energy barriers using transition state theory and the eyring equation and generate energy landscape plots.

taken together, we present user-friendly software for nmr relaxation dispersion  data analysis that requires minimal user intervention. in addition, nessy can be used to analyze biophysical experiments, such as van't hoff and transition state theory analysis and to create publication quality 2d and 3d plots. due to its flexibility, users can choose between different relaxation dispersion models and statistical tests for model selection. results generated by nessy are aimed to be usable for publication. tables can be produced directly using csv files; 2d and 3d plots are created during or after analysis and color coded structures can be directly used in publications. note that each figure display in this article was created in nessy. this software is open source and freely available from http://nessy.biochem.unimelb.edu.au. nessy comes with a detailed manual and tutorial. for additional help, questions can be addressed at the nessy mailing list .
