BACKGROUND
integrative conjugative elements  are a class of bacterial mobile genetic elements that encode features necessary for their site-specific integration and excision from host genomes, self-circularisation and transfer by conjugation  <cit> . ices are divided into families based on similarity between core genes  and the site of integration they utilise within host chromosomes. the sxt/r <dig> family share a highly similar integrase gene and integrate into the prfc gene of enterobacterial hosts  <cit> . in addition to encoding host beneficial traits such as antibiotic resistance determinants  <cit> , many sxt/r <dig> family ices express an unusual cell-sensitising function  <cit> . preliminary characterisation of the uv-inducible, cell-sensitising function of the prototype, ice r <dig>  determined the effect to be reca-dependent  <cit> , while further analysis based on construction of a deletion library of ice r <dig> found that three core ice genes, namely orfs90/ <dig> and orf <dig> were involved  <cit> . deletion analysis also revealed that orf <dig>  which encodes a putative λ ci-like repressor protein  <cit> , could only be deleted in strains where orfs90/ <dig> had previously been removed suggesting that the repressor protein may prevent lethal expression of orfs90/ <dig>  additionally, cloning and controlled expression of both orfs90/ <dig> and orf <dig> revealed that expression of orf <dig> alone was cytotoxic to wild type e. coli while expression of orfs90/ <dig> was only cytotoxic to wild type e. coli cells harbouring the ice r <dig>  this indicated that orf <dig> was responsible for the observed uv-inducible cytotoxicity  <cit> .

reca is a well-documented regulatory protein involved in uv-induced proteolysis of repressor proteins associated with the sos response  <cit> . induction of reca  following uv irradiation, results in cleavage of phage λ and phage λ -like ci repressors resulting in phage induction and indeed cleavage of other sos repressors  <cit> . bioinformatic analysis of the ice r <dig> encoded orf <dig> has shown it encodes a ci-like repressor protein with homology to phage λ <dig> ci  <cit> , while analysis of the ice r391-encoded orfs90/ <dig> has indicated that these genes may act as a putative transcriptional enhancer complex. it has been demonstrated that orfs90/ <dig> stimulate the expression of ice specific genes such as orf <dig>   <cit> , which is an element-encoded excisionase, resulting in formation of increased levels of a circular form of the ice, presumably as a transfer intermediate. the ice r391-encoded orf <dig>  has previously been found to be essential for ice r <dig> transfer  <cit> . indeed, based on bioinformatic homology, orf <dig> is predicted to encode a putative trav homolog, an outer membrane protein involved in the ice type iv secretion system and thought to function in the construction and stabilisation of the outer-membrane portion of the mating pore required for ice transfer by conjugation  <cit> . deletion of the ice r391-encoded orf <dig> was recently shown to abolish the uv-inducible sensitising effect of this ice while clones expressing orf <dig> under arabinose control were shown to compliment for the transfer deficiency but additionally mimic the cell toxicity associated with uv induction  <cit> .

here, a model is proposed  for the control of this unusual ice r <dig> uv-inducible sensitising effect based on expression data examining the key genes involved and supported by a number of directed ice r <dig> deletions.

RESULTS
orfs90/ <dig> stimulate orf <dig> transcription after exposure to uv irradiation
we previously demonstrated that over-expression of orf <dig> when cloned into the arabinose inducible pbad33-orf <dig> construct was responsible for the uv-inducible sensitisation observed in ice r <dig> and other ices of the sxt/r <dig> family  <cit> . mutagenesis data also suggested that the putative transcriptional controller encoded by orfs90/ <dig> was also involved, although not directly. to investigate the relationship between orfs90/ <dig> and orf <dig>  we utilised both qualitative and quantitative rt-pcr targeting these genes in different mutant backgrounds and with and without uv irradiation.

qrt-pcr analysis of expression levels pre and post exposure to 40 j.m- <dig> uv-irradiation indicated that orfs90/ <dig>  orf <dig> and the previously documented uv-inducible orf <dig>   <cit>  were up-regulated after exposure to uv irradiation. analysis indicated that orf <dig>  specific mrna levels were up-regulated  <dig>  fold, orf <dig>   <dig>  fold and orfs <dig>   <dig>  fold. in contrast other ice r <dig> genes not involved in cell sensitisation  <cit>  were not up-regulated post exposure: aph  was down-regulated  <dig>  fold post-exposure while orf <dig>  was also down-regulated  <dig>  fold post-exposure. analysis of the up-regulated genes in mutant backgrounds indicated that in a Δorfs90/ <dig>  background, orf <dig> up-regulation was abolished  while analysis of orfs90/ <dig> transcription in a Δorf <dig>  background did not prevent orfs90/ <dig> specific mrna up-regulation following uv irradiation . this indicated a dependency on orfs90/ <dig> for orf <dig> up-regulation but not vice versa. further analysis of orf <dig> transcription in a Δorfs40/ <dig> mutant   <cit>  demonstrated that deletion of these genes, upstream of orf <dig>  did not prevent the uv-induced up-regulation of orf <dig> mrna, suggesting that inducible orf <dig> transcription was stimulated through a region directly in front of the orf <dig> gene  and that this region should be investigated further. this observation is supported by previous deletion analysis where orfs40/ <dig>  and ∆orf <dig>  were deleted but retained the uv-inducible sensitising phenotype  <cit> . analysis of the up-regulated orfs90/ <dig> and orf <dig> mrna decay rate post-exposure  revealed that orfs90/ <dig> mrna levels were maximally up-regulated directly after exposure and decayed rapidly with a return to basal levels within 5 minutes post-exposure. however orf <dig> mrna levels were maximally up-regulated 7 minutes post-exposure and up-regulated levels were sustained for a longer period of time, minimally over 30 minutes . the observation of the rapid increase and decay of orfs90/ <dig> specific mrna levels followed by a slower and longer sustained increase in orf <dig> specific mrna levels supports the hypothesis that uv irradiation acts as an inducing agent for orfs90/ <dig>  which subsequently up-regulates the transcription of orf <dig> possibly from a site preceding the gene.

cytotoxic orf <dig> transcription is regulated through a region directly upstream of orf43
based on previous observations with the Δ <dig> and ∆ <dig> ice r <dig> deletions, which deleted orfs <dig> to most of orf <dig> inclusive  <cit> , the most likely location for an orf <dig> control site would be the last 36 bp specific to orf <dig> directly in front of orf <dig>  comparative bioinformatic analysis of this region and the previously documented orfs90/ <dig> regulated orf <dig>   <cit>  uncovered a short 7 bp homologous dna sequence  present in front of both genes. this conserved sequence was located 77 bp upstream of orf <dig>  but directly in front of orf <dig> where the last  <dig> base pairs of the sequence overlapped the first two base pairs of the predicted start codon of orf <dig>  as no other recognisable promoter or operator region was predicted upstream of orf <dig>  this 7 bp sequence may possibly represent a binding motif for the putative transcriptional enhancer . however it is well known that transcriptional enhancer control sites can be difficult to predict  <cit>  as they tend to be short dna sequences lacking high sequence conservation even between enhancer types. to examine if the last 36 bp specific to orf <dig> and preceding orf <dig> did in fact contain a control site for orf <dig> transcription, orf <dig> specific mrna expression was analysed in a number of specific deletion backgrounds spanning this putative control region . three directed ice r <dig> deletion mutants were generated  in an e. coli  background; the koa deletion removed the genes orf <dig> to orf <dig> and placed the inserted ampicillin cassette on the reverse complement to ensure removal of all possible promoters of orf <dig> transcription except for the 36 bp directly in front of orf <dig>  the kob deletion removed the genes orf <dig> to orf <dig> similar to koa but additionally removed the 36 bp directly in front of orf <dig> while the koc deletion was identical to the koa mutation, preserving the putative 36 bp control site but also contained an additional secondary zeocin resistant deletion which removed orfs90/ <dig>  these three deletion mutations were screened by both qualitative and quantitative uv survival assays to determine their effect on the cell-sensitising function  and additionally were examined by rt-pcr to determine if orf <dig> specific mrna transcription still occurred . the koa mutant retained the uv-inducible sensitising function  and orf <dig> mrna transcription , while the kob and koc mutations abolished the sensitising function as well as orf <dig> mrna transcription. as the kob and koc mutations deleted either the proposed orfs90/ <dig> control site or orfs90/ <dig> genes respectively and both of these deletions prevented cytotoxic orf <dig> transcription, this analysis supported the hypothesis that orfs90/ <dig> encode a transcriptional enhancer complex that activates cytotoxic orf <dig> transcription through the 36 bp sequence directly in front of orf <dig>  in addition, cloning of orf <dig> with the predicted control site in front of the gene showed that the cytotoxic function could be repressed only in cells not containing orfs90/ <dig> , again supporting the hypothesis.

strr is streptomycin resistant; cmr is chloramphenicol resistant; kmr is kanamycin resistant; hgr is mercury resistant; zer is zeocin resistant; ts is temperature sensitive; nalr is nalidixic acid resistant and amr is ampicillin resistant. uv- is uv-inducible cell-sensitising function abolished; tra- is conjugative transfer deficient mutant.

site-directed mutagenesis of orf43
bioinformatic analysis of orf <dig> indicated that it belongs to a highly conserved trav-like family of transfer proteins involved in type iv secretion systems required for conjugation  <cit> . site-directed mutagenesis of pbad33-orf <dig> was carried out to convert two leucines at a.a. positions  <dig> and  <dig> to prolines in the predicted orf <dig> protein . insertion of two prolines was expected to disrupt the α-helical transmembrane spanning region of orf <dig> by creating a 30° bend  <cit> . this mutation was found to cause loss of the cytotoxic function of pbad33-orf <dig> <cit>  as there was no observable decline in host cell growth rates after induction of the mutant clone compared to the wild type clone . since introduction of membrane disruptive mutations abolish the effect, this is suggestive that membrane association is required in addition to over-expression of the orf <dig> protein for sensitisation and cytotoxicity associated with this ice product. other directed mutations such as conversion of glutamine at position  <dig>  to asparagine  was shown to have no effect on uv sensitisation or orf <dig> transcription .

CONCLUSIONS
hierarchical control of the ice r <dig> uv-inducible sensitising effect
many sxt/r391-like ices reduce post uv survival rates of e. coli host cells through the action of a reca-dependent process  <cit> . mutational analysis of the ice r <dig> determined that the core genes orfs90/ <dig> and orf <dig> were required for expression of the cell-sensitising function  <cit>  while bioinformatic analysis indicated that orf <dig> likely encodes a λ ci-like repressor similar to reca substrates in other phage systems that are cleaved following sos induction  <cit> . initial attempts to delete orf <dig> proved fruitless and no deletion could be isolated. however a Δorf <dig>  deletion  <cit>  could be isolated in an ∆orfs90/ <dig> mutant background suggesting that orf <dig> may control expression of orfs90/ <dig> which we have shown here directly control expression of orf <dig>  the ultimate instigator of the cytotoxicity associated with ice r <dig>  the data presented here and in armshaw and pembroke   <cit>  have led to the development of a model to explain the control of uv-inducible sensitisation . we hypothesise that uv irradiation of e. coli induces the host reca protein which results in cleavage of the ice r <dig> encoded product of orf <dig>  the phage λ <dig> ci-like ice repressor. we propose that cleavage of orf <dig> in turn leads to expression of orfs90/ <dig> which in turn leads to up-regulation of orf <dig> and other ice r <dig> genes such as orf <dig>   <cit> . we have previously demonstrated that up-regulation of orf <dig>  leads to increased ice r <dig> transfer  <cit> . in the related ice sxt, beaber et al.,   <cit>  demonstrated that setr, the sxt homolog of orf <dig>  acted as a repressor of ice sxt transfer and that it is bound to ice operators that controlled setc/d, sxt homologs of orfs90/ <dig>  in a similar way to our proposal for ice r <dig>  they also proposed that repression was lifted by induced reca protein cleaving the setr repressor in a similar manner to our proposal for orfs90/ <dig>  the reca dependence for the ice r <dig> uv-sensitising effect  <cit> , the similarity to the sxt system  <cit> , the deletion data and qrt-pcr data presented here support the model presented.

it would thus appear that uv irradiation is the instigator of the control loop leading to over expression of orf <dig> which leads to cytotoxicity. since normal levels of orf <dig> are required for ice transfer and play a key part in formation of the conjugative transfer system of ice r <dig>  it appears that the associated cytotoxicity is related to the induced overexpression. evidence in support of this comes from data showing that overexpression of orf <dig> from the arabinose inducible clone pbad33-orf <dig> leads directly to cytotoxicity  <cit> . the uv-inducible sensitising effect is conserved amongst many sxt/r <dig> ice family members  <cit> . a sophisticated control system is in place to control this effect yet the exact nature and reason for conservation of such an unusual apparently ‘evolutionary negative’ effect remains to be elucidated. we are currently examining the nature of the cytotoxicity and developing theories for its function and retention.
