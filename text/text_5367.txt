BACKGROUND
spi <dig> is a hematopoietic lineage-specific tf belonging to the ets family  <cit> . it plays an important role in the development of myeloid and lymphoid cells and is highly expressed in monocytes  <cit> . the expression of spi <dig> is regulated by the combined activity of a proximal promoter and an upstream regulatory element  located −17-kb upstream of the transcription start site  in human  <cit> . deletion of the ure region contributes to the exacerbation of acute myeloid leukemia  or erythroleukemia  <cit> . the spi <dig> regulatory regions are differentially methylated in spi1-expressing and nonexpressing cell lines  <cit> . this differential pattern is also maintained during hematopoietic differentiation, in which es cells are hypermethylated while hematopoietic stem cells become hypomethylated . meanwhile, abnormal hypermethylation of the spi <dig> regulatory regions is frequently observed in myeloma cell lines with downregulated spi <dig>  <cit> . thus, this methylation change seems to be important for spi <dig> expression. however, no molecular mechanism behind the change in dna methylation status at spi <dig> regulatory regions has been reported yet.

runx <dig> is another tf that is essential for the regulation and maintenance of mammalian hematopoiesis  <cit> . a previous study reported that runx <dig> regulates spi <dig> at both transcriptional and epigenetic levels  <cit> . runx <dig> binding at the conserved sites in the ure of spi <dig> is critical for the onset of spi <dig> expression during hematopoietic stem cell formation, making spi <dig> the direct downstream target of runx <dig>  <cit> . at the pre-hematopoietic or hemangioblast stage, the inception of runx <dig> expression induces chromatin remodeling at the regulatory regions of spi <dig>  in which the binding of runx <dig> to the spi <dig> regulatory region is essential  <cit> . moreover, several studies have revealed that chromatin remodeling is coupled with dna demethylation during embryonic development  <cit> . therefore, we hypothesize that runx <dig> may also be involved in recruiting the dna methylation status change at the spi <dig> regulatory regions.

here, we describe that the ectopic expression of runx <dig> in hek-293t cells induces dna demethylation at the two functionally active regulatory regions of spi <dig> in a replication-independent manner.

RESULTS
runx <dig> overexpression induced dna demethylation at spi <dig> −17-kb ure

spi <dig> contains two regulatory regions; one is the −17-kb ure that lies upstream of the transcription start site  and the other is the proximal promoter region . while the −17-kb ure contains three runx <dig> binding sites , the proximal promoter region does not contain any such sites  <cit> . to analyze how runx <dig> expression affects the dna methylation status of spi <dig> regulatory regions, we first focused on the −17-kb ure. we transduced runx1-overexpressing lentivirus into hek-293t cells, a cell line that does not express runx <dig>  followed by dna methylation analysis by bisulfite sequencing. we observed drastic dna demethylation in runx1-overexpressing hek-293t cells . this dna demethylation appeared to be runx1-specific because we did not see any of these changes in either mcs-transduced  or wild-type hek-293t cells. the region as a whole was significantly demethylated  . the dna demethylation of all individual cpg sites investigated at the −17-kb ure was also found to be significant  .fig.  <dig> schematic representation of spi <dig> gene structure: simplified scheme of the human spi <dig> locus, indicating the two regulatory regions of spi1: distal promoter  and proximal promoter. binding sites for runx <dig> and spi <dig> are shown by red and orange boxes, respectively. the red horizontal arrows in the ure and the proximal promoter indicate primers designed for methylation study

runx <dig> overexpression induced partial dna demethylation at spi <dig> proximal promoter
the proximal promoter region of spi <dig> does not contain any binding site for runx <dig>  <cit>  ; therefore, we wondered whether runx <dig> can still induce any change in dna methylation in this region. our results showed that runx <dig> can induce partial demethylation in the proximal promoter region, with about 30% of cpgs being demethylated . although the demethylation was incomplete, the region as a whole was significantly demethylated  and the change at most of the cpg sites was also found to be significant , in comparison to that of mcs-transduced cells.fig.  <dig> dna methylation status analysis of spi <dig> proximal promoter in runx1-overexpressing hek-293t cells: a target sequence of the human spi <dig> proximal promoter region. the number represents the cpg sites and the spi <dig> binding site is also shown. b methylation pattern diagrams of wild-type, mcs, and runx1-overexpressing hek-293t cells at the spi <dig> proximal promoter region. each row of circles represents the result of a single amplicon and each column represents a single cpg site. black circles denote methylated cpgs and open circles represent unmethylated ones. the cpg numbers shown correspond to the target nucleotide sequence, shown in a. c quantification of percent cpg methylation at the proximal promoter region in wild-type, mcs, and runx1-overexpressing hek-293t cells. the p value calculated from the comparison between mcs and runx1-overexpressing hek-293t cells was significant . d comparison of methylation status graph at each individual cpg site between mcs and runx1-overexpressing hek-293t cells. the significantly demethylated cpg sites are marked with asterisks, ***p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , *p <  <dig> 




molecular mechanism of runx1-induced dna demethylation at spi <dig> regulatory regions
dna demethylation can be active or passive in nature, where active demethylation occurs by the enzymatic activity of tet enzymes in the absence of replication, while passive demethylation occurs slowly during several rounds of replication  <cit> . to identify the type of runx1-induced demethylation at both spi <dig> regulatory regions, we used mitomycin-c to arrest cell growth at the g <dig> phase. different concentrations of mitomycin-c were individually tested to identify the concentration when the ratio of edu positive cells was zero  . we observed drastic dna demethylation in runx1-transduced cells at the spi <dig> −17-kb ure region, even upon mitomycin-c treatment, which would prevent passive dna demethylation . the statistical analysis revealed that the region as a whole was significantly demethylated  . significant dna demethylation was found at each cpg site investigated , the same as in the runx1-overexpressing cells not treated with mitomycin-c, as shown in fig. 2d. interestingly, we also observed runx1-induced active dna demethylation at the proximal promoter region in mitomycin-c-treated cells . these results demonstrate the ability of runx <dig> to induce active dna demethylation at both spi <dig> regulatory regions. recent studies in zebrafish have highlighted that runx <dig> induces the expression of dnmt3bb. <dig>  a dnmt <dig> paralog in this animal model  <cit> . therefore, we next examined whether runx <dig> overexpression enhanced the expression of genes encoding enzymes that are known to be involved in both dna methylation and demethylation. specifically, we compared the expression levels of dnmt <dig>  dnmt3a and 3b, tet1- <dig>  and idh <dig> and idh <dig> between mcs and runx1-transduced cells. however, no difference in the expression of these genes was observed .fig.  <dig> active dna demethylation at spi <dig> regulatory regions. a quantification of the concentration of mitomycin-c for cell growth arrest at the g <dig> phase. b–d quantification of dna methylation at the −17-kb ure with 50 µg/ml mitomycin-c treatment. b the dna methylation pattern was measured at the −17-kb ure of mcs- and runx1-overexpressing hek-293t cells. c the percentage of methylation in mcs- and runx1-overexpressing hek-293t cells. d the methylation difference at each individual cpg site between mcs- and runx1-overexpressing hek-293t cells. all of the sites were significantly demethylated . e–g quantification of dna methylation at the proximal promoter upon 50 µg/ml mitomycin-c treatment. e the dna methylation pattern was measured at the proximal promoter region of mcs- and runx1-overexpressing hek-293t cells. f percentage of methylation in mcs- and runx1-overexpressing hek-293t cells. g the methylation difference at each individual cpg site in mcs- and runx1-overexpressing hek-293t cells. all of the sites were significantly demethylated . h mrna expression level of genes involved in dna methylation and demethylation in mcs- and runx1-overexpressing hek-293t cells 




runx <dig> induces significant spi <dig> expression, but much less than in monocytes
dna methylation at gene regulatory regions generally suppresses gene expression, possibly by blocking transcription factor binding at those regions. to examine whether runx1-induced dna demethylation at spi <dig> regulatory regions can affect spi <dig> endogenous expression, we measured spi <dig> expression in runx1-overexpressing hek-293t cells by qrt-pcr. spi <dig> endogenous expression was significantly  induced by the runx <dig> ectopic expression, which was estimated to involve a 12-fold upregulation, from the differences in Δct values . however, the spi <dig> expression level for runx1-overexpressing hek-293t cells was still far less than that of monocytes; only 3% of spi <dig> mrna expression was estimated.fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr analysis of endogenous spi <dig> mrna expression. the endogenous spi <dig> mrna level was examined in the indicated cell types. results are presented after normalization to gapdh, and data are shown as the mean ± sem . a lower Δct value depicts higher expression. the significance represented by the p value was calculated by two-tailed and unpaired student’s t tests, with the significance levels shown by asterisks 




discussion
in this study, we found that the ectopic expression of runx <dig> in wild-type hek-293t cells converts the methylation status of both spi <dig> regulatory regions from hypermethylated to hypomethylated; the results also showed that the induced demethylation was replication-independent active dna demethylation. further, runx <dig> overexpression did not change gene expression of enzymes involved in both dna methylation and demethylation. it has been reported that chromatin remodeling of the spi <dig> ure region in hemangioblasts is induced by the binding of runx <dig>  which also accompanies the dna demethylation of this region  <cit> . this suggests that runx <dig> binding directly recruits the dna demethylating machinery. actually, several tfs have recently shown to be involved in dna demethylation by recruiting dna demethylation machinery  <cit> . on the other hand, the proximal promoter region revealed partial but significant dna demethylation, although it does not contain any binding sites for runx <dig> and neither any mechanism of its binding is known  <cit> . thus, it was interesting to ponder how this replication-independent active dna demethylation occurs at the proximal promoter region of spi <dig> by the overexpression of runx <dig>  previous chromatin immunoprecipitation  data have shed light on the binding of various transcription factors in the ure and proximal promoter regions  <cit> . therefore, we speculate that other runx1-regulated transcription factor may also be able to induce dna demethylation at both regulatory regions. thus, we can conclude that runx <dig> could be directly or indirectly responsible for inducing dna demethylation at the spi <dig> regulatory regions, although the actual process remains to be confirmed.

our study also showed that runx <dig> overexpression is not sufficient for inducing the higher level of endogenous spi <dig> expression in hek-293t cells. the partial demethylation at the proximal promoter region may be responsible for the low level of spi <dig> expression. in fact, the proximal promoter region of spi <dig> is completely hypomethylated in monocytes, in which spi <dig> is expressed at a higher level  <cit> . previous reports also suggest the positive correlation between dna demethylation at gene regulatory regions and gene expression, revealing that active genes are generally hypomethylated while inactive genes are generally hypermethylated at their promoter regions  <cit> . furthermore, the cells with high spi <dig> expression regulate this expression by forming an autoregulatory loop between its ure and the proximal promoter region  <cit> , which are in close proximity to each other  <cit> . thus, our data suggest that the autoregulatory loop may not form well due to incomplete demethylation at the proximal promoter. the presence of other transcription factors that are expressed in spi1-expressing hematopoietic cells could also be necessary to induce higher endogenous expression of spi <dig> 

we used hek-293t cells in this study because they are from a cell line that does not express runx <dig>  the propensity of these cells to undergo transfection, their availability, and the possibility of avoiding passage biasness during analysis also make them easy to use. since our results are derived from nonhematopoietic cells by using an artificial overexpression system, it would be preferable for our results to be evaluated further using hematopoietic cell lines in which runx <dig> and spi <dig> are endogenously expressed. however, dna demethylation at spi <dig> regulatory regions already occurs at the hematopoietic stem cell stage at which runx <dig> is expressed. as the next step, it may be necessary to perform such evaluation in hematopoietic cell lines under specific conditions or with gene manipulation.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the potential role of runx <dig> as a demethylating inducer. our results provide a hint about how demethylation occurs at spi <dig> regulatory regions.
