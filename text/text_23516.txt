BACKGROUND
human pathogens often evolve from animal reservoirs, and changes in virulence sometimes accompany acquisition of the ability to infect humans  <cit> . examples include smallpox virus, hiv, enterohemorrhagic e. coli, and bordetella pertussis. understanding how these events occur requires the ability to reconstruct evolutionary history, and this can be facilitated by the identification of evolutionary intermediates. an experimentally tractable opportunity to study human adaptation is provided by bordetella species. the bordetella genus currently includes nine closely related species, several of which colonize respiratory epithelial surfaces in mammals. b. pertussis, the etiological agent of pertussis  is exclusively adapted to humans; b. parapertussis refers to two groups, one infects only humans and the other infects sheep  <cit> ; and b. bronchiseptica establishes both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections in a broad range of mammalian hosts, which sometimes include humans  <cit> . numerous studies have implicated b. bronchiseptica as the closest common ancestor of human-adapted bordetellae, with b. pertussis and b. parapertussishu, evolving independently from different b. bronchiseptica lineages  <cit> . the genomes of these  <dig> species differ considerably in size and b. pertussis and b. parapertussis have undergone genome decay, presumably as a consequence of niche restriction  <cit> .

most mammalian bordetellae express a common set of virulence factors which include putative adhesins such as filamentous hemagglutinin , fimbriae, and pertactin, and toxins such as a bifunctional adenylate cyclase/hemolysin, dermonecrotic toxin, and tracheal cytotoxin. b. pertussis additionally produces pertussis toxin  <cit> . of particular significance here is the bsc type iii secretion system  locus which encodes components of the secretion machinery, associated chaperones, and regulatory factors. remarkably, only a single t3ss effector, btea, has been identified to date  <cit> . btea is an unusually potent cytotoxin capable of inducing rapid, nonapoptotic death in a diverse array of cell types  <cit> . t3ss and btealoci are highly conserved in b. pertussisb. parapertussis, and b. bronchiseptica <cit> .

a seminal phylogenetic analysis using multilocus sequence typing  of  <dig> bordetella stains with diverse host associations led to the description of a new b. bronchiseptica lineage, designated complex iv, which differs in several respects from the canonical complex i b. bronchiseptica cluster  <cit> . complex i strains are most commonly isolated from non-human mammalian hosts, whereas the majority of complex iv strains were from humans, many with pertussis-like symptoms. complex iv strains were found to exclusively share is <dig> with b. pertussis, suggesting a close evolutionary relationship among these lineages. complex iv strains and b. pertussis are proposed to share a common ancestor, although the genes encoding pertussis toxin  and the ptl transport locus were found to be missing in the majority of complex iv strains that were sampled  <cit> . additionally, several other b. pertussis virulence genes were also found to be absent or highly divergent, including those encoding dermonecrotic toxin, tracheal colonization factor, pertactin, and the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis locus. differences between virulence determinants expressed by b. pertussis and complex iv strains have been suggested to be driven by immune competition in human hosts  <cit> , a model also proposed for differences observed between b. pertussis and b. parapertussishu <cit> .

given their apparent predilection of complex iv b. bronchiseptica isolates for human infectivity, we have initiated a systematic analysis of their virulence properties and mechanisms. we found that complex iv strains, on average, display significantly elevated levels of cytotoxicity in comparison to complex i isolates. several complex iv strains are also hyperlethal in mice, and hyperlethality in vivo as well as cytotoxicity in vitro is dependent on the btea t3ss effector protein  <cit> . comparative whole-genome sequence analysis of four complex iv isolates was used to identify similarities and differences between b. bronchiseptica lineages. results from genome comparisons did not identify significant genomic regions that are unique to complex iv strains but missing from complex i isolates. this implies that complex iv-specific phenotypes are determined by polymorphisms in conserved genes, differential regulation  <cit> , or other epigenetic mechanisms rather than acquisition or retention of unique genomic determinants.

cytotoxicity assays
bacteria were cultured in ss media overnight and were then sub-cultured in ss media to an optical density of ~ <dig>  at  <dig> nm. for cytotoxicity assays, bacteria were added to previously seeded cell monolayers in 12- or 24-well tissue culture plates at the indicated mois. the plates were centrifuged for 5 min at  <dig> x g and incubated for up to 4 h at 37°c with 5% co <dig>  to measure cell cytotoxicity, lactate dehydrogenase  release was used as a surrogate marker for cell death. ldh release in the supernatant media was assayed using a cytotox 96® non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay kit , according to the manufacturer's instructions. the maximal ldh release was defined as 100% and was determined by adding lysis solution to uninfected monolayers, determining the absorbance at 490 nm, and then subtracting the background value. each sample was measured in triplicate in at least three independent experiments.

animal infection experiments
wild-type female c57bl/6ncr  mice, 4–6 weeks of age, were purchased from charles river breeding laboratories . the animals were lightly sedated with isoflurane  prior to intranasal infection with the indicated number of cfu of bacteria in a total volume of 40 μl of phosphate-buffered saline . bacteria were cultured in ss media overnight and were then sub-cultured in ss media to an optical density of ~ <dig>  at 600 nm. inocula were confirmed by plating serial dilutions. for survival curves, groups of four mice were inoculated with the indicated dose, and the percent survival was monitored over a 30-day period. mice with lethal bordetellosis, indicated by ruffled fur, labored breathing, and diminished responsiveness, were euthanized to alleviate unnecessary suffering  <cit> . to enumerate the number of bacteria in respiratory organs, groups of three to four mice were sacrificed at the indicated time points and bacterial numbers in the lungs and tracheas were quantified by plating dilutions of tissue homogenates on bg plates with appropriate antibiotics, following incubation at 37°c for 2 days. the mean ± the standard error was determined for each group. the statistical significance between different groups was calculated by student's two-tailed t-test. a significance level was set at p values of ≤ <dig> . all animal experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. murine survival percentage was analyzed with the log-rank  test. all mice were maintained in ucla animal research facilities according to national institutes of health and university of california institutional animal care committee guidelines. animals were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions with free access to food and water. all experiments were approved by the ucla chancellor's animal research committee.

histopathological analysis
lungs were inflated with 10% neutral buffered formalin at the time of necropsy. following fixation, tissue samples were embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 μm, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin, giemsa, and warthin-starry for light microscopic examination at the translational pathology core laboratory of ucla. sections were scored for pathology by a veterinarian with training and experience in rodent pathology who was blinded to experimental treatment. the degree of inflammation was assigned an arbitrary score of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> .

in vitro adherence assays
human lung epithelial  cells and human cervical epithelial  cells were grown in f-12 k and dmem medium, containing 10% fetal calf serum on cover slips in standard 12-well tissue culture plates, respectively. bacteria in their mid-log phase were added to cell monolayers at a moi of  <dig> as previously described  <cit> . the plates were spun at 200 × g for 5 min and then incubated for 15 min at 37°c. the cells were then washed six times with hanks' balanced salts solution, fixed with methanol, stained with giemsa stain  and visualized by light microscopy. adherence was quantified by counting the total number of bacteria per eukaryotic cell in at least three microscopic fields from two separate experiments.

trypsin digestion of polypeptides for mass spectrometry
for secretome analysis by mass spectrometry, bacteria were cultured in ss media overnight and were then sub-cultured in ss media to an optical density at  <dig> nm of ~ <dig> . a 5 ml aliquot was removed and centrifuged at  <dig>  x g at 4°c for 10 min to remove bacterial cells. the resulting supernatant, containing proteins secreted into the culture medium, was filtered through a  <dig>  μm membrane to remove contaminating bacterial cells. the filtered supernatants were then desalted and concentrated using a centrifugal filter device  into ~300 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer. the samples were reduced by incubation in 10 mm dithiotreitol  in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate at 37°c for 1 h. they were then alkylated by adding 55 mm iodoacetamide in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and incubated at 37°c in dark for 1 h. finally, the samples were digested at 37°c overnight with addition of 75 ng trypsin  in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. for in-gel trypsin digestion of polypeptides, a previously described method was used  <cit> .

nano-liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry 
nlc-ms/ms with collision induced dissociation  was performed on a linear trap quadrupole fourier transform  integrated with an eksigent nano-lc. a prepacked reverse-phase column  containing resin  was used for peptide chromatography and subsequent cid analyses. esi conditions using the nano-spray source  for the ltq-ft were set as follows: capillary temperature of 220°c, tube lens 110 v, and a spray voltage of  <dig>  kv. the flow rate for reverse-phase chromatography was 5 μl/min for loading and 300 nl/min for the analytical separation . peptides were resolved by the following gradient: 2–60% buffer b over 40 min, then increased to 80% buffer b over 10 min and then returned to 0% buffer b for equilibration of 10 min. the ltq ft was operated in data-dependent mode with a full precursor scan at high-resolution  and six msms experiments at low resolution on the linear trap while the full scan was completed. for cid the intensity threshold was set to  <dig>  where mass range was 350– <dig>  spectra were searched using mascot software  in which results with p <  <dig>   were considered significant and indicating identity. the data was also analyzed through sequest database search algorithm implemented in discoverer software .

identification of the core, non-core, and pan-genome of bordetella
"core" regions were defined as genome sequences that were present in all  <dig> bordetella genomes, while "non-core" regions were defined as genome sequences that are not present in all genomes. rb <dig> was used as the reference genome. for each of the other  <dig> sequences, genomes were mapped to the reference genome using nucmer  <cit> . all  <dig> “.coords” output files from the nucmer program were analyzed to identify overlap regions based on rb <dig> coordinates using a perl script. finally, “core” sequences were extracted based on the genome sequence of rb <dig> with the coordinates calculated above. unshared regions were then added to the reference genome to make a “revised” reference genome, which contained the original sequence plus unshared sequences. this process was repeated until all of the genomes were compared to include all unshared sequences included in the pan-genome. the core region was subtracted from the pan-genome of all the  <dig> genomes, and the remaining regions were identified as non-core regions.

hierarchical clustering using cluster and java tree view
 <dig> non-core fragments with more than 1000 bp were identified. an  <dig> row x  <dig> column matrix, in which  <dig> means "present" while  <dig> means "absent" for each non-core region, was entered to the cluster program   <cit> . average linkage was used for clustering. the java tree view program  <cit>  was used to show the clustering result.

RESULTS
hypercytotoxicity of complex iv isolates in vitro
cytotoxicity against a broad range of cell types is a hallmark of b. bronchiseptica infection in vitro <cit> . to measure relative levels of cytotoxicity, human epithelial cells , murine monocyte-macrophage derived cells , or human pneumocyte-derived cells  were infected with an array of complex i or complex iv b. bronchiseptica isolates . these strains represent different multilocus sequence types , and they were isolated from both human and non-human hosts . lactate dehydrogenase  release was used as a surrogate marker for cell death, and rb <dig>  an extensively characterized complex i rabbit isolate classified as st <dig>  was used as a positive control for cytotoxicity  <cit> . an isogenic rb <dig> derivative with a deletion in bscn, which encodes the atpase required for t3ss activity  <cit> , served as a negative control.

for hela  and j774a. <dig> cells , single time point assays showed a distinct trend, in which complex iv strains displayed higher levels of cytotoxicity than complex i isolates. for a <dig> cells the results were more dramatic . unlike other cell types previously examined  <cit> , a <dig> cells are nearly resistant to cell death mediated by the rb <dig> t3ss . similarly, other complex i strains displayed little or no cytotoxicity against these cells. in striking contrast, incubation with complex iv isolates resulted in significant levels of cell death . for a <dig> cells, strains d <dig> , d <dig> , d <dig>  and bbr <dig>  were 10- to 15-fold more cytotoxic than rb <dig>  parallel assays measuring bacterial attachment to a <dig> cells did not detect significant differences between complex i and complex iv isolates, indicating that relative levels of adherence are not responsible for the observed differences in cytotoxicity .

kinetic studies were performed next to increase the resolution of the analysis. we examined relative levels of cytotoxicity conferred by five complex iv strains towards hela, j774a. <dig> or a <dig> cells as a function of time, using rb <dig> as a complex i representative strain and rb50Δbscn as a negative control. following infection at an moi of  <dig>  cultures were sampled over a 4 h time period for measurements of ldh release. using hela cells, which are exceptionally sensitive to t3ss-mediated killing, only minor differences were detected between strains . although two of the complex iv strains, bbr <dig> and d <dig>  displayed slightly elevated cytotoxicity at intermediate time points, all strains reached maximum lysis by the end of the 4 h time course. for j <dig> cells, differences between complex iv strains and rb <dig> were apparent throughout the experiment, with bbr <dig> and d <dig> showing the highest levels of activity . as expected, the most dramatic differences were seen with a <dig> cells . most complex iv strains displayed a marked hypercytotoxicity phenotype compared to rb <dig>  with the exception of bbr <dig> which had an intermediate phenotype. interestingly, bbr <dig> is a dog isolate whereas all of the other complex iv strains tested were cultured from human infections.

roles of the bsc t3ss and the btea effector in hypercytotoxicity by complex iv b. bronchiseptica isolates
to examine the hypercytotoxicity phenotype in detail, two representative highly toxic complex iv strains of human origin, d <dig>  and bbr <dig> , were chosen for further analysis. to measure the contribution of the bsc t3ss, nonpolar in-frame deletions were introduced into the bscn loci of d <dig> and bbr <dig>  as shown in figure 3abscn mutations eliminated in vitro cytotoxicity against all three cell types, demonstrating an essential role for type iii secretion. we next examined the involvement of the btea effector in hypercytotoxicity. previous studies have shown that btea is essential for t3ss-mediated cell death induced by rb <dig>  and it is sufficient for cytotoxicity when expressed in mammalian cells  <cit> . for both complex iv strains, btea deletion mutations had a similar effect as Δbscn mutations and abrogated cytotoxicity .

the btea proteins expressed by bbr <dig> and d <dig> are identical except for the absence of two amino acids at the extreme carboxyl end of d <dig> btea . in contrast, when compared to rb <dig> btea, the complex iv effectors from bbr <dig> and d <dig> differ at  <dig> or  <dig> positions, respectively . interestingly, btea sequences from complex iv strains were more closely related to btea in b. parapertussishubpp <dig> than to homologs in b. bronchiseptica rb <dig> or b. pertussis tohama i. to determine whether btea polymorphisms are responsible for differences in cytotoxicity phenotypes, btea deletion derivatives of all three strains were complemented with the rb <dig> btea allele on a medium copy vector   <cit> . in each case, complemented levels of cytotoxicity were similar to those of the wild type isolate. most importantly, complemented Δbtea derivatives of strains d <dig> and bbr <dig> regained cytotoxicity against a <dig> cells, whereas rb <dig> Δbtea/pbtea remained non-cytotoxic against this cell line. taken together, these results demonstrate that the bsc t3ss and the btea effector are essential for cytotoxicity by d <dig> and bbr <dig>  the hypercytotoxicity phenotypes of the complex iv isolates, however, are not due to polymorphisms in btea. this is consistent with the conserved nature of this effector, both within and between bordetella species  <cit> . differential regulation of t3ss activity, the presence of novel secretion substrates, or alterations in accessory factors could account for phenotypic differences between strains .

t3ss secretome analysis
we next compared polypeptide profiles of proteins secreted into culture supernatants by the isolates examined in figure  <dig>  strains d <dig>  bbr <dig>  and rb <dig> were grown to early mid-log phase in liquid medium under conditions permissive for type iii secretion   <cit> . to specifically identify t3ss substrates, Δbscn derivatives were examined in parallel. culture supernatants were tca-precipitated, digested with trypsin, and separated by reverse-phase nano-liquid chromatography on a c <dig> column followed by tandem mass spectrometry . peptide profiles were queried against the rb <dig> protein database. nearly identical sets of peptides were detected in supernatants from strains d <dig>  bbr <dig> and rb <dig>  and these included peptides corresponding to t3ss substrates previously identified using rb <dig> . bsp <dig>  which polymerizes to form an elongated needle tip complex  <cit> , bopb and bopd, which form the plasma membrane translocation apparatus  <cit> , bopn, a homolog of yersinia yscn which functions as a secreted regulator  <cit> , and the btea effector were present in supernatants from wild type strains, but absent in supernatants of Δbscn derivatives. in the course of this analysis we discovered a novel t3ss substrate encoded from a conserved hypothetical orf , herein named btra, in supernatant fractions from rb <dig>  d <dig> and bbr <dig> but not from their Δbscn derivatives. importantly, examination of complex iv secretion substrates failed to identify unique polypeptides that were not expressed by rb <dig> or did not match the rb <dig> protein database. the relative amounts of t3ss substrates released into culture supernatants, as assessed by sds-page and western blot analysis, also failed to correlate with relative levels of cytotoxicity . although these observations did not reveal obvious differences in the t3ss secretome that could account for the hypercytotoxic phenotypes of d <dig> and bbr <dig>  it is important to consider that the activity of the bsc t3ss and its substrate specificity are regulated at multiple levels, and results obtained using broth-grown cells provide only a crude approximation of t3ss activity during infection .

summary of nlc-msms data indicated as peptide coverage for indicted t3ss substrate proteins in supernatant fractions from b. bronchiseptica strains grown to mid-log phase in stainer-scholte medium.

virulence of complex iv strains during respiratory infections
to determine if relative levels of cytotoxicity measured in vitro correlate with virulence in vivo, we used a murine respiratory intranasal challenge model  <cit> . groups of 4–6 week old female specific-pathogen-free c57bl/6ncr mice were intranasally infected with  <dig> x 105 cfu. at this dose, rb <dig> establishes nonlethal respiratory infections that generally peak around day  <dig> post-inoculation and are gradually cleared from the lower respiratory tract, while persisting in the nasal cavity  <cit> .as shown in figure 4a, complex iv strains segregated into two groups. the first caused lethal infections in some  or all  of the infected animals. the second group  caused nonlethal infections similar to rb <dig> 

in the experiment shown in figure 4b, animals were intranasally inoculated with  <dig> x 105 cfu of rb <dig> or the two most virulent complex iv isolates, d <dig> and bbr <dig>  and sacrificed three days later. both complex iv isolates were present in lungs at levels that were  <dig> to 30-fold higher than rb <dig> . histopathological examination of lung tissue from mice infected with d <dig> or bbr <dig> showed severe and widespread inflammation, affecting nearly the entire volume of the lung for d <dig> and up to 40% of the tissue for bbr <dig> . extensive migration of lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils resulted in severe consolidation of large areas of lung parenchyma. alveolar and interstitial edema as well as extensive perivascular and peribronchiolar inflammation were also observed. in contrast, lungs from animals infected with rb <dig> displayed only mild inflammation that covered less than 25% of the total lung volume.

we also examined the relative roles of the bsc t3ss and the btea effector in the in vivo virulence phenotypes of d <dig> and bbr <dig>  as shown in figure 4a, deletions in bscn or btea abrogated lethality following infection by either strain. consistent with these observations, Δbscn and Δbtea mutants also showed significantly decreased numbers of bacteria in the lungs at day  <dig> post infection  and a corresponding decrease in histopathology . these results demonstrate that in comparison to the prototype complex i strain rb <dig>  d <dig> and bbr <dig> are more virulent in mice following respiratory infection, and hypervirulence is dependent on type iii secretion and btea.

comparative whole-genome analysis of complex i and complex iv b. bronchiseptica strains
to determine if hypervirulent complex iv b. bronchiseptica strains share common genomic regions that might be responsible for the phenotypes reported here, we obtained whole genomic sequences of d <dig> , bbr <dig>  and d <dig> using next-generation high throughput sequencing. we included in our analysis the genomic sequences of b. bronchiseptica strains bbe <dig> and  <dig>   <cit> , bbf <dig>   <cit> , and rb <dig>  <cit> ; b. pertussis strains tohama i and  <dig>  <cit> ; and b. parapertussis strains  <dig> and bpp <dig>   <cit> . the b. bronchiseptica sequences were in various stages of assembly at the time of analysis . hierarchical clustering of virtual comparative genomic hybridization data supports previous mlst assignments of phylogenic relationships between bordetella strains  <cit> , as isolates from each complex are clustered together . genome alignments reveal that these strains share approximately  <dig>  mb of "core" genome sequence.

we next carried out a comparative analysis of the non-core genome to identify potential loci shared only by complex iv strains. despite sequences that are shared by more than one complex iv isolate, we did not identify complex iv genomic sequence that uniquely differentiate complex iv from complex i strains. strains d <dig>  bbr <dig> and d <dig> do, however, contain clusters of shared genes that are not present in other bordetella genomes . although these loci are missing in bbf <dig>  the virulence properties of this isolate has not been reported, raising the possibility that one or more of these loci may contribute to hypervirulence by a subset of complex iv strains. blastn analysis of overlap regions revealed a diverse set of genes involved mainly in signal transduction, metabolism, adhesin/autotransporter expression and type iv secretion of unknown substrates .

one locus of potential interest, found in two out of four sequenced complex iv isolates  but none of the other bordetella genomes, is predicted to encode homologs of the qsebc two-component regulatory system found in numerous bacterial pathogens  <cit> . in enterohemorrhagic e. coli  and salmonella sp., qsebc has been shown to sense host stress hormones  and regulate virulence gene expression  <cit> . the qsebc open reading frames from bbr <dig> and d <dig> are identical, and their predicted products share 47% amino acid identity and 63% similarity with ehec qseb, and 34% identity and 51% similarity with ehec qsec, respectively. using a pcr-based assay, we screened for the presence of qsebc in a larger collection of b. bronchiseptica isolates. as shown in figure 5c, this locus is present in  <dig> out of  <dig> complex iv isolates, but only  <dig> out of  <dig> complex i isolates. sequence analysis of pcr amplicons revealed high levels of nucleotide identity  between b. bronchisepticaqsebc alleles. although highly enriched in complex iv strains, qsebc is unlikely to represent a single, conserved pathway for hypervirulence since it is absent from strain d <dig>  nonetheless, the potential role of qsebc in bordetella-host interactions warrants further study. in addition to examining gross genomic differences, we also analyzed polymorphisms in virulence loci. nearly all of the virulence genes shared a high degree of homology . the bsc t3ss locus, the btr genes involved in t3ss regulation, as well as their upstream promoter regions had greater than 97% sequence conservation between rb <dig> and complex-iv strains. additionally, our analysis confirms the absence of ptx/ptl loci and divergence in tcfa and prn genes in sequenced complex-iv isolates as previously described by diavatopoulos et al.  <cit> .

discussion
the existence of a distinct lineage of b. bronchiseptica strains associated with human infections was described several years ago  <cit> ; however, little is known regarding the virulence properties of complex iv isolates or their epidemiological significance. here we present evidence that complex iv isolates display significantly higher levels of cytotoxicity against a variety of cell lines in vitro. for a subset of complex iv strains that were isolated from humans with respiratory illness and represent distinct sequence types, we also demonstrate that hypercytotoxicity in vitro correlates with hypervirulence in vivo, and that both phenotypes are dependent on the bsc t3ss and the btea effector.

to investigate the mechanistic basis for the quantitative differences in btea-dependent cytotoxicity observed between complex i and complex iv strains, we took a genetic approach which is both simple and definitive. in the experiment in figure 3a, we show that when the rb <dig> btea allele is expressed in Δbtea derivatives of rb <dig> or hypercytotoxic complex iv strains , the cytotoxicity profile of the parental strain is maintained. thus, hypercytotoxicity is not due to differences in the specific activity of the btea products. additionally, the examination of culture supernatants also failed to detect differences in the t3ss secretome that could account for increased virulence. although it is possible that one or more novel effectors that augment cytotoxicity are expressed by complex iv strains at levels that escape detection, it is also possible, and perhaps even likely, that differences in regulation are at play. we have previously shown that loci encoding btea and bsc t3ss apparatus components and chaperones are regulated by the bvgas phosphorelay through an alternative ecf-sigma factor, btrs  <cit> . in addition to transcriptional control, the partner-switching proteins btru, btrv and btrw regulate the secretion machinery through a complex series of protein-protein interactions governed by serine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation  <cit> . comparative expression analysis shows that differential expression of the bvgas regulon correlates with human-adaptation by b. pertussis and b. parapertussis <cit> . in a similar vein, it seems reasonable to suspect that t3ss regulatory systems may be adapting to the evolutionary pressures that are shaping b. bronchiseptica lineages.

although both cytotoxicity and virulence are known, or likely, to be t3ss-dependent phenotypes in all strains examined, the correlation between lethality in mice and ldh release in vitro was not absolute. strain d <dig> was highly cytotoxic to all cell lines examined , yet it was relatively avirulent following respiratory infection . this is not unexpected given the fact that type iii secretion is only one of many virulence determinants required for pathogenesis  <cit> , and b. bronchiseptica isolates are known to have diverse phenotypic properties despite their high degree of genetic similarity. a recent study by buboltz et al.  <cit>  identified two complex i isolates belonging to st <dig> which also appeared to have heightened virulence when compared to rb <dig>  in particular, the ld <dig> of these strains was 40- to 60-fold lower than rb <dig> and based on transcriptome analyses, hypervirulence was associated with upregulated expression of t3ss genes. the authors also observed a t3ss-dependent increase in cytotoxicity towards cultured j774a. <dig> macrophage cells. it will be important to determine whether complex iv isolates do indeed share common virulence properties, or if the observations reported here represent heterogeneity distributed throughout b. bronchiseptica lineages.

numerous studies have demonstrated the ability of the bsc t3ss to exert potent cytotoxicity against a remarkably broad range of mammalian cell types, regardless of their species or tissue of origin  <cit> . this was considered to be a defining feature of the b. bronchiseptica t3ss. a <dig> cells, derived from human alveolar epithelial cells, are the first cell line to our knowledge shown to be resistant to intoxication by rb <dig>  the finding that complex iv isolates kill these cells with high efficiency provides particularly compelling evidence for their hypercytotoxicity.

to begin to address the comparative genomics of b. bronchiseptica lineages, we analyzed the genome sequences of  <dig> complex iv and  <dig> complex i strains. the observation that homologs of the qsebc locus are present in multiple complex iv strains was an intriguing discovery, as these genes encode a catecholamine-responsive virulence control system in e. coli and salmonella <cit> . since the locus is missing in two complex iv strains , one of which is also hypervirulent , qseb and qsec do not satisfy the criteria for either complex iv-specific or hypervirulence-associated genes. no loci were found to be uniquely present in all complex iv isolates, and we also failed to identify loci that are present in all members of the hypervirulent subset of complex iv strains and are predicted to encode factors involved in virulence. it is probable that there are multiple pathways to hypervirulence, and that polymorphisms between conserved virulence and regulatory genes play a role in this phenotype as well as the apparent predilection of complex iv isolates for human infectivity.

a particularly relevant question that remains to be addressed involves the burden of human disease currently caused by b. bronchiseptica. diagnostic methods in common use that rely on pcr-based identification efficiently detect b. pertussis and b. parapertussis, but not b. bronchiseptica <cit> . it is therefore possible that b. bronchiseptica respiratory infections are more common than previously appreciated, and it is intriguing to speculate that complex iv isolates may be responsible for undiagnosed respiratory infections in humans.

CONCLUSIONS
this work provides an initial characterization of the virulence properties of human-associated b. bronchiseptica. in in vitro cytotoxicity assays using several mammalian cell lines, wild type complex iv isolates showed significantly increased cytotoxicity as compared to a panel of complex i strains. some complex iv isolates were remarkably cytotoxic, resulting in ldh release levels that were 10- to 20-fold greater than the prototype complex i strain rb <dig>  while infection of c57/bl <dig> mice with rb <dig> resulted in asymptomatic respiratory infection, a subset of complex iv strains displayed hypervirulence which was characterized by rapidly progressive pneumonia with massive peribronchiolitis, perivasculitis, and alveolitis. although in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo hypervirulence are both dependent upon t3ss activity and the btea effector, the exact mechanistic basis for quantitative differences in cytotoxicity observed between complex i and complex iv b. bronchiseptica isolates is currently unresolved. a limited comparative genomic analysis did not reveal unique genetic determinants that could potentially explain the virulence phenotype associated with the complex iv isolates examined. our observations of hypervirulence in tissue culture and animal models of infection suggests that further study of these potentially emerging human pathogens is warranted.
