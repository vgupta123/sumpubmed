BACKGROUND
human estrogen receptor alpha  is an essential nuclear receptor regulating female development and reproductive functions. in the context of breast cancer, both herα protein concentration and mrna abundance have been shown to be associated with specific cancer sub-types and to influence survival rates  <cit> 

estrogen receptor is known to bind dna at estrogen responsive elements  and to activate transcription of its target genes, in particular early estrogen-responsive genes  <cit> . it was also shown that some herα targets, such as c-myc, lack the ere, but instead contain ap <dig> or sp <dig> binding sites, which appear to be essential for transcription in vitro  <cit> . studies about how the estrogen receptor eventually induces transcription of its target genes have lead to the identification of complex interactions between herα and a large number of cofactors  <cit> .

several recent approaches have been developed to identify herα targets in vivo on a genome-wide scale. correlation studies have used mrna expression levels  <cit>  from compendia of cancer samples to identify estrogen induced genes in cells. other approaches have resulted in refined binding motifs from sequence analysis  <cit> , novel candidate regulatory elements from comparative genomics, and most recently high-resolution maps of binding sites from chip-chip  <cit> .

from chip-chip studies, carroll and colleagues  <cit>  drew the conclusion that estrogen receptor can activate transcription when bound to distal enhancers and that it is assisted in this function by the transcription factor foxa <dig>  the authors eventually refined their conclusions stating that foxa <dig> can translate epigenetic signatures into cell-type specific transcriptional programs; i.e. foxa <dig> recruits herα, or androgen receptor, which, in turn, may act as stabilizer for foxa <dig> binding  <cit> . enrichment of foxa <dig> binding seems to be most evident around intergenic ere's, and almost undetectable at promoters  <cit> .

another approach uses a chip paired end ditags  technique to map herα binding sites  <cit> . the authors found that the majority of herα binding events happen in intragenic regions, in particular in introns; herα sites at promoters are capable of inducing transcription, as are herα binding sites in distal enhancers, as previously reported  <cit> . the chip-pet investigation  <cit>  found poor conservation of estrogen receptor binding sites between human and mouse, and overlaps in the consensus motifs of herα and putative transcription factor partners such as ap <dig> 

a previous study  <cit>  isolated  <dig> transcriptionally active genomic sites which recruit herα. it showed one case of an ere located  <dig>  kb downstream of the first transcriptional start site of a target gene. moreover, the presence of the sp <dig> transcription factor at the promoter of genes induced by herα was shown by chip. nevertheless, sp <dig> binding was not influenced by estradiol, pointing to independent mechanisms of recruitment. further expression profiling analyses  <cit>  tackled the same question employing an inhibitor of transcription, cycloheximide, to discriminate between primary and secondary targets. the authors concluded that ap <dig> and gc-box binding factors such as sp <dig>  are enriched around the transcription start sites of up-regulated primary targets. thus local nucleotide composition seems to play a role in defining active ere's. this observation is supported by in silico investigations  <cit>  reporting that extending the herα pwm with cg rich flanks improves the prediction of functional herα binding sites. transcriptional regulation of herα secondary target genes is, on the other hand, controlled by e2f, a transcription factor involved in cell-cycle regulation  <cit> .

in this study we investigate mechanisms of target gene regulation by herα by studying the relationship between eres and gene expression. for this, we combine independent genome-wide chip analyses with large-scale microarray studies of estrogen response as well as genomic sequence analysis. in this context, we also investigate the roles of binding sites of known cofactors such as fox and sp <dig> in silico. our analysis confirms important characteristics of eres such as their intergenic localization, the presence of cofactor sites, and gc biased local nucleotide composition. unexpected however, was the finding that stronger and weaker herα sites show different localization patterns with respect to annotated transcripts. specifically, weak sites are enriched near transcription start sites, while stronger sites show no positional bias. we then study the relationship between binding and expression patterns and find binding sites downstream of the transcription start site to be equally good or better predictors of herα-mediated expression than upstream sites. studying fox and sp <dig> cofactor sites near herα chip sites shows that both factors reinforce the response to estrogen. taken together, our results argue against significant herα activity as a promoter bound transcription factor, and rather favor the long-range interaction model involving sp <dig> as the main mechanism of herα-mediated response to estrogen. finally we compile a reliable set of direct targets related to both normal and pathological states using our integrative approach.

RESULTS
strong chip-chip sites co-localize with strong herα consensus sites
we analyzed chip data for herα measured by affymetrix tiling array  <cit>  using our signal estimation method slm  <cit> . this method provides a quantitative measure  of the chip enrichment that allows strong and weak signals to be differentiated. as a first assessment of the fidelity of the binding regions, we measure the presence of canonical eres  within  <dig> bp of mapped chip sites. for this, we designed a hidden markov model  model for herα binding, allowing multiple non-overlapping eres per sequence . specifically, we compute posterior probability to find eres at each position along the  <dig> kbp sequences centered on the sites identified by slm. we observe that the expected occurrences of eres show a monotone sigmoidal dependency on the corresponding t-scores . this behavior allows to define cutoffs for selecting high confidence chip sites in a natural manner: for t~ <dig> each site has on average one ere, which is double the number found for t~ <dig>  the actual cutoffs were determined from a sigmoidal fit to the median occurrence in function of t-scores . we thus define a set  <dig> high stringency sites with t =  <dig> and a set of  <dig> lower stringency with 10<t< <dig>  the latter group could reflect weaker binding sites stabilized by the presence of co-factors, or give indications of cross-linking of long-range interactions between herα and other factors  <cit> . interestingly, we find that the genomic coordinates of eres  fall within a narrow window of the estimated positions of chip sites. namely, 80% of eres resides within  <dig> bp from the position of maximal chip enrichment as modeled in the slm method . this means that although the resolution of chip is limited by the size of the fragments, typically about  <dig> kb, the position of the binding site occurs in 80% of cases within  <dig> bp of the maximum enrichment.

nucleotide bias near herα sites
studying the nucleotide composition around herα binding sites requires a precise mapping of the herα motif on the genomic sequence, so that sites can be aligned with respect to eres. we inspect all high and lower stringency sites with at least one ere occurrence  within  <dig> kbp of the reported chip-chip site. we find that the sequence at these sites is gc-rich  compared to the genomic background composition  and varies with t-score, the maximum gc-content being found for sites with t~ <dig> . moreover, the average sequence composition exhibits an increase in gc-content of ~4% in  <dig> bp region immediately around the herα binding site . we note that this is not due to the bias in the ere itself  but due to the flanking bases. in addition, within the studied window, the gc bias stays higher for the weaker sites, consistent with the higher frequency of weak sites near transcription start sites .

localization of chip-chip sites relative to genome annotations
to further characterize herα sites, we examine their localization relative to known genes. we use ucsc annotations  and find that high stringency herα binding sites  occur both in intergenic regions  and along genes  . interestingly, we observe an enrichment of low stringency sites  binding sites within  <dig> bp of transcription start sites  which was not reported previously. in particular 12% of sites within  <dig> bkp of a tss are closer than  <dig> bp to the tss . in comparison, no detectable enrichment is present near the poly-adenylation site  . finally, a remarkable fraction of sites,  <dig> %, lies in repeats . this fraction is higher than the  <dig> % reported by previous analysis of the chip-chip data  <cit> , but not as high as the  <dig> % reported by chip-pet  <cit> .

to be associated with a transcript, a site is required to lie between - <dig> kb and + <dig> kb of the annotated boundaries . a complete list is available upon request to the authors. the smoothing used in slm is σ =  <dig> bp  <cit> .

the number of binding sites downstream of the tss is a good indicator of herα-mediated induction
to investigate how the occupation of herα binding sites leads to gene induction, we assess the influence of herα binding on expression phenotypes. the assessment requires appropriate assignment of a binding site to the target gene: generally a binding site is considered to influence the expression of a gene if it lies within a predefined window around the tss or the gene. previous studies  <cit>  have used different windows: tight cis-regulatory regions upstream of tss  <cit> ;  <dig> kbp windows around the promoters of responsive genes  <cit> ;  <dig> kbp around the promoters of cancer related genes  <cit> . here we assess which definition is best at discriminating induced genes. for this, we quantify the expression response to estrogen for each transcript using four independent datasets probing different aspects of estrogen signaling . we will focus mainly on two datasets: an expression compendium of cancer tissue samples  <cit>  and a study on mcf <dig> cells where secondary target activation has been blocked by addition of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis  <cit> . for breast cancer samples, we expect that primary targets of esr <dig> will correlate with esr <dig> mrna abundance as protein concentration and mrna abundance have been shown to associate with cancer sub-types  <cit>  . taken together, the different experimental settings give us a broad picture of the activity of herα and its targets. we compare the various assignments of sites using receiver operating characteristic  analysis, a commonly used methodology to assess the tradeoff between the sensitivity and specificity of predictors.

we first compare the performance of proximal and upstream sites vs. proximal and downstream binding sites. we find that the number of binding sites covering the  <dig> kbp downstream of the tss tend to be a better discriminator than the number in the equivalent upstream region. though the roc curves show little differences, the trend suggests that downstream sites yield higher sensitivity at almost identical specificity for each operative point . different sets of binding sites, i.e. high, low stringency chip sites, or chip-pet sites  <cit> , show slightly altered sensitivity and specificity, but the downstream sites perform consistently better than upstream sites . we remark that few genes have more than one site within  <dig> kbp of the tss, thus resulting in low sensitivity at high specificity; however, the set of genes with more than one site is highly enriched for direct targets, the enrichment being the slope of the line connecting the operative point to the origin.

secondly, we compare definitions with varying regulatory region sizes. we use the number of binding sites in the region as a discriminator for estrogen sensitive genes  and introduce the number of binding sites along the transcript as a new metric for herα-mediated gene induction. this definition refers to sites along the whole length of the transcript from  <dig> kbp upstream of the transcription start site to  <dig> kbp downstream of the poly-adenylation site. we observe that the operative points for the different definitions lie on the same envelope, bounded on the left side by the roc curve for the number of binding sites along the transcript . at equal sensitivity, the number of sites along the transcript achieves comparable or better specificity  than the other definitions in both expression datasets. taken together, these results show that erα sites located downstream of start sites are equally or more effective at inducing genes than upstream sites.

in a complementary analysis, we study the ranks of induction in function of the number of herα sites along transcripts. here the ranks are taken as the merged ranks from the cancer expression compendium and primary target datasets. we find that the ranks clearly correlate positively with the number of sites both for the chip-chip and chip-pet sites. the latter shows a more pronounced effect indicating that chip-pet sites occur with preference near strongly induced targets . the positive correlation is generally unchanged when we restrict the sites to those harboring a good instance of an ere, but note that it is increased in case of two chip-pet sites . thus sites with eres are only marginally more prone to lead to increased transcriptional response.

signatures of fox and sp <dig> cofactor sites near herα chip sites
though the ere is the dominant recognition sequence for strong chip sites , other transcription factors are also involved in the regulation of target genes by direct interaction with herα at its specific sites  <cit> . we test the contribution to gene induction by analyzing the presence or absence of co-factor sites. we map the cofactors sites based on their consensus sites by extending the cyclic hmm model to reported co-factors of herα: foxa <dig>  ap <dig> and sp <dig> . we also include e2f as this factor is known to regulate secondary targets of the herα signaling cascade  <cit> . we find the sp <dig> consensus to be most represented in low stringency chip sites , and observe a concurrent low expectation for foxa <dig> sites. for high stringency sequences , these two signals reach similar occurrences  and appear to follow a similar slowly increasing trend as the eres . at the stringencies implemented in our hmm, ap <dig> occurrences are uniform over the full range of t-scores while e2f motifs are rare , consistent with the role of e2f in the induction of secondary targets  <cit> . we find similar spatial profiles for the cofactor sites as in  <cit> , i.e. a bias towards the position of the maximal chip-chip signal for the eres , for foxa <dig> sites and for ap <dig> sites . in further characterizing the foxa <dig> sites, we find no difference between the log-likelihood of the foxa <dig> in the high-stringency sites and the log-likelihood of other motifs from the fox factors . the observed signal is thus to be attributed to a generic fox site rather than specifically to foxa <dig> 

induced genes have chip sites with fox or sp <dig> sites
in order to study the dependency of herα mediated induction on co-factors, we stratify the chip sites along the transcript according to the presence of fox and sp <dig>  fox has been reported to be involved in the regulation of herα target genes, in particular through remodeling of chromatin prior to herα recruitment  <cit> . on the other hand, sp <dig> is a gc-box bound enhancer associated with the activity of the transcription machinery  <cit>  and frequently localized in the proximity of tsss  <cit> . as expected, we find a strong enrichment of sp <dig> sites for sites near promoters, compared to gc-rich binding sites located in non-promoter proximal regions . the analysis of herα sites with eres, stratified according to fox sites, shows that the correlation with induction is preserved independently of fox sites. however, the presence of fox sites shifts the distribution toward higher induction in the case of the chip-pet sites . separately we also consider herα chip sites around the tsss harboring gc-boxes . clearly, the set of targets with one binding site harboring a gc-box is strikingly enriched for induced genes, both in the case of chip-chip mapping and in the case of chip-pet mapping . together, the analysis of putative cofactor sites is consistent with an activating role for the fox factor next to eres, while the role of sp <dig> sites in mediating response to estrogen at promoter proximal chip sites is very clear, irrespective of eres.

high confidence herα target genes
as reported targets tend to differ across experiments  <cit> , we used these multiple datasets to identify  <dig> genes with at least two high-stringency chip-chip sites, one chip-pet site along their full-length transcript and ranking in the top 10% of herα responding genes .  <dig> of these genes have previously been reported as direct targets of herα  <cit>  and they have been associated with the transduction of estrogen signaling activity. all of these  <dig> direct targets show the presence of at least one ere along their transcript, often accompanied by one or more fox motifs. three known targets also exhibit sp <dig> motifs in their promoter regions .

each selected target shows at least two high stringency chip-chip sites and one chip-pet site along its transcript. in addition it scores in the 10% highest ranks in the combined rank list .

of the remaining  <dig> genes,  <dig> genes  are part of the estrogen signaling pathway, and two are involved in the development of the upper body: with the only exception of arsg, these genes exhibit a high number of eres and of fox sites . eight genes are associated with cancer  <cit> , or appeared upregulated in previous cancer studies  <cit> . two of them  are specifically associated with breast cancer  <cit> . we observe that these genes tend to have both eres and fox sites, but no clear sp <dig> site at promoters. in addition, the number of eres seems to be higher than the number of fox sites. except for c6orf <dig>  a  <dig> kbp long open reading frame located upstream of the esr <dig> gene, the remaining ten herα targets have not yet been associated to estrogen signaling or cancer activity. though it is unclear how these targets may be implicated in estrogen signaling, we find that anxa <dig>  arl <dig> and atrnl <dig> are recruited during vesicle trafficking and signaling, probably performing relevant functions downstream of the estrogen response. further experiments will be needed to clarify their role downstream of herα.

discussion
properties of herα binding sites measured in chip experiments
we analyzed raw genome-wide chip-chip data  <cit>  using our previously developed slm algorithm  <cit> . one important advantage of this method is the ability to rank sites according to their strength . this gives an approximate quantification of the residency time, and allows us to stratify our analyses accordingly. the procedure has highlighted an interesting difference in the localization patterns between low and high stringency sites: low stringency sites are enriched in close proximity to tsss, while strong sites show no bias in localization as previously discussed  <cit> . expectedly we find that the number of predicted eres increases with the stringency of the observed sites, with 50% of highest stringency sites showing a good match to a full ere. this is less than the 71% reported in a chip-pet study  <cit>  which used a comparable definition of consensus match. this difference is in line with the notion that chip-pet sites are enriched in higher stringency sites as compared to the chip-chip sites  <cit> . finally we describe a nucleotide composition profile showing a peak in gc bias within a narrow window  around the eres; we note that this effect is uncoupled from cpg islands as for t> <dig> only 5%  of the sites considered overlap with cpg islands  and the gc bias is unchanged if these are removed. our findings are in line with previous bioinformatics analyses  <cit>  which showed that regulatory regions have a biased nucleotide composition compared to the rest of the genome, in particular showing higher gc content than expected. in addition,  <cit>  stated that eres with cg-rich flanks are better predictors of functional regulatory binding sites. considering that these authors performed an unbiased search of the genome, their result matches our observation that both low- and high-stringency chip-chip sites are enriched in cg-content relative to the background .

assigning herα binding sites to target transcripts
linking chip-chip sites to expression phenotypes requires mapping of sites to transcripts. this is a notoriously difficult problem in higher eukaryotic organisms due to the potential long-range regulation from distal enhancers. in the absence of a better solution, the current practice is to assign a site to a tss according to proximity, using ad hoc window sizes, both symmetrically and non-symmetrically centered around tsss. we assessed a variety of proposed definitions in their ability to predict expression status of target genes and found downstream sites to be equally good or better predictors of herα-mediated expression than upstream sites. while it has been reported that chip sites tend to be symmetrically distributed around tsss for a variety of transcription factors  <cit> , it is likely that the increased performance of downstream sites is due to fewer ambiguous assignments to transcripts when genes are closely spaced.

functional signatures of cofactor elements near herα sites
several transcription regulators and chromatin remodeling factors have been shown to interact with herα. recently,  <cit>  demonstrated that herα and foxa <dig> interact over long ranges while  <cit>  argued that herα and foxa <dig> may reciprocally help each other in stabilizing binding to dna. moreover ere independent gene activation relying on herα/sp <dig> complexes at gc-rich sites has been reported  <cit> . we therefore used our metrics to study the influence of fox and sp <dig> cofactor sites near herα chip sites on the induction of target genes. consistent with the aforementioned herα/sp <dig> mode of regulation we find that promoter proximal sites are much more effective at inducing expression when they co-occur with an sp <dig> site.

two models for herα target regulation
taken together, these data suggest two hypotheses:  weak dna interactions, in particular at promoters, represent degenerate eres bound by herα and compensated by the presence of cofactors;  alternatively, these weak chip signals are the result of cross-linking of long-range interaction of herα with its promoter-bound partners. both scenarios are consistent with our analysis. in support of the first we showed that promoter proximal chip binding sites, i.e. in centered windows of  <dig> kbp, are associated with gene induction . moreover, genes with sp <dig> motifs in their promoter sequences show strong estrogenic response independently of eres . however, our finding that consideration of downstream sites far from promoters increases the selection of induced genes would favor the second model in which herα-mediated induction of target genes is more prominently regulated through long-range interactions. indeed, we find that the number of chip sites along the transcript is the best discriminator for highly responsive genes . in this analysis, the occurrence of cofactor motifs, i.e. fox, only marginally improves the discrimination of highly induced target genes .

data integration and high confidence herα targets
an admitted caveat of independent location and expression studies is that the list of predicted targets can be quite large  <cit> . crossing results from several studies will likely form a core group of the most robust targets. in this context, we applied stringent criteria to define a list of high confidence direct targets. we found that there was a distinction between targets associated to normal conditions and targets which are most prominent in pathological states. namely, known targets and targets related to estrogen signaling and fore-body development are rich in both eres and fox motifs, but they also show the presence of sp <dig> sites . on the other hand, targets that have been reported in cancer studies, probably reflecting abnormal herα activity at binding sites, exhibit many eres but no sp <dig> motifs at promoters and few fox sites along the transcripts .

CONCLUSIONS
we investigated the influence of herα binding patterns, as detected by chip, on expression phenotypes in cell culture and cancer tissues, measured by microarray. furthermore, the availability of a chip-chip dataset  <cit>  and a chip-pet dataset  <cit>  enabled the direct comparison of the two technologies. chip-chip being sensitive to cross-linking, the methodology can be informative in detecting weaker or transient enrichment at promoters. the present study highlights how such weak sites show different functional signatures from the stronger sites. chip-pet, on the other hand, selects stronger sites and offers higher positional resolution. localizing binding elements in silico using genomic sequence analysis in conjunction with chip helps stratify sites and highlight relevant features underlying induction by her.

taken together, our analyses support the model that herα mediated response to estrogen signaling occurs over long-range interactions with sp <dig> or other promoter-proximal cofactors. the strength of the response is in quantitative linkage with the number of herα binding sites along target transcripts. we found that the intragenic fraction of bound herα is the best discriminator of estrogen responsive genes. in particular, our main finding is that the number of herα binding sites along the transcripts of target genes is correlated with the strength of the response. this highlights the quantitative nature of the herα-mediated response to estrogen.
