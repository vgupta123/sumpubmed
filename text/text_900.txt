BACKGROUND
research using in vitro cell culture methods has a number of limitations to a complete understanding of biological systems in vivo. the primary somatic cells, however, are valuable tools to enable the study of a variety of cellular and biochemical functions under tightly controlled experimental conditions. one limitation to primary somatic cell use that must be managed is their finite proliferative capacity due to permanent growth arrest known as replicative senescence  <cit> . replicative senescence is known to be triggered by two inter-dependent mechanisms; one is activation of two tumor suppressor pathways , the second is a shortening of the telomeres due to an end-replication problem during chromosome replication  <cit> . to overcome these limitations, much effort has been put into the establishment of immortalized cell lines that have an unlimited replicative potential and normal cellular functions  <cit> . the loss of a tumor suppressor pathway, such as inactivation of p <dig> and rb by simian virus  <dig> large t antigen , bypasses senescent-mediated growth arrest and ultimately extends cellular lifespan  <cit> . the maintenance of telomere length by the overexpression of human telomerase  is known to avoid replicative senescence and to establish immortalized cell lines from various species  <cit> .

because of the close physiological and anatomical similarities with humans compared to other non-rodent species, miniature pig breeds have increasingly been used as models for research in physiology, immunology, toxicology, nutrition, drug metabolism, and various diseases. although the miniature pig breeds are currently used as general surgical models for many organs, for cardiovascular research, digestive system models, transplantation and xenografts  <cit> , their primary and immortal cell lines have rarely been established. therefore, we have conducted research to establish primary and immortal cell lines derived from miniature  and domestic pigs  to use as in vitro model systems to explore and better understand the cellular and biochemical mechanisms that underlie in vivo physiological events.

RESULTS
in vitro growth characteristics of primary fibroblast cells derived from the miniature and domestic pig
we established two independent lines of primary and immortalized porcine fibroblast cells from miniature  and domestic  pigs, respectively . in the presence of 10% fbs, the growth rate of the early passage pf cells  was shown to be more rapid than that of the mpf cells , whereas both cells failed to proliferate in the presence of  <dig> % fbs, thereby indicating that both cells require fbs for proliferation . in contrast to primary cells, immortalized mpf cells  grew faster than immortalized pf cells  , implying possible genetic alterations that enable to change in cellular growth property during immortalization process. we next determined the in vitro lifespan of primary mpf and pf cells using a standard 3t <dig> protocol. as shown in figure 2a, there was a marked difference in the growth curves of the mpf and pf cells. for mpf cells, replicative senescence appeared at two distinct passages  as judged by a flat morphology and senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity  , and a growth rate was shown to decrease until passage  <dig>  but rapidly increase after passage  <dig>  it is noteworthy that less than 35% of mpf cells at passage  <dig> through passage  <dig> displayed sa-β-gal-positive . for the pf cells, the replicative senescence appeared at two distinct passages . taken together, the mpf cells grew at a slower rate and had a shorter in vitro lifespan compared to the pf cells. since the mpf and pf cells, after passages  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, grew continuously without a detectable senescent phenotype, we speculate that both the mpf and pf cells by passage  <dig> would be spontaneously immortalized.

p <dig> and p21waf <dig> expression and doxorubicin-resistant cell viability of primary and immortalized mpf and pf cells
since it has been well documented that p <dig> gene, a cell cycle checkpoint and tumor suppressor, was commonly inactivated in numerous immortal and transformed cells  <cit> , we determined expression levels of p <dig> and p21waf <dig>  one of p53-downstream target genes, as well as biological function of p <dig> in the primary and immortalized mpf and pf cells. as shown in figure 3a, expression level of p <dig> protein was found to be similar in the primary and immortalized pf cells, while p21waf <dig> was relatively upregulated in the immortalized pf cells compared to the primary pf cells. however, we think that expression levels of p <dig> and p21waf <dig> proteins might be more elevated in the immortalized pf cells compared to primary pf cells as normalized to α-tubulin level . when primary pf cells were treated with doxorubicin  that enables to stabilize and activate p <dig> protein, p <dig> protein level was shown to be markedly elevated with concomitant increase of p21waf <dig> . interestingly, the expression of p21waf was relatively decreased in the immortalized pf cells treated with doxorubicin .

however, like other immortalized or transformed cells, the expression of p <dig> protein was shown to be markedly elevated in the immortalized mpf cells, whereas p21waf <dig> protein was dramatically downregulated in these cells as compared to the primary mpf cells . in addition, when primary mpf cells were treated with doxorubicin, p <dig> protein was shown to be markedly elevated in these cells with concomitantly slight increase of p21waf <dig>  whereas expression of the p <dig> protein was not changed by a dna damage response, and p21waf <dig> protein was barely detectable in the immortal mpf cells, regardless of doxorubicin . furthermore, in the presence of doxorubicin , the immortalized mpf cells were more resistant to cell death as compared to primary mpf cells , whereas immortalized pf cells showed slightly increased resistance to doxorubicin  as compared to primary pf cells . taken together, these results indicate that immortalized mpf cells, but not immortalized pf cells, may be defective for the p <dig> regulatory function.

transformed phenotype and increased chromosome abnormality in the immortalized mpf cell line
to address whether primary and immortal mpf and pf cells have a transformed property, we studied the anchorage-independent growth of primary mpf and pf cells by growing the cells in a soft-agar culture condition. as shown in figure 4a, immortal mpf , but not immortal pf cells, were enabled to grow in the soft-agar, suggesting that the immortalized mpf cells should possess a transformed property. as determined chromosome abnormality of the primary and immortal mpf and pf cells by a karyotyping ,  <dig> of the  <dig> immortalized mpf cells have abnormal chromosome numbers of 2n =  <dig>  on average, while all of primary mpf and pf as well as immortalized pf cells were shown to have normal chromosome number of 2n =  <dig> on average .

growth properties and in vitro lifespan of cells transduced with sv40lt and htert
cellular immortalization and transformation have been shown to associate with loss of p <dig> and gain of telomerase activity  <cit> . therefore, we transduced sv40lt  and htert  into primary mpf and pf cells in order to determine a possible causal role of the activated p <dig> or telomerase activity for a shorter lifespan and earlier senescent-mediated growth arrest of the primary mpf cells as compared to primary pf cells. growth rate of the sv40lt- or htert-transduced pf cells was shown to be faster than that of the sv40lt- or htert-transduced mpf cells in the presence of 10% fbs, whereas these cells failed to proliferate in the presence of  <dig> % fbs . in contrast, the sv40lt+htert-transduced mpf cells were shown to proliferate relatively faster than sv40lt+htert-transduced pf cells in the presence of 10% fbs, whereas these cells failed to grow in the presence of  <dig> % fbs . in examining their in vitro lifespan by the 3t <dig> protocol, both sv40lt-transduced mpf and pf cells proliferated continuously and without any detectable senescent phenotype , whereas transduction of htert into primary mpf and pf cells failed to extend their in vitro lifespan . interestingly, the htert-transduced mpf and pf cells were shown to become senescent at passages  <dig> and  <dig>  and to enter crisis stage from passages  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. meanwhile, transduction of sv40lt+htert into primary mpf and pf cells, like transduction of sv40lt alone, exhibited an extension of their in vitro lifespan . of interest, the growth rate of the sv40lt+htert-transduced mpf cells were shown to be faster than their counterpart pf cells. pf and mpf cells transduced with sv40lt or sv40lt+htert have continuously proliferated beyond passage  <dig> without any detectable senescent barriers and we are of the opinion that these cells should be immortalized.

since htert, distinct from sv40lt, failed to extend cellular lifespan, we examined expression and relative activity of htert in the control and htert-transduced cells. although htert mrna was found to be expressed as determined by rt-pcr, the htert activity did not increase in the htert-transduced cells as compared to nontransduced cells . furthermore, we found that endogenous telomerase activity in the primary and immortal mpf and pf cells was similar to that in the primary human bj fibroblast cells . these results suggest that activation of the telomerase might not be necessary for cellular immortalization at least in the mpf cells of this study, whereas loss of p <dig> should be sufficient for immortalization and p <dig> activation in these cells might be a major determinant for the replicative senescence.

discussion
although numerous immortalized cell lines have been established from various domestic animals, such as bovine, equine, ovine, avian, canine and porcine  <cit> , here, we first report establishment of the spontaneous immortalized cells derived from miniature pigs.

one of the major regulatory pathways for replicative senescence is known to come from activation of p <dig>  one of the best characterized cell cycle checkpoints and tumor suppressors  <cit> . p <dig> functions as transcriptional activator or repressor and plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and transformation by tightly regulating expression of the various cell cycle negative regulators and apoptosis-inducing factors such as p21waf <dig> and bax, respectively  <cit> . it has been documented that p <dig> activity is markedly elevated in the senescent cells, whereas loss of p <dig> is sufficient to escape senescent barriers and ultimately become immortalized in a variety of cells  <cit> .

a shortening of telomere length by inactivation of telomerase should also be associated with senescent-mediated growth arrest in a variety of species  <cit> . in normal somatic cells, the telomere shortening occurs in each cell division as a result of the end-replication problem of dna polymerase  <cit> . critically shortened telomeres trigger loss of chromosomal integrity and concomitantly activate dna damage response that eventually results in irreversible cell cycle arrest  through activation of p <dig> function  <cit> .

in the present study, the primary mpf cells showed slower growth rate and shorter in vitro lifespan compared to the primary pf cells. the shorter lifespan in the primary mpf cells might be caused by activation of p <dig> as judged by relative expression levels of p <dig> and p21waf <dig> . although expression of p <dig> was elevated in immortalized mpf cells compared to their counterpart cells, expression of p21waf <dig> was shown to be dramatically decreased in these cells. however, there is a question of how p21waf <dig> is downregulated in the immortalized mpf cells possessing a significantly higher steady-state level of p <dig> protein. this converse expression pattern of p <dig> and p21waf <dig> in the immortalized mpf cells has been commonly observed in other immortalized cells  <cit> . it is also well-characterized that when p <dig> protein is inactivated by point mutation, its stability is known to increase owing to evasion of mdm2-dependent ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis  <cit> . therefore, we speculate that p <dig> function in the immortalized mpf cells might be inactivated by point mutation.

in accordance with previous data  <cit> , our results have indicated that the activation of p <dig> signaling should be a major determinant for the replicative senescence in the cells derived from pigs, because inactivation of the p <dig> signaling by sv40lt was shown sufficient for both primary mpf and pf cells to escape from the senescent barrier. however, we can not rule out that a variety of other genetic alterations, such as inactivation of rb by sv40lt or less well characterized associations of p300/cbp and bub <dig> with sv40lt, might be also involved in cellular immortalization  <cit> . furthermore, since the spontaneously immortalized pf cells are recognized to possess functional p <dig> activity, it is also possible that cellular immortalization of pig cells might be occurred by external microenvironmental changes  <cit>  or other endogenous genetic alterations such as loss of ink4a/arf tumor suppressor, without loss of p <dig> function  <cit> .

in the case of telomerase activity, endogenous telomerase activity in the all primary and immortalized pig cells used in the present study was found to possess minimum basal levels that are similar to that in the human bj fibroblast cells. moreover, we failed to reconstitute telomerase activity in the pf and mpf cells by overexpression of human telomerase catalytic subunit , although expression of exogenous htert in those cells was verified by rt-pcr . a couple of research groups have demonstrated that most somatic cells derived from pigs, unlike human somatic cells, are known to possess endogenous telomerase activity  <cit> . however, recent reports have also demonstrated that endogenous telomerase activity was shown to be restricted in the particular tissues/organs of pigs, and introduction of htert failed to reconstitute telomerase activity in the cells derived from pig  <cit> . these results suggest that telomerase activity might be required for cellular immortalization in the pig cells, depending on cell types, tissue origins or culture conditions.

since it has been documented that p <dig> protein is stabilized and activated through its phosphorylation under the various cellular insults such as dna damage and oncogenic stresses  <cit> , the relatively increased p <dig> level in the primary mpf cells of early passage  compared to primary counterpart pf cells  reflects that the primary mpf cells might be prone to possess relatively higher cellular stresses, compared to the primary pf cells. among various cellular stresses that enable to activate p <dig>  chromosome-spindle attachment might be improperly regulated in the primary mpf cells, by which a relatively higher steady-state level of the p <dig> protein would be maintained in these cells. this speculation is further supported in that cells containing abnormal chromosome numbers  are dramatically increased in the immortalized mpf cells possessing inactivated p <dig> function, and deregulation of chromosome-spindle attachment could activate not only p53-dependent checkpoint pathway but also stimulate replicative senescence  <cit> . therefore, we assume that the loss of the p <dig> activity in the immortalized mpf cells should increase chromosome abnormality, ultimately leading to cellular transformation.

CONCLUSIONS
collectively, the results of this study demonstrate a number of molecular and cellular biological differences between primary and immortalized cells derived from domestic and miniature pigs. primary mpf cells showed relatively slower growth and shorter in vitro lifespan compared to the pf cells. furthermore, activation of p <dig> function might be a major cause to display relatively earlier senescent phenotype and slower growth property in the mpf cells as compared to pf cells. in contrast to immortalized pf cells, immortalized mpf cells showed the loss of p <dig> function and the increased chromosomal abnormality, which might lead these cells to be transformed.
