BACKGROUND
rehmannia glutinosa l. is a perennial herbaceous species belonging to the scrophulariaceae family. its economic importance results from the medicinal activity present in extracts of its tuberous roots  <cit> . because of a lack of known undesirable side effects and its relatively low price, the species is extensively used in traditional chinese clinical practice. its prime production region is the huai area of central china, but the climatic and edaphic conditions in jiaozuo  are also conducive for the cultivation of a high quality product. after one season of production, however, disease build-up  forces the land to be cultivated with other crops for a period of 15- <dig> years  <cit> . even in the absence of disease pressure, attempts to continuously crop over several seasons have failed to overcome the major decline in productivity, as the tubers are increasingly replaced by fibrous roots, which are unable to develop into tubers  <cit> . much of the past research aimed at identifying the causative factors for this continuous cropping yield decline has been focused on the physiological activity and autotoxicity of the root exudates  <cit> . however, the molecular basis of the species' sensitivity to its own exudate remains unknown.

mirnas  underlie a number of biological phenomena in the animal, plant and virus kingdoms  <cit> , largely at the level of post-transcriptional gene regulation  <cit> . as their sequences are so highly conserved across the eukaryotes, they are believed to represent an evolutionarily ancient component of gene regulation. they operate via their complementarity to a stretch of mrna sequence, and affect the level of gene expression by targeting the mrna molecule for degradation. the short stretch of sequence present in an mirna means that many probably interact with a number of independent mrnas. commonly, the mirna target sequence lies within a coding region, although there are examples of sites lying in either the 3' or 5' untranslated region  <cit> . the spectrum of functions now known to be mirna-regulated is very diverse  <cit>  and includes many aspects of plant growth and development  <cit> .

our hypothesis here was that mirna activity may underlie some at least of the the problems associated with the continuous cropping of r. glutinosa. in order to gain a global picture of the mirna content of r. glutinosa, we have therefore employed a high throughput parallel sequencing platform  able to generate millions of short  reads with a high level of accuracy. we have applied this technology to enable the comparative profiling of the mirna content of plants in their first year of cropping  with those in their second year , with the intention of identifying mirnas expressed differentially in fp and sp plants.

RESULTS
sequencing and annotation of r. glutinosa mirnas
solexa sequencing of the fp and sp mirna libraries yielded, respectively,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> unfiltered sequence reads. of these  <dig> %  were fp-specific,  <dig> %  were sp-specific and  <dig> %  were their common respectively. the average number of occurrences of the sequences common to both libraries was  <dig> , while that of library-specific reads was not more than  <dig>  . after discarding the low quality reads, a total of  <dig> , <dig> fp and  <dig> , <dig> sp reads was retained. these sequences represented  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> unique clean reads in fp and sp, respectively. their size distribution  showed that ~94% of the sequences in both libraries were of length 20- <dig> nt, with the modal length of  <dig> nt and the third peak at  <dig> nt, consistent with the observed length distribution of mature plant mirnas  <cit> .

conserved mirnas
sequences homologous to non-coding sequences  were identified from a search of the genbank and the rfam <dig>  databases. this resulted in the allocation of  <dig> % of the fp and  <dig> % of the sp unique mirnas to this category. when the remaining sequences were queried against known mirna sequences, the outcome was the identification of  <dig>   and  <dig>   hits, accounting for, respectively,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the fp and sp libraries. a blastn search of the genic mirnas resulted in the identification of  <dig> sequences, belonging to  <dig> families. the extent of their conservation across the plant kingdom was shown by an alignment with the whole genome sequences of a. thaliana, soybean, rice, black poplar and grape . the most abundant sequences were mir156/ <dig>  mir <dig> and mir165/166; the former accounted for ~47% of all conserved mirnas in the fp library, while the most frequent single conserved sequence in the sp library was mir <dig>  . in both libraries, mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were moderately abundant. the five mirnas mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were absent from the sp library. it appeared therefore that the mirna population present in fp plants differed to some extent from that present in sp plants.

novel mirnas
a distinguishing feature of mirnas is the ability of their pre-mirna sequences to adopt the canonical stem-loop hairpin structure. after removal of the conserved mirnas,  <dig> , <dig> fp  and  <dig> , <dig>  sp sequences were aligned with the a. thaliana genome sequence, producing  <dig>   fp and  <dig>   sp sequences  whose flanking region  was amenable to secondary structure analysis. the application of a set of strict identification criteria for potential mirna loci  <cit>  resulted in the selection of  <dig> sequences  across the two libraries which could be considered as likely novel mirnas . except for mir <dig>  their frequency of occurrence was < <dig> , reflecting an expression level considerably lower than that of the majority of the conserved mirnas. when rt-pcr was applied to these  <dig> sequences, six were amplifiable from r. glutinosa cdna template .

differentially expressed mirnas
evidence for differential expression in fp and sp plants was sought by comparing the frequency of occurrence of the  <dig> conserved and six novel mirnas, based on a poisson distribution approach  <cit> . the  <dig> conserved  and three novel mirnas showing the greatest degree of differential expression are listed in table  <dig>  of these  <dig> sequences,  <dig> showed a greater than two fold difference in expression level between fp and sp plants. seven of them were more strongly expressed in sp than in fp plants. the expression levels of the most differentially expressed  mirnas were reanalysed using qrt-pcr. this confirmed that  <dig> of the former and two of the latter sequences were indeed differentially expressed in fp and sp plants , showing that frequency of occurrence in solexa runs produces a reasonably accurate prediction for expression level. expression levels of  <dig> mirnas  in roots were measured in different times . mir157a and mir167a were highly expressed in fp, while mir160a and mir <dig> were quite opposite, with strongly expressing in sp.

target prediction for the three differentially expressed novel mirnas
the target of most plant mirnas possesses a single perfect or near perfect complementary site in the coding region  <cit> . assuming this to be generally the case, the a. thaliana gene space was searched for complementarity with the sequences of the three differentially expressed novel mirnas. using a set of rules for predicting novel mirna potential target genes  <cit> , this exercise predicted seven potential targets, with mir <dig> and mir <dig> both targeting more than one gene . the targets encoded the following gene products: icu <dig> , a dna-directed dna polymerase, a magnesium transporter cora-like family protein, an atp synthase , a tir-nbs-lrr protein, a ziga <dig>  and a dc <dig> domain-containing protein.

function of the potential targets of differentially expressed mirnas
an indication of the genes responsible for the continuous cropping syndrome was sought by an inspection of the  <dig> potential targets of the  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas  in addition to the seven targets of the novel mirnas . gene ontology categories were assigned to all  <dig> putative targets according to their cellular component, their molecular function and the biological process they are involved in a. thaliana . with respect to molecular function, the targets fell largely into nine categories, with the three most over-represented being nucleic acid binding, metal ion binding and transcription factor activity. twelve biological processes were identified, with the three most frequent being the regulation of transcription, plant development and signal transduction. the potential targets for the  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas mainly involved transcription, plant development and signal transduction.

several of these targets may be directly or indirectly involved in the development of tuberous vs fibrous roots . for example, mir156/ <dig> targets an spl transcription factor, which when over-expressed in a. thaliana, produces an early flowering phenotype. the over-expression of mir156/ <dig> itself delays flowering  <cit> . thus it is possible that in r. glutinosa, a higher level of expression of mir156/ <dig>  could prolong root growth and development. the mir <dig> target is the auxin response factor arf <dig>  while those of mir <dig> are arf <dig> and arf <dig>  arf <dig> is a negative regulator, while arf <dig> and arf <dig> are positive regulators of adventitious rooting. these three arfs share overlapping expression domains, interact genetically and regulate one another's expression at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level  <cit> . since sp plants express more mir <dig> and less mir <dig> than fp plants, it is possible that the balance of arf protein present is altered by continuous cropping, and hence there is an effect on tuberous root expansion. the target of mir <dig> is the gene icu <dig>  which is negative regulator of floral homeotic genes in a. thaliana. its over-expression delays flowering, while its knock-out hastens it  <cit> . since this mirna is more highly expressed in sp than in fp plants, there may be a differential expression of icu <dig> and hence an effect on flowering time, with a knock-on effect on tuberous root expansion.

these predicted target genes were cloned in r. glutinosa  and registered as ests in ncbi.

overall, there was a suggestion that the expression of a number of mirna families may be correlated with the continuous cropping syndrome in r. glutinosa. whether these mirnas actually regulate key genes responsible for the syndrome will require experimental demonstration. the identification of these mirnas has nevertheless succeeded in providing leads for determining the molecular genetic basis of the continuous cropping syndrome in r. glutinosa.

CONCLUSIONS
here we have described the application of a combination of approaches to identify a set of  <dig> conserved  and six novel r. glutinosa mirnas, which are differentially, expressed in first and second year crops. we believe that this information could provide initial candidates for the genes responsible for tuberous root expansion, and in particular for the syndrome of continuous cropping yield decline in this medicinally important species.
