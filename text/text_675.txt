BACKGROUND
early stages of drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis involve cellularization of the syncytial blastoderm and gastrulation. a series of morphogenetic events, which include cephalic and ventral furrow formation, posterior and anterior midgut invaginations, germ band extension and amnioserosa formation, initiate gastrulation and drive an extensive reorganization of the embryonic epithelium  <cit> . concurrent with these processes, the expression of zygotic transcripts is activated for the first time at the stage that precedes gastrulation, when degradation of the maternal transcripts has already started  <cit> . at later stages of embryogenesis, additional morphogenetic events, germ band retraction, dorsal closure and head involution, shape the first instar larva  <cit> . the precise control of these cell and tissue rearrangements requires the integration of diverse molecular processes. first, transcriptional regulators assign positional cues and cell fate, thus specifying different cellular groups. second, extracellular signals temporally and spatially coordinate the cellular behaviors that transform the embryo's epithelium. finally, changes in the cellular architecture are supported by the activity of cytoskeletal regulators and cytoskeletal binding proteins  <cit> . certain common molecular components, such as actin-myosin complexes, are part of the central mechanisms involved in early development in various organisms  <cit> . thus, the molecular components that regulate cell shape and movement seem to be ubiquitous, but morphogenetic changes take place only in specific clusters of cells. therefore, regulatory pathways should exist that differentially modulate cell behavior, leading to well-orchestrated cell shape changes and cell movements. in this regard, secreted and cell surface molecules, which are critical for intercellular communication, are expected to regulate many aspects of development.

genetic analysis of development in d. melanogaster has proven to be a powerful approach for studying the mechanisms of early embryogenesis, and most of the genes known to be involved in key developmental signaling pathways have been identified through classical genetic screens. genetic techniques have certain limitations, however, because genes with subtle loss-of-function phenotypes or pleiotropic roles are unlikely to be identified. furthermore, classical genetic screens do not focus on specific molecular classes . accordingly, other approaches have been developed that allow rapid and comprehensive identification of secreted and transmembrane gene products. these include library preparation from rna enriched by microsomal fractionation  <cit>  and rna-mediated interference  screens in a drosophila cell line  <cit> .

recent research has identified a host of genes that control diverse aspects of drosophila embryo development. cdna arrays have greatly accelerated the discovery of differentially expressed genes and opened up a broad spectrum of research possibilities. this technology has been applied, among others, to uncover neural precursor genes  <cit> , to determine temporal gene expression patterns for almost two-thirds of the d. melanogaster genome during its life cycle  <cit> , and to discover new genes involved in muscle differentiation  <cit>  and dorsoventral axis specification  <cit> .

as these studies collectively build a network of genetic interactions, it is necessary that we begin to identify comprehensive sets of genes active at the different developmental stages, in order to increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate morphogenesis throughout embryo development. with this goal in mind we applied a suppression subtractive hybridization  procedure to isolate genes that are expressed at the beginning of gastrulation. recording the temporal and spatial expression profiles of these genes will allow us to add critical details to the current models of cellular behavior during d. melanogaster morphogenesis.

in our current work we identified a small number of genes with temporally and spatially restricted patterns of expression in the d. melanogaster embryo. in particular, we recovered a subset of uncharacterized genes encoding putative secreted and transmembrane proteins, and for three of them we expressed their cdnas in d. melanogaster s2r+ cells and analyzed the subcellular localization of the recombinant proteins, confirming our sequence predictions. one of these genes, cg <dig>  with a restricted dorsal expression in the developing embryo, was then functionally tested by rnai. inhibition of cg <dig> resulted in morphogenetic defects reminiscent of those exhibited by already characterized genes with roles in amnioserosa maintenance and/or differentiation. our results contribute to the goal of finding all the genes involved in d. melanogaster embryogenesis by identifying a collection of genes that have not been previously implicated in development but have expression patterns suggestive of potential developmental roles.

RESULTS
subtracted cdna library composition and characterization
to isolate transcripts that are differentially expressed at early stages of drosophila development, we performed a ssh procedure between gastrulation and syncytial blastoderm stages, using cdna prepared from stage 6- <dig> embryos  as tester and that from stage 2- <dig> embryos  as driver, thus generating a cdna population enriched in cdna fragments that were expressed at a higher level in gastrula. as a control, ssh was also conducted reversely using the cdna prepared from stage 2- <dig> and stage 6- <dig> embryos as tester and driver, respectively. to evaluate the effectiveness of subtraction, we performed a set of experiments  showing that the actin transcript was indeed over-represented five-fold in unsubtracted samples compared with the subtracted samples for both forward and reverse reactions . thus, in our experimental conditions, subtractive hybridization removed common and housekeeping genes.

the pool of subtracted cdna fragments ranged from approximately  <dig> bp to approximately  <dig> kb, with most of the fragments  distributed between  <dig> and  <dig> bp. these fragments were inserted into a t/a cloning vector, and the resultant ssh library was used for sequence analysis. in addition, a subset of clones was randomly selected to determine the efficiency of subtraction using a manually spotted cdna microarray. the results indicated that  <dig> of  <dig>  cdna fragments tested displayed higher levels  of expression in gastrula compared with syncytial blastoderm . to provide further data on relative expression levels of the cloned cdnas,  <dig> positive clones were selected for virtual northern blot analysis; all cdnas were up-regulated in gastrula , thus validating the performance of the protocol.

of  <dig>  subtracted clones,  <dig> were randomly selected for sequencing. the sequences with poor quality or shorter than  <dig> bp were eliminated from further analyses. the sequences reported in this paper have been deposited in genbank: accession numbers ff579035-ff <dig>  by blast analysis against sequence databases available at flybase  <cit>  we identified  <dig> non-redundant cdnas that showed good matches  with sequences of the cds  database, indicating that they correspond to protein-coding genes. in addition, four non-coding rna , five transposition elements, and  <dig> sequences annotated as introns or as intergenic regions were identified. among the sequences that mapped to intergenic and intronic regions,  <dig> of them had matches  with d. melanogaster ests at the berkeley drosophila genome project, suggesting that they might represent true transcripts. in this regard, using the orestes methodology, maia et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> potentially transcribed regions derived from regions unannotated in the version  <dig>  of the d. melanogaster genome. experimental validation of unannotated orestes revealed  <dig> new exons of low-abundance transcripts. thus, some d. melanogaster genes or gene variants may still remain to be discovered.

regarding the  <dig> protein-coding genes isolated in this screen, we used the database of gene ontology  <cit> , together with domain searches performed against public databases, to proceed with the functional classification of this set of subtracted genes . the go annotations were contrasted with go annotation of the entire d. melanogaster genome, and we found that the relative counts of subtracted genes were different from that of the d. melanogaster genome in the second-level go categories . in the subtracted library the three major classes of go 'molecular functions' were: binding , transcription regulator activity , and catalytic activity . the first two were over-represented in the subtracted library when compared with the whole genome annotation, whereas catalytic activity was under-represented. for go 'biological processes' the most highly represented classes were cellular process , developmental process , and multicellular organismal process . the last two were over-represented in the library and, consistent with the developmental stage used as a tester during the subtraction procedure, these two classes include genes whose products are involved in morphogenesis, pattern specification, cellularization, and intracellular transport, among others.

temporal patterns of gene expression
to show how transcriptional activity of subtracted genes was modulated as a function of time during the first  <dig> stages of d. melanogaster development, we designed and used microarrays containing either the complete subtracted library  or  <dig> non-redundant cdnas  spotted onto nylon membranes. this approach has been previously used for gene expression profiling  <cit> . the data discussed in this work have been deposited in ncbi-gene expression omnibus  <cit> , under geo series accession no. gse <dig>  we selected embryos at successive intervals and prepared smart-cdnas to hybridize on microarrays. we attempted to obtain homogeneous populations of embryos at each developmental interval to increase the temporal resolution of the expression profiles. to that end, we hand-selected embryos according to morphological criteria  <cit>  at five intervals: stages 2- <dig>  syncytial blastoderms ; stage  <dig>  cellular blastoderm ; stages 6- <dig>  gastrula ; and postgastrulation stages . smart-cdna probes were evaluated for their temporal specificity using quantitative real-time pcr  to amplify the transcripts of stage-specific genes . after microarray hybridizations, the data files generated from the microarray images were processed to remove low-quality spots and normalized as described in methods. the results of this analysis showed that  <dig> genes  and five non-coding sequences were differentially expressed  <5%) between any developmental interval and the reference interval  as determined by significance analysis of microarrays  <cit> . all of these genes were up-regulated at least at one of the examined intervals . most of the remaining cdnas corresponded to spots of low-intensity signal, suggesting that microarray hybridization failed to reach the sensitivity of the ssh procedure to detect low-abundance transcripts. in this regard, it has been shown that the sensitivity of microarray analysis is determined by the targets used to hybridize the membranes but not by the probes printed on them  <cit> .

signal intensity data resulting from genes that were differentially expressed in the microarray experiments were used to generate scatter plots, representing the ratio for each gene between a given developmental interval  and the reference s2- <dig> . relative to s2- <dig>  the highest frequency of up-regulated genes was observed at s <dig> and 6- <dig>  and by s10- <dig> a major fraction of genes exhibited similar expression levels with s2- <dig> . thus, the temporal expression levels of genes isolated in our screen indicate that their expression patterns change throughout the developmental intervals and that these shifts differed from gene to gene.

we compared the genes that were identified as up-regulated in this study with available data from reports on global gene expression analyses during d. melanogaster development . despite the differences in the procedure to obtain the cdnas and in the hybridization techniques, we found that 27% of the up-regulated genes  reported here were described as transiently expressed during early embryogenesis, as described  <cit> , including genes previously characterized  and unidentified genes . moreover, 17% of the genes that changed their expression levels during early stages of development belong to the group of early zygotic genes  <cit> , whereas  <dig> % of them  correspond to genes that were classified as specifically expressed during cellularization  <cit> . finally, we found that 12% of the genes recovered from our microarray hybridization have been described as genes differentially expressed between gastrula and syncytial blastoderm stages  <cit> .

when we analyzed the genes that significantly increased their expression levels in least at one interval compared with the s2- <dig>  we distinguished the following classes:  <dig> genes have a phenotype or molecular function reported in the literature and have a name assigned; the remaining  <dig> genes either lack a name but have an assigned cg number, or have a name but are not functionally characterized. for  <dig> genes of these two last classes a go term has been assigned on the basis of homology with known protein domains or genes in other species, whereas the remaining  <dig> genes are essentially uncharacterized. for some of them we were able to predict signal peptide sequences and/or transmembrane regions .

using data derived from the  <dig> protein-coding genes and four ncrna genes, a clustering analysis was performed to group genes with similar expression profiles over the five developmental intervals . the analysis revealed three distinct patterns of gene expression along the developmental stages examined. the first group  contains genes that show maximal activity at s6- <dig> and a rapid decrease in gene expression at later stages, indicating that our approach yielded a cdna population enriched in transcripts corresponding to genes expressed during gastrulation. as an example, we analyzed gene composition in this cluster and found transcripts encoding proteins known to play roles during gastrulation, such as the transcriptional regulator brk, which is expressed in the neurogenic ectoderm and restricts the expression of decapentaplegic  target genes to the dorsal ectoderm  <cit> , tup, a target of dpp and member of the ush-group of genes required for amnioserosa maintenance  <cit> , and trn, a transmembrane protein containing extracellular leucine-rich repeats  <cit> . the second and third groups  contain genes that showed a pattern of successive increase and decrease in gene expression, with peaks of expression at s <dig> and s8- <dig>  in the second group , several of the genes showed a rapid decrease in expression at s10- <dig>  whereas most of genes in group  <dig>  remained active at those late stages of embryogenesis.

the majority of the genes detected as up-regulated in our microarray analysis  are contained within these two groups . they show peak expression during embryo cellularization, a transcriptional profile that seems consistent with the evidence that zygotic transcription starts at the beginning of cellular blastoderm formation  <cit>  and with large-scale transcriptome analyses during d. melanogaster embryogenesis  <cit> . among the genes with peak expression in s <dig>  we recovered the sry-α gene, which encodes a protein essential for membrane invagination that is specifically required during cellularization  <cit> . other genes showed more sustained expression at later stages of embryogenesis, for example: a) developmentally regulated transcription factors  with known expression patterns and roles in early embryonic development  <cit> ; b) transmembrane proteins, such as ptc, the receptor of the morphogen hedgehog  <cit>  and nrt, a cell adhesion molecule that initiates its expression during cellularization, and later on is restricted to neuronal precursors  <cit> ; and c) components of intracellular signaling pathways, such as stumps  that functions downstream of the fibroblast growth factor receptor during mesoderm migration and tracheal branching  <cit> , and vn, a ligand of the epidermal growth factor receptor that participates in the patterning of the neuroectoderm during gastrulation  <cit> .

on other hand,  <dig> genes  have not been experimentally characterized in d. melanogaster; however, several of them encode products having sequence similarity to known proteins or containing conserved domains . among the genes encoding products with conserved domains, we found patched-related , a transmembrane protein containing a sterol-sensing domain. we recently cloned the full-length cdna of ptr and compared the amino acid sequence identity of the encoded protein among sterol-sensing domain-containing proteins from different species of insects and vertebrates, finding that ptr belongs to a divergent, previously uncharacterized class of insect transmembrane protein. we also have demonstrated that ptr expression is developmentally regulated, being preferentially expressed in early embryo stages  <cit> .

to validate the gene expression profiles, qpcr analyses were performed for four genes  at selected developmental stages, using independently isolated batches of total rna extracted from staged embryos. even though the quantities of transcripts detected could not be compared because of the different methods of estimation, the patterns of expression obtained via qpcr closely paralleled the microarray data .

spatial distribution of genes
to illustrate the spatial pattern of expression of genes differentially expressed in our microarray analysis,  <dig> genes were selected for in situ hybridization assays. five of them corresponded to genes previously characterized  with known patterns of expression, whereas the other  <dig> were selected among uncharacterized genes . as  <dig> of  <dig> uncharacterized genes recovered from our microarray analysis encoded putative secreted or transmembrane proteins, we selected  <dig> of them to examine whether they displayed restricted patterns of expression in the developing embryo that might imply potential developmental roles. we chose to characterize genes encoding putative secreted or transmembrane proteins because they are expected to be active and play an important role in the temporal and spatial coordination of early d. melanogaster embryogenesis. in fact, secreted and membrane proteins have been reported to play a critical roles in d. melanogaster embryogenesis, as indicated by the functional characterization of genes involved in the hedgehog  <cit> , dpp  <cit> , and wingless  <cit>  signaling pathways, among others. additional genes examined by in situ hybridization encoded products with conserved protein domains, such as dh-ph, metalloprotease, acetyltransferase, sh <dig>  and phosphatase, and one mrna-like ncrna .

expression patterns obtained after in situ hybridization analysis were categorized as 'ubiquitous' , if similar levels of expression were observed in all tissues, and as 'restricted' , if transcripts were localized to just a few regions of the embryo in at least one of the stages examined. the expression patterns of all the restricted genes  and one ubiquitous gene are illustrated in figure 4; they correspond to  <dig> previously unidentified and five characterized genes: ci , ventrally expressed protein-d , esp  trn  and atx- <dig> . in figure  <dig>  in situ images were ordered according to developmental time to allow visual correlation between microarray profiles and gene expression as revealed by the in situ assays. we categorized the expression changes  and represented each category with a color bar, using s2- <dig>  with the lowest expression value , as a reference. as expected, undetectable or very weak expression was observed for the entire set of genes at s2- <dig> . the five characterized genes reproduce the expression patterns described in the literature and showed good correlation between microarray and in situ image data . in the case of uncharacterized genes with restricted patterns of expression, we found that in situ images of gene expression were consistent with the microarray results . for gene cg <dig>  however, we could not correlate microarray data with in situ images of its expression at s8- <dig> . if the expression level of cg <dig> is low and it is expressed only in a subset of cells, as is shown in the in situ image, it is possible that the microarray results from the whole-animal experiment may not have been sensitive enough to detect gene expression changes, resulting in a disparity with the microarray expression profile. for seven of the uncharacterized genes the expression patterns described here confirmed the in situ data available at bdgp gene expression database  <cit> .

a significant fraction of the uncharacterized genes included in this assay exhibited spatially restricted patterns of expression during embryogenesis, including  <dig> of the  <dig> genes that encode putative secreted or transmembrane proteins, suggesting that they might play roles in development. in the cellular blastoderm and gastrula stages, several transcripts were asymmetrically distributed along the dorsoventral  or anteroposterior  axes. other transcripts showed a more uniform distribution at the cellular blastoderm stage; some of them refined their expression pattern during gastrulation  or after germ band extension , one of them became undetectable at later stages of embryogenesis , and one remained ubiquitous .

two genes  showed highly restricted distributions at the cellular blastoderm stage and a similar pattern of expression along the developmental stages examined , suggesting a shared gene regulation and/or functional relationship. their transcripts were first detected at s <dig> in the dorsal-most cells of the embryo, and this expression pattern persisted during gastrulation to become enriched in the cells of the amnioserosa at later stages of embryogenesis . thus, the expression pattern of cg <dig> and cr <dig> suggests that these genes might be involved in the early events of amnioserosa formation. consistent with the asymmetrical distribution of cg <dig> transcripts along the dorsoventral axis, cg <dig> seems to be an ectodermic transcriptional target of the dorsal morphogen  <cit> . this gene encodes a protein that lacks any conserved domains or significant sequence similarity in the databases, thus precluding making inferences about its function or interaction with other proteins. however, the cg <dig> deduced amino acid sequence includes a predicted signal peptide at its amino terminus and a predicted transmembrane domain, suggesting that it is associated with membranes  <cit> . cr <dig>  on the other hand, is an uncharacterized putative mrna-like ncrna encoding several short open reading frames. in this regard, in situ hybridization analyses of  <dig> mrna-like ncrnas, whose transcripts are expressed during embryogenesis, revealed that  <dig> of them were detected in specific embryonic tissues  <cit> . thus, restrictive spatial expression patterns might be a common feature of mrna-like ncrnas. moreover, these highly regulated expression patterns suggest that many mrna-like ncrnas might play important roles in d. melanogaster embryogenesis, as previously demonstrated  <cit> .

an additional gene that showed restricted patterns of expression at the cellular blastoderm stage encodes a member of the sulfate transporter family . interestingly, another gene encoding a sulfate transporter  was also recovered from our microarray analysis; both of them are homologs of the human diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter . mutations in dtdst result in reduced sulfate transport, which in turn leads to defects in glycosaminoglycan  synthesis, under-sulfation of proteoglycans, and abnormal cartilage formation. to our knowledge, sulfate transporters have not been characterized in d. melanogaster; the temporal and spatial regulation of these two genes, however, suggests that they might play a role in gag synthesis early during embryogenesis. in this respect, an analysis of d. melanogaster mutants with defects in sulfotransferases revealed the significance of sulfation of gags on growth factor signaling during development; for example, a mutation in the gene sfl causes defects in wingless  <cit>  and fibroblast growth factor signaling  <cit> .

another gene that seems to be a good candidate to play roles during embryogenesis is rhogef <dig> , which encodes a putative member of guanine nucleotide exchange factor  family of proteins  <cit> . the expression pattern of rhogef <dig> differs from that of the known d. melanogaster gefs, because they are usually post-translationally regulated and maternally supplied, and their spatial distributions are ubiquitous during early development  <cit> . thus, the restricted expression pattern of rhogef <dig>  makes it one of the first examples of a gef-encoding gene that is regulated at the transcriptional level during d. melanogaster development, suggesting that it might be required for the spatial and temporal control of actin dynamics. five genes that showed restricted patterns of expression at the cellular blastoderm stage encoded putative secreted or transmembrane proteins; four of them, cg <dig> , cg <dig> , cg <dig>  and cg <dig>  in figure  <dig>  lack any other conserved domain, whereas cg <dig>  seems to encode a putative secreted metalloprotease that showed restricted expression in the procephalic embryo region, making it a good candidate for targeted functional studies.

among the transcripts that had restricted localization after the cellular blastoderm stage, we found cg <dig> , encoding a putative scavenger receptor  <cit> , and two genes cg <dig> and cg <dig> , encoding putative secreted proteins. cg <dig> and cg <dig> were recently identified  <cit>  as genes transiently expressed during embryo development. as the temporal expression pattern of cg <dig> and cg <dig> correlated well with the expression of several members of the notch pathway, including notch itself, the authors examined whether these two genes colocalized with the notch pathway by using delta as a marker. the results of their spatial colocalization allowed them to suggest that cg <dig> and cg <dig> are implicated in notch-regulated developmental processes. finally, the potential roles of genes cg <dig> , cg <dig>  and cg <dig>  were more elusive; they encode putative secreted or transmembrane proteins, but no further inferences about their biochemical activities could be made from their protein sequence. nevertheless, their temporal expression patterns during d. melanogaster embryogenesis have been consistently reported by others  <cit> .

taken together, our analysis of gene expression during d. melanogaster embryogenesis not only confirmed a number of known expression patterns but also revealed several developmentally restricted uncharacterized genes with common temporal expression patterns that should be the target of functional studies and become integrated into the developmental networks that are active during early embryogenesis in d. melanogaster. thus, our results complement previous high-throughput screens in d. melanogaster embryos  <cit> , which revealed that a significant fraction of uncharacterized transcripts exhibited spatially restricted patterns of expression in the developing embryo, suggesting that they play distinct roles during embryogenesis.

characterization of new genes encoding putative secreted and transmembrane proteins
we attempted to further characterize four of the uncharacterized genes identified in our screen that encode putative secreted and transmembrane proteins, cg <dig>  cg <dig>  cg <dig> and cg <dig>  to confirm that these proteins are secreted or associated with membranes we transiently transfected drosophila s2r+ cells with plasmid constructs encoding the cdna of each protein fused to a v <dig> tag or a myc tag sequence under the control of an inducible metallothionein promoter. after induction with cuso <dig>  we recovered the culture medium in which transfected cells had grown and cells were disrupted and centrifuged  to obtain post-nuclear supernatants and corresponding pellets. cell fractions and culture medium were examined by western blotting. as controls for the expected distributions for secreted, cytoplasmic, and transmembrane proteins, we performed parallel transfections with vectors expressing the signal sequence of drosophila bip protein appended to green fluorescent protein  and to v <dig> tag , the cytoplasmic protein β-galactosidase fused to v <dig> tag , and the drosophila transmembrane protein ptr fused to v <dig> . as shown in figure 5a, cg <dig>  cg <dig> and cg <dig> fusion proteins were predominantly detected in the culture medium , confirming that they are secreted proteins. in the case of cg <dig>  the fusion protein was detected exclusively in the pellet fraction, indicating that it is associated with particulate components of cells, including cellular membranes . no fusion protein was found in the supernatant fraction , except for the β-galactosidase control that lacks a signal peptide and transmembrane domain. these results confirm our prediction of four putative secreted or transmembrane proteins encoded by previously uncharacterized d. melanogaster genes.

the subcellular localization of the fusion proteins was examined by double immunofluorescence experiments using an antibody that recognizes the protein tags and alexa 546-phalloidin to label actin filaments . controls of uninduced cells showed no reactivity with anti-v <dig> or anti-myc . these experiments showed that transfected s2r+ cells stained positively for cg <dig>  cg <dig>  cg <dig> and cg <dig> fusion proteins in vesicle-like structures . in addition, a fine granular fluorescence was observed all over the surface of cells expressing cg6234-v <dig>  consistent with the detection of the tagged protein in the plasma membrane fraction. thus, subcellular localization along with the restricted temporal and spatial patterns of expression that these genes displayed during d. melanogaster embryogenesis make them good candidates for functional studies.

as a first step towards functional analysis, we selected gene cg <dig> for further study, using heritable rnai technology to reduce its expression. we chose this experimental approach because no cg <dig> mutant or suitable p-element insertion  exists. thus, we generated a transgenic line that expresses an inverted repeat of a 560-bp region of the cg <dig> coding sequence under the control of the uas promoter in the vector pwiz . the transgenic flies were crossed with flies carrying the nanos-gal <dig> driver to activate transcription of the hairpin-encoding transgene in the progeny. as a control, uas-cg6234ir and gal <dig> drivers were crossed with w <dig> flies. we examined by qpcr the cg <dig> transcription level in f <dig> embryos and found that the amount of cg <dig> mrna in nanos-gal4/uas-cg6234ir embryos was  <dig> to 35% of the control embryos .

as cg <dig> is mainly expressed in the primordial and developing amnioserosa, we used the amnioserosa marker hindsight   <cit>  to examine the phenotype of embryos expressing uas-cg6234ir. f <dig> embryos showed a reduced number of hnt-positive nuclei in the amnioserosa , suggesting the loss of amnioserosa cells. two morphogenetic processes are known to require proper amnioserosa integrity: these are germ band retraction, which transforms the u-shaped germ band of the embryo by bringing its tail end to the final posterior position, and dorsal closure, a process that follows germ band retraction and seals the epidermis along the dorsal midline . consistent with a loss of amnioserosa integrity, embryos expressing uas-cg6234ir displayed morphological defects; of note, the process of germ band retraction was severely disrupted . in addition, the embryos showed head defects, suggesting a failure to undergo head involution , a developmental process that leads to internalization of anterior ectodermal tissue and that seems to share genetic components with dorsal closure . thus, our results indicate that inducible down-regulation of cg <dig> expression affects major morphogenetic events during embryo development. moreover, the phenotype of uas-cg6234ir is shared with previously described genes, among them genes that control amnioserosa cell death, such as hnt, tup, ush, srp and doc  <cit> . these genes are predominantly expressed in the amnioserosa, and when mutated they disrupt germ band retraction and in some cases they also affect head involution. in the case of cg <dig>  further functional studies will be necessary to place it within the known pathways that regulate these morphogenetic events.

CONCLUSIONS
to understand the dynamics of the gene networks that underlie morphogenetic events of d. melanogaster embryogenesis, it is necessary to identify and characterize genes that are active at different developmental stages. the screen we described here allowed us to isolate genes differentially expressed between the gastrula and syncytial blastoderm stages. microarrays were constructed to analyze the temporal expression patterns of subtracted genes during five developmental intervals that covered  <dig> stages of d. melanogaster embryogenesis. the results indicate that the expression of  <dig> genes, including  <dig> functionally unknown genes, increased significantly at least at one developmental interval compared with reference stages . the large number of functionally uncharacterized genes  identified as up-regulated during the developmental stages examined indicate that the ssh procedure together with the precise selection of staged embryos may be useful in providing information on uncharacterized genes having potential function at specific developmental stages.

in the same context, our results on the spatial distribution of  <dig> up-regulated genes indicate that a significant fraction of them  exhibited restricted expression patterns during embryonic development. their transcripts were detected in a variety of temporal and spatial expression domains, suggesting distinct roles during embryogenesis and making them good candidates for functional analyses. in addition, protein sequence analysis and motif identification revealed a set of uncharacterized gene products with putative functions as secreted or transmembrane proteins. for some of them, we validated our sequence predictions by analyzing their subcellular localization, thus providing new insights into effector molecules that might function in intercellular communication during d. melanogaster embryogenesis.

using rnai, we explored the function of one uncharacterized gene, cg <dig>  which showed a dorsally restricted expression pattern during embryo development. phenotypic alterations of embryos expressing cg6234-rnai support the idea that cg <dig> might play a role in embryo morphogenesis. the cg <dig> rnai phenotype was reminiscent of that exhibited by previously characterized genes that function in amnioserosa maintenance and/or differentiation. interestingly, they shared similar temporal and spatial expression patterns with cg <dig>  suggesting a common mechanism of transcriptional regulation. thus our results provide information on new components of signaling pathways that might be incorporated within the known networks regulating d. melanogaster embryogenesis.

finally, we note that even though d. melanogaster embryogenesis may appear to be a special case of morphogenesis, the cellular phenomena and the molecules involved are clearly general. moreover, comparison of gene expression patterns and gene functions at key points during development reveals several molecular pathways that are common to bilaterian embryos. as d. melanogaster is the model organism that has provided much of our knowledge of embryogenesis and developmental genetics, it is relevant to understand more deeply the molecular processes underlying morphogenetic events in this organism and to discover and characterize the effector molecules that make effective cell-shape changes and promote cell migration.
