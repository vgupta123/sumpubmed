BACKGROUND
fungi, whether they are saprophytes or pathogens, are able to detect and adapt to a wide range of environmental ph values. the ability of fungal cells to maintain homeostasis is exemplified in their capacity to grow in both acid and alkaline ph conditions. furthermore, ph levels often serve as crucial external cues, providing information about the local environment. it is known that fungi respond to ambient ph levels via activation of a dedicated transcription factor, pacc  <cit> . this response is initiated by a signaling cascade which begins with a cell surface sensor, palh, a protein with seven transmembrane helices. palh probes the extracellular ph level. palf, an arrestin-like protein which interacts with palh, is ubiquitinated in response to alkaline ph  <cit> . the cascade leads to the activation of pacc by proteolytic cleavage and, finally, to transcriptional regulation  <cit> .

fungal pathogens of animals and plants need to sense and respond to local ph. in addition, several fungal pathogens of plants were shown to raise or lower the local ph during the establishment of the disease. it is also known that ph signals program gene expression in the pathogen  <cit> . for instance, colletotrichum gloeosporioides attacks unripe avocado fruits, but these remain resistant to the fungus until the fruits ripen. during the ripening process, the ph of the avocado pericarp increases from ph  <dig>  to ph  <dig> , and following this increase in ph, the decay symptoms become evident. furthermore, the pathogen itself contributes to alkalinization. thus, the host ph can affect the progress of disease via the production of virulence factors  <cit> . there are several other examples which indicate the importance and relevance of pacc to this process: first, the pacc ortholog of colletotrichum acutatum is essential for virulence on citrus, at the penetration stage  <cit> . second, in the vascular wilt pathogen fusarium oxysporum, constitutive-active pacc strains were found to be less virulent than wild type strains on the tomato host  <cit> . in contrast, pacc null mutants of the foliar pathogen sclerotinia sclerotiorum were less virulent than wild type on arabidopsis and tomato  <cit> . this contrasting regulation suggests that in different species, pacc may play different roles in determining virulence. another interesting example is candida albicans, a commensal that can become pathogenic in susceptible hosts. this organism colonizes the oral-pharyngeal, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts as a commensal. following this colonization, c. albicans can become a pathogen, infecting these tissues. it may then enter the bloodstream and disseminate to almost any tissue in the body. the c. albicans sites of action are characterised by a diversity in ph levels, e.g., acidic ph levels in the gastrointestinal and vaginal tracts, and neutral-to-alkaline levels in the oral-pharyngeal tract and in the bloodstream. thus, a successful response to extracellular ph is critical for virulence  <cit> . trichophyton rubrum, a dermatophyte, responds to the ph level of human skin by expressing enzymes that have acid ph optima  <cit> . pacc has been shown to serve as a virulence factor for aspergillus nidulans in a mouse model: null mutants showed reduced virulence, while a constitutively active pacc allele conferred hypervirulence  <cit> . the insect pathogen metarhizium anisopliae uses ph as a signal to produce specific enzymes whose ph optima correspond to the ambient ph levels  <cit> . a wide variety of genes and activities are controlled by pacc, including xylanases  <cit> , permeases  <cit> , siderophores  <cit> , antibiotic and toxin production  <cit> , and involvement in pathogenic processes  <cit> .

fungi can also attack other fungi . prominent examples of this are found among soil fungi of the genus trichoderma, which are being applied worldwide as biocontrol agents against soil-borne and foliar plant diseases  <cit> . the biocontrol fungus antagonizes host fungi in a variety of ways: mycoparasitism, antibiotic production, induction of systemic resistance in the plant, competition for nutrients and space, modification of the local environment, and degradation of pathogen germination stimulants which are released by seeds. trichoderma also increases the plant’s tolerance to stress by promoting growth and vigor  <cit> . moreno-mateos et al. <cit>  have shown that several trichoderma harzianum genes which are thought to be involved in the antagonism of host fungi  are regulated by ph. in t. harzianum, pacc promotes the expression of chitinase and qid <dig>  and represses protease and glucose permease. pacc also negatively regulates the production of inhibitory metabolites. contrary to what might have been expected in view of the increased production of inhibitors, however, mycoparasitism is decreased in the null mutant  <cit> . in several trichoderma species, conidiation depends on ph; the mode of regulation varies from one species or isolate to another  <cit> . conidiation has previously been correlated with intracellular acidification  <cit> , providing an explanation as to why the ph must be low in order for conidiation to occur on buffered media  <cit> . in this study, we examined an isolate of trichoderma virens which is an aggressive mycoparasite on the sclerotia of s. rolfsii and on the hyphae and sclerotia of rhizoctonia solani <cit> . the genome sequence of this species has recently been made available  <cit> , thus allowing a first complete analysis of ph- and pacc-regulation in a mycotroph at the level of the transcriptome.

RESULTS
construction of loss- and gain-of-function mutants in the ph-sensitive regulator pacc
t. virens pacc gene
having initiated this study before the t. virens genome project, we used sequences from other filamentous ascomycetes to identify a t. virens ortholog of pacc. degenerate primers for nested amplification  were designed from the amino acid sequences of the regions most conserved in several pacc orthologs . a product of ~400 bp was obtained and cloned, and four additional primers were designed for pcr-based genome walking. we obtained a genomic clone including ~2 kb of upstream and downstream sequences, sufficient for the design of gene replacement constructs. the gene contains a 2094 bp orf with three predicted introns. the predicted protein product has a molecular mass of 67 kda and contains  <dig> amino acid residues. when this sequence was compared to genbank-deposited sequences from several organisms, the best blast similarity scores were obtained with the pacc proteins of the ascomycete fungi fusarium oxysporum, acremonium chrysogenum and gibberella moniliformis . like trichoderma virens, all of these species belong to the class sordariomycetes. the consensus binding site for pacc identified from aspergillus nidulans <cit> , gccarg, is found  <dig> times within the 1 kb upstream of the predicted translation start of t. virens pacc. the strong, ph-independent expression of the truncated, active, paccc allele that we constructed suggests that pacc indeed regulates the expression of the gene that encodes it . the sequence of the t. virens imi  <dig> pacc gene  exhibits  <dig> snps relative to the corresponding gene model in t. virens gv <dig>  . these snps result in six predicted differences in protein sequence, four encoding amino acids with strongly similar properties to those of the sequence predicted from the reference genome, and two with weakly similar properties . thus, there are variations between two trichoderma virens isolates in the amino acid sequence encoded by this well-conserved gene. it is unclear whether these snps have any functional significance.

pacc deletion mutants
to determine the function of pacc, deletion mutants  were obtained by homologous integration resulting from double-crossover integration events. to this end, t. virens protoplasts were transformed with linearized plasmid dna, using the polyethylene glycol-ca++ method. of about  <dig> transformants screened by pcr amplification with primers specific for homologous integration, we obtained two, Δpacc <dig> and Δpacc <dig>  in which the pacc gene was replaced by the hygromycin resistance cassette. transformants were purified by single-spore isolation, and homologous recombination was confirmed by pcr. the primer pairs, expected sizes, and pcr products obtained are provided in additional file  <dig> 

construction of constitutively active pacc mutants
constitutively active mutants , are expected to bypass the need for the ambient ph signal, resulting in a phenotype that mimics growth under alkaline conditions  <cit> . based on the known characterization of the proteolytic cascade activating a. nidulans pacc, we predicted that the truncation allele in t. virens that we designed , would lead to a gain-of-function behavior, i.e. as a bona fide paccc allele. indeed, transcriptional data, including data on the pacc gene itself, provide strong support for this assumption. to this end, we constructed a paccc line using the split-marker method . to construct the paccc allele we designed a construct in which the c-terminal part of pacc  was replaced by the hygromycin resistance cassette. the construct also included flanking regions upstream and downstream of the gene, of ~ <dig>  kb each, to allow for double-crossover recombination. the transformants were isolated, purified, and confirmed by pcr amplification .

comparison of loss and gain-of function mutants to wt
during the first 24 h after inoculation, Δpacc and wild-type strains exhibited nearly identical growth rates when inoculated on standard pda  plates. after this initial time period the mutant displayed a slower growth rate than the wt strain, so that 48 h after the inoculation this resulted in a ~20% reduction of colony diameters of the Δpacc mutant colonies grown in the light, and ~18% for diameters of colonies grown in the dark, when compared to wt colonies . in addition, differences were apparent in the morphology of the colony surface. colonies of the Δpacc mutants conidiated less in the light ; in the dark, wild type colony surfaces were convex, whereas mutant colonies were flat. wild type, paccc and Δpacc strains were then assayed for their ability to grow on pda media buffered to different ph values  . the most striking phenotype of Δpacc was observed at alkaline ph: there was a dramatic reduction in growth when the initial ph of the plates was  <dig> or higher . for the paccc strain no such effect was evident, and its growth rate at alkaline ph was only slightly reduced in comparison to the wt . confrontation assays are often used as a measure of the ability of trichoderma to compete with, to antagonize, and to overgrow a fungal host. we thus tested the wt, Δpacc and paccc strains for their ability to overgrow and parasitize two plant pathogens, rhizoctonia solani and sclerotium rolfsii. Δpacc overgrew rhizoctonia solani more slowly than did the wt . the interaction with sclerotium rolfsii was more complex, with some hyphae of this pathogen initially overgrowing wt trichoderma after the two colonies met, but with a complete prevalence of wt over s. rolfsii, and a covering of the sclerotia formed in the oldest region of the s. rolfsii colony, later on. Δpacc initially followed the same pattern as wt, eventually overgrowing s. rolfsii, yet was unable to cover the sclerotia. as seen in figure  <dig>  sporulation of wt , but not sporulation of Δpacc , was visible on the sclerotia. the ambient ph was similar in interactions with wt or with Δpacc . at alkaline ph, paccc showed wild type virulence in confrontation with rhizoctonia solani, despite its slightly reduced growth rate. at acidic ph, the growth rate of paccc was markedly reduced compared to wt . perhaps due to this slower growth, paccc was ineffective in confrontation assays against s. rolfsii . both wt and paccc colony growth resulted in an alkalinization of the pda medium, as has been observed previously for several trichoderma species, when secondary nitrogen is available  <cit> . in comparison with the wt, the increase in ph was less extensive for Δpacc . microscopic examination of the samples revealed mycoparasitic coiling in interactions of all three strains - wt, Δpacc, and paccc - with rhizoctonia solani. furthermore, no morphological alterations or difference in the extent of coiling were evident when the three strains were compared .

genome-wide study of pacc function
the phenotypes of the loss- and gain-of-function mutants in pacc that were studied here point to central roles for pacc in mycoparasitism. the pacc and ph-dependent transcriptomes provide insights into a variety of processes controlled by ph signaling, and into the mechanisms underlying ph homeostasis. to date, the transcriptomic consequences of ph signaling have only been studied in a relatively small number of fungal species  <cit> . the diversity of signal processing among fungal species suggests that a conserved regulatory factor can have different targets in different biological models. thus, we reasoned that the trichoderma virens transcriptome could provide insights into the role of ph signaling in fungal-fungal interactions. to this end, t. virens cultures were exposed to a one-hour alkaline or acidic ph step by transferring them to medium titrated to ph  <dig>  or ph  <dig> , and subsequently harvested.

prior to performing microarray analysis, we chose  <dig> genes whose expression was previously reported to be regulated by ph in other fungi, and identified their orthologs in t. virens . expression of these genes in wt and Δpacc was compared following exposure to the alkaline and acidic ph steps . the results we obtained for six of these genes are shown in figure  <dig>  as expected, pacc transcripts were not detected in the deletion mutant because the entire coding sequence was deleted . in accordance with what has been reported for other fungi, we found that in the wt, exposure to alkaline ph resulted in an upregulation of pacc transcript levels. of the genes listed in table  <dig>  the only one, other than pacc, to exhibit pacc-dependent expression was a p-atpase gene, id  <dig>  pacc-dependent expression was reported previously for the fusarium oxysporum ortholog of this gene, ena <dig> <cit> . we note that “protein id” numbers are used throughout this report to designate both the gene and the predicted protein, because these identifiers conveniently lead to the complete information in the t. virens genome website . two genes were found to be upregulated by alkaline ph, but not via pacc: these were id  <dig>  and id  <dig> . acid phosphatase is a known acid-expressed gene in aspergillus nidulans <cit> . it is intriguing, therefore, that this gene was found here to be upregulated by the alkaline ph shift . we found that two iron uptake-related genes: sida  and a predicted siderophore transporter were upregulated by the ph  <dig> step. since fe solubility decreases with increasing ph, it is possible that increased expression of siderophore biosynthesis-related genes may reflect an adaptation to limited iron availability. the other genes we examined  did not show any significant dependence on ph. this is consistent with the existence of variations in ph and other signaling networks between different species . the results in figure  <dig> show the similarity in the ph-regulation of t. virens pacc expression to that of its well-studied aspergillus nidulans ortholog. in summary, these data demonstrated that the ph step signal was transduced to changes in gene expression, and we thus proceeded to a full-scale transcriptomic analysis.

candidate genes whose expression might depend on ph and/or pacc were chosen from published studies in aspergillus nidulans <cit> , fusarium oxysporum <cit>  and t. harzianum <cit> . a t. virens p-type atpase  was already available from a differential library for transcripts expressed preferentially in cultures grown on autoclaved r. solani material. protein id numbers refer to the t. virens v <dig>  sequence. e values  are from blastp searches of the t. virens genome with the corresponding genes indicated in the next column .

microarray analysis
oligonucleotide microarrays were hybridized with probes synthesized from rna samples from the ph  <dig> and ph  <dig> treatments. plotting the signals from wt or Δpacc at ph  <dig> against those at ph  <dig>  revealed that most of the signals were distributed within ±  <dig> standard deviation limits around the trendline. treatment-dependent genes found below or above the trendlines deviate from what would be expected from random fluctuations in the transcript levels. thus, this graphic analysis of the data shows that a large number of genes were regulated by the ph step treatments. a complete statistical analysis of the transcriptional profiles with limma using a cutoff of >2-fold change and a p-value of p <  <dig>  revealed that in the wt, more than  <dig> genes were differentially regulated in response to ph. the significantly regulated classes defined by limma analyses are depicted in figure  <dig>  of these ph-dependent genes,  <dig> were differentially expressed after exposure to the alkaline ph step in wt relative to Δpacc . the  <dig> genes regulated by ph comprise ~about 5% of the  <dig>  predicted protein-encoding transcripts, indicating that t. virens has a far-reaching transcriptomic response to external ph. pacc is responsible, either partially or entirely, for the ph regulation of 1% of all protein-encoding genes. this large number makes pacc a global transcriptional regulator in t. virens. nrg <dig> and smp <dig>  negative regulators which transduce the signal downstream of rim101/pacc in yeast  <cit> , were not found in the set of downregulated genes in our analysis.

validation of microarray results by qpcr
two qpcr data sets were used for validation of the microarray data. the first set has been described above . in figure  <dig>  data of qpcr amplifications from the same three independent rna samples that we used to generate the probes for microarray analysis are presented. for the second qpcr data set, we performed an additional biological repeat under identical conditions, and the constitutively-active paccc mutant was also included . we then checked the expression of  <dig> candidate pacc-dependent genes  using qpcr. the results are shown in figure  <dig>  in general, we found the regulation patterns determined by qpcr agreed well with the microarray hybridization data. as shown in figure  <dig>  the expression pattern of the panel of genes tested in the constitutively-active paccc strain  was largely similar to that of the wt at ph  <dig>  the expression level of most of these genes, however, was higher in paccc than in the wt. this suggests that activation of pacc in the wt does not reach saturation levels under ambient alkaline conditions, and that further activation is possible, and might occur in nature at unusually high ph values. alternatively, since the constitutively active allele is present throughout growth whereas in wt the activation of pacc occurs only during the ph step, the response in the latter might then  be integrated over a relatively short time.

following microarray analyses, genes were chosen based on fold change and relevance. protein id numbers refer to the t. virens v <dig>  database.

classification of regulated transcripts
enrichment in kog classes was measured by comparing the expected number of genes representing each kog class with the observed numbers. when we compared the genes that were upregulated in the wt at ph  <dig> as compared to ph  <dig> , we found that there was a clear enrichment in the expression of genes involved in carbohydrate and inorganic ion transport, metabolism, and “deficiency” in classes related to transcription, replication, translation, and cell cycle control. comparison of genes that were downregulated in wt at ph  <dig> vs. wt at ph  <dig>  showed that there was an enrichment in genes involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport and catabolism; energy production and conversion; carbohydrate transport and metabolism. in addition, we found there were fewer genes than expected belonging to the following groups: transcription; translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis; replication, recombination and repair; intracellular trafficking, secretion and vesicular transport; rna processing and modification. pacc upregulated genes should meet two criteria: those whose expression is significantly greater in wt ph  <dig> vs. wt ph  <dig>  and also significantly greater in wt ph  <dig> vs. Δpacc ph  <dig>  this set showed enrichment in carbohydrate and inorganic ion transport and metabolism . conversely, pacc downregulated genes are those whose expression is significantly lower in wt ph  <dig> vs. wt ph  <dig>  and in wt ph  <dig> vs. Δpacc ph  <dig>  this set showed enrichment in secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport and catabolism, and in nucleotide transport and metabolism .

secondary metabolite biosynthesis is finely tuned, and there is previous evidence for its regulation by ambient ph  <cit> . one of the proteins included in the pacc-dependent, down-regulated secondary metabolite-related gene class is a non-ribosomal peptide synthase, protein id  <dig>  the gene coding for this protein, named tex <dig> <cit> , is related to chnps <dig> of cochliobolus heterostrophus, which has a role in conidial surface hydrophobicity  <cit> . the alternaria brassicicola ortholog of this gene is important for the development and integrity of conidia  <cit> . inspection of the t. virens genomic region near tex <dig> revealed a cytochrome p <dig> , which was also significantly down-regulated . additional members of this putative chnps4-like cluster were not significantly down-regulated . members of secondary metabolite biosynthetic clusters are known to be pacc-regulated in other fungi as well  <cit> . it would be rather surprising if all of secondary metabolism were to be downregulated at alkaline ph in trichoderma. two genes related to siderophore biosynthesis and import are indeed upregulated at alkaline ph in t. virens  and in other fungi as well . the sida gene, id  <dig>  is located near a predicted nrps gene: id  <dig>  tex <dig>  <cit> . tex <dig> is the ortholog of c. heterostrophus nps <dig>  and is responsible for the biosynthesis of the intracellular siderophore  <cit> . however, although tex <dig> is clustered with sida, it is not coregulated with it. the siderophore transporter id  <dig> shown in figure  <dig> is clustered in the genome with id  <dig>  a predicted nrps gene showing 41% identity with chnps <dig> of c. heterostrophus. the transcript corresponding to id  <dig> is co-regulated with the siderophore transporter id  <dig> . we note that there is no functional information for the gene corresponding to protein id  <dig>  the most closely related nrps to chnps <dig> in t. virens is a different gene, which corresponds to protein id  <dig>  <cit> , and unfortunately is not represented in the microarray probe set. t. reesei also has two paralogous nps6-like genes  <cit> .

eight clearly-annotated genes encoding ion transporters were in the alkaline-upregulated, pacc dependent group . these are of interest because of the importance of maintaining ion homeostasis, which is also tightly linked to ph homeostasis. the p-type atpase ena <dig> of fusarium oxysporum , for example, is known to be required for growth at alkaline ph and high salt  <cit> . ena <dig> was one of the first targets of rim <dig>  to be studied in saccharomyces cereviseae <cit> . protein id  <dig> is annotated as a zip zinc transporter. these zinc transporters have been studied in fungal pathogens: for example, zrfa–c of a. fumigatus are regulated by ph and by available zn levels  <cit> . zrt <dig> of candida albicans is important for virulence, possibly via the maintenance of cell wall integrity.

to test whether ena <dig> is involved in the pacc related phenotypes, we proceeded to construct a knockout mutant, Δena <dig>  in which this gene was replaced by the hygromycin b resistance cassette, using the split-marker procedure  <cit>  as described above for pacc. growth on acidic and alkaline ph and colony morphology of Δena <dig> were normal. likewise, Δena <dig> performed similarly to wt in confrontation assays with r. solani, and with s. rolfsii . it is not surprising that the deletion of a single gene did not account for the effect of a global regulator like pacc. thus, we reason that either there may be redundant p-type atpase genes, or that a loss of a combination of factors may be required to account for the Δpacc phenotype.

some additional examples of ph and/or pacc-regulated genes are given in table  <dig>  an ortholog of dfg <dig>  a cell-wall glycoprotein involved in tolerance to alkaline ph in candida albicans, is upregulated 324-fold by alkaline ph in wt, but not in Δpacc. in s. cerevisiae, expression of this gene depends on alkaline ph stress and on the cell wall integrity mapk slt <dig>  <cit> , suggesting joint control of gene expression in response to high ph by pacc and by the cell wall integrity pathway. protein id  <dig> is similar to gpr1/fun34/yaah, an ammonia exporter  gene which is upregulated by alkaline ph in colletotrichum gloeosporioides <cit> . to gain a more comprehensive biological interpretation it will be necessary to carry out a functional study of ph-regulated genes.

secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes whose expression is not necessary at high ph could be expected to be downregulated. this would occur if interaction with particular soil microorganisms did not pose a threat  in an alkaline environment. in contrast, siderophores are necessary for fe uptake, which becomes increasingly difficult at higher ph. the export of ammonia increases ph. the increase in the level of the transcript for an ammonia transporter  suggests that ammonia export is upregulated with increasing ph. this would indicate a quorum-sensing like feedback mechanism, in which local alkalinization is self-reinforcing. in this respect, it would be interesting to compare a foliar pathogen  with a rhizosphere resident .

predicted pacc binding sites
in aspergillus nidulans, pacc binds 5-gccarg- <dig> sequences upstream of ph-responsive genes, and can activate or repress transcription of those genes  <cit> . to determine whether this target sequence could be conserved in t. virens, we quantified the number of predicted pacc binding sites in the 1 kb regions upstream of the start codon of each of the pacc-regulated genes . we found that there were  <dig>  instances per 1 kb for genes upregulated via pacc . the frequency at which this site appeared in random promoters,  <dig>  instances per 1 kb , is clearly much lower. no such enrichment was found for the pacc-downregulated genes . this suggests a different mode of regulation, i.e., direct for activation, and indirect for repression, of the pacc target genes.

cluster analysis performed on the averaged microarray data for each experimental treatment indicates a well-defined group that is upregulated at alkaline ph in wt but not in Δpacc ; this cluster includes ena <dig> . pacc itself also belongs to cluster 1: pacc transcript abundance is increased at ph  <dig> in wt. there is a small group of genes whose expression is pacc-dependent at ph  <dig> . acidic ph is not expected to promote proteolytic activation of the unprocessed, long form of pacc. this suggests the existence of a novel mechanism which could be studied by promoter analysis of this group. an additional group of genes responds to ph essentially as the wild type does, but their expression level is lower . thus, for this gene group, a pacc-dependent process regulates overall expression level. this regulation could consist of a gating process in which pacc increases the expression of genes that are initially regulated by a different transcription factor.

acid-regulated, pacc dependent ; expression gated by pacc at both ph  <dig> and ph  <dig> .

trichoderma spp. are widely used as biofungicides. even though approximately 60% of all registered biofungicides are trichoderma-based, the market size of biopesticides is only a small fraction of the total pesticide market, which is largely dominated by chemicals  <cit> . bioefficacy of trichoderma, like any other biocontrol agent, is bound to be strongly influenced by environmental factors. one of the major limitations of applying trichoderma in agricultural settings is its inability to operate in alkaline conditions, since the ph optima for trichoderma growth, development, and activities is in the range of 4– <dig>  <cit> . in this respect, an understanding of the ph signaling pathways might be instrumental in improving the bioefficacy of trichoderma spp. thus, this study was carried out with the goal of elucidating the role of the ph-responsive transcription factor pacc and the gene regulation network mediated by this transcription factor in the commercially used biofungicide t. virens. the phenotypes of loss- and gain-of-function pacc mutants studied here reveal the importance of this signaling pathway in development, and in the mycoparasitic interaction of t. virens with two important fungal pathogens, r. solani and s. rolfsii. the present study also indicates that ph regulation does not depend entirely on pacc, since we found a number of up- and downregulated genes whose dependence on ph was similar in the Δpacc mutant and wild type . this result points to the possible existence of a ph-sensing mechanism other than the pacc pathway, by which normal regulation takes place during the one-hour alkaline ph step, despite its adverse effect on the growth rate. it will be interesting to identify such alternative pathways. the pathway for transduction of ph signals in a. nidulans has been described as “mechanistically dissimilar to all other known eukaryotic signal transduction pathways”  <cit> . this makes it an attractive target for antifungals, as has been proposed, for similar reasons, for the two-component signaling pathways of bacteria  <cit> . in biocontrol, however, growth of the  pathogen is beneficial, so the reasoning usually applied to host-pathogen interactions would need to be reversed. strains could be selected for growth at different ambient soil ph or for growth in the rhizosphere of different crop plants. detection of ambient ph through pacc and other mechanisms, and the resulting ability to maintain ph homeostasis, are likely general requirements for a mycoparasite to attack the host, explaining the loss of biocontrol ability in t. harzianum pacc mutants  <cit> . genetic manipulation of the global ph-dependent regulator pacc or some of its downstream target genes may be relevant for optimization of biocontrol strains according to the local environment, crop plant, and fungal host.

CONCLUSIONS
our genome-wide analysis of pacc and ph regulation identified some genes that are well-known targets of regulation by ph, for example pacc itself and ena <dig>  we also found a large number of novel genes that are promising candidates for construction of loss-of-function mutants. several hypotheses can be proposed to explain why ph  regulation is important for mycoparasitism: ph homeostasis in the face of host-mediated changes in ambient ph, a signal provided by the host, and programming of expression of hydrolytic enzymes to be expressed near the ph optima for their activity. the results, while compatible with all these mechanisms, also indicate a more complex picture. for example, several genes encoding enzymes predicted to have acid ph optima are expressed at alkaline ph. thus, an initial alkaline ph signal may anticipate varying ph during the fungal-fungal interaction. measurement of local ph at the microscopic level, in real time during the interaction, could provide further insight. we anticipate that gene knockout and overexpression of candidate genes identified here will be helpful in improving the ph adaptability of the most popular biofungicides, i.e., trichoderma spp.
