BACKGROUND
pulmonary arterial hypertension  is a life-threatening disease characterized by a sustained elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance  <cit> . essential pathological characteristics of pah are excessive proliferation and migration of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells , leading to medial hypertrophy and vascular remodeling  <cit> . pasmcs are maintained in a quiescent and non-migratory state under normal condition. however, pasmcs proliferation and migration are significantly promoted in response to various growth factors and cytokines, such as platelet-derived growth factor-bb , fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor- <dig>  tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin- <dig> .

pdgf is the most potent mitogenic factor for vascular smooth muscle cells , and exerts its actions via binding and activating two pdgf receptor  subtypes, pdgfrα and pdgfrβ . abundant evidence reveals that pdgf is a major contributor to the pathobiology of vascular disorders including pah  <cit> . pdgf ligands are upregulated in lung tissue and pulmonary cells in monocrotaline - and hypoxia-induced experimental pah animal . similar alterations with upregulation of pdgf ligands and pdgfrβ were found in lung tissue and small pulmonary arteries of patients with pah  <cit> . imatinib, a pdgf receptor antagonist, has been reported to dramatically improve pah in some human cases as well as animal models, but serious side effects and drug discontinuation are common  <cit> . therefore, it is particularly necessary to investigate gene expression alteration globally in pasmcs induced by pdgf-bb.

previously, shirvani and his colleagues have globally determined the effect of pdgf on transcription factor chf1/hey2-knockout vsmcs and demonstrate that chf1/hey <dig> profoundly affects vascular smooth muscle phenotype by altering both the absolute expression level of a variety of genes and the kinetics of growth factor-induced gene expression.  <cit> . in another report, lee et al. have analyzed the gene expression profile with multiple whole-genome expression array datasets and identified nfat family members and target genes as important effectors of vsmcs in response to pdgf  <cit> . these studies were mainly based on traditional high throughput technology, such as microarray, which covered only portion of the whole genome  <cit> . in addition, a recent study has integrated proteomic and transcriptomic profiles and identified a novel pdgf-myc network in bladder smooth muscle cells  <cit> , however, this kind of analysis in pasmcs is still lacking.

to better understand how pdgf-bb regulates gene expression in pasmcs, we performed the integrated analysis of transcriptome and proteome changes in response to pdgf-bb stimulation in rat pasmcs , based on next generation sequencing and relative and absolute quantification  technology. our analysis revealed a significant role of smad <dig> in pdgf-bb induced gene expression. further study demonstrated that pdgf-bb-induced mir-376b upregulation mediated the downregulation of bmpr <dig>  which led to expression change of smad <dig> targets and promoted proliferation of pasmcs.

RESULTS
profiling of mrna expression in response to pdgf-bb
rna deep-sequencing was carried out to identify differentially expressed genes in response to pdgf-bb. total rna samples for rna-seq analysis were obtained from rpasmcs following pdgf-bb  exposure for  <dig> or 12 h . every sample generated more than  <dig> , <dig> reads after quality control, and  <dig>  mrna transcripts were identified with  <dig> novel transcripts that have not been reported in rat. by quantitative analysis,  <dig> transcripts were revealed to express differentially in response to pdgf-bb  ≥ 2), with  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated .fig.  <dig> transcriptome analysis of rpasmcs treated with pdgf-bb. a, rna sequencing heatmap showing a subset of genes differentially expressed upon rpasmcs treated with pdgf-bb for 12 h ; b, gene ontology  analysis was carried out on genes differentially expressed, heatmap showing total expression of genes in the most enriched go terms; c, the most enriched pathways of differentially expressed genes, analyzing via kegg pathway; d, the network was constructed with genes differentially expressed and their potential corresponded transcription factors , showing the  <dig> most enriched tfs , color of line represented the enrichment level. as to a go or kegg term, rich factor =  / , qvalue is p-value adjusted by method “benjamini and hochberg”




next, gene ontology  analysis was performed with kobas  <dig>  online software   <cit> . results showed that these differentially expressed genes were enriched significantly in go terms involved in cell proliferation, such as cell cycle, dna replication and cell division , suggesting the significant role of pdgf-bb in smooth muscle cell proliferation as reported previously  <cit> . kegg  pathway analysis suggested that differentially expressed genes were enriched significantly in cell cycle, dna replication, pi3k-akt signaling pathway, hif- <dig> signaling pathway, focal adhesion. all of these pathways are functionally involved in cell proliferation and migration . to find out the potential transcription factors  mediating pdgf-bb regulation on these differentially expressed mrna, tf-targets data were collected from tred database  <cit>  and compared to differentially expressed mrnas. data analysis revealed that e2f <dig>  hifa, jun, tp <dig>  atf, esr <dig>  est <dig>  ets <dig>  smad <dig> and nfkb <dig> were top  <dig> tfs in response to pdgf-bb stimulation , partly consistent with previous reports on bladder smooth muscle cells  <cit> . interestingly, we identified as the first time that smad <dig>  an essential tf in bmpr2/smads signaling pathway was regulated by pdgf-bb , implying a potential link between bmpr2/smads signaling and pdgf-bb stimulation.

profiling of protein expression in response to pdgf-bb
itraq-based proteomics analysis was performed in rpasmcs treated with pdgf-bb in three time points . totally,  <dig> proteins were identified from  <dig>  peptides matched with  <dig>  spectra at a fdr  of 5 %,  <dig> of which matched to two or more peptides. among them,  <dig> proteins were differentially expressed in response to pdgf-bb stimulation for  <dig> or 24 h , with  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated .fig.  <dig> protenome analysis of rpasmcs treated with pdgf-bb. a, heatmap displaying a subset of proteins differentially expressed upon rpasmcs treated  <dig> or 24 h with pdgf-bb , measured via itraq; b, go analysis showing the most enriched go term on differentially expressed proteins in response to pdgf-bb; c, the most enriched pathway of proteins differentially expressed, analyzing via kegg pathway; d, the network was constructed with differentially expressed proteins and their potential corresponded transcription factors , displaying the  <dig> significantly enriched tfs , color of line represented the enrichment level. as to a go or kegg term, rich factor =  / , qvalue is p-value adjusted by method “benjamini and hochberg”




go analysis suggested the differentially expressed protein were also enriched in go terms involved in proliferation and migration, such as focal adhesion, stress fiber and wound healing . in kegg pathway analysis, only one pathway was showed to be enriched significantly. however, among the  <dig> most enriched pathways, focal adhesion and regulation of actin cytoskeleton were involved tightly in migration and proliferation . tf-target analysis suggested that differentially expressed proteins majorly enriched in the tfs including myc, hifa, usf, jun and rel . interestingly, differentially expressed proteins were enriched significantly in smad <dig> as in mrna level .

comparison and integration of transcriptome and proteome
to further identify pdgf-bb mediated gene expression, the datasets from rna-seq and itraq were applied for the integrated analysis. totally,  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed at both mrna and protein levels . the correlation analysis suggested that these genes expressed in high correlation in the two levels . in addition, the integrated analysis of tfs-target suggested that differentially expressed genes enriched significantly in hif1a, jun, est <dig>  ets <dig>  smad <dig>  fos, sp <dig>  stat <dig>  lef <dig> and cebpb, at both mrna and proteins levels . it is well known that bmpr2/smad <dig> axis plays critical role during the pah initiation and development  <cit> . hence we chose potential targets of smads for further analysis. kegg pathway analysis suggested that these differentially expressed targets enriched significantly in pi3k-akt signaling pathway, focal adhesion and cell cycle, and all these pathways play significant roles in cell proliferation and migration .fig.  <dig> comparison and integration of differential transcriptome and proteome. a, venn diagram revealing  <dig> genes expressed differentially in both mrna and protein levels; b, differential expression of these  <dig> genes was significantly correlated ; c, integration of tf-target network at proteome and transcriptome levels, color of line represented the enrichment level; d, the most enriched pathway of differentially expressed genes corresponding to smad family, analyzing via kegg pathway. as to a kegg term, rich factor =  / , q value is p-value adjusted by method “benjamini and hochberg”




validation of differentially expressed mrna identified via rna-sequencing
our interest focused on the proliferation, migration and differentiation of pasmcs, hence those differentially expressed targets of smads involved in these processes were chosen for validation via qrt-pcr . the results showed that, bambi, edn <dig> and id <dig> presented time-dependent downregulation in response to pdgf-bb treatment. on the other hand, myc, cdkn1a, jun, col <dig>  tgfb <dig>  gja <dig>  col5a <dig> and ctnnb <dig> displayed time-dependent upregulation in response to pdgf-bb treatment. the results from qrt-pcr assays were consistent with rna-sequencing data, except for myc .fig.  <dig> differential expression of smad family tfs in response to pdgf-bb was due to downregulation of bmpr <dig>  a, differentially expressed genes corresponding to smad involved in  <dig> major cellular procedures; b, q-pcr validated the expression of part of smad family targets, which were identified to express differentially in response to pdgf-bb via rna-sequencing; bmpr <dig> was detected in rapsmcs treated with pdgf-bb  via western blot at protein level c and qrt-pcr at mrna level d, e, n =  <dig>  *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig>  vs 0 h or 0 ng/ml




taken all results above together, we revealed a significant role of smad <dig> in regulating pdgf-bb induced gene expression. next we would try to explore how pdgf-bb impacts smad <dig> to regulate the corresponding gene expression.

downregulation of bmpr <dig> led to expression alteration of smads targets
to explore what accounted for smad1-involved gene expression in pdgf-bb stimulated rpasmcs, data from rna-sequencing and itraq assay were analyzed and bmpr <dig> was found to be downregulated in response to pdgf-bb treatment both in mrna and protein levels. as well known, bmpr <dig> is the core upstream regulator in bmpr2/smads signaling. through bmrp2-dependent bmrp <dig> activation, smad <dig> translocates into nucleus and interacts with other transcription factors to regulate gene expression, negatively or positively  <cit> . western blot confirmed that bmpr <dig> protein downregulated in response to pdgf-bb with time-dependent manner in rpasmcs . qrt-pcr also validated that bmpr <dig> mrna altered with time- and dose- dependent manner in response to pdgf-bb in rpasmcs . taken together, theses data suggested that pdgf-bb induced bmpr <dig> downregulation could be causative of expression alteration of smads targets.

mir-376b mediated the downregulation of bmpr2
to determine if pdgf-bb regulates bmpr <dig> expression in post-transcriptional level, we next explored whether mirnas involved in downregulation of bmpr <dig>  our lab has investigated the expression profiling of  <dig> mirnas and identified a group of mirnas differentially expressing in hpasmcs treated by pdgf-bb  <cit> . among them,  <dig> mirnas were significantly changed in both human and rat pasmcs, with  <dig>  upregulated and  <dig>  downregulated in response to pdgf-bb . further study suggested that expression of these  <dig> mirnas also changed with time-dependent manner following pdgf-bb treatment in rpasmcs .fig.  <dig> bmpr <dig> is a potential direct target of mir-376b. a, heatmap showed relative level of mirnas following pdgf-bb treatment for different time; b, bmpr <dig> protein level was detected in rpasmcs transfected with mirna mimics via western blot; c, the two conserved mir-376b binding sites in the 3′-utr of bmpr <dig> along with the mutation sites, respectively; d, 3′-utr luciferase reporter assay with target sites and their mutant along with mir-376b/mir-con mimics. bar charts of luciferase reporter analysis represent means ± sd , *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig>  vs mir-con/3′utr of targets




using online prediction tool of targetscan , multiple binding sites of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir-376b respectively were identified in bmpr <dig> 3’utr. to test whether bmpr <dig> is a direct target of these  <dig> mirnas, the effect of mirna mimic on bmpr <dig> protein level was detected firstly. western blot showed that only mir-376b mimic could inhibit bmpr <dig> protein level . in addition, hek- <dig> cells that co-transfected with mir-376b mimic and a luciferase construct containing sequence of bmpr <dig> 3’utr resulted in significant decrease in luciferase activity , but not mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> . two potential mir-376b binding sites within bmpr <dig> 3’utr have been identified via targetscan , however, they exhibited great difference in their susceptibility to mir-376b mediated repression. mutation on the first binding site  completely abolished the inhibitory effect caused by mir-376b, but not the second binding site mutated  . together, these data demonstrated that upregulation of mir-376b in response to pdgf-bb repressed the bmpr <dig> protein level post-transcriptionally.

mir-376b promoted proliferation of rpasmcs
a series of reports have suggested that downregulation of bmpr <dig> promoted proliferation of pasmcs  <cit> . therefore, we investigated whether mir-376b could impact proliferation of rpasmcs. edu incorporation assay showed that, mir-376b mimic significantly promoted proliferation of rpasmcs . this data further demonstrated that mir-376b could inhibit bmpr <dig> expression and promote proliferation of rpasmcs.fig.  <dig> mir-376b promoted rpasmcs proliferation. a, rpasmcs transfected with mir-376b or control mimic were incubated with edu solution for 4 h, and then were fixed and stained with apollo dye  and dapi ; b, bar charts showing relative edu incorporation rate in mir-376b transfected rpasmcs, n =  <dig>  data are shown as mean ± sd. *p <  <dig>  vs control mimic; c, bar charts showing quantification of mir-376b in transfected rpasmcs. n =  <dig>  data are shown as means ± sd, ***p <  <dig>  vs control; d, model depicting pdgf-bb promoted proliferation via regulating mir-376b-induced bmpr <dig> decrease




in summary, this study integrated transcriptome and proteome and discovered that, in response to pdgf-bb, mir-376b was upregulated to repress bmpr <dig> level. decreased bmpr <dig> further impact downstream smads and altered target genes expression, which promoted proliferation of rpasmcs .

discussion
pdgf signaling plays important role in pulmonary vascular remodeling, however, the detail mechanism underlying this process remains elusive. there has been a set of genome-wide studies about pdgf-responsive gene expression in vsmcs, which mainly based on traditional high throughput technology, such as microarray, covering only portion of the whole transcriptome  <cit> . moreover, the four fundamental cellular processes, including transcription, mrna degradation, translation and protein degradation, make the correlation between mrna and protein more complicated. therefore, integrated analysis of mrna and protein levels would provide more comprehensive information to understand gene regulation  <cit> . however, integrating transcriptome and proteome in vsmcs is still lacking  <cit> . in this study, we utilized the next generation sequencing, combining itraq isobaric labeling technology to globally study the gene expression regulation in pasmcs in response to pdgf-bb. our results confirmed the crucial role of transcription factors jun and myc in pasmcs proliferation and migration, as previously suggested  <cit> . moreover, our integrated analysis extended the understanding of pdgf-bb function on pasmcs, revealing the crosstalk between pdgf signaling and bmpr2/smads axis mediated by mir-376b. previous report suggested that bmp/bmpr2/smads signaling prevented pdgf-bb–induced proliferation of pasmcs by decreasing nuclear phospho-erk via its transcriptional target apoe  <cit> . our work suggested that pdgf signaling could regulate bmpr2/smads signaling and hence promote the proliferation of pasmc in the other hand.

integrated analysis indicated that pdgf-bb impacted targets expression of  <dig> transcription factors, namely hif1a, jun, est <dig>  ets <dig>  smad <dig>  fos, sp <dig>  stat <dig>  lef <dig> and cebpb , both in mrna and protein level. mutations or downregulation of bmpr <dig> is presented in most cases of heritable pah , indicating a functional role of bmpr <dig> in pah initiation/progression  <cit> . hence we focused on exploring the effect of pdgf-bb on bmp/bmpr2/smads signaling. in this study, we identified  <dig> alternatively expressed genes that are potential targets of bmp/bmpr2/smads axis. among them bambi, edn <dig> and id <dig> were downregulated in a time-dependent manner, while myc, cdkn1a, jun, col <dig>  tgfb <dig>  gja <dig>  col5a <dig> and ctnnb <dig> were upregulated . these genes have been annotated with important roles in mediating the proliferation, migration and differentiation of pasmcs , and our finding further suggested their cooperation in mediating the pdgf-induced dysfunction of pasmcs. for instance, since bambi negatively regulates tgf-β-family signaling  <cit> , bambi downregulation and tgfb <dig> upregulation indicated that pdgf signaling could positively regulate tgf-β signaling. previous reports showed that tgf-β signaling inhibits pasmcs proliferation in normal condition but promotes proliferation in bmpr2-mutated pasmcs  <cit> . therefore, activated pdgf signaling in pasmcs would lead to increased tgf-β signaling and reduced bmp signaling, both of which are implicated in pah pathogenesis. hif1a is another tf deserved paying attention to, since many reports have suggested the important role of hif1a in pulmonary vascular remodeling  <cit> . our analysis revealed that, differentially expressed genes in response to pdgf-bb were enriched the most significantly in hif1a, in both mrna and protein levels . hence, our data indicated the tight connection between pdgf signaling and hypoxia, which has received little attention  <cit> .

few researches have focused on the regulation of bmpr <dig> expression in pasmcs. a report suggested that mir- <dig> potentially suppressed bmpr <dig> protein level  <cit> . microrna  is a group of small endogenous noncoding single-strand rnas , which negatively regulate gene expression in translation phase  <cit> . mirna has been emerged as key player in cardiovascular diseases and cancer development and progression and, more recently, in pah pathogenesis  <cit> . several groups has globally explored the differentially expressed mirnas in response to pdgf-bb in pasmcs. for example, brandi n. d and his colleagues cloned and sequenced mirnas expressed in pasmcs under vehicle- or pdgf-bb-treated conditions and found that mir- <dig> was one of the few mirnas enriched in pdgf-bb-treated pasmcs, which served as a modulator of the phenotypic change of pasmcs via targeting c-kit and p27kip <dig>  <cit> . li et al. colleagues performed mirna microarray analysis in human aortic smooth muscle cells  stimulated with pdgf-bb and identified mir- <dig> as one of the most significantly downregulated mirna in human vsmcs in response to pdgf-bb stimulation  <cit> . together, these data highlighted the contribution of the mirna regulation in pdgf signaling pathway. our lab utilized an improved mirna detection assay, s-poly  plus assay, to profile the expression of  <dig> mirnas and found  <dig> mirnas with altered expression in hpasmcs after pdgf-bb stimulation. to investigate whether mirnas involved in pdgf-bb induced bmpr <dig> downregulation, online software targetscan were used to predict the binding sites of those  <dig> mirnas,  <dig> of which possessed the potential binding sites in the 3’utr of bmpr <dig>  however, western blot showed that only mir-376b mimic could inhibit the expression of bmpr <dig> protein.

our data suggested that pdgf-bb treatment induced downregulation of bmpr <dig> not only at protein level but also at mrna level. mir-376b could inhibit the expression of bmpr <dig> at protein level , however, bmpr <dig> mrna in pasmcs remained unchanged after mir-376b mimic transfection , suggesting the inhibitory effect of mir-376b on bmpr <dig> is posttranscriptional. as to the transcriptional regulation of bmpr <dig> expression, previous study showed that bmpr <dig> transcription could be affected by methylation and acetylation in endothelial cells  <cit> . however, it appeared not the case in pasmc upon pdgf stimulation, as suppressed methylation with 5-azacytidine and deacetylation with trichostatin a failed to recover the bmpr <dig> mrna levels inhibited by pdgf-bb . therefore, we hypothesize that pdgf-bb regulates bmpr <dig> transcription through impacting promoter activity and further investigation is needed to verify this hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results provided the first systems-level integrated analysis of pdgf-bb-regulated transcriptome, proteome and mirnaome  in pasmcs. the results demonstrated that pdgf-bb-induced mir-376b upregulation mediated bmpr <dig> downregulation, which led to expression change of its target genes and promoted proliferation of pasmcs.
