BACKGROUND
the human epidermal growth factor receptors  belong to the receptor tyrosine kinase superfamily. they are key regulators of physiological processes such as cell proliferation, survival, and migration  <cit> . the first three members of this receptor family, egfr/her <dig>  her <dig> and her <dig>  play important roles in carcinogenesis, and they are often co-expressed  <cit> . her receptors are highly homologous and their activation occurs through similar biochemical steps, although certain properties of the receptor members are distinct. for example, her <dig> receptors have no known ligand and her <dig> lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity  <cit> , and upon ligand binding, they all undergo conformation changes that favor the formation or stabilization of receptor hetero- and homo-dimers  <cit> . this results in receptor phosphorylation, and the resultant formation of complexes with adaptor proteins to initiate signaling. this cascade of events leads to downstream signal transduction, and can trigger diverse biological responses  <cit> .

almost every possible pairwise combination of her dimers has been reported  <cit> . ligand availability  <cit> , the cellular repertoire of these her receptors  <cit> , and the receptor dimerization hierarchy  <cit>  are the major determinants of the dimer formation kinetics. each her receptor appears to have a characteristic repertoire of adaptor proteins depending on its dimerization partner  <cit> . thus, the types of receptor homo- and hetero-dimers that are formed, and the signal transduction pathways that are activated depend upon the specifics of the system and treatment conditions. this severely complicates the modeling of the her signaling pathways and the investigation of the her-initiated cellular responses  <cit> .

biomedical and biomolecular studies have shown that inhibition of her dimerization and her-mediated signaling can be an extremely effective therapeutic strategy  <cit> . in her <dig> positive breast cancers, heterodimer interactions between her <dig> and its partners are often constitutively activated and their disruption has proven to be an effective means for inhibiting her2-mediated aberrant responses  <cit> . her <dig> overexpression has also been shown to correlate with poor prognosis in epithelial cancers  <cit> . activation of pro-survival responses through the her <dig> pathway can also lead to drug resistance in cancer treatment  <cit> . further, interactions between members of the her family and signaling redundancies can also contribute to drug resistance when specific inhibitors are used against a single her receptor  <cit> . thus, the use of combination therapeutics that target multiple members of the her family of receptors is advocated as an effective treatment strategy for a variety of tumors  <cit> .

in terms of downstream elements, her receptors activate the mapk/mek/erk and pi3k/pkb/akt signaling pathways  <cit> , which are thought to be the general mitogenic and pro-survival pathways, respectively. many stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, ligands for g protein-coupled receptors, transforming agents, and carcinogens, activate the erk  pathway. sustained erk activation can have significant functional consequences  <cit> . for example, constitutive or prolonged erk activation through her receptors contributes to speedy cell migration  <cit>  and enhances cell transformation and resistance to apoptosis  <cit> . the serine/threonine kinase akt promotes cellular survival by blocking apoptosis, which it achieves by binding and regulating many downstream effectors; e.g., nf-κb, bcl- <dig> family proteins, and mdm <dig>  <cit> . akt also induces protein synthesis and therefore plays a role in tissue growth. akt has been implicated in many types of cancers because of its possible role in angiogenesis and tumor development  <cit> . in particular her <dig> is known to have a unique ability to efficiently engage the pro-survival pi3k/akt pathway  <cit> .

as summarized above, many aspects of her signaling have been well examined over the years. however, the body of knowledge has been constructed from in vitro studies that use different cell lines and treatment conditions. unfortunately, the characteristics of cellular signaling pathways can be cell line- and condition-dependent, as evidenced by conflicting reports and incomplete understanding about particular aspects of the her system. for example, earlier studies have unquestionably established that her <dig> plays a key role in her signaling. however, how her <dig> functions is still uncertain after numerous studies. in particular, it is not clear whether her <dig> is merely a preferred dimerization partner of other her receptors or whether it mediates lateral information transfer between them  <cit> . furthermore, the role of her <dig> seems to be different in different cells lines and under different conditions  <cit> . the existing ideas about the interaction mechanisms between the her receptors  <cit> , and the role of her <dig> in facilitating the interaction between egfr and her <dig> can be summarized in the form of the distinct hypotheses illustrated in figure  <dig>  briefly,  egfr and her <dig> receptors interact directly, i.e., her <dig> is not required;  her <dig> is the explicit facilitator of a lateral interaction; and  egfr and her <dig> do not interact with each other but both of them independently interact with her <dig>  in addition to the heterodimerization-mediated activation of receptors, egfr can also be activated through the formation of homodimers. however, her <dig>  which does not bind ligand, and her <dig>  which is kinase inactive, are only activated through heterodimerization.

these conflicting observations about the possible role of her <dig> illustrate the context dependence of cellular signaling. hence, in order to understand the interactions between the her molecules under physiological and pathological conditions, we not only need to study systems expressing different levels of these receptors, but also need to do so in a common cellular background to ensure internal consistency of the generated datasets. this is the main objective of our study: we have developed a clone library of human mammary epithelial  cell lines that express endogenous levels of egfr and varying levels of her <dig> and her <dig> to experimentally examine the various hypothesized roles of her <dig> in coupling egfr and her <dig> activation . results of our systematic investigation indicate that, although her <dig> is the preferred dimerization partner for both the egfr and her <dig>  it only weakly couples egfr and her <dig> activation in hme cells. her <dig> plays a significant role in the activation of egfr and her <dig> in response to their respective ligands, but the presence of her <dig> does not lead to strong crosstalk  between egfr and her <dig> receptors. we also find that the observed weak coupling is largely unidirectional, i.e., egfr ligands can induce her <dig> activation in the presence of her <dig> but the stimulation of the her <dig> pathway by its ligand does not induce egfr activation regardless of the presence of her <dig>  the receptor activation patterns reported here provide us with information on the her interaction hierarchy in hme cells.

the second objective of our study is to investigate how the changes in the activation levels of her1- <dig> receptors alter the phosphorylation patterns of downstream effectors erk and akt upon ligand stimulation. in parallel experiments using the developed clone cell library, egfr and her <dig> were stimulated using their respective ligands egf and heregulin , and erk and akt phosphorylation levels were measured. our results indicate that her <dig> activation is the strongest inducer of akt activation in hme cells. we also observe that, even though it is at a lower level compared to stimulation through the egfr, erk activation occurs at significant levels upon her <dig> stimulation. even though the observed akt phosphorylation pattern is similar to earlier measurements using the mcf- <dig> human breast cancer cell line  <cit> , erk activation patterns in hme cells are different than in mcf- <dig> cells  <cit> . this yet again shows that a comprehensive investigation of the her signaling system in a consistent cellular background is warranted.

we note that, unlike many model cell lines with limited physiological responses to growth factors, hme cells are an excellent model system for studying the properties of the her system because, like many epithelium derived cell types, hme cells require egfr activation for proper proliferation and migration responses  <cit> . the 184a <dig> strain of hme cells that was used to develop our clone library retains the egfr-dependent regulatory machinery of the primary cell type from which it was derived  <cit> . thus, the data obtained in our study provide relevant information for developing directed and effective medical treatments for aberrant responses in epithelial cells.

methods
epidermal growth factor  and heregulin-β <dig>  were purchased from peprotech . all elisa assay kits were purchased from r&d systems inc. . humanized monoclonal antibodies 7c <dig>  2c <dig>  and 4d <dig>  were generous gifts from genentech, inc. . all the other reagents were from sigma  unless otherwise indicated.

generation of hme cell lines
the human mammary epithelial  cell line 184a1l <dig> was initially provided by martha stampfer  and maintained at 37°c in 5% co2/air in dfci- <dig> medium supplemented with  <dig>  ng/ml egf as described in  <cit> . this parental cell line expresses high levels of egfr and relatively low copy numbers of her <dig> and her <dig> and is labeled the her2-/3- cell line in our study.

this parental cell line was used to create the her <dig> overexpressing cell line by retroviral transduction, as described elsewhere  <cit> . briefly, the retroviral mfg vector containing her <dig> was constructed and transfected into the ψ crip packaging cell line  <cit> . the transfected clones with highest level of her <dig> expression were expanded to produce viral supernatant. this supernatant was then used to infect the hme cells. individual clones of retrovirus transduced hme cells were isolated using cloning rings. the degree of her <dig> overexpression was determined by immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and equilibrium-binding studies using labeled fab fragments. growth medium for the her <dig> expressing cells was the same as that of the parental hme cells except for addition of the antibiotic g <dig>  to ensure selection.

her <dig> expressing cells were derived in a similar retrovirus-based strategy. retroviral pbm-irespuro vector containing her <dig> and the puromycin resistance gene was transfected into the phoenix packaging cells  <cit> . viral supernatant was collected from transiently transfected phoenix cells. the supernatant was then used to infect the parental hme cells and the her <dig> expressing cells  to create the her <dig> expressing and her2-her <dig> coexpressing cell lines, respectively . the cell lines expressing her <dig> were then grown in the dfci- <dig> medium with the addition of  <dig> μg/ml puromycin .

a an egfr expression level of  <dig> k for the her2-/3- cell line and a her <dig> expression level of  <dig> k for her2+/3- cell line were reported previously  <cit> .

b these egfr and her <dig> expression levels were calculated by normalizing the receptor masses measured in elisa experiments with the respective egfr and her <dig> expression levels shown in item  above.

c these her <dig> expression levels were calculated by normalizing the receptor masses measured in elisa experiments with the egfr receptor expression level shown in item  above. detected expression values were validated by re-computing them based on relative readings with respect to her <dig> expression.

d this is also roughly the detection limit in our elisa experiments.

the stability of clone cell lines over growth passages was consistently monitored, and they were stable for at least  <dig> passages. still, in our study, only the cells at low passages were utilized to generate experimental data, and cells were maintained under g <dig> and puromycin selection as appropriate to ensure transduction efficiency. we note that the parental cell line refers to the original 184a1l <dig> cells, which were not mock transfected by an empty vector. we also note that we use the term "cell library" to refer to our clone library of sub-lines of this parental hme cell type.

the abundances of her receptors on all the generated clones were characterized using flow cytometry, with alexa- <dig> conjugated mab 7c <dig> against her <dig> and pe conjugated anti-her <dig> antibody  against her <dig>  respectively. expression levels of her receptors were further confirmed by elisa assays.

cell activation
when cells grew to near confluency, regular culture medium was replaced with dfci- <dig> medium lacking all supplements but  <dig> % bovine serum albumin. cells were then quiescenced for 12- <dig> hours before stimulation. cells were activated through her receptors by adding either  <dig> ng/ml egf or  <dig> ng/ml hrg, or both, into the culture medium. activated cells were incubated at 37°c for fixed amounts of time between  <dig> to  <dig> hours. samples were then collected by cooling cells down to 4°c on ice and lysing cells using lysis buffer. in the experiments with antibody blocking,  <dig> μg/ml antibody  was preincubated with cells for four hours before ligand addition. at least two independent measurements were performed, with two biological replicates in each experiment, for every treatment condition. additional experiments where the cells were grown to ~50% confluency were pursued to investigate the dependence of signaling properties on cell confluency. culture plates with 50% confluency were obtained by seeding the plates with an initial cell density that was half of those of fully confluent plates.

cell lysis
to lyse the cells and prepare samples for receptor mass and activated/phosphorylated receptor quantification, we solubilized cells with ice cold lysis buffer for  <dig> min ). cell lysates were collected with a scraper. lysates were centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> min at 4°c, and the supernatants were transferred into fresh microtubes. obtained cell lysates were either analyzed immediately or stored at a -80°c freezer until needed.

the steps to prepare cell lysates for detecting erk and akt and their activation levels were similar as above, except lysis buffer was replaced with  <dig> mm edta,  <dig> % triton x- <dig>   <dig> mm naf,  <dig> m urea,  <dig> mm activated sodium orthovanadate, 1% protease inhibitor cocktail iii,  <dig> μm pmsf and  <dig>  mm sodium pyrophosphate, in pbs, ph  <dig> - <dig> .

quantification of receptor mass, receptor phosphorylation, and erk/akt activation
the receptor masses and phosphorylation levels of the egfr/her2/her <dig> receptors, and erk/akt phosphorylation levels were quantified in elisa experiments. r&d duoset ic elisa kits were used in these measurements. before each elisa assay, protein concentration of cell lysate was measured using the bicinchoninic acid protein quantitation kit . the manufacture's protocol was followed in all elisa measurements except for the assays to detect receptor  masses . for the latter, to be able to monitor the reaction dynamically during our measurements, the r&d elisa protocol was modified. rather than using streptavidin-hrp to bind a biotinylated detection antibody, we used streptavidin conjugated with alkaline phosphatase  and incubated the assay plate for one hour at 37°c. afterwards, freshly made  <dig> mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate in diethanolamine buffer  was added to start the reaction. the absorbance from the elisa reagents was detected immediately using a molecular devices microplate reader's kinetic setup at  <dig> nm for  <dig> min .

RESULTS
expression of egfr/her2/her <dig> in hme cells
her receptor expression was examined in all cell lines using facs . our previous study indicated an egfr expression level of  <dig>  and a her <dig> expression of  <dig>  for the parental  cell line, and a her <dig> expression level of  <dig>  for the her <dig> overexpressing clone her2+/3-  <cit> . total receptor masses were quantified using elisa assays in all of our cell lines, and the results were used to estimate the relative receptor expression levels. table  <dig> lists the abundances of egfr/her2/her <dig> in our previously reported  and newly obtained  cell lines and confirms that we have successfully constructed a series of related hme clones expressing endogenous egfr and co-expressing either her <dig>  her <dig>  or both. this clone cell library allows for the systematic examination of the her interaction patterns and the impact of different her dimer types on downstream signaling and cellular responses in hme cells. we note that, although we label her2-/3- and her2-/3+ cell lines as her <dig> negative these cells express low levels of her <dig>  our labeling is for notational convenience, and in our case her2- corresponds to the endogenous her <dig> level and means her <dig> was not transduced.

receptor activation patterns in hme cell library
we stimulated our cell lines with egfr ligand , with her <dig> ligand , and with both ligands simultaneously. this enabled us to examine the receptor activation patterns in four cell types stimulated with three different ligand combinations. we chose to use different egf and hrg concentrations because the response to  <dig> nm hrg is not as robust as the response to egf administration at the same dose. based on the measured binding affinities of these two ligands to their respective receptors  <cit> , the receptor binding ability of  <dig> nm hrg is comparable to that of  <dig> nm egf, thus offering a more sensible comparison of egfr and her <dig> pathway activation.

egfr activation
as shown in figure 2a, stimulating cells with egf induced egfr phosphorylation within minutes of ligand addition in all cell lines. stimulation of the her3- cell lines with hrg did not lead to statistically significant egfr activation. our data further indicates that:

i) when stimulated with egf, the presence of her <dig> and/or her <dig> does not have a major impact on the amplitude of egfr activation.

ii) the presence of her <dig>  but not her <dig>  prolongs egfr phosphorylation. the difference in phospho-egfr decay rates between her2-/3- and her2+/3- cell lines is noticeable in figure 2a . this is consistent with previous reports showing that heterodimer formation with her <dig> slows the internalization and degradation of the egfr thereby prolonging egfr signaling  <cit> . the p-value is  <dig>  when the decay rates are compared between her2-/3- and her2-/3+ cell lines, which indicate that her <dig> by itself does not significantly affect egfr phosphorylation. the effect of her <dig> on the egfr phosphorylation decay is evident even in cells expressing her <dig>  although this effect is statistically less significant . this indicates that her <dig> has a diminished interaction with the egfr when her <dig> is present in the system, most likely due to the competition because her <dig> is also the preferred dimerization partner of her <dig> 

iii) activation of her <dig> by its ligand hrg does not lead to sizable egfr transactivation. results for her2-/3+ and her2+/3+ cells in figure 2a show that the stimulation of the her <dig> pathway does not directly activate egfr regardless of the presence of her <dig>  this observed lack of transactivation supports the notion that while her <dig> is the main dimerization partner for the egfr and her <dig> receptors, contrary to earlier suggestions  <cit> , her <dig> is not an efficient lateral information carrier between her receptors in hme cells .

iv) egfr phosphorylation when both egf and hrg are added to the system is comparable to when egf is added alone . this observation is consistent with item  above, and it shows that egfr does not get transactivated following her <dig> activation.

her <dig> activation
her <dig> receptors are activated at high levels after egf stimulation in all her <dig> expressing hme cell lines , and receptor phosphorylation levels are maintained during the time course of one hour. we have observed a similar dynamic behavior before  <cit> . this prolonged activation is also observed when her <dig> is stimulated through her <dig> by addition of hrg. we further note that:

i) even though the hrg concentration used here is  <dig>  times that of egf and the ligand doses are equivalent when their receptor binding affinities are accounted for , her <dig> receptors are activated at a much lower levels through the hrg-stimulated her <dig> pathway than through the egf-stimulated egfr pathway. however, this might be due to the lower expression level of her <dig> in our cell library compared to egfr . when the her <dig> phosphorylation results for the her2+/3+ cell  in response to egf and hrg are normalized with respect to the egfr and her <dig> expression levels respectively , we find that the potencies of egfr and her <dig> for inducing her <dig> activation are roughly the same. this implies that her <dig> phosphorylation in heterodimers with egfr and her <dig> are comparable.

ii) when her <dig> is abundant, its activation through the egfr and her <dig> pathways are additive. comparison of the phospho-her <dig> levels in her2+/3+ cells between egf+hrg co-stimulation and only egf addition yields a p-value of  <dig> . the p-value for the comparison of her <dig> phosphorylation by both ligands egf+hrg in her2+/3+ and by egf activation in her2+/3- cells is  <dig> . as explained below, this suggests that her <dig> is the dominant dimerization partner for egfr and her <dig>  the receptor activation patterns in the system are determined by the competitive formation of the various dimer types, which is a complex function of the number of available receptors, the dimerization affinities and the stimulus conditions  <cit> . while it is difficult to measure the receptor dimerization patterns, it can be deduced by analyzing the receptor activation profiles in our cell lines. for instance, if egfr and her <dig> preferentially formed dimers with each other , co-stimulation with egf and hrg would result in increased phosphorylation of these two receptors rather than a significant increase in her <dig> activation. this is clearly not the case in our hme system . in contrast, if her <dig> is the dominant dimer partner for egfr and her <dig> , when there is abundant her <dig>  we would expect to see additive her <dig> activation when egf and hrg are added simultaneously.

her <dig> activation
activation of the system with egf leads to minimal levels of her <dig> phosphorylation. this latter observation further supports the notion that lateral information transfer from egfr activation to her <dig> activation is minimal. graus-porta et al have shown that activation of her <dig> by egf can occur via a direct interaction between her <dig> and her <dig> in t47d and skbr <dig> cells  <cit> . our results in figure 2c lend moderate support to this finding: a higher her <dig> expression level leads to a slightly higher her <dig> activation upon egf stimulation. however, since her <dig> activation is minimal in egf stimulated hme cells even when her <dig> expression level is high, the coupling between the egfr and her <dig> activation is very weak in hme cells. it should be noted that, compared to her2+/3+ cells, the her <dig> expression in her2-/3+ is very low but this cell line still expresses her <dig> . albeit at a low level, this small amount of her <dig> can still lead to her <dig> phosphorylation when the system is stimulated with hrg .

receptor interactions and transactivation patterns
one of our main aims was to determine which of the existing ideas about the interaction mechanisms between the her receptors  was valid in hme cells. our results  show that, with the exception of a low level her <dig> activation upon egf stimulation, the activation of egfr and her <dig> with their respective ligands does not strongly transactivate the other receptor. her <dig> is activated at a low level following egf addition, and this level of activation is slightly enhanced in the presence of her <dig> . these observations lead us to conclude that diagram a in figure  <dig> is not valid for hme cells. the lateral information transfer between egfr and her <dig> through her <dig> suggested by figure 1b does occur at a low level in our system but it is not a major contributor to receptor activation. as both egfr and her <dig> are robustly activated by their own ligands, and a strong phosphorylation of her <dig> is observed under all stimulus combinations, diagram 1c is the dominant interaction mechanism between her receptors in hme cells. figure  <dig> summarizes the observed interaction patterns in hme cells. we note that transactivation suggested by diagram 1b occurs in a uni-directional fashion in our system: the presence of her <dig> leads to an increase in her <dig> phosphorylation when cells are activated with egf. in contrast, egfr phosphorylation in response to hrg is almost non-existent irrespective of the her <dig> expression level . kim et al. observed that egf stimulates her <dig> phosphorylation in cos <dig> cells  <cit> . tzahar et al. have observed that egfr coimmunoprecipitates with ndf-activated her <dig> in various human tumor cell lines, but the egfr-her <dig> complex was undetectable when cells were stimulated with egf  <cit> . in these studies, activation with egf led to very low levels of her <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> . the differences in egfr-her <dig> transactivation between these previous studies and ours further highlight the cell line dependence of her interactions, and emphasize the need for a systematic investigation of her expression and its consequences in a common cellular background.

to test whether the lack of observed direct interaction between egfr and her <dig> was due to the strength of the stimuli, we have repeated the experiments using saturating dosages of egf  and hrg . these additional experiments with the her2-/3+ cells produced phosphorylation patterns that were similar to the lower ligand doses , thus supporting our conclusions.

data reported in figure  <dig> were collected using cultured cells that were grown to full confluency . to test whether cell confluency has an effect on the observed interaction patterns, we repeated some of the experiments using cells grown to 50% confluency. even though receptor phosphorylation levels are slightly lower in cells grown to half confluency, we find that the transactivation patterns and overall phosphorylation of the egfr and her <dig> receptors are very similar across the clones at full and half confluencies . thus, cell density does not have a noticeable impact on the her receptor interaction patterns in hme cells.

we note that our current experiments cannot explain the detailed mechanism of the interactions in diagram 1b, i.e., whether her <dig> performs its intermediary role by forming multimeric complexes, or by undergoing two distinct dimerization steps -- first with the egfr, then with her <dig>  the former might be applicable to receptor co-localization in lipid rafts  <cit> . the latter, where a receptor dissociates from a dimer and then forms a secondary dimer with a different receptor type, has also been suggested as a possible mechanism for lateral information transfer  <cit> . whatever the mechanism, we again emphasize that this type of interaction does not seem to play a significant role in hme cells.

effects of her <dig> dimerization inhibition on receptor activation
our results shown above and previous studies have clearly illustrated her2's central role in modulating her signaling. to further investigate the interaction patterns in this receptor family, and to test the validity of the interaction diagram presented in figure  <dig>  we used the anti-cancer antibody 2c <dig>  to selectively disrupt the ability of her <dig> to form dimers. the monoclonal antibody 2c <dig> is considered to be a general inhibitor of her <dig> dimerization because of its ability to bind to the her dimerization surface  <cit> . since her2+/3+ cells express all three receptors, we concentrated on this cell line, and used the her2+/3- and her2-/3+ cell lines as needed in these validation studies. we predict from our interaction diagram  that 2c <dig> would significantly lower her <dig> phosphorylation under all stimulus conditions. we also expect that egfr phosphorylation will be partially inhibited in the her <dig> expressing cell lines because only the heterodimers with her <dig> and not the egfr homodimers will be blocked. when her <dig> expression is too low to play a prominent role , egfr phosphorylation should be left unaffected by 2c <dig>  in contrast, as her <dig> mainly forms heterodimers with her <dig>  its phosphorylation should be significantly decreased in all cases.

our validation results with the 2c <dig> antibody are in agreement with these predictions. as predicted, when her <dig> is present, 2c <dig> only partially decreases egfr phosphorylation , while egfr phosphorylation is not reduced when her <dig> is absent . robust egfr phosphorylation in the parental her2-/3- cells  and the moderate decrease in egfr phosphorylation in the her <dig> expressing cell line upon 2c <dig> inhibition  indicate that egfr homodimers are a major component of egfr signaling. although we observe a significant amount of residual phosphorylation in all cases, her <dig> phosphorylation was largely  inhibited by 2c <dig> in all the cases tested . we also found that 2c <dig> decreases her <dig> phosphorylation almost down to the detection limit level , regardless of the her <dig> expression level . this observation indicates that ligand-induced her <dig> activation occurs solely through the formation of her2-her <dig> dimers.

to further investigate the role of her2-mediated interactions, we used another her <dig> blocking antibody, herceptin  <cit>  in our her2+/3+ cells. like 2c <dig>  4d5/herceptin also inhibits her <dig> dimerization but in a selective fashion; it disrupts the interaction between egfr and her <dig> but does not markedly interfere with the her2-her <dig> interaction  <cit> . this is most likely due to the differential involvement of her <dig> cell surface residues in the formation of the various dimer types  <cit> . since in our derived interaction diagram  her <dig> activation occurs primarily through her2-her <dig> dimerization, we predict that herceptin should not significantly affect her <dig> phosphorylation when her <dig> is activated with hrg. we also predict that herceptin would block her <dig> phosphorylation in response to egf, while minimally affecting her <dig> activation in response to hrg. further, as in the 2c <dig> case, we expect egfr phosphorylation to be partially inhibited because only the heterodimers with her <dig> will be blocked, and not the egfr homodimers.

our results for egfr and her <dig> phosphorylation in the presence of herceptin matched the above predictions . most importantly, we found that herceptin did not have a significant effect on her <dig> phosphorylation in response to hrg, and to the combined addition of egf and hrg in the her2+/3+ cells . these observations lend further support to our conceptual model for her interactions.

the effect of inhibiting her <dig> dimerization on her <dig> activation in response to egf is also presented in figure 6c and figure  <dig>  and this data can be used to validate the role of her <dig> in egfr-mediated her <dig> transactivation. based on our interaction diagram , we predict that blocking her <dig> should diminish her <dig> phosphorylation in response to egf. although the her <dig> transactivation is low to begin with, inhibiting her <dig> dimerization with either 2c <dig>  or herceptin  induces a further decrease in the her <dig> activation levels in response to egf. this confirms the derived role of her <dig> in egfr-mediated her <dig> transactivation in hme cells.

downstream signaling in response to her activation
we have also investigated the activation patterns of erk and akt in hme cells, which are the primary downstream effectors of the her family  <cit> . to characterize the ability of the various her receptors to activate erk and akt we assayed the phosphorylation of these signaling molecules in our clones, which have distinct her expression profiles.

her <dig> is believed to contribute to pro-survival signaling through akt activation  <cit> . therefore, as expected, akt activation  correlates well with her <dig> phosphorylation in our hme cell lines. we observed a strong akt response when her <dig> was activated by hrg. in contrast, activation of egfr with egf leads to a lower akt response . a similar pattern has been observed in the mcf- <dig> cells  <cit> . however, somewhat surprisingly, akt was activated at comparable levels in her2-/3+ and her2+/3+ cell lines in response to hrg  even though her <dig> phosphorylation levels differed by ~ <dig> fold in these two cells . thus, our results indicate that even a low her <dig> activation level might be enough to saturate akt signaling in hme cells. as her <dig> signaling mainly occurs through her2-her <dig> dimers , this observation emphasizes the strong potency of this dimer in pro-survival processes. further, this potency of the her2-her <dig> dimer could explain why her <dig> phosphorylation is refractory to tyrosine kinase inhibitors that do not completely silence her <dig>  <cit> .

erk activation was investigated in parallel studies . stimulation of the hme cell lines with either egf or hrg led to immediate robust erk activation. comparison of the results for the +hrg and +egf treatments shows that erk is more strongly activated by the egfr pathway than the her <dig> pathway. this is opposite of the trend observed in the mcf- <dig> cells  <cit> . this however could be due to the unequal egfr and her <dig> expressions and/or due to the mismatch in the activating ligand concentrations between the studies, which further supports our contention that cellular signaling studies have to be pursued in a context dependent manner. studies have also shown that the erk pathway can be regulated by pi3k/akt signaling using different mechanisms. depending upon the cell type, on the identity of the agonist and the ligand concentration, the akt upstream signaling protein pi3k may partially contribute to mek-dependent erk activation  <cit> . akt itself can also inhibit the erk pathway through its effect on raf activation  <cit> . comparison of the +egf and +egf+hrg stimulation conditions for the her <dig> expressing cells her2-/3+ and her2+/3+ shows that erk activation does not decrease even though akt activation is enhanced ~ <dig> fold . thus, substantial crosstalk between erk and akt pathways is not apparent in our hme cells.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
this study reports our results for the receptor activation profiles in a library of hme cells which express her <dig> and her <dig> receptors at different levels and egfr/her <dig> at an endogenous level. the ability to monitor receptor activation patterns in closely related cell lines has significant advantages. most importantly, this type of systematic study avoids the ambiguity associated with the interpretation of results collected in different cell lines. as different cell lines may not have the same basic cellular machinery , the dynamics of biomolecular processes can show strong cell line dependence. this is evidenced by the contradictory results that often appear in the literature. further, even large scale cellular phenotypic responses can be different in different cell types. the clone cell library developed in our group provided the means to systematically and quantitatively study the effects of the her receptor expression profile on signaling patterns in mammary epithelial cells. the library that we have constructed starting with the 184a <dig> strain of hme cells is physiologically relevant for understanding epithelial cell function because it retains the egfr-dependent regulatory machinery needed for proper proliferation and migration. our results reveal that our hme cell library recapitulates several known features of the her system, lending further evidence to its physiological relevance.

we used measurements of the receptor activation patterns in our cell line library to elucidate the her interaction hierarchy, which is difficult to directly quantify. although it is possible to use techniques such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer  or co-immunoprecipitation  to obtain the relative levels of various dimers, each of these techniques has drawbacks that complicate their interpretation particularly when quantification is desired. fret requires the use of fluorescent probes or antibodies that could alter the native conformational properties of the receptors. with co-ip, the pull down efficiencies could be different for the different her dimer complexes, and transient dimer interactions that result in receptor activation could be missed. since receptor interactions are required for the activation of the her molecules, receptor activation patterns represent a convenient readout to establish the interaction hierarchy. however, as evidenced in our discussion of figures  <dig> and  <dig>  establishing this link requires careful reasoning because the receptor activation pattern is a complex function of the number of available receptors, the dimerization affinities and stimulus conditions.

in this study we have tested various existing hypotheses about the interactions between her receptor types in hme cells. we found that, although her <dig> is a preferred dimerization partner for both egfr and her <dig>  it couples the egfr and her <dig> paths only weakly. these results invalidate the hypothesis that her <dig> acts as a lateral information carrier between egfr and her <dig> receptor, a feature that has been observed in some other cell lines. our analysis reveals that the dominant role of her <dig> in hme cells is to amplify egfr and her <dig> signals separately. based on our observations, we have constructed a conceptual model for her interactions in hme cells and then validated our model using the her <dig> dimerization blocking antibodies 2c <dig> and herceptin.

our observations and the constructed conceptual model for her receptor mediated signaling in hme cells can be useful in several ways. conceptual models provide the starting network topology for detailed mechanistic models. almost all of the existing mechanistic models for the her family of receptors include egfr-her <dig> dimerization and transactivation . depending on the parameter values, the egfr-her <dig> heterodimer may even play a major role in cellular signaling in these models. however, our experimental results have shown that egfr and her <dig> may only weakly affect each other. thus, a more correct model would exclude the egfr-her <dig> dimerization possibility, at least for our hme cells. our study clearly allows us to reach relevant conclusions about the network structures necessary for mathematical model building efforts. another key bottleneck in model building is the lack of consistent, good quality quantitative data for parameter estimation. we have recently shown that extracting kinetic parameters out of the experimental data is not straightforward, and a model-based analysis of such datasets can be a powerful tool for establishing the mechanistic details of the underlying biochemical network for reasonable sized systems  <cit> . chen et al. have recently pursued a similar but much more ambitious study  <cit> . unfortunately these model building efforts still mix-and-merge kinetic information from multiple studies performed for different cell types under different treatment conditions. our clone cell library provides us with the ability to generate consistent experimental datasets for mathematical modeling, thereby enabling the quantitative system wide investigation of the critical her receptor system.

in addition to the interactions between her members, we have also investigated two signaling pathways that are directly activated by her receptors, the akt and erk signaling pathways, to study the relationship between her receptor activation and downstream cellular signaling. we found that, even though the her <dig> pathway's contribution was comparatively weaker, erk activation can occur in response to both egf and hrg stimulation. our results established her <dig> as the main contributor to pro-survival akt signaling in hme cells. we observed that her <dig> activation with hrg is a strong activator of akt and that even low levels of her <dig> mediated signaling might be saturating akt in hme cells. this could be an indicator for the limited capacity of the akt pathway, and have other implications. even though egf induces low levels of akt activation, we found that the combined addition of egf and hrg results in a slight decrease in akt activation compared to the addition of hrg alone . since egfr and her <dig> can activate pi3k/akt through different recruitment paths  <cit> , when they compete for the limited pi3k/akt signaling capacity, the amount of akt phosphorylation reflects the balance between the relative contributions of the egfr  and her <dig>  pathways. which receptor ends up controlling akt activation in a particular cell would depend upon its receptor expression profile and stimulation condition. given that there is only a weak crosstalk between egfr and her <dig> at the receptor activation level, selectively inhibiting egfr or her <dig> depending upon which route dominates akt activation could prove to be an effective therapeutic strategy. as we have shown with examples here, results reported in this study can be used to develop and validate new hypothesis about the dynamics of the her family of receptors and the downstream pathways that they activate.
