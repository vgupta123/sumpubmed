BACKGROUND
denitrification is the respiratory reduction of nitrate or nitrite to the gaseous products nitric oxide , nitrous oxide , or dinitrogen . n2o is a powerful greenhouse gas  that has a 300-fold greater global warming potential than co <dig> based on its radiative capacity and could persist for up to 150 years in the atmosphere . in bacteria, the denitrification process requires four separate enzymatically catalysed reactions. the first reaction in denitrification is the reduction of nitrate to nitrite, which is catalysed by a membrane-bound nitrate reductase  or a periplasmic nitrate reductase  . in denitrifying bacteria, the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide is catalysed by two types of respiratory nir: the nirs cd <dig> nitrite reductase, a homodimeric enzyme with haems c and d <dig>  and nirk, a copper-containing nir  <cit> . then, nitric oxide is reduced to nitrous oxide by three types of nitric oxide reductase , which are classified based on the nature of their electron donor as cnor, qnor or qcuanor . the final step in denitrification consists of the two-electron reduction of nitrous oxide to dinitrogen gas. this reaction is performed by nitrous oxide reductase , a copper-containing homodimeric soluble protein located in the periplasmic space . bacteria of the order rhizobiales, collectively referred to as rhizobia, are best known for their ability to establish n2-fixing symbiosis on legume roots and on the stems of some aquatic leguminous plants. in addition to fixing n <dig>  many rhizobia species have enzyme-encoding genes for some or all of the four reductase reactions in denitrification. several studies have reported that legume crops contribute to n2o production by providing n-rich residues for decomposition  <cit>  and by associating with some rhizobia that are able to denitrify under free-living and under symbiotic conditions, producing n2o  <cit> . however, soybean endosymbiont bradyrhizobium japonicum is the only rhizobia species for which it has been demonstrated that the napedabc, nirk, norcbqd and nosrzdyflx genes are involved in complete denitrification  <cit> .

ensifer  meliloti is a rhizobial species that establishes symbiotic n2-fixing associations with plants of the genera medicago, melilotus and trigonella. genes for the complete denitrification pathway are present in the e. meliloti psyma megaplasmid  <cit> . transcriptomic analyses have shown that the e. meliloti nap, nir, nor and nos genes are induced in response to o <dig> limitation  <cit> . under these conditions, the expression of denitrification genes is coordinated via a two-component regulatory system, fixlj, and via a transcriptional regulator, fixk  <cit> . recent transcriptomic studies demonstrated that denitrification genes  and other genes related to denitrification  are also induced in response to no and that the regulatory protein nnrr is involved in the control of this process  <cit> . in symbiotic association with m. truncatula plants, recent findings have demonstrated that the e. meliloti napa and nirk denitrification genes contribute to nitric oxide production in root nodules  <cit> . although the regulation and symbiotic characterisation of e. meliloti denitrification genes is well understood, the roles of these genes in nitrate reduction through denitrification and in the emission of n2o are not known.

recent results from our group  <cit>  reported the capability of e. meliloti to use nitrate or nitrite as respiratory substrates when cells were incubated with an initial oxygen concentration of 2%; however, nitrate and nitrite could not be used as respiratory substrates when the cells were initially incubated anoxically. in the present work, functional analyses of the e. meliloti napa, nirk, norc and nosz genes reveal their involvement in the ability of e. meliloti to grow using nitrate as a respiratory substrate and in the expression of denitrification enzymes.

RESULTS
nitrate-dependent growth of e. meliloti napa, nirk, norc and nosz mutants
to investigate the involvement of denitrification genes in the ability of e. meliloti to grow using nitrate as an electron acceptor, the wild-type strains  <dig> and  <dig> and napa, nirk, norc and nosz mutant strains  were incubated in minimal medium  supplemented with 10 mm kno <dig>  with an initial o <dig> concentration of 2%, and the growth was determined by monitoring the optical density at 600 nm  . under these conditions, e. meliloti  <dig> cells consumed the oxygen present in the atmosphere after incubation for 6 h and reached anoxic conditions . similar oxygen consumption rates were observed for strain  <dig> and the napa, nirk, norc and nosz mutants . confirming the previous results  <cit> , e. meliloti  <dig> exhibited a cell density of approximately  <dig> after 48 h of incubation in mmn . a similar growth rate was observed after incubation of the wild-type strain  <dig> . as shown in figure 1a, the napa, nirk and norc mutant strains exhibited growth defects compared with the wt cells, reaching a turbidity of approximately  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, after incubation in mmn for 48 h . e. meliloti nosz mutant cells demonstrated similar growth to wt cells , suggesting that nosz was not essential for growth under these conditions. as previously reported for e. meliloti  <dig>  <cit> , none of the e. meliloti denitrification mutants were able to grow in mmn when they were subjected to anoxic conditions starting at the beginning of the incubation period . as shown in figure 1b, after incubation in mmn with an initial o <dig> concentration of 2%, nitrite was not observed in the growth medium of napa. however, in the nirk mutant, the nitrite concentration increased over the course of the incubation period, reaching a final concentration of  <dig>  mm. the wt strains demonstrated a similar rate of nitrite accumulation during the first 48 h; however, this nitrite was depleted over the subsequent 70 h of incubation .

the functions of the e. meliloti denitrification genes were also investigated by analysing the activities of the denitrification enzymes in wt and napa, nirk, norc and nosz mutants incubated under oxygen-limiting conditions. cells of the napa mutant demonstrated an approximately 11-fold decrease in methyl viologen-dependent nitrate reductase  activity compared with the wt cells after incubation for 18 h in mmn with an initial o <dig> concentration of 2% . as observed for the nr activity in napa cells, the methyl viologen-dependent nitrite reductase  activity levels in the nirk mutant cells were 10-fold lower than the levels detected in the parental strain when the cells were incubated in mmn with an initial o <dig> concentration of 2% . as shown in table  <dig>  the mv+-nr and mv+-nir activities were detected in wt cells incubated under anoxic conditions from the start of the incubation period. under these conditions, the nr activity levels in napa cells and the nir activity levels in nirk cells were undetectable .

we also investigated the ability of the e. meliloti nirk and norc mutants to produce nitric oxide. after incubation for 18 h with an initial o <dig> concentration of 2%, no production rates were determined in an no-electrode chamber after adding nitrite to the reaction mixture. a significant decrease in no production was observed in the nirk mutant compared with the wt strain , whereas the norc mutant produced  <dig> -fold more no than the wt cells . the high levels of no produced by the norc mutant are most likely due to its defect in no consumption activity. after 18 h of incubation in mmn under an initial o <dig> concentration of 2%, the norc mutant cells demonstrated no consumption activity that was practically abolished compared with the activity of wt cells ; the same results were observed when the norc mutant cells were incubated under initially anoxic conditions.

figure  <dig> shows that e. meliloti  <dig> is able to produce n2o after incubation in mmn under an initial o <dig> concentration of 2% and under anoxic conditions. under both conditions, the nosz mutant cells achieved n2o accumulation values of approximately 8- and 2-fold higher than the values produced by wt cells after 18 h and 36 h of incubation in mmn, respectively .

identification of e. meliloti norc
as previously reported by torres and colleagues  <cit> , four haem-stained bands of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 27 kda were detected in e. meliloti  <dig> cells grown in minimal media  with an initial o <dig> concentration of 2% in the headspace . although the identities of the 40 kda and 33 kda proteins are unknown, the 32 kda and 27 kda c-type cytochromes were identified as the e. meliloti fixp and fixo proteins, respectively, which are subunits of the cbb3-type high-affinity cytochrome c oxidase encoded by the fixnoqp operon  <cit> . the addition of nitrate to the growth medium revealed a haem-stainable band of approximately 16 kda in the membranes of the wt cells . this protein was absent in the norc mutant when it was incubated with a 2% initial oxygen concentration in mmn , which identifies this c-type cytochrome as the norc component of the e. meliloti  <dig> nitric oxide reductase. as shown in figure  <dig> , membranes from the napc mutant presented a similar band pattern to that of membranes from the wt cells incubated under an initial o <dig> concentration of 2% with nitrate . these results did not permit us to identify the e. meliloti napc protein, which has a predicted size of 25 kda. in contrast, in other rhizobia species, such as b. japonicum, napc has been detected via haem-staining analyses and identified as a protein approximately 25 kda in size  <cit> .

when the cells were subjected to anoxic conditions starting at the beginning of the incubation period, a strong defect in fixp and fixo expression was observed compared with the expression levels detected in cells incubated with an initial o <dig> concentration of 2% . only proteins approximately  <dig> and 33 kda in size could be detected in the anoxically incubated cells. these 40 kda and 33 kda proteins were also present in cells grown under oxic conditions  <cit> . these proteins might remain in the membranes of cells that are grown aerobically prior to the anoxic incubation period. as shown in figure  <dig> , nitrate-dependent norc expression decreased under anoxic conditions compared with cells incubated with an initial o <dig> concentration of 2%. as observed for norc, the expression of fixp and fixo was weak in the membranes from the anoxically incubated cells in the presence of nitrate .

expression of e. meliloti denitrification genes
we analysed the expression of the e. meliloti napa, nirk, norc and nosz genes using qrt-pcr analyses. with the exception of nirk expression, which was induced 36-fold by nitrate, the presence of nitrate in the growth medium of cells incubated under an initial o <dig> concentration of 2% provoked the induction of napa, norc and nosz expression by  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively, compared with the expression observed in the absence of nitrate . when the cells were incubated anoxically from the beginning of culture, the napa, nirk, norc and nosz genes were induced approximately 4-, 48-, 84- and 32-fold by nitrate compared with the expression levels observed after a 12 h incubation in mm at an initial o <dig> concentration of 2% . these results indicate that the maximal expression of the e. meliloti napa, nirk, norc and nosz denitrification genes occurs when the cells are initially incubated anoxically and when nitrate is present in the growth medium.

discussion
e. meliloti has been considered a partial denitrifier because of its traditionally reported inability to use nitrate as an electron acceptor for atp generation and growth under anoxic conditions  <cit> . recent results from our group confirmed the inability of e. meliloti to grow via nitrate respiration when cells were initially incubated under anoxic conditions  <cit> ; however, e. meliloti  <dig> was able to use nitrate as a respiratory substrate when cells were initially incubated with 2% o <dig> in the headspace  <cit> . under these conditions, o <dig> was consumed after 6 h of incubation, as we demonstrated in the present manuscript. in this work, we demonstrated that e. meliloti nap genes are involved in e. meliloti nitrate-dependent growth and that nitrite derived from nitrate reduction is produced by nap. the low levels of nr activity observed in the napa mutant explain the growth defect and the inability of this strain to produce nitrite in cells incubated in mmn with 2% initial o <dig>  the majority of the most well-characterised denitrifying bacteria use the membrane-bound nitrate reductase  to catalyse the first step of denitrification. in contrast to nar, which has a respiratory function, nap systems demonstrate a range of physiological functions, including the disposal of reducing equivalents during aerobic growth on reduced carbon substrates or anaerobic nitrate respiration  <cit> . our results support the proposed role of nap in nitrate respiration. some rhizobial species, such as pseudomonas sp. g <dig>  and bradyrhizobium japonicum, could express nap genes under anaerobic conditions, and the disruption of these genes is lethal for growth under denitrifying conditions  <cit> .

whereas the deletion of nosz did not have a significant effect on the ability of e. meliloti to respire nitrate and increase growth yield, the nirk and norc mutants exhibited clear defects in nitrate-dependent growth, most likely because of the toxicity of the intermediates nitrite and nitric oxide, respectively. nitrite or no were accumulated by the nirk and norc mutants, respectively, because of the strong defects in nir and nor activities observed in these mutants compared with wt levels. similar phenotypes for nirk and norc mutants were reported for b. japonicum <cit>  and rhizobium etli <cit> . the increased levels of n2o accumulated by the nosz mutant relative to the wt cells indicated that this gene is involved in nitrous oxide reduction in e. meliloti. similar observations were noted with a b. japonicum nosz mutant  <cit> . in addition to demonstrate the involvement of the e. meliloti napa, nirk, norc and nosz genes in nitrate, nitrite, nitric oxide and nitrous oxide reduction, respectively, we have identified the norc subunit of nitric oxide reductase as a cytochrome c that is approximately 16 kda in size.

growth experiments in this study and in previous studies  <cit>  clearly demonstrated that e. meliloti utilises nitrate-dependent growth when transitioning to anoxic conditions occurs when cells are incubated under an initial o <dig> concentration of 2%; however, nitrate-dependent growth does not occur when cells are subjected to anoxic conditions starting at the beginning of the incubation period. to understand the differential responses of e. meliloti denitrification capability to these different anoxically induced conditions, we investigated the ability of e. meliloti to express the denitrification genes in cells incubated under 2% initial o <dig> compared with cells initially subjected to anoxic conditions. despite the inability of e. meliloti to grow, we demonstrated that the napa, nirk, norc and nosz denitrification genes were fully induced in cells initially subjected to anoxia and in the presence of nitrate. furthermore, denitrification enzymes are active in cells initially incubated under anoxic conditions; we were able to detect significant mv+-nr, mv+-nir and nor activity levels and n2o production under these conditions. in contrast, the protein levels corresponding to norc and the fixp and fixo components of the high affinity cbb <dig> oxidase were very weak after incubation of the cells under anoxic conditions starting at the beginning of the incubation period. the latter observations might explain the limited nitrate-dependent growth capacity of e. meliloti when anoxic conditions are induced starting at the beginning of the growth period. under these conditions, cells would be trapped, without energy, and they would be unable to produce the proteins required to cope with the oxygen-limiting conditions, most likely because of the lack of energy. supporting this hypothesis, it was reported in pseudomonas sp. g <dig> that the formation of nitrate reductase and nitrous oxide reductase did not occur under aerobic or anaerobic conditions; however, nitrate reductase and nitrous oxide reductase were produced under microaerobic incubation  <cit> . the latter study suggests that dependence on microaerobiosis for the formation of these reductases was attributable to an inability to produce energy anaerobically until these anaerobic respiratory enzymes formed  <cit> . recent studies have shown that the soil bacterium agrobacterium tumefaciens is unable to maintain balanced expression of denitrification genes if oxygen depletion occurs too quickly  <cit> . similarly, the soil bacterium p. denitrificans appears unable to effectively switch from oxic to anoxic respiration, leaving a large fraction of the cell population in anoxia without a chance to express the denitrification proteome  <cit> . as suggested by nadeem and co-workers  <cit> , “microaerobic” denitrification is an essential trait for securing an efficient transition to anaerobic denitrification. considering that b. japonicum, which is able to grow under anoxic nitrate-respiring conditions, is a slow-growth bacterium and e. meliloti is a fast-growth bacterium, the transition from oxic to anoxic metabolism might be different in these species. supporting this suggestion, we observed that b. japonicum cells are able to express the fixo and fixp subunits of the cbb <dig> oxidase under anoxic conditions . however, as shown in this work, e. meliloti does not express the fixo and fixp proteins under anoxic conditions. a lack of the energy necessary for protein synthesis might contribute to the inability of e. meliloti to grow via nitrate respiration when cells are initially incubated anoxically.

CONCLUSIONS
the potential impact of denitrification by plant endosymbiotic bacteria on the emission of the greenhouse gas n2o has been poorly investigated. the results of this work demonstrate the involvement of the napa, nirk, norc and nosz genes in the previously reported ability of e. meliloti to grow via nitrate respiration when cells are subjected initially to 2% o <dig>  furthermore, the roles of the reductases encoded by napa, nirk, norc and nosz in nitrite, nitric oxide, n2o production and n2o reduction, respectively, were demonstrated. thus, our results contribute to the investigation of the unexplored genetic basis for denitrification in the alfalfa endosymbiont e. meliloti. this knowledge will be instrumental in the development of agricultural strategies and management practices for mitigating the release of n2o from legume crops.
