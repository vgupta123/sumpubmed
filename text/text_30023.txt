BACKGROUND
mycoplasmas belong to the class mollicutes, which is a taxon of bacteria that is characterized by the absence of a cell wall, a relatively small genome size and a strong dependence on nutrients supplied by the host environment  <cit> . more than  <dig> mycoplasma species have been described, and although they display diverse life styles, most of the species are parasitic, implying the occurrence of different mechanisms by which they interact with host cells. several mycoplasmas associate with their host cells through adhesins, while others may also invade cells  <cit> . among mycoplasmas, several species are responsible for human, animal and plant diseases, but some species are considered commensal organisms  <cit> .

mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, mycoplasma flocculare and mycoplasma hyorhinis are the most important species that have been identified in porcine respiratory systems  <cit> . based on a 16s rrna sequence comparison, m. hyopneumoniae and m. flocculare are known to be closely related  <cit> . m. hyopneumoniae is the etiological agent of porcine mycoplasmal pneumonia, while m. hyorhinis, which causes polyserositis and arthritis, is also frequently found in swine respiratory tracts  <cit> . m. flocculare is also widespread in swine herds, but no disease has been associated with this species  <cit> . m. hyopneumoniae can adhere to the cilia of tracheal epithelial cells and causes damage. although m. flocculare can also adhere to cilia, no resulting damage has been observed, suggesting that m. hyopneumoniae and m. flocculare may possess different adhesins, facilitating the recognition of different receptor sites on the cilia  <cit> . additionally, while m. flocculare is restricted to the swine respiratory tract, m. hyopneumoniae and m. hyorhinis can also colonize other sites, such as cardiac or joint tissues  <cit> . these bacteria can even colonize different hosts; m. hyorhinis has been detected in human carcinoma tissues  <cit> . the genetic maps of m. flocculare atcc  <dig> and m. hyopneumoniae strain j have been compared, revealing that at least three chromosomal inversions have occurred since the divergence of both species  <cit> .

in recent years, the genomes of several mycoplasma species have been sequenced. the absence of several metabolic pathways, which was suggested by genetic and biochemical studies  <cit> , has been confirmed at the genome sequence level. among the swine-infecting mycoplasmas, the genomes of m. hyopneumoniae , m. hyorhinis  and mycoplasma suis  have been sequenced, facilitating the comparison of metabolic pathways and evidencing specific mechanisms that can be utilized to survive in different host environments  <cit> .

because the genome sequences of m. flocculare and m. hyopneumoniae strain  <dig> have now been completed, the current study presents a comprehensive comparison of the m. flocculare, m. hyopneumoniae and m. hyorhinis genomes. these three mycoplasma species can inhabit swine respiratory tracts. we have assessed the overall genome organizations including analyses of the open reading frame  clusters , inversions and rearrangements, and coding capacities, including analyses of encoded metabolic pathways and surface protein repertoires. potential mechanisms of interaction with host cells are evidenced, and their implications on pathogenicity are discussed. additionally, a phylogenomic approach using  <dig> mycoplasma genomes  was implemented to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the swine mycoplasma genomes, individual genes and/or portions of their genomes, including horizontal gene transfer analysis.

RESULTS
general genome features of m. flocculare and m. hyopneumoniae 7422
the m. flocculare and m. hyopneumoniae  <dig> genomes are composed of single, circular chromosomes of  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp with  <dig> % and  <dig> % gc contents, respectively. the m. flocculare genome, which by assembly remained with  <dig> gaps, contains  <dig> coding sequences , of which  <dig> have known functions and  <dig> are annotated as hypothetical. the m. hyopneumoniae  <dig> genome, completely closed in one contig by assembly, comprises  <dig> cdss, of which  <dig> correspond to proteins with known functions and  <dig> are annotated as hypothetical. the protein-coding regions occupy approximately 87% of each m. flocculare and m. hyopneumoniae  <dig> chromosome, and the average orf length is  <dig>  bp. each genome contains one gene encoding the ribosomal rnas  16s and 23s, one gene encoding rrna 5s and  <dig> genes encoding the transfer rnas  representing all  <dig> amino acids. the general genome features of the five strains, m. hyopneumoniae , m. flocculare, and m. hyorhinis hub- <dig>  were compared in this study and are listed in table  <dig> 

*abreviations: mhp = m. hyopneumoniae; mfl = m. flocculare; mhr = m. hyorhinis

among the m. flocculare and m. hyopneumoniae  <dig> cdss that encode proteins with known functions,  <dig> and  <dig> cdss, respectively, were classified into cog families comprising  <dig> functional categories . a functional classification based on the kegg  <cit>  analysis assigned  <dig> and  <dig> cdss from m. flocculare and m. hyopneumoniae  <dig>  respectively, into  <dig> different categories . the performance differences produced by cog with respect to kegg may be attributable to the presence of paralogs. as expected, the general genomic features and similarities in all of the cog and kegg categories were strikingly similar between m. flocculare, m. hyopneumoniae, and m. hyorhinis, which commonly exhibited small genome sizes, high at contents, and no two signal transduction proteins .

to identify the genes that constitute the core and pan-genome of m. flocculare, m. hyopneumoniae, and m. hyorhinis, we took advantage of the bidirectional best hit  approach and plotted the data in a venn diagram . we identified a considerable number of unique  genes in m. hyorhinis that may underline the phenotypic differences between this species and m. flocculare and m. hyopneumoniae. including the repertoire of surface proteins  and the inositol metabolism pathway, we identified  <dig> genes that are unique to m. flocculare,  <dig> to m. hyopneumoniae and  <dig> to m. hyorhinis.

when compared to other sequenced strains of m. hyopneumoniae, the genome of strain  <dig> displays a highly similar gene composition and organization, with the exception of the localization of the integrative conjugative element , which is positioned from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp in the  <dig> genome and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp in the  <dig> genome. the similarity between m. hyopneumoniae gene repertories was 88% approximately. the small, but significative difference in the m. hyopneumoniae  <dig> genome is the presence of an exclusive region of genes encoding transposases, hypothetical proteins and an ortholog of subtilisin-like serine protease . in comparison to  <dig> genome, just one exclusive region was found in the  <dig> genome, which is composed of genes encoding hypothetical proteins .

comparison of oc organization in m. flocculare, m. hyopneumoniae and m. hyorhinis genomes
the gene-by-gene genome organization of m. flocculare, m. hyopneumoniae  <dig> and m. hyorhinis hub- <dig> was analyzed, and the gene localization patterns were compared to detect orfs with order conservation. the orf cluster composition, organization and localization in the genomes were analyzed to determine the conservation level among the oc organization. two groups of orf clusters were created for each species, the oc group  and the monocistronic gene  group . the general features of the ocs organization in the m. flocculare, m. hyopneumoniae and m. hyorhinis genomes are shown in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig> 

* abbreviations as in table  <dig> 

a comparison of the ocs arrangements revealed a similar number of ocs among the m. flocculare, m. hyopneumoniae and m. hyorhinis genomes . this result suggests that gene organization in m. flocculare and m. hyorhinis also occur preferably in clusters as found in m. hyopneumoniae <cit> . moreover, as previously described for m. hyopneumoniae <cit> , the overall orf distribution within the ocs in m. flocculare and m. hyorhinis is highly variable with respect to the number of orfs and the functional categories of the encoded products .

an analysis of the mc group revealed a different orf number in the m. flocculare genome when compared to the organization in the m. hyopneumoniae and m. hyorhinis genomes. there were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mcs in the m. flocculare, m. hyopneumoniae and m. hyorhinis genomes, respectively . among all of the mcs, seventeen mcs were shared only by the m. flocculare and m. hyopneumoniae genomes. however, only the cdss encoding an o-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase  and an excinuclease abc subunit c  were found to display monocistronic organization in the three genomes .

a detailed analysis of the organization of each oc demonstrated a high level of conservation between the m. flocculare and m. hyopneumoniae genomes . approximately 78% and 46% of the ocs from m. flocculare display total or partial conserved gene distribution when compared to the ocs of m. hyopneumoniae and m. hyorhinis, respectively . moreover, a comparative analysis of oc cluster organization among the three mycoplasma species revealed the presence of  <dig> ocs with complete similarity with respect to the orf repertoires . the majority of these ocs  were composed of two orfs, with increasing numbers of up to five orfs. these data are consistent with previous results that suggested that the majority of gene clusters in diverse organisms are formed by a string of two to four genes  <cit> .

* abbreviations as in table  <dig> 

another group of noteworthy ocs was the group classified as partially conserved among the three mycoplasma species. the number of partially conserved gene-order clusters in different genome pairs is shown in table  <dig>  the m. flocculare and m. hyopneumoniae genomes shared  <dig> ocs in which the gene string was partially conserved, and  <dig> ocs of the  <dig> ocs were classified as partially conserved in all three analyzed species. it is well known that only a few operons are conserved in most bacterial genomes; the classical example of conserved organization involves the ribosomal protein operons  <cit> . however, a detailed analysis of the  <dig> partially conserved ocs revealed gene context conservation in the ribosomal operons  and in other clusters, such as clusters containing the chromosomal replication initiation protein   and the oc containing the cell division protein mraz . in general, the similarity of the gene order  among the prokaryotic genomes is maintained via the horizontal transfer of a chromosomal region. our results suggest that individual genome pairs, such as m. flocculare and m. hyopneumoniae or m. flocculare and m. hyorhinis, share several ocs, which can partially be attributed to horizontal gene transfer.

a detailed, genomic-scale analysis of the oc organization in m. flocculare and m. hyopneumoniae demonstrated that species-specific differences are not present in genes with known function and/or related with pathogenicity . apparently the  <dig> ocs exclusive to m. hyopneumoniae  encode hypothetical proteins, transport-related proteins, myo-inositol utilization proteins, the integrative conjugative element  and an additional copy of the p <dig> protein . in the m. hyorhinis genome,  <dig> ocs were unique to this species , and the majority of the orfs encode hypothetical proteins or products related to variable surface lipoproteins , which have been described as being involved in a complex system involving bacterial-host interactions  <cit> .

rearrangements in the m. flocculare, m. hyopneumoniae and m. hyorhinis genomes
a detailed comparative analysis of genome organization is needed to understand the evolutionary dynamics of prokaryotic genomes. therefore, a comparative genomic analysis was performed using the m. flocculare contigs  and m. hyopneumoniae genome, considering the orf string organization and oc distribution . comparisons were also performed between mfl contigs and the m. hyorhinis genome ; however, in this case, both the global alignment and gene-by-gene alignment were not applicable, possibly due to the large number of transpositions and inversions that have occurred in these genomes.

in the comparison between m. flocculare and m. hyopneumoniae,  <dig> regions  were identified as being involved in inversions or rearrangements . among these regions, only eight showed major rearrangements, although the oc organization was maintained. notably, ocs containing several of the genes encoding pathogenicity-related proteins, such as lipoproteins and adhesins, were located within these regions. for instance, major rearrangements were observed in gene clusters encoding p <dig>  p <dig> , p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> , p <dig>  p <dig>  and the 46 k surface antigen precursor . genes encoding transposases were found adjacent to some of the inverted segments, such as in mfl contig  <dig>  and mfl contig  <dig> , suggesting a possible role of these transposases in the rearrangements. our findings in the comparison between the m. flocculare and m. hyopneumoniae genomes are similar to the situation found in the genomes of the two closely related species mycoplasma pneumoniae and mycoplasma genitalium, whose genomes can be divided into segments with highly conserved gene organization, although the segments are arranged differently  <cit> .

the lack of gene-order conservation beyond the operon level even between relatively closely related species has been previously described  <cit> . apparently, in closely related mycoplasmas, such as m. flocculare and m. hyopneumoniae, large-scale gene-order conservation is observed, although genome collinearity is disrupted at some points. chromosomal rearrangements are generally caused by homologous recombination between repeated sequences within the genome  <cit> . although the number of genes involved in dna repair and recombination in mycoplasmas is relatively small  <cit> , the gene encoding reca was found in all sequenced mollicute genomes. recently, the importance of reca in the antigenic and phase variation of the mgpb and mgpc adhesins in m. genitalium has been demonstrated  <cit> .

repertoire of surface proteins encoded by m. flocculare, m. hyopneumoniae and m. hyorhinis
a comparative in silico survey of the repertoire of encoded surface proteins was performed between the genome of the non-pathogenic m. flocculare and the genomes of two pathogenic mycoplasma species that are found in this tissue in the swine respiratory tract, m. hyopneumoniae  and m. hyorhinis . the results of this survey are summarized in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  and the complete generated datasets are presented in additional files  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  of the total of 585 m. flocculare cdss,  <dig>  were predicted to encode surface proteins; this number was similar to that of m. hyopneumoniae  <dig>  and higher than that of m. hyorhinis hub- <dig> 

. the proportion of cdss encoding surface proteins in these species is considerably large considering their small genome sizes. from these surface protein sets,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  cdss are unique to m. flocculare, m. hyopneumoniae and m. hyorhinis, respectively, with respect to the other two species .

the repertoire of m. flocculare surface proteins that is not shared with the other two species consists exclusively of hypothetical proteins; although those of m. hyopneumoniae and m. hyorhinis are predominantly composed of hypothetical proteins , they also include some proteins with assigned functions. among these proteins with predicted functions, m. hyopneumoniae includes proteins involved in myo-inositol catabolism, a permease and a protein encoded by the integrative conjugative element , and m. hyorhinis includes some variable antigens, secretory system components, transporters and lipoproteins.

based on an e-value cutoff threshold of 1e- <dig> to define orthology, nearly 90% of the repertoire of m. flocculare surface proteins is shared with m. hyopneumoniae and/or m. hyorhinis . searches using more stringent conditions resulted in not more than a 20% reduction in the numbers of identified orthologs . these results are indicative of physiological similarities that would be consistent with the adaptation to the same host environment. of the shared proteins, approximately 40% have unknown functions , while the other 60% consist of proteins with assigned functions in at least one of the compared species. notably, many of these shared proteins  correspond to putative pathogenicity-related genes in m. hyopneumoniae and/or m. hyorhinis; these proteins include several lipoproteins and adhesins that are thought to play a role in virulence despite of the non-pathogenic nature of m. flocculare and the pathogenicity differences between m. hyopneumoniae and m. hyorhinis. for instance, m. flocculare contains orthologs for the p <dig> copy  <dig> and for the p97-like adhesins of m. hyopneumoniae, although it lacks an ortholog for p <dig> copy  <dig>  the genomic organization of the p <dig> copy  <dig> and p97-like ortholog cdss are similar in both species with respect to gene clustering ; this result suggests that p <dig> copy  <dig> and p97-like are ancestral p <dig> paralogs and that they were present in a common ancestor to m. flocculare and m. hyopneumoniae. a second duplication event, which originated the m. hyopneumoniae p <dig> copy  <dig>  would have occurred after the divergence of m. hyopneumoniae from m. flocculare.

additional file  <dig> lists some adhesins that have been associated with pathogenicity and have been experimentally analyzed  <cit>  in m. hyopneumoniae  <dig>  the m. hyopneumoniae  <dig> and m. flocculare genomes contain orthologs for all the adhesins with the aforementioned exception of one copy of the p <dig> and p <dig> proteins that are absent in m. flocculare . the gene organization and location was analyzed and, as described in additional file  <dig>  the regions containing these orthologs are involved in inversions or rearrangements  in both mycoplasma species. specifically, three important adhesins  display highly conserved gene organization between m. hyopneumoniae  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> strains, but they display inversions and rearrangements in m. flocculare. the participation of m. hyopneumoniae adhesins in host-cell adhesion is a complex process involving specific cleavage events  <cit> . the set of m. flocculare genes that may be involved in adhesion may not be complete, which would explain the differences in host-cell adhesion with respect to m. hyopneumoniae <cit> . these results may explain the presence of orthologs in m. flocculare despite its lack of pathogenic capacity.

the presence of surface virulence determinants even in the non-pathogenic m. flocculare and in a non-pathogenic strain of m. hyopneumoniae   <cit>  suggests that their roles in pathogenicity may depend on their expression levels and/or post-translational processing, which may vary  <cit> . differences in virulence between species and strains can also be associated with the presence of variants of these proteins with or without some functional domains that are associated with features such as adhesion capacity or antigenicity, which has previously been described for several m. hyopneumoniae and m. hyorhinis virulence factors  <cit> . for instance, the m. flocculare p <dig> copy  <dig> and p97-like orthologs present relatively high overall identities to their m. hyopneumoniae counterparts , but in the case of p <dig> copy  <dig>  the m. flocculare ortholog lacks a domain  regarded to be important for virulence in m. hyopneumoniae; instead, it contains a second r <dig> domain . these r <dig> and r <dig> repeats are absent from the m. flocculare p97-like protein and its orthologs from m. hyopneumoniae  and m. hyorhinis .

cell-surface features with implications for virulence may also reside in the  <dig> to 18% of the repertoires of surface proteins that are not shared between m. flocculare, m. hyopneumoniae and m. hyorhinis. however, because all  or most  of these unshared cds products are hypothetical or conserved hypothetical proteins, their potential contributions to pathogenicity remain elusive. however, considering the nature of the unshared cds products annotated in m. hyopneumoniae and m. hyorhinis, these ‘exclusive’ and unknown proteins are likely to include players of processes that are important for pathogen-host interactions, such as proteins involved in secretion, the uptake of certain molecules, conjugation and immune evasion/modulation. the variation in m. hyorhinis surface lipoproteins  is considered important to protect the organism from the humoral response and may be a primary adaptive strategy for immune evasion during infection and disease  <cit> . therefore, at least some of these proteins are expected to compose a portion of the repertoire of determinants of virulence or avirulence for each species or strain.

an additional comparison of the repertoires of surface proteins from m. flocculare, m. hyopneumoniae and m. hyorhinis was performed based on the cog classification of the predicted surface protein sets for each species . the produced cog functional profiles of surface proteins for the three species are summarized in additional file  <dig>  according to the cog, the functional surface protein profile for m. flocculare is similar to those for m. hyopneumoniae and m. hyorhinis; similar numbers of proteins were assigned to each category for the three species. this similarity was observed even for the u and m categories, which include secretion system components , and for the no-cog category, which included 45-53% of the proteins, most of which  were represented by hypothetical proteins or in the additional category of antigen, adhesin or lipoprotein, in which proteins were included based on their prior immunological or functional characterization according to published studies. overall, the surface protein set for m. flocculare, taken from the correspondent cog profile, was shown to be very similar to those of m. hyopneumoniae and m. hyorhinis. this result suggests that the species have equivalent genetic backgrounds for metabolic and growth processes. such functional similarities may be the result of common selective pressures associated with the colonization of the same environment .

the l  and v  categories displayed differences; m. flocculare  contained approximately half of the number of proteins as m. hyopneumoniae. protein sets assigned to the l category are heterogeneous, and the relative excess of proteins in m. hyopneumoniae corresponds to transposases that cannot be found in either m. flocculare or m. hyorhinis. conversely, category v is enriched with atp-binding cassette  transporter system proteins related to defense mechanisms, such as the m. hyorhinis abc-type multidrug-like transport system atp-binding proteins and their orthologs in m. flocculare and m. hyopneumoniae. the remaining transporters, including abc and non-abc transporter system components  appear in other cog categories, such as e, g, r or p. however, the overall number of transporters unrelated to defense mechanisms  is roughly equivalent in the three species, with  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  in the m. flocculare, m. hyopneumoniae and m. hyorhinis surface protein sets, respectively. although m. hyorhinis have  <dig> genes encoding transposases, and m. hyopneumoniae  <dig> genes, notably, the presence of transposases among m. hyopneumoniae predicted surface proteins may be an artifact due to the occurrence of helical structures in these enzymes  <cit> ; these helices can be misidentified as transmembrane domains. however, the differential presence of at least some transporter system components is indicative of certain m. hyopneumoniae capabilities that are unavailable in both m. flocculare and m. hyorhinis. a larger number of transport proteins is usually related to a species’ capacity to persist in different tissue environments  <cit> , but this phenomenon does not seem to apply to m. flocculare, m. hyopneumoniae or m. hyorhinis because they share a large portion of the transporter repertoire. this situation is similar to that observed for secretory system components. however, according to the cog , m. hyopneumoniae has approximately two-fold more transporters associated with defense mechanisms than the other two species. in this aspect, m. hyopneumoniae is more similar to mycoplasma bovis <cit> , which infects the respiratory tract and breast and joint tissues of bovines, than to m. flocculare or m. hyorhinis. the implications of the larger m. hyopneumoniae repertoire of defense mechanisms proteins  for its survival in the swine respiratory tract have not yet been investigated.

phylogenomics and the phylogenetics of mycoplasmatacae
from the entire set of  <dig> annotated m. flocculare genes,  <dig> gene sets were retrieved that contained at least one gene representative for each swine mycoplasma analyzed here . overall,  <dig> ortholog-like files representing different cdss were concatenated, leading to an aligned file containing  <dig>  amino acid residues. the neighbor-joining method  and maximum parsimony  tree topologies did not differ significantly, especially when major clades were considered . there was consensus in several aspects . as expected, all of the m. hyopneumoniae strains formed a monophyletic clade. additionally, the m. hyopneumoniae monophyletic clade was closely related to m. flocculare, with high bootstrap support. finally, m. hyorhinis is basal to mycoplasma conjunctivae, m. flocculare and m. hyopneumoniae in all of the phylogenomic trees.

the mycoplasmataceae species were subdivided into the following clades: bovis , hominis , hyopneumoniae , hemotrophic mycoplasma , genitalium-pneumoniae , and mycoides . all of these clades displayed high bootstrap values. the synoviae-pulmonis  group did not form a monophyletic cluster, but they are closely related to the bovis clade. m. penetrans hf- <dig> is near the genitalium-pneumoniae clade.

our mycoplasma phylogenomic tree  corroborated the results that were obtained using the rna polymerase beta subunit , 16s-23s rrna intergenic transcribed spacer region , and 16s rrna genes  <cit> . m. flocculare, m. hyopneumoniae  <dig>  and m. hyorhinis hub- <dig> were located in the hyopneumoniae clade.

when comparing the m. flocculare, m. hyorhinis hub- <dig> and m. hyopneumoniae  <dig> genomes, several paralog clusters were identified through the bidirectional best hit  approach, wherein a paralog cluster was defined as a gene set in which every gene is a bbh with at least one other element. fourteen of these paralogs  were submitted to phylogenetic analyses to understand the evolutionary history of those paralogs.

phylogenetic analyses of mycoplasma dna methylases, which are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a methyl group to dna  <cit> , contained ancient gene duplications in the hyopneumoniae group, leading each dna methylase paralog to form a monophyletic group that included m. flocculare and m. hyopneumoniae . methylation, in addition to involvement in restriction systems, plays an important role in controlling gene expression, and it is one of the most significant dna modifications  <cit> . the n6-adenine methylation is involved in bacterial gene regulation and virulence  <cit> . cpg motifs in bacterial dna may play a significant pathogenic role in inflammatory lung disease because the proinflammatory effects can be reduced by dna methylation  <cit> . microarray analyses and rt-pcr have demonstrated that the deletion of a c5-cytosine methyltransferase in helicobacter pylori strains can affect the expression of several genes related to motility, adhesion and virulence  <cit> .

the atp synthase phylogeny indicated that m. flocculare, m. hyorhinis hub- <dig>  and m. hyopneumoniae  <dig> cluster according to the atp synthase subunit, with the alpha subunit presenting a more complex evolutionary pattern . this enzyme is required to synthesize adenosine triphosphate , providing energy to the cell. the paralogs found in mycoplasmas are related to different subunits that are required for enzymatic function  <cit> .

ribulose-phosphate 3-epimerase interconverts the stereoisomers ribulose-5-phosphate and xylulose-5-phosphate  <cit> . its phylogeny revealed that ancient duplications occurred in the hyopneumoniae group. other gene duplications responsible for the m. hyorhinis gdl- <dig> and m. hyorhinis hub- <dig> split can be observed at the base of this m. hyorhinis clade . similarly, recent gene duplications can be observed in the m. hyorhinis clade in the oligoendopeptidase f  and single-strand binding protein  phylogenetic trees, which both contain high bootstrap support.

m. flocculare and m. hyopneumoniae  <dig> contain two copies of fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, while m. hyorhinis hub- <dig> contains only one copy. these duplications likely occurred prior to the diversification of the hyopneumoniae group . the same process occurred during dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase evolution, as shown in additional file  <dig>  m. hyorhinis hub- <dig> contains two copies of the dimeric glycolytic enzyme glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, which catalyzes the reversible isomerization of glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate  <cit> . the lack of statistical confidence in some tree branches did not facilitate inferences regarding the evolutionary history of these copies in m. hyorhinis hub- <dig> .

two lipoate-protein ligases are found in m. hyopneumoniae  <dig> and m. hyorhinis hub- <dig>  they are more closely related to the enzymes from other microorganisms than to each other . in m. flocculare, only one copy was identified. the same pattern was observed in the phylogenetic tree of acyl-carrier-protein phosphodiesterase , which belongs to the hydrolase family and acts on phosphoric diester bonds  <cit> . the topology of the lactate dehydrogenase tree showed that the two m. hyorhinis hub- <dig> protein copies are significantly different, which led the sequences to be grouped in distant clades . a recent duplication of membrane nuclease lipoprotein resulted in a m. hyorhinis cluster containing the two m. hyorhinis hub- <dig> copies. a unique copy of this specific protein was found in m. flocculare and m. hyopneumoniae  <dig> .

two copies of the trse -like protein were identified in m. hyopneumoniae  <dig>  and one copy was identified in the m. flocculare and m. hyorhinis hub- <dig> genomes. each copy is more similar to other sequences in the m. hyopneumoniae strain than to one another . finally, p <dig> is an adhesin thought to play a role in virulence. several copies have been detected in the hyopneumoniae group. the phylogenetic tree indicated that the copies of m. flocculare and m. hyopneumoniae  <dig> are more closely related to the sequences from other species and strains than to each other .

although mycoplasmas contain reduced genomes, some paralogs are maintained in their genomes. a phylogenetic analysis was conducted to better understand the evolution of those paralogs. gene copies are known to be preserved in a genome if the organism demands high levels of particular gene products. in other cases, positive selection can result in the diversification of the gene’s function, a process called neofunctionalization  <cit> . additionally, subfunctionalization can lead to the loss of function, resulting in duplicated genes whose functions differ to some degree  <cit> . even highly conserved genes may have slightly or very different functions, such as glycolytic enzymes such as fructose-bisphosphate aldolase , which have been described as complex, multifunctional proteins that perform non-glycolytic functions  <cit> .

some mycoplasma paralog proteins, such as lipoate- protein ligase may possess different functions or differ in substrate specificity. otherwise, essential enzymes, such as atp synthase, may maintain multiple gene copies because they encode different subunits that are required for enzymatic function, despite the recent finds of losses of this enzyme family in the common ancestor of mollicutes  <cit> . according to the standard model of phylogenomics, there is a higher similarity among orthologs than paralogs  <cit> . the paralog genes initially display identical sequences and functions. however, the action of selective pressures and mutations lead to divergence in regulatory and coding sequences  <cit> .

horizontal gene transfer
the species tree that was generated by the phylogenomic analysis was compared to the individual gene trees to investigate the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer  events. hgts are an important source of genome innovation and evolution in prokaryotes  <cit> , and it apparently also impacts mycoplasmataceae evolution.

in mycoplasmas, we observed several hgt events ; some of the events occurred between m. hyorhinis hub- <dig> and m. conjunctivae hrc. the events involving species belonging to the hyopneumoniae group occurred in ribosomal proteins, gtp-binding proteins, heat-shock proteins, dna primase, signal recognition particle protein, abc transporter atp-binding proteins, phosphoesterases, cell division protein, elongation factor, fructose-biphosphate aldolase, dna polymerase, glutamyl-trna synthetase, helicases, and hypothetical proteins. regions encoding abc transporters were likely transferred between m. synoviae and m. gallisepticum , corroborating previously published results  <cit> .

it is well-known that prokaryotes exchange genes in a sophisticated manner via lateral transfer, and bacterial phylogenies may also be viewed as a complex network of genomic exchange. however, the sequence-based methods implemented in the phylogenomic studies have yielded phylogenetic trees that are similar to rrna trees, which were demonstrated in the current study. consequently, lateral transfer events do not prevent the recovery of phylogenetic signals in prokaryotes, although they do add an extra source of noise  <cit> .

mycoplasmas contain a reduced genome; therefore, they lack many metabolic pathways, particularly biosynthetic pathways, such as those involved in cell-wall production, de novo purine biosynthesis and the biosynthesis of amino acids  <cit> . these organisms also lack a functional tricarboxylic acid  cycle because they are extremely fastidious in their nutritional requirements and dependent on nutrients supplied by their hosts. they produce high levels of enzymes responsible for the degradation of nucleic acids and proteins and transporters to obtain the precursors of these macromolecules. most mycoplasma species depend on the glycolytic pathway to generate atp. some species may produce atp based on the reaction involving acetyl phosphate and adp by acetate kinase, coupled with acetyl phosphate formation from acetyl-coa by phosphate acetyl transferase. acetyl coa is formed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex  <cit> . some mycoplasma species such as m. hominis and m. arthritidis produce atp through arginine degradation, using the arginine dihydrolase pathway  <cit> . this pathway is absent in the mycoplasma genomes analyzed in this work. all of the genes that encode enzymes of the glycolytic pathway exist in the three species; however, some differences in gene copy number were observed. two copies of the genes encoding fructose-bisphosphate aldolase exist in m. hyopneumoniae and m. flocculare, two copies of the gene encoding d-ribulose-5-phosphate  <dig> epimerase are present in m. hyopneumoniae, and two copies of the gene encoding glucose-6-phosphate isomerase are present in m. hyorhinis. the possible influence of the gene copy number on the physiology of the species is unknown. however, some glycolytic enzymes have been described as virulence factors, exhibiting functions unrelated to glycolysis, such as adhesion to the host cells, may contribute to the pathogenesis of mycoplasmas infections  <cit> . the evolutionary aspects of these paralogs are discussed in the “phylogenomics and phylogenetics of mycoplasmatacae” section.

it has been shown that nuclease activities can be detected in mollicutes and that these activities are primarily associated with the membrane and may be essential for growth and survival  <cit> . genes encoding nucleases or putative membrane-associated nucleases were found in the three analyzed mycoplasma species. two gene sets encoding membrane nucleases were observed in the three species. one set is represented by two copies of mnua  in the m. hyorhinis hub- <dig> genome and a single copy in m. hyopneumoniae  <dig> , m. hyopneumoniae  <dig>  and m. flocculare . another set represented by two copies was observed in the genomes of the three species. the cell surface-exposed exonuclease  from m. hyopneumoniae  <dig>  a representative of the latter set, has been analyzed, and it has been proposed that the exonuclease activity of mhp <dig> may be important for importing nucleic acid precursors  <cit> . the presence of an extra copy of a nuclease gene in m. hyorhinis may represent a potential advantage of this species in acquiring nucleic acids precursors. mycoplasmas cannot de novo synthesize purines and pyrimidines; therefore, they depend on salvage and interconversions to supply the cell with the nucleic acid precursors  <cit> . the three species contain a similar set of genes involved in purine  and pyrimidine  metabolism . however, m. hyorhinis contains genes encoding thymidylate synthetase , allowing the conversion of dump to dtmp, and dihydrofolate reductase , which catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate  to tetrahydrofolate . the presence of ts and dhfr in m. hyorhinis may also contribute to its ability to overgrow the other mycoplasma species in the swine respiratory tract  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the comparative analyses of three mycoplasma species that inhabit the swine respiratory tract facilitated the identification of some characteristics that may promote the understanding of their different behaviors. the m. hyopneumoniae strain  <dig> genome displays a similar organization as to the other previously described strains, but it contains rearrangements and an altered position of iceh in the genome. the genomes of m. hyopneumoniae and m. flocculare, two closely related species, contain some blocks of synteny, but they also display many differences that may help to explain why one species is pathogenic and the other is commensal. however, it was not possible to correlate specific virulence determinant factors to the pathogenicity differences of the analyzed species. a large proportion of the repertoire of m. flocculare surface proteins is shared with m. hyopneumoniae and/or m. hyorhinis, which would be expected because the organisms may occupy the same niche. however, certain members of the p <dig> family are absent in m. flocculare, and some display sequence differences or lack domains that are considered to be important for host-cell adhesion. m. hyorhinis contains some metabolic genes that are absent in the other species, suggesting a possible advantage in the growth of this species. the differences in some components involved in evasion of the host immune system may also contribute to the aggressive growth of m. hyorhinis. the phylogenomic analysis confirmed previous results, placing m. hyopneumoniae, m. flocculare and m. hyorhinis in the hyopneumoniae clade. several horizontal gene transfer events were identified, and several of them occurred between m. hyorhinis and m. conjunctivae.
