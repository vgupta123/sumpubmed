BACKGROUND
in recent years, numerous publications – over  <dig> pages of them in current listings of the bibliographic search engine medline – have detailed changes in biological systems and organisms that appear associated with the climatic changes commonly referred to as global warming . few studies, however, have documented long-term changes in the genetic structure of species populations on a regional scale, necessary for understanding the microevolutionary consequences of global change  <cit> . in the genus drosophila, comprised of over  <dig> species  <cit> , only four species have received such attention. while some long term increases have been documented in the frequencies of chromosomal gene arrangements standard , tree line , and pike's peak  in drosophila pseudoobscura in the western united states and canada over ca  <dig> years  <cit>  and of several arrangements in drosophila melanogaster in japan  <cit> , little is known of the causes for these changes.

orengo and prevosti  <cit>  first suggested that climatic warming was responsible for long-term temporal changes in the frequencies of certain gene arrangements in european populations of d. subobscura. later, rodriguez-trelles and co-workers  <cit>  and sole', et al.  <cit>  convincingly demonstrated that climatic changes, including global warming, were likely the driving force of microevolutionary changes in these populations.

recently, significant changes have also been documented in the chromosomal variation of d. robusta sturtevant, some of them possibly attributable to global warming  <cit> . here we describe additional data that underscore the variety of historical changes being experienced by populations of this species. clearly, the chromosomal polymorphisms in d. robusta are also dynamic, and when compared with the considerable geographical and experimental data available for this species collected over the last  <dig> years, strongly implicate regional climatic changes as a cause for these temporal frequency shifts.

RESULTS
regional patterns of climate change were revealed from ancova analysis of temperature and precipitation data from  <dig> –  <dig>  no long term tends were detected for precipitation except for a significant increase in central park, ny . significant long-term temperature changes were apparent at all six  <dig> study sites  for the three available temperature indicators: average monthly minimum temperature , average monthly temperature , and average maximum monthly temperature . avtemp and maxtmp varied significantly from site to site in different years, but mintmp significantly increased over the 58-year period  with no heterogeneity among sites. thus, the most consistent change in climate across sites in this study was due to significant increases in minimum monthly temperatures.

evidence for site-specific temperature increases from  <dig> –  <dig> was evident for these three temperature indicators . five of the seven sites showed linear or curvilinear increases in mintmp, usually starting in the 1970's and extending until  <dig>  in contrast, both fayetteville and englewood, nj have experienced significant temporal decreases in maxtmp . causes for these decreases are obscure, but in new jersey may be due to the exaggerated temperature fluctuations in the early 1990's .

concurrent with these temperature shifts, chromosome elements in populations of d. robusta show systematic temporal frequency changes . x chromosome combinations 1s and s <dig> show substantial frequency changes with time, with s <dig> doing so in a site-specific manner . frequencies of combination 1s have decreased over time, and are negatively correlated with increasing temperatures . increases in s <dig> are only marginally correlated with temperature, but this may be due to other factors, including its low frequency in eastern populations . gene arrangements 2l- <dig> and 3r- <dig> have also increased in frequency since  <dig> , and the changes are significantly site-specific as indicated by the significant year × site interactions. while temporal changes in 2l- <dig> and 3r- <dig> are correlated , only those of 3r- <dig> are significantly correlated with increasing temperatures .

the most consistent historical changes have been gains in the frequency of arrangement 3r- <dig> with concomitant decreases of its allelic form, 3r . coupled with the clinal tendency of 3r- <dig>  varying between 100% in the southernmost latitudes and zero in the northernmost  <cit> , its similar directional increases of recent years in at least four states, some far apart, and concordance with long term temperature increases indicates that 3r- <dig> is responding to regional climatic shifts.

the frequency of arrangement 2l- <dig> increased directionally in most of the same localities as 3r- <dig> . the frequency of 2l- <dig>  which is also more common in the south than in the north, has been decreasing steadily, almost to the point of extinction, in the four northern  <dig> populations. this is probably not a temperature effect, however, as in the past 2l- <dig> has been irregularly distributed across the southern states, rarely rising above frequencies of  <dig> percent, without evidence of a latitudinal cline  <cit> .

like 2l- <dig> and 3r- <dig>  the frequency of gene arrangement xl , tends to be higher in southern populations than in northern ones  <cit> . except for a few deviations in small samples, it has increased steadily – with concomitant decreases in northern arrangement xl- <dig> – in all the localities studied except olivette  and iowa. at englewood, for example, it rose from about 40% in  <dig> to an average of 78% in 2000– <dig>  that of northern arrangement xl- <dig> falling from about 60% to about 22% in the same period. frequencies of x chromosome combination 1s  are clearly consistent with this pattern .

discussion
studies of drosophila inversion polymorphisms have now provided historical insights into environmental change. on different continents, temporal genetic changes correlated with increasing temperatures in populations of d. subobscura  <cit>  and d. robusta  bear the imprint of large scale climate change. for d. robusta, not all temporal changes were consistent with this hypothesis. in the course of comparing plant growth in rural and urban areas in relation to ozone exposure, rural areas tended to have lower average temperatures than urban ones  <cit> ; this may explain the smaller  change in 3r- <dig> frequencies in relatively rural fayetteville and iowa city as compared to the more urban locales. also, there are fewer data available for these sites collected over time spans long enough to document temporal trends. another possibility is that the climatic changes have not been of equal intensity in all localities, as indicated by regional increases and decreases in local temperatures  suggested by the site by year interactions for avtmp and maxtmp in the ancova analyses.

carson  <cit>  noted that the chromosomal variation in populations of drosophila robusta at olivette, missouri over a 10-year period was characterized by "extraordinary stability," wherein "certain frequencies may shift significantly as compared with the previous year, but in every case the observed frequencies approximate some previously observed level." this pattern continued until at least  <dig> . temperature records from this period seem rather stable before significantly increasing through  <dig> . similar stability, frequency changes of less than  <dig> percent, has also been recorded near blacksburg, virginia from  <dig> to  <dig>  and in northeastern new jersey from  <dig> until at least  <dig> .

by contrast, every population sampled in  <dig> evidenced at least one significant change of chromosomal polymorphism frequency compared to the numbers in the same area ten or more years previously, with indication that the changes in at least three are part of similar, if not identical, directional historical processes. therefore, documentation of temporal genetic changes in these populations requires at least  <dig> to  <dig> years of comparative data.

influences of natural selection due to ambient temperature variation on frequencies of these gene arrangements and x chromosome associations have been demonstrated in laboratory experiments  <cit> , and inferences from latitudinal and multiple elevational clines  <cit> . frequencies of arrangements xl- <dig> and 2l- <dig> are clearly associated with cooler temperatures at higher elevations and latitudes, and 2l- <dig> increases in frequency in the laboratory under warmer temperatures. carriers of 2l- <dig> have shorter egg to adult development times expressed in cooler temperatures, explaining increases in this gene arrangement with elevation and latitude  <cit> .

evidence of strong natural selection maintaining earlier observed genetic stability has also come from perturbation experiments in the wild  <cit> . at four time periods, large numbers of flies carrying x-chromosome combinations s <dig> and  <dig>  autosomal combination 2l- <dig> r- <dig> , and 3r- <dig> from south carolina, alabama, and mississippi were released in midsummer in the englewood, nj woods. in other years the released flies carried xl- <dig>  2l- <dig>  and 3r from minnesota and michigan. despite evidence of hybridization of the introduced flies with the local population, in each case the following spring saw return to frequencies of the previous year.

according to wright  <cit> , "the alternative to natural selection in a changing environment is, as noted by dobzhansky  <cit> , the emergence of superior genetic systems" in the gene arrangements that have been increasing in frequency. he envisioned this happening in one population by recombination in inversion homozygotes, with the new adaptive gene complex in one or a few flies spreading to other localities by "occasional very long dispersion by the wind." he conceded that such a hypothesis would be most satisfactory for cases where a very rare inversion suddenly started increasing, such as the rises of tl and pp of d. pseudoobscura mentioned above, since high frequencies of inversion homozygotes would undermine the structural stability of the new adaptive complex. the sudden rises of d. robusta x-chromosome combination s <dig> in new york and new jersey and of s <dig> in missouri could be cases in point, but it would not explain the near doubling of s <dig> in arkansas from a 35% base between  <dig> and  <dig> nor the three most consistent directional changes, those of 3r- <dig>  2l- <dig>  and xl . indeed, the nearly simultaneous changes in places as far apart as new york and allentown, pennsylvania, let alone new york and missouri, would be very unlikely to depend on chance wind-blown dispersions.

here, causes for systematic frequency changes in widespread populations can be inferred to be a result of common environmental causes given the large amount of background data available for d. robusta. when compared to the inversion frequency data collected over  <dig> years from more than  <dig> natural populations  <cit>  and results from numerous laboratory experiments, temporal frequency shifts across the range of d. robusta strongly suggest temperature variation as a likely mechanism driving microevolutionary change  <cit> . such regional frequency shifts suggest a common response to temperature fluctuations or causes correlated with them, whether due to regional climatic changes or global warming.

CONCLUSIONS
although direct evidence for climatic change has been accumulating for many years, its consequences for causing evolutionary changes have only recently been observed. chromosome polymorphisms in drosophila species have been historically important genetic systems for understanding mechanisms of evolutionary change, and have now been studied long enough to begin revealing widespread, systematic temporal frequency shifts in response to environmental change. these polymorphisms thus represent excellent indicators of future climatic shifts.
