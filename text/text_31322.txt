BACKGROUND
a skeletal muscle fiber is an extra-large, multinucleated, non-mitotic cells that are responsible for the generation of force by skeletal muscle under the control of motor neurones. this unique terminally differentiated cells are derived from multinucleated myotubes, which are formed by the fusion of mononucleated myogenic progenitor cells . myoblasts are descendants of muscle stem cells called muscle satellite cells and show unique capacities, including multipotentiality
 <cit>  and the ability to fuse with each other in a cell-autonomous way. myoblast fusion is cell-specific, because myoblasts do not fuse with non-myogenic cells, and essential for skeletal muscle development and repair.

myoblast fusion consists of a series of steps: cell-cell contact, recognition, adhesion, and plasma membrane breakdown/union
 <cit> . plasma membrane breakdown/union is initially induced in a discrete area of the plasma membrane
 <cit> . thus, specialization of presumptive fusion sites in the plasma membrane is prerequisite for myogenic cell fusion. extracellular matrix receptor integrins and adhesion molecules such as cadherins, ncam, cd <dig>  cd <dig>  and adams might contribute to regulation of the recognition/adhesion steps of myoblast fusion
 <cit> . however, how they accumulate at the discrete, presumptively fusion-competent sites of the plasma membrane remains to be determined.

our previous study showed that the leading edge of lamellipodia and membrane ruffles of differentiating myogenic cells contain fusion-competent sites in the plasma membrane
 <cit> . adhesion proteins accumulate at the presumptive fusion sites of differentiating myogenic cells in a lipid raft-dependent fashion prior to cell contact
 <cit> , while membrane fusion takes place within cholesterol-free sites of the plasma membrane
 <cit> . membrane cholesterol is enriched in lipid rafts. however, these results are not discrepant because dynamic clustering and dispersion of lipid rafts plays a pivotal role in the redistribution of adhesion complexes and membrane cholesterol at the presumptively fusion-competent sites of the plasma membrane in myogenic cells
 <cit> . the adhesion complexes accumulate in a micrometer-scaled lipid raft  in a cell contact-independent fashion under the differentiation-inducing condition, whereas they are distributed in both raft and non-raft fractions of plasma membranes in growing myogenic cells. therefore, both the recruitment of adhesion complexes to lipid rafts and the organization of microrafts might be critical to plasma membrane breakdown/union of myogenic cells.

m-cadherin is a myogenic cell-specific classic cadherin that plays a pivotal role in myogenic cell fusion
 <cit> . adhesion-complex proteins including m-cadherin, β-catenin, and p <dig> catenin accumulate in microrafts at presumptive fusion sites even if myogenic cells do not contact a fusion partner
 <cit> . the present study showed that recruitment of m-cadherin/p <dig> complex to lipid rafts and organization of microrafts are two distinct pre-fusion events that are essential for the specialization of fusion-competent sites.

methods

 <cit> . for induction of myogenic differentiation, the cells were plated and cultured for 24 h in pmgm, and then the medium was changed to pmdm consisting of the chemically defined medium tis
 <cit>  supplemented with 2% fbs. a ric10-derived clone constitutively expressing gfp-gpi, ggs25

RESULTS
m-cadherin is recruited to lipid rafts during myogenic differentiation
dynamic clustering and dispersion of lipid rafts at the leading edge of lamellipodia and membrane ruffles that contain presumptive fusion sites is critical for myogenic cell fusion
 <cit> . we focused on a molecular mechanism underlying recruitment of m-cadherin to the presumptive fusion site. ggs25
 <cit>  is a mouse myogenic cell line that constitutively expresses gpi-anchored gfp  as a raft marker. cells were cultured at low cell density to avoid cell-cell contact. subcellular fractionation of ggs <dig> cells by density gradient ultracentrifugation showed that most m-cadherin was located at non-raft membranes in growing myogenic cells . m-cadherin was recruited to lipid rafts under the terminal muscle differentiation-inducing condition, whereas the concentrations of raft marker molecules, flotillin and ganglioside gm <dig>  remained constant during myogenesis . the results were consistent with the previous observation showing that m-cadherin is accumulated at lipid rafts in cell contact-free regions of plasma membrane
 <cit> .

active rac <dig> enhances myogenic cell fusion
the small g protein rac <dig> is known to play a pivotal role in lamellipodium formation in various cell types. rac <dig> physically interacts with m-cadherin
 <cit>  and is activated by p120
 <cit>  and m-cadherin
 <cit> . therefore, we determined whether rac <dig> is involved in the recruitment of m-cadherin to lipid rafts during myogenic cell fusion.

expression plasmids encoding gfp-fused wild , constitutively active , or dominant negative  rac <dig> were transfected into ric <dig> cells under the differentiation-inducing condition to avoid the inhibitory effects of rac <dig> on the initiation of myogenesis
 <cit> . therefore, myhc was expressed in  <dig> %,  <dig> %, or  <dig> % of ric <dig> cells transfected with gfp-rac1wt, ca, or dn expression plasmids, respectively . fusion indexes were  <dig> %,  <dig> %, or  <dig> % in ric <dig> cells expressing rac1wt, ca, or dn, respectively. in addition, rac1ca-expressing ric <dig> cells gave rise to large multinucleated cells called myosheets
 <cit>  containing more than  <dig> nuclei . it suggests that rac1ca promotes cell fusion between myotubes or myoblasts and myotubes as well as myoblasts. in contrast, ric <dig> cells expressing rac1dn formed small myotubes exclusively . the results indicated that rac <dig> promotes myogenic cell fusion depending on its activity.

rac <dig> activity is required for microraft organization at presumptive fusion sites
gfp-rac1dn prevented lamellipodium formation and often induced a severely abnormal morphology in ric <dig> cells , implying that it produced unphysiologically severe damage to the cells, perhaps due to the disordered arrangement of cytoskeletons. therefore, we used the rac <dig> inhibitor nsc <dig> to inhibit rac <dig> activity to more moderate levels. nsc <dig> did not inhibit the expression of myhc at 100 μm , although it attenuated myogenesis of ric <dig> at 200 μm . however, 100 μm nsc <dig> inhibited myogenic cell fusion without compromising the expression of myhc , as previously described in c2c <dig> cells
 <cit> .

to determine the role of rac <dig> in microraft organization, ggs <dig> cells expressing gfp-gpi were treated with nsc <dig>  lipid rafts were visualized in living cells by gfp-gpi under an epifluorescence microscope. microrafts were rarely organized under the growing condition , but organization of microrafts was markedly promoted at membrane ruffles under the differentiation-inducing condition . intensive gfp fluorescence at membrane ruffles of differentiating ggs <dig> cells showed dense clusters produced by a large number of nanometer-sized lipid rafts. in contrast, microraft organization was severely suppressed in differentiating ggs <dig> cells treated with nsc <dig> .

to quantify the inhibitory effects of nsc <dig> on microraft organization, a microraft visualized by gfp-gpi was observed by time-lapse recording for 1 h from the indicated time in figure 
3e. the number of cells that organized microrafts at membrane ruffles markedly increased under the differentiation-inducing condition . the frequency of microraft organization at lamellipodia of an individual cell also increased . in contrast, nsc <dig> prevented microraft organization at membrane ruffles . the frequency of microraft organization at lamellipodia severely declined in nsc23766-treated cells compared to that of untreated cells . these results showed that rac <dig> plays a pivotal role in microraft formation at the presumptive fusion site and suggest that organization of microraft is essential for myogenic cell fusion.

rac <dig> activity is dispensable for recruitment of m-cadherin to lipid rafts and interaction with p <dig> catenin
in the next series of experiments, we determined whether a rac1-dependent organization of microrafts is required for differentiation-induced recruitment of m-cadherin to lipid rafts. the plasma membrane was fractionated by density gradient ultracentrifugation. nsc <dig> did not affect the amounts of m-cadherin and raft markers flotillin and gm <dig> in the raft fraction . furthermore, similar concentrations of p <dig> were found in immunoprecipitates from both control and nsc23766-treated ric <dig> cells with anti-m-cadherin antibody . thus, microraft organization might be regulated independently of the recruitment of m-cadherin and p <dig> to nanometer-sized lipid rafts and their physical interaction.

m-cadherin interacts with p <dig> catenin predominantly at lipid rafts during myogenic differentiation
cell contact-independent recruitment of adhesion molecules to lipid rafts is likely to be a critical step of myogenic cell fusion
 <cit> . p <dig> catenin is a probable candidate for a key molecule in recruitment of m-cadherin because it regulates the locations of n-cadherin in lipid rafts
 <cit> . the amounts of m-cadherin increased prior to the expression of the muscle-differentiation marker myosin heavy chain  . the amounts of p <dig> catenin increased slightly. in addition, a specific antibody against the tyrosine phosphorylated form of p <dig> revealed that its phosphorylation was robustly enhanced during myogenic differentiation . phosphorylation of threonine residues of p <dig> was also enhanced. co-immunoprecipitation assays indicated that physical interaction between m-cadherin and p <dig> was promoted during myogenic differentiation . in addition, the complex including m-cadherin and p <dig> catenin was found predominantly in lipid rafts . the results suggest that m-cadherin is associated with p <dig> in a lipid raft–dependent fashion during myogenic differentiation.

to determine the role of src family kinases in interaction of p <dig> with m-cadherin, ric <dig> cells were treated with the src kinase inhibitor su <dig> because src family kinases are major protein kinases that phosphorylate tyrosine residues of p120
 <cit> . su <dig> markedly attenuated the interaction between p <dig> and m-cadherin . furthermore, the amounts of m-cadherin and p <dig> at lipid rafts declined in su6656-treated cells . recruitment of n-cadherin to lipid rafts was also attenuated by su <dig> in a manner similar to m-cadherin . su <dig> attenuated physical interaction between m-cadherin and p <dig> catenin, and their recruitment to lipid rafts, implicating the role of src family kinases in the regulation of recruitment of m-cadherin to lipid rafts.

src kinase inhibitor suppresses myogenic cell fusion without compromising myogenic differentiation
recruitment of m-cadherin to lipid rafts is supposed to be indispensable for its accumulation at the presumptive fusion site
 <cit> . actually, su <dig> suppressed myogenic cell fusion in a dose-dependent manner , although it did not inhibit expression of the myogenic differentiation marker myhc , m-cadherin, or p <dig> . inhibition of cell fusion by su <dig> resulted in a severe reduction in the number of larger myofibers containing more than  <dig> nuclei .

src kinase inhibitor suppresses accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated p <dig> and organization of microrafts
despite the robust inhibition by su <dig> of recruitment of m-cadherin to lipid rafts and myogenic cell fusion, antibodies recognizing phosphorylated tyrosine residue  <dig> of p <dig> did not show a decline in the amounts of tyrosine phosphorylated p <dig> in the total cell lysate . in addition, the amounts of tyrosine phosphorylated p <dig> increased when treated with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate . thus, turnover of phosphorylated tyrosine residues of p <dig> might depend predominantly on tyrosine phosphatase. the results suggest that other src kinase substrates are involved in physical interaction between m-cadherin and p <dig> catenin, and their recruitment to lipid rafts.

it is likely that subcellular localization of p <dig> is critical to myogenic cell fusion. therefore, the effects of su <dig> on the subcellular distribution of tyrosine-phosphorylated p <dig> in differentiating myogenic cells were determined. immunostaining analyses showed that tyrosine phosphorylated p <dig> accumulated at membrane ruffles . su <dig> inhibited the distribution of p <dig> at membrane ruffles . thus, src family kinases might induce the redistribution of p <dig> at membrane ruffles through phosphorylation of other substrates. in contrast, p <dig> accumulated at cell contacts even in su6656-treated cells  as well as in control cultures .

to determine whether su <dig> inhibits membrane ruffling in differentiating myogenic cells, ric <dig> cells were sequentially observed by time-lapse recording. the plasma membrane of myogenic cells frequently ruffled during myogenic differentiation . su <dig> prevented membrane ruffling within 10 minutes after administration . the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate did not affect membrane ruffling of ric <dig> cells . however, a 20-min pretreatment with a high concentration of vanadate  partially but clearly antagonized the inhibitory effect of su <dig> on membrane ruffling of ric <dig> cells . the results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation under the control of src kinase is involved in the regulation of membrane ruffling.

to obtain direct evidence that su <dig> affects the organization of microrafts, gfp-gpi in ggs <dig> cells was sequentially observed by time-lapse recording. rapid cycles of clustering and dispersion of microrafts were visualized by gfp-gpi under epifluorescence microscopy . in contrast, su <dig> perfectly suppressed the organization of microrafts .

taken together with the results above, it is suggested that src kinase plays a critical role in recruitment of m-cadherin/p <dig> to lipid rafts. in addition, the results imply that the recruitment of adhesion proteins to lipid rafts might be relevant to microraft organization at the presumptive fusion site.

discussion
dynamic clustering and dispersion of lipid rafts is required to establish fusion-competent sites on the myogenic cell membrane
 <cit> . although cell adhesion and membrane fusion are sequential steps in myogenic cell fusion, both steps require distinct microcircumstances in the plasma membrane. to establish cell adhesion, the plasma membrane at the presumptive fusion site must contain enough cholesterol to maintain the rigid lipid bilayers that hold adhesion complexes. however, membrane fusion takes place at cholesterol-free spots of the plasma membrane
 <cit> , and adhesion complexes are removed from the fusion site prior to membrane breakdown/union
 <cit> . the dynamic clustering and dispersion of lipid rafts enables robust and rapid changes in plasma membrane components at the presumptive fusion site. however, the pre-fusion events required for specialization of fusion-competent sites have been unknown. the present study showed that both the recruitment of adhesion complexes to lipid rafts and the organization of microrafts are required for establishing fusion-competent sites.

one possible mechanism of m-cadherin recruitment to lipid rafts could be based on control of its binding with p <dig> catenin. p <dig> is essential for stability of cadherins on the plasma membrane in a direct interaction-dependent manner
 <cit> . tyrosine-phosphorylated p <dig> shows increased affinity to cadherins
 <cit> . tyrosine phosphorylation of p <dig> also requires recruitment of p <dig> to plasma membranes
 <cit> . in addition, only membrane-associated src can phosphorylate p120
 <cit> . however, we were unable to detect a significant difference in the total amounts of tyrosine-phosphorylated p <dig> between control and src kinase inhibitor su6656-treated differentiating myogenic cells. a major fraction of tyrosine-phosphorylated p <dig> retained the phosphorylated state even when src family kinases were inhibited. despite that, su <dig> inhibited differentiation-induced recruitment of m-cadherin/p <dig> to lipid rafts and their physical interaction. thus, in the physiological cellular context, another src kinase substrate might play a role in the recruitment of m-cadherin/p <dig> to lipid rafts. actually, src kinase stimulates the e-cadherin regulator protein to regulate cell-cell adhesion
 <cit> . crosstalk between camp-dependent protein kinase  and src pathways
 <cit>  is another possible mode of src kinase action for m-cadherin recruitment because the localized pka pathway is involved in the specialization of the fusion-competent areas of the plasma membrane in myogenic cells
 <cit> .

su <dig> prevented both microraft organization and membrane ruffling. src family kinases bind to the autophosphorylated focal adhesion kinase  that is activated by integrin-mediated adhesion
 <cit> . the active fak-src complex stimulates rac <dig> activity through phosphorylation of a number of mediators including the scaffolding protein p130cas, paxillin, paxillin kinase linker, pak-interacting exchange factor-beta, and spleen tyrosine kinase. thus, src is likely to play a role in microraft organization through stimulation of rac <dig> activity.

p <dig> catenin also modulates the activity and spatial distribution of rac1
 <cit> . either su <dig> or the rac <dig> inhibitor nsc <dig> inhibited the organization of microrafts, the generation of membrane ruffles/lamellipodia, and cell fusion of myogenic cells under the differentiation-inducing condition. we were unable to detect a significant difference between control and su6656-treated cells in the total rac <dig> activity by a pull-down assay. however, we did see effects of su <dig> on differentiating myogenic cells similar to those of nsc <dig>  the p120-knockdown inhibits the lamellipodia dynamics and localization of rac <dig> but doesn’t decrease the total rac <dig> activity
 <cit> . su <dig> might modulate the spatial distribution of rac <dig>  as shown in p <dig> knockdown cells.

subcellular distribution of cadherins is determined by at least two distinct dynamic cycles: the trans-directional membrane-cytoplasmic transport/endocytosis cycle
 <cit>  and the cis-directional lateral clustering/dispersion cycle within the plasma membrane
 <cit> . the underlying mechanism controlling the recruitment of cadherin to lipid rafts remained to be discerned, while relevant factors, including clathrin and p <dig> catenin, have been proposed for regulation of the membrane transport/endocytosis cycle
 <cit> . in the cis-cycle, the distribution of m-cadherin in lipid rafts or non-raft regions of the plasma membrane corresponds to a dynamic equilibrium of association and dissociation with p <dig>  the accumulation of m-cadherin at microrafts is found at both cell contact and presumptive fusion sites of myogenic cells
 <cit> . the present study shows that m-cadherin is recruited to lipid rafts independently of the microraft organization. the previous and present studies imply that the functional m-cadherin/p <dig> catenin complex is first recruited to nanometer-sized lipid rafts . then, either cell-cell contact or myogenic differentiation induces nanorafts to give rise to a microraft, resulting in the robust accumulation of cadherin/p <dig> complexes at the cell contact and presumptive fusion site .

n-cadherin as well as m-cadherin plays a role in myogenic cell fusion
 <cit> . n-cadherin also accumulates at microrafts at ruffling membranes and the leading edge of lamellipodia of differentiating myogenic cells
 <cit> . p <dig> is involved in the regulation of n-cadherin location in lipid rafts
 <cit> . in addition, the present study shows that su <dig> also suppressed the recruitment of n-cadherin to lipid rafts. taken together, the recruitment of n-cadherin and m-cadherin to lipid rafts might have common mechanisms in differentiating myogenic cells.

cadherins are involved in cell recognition and adhesion by homophilic interactions conferred by their extracellular regions. their intracellular regions link them with cytoplasmic partner proteins and consequently the actin filament network. thus, our findings on the accumulation of cadherins at the presumptive fusion sites might be related to remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. we previously analyzed the arrangement of f-actin during myogenic cell fusion
 <cit> . briefly, cadherin complex is co-aligned with f-actin at ruffling membranes and the leading edge of lamellipodia. the cortical actin cytoskeleton at presumptive fusion sites might play a critical role in lateral dispersion of lipid rafts. interestingly, after myogenic cell fusion, both the ruffling membrane and lamellipodium disappear except at the polar ends of myotubes
 <cit> . the localized accumulation of cadherins at the polar ends of myotubes might create anchoring points of actin filaments and contribute to remodeling actin cytoskeleton during myogenic differentiation.

the present results suggest that the recruitment of m-cadherin/p <dig> complex to lipid rafts of cell contact − free surfaces is essential for the specialization of fusion-competent areas of the plasma membrane. src kinase activity is likely to be critical to the recruitment of m-cadherin to lipid rafts. rac <dig> induces the dynamic organization of microrafts at the presumptive fusion site. however, the mechanism connecting these two sequential events has not been discerned. it is likely that rac <dig> is activated downstream of src kinase and m-cadherin/p <dig> during myogenic differentiation
 <cit> . the present study provides a possible molecular mechanism underlying the specialization of presumptive fusion sites of myogenic cells.

CONCLUSIONS
myoblast fusion consists of a series of steps including plasma membrane breakdown/union that is initially induced in a discrete area of the plasma membrane.

however, the pre-fusion events that are relevant to specialization of fusion-competent sites of the plasma membrane remained to be discerned. here we showed that the procedure establishing fusion-competent sites consists of two sequential events: the recruitment of adhesion complexes to lipid rafts and the organization of microrafts . the recruitment of m-cadherin to lipid rafts depended on interaction with p <dig> catenin, whereas the organization of microrafts was controlled by a small g protein, rac <dig>
