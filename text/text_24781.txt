BACKGROUND
over the last decades, production traits have been studied and exploited for the genetic improvement of livestock through selective breeding  <cit> . at the same time, diseases that can cause substantial economic losses have emerged. there is little doubt about the economic and welfare implications of infectious diseases or about the existence of genetic variation in disease susceptibility and resistance in livestock populations  <cit> . however, research aimed at identifying genetic factors that confer relative susceptibility or resistance against diseases in pigs is limited by the lack of sufficient phenotypic observations. thus, including health traits in the current breeding schemes while limiting loss in long-term selected production traits is a major concern and stands as an emerging trend in pig breeding  <cit> .

direct strategies that target animal resistance or tolerance to specific pathogens, may result in increased susceptibility to other diseases  <cit> . therefore, we and other authors have suggested an indirect approach focused on immunity traits   <cit> . its measured on healthy animals are studied as candidate traits for immune capacity. to define immune capacity or immunocompetence, it is necessary to know how the immune system of an individual responds to different stimuli , and its efficiency. therefore, the term immunocompetence may be defined as the ability of the host to launch an immune response of sufficient specificity and magnitude, and thus is a rough indication of the effective quality of the host’s immune system  <cit> . for instance, in poultry for which many studies are available, he et al. <cit>  demonstrated that chicken lines with functionally less active heterophils  were more susceptible to infections by salmonella enteritidis than those with highly functional heterophils. furthermore, swaggerty et al.  <cit>  reported that broilers selected for higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines had a more efficient pro-inflammatory profile that contributed in part to increased resistance against pathogens. thus, identifying candidate its that could predict immunocompetence is a major issue in animal production systems. we and others have shown that a large number of its are heritable, which suggests that genetic selection on its is feasible  <cit> . the new challenge is to identify heritable its that are significantly associated with health or disease resistance and may predict the efficiency of an individual’s immune response before biotic or abiotic stresses occur  <cit> .

peripheral blood cells are now widely used as a surrogate tissue to monitor individuals for various markers  <cit> . blood cells constitute one of the first lines of the immune defence system  <cit> . for studies on immunocompetence, blood is considered as a target tissue that contains the different immune cells that circulate in the whole body. indeed, profiling gene transcripts in blood has earned its place in the molecular and cellular profiling approaches used to analyse the immune response in patients with a wide range of diseases in humans  <cit> . moreover, analysis of the blood transcriptome can contribute to identify immune response specific signatures  associated with specific its, which might be translated into useful molecular biomarkers for differential immunocompetence. ultimately these biomarkers or patterns of markers could help to improve animal selection programs.

huang et al. <cit>  and arceo et al. <cit>  have shown that pig blood transcriptome is informative to monitor disease susceptibility, to characterize response to immune stimulation  <cit>  or to refine the characterization of certain its  <cit> . in the present study, our first objective was to perform blood transcriptome profiling in pigs with extreme it levels and without any initial focus on resistance to specific pathogens. our second objective was to investigate whether genome-wide transcriptional data in blood can lead to the identification of candidate biomarkers associated with variations of its.

RESULTS
the blood transcriptome varies significantly for four of the eight its tested
eight its were considered in an extreme phenotype study design . the its were classified into two subsets corresponding to  its measured after in vitro stimulation ) and  its measured in vivo from blood , γδ t lymphocyte count , and level of igg specific to mycoplasma hyopneumoniae ). the average and standard deviation of extreme groups for each it are in table  <dig>  and information on their distribution is in additional file 1: figure s <dig> and additional file 2: figure s <dig>  on average, a statistically significant difference between the means of each pair of groups was observed for each it at the 5% level . we identified differentially expressed  genes for il <dig> and il <dig> productions, phag and cd4-/cd8+ cell counts its . since gene expression was not significantly affected in the blood of pigs with different ifnγ, tnfα, tcr γδ+ counts and igg-mh levels, we focused our study on the association between il <dig> and il <dig> productions, phag and cd4-/cd8+ and gene expression. to validate technically the microarray gene expression data, blood rna samples were analysed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction  for  <dig> genes . rt-qpcr results confirmed the microarray expression levels for  <dig> of the  <dig> selected genes . observed correlations between rt-qpcr results and microarray gene expressions were consistently high, with most genes having r <dig> values >  <dig> .

differentially expressed genes in animals with contrasted in vitro production levels of il2
we identified  <dig> genes de in the blood from pigs with extreme levels of il <dig> . the fold change  of de genes ranged from - <dig>  to  <dig>  when high  and low  groups were compared. hierarchical cluster analysis  and principal component analysis  were applied to search for classifiers. the hca animal dendogram separated the h and l groups, although one animal of the h group clustered with the piglets of the l group . on the gene axis, two main gene clusters  were detected. a total of  <dig> genes in cluster  <dig> was over-expressed in animals of the h group compared to the l group . conversely,  <dig> genes in cluster  <dig> were significantly under-expressed in the h group versus the l group. the first component of pca, projecting the arrows onto the first dimension, explained  <dig> % of the total variability in gene expression and identified the de genes that contributed most to the separation between the two groups .

to gain insight on the functions of the blood transcriptome that differed significantly between the h and l groups, we measured the subsets of de genes by using the core analysis function included in ingenuity pathways analysis . in the h group, ipa showed that the most significant over-expressed  biological functions were related with cell growth, proliferation and development, cell death and survival, cellular and molecular transport, lipid metabolism, and immune cell trafficking . by contrast, biological functions related to cell death and survival, cell signalling, cell-mediated immune response, immune cell trafficking, and inflammatory and infectious diseases were under-expressed ; additional file 6). significant canonical pathways that were induced in the h group compared to the l group were associated with mtor signalling, pi3k signalling, regulation of eif <dig> and p706k signalling and tight junctions signalling .

differentially expressed genes in animals with contrasted in vitro production levels of il10
as shown in table  <dig>  genes were de in the blood of pigs with contrasted il <dig> levels . the fc of the de genes ranged from - <dig>  to  <dig>  when the h and l groups were compared. on the one hand, the hca animal dendogram showed that one animal from the l group clustered within the h group  and on the other hand, it identified two gene clusters: cluster  <dig> with  <dig> genes and cluster  <dig> with  <dig> genes. most of the genes in cluster  <dig> were significantly down-expressed in the h group versus the l group, whereas in cluster  <dig> the opposite was observed . in addition, the first component of pca explained  <dig> % of the total variability in gene expression . in figure 3b, the main genes that contribute to the separation of the two extreme groups are indicated in red. as shown in figure  <dig>  biological functions that were significantly less expressed  in the h group compared to the l group were primarily involved in immune t-cell activation and trafficking functions , lipid metabolism, immunological diseases, cellular function, maintenance, assembly and organization , as well as in cellular movement and proliferation . by contrast, most biological functions associated with cellular movement, cell death and survival, and immune cell trafficking were over-expressed  in the h group compared to the l group .

differentially expressed genes in animals with contrasted phagocytic capacities
a large number of genes  was significantly de between animals with extreme phagocytic capacity . the fc of the de genes ranged from - <dig>  to  <dig>  between the two groups. furthermore, the hca animal dendogram separated two main clusters each with a mixture of animals belonging to both the h and l groups, which suggests that the l group could be split into two subgroups . for the gene variables, two main hca clusters were identified. clusters  <dig>  and  <dig>  were primarily down-and over-expressed in the h group compared to the l group, respectively . the first component of pca  clearly separated the two groups and about 80% of the genes showed a high correlation with the two principal components  . some of the most significant genes that separated the h and l groups are indicated in red in figure 4b. comparison of the extreme groups showed that the foremost over-represented ipa biological functions  were related to nutrient metabolism . conversely, humoral immune response, infectious disease, cell-mediated immune response, cellular growth and proliferation, cellular maintenance and development, cell signalling, and amino acid metabolism were down-expressed  in the h group versus the l group . a precise examination of the canonical pathways revealed that inflammatory response, such as cd <dig> signalling in t helper cells, ctl4a signalling in cytotoxic t lymphocytes, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> production and signalling, t cell receptor signalling, as well as jak/stat signalling were over-represented  in the h group . by contrast, in the l group, an increased expression  of canonical pathways associated with acute phase response signalling, complement system, and lxr/rxr activation  was observed.

differentially expressed genes in animals with contrasted αβ t lymphocyte cd4-/cd8+counts
fifty-two de genes were identified between groups with contrasted cd4-/cd8+ counts . the fc of de genes ranged from - <dig>  to  <dig>  between the extreme groups. the hca revealed a clear difference in gene expression patterns between the two groups. indeed, the animal dendogram showed a higher divergence between individuals from different groups, which supports the fact that the small number of animals analysed per condition in this study was sufficient to reach a conclusion . for the gene variables, two clusters were identified. clusters  <dig>  and  <dig>  were respectively down- and up-expressed in the h group versus the l group . the first component of the pca captured  <dig> % of the total variance, which indicated that this component represented most of the expression pattern of the individual samples. about 90% of the genes showed a high correlation with the two principal components . genes that are highly correlated with the two principal components are indicated in red in figure 5b. regarding biological functions and canonical pathways, the de genes were related to cell death and survival , cell morphology , cell-to-cell signalling and interaction , cellular development , and infectious diseases . however, the number of genes was too small for a reliable detection of enriched canonical pathways .

identification of candidate biomarkers by testing a validation population
in order to validate our results and identify potential gene biomarkers for the its included in the study, we used a validation set of  <dig> animals. sparse partial least square regression   <cit>  and regularized canonical correlation analysis   <cit>  statistical methods were applied to identify potential gene biomarkers. spls revealed a large covariance between expression of genes and distinct its. q <dig> values, which have a meaning in terms of variable importance measure, showed that the best-explained variable was cd4-/cd8+ . based on expression levels, most of the genes were negatively associated with il <dig>  il <dig> and cd4-/cd8+ its, but positively associated with phagocytosis activity . the most striking result was the negative covariation between the following genes i.e. tumour necrosis factor receptor superfamily member  <dig> , glycine amidinotransferase , mitochondrial ribosomal protein l <dig> , arachidonate 12- lipoxygenase , complement factor b , sushi-repeat containing protein , protein o– fucosyltransferase  <dig>  or talin- <dig> , and the il <dig> and cd4-/cd8+ its. another important finding was the strong positive covariation between dna-damage-inducible transcript  <dig> , granulysin , the ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator , cx3c chemokine receptor  <dig> , kruppel-like factor  <dig>  and the cd4-/cd8+ it. focusing on correlation rather than covariance also enabled us to detect an association between the expression of selected genes and its . spls and rcca analyses identified a total of  <dig> genes that were highly associated with at least one it and that could be considered as potential gene biomarkers . the suitability of these potential gene biomarkers was further assessed by the receiver operating characteristic  curve analysis and the area under the curve  in an extreme phenotype study design. interestingly, the results demonstrated that  <dig> genes could be potential biomarkers to discriminate between h and l groups for il <dig>  phag and cd4-/cd8+ immune traits . among these  <dig> genes, gnly and klrg <dig> achieved the highest predictive performance in discriminating high from low cd4-/cd8+ levels . the average expression intensity of the gnly gene was  <dig>  times greater in the h group than in the l group for cd4-/cd8+, with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 70%, respectively, and an auc of roc curve of  <dig>  . the average expression intensity of klrg <dig> was two times greater in the h group than in the l group for cd4-/cd8+, with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 80% and an auc of  <dig> . lastly, the cx3cr <dig> gene was also shown to be a good potential gene biomarker to differentiate between h and l groups for cd4-/cd8+. the ralgds and alox <dig> genes were identified as potential gene biomarkers to classify correctly il <dig> production and phagocytosis activity, respectively .

discussion
blood transcriptome analyses were carried out to compare groups of animals with contrasted values for eight its. for each it, we compared two groups of extreme animals, which presented significantly different mean values of the it of interest. because selection of the extreme animals included in the experimental sets was based on more stringent criteria and new quality filters were used in the gene analysis, the results reported here refine those of a previous report  <cit> . de genes were identified for in vitro production of il <dig> and il <dig>  phagocytosis activity and cd4-/cd8+ cell counts but not for the in vitro production of tnfα or ifnγ, the in vivo tcrγδ+ cell counts, and the levels of igg-mh.

blood transcriptome provides information to refine in vitro measured its: a potential of prediction
we identified gene expression profiles in blood  that were significantly associated with variations in its measured after in vitro blood stimulation, which suggests that the information provided by the peripheral blood can predict a response to a stimulus.

to our knowledge, the effects of varying il <dig> levels on the genome-wide gene expression in the blood of pigs have not been studied to date. although expression by naïve cd8+ t cells and dendritic cells has been reported  <cit> , il- <dig> is a cytokine produced primarily by activated cd4+ t cells. the main physiological functions of il- <dig> are critical for the enhancement of cellular immune responses, and include induction of cytotoxic t cells, activation of natural killer cells , production of other cytokines by t cells, stimulation of proliferation of activated b-lymphocytes, and induction of immunoglobulin secretion  <cit> . here, we identified widespread changes in the expression of mrnas in circulating blood cells that were obtained from animals with extreme levels of il <dig> production after in vitro stimulation. the pathways involved in cell growth and proliferation were over-expressed in the h group, probably in accordance with a higher capacity to induce proliferation of b cells. moreover, il- <dig> is an important t-cell growth factor and appears to be required for naïve cells to develop into th <dig> or th <dig> cells  <cit> .

apart from tgf-β and il- <dig>  il- <dig> is the most important cytokine with anti-inflammatory properties  <cit> . it is produced by almost all leukocyte types  <cit> , and regulates the functions of many different immune cells: release of immune mediators, antigen presentation and phagocytosis  <cit> . il- <dig> suppresses the functions of monocytes/macrophages that are responsible for both innate and specific immunities  <cit> . this agrees with our findings that animals with higher il <dig> levels presented a decreased expression of biological functions related to cellular immune response, antigen presentation and inflammatory response. more specifically, we observed a reduction in il <dig>  il- <dig>  and il-17a expression in animals with a high il <dig> production in agreement with the results of wolk et al. <cit> . since il- <dig> is also involved in preventing apoptosis of b cells by enhancing their proliferation and differentiation  <cit> , it was expected that growth and proliferation functions were over-expressed in animals with higher levels of il <dig> compared to those with lower levels.

the blood transcriptome of animals with an extreme phagocytic in vitro activity revealed a large number of genes that were differentially expressed. one important observation of this study was that animals that have a higher in vitro phagocytic activity also have an activated ctl4a signalling pathway. this signalling pathway is necessary for the negative regulation of t-cell activity following t-cell activation by antigen-presenting cells  <cit> . moreover, a strong relationship between blood phagocytosis and the stimulation of different interleukin pathways was detected, likely because cytokines are important mediators in the regulation of the immune and inflammatory responses. however, pathways associated with lxr/rxr activation were less expressed in animals with higher phagocytic activity. interestingly, while the transcriptional pathways that allow macrophages to recognize and respond to apoptotic cells are poorly defined, gonzalez et al. <cit>  reported that lxr signalling was important for both apoptotic cell clearance and maintenance of immune tolerance.

blood transcriptome provides information to refine in vivo measured its
for animals with extreme cd4-/cd8+ cell counts, transcriptome differences were shown to be the best predictors for phenotype variations compared to other its. the  <dig> annotated de genes captured around  <dig> % of the total variance. moreover, the most highly expressed genes in animals with different levels of cd4-/cd8+ were the perforin and cathepsin complex gene members , natural killer cell-related genes , chemokine receptor gene , cytokine ligands such as fas ligand tnf superfamily , as well as resolution of acute inflammation resolving exudates genes . there is evidence that gnly and gzmb are involved in the synthesis of granzymes  <cit> . saini et al. <cit>  reported that gnly and gzmb genes may play a role in the elimination of cells infected with viruses or other pathogens, tumour surveillance, and transplant rejection. faslg, an ifn-stimulated gene, has also been associated with cell death/apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells, and attack/killing of infected cells in pigs that recovered from a pestivirus infection  <cit> . moreover, marcolino et al. <cit>  and voehringer et al. <cit>  reported that the gene for klrg <dig>  which belongs to the family of inhibitory c-type lectins that are encoded in the nk gene complex, is expressed in healthy human peripheral blood cd <dig> and cd <dig> lymphocytes. interestingly, in pigs, it has been demonstrated that effector and memory cd4+ t cells express chemokine receptors such as cx3cr <dig>  <cit> . although the functions of these genes remain to be elucidated in pigs, our results suggest that the levels of different subsets of αβ t lymphocytes affect the expression of genes related to antigen presentation, phagocytosis and immunoregulation.

blood transcriptome as a source of gene biomarkers for it variation
the power of transcriptomics to identify potential gene biomarkers was previously demonstrated in classical studies on cancer, in which the analysis of gene expression signatures of primary tumours  <cit>  led to the identification of predictive outcome profiles  <cit> . most current strategies for the discovery of biomarkers involve a ‘top-down’ approach in which predictive genes are first identified by empirical association with a clinical symptom and are then evaluated as potential biomarkers for decision making  <cit> . in our study, the evaluation of potential biomarkers combined empirical association of gene expression with its and additional validation samples to demonstrate the accuracy and the reproducibility of the classifiers, using a multivariable analysis and a discrimination analysis approach. five genes  were among the most promising potential gene biomarkers . gnly, klrg <dig> and cx3cr <dig> genes were identified as potential gene biomarkers for the prediction of αβ t lymphocyte  counts. in humans, it has been shown that gnly expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells  is a biomarker for childhood and adolescent tuberculosis  <cit>  and for the diagnosis of serious bacterial infections  <cit> . cxcr <dig> is a highly selective chemokine receptor and surface marker for cytotoxic effector lymphocytes, and klrg <dig> is a surface marker used to predict the potential of cd <dig> effector t cells to differentiate into memory cells  <cit> . moreover, sherhan et al. <cit>  reported that alox <dig> is associated with the synthesis of eicosapentaenoic acid, an essential fatty acid that can be enzymatically converted into e-series resolvins during inflammation in mammals. understanding the mechanistic relationship and the biological meaning of these blood potential gene biomarkers is essential for future research.

blood transcriptome in healthy individuals as a source of relevant information for the prediction of immune traits
in humans and animals, blood is extensively monitored to follow health state, disease infection, and antibody production. in pigs, the blood transcriptome revealed variations in gene expression profiles in animals that differ in salmonella shedding levels  <cit> , and during the kinetics of response to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection  <cit> . analysis of the transcriptome of pbmcs has also revealed variations in gene expression profiles in response to in vitro stimulation by lipopolysaccharide  or phorbol myristate acetate -ionomycin   <cit> , vaccination with tetanus toxoid  <cit>  or in response to in vitro pseudorabies virus infection  <cit> . this study shows that, based on an experimental design that does not target a response to an infection or an immune stress, blood transcriptome profiling is a valid molecular approach to identify potential biomarkers and biological pathways related to the function of the immune system in healthy animals that harbour different levels of in vivo as well as in vitro its. additional studies will be necessary to ascertain dynamic changes that occur over time. in the future, it will be interesting to connect our results with those of a recent analysis on human blood transcriptome, that aimed at investigating the variations in gene expression in the blood of individuals within a population to predict the susceptibility to various environmental and living conditions  <cit> . indeed, healthy individuals were categorized into nine common clusters based on co-regulated transcripts in the blood  <cit> . each cluster was enriched for gene ontology categories related to subclasses of blood and immune functions. therefore, understanding how the blood transcriptome varies across the population, and not only in the extreme individuals of the population, and correlating this variability with specific immune functions, could be an emerging component of the prediction of immune responses in pigs. since cd4-/cd8+ and phagocytosis its are highly heritable in pigs  <cit>  and associated with the expression of different genes, it might be anticipated that a study that combines the levels of gene expression with genetic analyses could contribute to identify candidate genes underlying heritable immune response traits. more studies are necessary on the functional and biological validation of blood gene biomarkers in pigs in order to better understand their role in the immune system response. integration of information from various sources  should be a major trend in the future to better understand causalities and promote prediction capacity. lastly, since pig is an important biomedical model  <cit> , profiling the blood transcriptome could be highly relevant to understand the immune function in animals, but also in humans. recently, groenen et al. <cit>  highlighted the pig as a relevant biomedical model and dawson et al. <cit>  underlined the importance of the domestic pig as a model for human immunology since the two species share many pathogens.

CONCLUSIONS
peripheral blood represents an attractive tissue source because it is easily sampled and because of its potential as a sentinel tissue to monitor immunocompetence. our results demonstrate that the transcriptome of circulating blood cells varies between healthy pigs with extreme levels of in vitro production of il <dig> and il <dig>  phagocytic activity and cd4-/cd8+cell counts. furthermore, five transcriptional biomarkers were found to be good predictors for cd4-/cd8+ cell counts, il <dig> production, or phagocytic activity. therefore, new molecular strategies to phenotype immune traits in pigs could be launched based on blood genome-wide transcriptome or by targeting specific biomarkers.
