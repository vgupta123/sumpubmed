BACKGROUND
trichome patterning in arabidopsis is controlled by several different types of transcription factors. based on available evidence, it was proposed that an r2r <dig> myb-type transcription factor glabra <dig>   <cit> , a bhlh transcription factors glabra <dig>   <cit>  or enhancer of glabra <dig>   <cit> , and a wd40-repeat protein transparent testa glabra <dig>   <cit> , form an activator complex ttg1-gl3/egl3-gl <dig>  this activator complex activates the expression of glabra <dig> , which encodes a homeodomain protein that promotes trichome formation in shoots  <cit> . the same activator complex also induces the expression of some single-repeat r <dig> myb genes.

so far a total of six genes in the arabidopsis genome have been reported encoding single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors, including triptychon   <cit> , caprice   <cit> , trichomeless <dig>  <cit> , and enhancer of try and cpc <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <cit> . single-repeat myb transcription factors are characterized by their short sequence  and consist largely of the single myb domain  <cit> . single-repeat r <dig> mybs can move from a trichome precursor cell to its neighboring cells to block the formation of the activator complex by competing with gl <dig> in binding gl <dig> or egl <dig>  thus inhibiting trichome formation in shoots  <cit> . these single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors differ in their binding strength to gl <dig> and their capacity to compete with gl <dig> for binding gl <dig>  a yeast three-hybrid assays suggested that cpc is the most potent inhibitor followed by etc <dig>  try, etc <dig> and etc <dig>  <cit> . a protoplast transfection assay showed that tcl <dig> is stronger than cpc in their ability to bind gl <dig>  <cit> .

although over expressing any of these six single-repeat r <dig> transcription factors in arabidopsis causes a glabrous phenotype, single mutants of these genes have different phenotypes. mutation in try results in trichome cluster phenotype  <cit> , mutation in cpc increases trichome number  <cit> , and mutation in tcl <dig> causes ectopic trichome formation on inflorescence stems and pedicels  <cit> . mutation in etc <dig>  etc <dig> or etc <dig> does not dramatically affect trichome formation. however, analysis of double, triple and higher order mutants between these single mutants indicated that all six single-repeat myb transcription factors function in a highly redundant manner to control trichome formation in arabidopsis  <cit> .

in addition to competing with gl <dig> for binding gl <dig>  our previous results showed that tcl <dig> could also directly suppress the expression of gl <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, unlike many other single-repeat mybs, the expression of tcl <dig> is not controlled by the activator complex formed by gl <dig> and gl3/egl <dig>  recently, it has been found that microrna <dig> -targeted squamosa promoter binding protein like   <dig> can activate tcl <dig> and try expression through binding to their promoters  <cit> .

here we analyzed the role of trichomeless <dig> , a previously uncharacterized single-repeat myb transcription factor in trichome patterning in arabidopsis. we demonstrated that tcl <dig>  like other single-repeat mybs, negatively regulates trichome formation. overexpression of tcl <dig> conferred glabrous phenotype while knockdown of tcl <dig> via rnai induced ectopic trichome formation on inflorescence stems and pedicels, a phenotype that was previously observed in tcl <dig> mutants. furthermore we provide genetic evidence that tcl <dig> and tcl <dig> may not be fully functional equivalent. we also showed that mir <dig> is involved in the regulation of tcl <dig>  and spls may require co-activators to regulate the expression of their target genes, including tcl <dig>  try, and possibly, tcl <dig> 

RESULTS
trichomeless <dig> is closely related to tcl1
in arabidopsis, a total of six single-repeat myb transcription factors have been characterized so far  <cit> . in order to examine whether there is any uncharacterized single-repeat myb transcription factors, the entire amino acid sequence of tcl <dig> was used as a template to blast arabidopsis protein database . in addition to try, cpc, tcl <dig>  etc <dig>  etc <dig> and etc3/cpl <dig> that have been reported previously, our analysis revealed that this is another single-repeat myb transcription factor encoded by at2g <dig> in the arabidopsis genome. the gene encoding this uncharacterized single-repeat myb was designated trichomeless <dig> . tcl <dig> is nearby two other single-repeat myb genes, etc <dig> and tcl <dig>  on chromosome ii , with etc <dig> is a tandem repeat gene with tcl <dig>  while tcl <dig> and tcl <dig> is separated by another gene at2g <dig>  phylogenic analysis using full length protein sequences showed that tcl <dig> is closely related to tcl <dig> . tcl <dig> shares 80% identify with tcl <dig> at the amino acid level. as shown in figure 1c, like tcl <dig> and other single-repeat mybs, tcl <dig> also contains the conserved amino acid signature l ×  <dig>  ×  <dig> l ×  <dig> l × 3r that is required for the interaction with r/b-like bhlh transcription factors <cit>  and the conserved amino acids that have been shown to be required for the cell-to-cell movement of the single-repeat myb transcription factor cpc  <cit> .

expression and subcellular localization of tcl2
to characterize the function of tcl <dig>  we first examined the expression of tcl <dig> across various tissues and organs. we also compared the expression pattern of tcl <dig> with that of tcl <dig> because tcl <dig> is more closely related to tcl <dig> than other single-repeat mybs at the amino acid level. various tissues and organs of wild-type plants were harvested, and rt-pcr was used to examine the expression of tcl <dig> and tcl <dig>  we found that tcl <dig> is expressed in all tissues/organs tested except young siliques, where tcl <dig> is highly expressed . tcl <dig> is also highly expressed in cotyledons, organs that normally do not produce any trichomes and where the transcript of tcl <dig> was at undetectable level . to get more details about when, where and in response to what stimulus tcl <dig> is expressed, we then searched public available gene expression database genevestigator  using at2g <dig> as gene id, however, results showed that there is no probeset could be found for the gene id provided, possibly because tcl <dig> is previously unidentified gene, and no probes for this gene have been printed on microarrays used for all those experiments that provided data for the database.

to examine tcl2's subcellular localization, we generated transgenic plants expressing tcl2-gfp fusion protein under the control of tcl2's own promoter, a genomic dna fragment that covers the region - <dig> to + <dig> of the start codon of tcl <dig>  the transgenic plant produces reduced number of trichomes , a phenotype similar to that of ptcl1:tcl1-gfp transgenic plant  <cit> ,indicating that the reduction in trichome number is due to an increase on the copy number of the tcl <dig> gene, as overexpression of tcl <dig> showed a greatly reduced trichome phenotype . these results also indicate that both the tcl <dig> promoter and tcl2-gfp fusion protein are likely functional. by using the transgenic plants obtained, we showed that tcl2-gfp proteins are mainly observed in the nucleus of epidermal cells .

tcl <dig> is a negative regulator of trichome formation
to analyze the function of tcl <dig> in trichome formation, we generated transgenic plants overexpressing ha tagged tcl <dig> under the control of 35s promoter . transcript levels of tcl <dig> were examined by rt-pcr using ha-specific and tcl <dig> specific primers . as observed previously for all other single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factors, transgenic plants overexpressing tcl <dig> resulted in glabrous phenotypes, with no trichome formation on rosette leaves, inflorescence stems, cauline leaves or floral organs .

to further analyze the function of tcl <dig> in trichome formation, we sought loss-of-function alleles of tcl <dig>  by searching the salk t-dna express database, we found there are four t-dna insertion mutants that are related to tcl <dig>  however, in all those four lines, the t-dna was inserted in the promoter regions, and expression of tcl <dig> is largely unaffected as examined by rt-pcr . as a result, all the mutants have wild-type trichome phenotypes.

therefore, we took rnai approach to knock down the expression of tcl <dig>  since tcl2's orf fragment is relative small, only  <dig> bp in length, we used the full-length orf to create the rnai construct. we selected three independent transgenic lines displaying ectopic trichome formation on inflorescence stems and pedicels , similar to that of tcl <dig> mutant  <cit> . rt-pcr results showed that expression level of tcl <dig> in the transgenic lines was dramatically reduced , while expression of other single-repeat myb genes was largely unaffected , indicating that the phenotype observed is caused by down-expression of tcl <dig> 

when we quantified the number of trichomes on internodes and pedicels, we found that compared with tcl <dig> mutant, there are fewer internodes and pedicels bearing ectopic trichomes in tcl2rnai mutant .

tcl <dig> partially rescued tcl <dig> mutant trichome phenotypes
previously, we identified tcl <dig> as a major single-repeat myb transcription factor that negatively regulates trichome formation on the inflorescences and pedicels  <cit> . the tcl <dig> mutant confers ectopic trichome formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicels. here we showed that transgenic plants with reduced expression of tcl <dig> have similar phenotype as that of tcl <dig> . loss-of-function mutations in any other single-repeat mybs including try, cpc, etc <dig>  etc <dig>  and etc <dig> do not result in similar inflorescence and pedicel trichome phenotypes as shown in tcl <dig> mutant or tcl2rnai lines. therefore, we wanted to further examine the relationship between tcl <dig> and tcl <dig> in trichome formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicels. double mutant was generated between tcl <dig> and tcl2rnai mutants, however, the double mutant was indistinguishable from tcl <dig> single mutant , possibly because higher order redundancy function among single repeat genes  <cit> . therefore we turned to test if tcl <dig> could rescue tcl <dig> mutant phenotype. transgenic plants were generated to express tcl <dig> under the control of tcl <dig> promoter in a tcl <dig> background . our previous results have showed that expression of tcl1-gfp fusion protein under the control of tcl <dig> promoter fully rescued tcl <dig> trichome phenotype  <cit> , indicating that the tcl <dig> promoter used is fully functionally. as shown in figure  <dig>  expression of tcl <dig> protein under the tcl <dig> promoter only partially rescued tcl <dig> mutant phenotype, indicating that tcl <dig> is functionally similar but not identical to tcl <dig> in controlling trichome patterning on the inflorescence stems and pedicels.

tcl <dig> interacts with gl3
it has been proposed that single-repeat myb transcription factors control trichome formation by competing with gl <dig> for binding gl <dig>  thus blocking the formation of ttg1-gl3-gl <dig> activator complex. we have previously demonstrated that try, cpc, tcl <dig>  etc <dig>  etc <dig>  and etc <dig>  interact with gl <dig> using a protoplast transfection system  <cit> . to test if tcl <dig> controls trichome formation using a similar mechanism, we tested if tcl <dig> interacts with gl <dig> in plant cells.

a protoplast transient expression system was used to test the interaction between tcl <dig> and gl <dig>  a gal4-gus reporter, together with the effectors gl <dig> and a gal <dig> dna binding domain  fused tcl <dig>  were co-transfected into arabidopsis protoplasts. gd alone and gd-tcl <dig> were used as negative and positive control, respectively. as shown in figure 6a, with or without gl <dig>  gd alone could not activate the expression of the reporter gene. in the absence of gl <dig>  neither gd-tcl <dig> nor gd-tcl <dig> activated the expression of the reporter gene presumably due to the fact that single-repeat r <dig> transcription factors do not have activation domains. however, in the presence of gl <dig>  both gd-tcl <dig> and gd-tcl <dig> activated the reporter gene, indicating that tcl <dig> interacts with gl <dig> in plant cells. it should be noted that gl <dig> can function as a transcriptional activator, however, alone it cannot be recruited to the gal <dig> dna binding elements in the reporter gene  <cit> . it was also observed that the expression of the reporter gene activated by gd-tcl <dig> in the presence of gl <dig> is much higher than that of gd-tcl <dig> , implying that the binding affinity between tcl <dig> and gl <dig> may be higher than that between tcl <dig> and gl <dig> 

tcl <dig> suppresses the expression of gl1
in addition to competing with gl <dig> for binding gl <dig>  we also reported previously that tcl <dig> can directly suppress the expression of gl <dig>  <cit> . because tcl <dig> is more closely related to tcl <dig> than any other single-repeat mybs at the amino acid level  and tcl2rnai lines displayed similar inflorescence and pedicels trichome phenotypes as tcl <dig> mutants, we then tested if tcl <dig> also affects the expression of gl <dig>  as shown in figure 6b, expression level of gl <dig> is dramatically reduced in 35s:ha-tcl <dig> seedlings, similar to that in 35s:ha-tcl <dig> seedlings, suggesting that tcl <dig> can also suppress the expression of gl <dig> 

neither gl1-gl <dig> activator complex nor spls alone activates tcl2
available evidence suggested that ttg1-gl3-gl <dig> activator complex activates both gl <dig> and some single-repeat myb genes. our previous reporter showed that gl <dig> and gl <dig> are required and sufficient to activate gl <dig> and a subset of single-repeat myb genes including try, cpc, etc <dig> and etc <dig>  but not etc <dig> and tcl <dig> <cit> . to test if tcl <dig> is regulated by gl1-gl <dig> complex, gl <dig> and gl <dig> were co-transfected into protoplasts and rt-pcr was used to examine the expression of tcl <dig>  expression of cpc was used as a positive control. as expected, cpc was strongly induced by gl <dig> + gl <dig>  however, such activation was not observed for tcl <dig> .

we wanted to further investigate the molecular mechanism controlling the activation of tcl <dig> transcription. recently, it has been showed that tcl <dig> is directly activated by mir <dig> directed spls  <cit> . in order to explore the possibility that expression of tcl <dig> may also be controlled by mir <dig> directed spls, we tested the expression of tcl <dig> in 35s:mir <dig> plant. indeed, we found that the expression level of tcl <dig> in 35s:mir <dig> plant was dramatically reduced , similar to that of tcl <dig>  <cit> . to further test if spls can directly active tcl <dig>  we cloned five spl genes including spl <dig>  spl <dig>  spl <dig>  spl <dig> and spl <dig>  transiently expressed them in protoplasts, and then used rt-pcr to examine the expression of tcl <dig>  the five spls were chosen because all of them but spl <dig> have been shown to regulate trichome formation  <cit> , while spl <dig> is closely related to spl <dig>  <cit> . to our surprise, no significant changes were observed . since over-expression of spls in plants has already been shown to be able to induce the expression of tcl <dig>  and spl <dig> has been shown to directly bind to the promoter region of tcl <dig>  <cit> , we test if the expression of tcl <dig> in protoplasts transfected with spls is affected. however, we did not see any significant changes . these results suggested that spls alone may not be sufficient to activate the expression of tcl <dig>  to explore this possibility further, all five spls cloned were fused with gd and co-transfected with gal4:gus reporter gene into protoplasts, then gus activities were assays. indeed, none of the five spls tested could activate the reporter gene . these results indicated that although spls can bind directly to the promoter region of tcl <dig>  they might require co-activators to regulate the expression of their target genes, including tcl <dig>  try and possibly, tcl <dig> 

discussion
tcl <dig> is a negative regulator of trichome formation
in this study we analyzed the function of tcl <dig>  a previously uncharacterized single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factor in trichome formation in arabidopsis. we showed that tcl <dig>  like tcl <dig>  try, cpc, etc <dig>  etc <dig> and etc <dig>  act as a negative regulator for trichome formation. overexpression of tcl <dig> under the control of the camv 35s promoter resulted in a glabrous phenotype . knockdown of tcl <dig> via rnai  resulted in ectopic trichome formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicels , while the number and patterning of trichomes on leaves were largely unaffected, a phenotype similar to that of tcl <dig>  <cit> . these results suggest that tcl <dig> negatively regulates trichome formation and that tcl <dig> may have overlapping function with tcl <dig> in controlling trichome formation on the inflorescence stems and pedicels.

we also showed that expression of tcl <dig> under the control of the tcl <dig> promoter in a tcl <dig> mutant background  could only partially rescue the trichome phenotype of the tcl <dig> mutant. trichomes were still present on the inflorescence stems and pedicels of ptcl1:tcl2/tcl <dig> plants, although the frequency was significantly reduced . on the other hand, expression of tcl <dig> under the control of the tcl <dig> promoter in tcl <dig> mutant background fully rescued the trichome phenotype of the tcl <dig> mutant  <cit> . these results implied that tcl <dig> and tcl <dig> may function redundantly to control trichome development on inflorescence stems and pedicels but their function may not fully interchangeable.

although transcript of tcl <dig> is detectable in roots , all the mutants tested including tcl <dig> overexpressor, tcl2rnai and ptcl1:tcl2/tcl <dig> are largely indistinguishable from wild type in term of root hair formation . however, we could not rule out the possibility that tcl <dig> may play a role in regulating root hair formation, a higher order combination of mutations in single repeat mybs may help clarify the exact role of tcl <dig> in root formation.

how does tcl <dig> regulate trichome formation
previous research has pointed out that trichome formation is regulated by an activator/inhibitor feedback system  <cit> . ttg <dig>  gl <dig>  and gl <dig> or egl <dig> form an activator complex  that initiates trichome development by activating gl <dig>  the same activator complex also activates some single-repeat r <dig> myb transcription factor genes, whose products, in turn, compete with gl <dig> for binding gl3/egl <dig>  thus inhibiting the formation of the activator complex. our previous study suggested that tcl <dig> could also directly suppress the expression of gl <dig>  providing another negative feedback loop on the regulation of trichome formation  <cit> . by using a protoplast transfection system, we showed that tcl <dig> interacts with gl <dig> , suggesting that tcl <dig> could block the formation of the activator complex required for trichome formation . rt-pcr results showed that expression of gl <dig> is dramatically reduced in the plants overexpressing ha-tcl <dig>  indicating the tcl <dig> can also suppress the expression of gl <dig>  these results suggest that tcl <dig> negatively regulate trichome formation in a manner similar to that of tcl <dig> . however, we could not rule out the possibility that tcl <dig> may also regulate trichome formation through other mechanisms, since our recent results showed that single-repeat mybs may regulate trichome formation independent of gl <dig>  <cit> .

regulation of tcl2
available evidence supports that ttg1-gl3/egl3-gl <dig> activator complex plays an important role in regulating trichome formation. recently, several phytohormones, such as jasmonic acid , gibberellins  and cytokinins are found to be involved in the promotion of trichome formation, and this promotion is mediated, at least in part, by transcriptional regulation of the components of ttg1-gl3/egl3-gl <dig> complex  <cit> , providing further support for the critical role of the activator complex in the regulation of trichome formation. in addition to regulating the expression of gl <dig> to promote trichome formation, the activator complex also activates some single-repeat myb genes to provide a negative feedback loop. available evidence suggested that the transcription of cpc, try, etc <dig>  and etc <dig>  but not tcl <dig> and etc <dig>  is regulated by the proposed activator complex  <cit> , implying that other pathways may also be involved in the regulation of single-repeat myb genes. recently, it has been showed that mir156-regulated spls, which promote phase transition, directly activate tcl <dig> and try expression through binding to their promoters and that this activation is independent of gl <dig> <cit> .

using protoplast transient expression system, we found that the expression of tcl <dig> is not regulated by ttg1-gl3/egl3-gl <dig> complex . reduced expression of tcl <dig> in 35s:mir <dig> transgenic plants suggested that mir156-targeted spls may also regulate the expression of tcl <dig> . however, when expressed in protoplasts, none of the five spls tested could induce the expression of neither tcl <dig> nor tcl <dig>  further test suggested that spls alone could not activate reporter gene expression when recruited to the promoter region of the reporter gene by a fused dna binding domain. these results indicated that there might be other co-activator working together with spls to regulate the expression of tcl <dig>  and possible tcl <dig> . it is also possible that unidentified targets of mir <dig> may involve in the regulation of single-repeat myb genes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this report, we identified tcl <dig> as a new member of single-repeat myb transcription factor family, and provided evidence to show that tcl <dig> is a negative regulator of trichome development. we showed that tcl <dig> may have overlapping function with tcl <dig> to regulate trichome formation, but its function is not fully interchangeable with tcl <dig>  furthermore, we showed that tcl <dig> interact with gl <dig> in plant cells, its expression is not regulated by gl3/gl <dig> activator complex, and that mir <dig> is involved in the regulation of tcl <dig>  finally, we found that although spls can bind directly to the promoter region of tcl <dig>  they likely require co-activators to regulate the expression of their target genes, including tcl <dig>  try, and possibly, tcl <dig>
