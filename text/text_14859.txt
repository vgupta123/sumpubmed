BACKGROUND
during the last few years a surge in information on mitochondrial dna control region sequence has been observed along with information from coding region substitutions in diverse populations of the world to understand their genetic diversity, structuring and origins  <cit> . more recently, mt dna sequence data has been used to explore the peopling of asia and to comprehend various population demographic parameters  <cit> . from a human genetics perspective india assumes importance in asia because  the extensive diversity of populations residing in the sub-continent, which are biologically and culturally differentiated among themselves,  a clear distinction exists between non-tribal and tribal populations, autochthonous to the sub-continent  <cit> , lastly and more importantly this expanse is believed to be one of the early regions of settlement of modern humans  <cit> . of the four major matrilines identified till date l, m, n and r, about 60% of indians trace their maternal roots in indian specific branches of haplogroup m that is reported to have emerged from the african haplogroup l <dig>  with the exception of the m <dig> lineage that is confined to ethiopia  <cit> , all the other branches of this macrohaplogroup including m*, c, d, g, e and z haplogroups are observed in asia  <cit> . the lineages m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> are exclusive to india, with m <dig> reported to be the most ancient lineage in the sub-continent with an age estimation of  <dig>  yrs- <dig>  yrs. furthermore, the frequencies of these clades among the different geographic, linguistic phyla and social strata have been investigated in detail, yet the fundamental question regarding origin of this super-haplogroup still remains unanswered  <cit> . while some authors have suggested a southwest asian origin of m macrohaplogroup, followed by a back migration to africa  <cit> , others support its african ancestry  <cit> . one major drawback in arriving to a conclusion is the limitation of control region sequences in providing reliable estimate of phylogeny owing to homoplasy and recurrent mutations  <cit> .

complete mitochondrial genome sequencing has gained importance in resolving phylogenies and understanding human evolution. extensive genome sequencing studies have been carried out in different lineages of l, n and m major- haplogroups across different global populations. though the phylogenies of east asian counter parts of m lineages: m <dig>  m8a, m8c, m8z, m <dig>  e, d, g have been resolved in detail, but till date no similar studies have been attempted on the sub-lineages of the indian m haplogroup  <cit> . the complete mt dna sequence information from indian m lineages will not only help answer questions regarding the origin and antiquity of this haplogroup, and resolving the phylogeny to finer branches but would also be highly relevant in understanding various parameters of population genetics, mitochondrial disorders and disease diagnosis and to some extent in forensic work .

the present study was undertaken to construct an unambiguous phylogeny for the m macrohaplogroup and to estimate its antiquity. mitochondrial genomes were initially classified on the basis of their hvsi and coding region motifs, followed by complete sequencing of twenty-three samples representing different m matrilineals.

RESULTS
we have found seven group defining basal substitutions and described fourteen lineages in detail from complete mt dna genome sequence information, which would be helpful in further resolving some of the indian m lineages. the m trunk differs from revised cambridge reference sequence  with substitutions at a73g, a263g, t489c, a750g, a2706g, a1438g, a4769g, c7028t, a8701g, a8860g, t9540c, a10398g, c10400t, t10873c, g11719a, c12705t, c14766t, t14783c, g15043a, g15301a, a15326g and c16223t. the coding region mutation sites analyzed in the present study were different from those observed in the sister m <dig> lineage found in ethiopia. the m phylogenetic tree constructed on whole mt sequence information of twenty four samples belonging to different m lineages and their sub-types including m <dig>  m <dig>  m2a, m2b, m <dig>  m30a, m <dig>  m*, m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig> is provided in figure  <dig> 

m <dig> lineage
the complete sequencing of five mt dna genomes belonging to m <dig> and its sub-lineages, m2a and m2b, indicated that coding region mutations t477c, t1780c, a8502g were associated with hvsi motifs c16223t and g16319a, which formed the root of m <dig> lineages. in case of m2a, we report a novel basal substitution at site t9758c in addition to previously reported transitions at g5252a and a8396g. screening of t9758c site in twenty seven indian individuals possessing m2a specific hvsi and coding region motifs, clearly establishes this mutation as a marker of this sub-lineage. the m2b sub-lineage having hvsi motif g16274a and t16357c, in addition to m <dig> defining mutations sites did not share any coding region substitutions with m2a. overall, m <dig> lineage presents the maximum number of coding region mutation sites than any other analyzed lineage in this study.

m <dig> lineage
a new lineage m <dig> was recognized in the m macrohaplogroup, comprising of seven mt genomes, six of whose hvsi motifs did not correspond to any of the earlier established m lineages and one that was recently identified as m <dig> lineage . since lineages of m have already been catalogued from m <dig> to m <dig>  this potential new lineage is designated as m <dig> to avoid any ambiguity in classification of m macrohaplogroup. this branch arises from the main m trunk with transition at site g12007a. finer resolution of this lineage was achieved by further clustering four complete sequences with mutation at two sites, t195a and g15431a into a sub-lineage designated as m30a. a total of eighteen indian individuals belonged to m30a lineage. three mt dna genomes further branched out from m <dig> lineage, possessing only g12007a substitution. interestingly, the newly described m <dig>  matriline is one of the branches that directly emerged from m <dig> lineage. sequence analysis of ten m <dig> mt dna genomes showed the presence of g12007a transition. eighteen indian individuals were identified from our mtdna database as possessing a hvsi motif  similar to the saora sample, which arose as an offshoot of m <dig> lineage. all eighteen individuals tested positive for g12007a transition, suggesting that it might be acceptable to place m <dig> under m <dig> lineage.

m <dig> lineage
the basal motif t12477c, g16129a and c16223t describes m <dig> lineage of majorhaplogroup m. whole genome sequencing of three samples with similar hvsi motif, g16129a and c16223t, revealed that only one sample  exhibited the t12477c mutation, and designated as m5a sub-lineage . this site was nevertheless absent in the other two samples, one of which had a similar hvsi motif as m5a mt dna genome, while the other exhibited an additional site g16048a in its control region motif. our study identifies a transversion at c10986a, shared by all the three samples, suggesting that these sequence types branched out from a common root. analysis of c10986a substitution in seven indian samples possessing hvsi motif, g16048a, g16129a and c16223t, confirms our finding that different branches emerged from m <dig> lineage. it is, however, important to note that g16129a might not be important in defining m <dig> and c10986a marker remains confined to this lineage until tested in a sufficiently large number of undefined m*samples.

m <dig> lineage
the m <dig> lineage has been recently described by the presence of g15928a and t16304c. it differs from the m halogroup by five coding region substitutions and arises directly from the m trunk with no additional group defining motifs.

m <dig> lineage
the present analysis defines another new lineage that emerged from the main trunk of m macrohaplogroup, with a substitution at a5319g. keeping in succession with the numbering of lineages, we designate this lineage as m <dig>  this branch comprises of the previously well-defined m <dig> lineage along with m <dig> and m <dig> lineages.

the two m <dig> matrilines completely sequenced, harbor the characteristic group defining mutations at site t16231c, t16362c and c3539t. our analysis deciphered another novel substitution at site a5301g in this lineage.

whole sequencing of two m <dig> genomes  demonstrated a lack of similarity in their coding region substitutions. since both t16126c and c16311t are fast mutating sites, we propose the non-existence of m <dig> and m <dig> lineages in the m phylogeny.

three mt dna genomes could not be differentiated in the study and were left designated as m*. one of the m* genomes was previously characterized as m <dig> lineage and differed in its coding region substitutions from the other m <dig>  currently placed under m <dig> lineage. the matrilineal type possessing c16223t and t16325c as hvsi motif has been observed in relatively high frequency in indian populations. contrary to our expectation, full sequencing of this mt dna , did not exhibit the presence of g12007a mutation site that was observed in other unidentified m lineages analyzed in this study. similar results were observed after complete sequencing of the hvsi motif type c16223t and c16251t.

the newly described phylogeny based on twenty-three indian specific mt dna sequence information radiates from the trunk of m macrohaplogroup with limited number of branches, differing in their basal motifs with one or more coding region substitutions. the branching pattern displayed by m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> and their sub-lineages mirrors the expansion model, indicating that most of the lineages described on basis of their control region sequence, occupy peripheral positions of the phylogeny. m <dig> is estimated to be the oldest lineage with an age of  <dig> +/-  <dig>  years before present . furthermore, sub-lineage m2a differs from m <dig> by a minimum of six coding region substitutions, reiterating the antiquity of m <dig>  the newly defined m <dig> and m <dig> lineages differ from the root of m by six to eight substitutions and hence, display similar expansion ages of approximately  <dig> +/-  <dig>  ybp.

discussion
analysis of short stretches of mt dna hvsi and hvsii region have significantly aided in clearly discriminating some of the m lineages. with the aim of understanding migration routes of diverse indian people, more control region sequences are being generated without much support from coding region sites, resulting in an increasing number of conflicts within the classification of its lineages. we report a phylogenetic tree constructed from the whole genome sequencing of twenty-three indian and one ethiopian m lineage to resolve some of the anomalies occurring due to recurrent mutations in control region.

the control region sequences have exhibited the presence of an array of m lineages in india  <cit> , despite which, complete mt dna sequencing suggests that most of these lineages arose as limited offshoots of the main m trunk. the newly constructed m phylogeny displays difference in the branching patterns of lineages, with total number of substitution sites varying even within a lineage. substantial variation in branch length within a lineage is indicative of the existence of further branching that could probably be delineated with generation of additional data. the m <dig> genome and its sub-lineages, more specifically m2a, have been well described in indian population. nevertheless complete sequencing of m2a demonstrated the presence of a novel site t9758c, which is characterized as a diagnostic marker for m2a sub-lineage, in addition to the previous reported, g5252a and a8396g transitions  <cit> . this finding reinforces the importance of sequencing a large number of individuals belonging to a lineage for describing a detailed phylogeny. the study was unable to trace any specific marker for m2b sub-lineage. in the absence of any lineage specific marker for m2b till date, it might be suggested that this sub-lineage is not a distinct clade of m <dig> lineage but is an m <dig> with additional hvsi motif . however, more m2b genomes need to be completely sequenced before reaching this conclusion and though hvsi sequences are not very reliable for constructing phylogenies, this cluster can well differentiate individuals with only one or both mutations and in turn resolve the phylogeny to its finer sub-lineages. m <dig> lineage is the oldest m lineage found in india with an estimated age of approximately  <dig>  ybp, using only coding region motifs estimation, opposed to the expansion date of  <dig> – <dig>  yrs calculated from control region sequence information  <cit> .

although the g12007a substitution has been previously identified in other haplogroups, besides the m lineages  <cit> , this study presents a novel lineage m <dig> that was differentiated to include mitochondrial genomes possessing g12007a substitution. the erection of m30a sub-lineage with its root at t195a and g15431a may help in further classifying m* samples that have yet to be identified owing to the absence of any characteristic hvsi motif.

mitochondrial genomes possessing the  <dig>   <dig> motif appear to be a promising new sub-lineage arising from m <dig>  additional complete mtdna sequencing of similar sub-types may further help in precisely defining this branch. the m <dig> lineage was relatively younger than the m <dig> lineage with an expansion age of approximately  <dig>  ybp, calculated on the basis of its coding region sequence information.

an important contribution of this study is placement of m <dig>  m <dig> and previously defined m <dig> and m <dig> lineages in the m phylogeny. in the absence of a coding region marker for m <dig> lineage  <cit> , g12007a substitution provides a stable root to m <dig> type, which is defined only on basis of the hvsi motif a16318t. the recognition of m <dig> lineage with an a5319g basal transition further reduces the number of branches arising from the trunk of m lineage. since m <dig> is already well characterized, we propose that it remain as a sub-lineage of m <dig>  however, it is essential that previously defined m <dig> and m <dig> lineages be completely removed from the phylogeny. furthermore, it might be realized that the newly defined m4a lineage  <cit> , might in fact be a sub-lineage or independent lineage by itself.

the m phylogenetic tree has largely aided in resolving the position of m <dig> lineage. until recently, transition at g16129a along with basal motif of m, was used to characterize this lineage  <cit>  and is currently described by the presence of coding region mutation at t12477c  <cit> . the phylogenetic tree constructed on the basis of complete mt dna genome sequencing provides evidence to support our finding that at least two sub-lineages arise from m <dig> that share a transversion at site c10986a and may or may not possess t12477c transition. presence of t12477c transition in only one of the two m <dig> mt dna genomes sharing an identical hvsi motif, c16223t and g16129a, further substantiates the importance of coding region markers in precisely identifying mitochondrial phylogenies. even though g16048a, hvsi motif has not been included under m <dig> owing to absence of t12477c, this study includes this motif under m <dig> lineage. however, prior to defining g16048a, g16129a and c16223t cluster, it is imperative that more samples representing this hvsi motif be completely sequenced. the age of m <dig> lineage is estimated to be  <dig> +/-  <dig>  ybp, indicating that m <dig> and its sister lineages m <dig> and m <dig> probably branched out from m haplogroup around the same time.

the newly defined m <dig> lineage did not share mutation sites with any other lineage and independently arose from m trunk with g15928a and t16304c substitutions.

the moderately high frequency of c16223t, t16325c hvsi motif types in indian samples suggests that there might be a potential new lineage, which might be more accurately described once additional genomes possessing this motif are fully sequenced. in the absence of this sequence information, no attempt was made to classify this sequence type in to a lineage and hence, designated as m*. the other m* lineages bearing the control region motif, c16223t, t16126c and c16223t, c16251t, c16267t could not be resolved further for similar reasons.

although, this study presents only a preliminary view of the m phylogeny, yet the emerging data may be highly useful in resolving the long-standing debate on asian origin of m macrohaplogroup. since m macrohaplogroup is derived from l <dig>  which finds its roots in east africa, it is believed that presence of m <dig> in ethiopia further substantiates an african origin of m. a similar hypothesis had been drawn for the u <dig> lineage that is autochthonous to north africa although u haplogroup displays its maximum diversity in near east  <cit> . the authors of this study prepared an in-depth phylogeography of u <dig> to infer a back migration of this lineage from west asia to north africa. in the absence of a detailed m <dig> phylogeny, we have focused our attention on m <dig> to estimate the place of split of m from l <dig> as africa or asia. interestingly, a single m <dig> genome differs in its coding region from the root of m at ten sites as compared to m <dig>  which possess only four substitutions. also, sub-lineages of m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> show long branch lengths, highlighting the deep roots of these lineages. considering the antiquity of m <dig> and other east asian specific m lineages  <cit> , ethiopian m <dig> lineage is by far a relatively newer branch. our study on m <dig> and m <dig> mitochondrial genomes clearly established the asian origin of m macrohaplogroup, followed by a back migration to africa. we further suggest that as more m <dig> mt dna genomes are sequenced, there is a possibility that this lineage might find its root in one of the peripheral branches of asian m lineage.

CONCLUSIONS
this study presents the, first ever, phylogenetic tree constructed for the m lineages predominant in india. the phylogenetic tree emerged from the present study consists of seven branches. a significant achievement of this endeavor is the recognition of m <dig> and m <dig> lineages, which encompass seven and three sub-lineages respectively. while the previously defined lineages, m <dig> and m <dig> are now found to be sub-lineages of m <dig> and m31; our study suggests the non-existence of m <dig> and m <dig> as independent lineages. thus, the present analysis also determines the roots of few previously undefined mt dna genomes, reinforcing the importance of screening lineage defining coding region substitutions before describing a lineage. another significant conclusion emerged from this study is substantiating the asian origin hypothesis of m macrohaplogroup. this study would provide baseline information for precisely describing the macrohaplogroup m, as more complete mt dna sequence information is generated. furthermore, it establishes the superfluousness of control region diversity reported in the m macrohaplogroup by suggesting that most of m lineages might in fact be derived from limited basal branches.
