BACKGROUND
gene annotation is often done by alignment of mrnas to genome sequences. compared to ab initio gene finding  <cit> , this method is more reliable and avoids the need for training. the primary limitation is that not every gene will have an mrna, but this problem will diminish as the databases grow, even if it never completely disappears. for intra-species alignments, there are many successful algorithms like blat  <cit>  and sim <dig>  <cit> . they are known for their specificity and speed, even in mammalian-sized genomes, but they do not have the sensitivity that is needed for inter-species alignments. other algorithms like genewise  <cit>  do have the requisite sensitivity, but they are extremely slow. hence, we developed a new algorithm called cat  to combine the specificity and speed of the best intra-species algorithms with the sensitivity of the best inter-species algorithms.

from a technical perspective, there are three issues. first, sequence comparisons can be made at nucleotide or protein level. examples of the former are blat, sim <dig>  est_genome  <cit> , and exonerate  <cit> , while examples of the latter are exonerate-aa and genewise. although it is believed that protein comparisons are intrinsically better at detecting distant homologies, we will show that this need not be the case. the real difference is that protein comparisons are better at determining exon-intron boundaries, since they can incorporate phase information. however, for aligning non-coding un-translated regions , nucleotide comparisons are the only option. the second issue has to do with the tradeoffs between dynamic programming  and heuristic methods. a full dp implementation like est_genome and genewise is good for specificity and sensitivity, but not for speed. heuristic methods have been developed to increase the speed, often with a sacrifice in specificity and/or sensitivity, although as we will show, this too need not be the case. blast  <cit>  is a well-known example, but blat, sim <dig>  exonerate, and exonerate-aa also qualify. such methods are most readily applied to nucleotide comparisons. the third issue is a consequence of the fact that one must allow for frequent gaps and mismatches to accommodate distant homologies in inter-species alignments; but in doing so, one increases the likelihood of false alignments. these typically appear as poorly matched terminal exons, a long distance from the end of the true alignment, and must be removed by statistical rules.

cat is a nucleotide level alignment tool that uses improved heuristics to effectively balance specificity, sensitivity, and speed. it is designed for both intra-species and inter-species alignments. cat can be freely downloaded at the website .

RESULTS
programs and test data set
we benchmarked cat  against the following algorithms: blat , sim <dig> , genewise , est_genome , exonerate and exonerate-aa . two comparisons were done. first, we aligned mouse mrnas to human genome sequences, and then zebrafish mrnas to human genome sequences. all the sequence data, including mrnas, exon coordinates and genomes, were taken from the ucsc genome browser  <cit>  . some of the mrnas were flagged by ucsc because they mapped to more than one locus, and these were discarded. ortholog relations came from homologene  <cit>  . to ensure that we know what the "correct" answer is, we required all our human genes to have a mrna in refseq  <cit>  . the final data set had  <dig>  mouse-human and  <dig>  zebrafish-human gene pairs.

definition of performance
the exact human mrna coordinates, or alignments, on the human genome were given by ucsc. we arbitrarily took these alignments as the reference alignments, expecting most of them and their exon junctions could be recovered by aligning mouse  orthologous mrnas against the human genome. although orthologous mrnas in different species may differ at a few exons for a particular mrna, a good overall agreement on the  <dig>  orthologous pairs must indicate the good performance of a program. this is the basic assumption in our benchmark.

when we know what the correct answer is, performance can then be evaluated in the traditional manner  <cit> . we define true positive , false positive , and false negative  at the nucleotide level as follows.

tp = number of aligned bases that overlap with the orthology annotation

fp = number of aligned bases that do not overlap with the orthology annotation

fn = number of bases in the orthology annotation that remain unaligned

at the nucleotide level, sensitivity  and specificity  are the proportion of correctly aligned bases with respect to the known and predicted alignment, respectively.

where an exon is said to be correctly aligned, if and only if the known alignment  and predicted one  match end-to-end, which means the exon boundaries are identical between them.

depending on the circumstances, we compute sensitivity and specificity in two ways, counting only the coding region  or counting the entire transcript .

comparison of algorithms
in our first set of measurements, we assume that each alignment can be localized to the orthologous region for that mrna. all algorithms show comparably good specificities regardless of sequence divergence levels . cat, est_genome, and genewise are the only ones that also show good sensitivities at the lowest cds identities. if we insist that utrs be included, then cat and est_genome are by far the best algorithms. although sim <dig> is the fastest , cat is part of a group of moderately fast algorithms that includes blat, exonerate, and exonerate-aa. in contrast, est_genome and genewise are extremely slow, since they are the only ones to implement a full dp algorithm.

the ''correct'' answers, against which we judge these algorithms, are based on an alignment of human mrnas from refseq to the sequence of the human genome, as annotated in the ucsc browser.

however, it is not sufficient to require that the orthologous regions can be identified in a negligible amount of time. for annotation purposes, mrnas must be aligned to mammalian-sized chromosomes in a reasonable amount of time. of the studied algorithms, cat, blat, and sim <dig> are the only ones where this condition is satisfied, but of these, only cat can handle inter-species comparisons. cat and blat are truly exceptional because their execution times scale nearly linearly with the size of the targeted genome sequences . all of the other algorithms scale very poorly with increasing size.

discussion
cat is accelerated mainly in two ways. firstly, cat loads about  <dig> mrnas in one batch and scans genome once. although the operations performed in scanning the genome are simple, doing these operations on a  <dig> gb genome for  <dig> times still amounts to a lot of computing time. cat avoids unnecessary scans of genomes. secondly, cat chains high-scoring segment pairs  localized in a window instead of on a whole chromosome. this allows cat to find multiple hits on a chromosome and reduces the time spent on chaining. for sim <dig>  chaining all the hsps on a whole chromosome is the bottleneck of its speed.

cat improves the sensitivity by using the techniques implemented in several previous softwares. non-contiguous seeds  <cit> , appropriate scoring matrix  <cit>  and 2-round seeding  <cit>  all help to achieve this goal. it is worth noting that localizing an mrna to the top five windows may cause some true alignments to be missing. fortunately, this happens rarely according to our practical observation in human-mouse alignments. for diverged species, this problem can also be largely avoided by retaining top  <dig> or more windows.

cat uses a simple statistical test to improve the specificity in genome-wide alignments. as a matter of fact, most of false alignments are extremely short and poorly aligned. they typically appear at the first or last few exons. these false fragments are mainly due to random matches in seed finding, in cases where the true match is too divergent to be detected at our default thresholds. only keeping statistically significant terminal exons, cat is able to rule out most of false alignments.

as a rule, speed and sensitivity are in conflict with each other. alignment algorithms must make a suitable compromise. our data show that cat sensitivity is competitive with algorithms like est_genome and genewise, which are based on a full dynamic programming implementation. the advantage is that cat is much faster. it is not as fast as blat and sim <dig>  but neither of these algorithms can compete with cat on sensitivity. as to the utility of cat for gene annotation, the reality of large-scale production projects is that mrna sequencing cannot keep up with genome sequencing. in vertebrates, genome sequences have been released for human, chimpanzee, rhesus, mouse, rat, dog, chicken, tetraodon, and fugu. many more are 'in the pipeline'. but, only in human  <cit> , and especially in mouse  <cit> , is there anything approaching a comprehensive collection of mrna sequences. this discrepancy can be attributed to the intrinsic difficulty of extracting fresh mrnas from the full complement of tissues, under all possible developmental and physiological conditions. more generally, for many genes in many species, the only mrnas will probably be from another species. cat therefore fulfills a need for practical gene annotation.

CONCLUSIONS
existing intra-species alignment algorithms, like blat and sim <dig>  have relatively low sensitivity, while existing inter-species alignment tools, like genewise, fail to process sequences in a high-throughput style.

cat offers an improved process that aligns mrna sequences to mammalian-sized genomes. with respect to the performance of alignment, it achieves a winning combination of the specificity and speed of the best intra-species algorithms, like blat and sim <dig>  with the sensitivity of the best inter-species tools, like genewise. given how large-scale production of mrna sequences tends to lag behind large-scale production of genome sequences, and how for certain genes the only available mrnas are from another species, cat fulfills a growing need for reliable genome annotation rooted in the experimental evidence of a real transcript.
