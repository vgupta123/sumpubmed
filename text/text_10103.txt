BACKGROUND
the hallmark of brain inflammation is the activation of glia, particularly microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain  <cit> . microglia activation in brain pathologies, as caused by infectious diseases, inflammation, trauma, brain tumors, ischemia and aids, may result in neuronal injury and ultimately neurodegeneration  <cit> . similar to other tissue macrophages, when microglia become activated they release potentially neurotoxic mediators  <cit> , followed by sublethal and lethal injury to the central nervous system. the two different phenotypic forms of microglia, namely the activated but nonphagocytic microglia found in inflammatory pathologies and the reactive or phagocytic microglia present in trauma, infection and neuronal degeneration, appear to have the capacity to express cell-surface receptors and release mediators of inflammation, such as cytokines, coagulation factors, complement factors, proteases, nitric oxide, eicosanoids and reactive oxygen species  <cit> .

over the last three decades, the marine environment has been demonstrated to be a source of novel therapeutic agents, many of which have anti-inflammatory properties  <cit> . we have previously shown that selected marine natural products modulate eicosanoids  <cit>  and o2- generation from activated rat  <cit>  and human neutrophils  <cit> , as well as liver  <cit>  and alveolar macrophages  <cit> . based on these observations we hypothesized that selected marine natural products might potentially attenuate activated brain microglia  <cit> . since the discovery by sakai and higa that the marine sponge-derived manzamine a  had potent antitumor activity  <cit> , there has been a sustained interest in the chemistry  <cit>  as well as the pharmacology of the manzamines, a class of β-carboline marine-derived alkaloids. more than  <dig> manzamine-type alkaloids have been isolated from  <dig> different genera of marine sponges from the indian and pacific oceans, and in addition to the antitumor activity  <cit> , manzamines have been shown to be immunostimulatory  <cit> , insecticidal  <cit> , antibacterial <cit> , antimalarial  <cit> , antiparasitic  <cit> , antiviral  <cit>  and to possess antituberculosis activity  <cit> .

in preliminary communications we have reported that mza, isolated from the okinawan marine sponge haliclona sp., potently inhibited txb <dig> and o2- generation by activated rat neonatal microglia while showing very low concomitant toxicity  <cit> . we now extend these previous communications by reporting the results of a structure-activity relationship study with manzamines a, b, c, d, e and f on agonist-stimulated release of o2- and txb <dig> from lps-activated rat neonatal microglia.

RESULTS
effect of manzamine a on lps-activated neonatal brain microglia txb <dig>  o2- and ldh release
as shown in fig.  <dig>  mza has a pentacyclic diamine group attached to the β-carboline moiety and it was tested as its hydrochloride salt. as is shown in fig. 2a, mza potently inhibited pma-stimulated txb <dig> generation , with a maximum  <dig>  % inhibition observed at  <dig> μm . furthermore, as depicted in fig. 3a, mza inhibited pma-stimulated o2- generation with an apparent ic <dig> =  <dig>  μm . significantly, increasing mza concentrations to  <dig> μm resulted in o2- inhibition of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  %, p <  <dig> , n =  <dig> 

in contrast, as shown in fig. 2a, the effect of mza on opz-stimulated txb <dig> generation was weaker , with a maximum  <dig> % inhibition at  <dig> μm . similarly, as depicted in fig 3a, mza did not appear to affect opz-stimulated o2- generation even at  <dig> μm .

as shown in fig. 2a and 3a, the cytotoxicity of mza to neonatal brain microglia measured as ldh release was not significantly different from controls even at  <dig> μm . this data suggests that the effect of mza on both pma-stimulated txb <dig> and o2- may be of a pharmacological nature.

effect of manzamine b on lps-activated neonatal brain microglia txb <dig>  o2- and ldh release
mzb differs from mza in having a tetracyclic diamine complex and an epoxide ring system . as shown in fig. 2b, mzb which was tested as a free base, was less potent than mza in affecting pma-stimulated txb <dig> generation . mzb  <dig> μm reduced txb <dig> release to  <dig>  % of control . similarly, as depicted in fig. 3b, mzb was less potent than mza in affecting pma-stimulated o2- generation . mzb  <dig> μm reduced o2- release to  <dig> % of control .

as shown in fig. 2b, mzb affected opz-stimulated txb <dig>  more than mza. mzb  <dig> μm reduced txb <dig> generation to  <dig>  % of control . furthermore, as shown in fig. 3b, mzb reduced opz-stimulated o2- generation  more than mza. mzb  <dig> μm reduced o2- generation to  <dig>  % of control .

as shown in fig. 2b and 3b, in contrast to mza, mzb was cytotoxic to neonatal brain microglia at concentrations above  <dig> μm. in fact, considerable ldh release was observed at  <dig> μm . taken together, these data suggest that the reduction of both o2- and txb <dig> generation resulted from both pharmacological and toxic effects of mzb on lps-activated microglia cells.

effect of manzamine c on lps-activated neonatal brain microglia txb <dig>  o2- and ldh release
mzc differs from mza in having a monocyclic amine ring attached to the β-carboline moiety . as shown in fig. 2c, mzc which was tested as a free base, was less potent than mza in affecting pma-stimulated txb <dig> generation . mzc  <dig> μm reduced txb2release to  <dig>  % of control . similarly, as depicted in fig. 3c, mzc was less potent than mza in affecting pma-stimulated o2- generation . mzc  <dig> μm reduced o2- release to  <dig>  % of control .

as shown in fig. 2c, mzc affected opz-stimulated txb <dig> , similar to mza. mzc  <dig> μm reduced txb <dig> generation to  <dig>  % of control . furthermore, as depicted in fig. 3c, mzc reduced opz-stimulated o2- generation , higher than mza. mzc  <dig> μm reduced o2- generation to  <dig>  % of control .

as shown in fig. 2c and 3c, and in contrast to mza, mzc was cytotoxic to neonatal brain microglia though not as much as mzb. substantial ldh release was observed at  <dig> μm . in summary, similar to mzb, the data suggests that the reduction of both o2- and txb <dig> generation resulted from both pharmacological and toxic effects of mzc on lps-activated microglia cells.

effect of manzamine d on lps-activated neonatal brain microglia txb <dig>  o2- and ldh release
mzd differs from mza in having a tetrahydrocarboline group in the molecule . as shown in fig. 2d, mzd that was tested as its hydrochloride salt, strongly affected pma-stimulated txb <dig> generation . mzd  <dig> μm reduced txb <dig> release to  <dig>  % of control . furthermore, as shown in fig. 3d, mzd also strongly affected pma-stimulated o2- generation. mzd  <dig>  μm reduced o2- release to  <dig> % of control .

in contrast, as shown in fig. 2d the effect of mzd on opz-stimulated txb <dig> generation was limited. mzd  <dig> μm reduced txb <dig> generation to  <dig> % of control . furthermore, as shown in fig. 3d, mzd did not affect opz-stimulated o2- generation even at  <dig> μm.

as shown in fig. 2d and 3d, and in contrast to mzb and c, mzd was very cytotoxic to microglia when pma was used as an agonist to trigger o2- and txb <dig> release: mzd at  <dig>  μm caused  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of total ldh released by  <dig>  % triton x- <dig> treated-microglia . in contrast to the limited effect of mzd on opz-stimulated microglia, the data suggests that the reduction of pma-stimulated o2- and txb <dig> generation resulted from both pharmacological and toxic effects of mzd on lps-activated microglia cells.

effect of manzamine e on lps-activated neonatal brain microglia txb <dig>  o2- and ldh release
as shown in fig.  <dig>  mze differs from mza in having a saturated ketone functionality in the eight-membered amine ring. as depicted in fig. 2e, mze inhibited pma-stimulated txb <dig> generation with a maximum  <dig>  % inhibition observed at  <dig> μm . furthermore, as shown in fig. 3e, mze inhibited pma-stimulated o2- generation with a maximum  <dig>  % inhibition observed at  <dig> μm .

as shown in fig. 2e, mze had limited effect on opz-stimulated txb <dig> generation, with a maximum  <dig>  % inhibition at  <dig> μm . similarly, as depicted in fig. 3e, mze did not affect opz-stimulated o2- generation even at  <dig> μm.

as shown in fig 2e and 3e, cytotoxicity of mze to microglia measured as ldh release was low even at  <dig> μm .

effect of manzamine f on lps-activated neonatal brain microglia txb <dig>  o2- and ldh release
mzf differs from mza in having a saturated ketone functionality in the eight-membered amine ring and hydroxylation at the c- <dig> position of the β-carboline ring system . as shown in fig. 2f, mzf did not inhibit pma-stimulated txb <dig> generation. in the presence of  <dig> μm mz, txb <dig> release was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % of control txb <dig> generation . similarly, as shown in fig. 3f, mzf did not inhibit pma-stimulated o2- release. in the presence of  <dig> μm mzf, o2- release was  <dig> ±  <dig>  % of control o2- generation .

as shown in fig. 2f, mzf effect on opz-stimulated txb <dig> generation was weak, with a non-statistically significant  <dig>  % inhibition at  <dig> μm . similarly, as depicted in fig. 3f, mzf was minimally effective in inhibiting opz-stimulated o2- generation, only a non-statistically significant  <dig>  % inhibition observed at  <dig> μm.

as shown in fig. 2f and 3f, cytotoxicity of mzf to neonatal brain microglia measured as ldh release was low even at  <dig> μm .

effect of manzamine a, b, c, d, e and f on hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase generated o2-
in order to determine a potential scavenging effect of mza, b, c, d, e and f on o2-, a standard hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase system was used as a cell-free source of o2-  <cit> . as shown in fig.  <dig>  o2- generation by incubation of purified xanthine oxidase with hypoxanthine was abolished by superoxide dismutase. furthermore, dmso, the vehicle used to prepare the manzamines, did not affect o2- formation . similarly, mza, b, and e did not significantly affect o2- generation . in contrast, mzc, d and f appeared to enhance o2- formation , p <  <dig>  mzd). thus we conclude that the inhibition of either pma or oz stimulated-o2- release from lps-activated microglia by the manzamines was not the result of a direct o2- scavenging effect.

discussion
the important role of neuroinflammation and glial activation in the pathogenesis of brain disorders has progressively been established  <cit> . because in vitro lps-activated microglia appear to mimic the functions of activated microglia found in neuroinflammatory conditions in vivo  <cit> , we used lps-activated rat microglia as a relevant in vitro paradigm to search for marine natural products that may modulate the enhanced release of txb <dig> and o2- from activated microglia  <cit> . using this in vitro model we have previously communicated that mza, a secondary metabolite isolated from the okinawan marine sponge haliclona sp <cit> , inhibited txb <dig> and o2- generation by microglia  <cit> . the current study extends our initial observations, and reports a structure-activity relationship study with manzamines a, b, c, d, e and f on both pma and opz-stimulated release of txb <dig> and o2- from lps-activated rat neonatal microglia.

members of the eicosanoid family  are important mediators of inflammation that would appear to be play a causative role in the pathogenesis of several cns disorders  <cit> . increased levels of eicosanoids have been observed in neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  <cit> , multiple sclerosis  <cit> , ischemia and seizures  <cit> , prion diseases  <cit> , human immunodeficiency virus-associated dementia  <cit>  and alzheimer's disease  <cit> . following the seminal observation that microglia release eicosanoids  <cit> , numerous studies have increasingly supported the notion that activated brain macrophages may be the main source of both prostaglandins  <cit>  and thromboxanes  <cit>  in these neurodegenerative diseases. thus modulation of microglia enhanced prostanoid synthesis has been investigated as a potential drug therapeutic approach for intervention in neuroinflammatory disorders of the cns  <cit> . one possible approach to diminish enhanced eicosanoid production has been to search for inhibitors of signal transduction pathways involved in eicosanoid synthesis in activated microglia  <cit> . in our study, we used pma and opz, agonists known to activate p44/ <dig> and p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinases in microglia  <cit> , to target distinct signal transduction pathways that cause txb <dig> release in rat neonatal microglia activated by an in vitro exposure to  <dig>  ng/ml of lps for  <dig> hours  <cit> . as shown in fig.  <dig>  the  <dig> marine-derived manzamine analogs attenuated pma-stimulated txb <dig> generation differentially and in the following order of decreasing potency: mza>mzd>mzb >mzc>mze and f. in contrast, the manzamine analogs inhibited opz-stimulated txb <dig> generation with reduced potency: mzb>mza>mzc>mzd, mze and mzf. thus, with the exception of mzb and mzc which modulated both pma and opz-stimulated txb <dig> release with similar potency, mza, mzd, mze and mzf inhibited txb <dig> release with lower potency when opz was used as an agonist.

it is interesting to compare our differential results with the mza, b, c, d, e, and f with those reported for other agents that have been shown to modulate microglia eicosanoid release by targeting the cyclooxygenase i and ii enzymes which are expressed in activated rat and human microglia  <cit> . pge <dig> and txb <dig> synthesis that occurs concomitantly with lps-induced activation of rat  <cit>  and human microglia  <cit> , has been shown to be attenuated by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  with differing activities towards the two isoforms of cox. thus, lps-induced microglia pge <dig> synthesis was reduced by cox- <dig> inhibitors: acetylsalicylic acid    <cit> , flurbiprofen   <cit>  and indomethacin   <cit> , and the cox- <dig> inhibitor ns- <dig>   <cit> . even though nsaids have been reported to attenuate neurotoxicity in vitro  <cit>  and neuroinflammation in animal models  <cit> , an important caveat is the fact that determining the best nsaids for clinical neurodegenerative disease management appears to remain a matter of considerable debate in view of their well known adverse effects  <cit> . thus, although the molecular mechanism by which the manzamines inhibit txb <dig> release in lps-activated cells remains currently undetermined, mza inhibited pma-stimulated eicosanoid generation in vitro with potency similar to that of the cox- <dig> inhibitor indomethacin  <cit> , potency that was higher than that of other nsaids that have been reported to modulate enhanced eicosanoid release in both activated rat and human microglia  <cit> .

the involvement of reactive oxygen species  has been documented in cns pathologies, such as parkinson's disease, alzheimer's disease, huntington's disease, down's syndrome, cerebral ischemia and reperfusion, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis and meningitis  <cit> . prolonged exposure to ros may potentially damage neurons, particularly their synapses  <cit>  as well as oligodendrocytes, the myelin producing cell of the cns  <cit>  by overriding normal cns antioxidant defense mechanisms, e.g. superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione-s-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, permanently affecting cellular function  <cit> . thus the mechanism of ros generation by cns leukocytes, i.e. infiltrating neutrophils and monocytes as well as resident microglia production of o2-, hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide in cns, has received considerable attention since the mid-1980s  <cit> . in fact, during the past  <dig> years, numerous research groups have shown that o2- may be generated by microglia isolated from rat, mice, hamsters, dogs, swine and humans, when stimulated with a variety of agonists such as phorbol ester, opsonized zymosan, calcium ionophore, antiviral antibodies, antibody-coated red blood cells and myelin . we and others have hypothesized that rather than scavenge ros with antioxidants, the modulation of the signal transduction mechanism leading to microglia ros generation might be putatively a better therapeutic strategy to turn off or reduce ros generation that could lead to neuronal injury  <cit> . as depicted in fig.  <dig>  the manzamine analogs attenuated pma-stimulated o2- generation in the following order of decreasing potency: mzd>mza>mzb>mzc>mze and mzf. in contrast, and similarly to their weaker effect on opz-stimulated txb <dig> generation, all the manzamine analogs modulated opz-stimulated o2- generation with lower potency: mzb>mzc>mza, mzd, mze and mzf. interestingly, as shown in fig.  <dig>  the effect of mzd, a, b and c on pma-stimulated o2- formation was not the result of any detectable scavenging o2-, because none of the manzamines inhibited a standard hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase system that was used as a cell-free source of o2-. thus, although the exact mechanism by which the manzamines modulate o2- release by microglia remains currently undetermined, we have demonstrated that these compounds clearly modulate the signal transduction pathway that pma triggers in microglia and ultimately leads to o2- generation.

it is interesting to compare our differential results with the mzd, a, b and c with those reported for other agents that modulate pma-stimulated o2- generation in microglia. interestingly, mzd, a, b and c demonstrated higher potency than three clinically available agents shown to inhibit pma-stimulated o2- generation: propentofylline, a selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor   <cit> , cabergoline, a potent and selective agonist of d2-dopamine receptors   <cit> , and nicergoline, an ergoline derivative used for cerebrovascular diseases   <cit> . it is noteworthy that these agents have been proposed to confer protective effects against neurodegenerative diseases which may involve o2- release by activated rat microglia.

in order to determine if the effect of the manzamines on pma or opz-triggered txb <dig> and o2- generation was either pharmacological or toxic, we investigated ldh release from lps-activated rat neonatal microglia. ldh has extensively been used as a marker for cell cytotoxicity  <cit> . the results from our investigation appear to demonstrate that the manzamine analogs clearly differed in their effect on ldh release from lps-primed microglia: mza, mze and mzf generated less than 50% of maximal ldh release at  <dig> μm, and thus were the least toxic analogs; mzb and mzc induced greater than 50% of ldh release at  <dig> μm; while mzd showed greater than 50% of ldh release at  <dig>  μm when pma rather than opz was used as an agonist, thus its toxicity contrasted with the other analogs tested. thus even though mzd inhibited pma-stimulated o2- generation with slightly higher potency than mza, because mzd caused concomitant ldh release at low concentrations , the nature of the inhibitory effect on pma-triggered o2- and txb <dig> release, either toxic or pharmacological, remains currently unresolved. in summary, the in vitro studies described herein suggest that mza is the most potent manzamine analog of the series investigated because both pma-stimulated o2- and txb <dig> were potently inhibited with the lowest concomitant release of ldh.

it is of interest to consider the results of our structure-activity relationship  study with the manzamines, alkaloids characterized by a complex heterocyclic ring system attached to the c- <dig> of the β-carboline moiety. from the sar perspective, the potent effect of mza and d hydrochloride salts on pma-stimulated o2- and txb <dig> suggests that the solubility or ionic forms are contributing factors to their bioactivity. furthermore, the fused 13-membered macrocyclic and octahydroisoquinoline ring system, and any substitutions in these rings would appear to be less important for their in vitro activity. finally, changes such as saturation or oxidation of the β carboline or the 8-membered amine ring tended to decrease bioactivity in both o2- and txb <dig> assays.

taken together, our current data demonstrates that the most potent and least toxic manzamine analog, namely mza, was less effective in attenuating o2- and txb <dig> from lps-activated microglia when the triggering agonist was opz rather than pma. similar differential effects between pma and opz-triggered signaling have been observed with other natural products  <cit> . furthermore, the current data suggest the following on the as yet undefined mechanism of action of mza: firstly, that the mza molecular target plays a critical role in o2- and txb <dig> generation initiated by pma upon binding to pkc  <cit>  and activation of the p44/ <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway  <cit> ; secondly, that the mza molecular target probably plays a less critical role in o2- and txb <dig> release elicited by opz, a ligand of the microglial cell surface complement receptor  <dig> shown to activate the p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway  <cit> . studies to determine which element is targeted by mza in the p <dig> and/or p44/ <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in lps-activated rat microglia are currently underway in our laboratory.

CONCLUSIONS
our present results provide the first experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that the marine-derived β-carboline alkaloid manzamines differentially modulate both o2- and txb <dig> generated by e. coli lps-activated rat neonatal microglia. additional conclusions are the following: firstly, sar studies demonstrated that at in vitro concentrations that were non-toxic to e. coli lps-activated rat neonatal microglia, mza was the most potent inhibitor of o2- and txb <dig>  secondly, although the mechanism by which mza inhibited pma-stimulated txb <dig> generation in vitro is as yet unclear, its potency was similar to the cox- <dig> inhibitor indomethacin  <cit> , and thus higher than other nsaids reported to modulate enhanced eicosanoid release in both activated rat and human microglia  <cit> . thirdly, although the mechanism by which mza inhibited pma-stimulated o2-generation in vitro remains undetermined, mza was more potent than propentofylline, a selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, cabergoline, a potent and selective agonist of d2-dopamine receptors and nicergoline, an ergoline derivative used for cerebrovascular diseases, compounds which have been proposed to confer protective effects against neurodegenerative diseases by affecting o2- release by activated rat microglia. fourthly, sar studies which demonstrated that the ionic forms are a contributing factor to the bioactivity of the complex manzamine heterocyclic ring system attached to a β-carboline moiety may explain the potent effect of mza and d hydrochloride salts on pma-stimulated o2- and txb <dig>  interestingly, the fused 13-membered macrocyclic amine and octahydroisoquinoline ring system, as well as substitutions in these rings appeared to be a non-factor for the in vitro activity of the manzamines. finally, the reported pharmacokinetic properties and the lack of significant in vivo toxicity  <cit>  of mza, a β-carboline alkaloid whose complete synthesis has been reported  <cit> , would suggest that mza is a prime candidate for further investigation of its potential utility as a pharmacophore from which new and novel therapeutic agents for neuroinflammatory diseases might be developed.
