BACKGROUND
dna-binding transcription factors  are central to the cell’s ability to recognize and decode the gene regulatory instructions contained in the genome. their activating or repressing effect is achieved by binding to so-called motif instances, which are specific dna sequence fragments in the regulatory regions of the genome, often in close proximity to the regulated gene. this binding was traditionally studied in isolation, despite the fact that many well-studied tfs were known to bind cooperatively to dna by forming well-defined dimers or  higher-order complexes. important examples of such direct cooperativity include the p <dig> homotetramer
 <cit> , the nf-κb heterodimer
 <cit> , various bhlh dimers
 <cit> , sox2–pou5f <dig>  dimerization in embryonic stem cells
 <cit>  and, more recently, ar–foxa <dig> dimerization in prostate cancer cells
 <cit> . in all these cases, the genomic binding sites of cooperating tfs form well-defined rigidly spaced motif complexes, i.e. motif pairs with fixed relative orientation and spacing. this is in contrast to indirect cooperativity, i.e. fuzzily spaced co-binding of any tf pairs, which can be inferred by several existing bioinformatics approaches
 <cit> .

the list of known dna-binding tf dimers and multimers has expanded rapidly – we recently compiled from the biochemical literature a list of  <dig> such complexes that have experimental support
 <cit> . an updated and more complete list containing  <dig> tf complexes is shown in figure 
 <dig>  concomitantly, numerous studies have used in silico analysis to computationally predict tf dimers. since the goal of these studies was to predict specific ternary complexes of tfs with dna, they scanned for pairs of tf-binding motifs enriched at a fixed relative orientation and spacing in regulatory regions. we previously developed one such method
 <cit>  that exploited the abundance of dnase-seq datasets available from the encode consortium
 <cit> . others have used dnase i hypersensitivity data on a smaller scale
 <cit> , as well as tf chip-seq data
 <cit>  and also sets of promoter or enhancer regions
 <cit>  to define the regulatory elements of interest.

currently, two software tools exist for performing the motif dimer enrichment analysis described above: spamo
 <cit>  and itfs
 <cit> . one important drawback of these tools is that they cannot assess enrichment of motif pairs that are so close that they overlap, even though such overlap is common
 <cit> . we previously developed a mathematical framework for tf dimer prediction that accommodated motif overlap, and applied it to a set of dnase-seq profiles
 <cit> . here, we introduce taco , a software tool that generalizes this approach. a major advance of the current work is that we have now encapsulated the algorithm into a user-configurable standalone tool. another major improvement is that taco is universally applicable to regulatory element annotations from any source, rather than being restricted to dnase-seq datasets. taco also incorporates a novel motif clustering protocol  and standardized output formats.

we applied taco to  <dig> dnase-seq datasets from two sources in order to assess the consistency of the predicted dimers. we also compared taco to spamo and itfs, by benchmarking the three algorithms on the set of  <dig> known dimers. to demonstrate the robustness of taco, we further applied the method to  <dig> chip-seq datasets from k <dig> cells.

we previously noted that tf dimers are mostly rigidly spaced and compact, and hypothesized that compactness explained rigidity
 <cit> . here, we use the expanded set of dimer predictions to test this hypothesis. consistently with this hypothesis, we uncovered a significant correlation between the rigidity and compactness of predicted tf dimers.

RESULTS
consistency of dnase-seq-based tf dimer prediction
the encode project consortium
 <cit>  provides multiple types of whole-genome open chromatin profiles, including data from dnase-seq experiments performed at the university of washington  and duke university . in order to obtain a comprehensive set of tf dimer predictions, and also assess the robustness and generality of our method, we ran taco separately on both the uw and duke collections.

for either of the data sources , we considered all dnase-seq datasets from cell types under normal conditions  that were not embargoed as of jan  <dig>  we merged replicates and clustered cell types according to the similarity of their dnase-seq profiles, which resulted in  <dig> and  <dig> cell type clusters in uw and duke, respectively . either of the data sources covered approximately 4% of the genome.

application of taco to these two sets of genomic regulatory regions yielded  <dig> and  <dig> predicted tf dimers, respectively, of which  <dig> were shared . note that we did not expect complete overlap, since the  <dig> unclustered cell types from uw and the  <dig> from duke shared only  <dig> cell types in common. after cell type clustering, the latter  <dig> contributed to  <dig> of the  <dig> uw cell types and  <dig> of the  <dig> duke cell types. we also compared predicted tf dimers with a list of  <dig> known tf dimers manually compiled from the existing biochemical literature . note that this is an updated version of the gold-standard set used in
 <cit> . notably, we found that dnase-seq data from both uw and duke were predictive of most of the known dimeric complexes.

taco outperforms existing dimer prediction methods
we compared taco with the two other dimer prediction methods, spamo
 <cit>  and itfs
 <cit>  using the  <dig> known dimers as a benchmark set of true positives . henceforth, we tested  <dig> distinct motif pairs underlying the  <dig> known dimers, and as a control we included a set of  <dig> random motif pairs . all the tools were applied to each of the  <dig> cell-type–specific uw dnase-seq datasets. sensitivity was defined as the fraction of the  <dig> known dimers detected at any given p-value threshold. false-positive rate was defined as the fraction of the random motif dimers detected at the same threshold .

spamo and itfs were evaluated both with and without trimming of uninformative positions at motif edges. motif trimming was performed as in
 <cit>  and
 <cit> . as expected, both of these tools performed better with trimmed motifs. notably, with motif trimming, itfs performed marginally better than spamo  despite the fact that it was not designed to predict rigidly spaced tf dimers
 <cit> . ultimately, taco  clearly outperformed the other tools; note that we did not run taco with trimmed motifs, since taco is able to handle motif overlap. we also found that taco is robust to the motif sensitivity threshold chosen . notably, taco and spamo completed the benchmarking analysis reasonably fast . however, itfs could only complete the job in a feasible time when running on a cluster.

comparing the three tools by applying them to the  <dig> cell-type–specific duke dnase-seq datasets yielded comparable results, with taco  again outperforming the two other tools . combining the predictions from both dnase-seq data sources gave even better performance .

expanding the cooperativity landscape with additional dnase-seq datasets
we expected that the known instances of direct tf cooperativity would tend to coincide with the most statistically significant taco predictions, as was the case in our previous work based on uw dnase-seq data alone
 <cit> . focusing on the top  <dig> predictions derived from duke data , we found  <dig> known interactions
 <cit> , the remaining  <dig> being novel predictions. strikingly, while the known sox <dig> homodimer
 <cit>  was detected as the 2nd ranked prediction, we also found two novel sox homodimer motifs, ranked 5th and 10th respectively. the novel dimeric motifs are almost identical to the known sox <dig> motif complex, except that the spacing between the monomer binding sites is increased or decreased by a single basepair. all three dimers were found to be specific to a cluster of melanoma  cell lines, consisting of colo <dig> and mel_ <dig>  interestingly, sox <dig> is downregulated as melanocytes progress to melanoma, and its overexpression in melanoma cell lines inhibits tumorigenicity
 <cit> . our discovery of three distinct sox <dig> homodimer binding modes in melanoma provides one candidate molecular mechanism for the biological role of this tf in melanoma formation.

another novel prediction, gata–smad dimer ranked 6th, is in line with physical and functional interaction between gata <dig> and smad <dig> reported by
 <cit> . however, we cannot rule out the alternative explanation, namely that this novel prediction is a variant of the known gata–e-box dimer
 <cit> , ranked 7th, with only a half-site of palindromic e-box motif being bound in this case.

the final novel prediction in figure 
 <dig>  gata–gata, ranked 8th in figure 
 <dig>  was found specific to k <dig> cell line. gata is known to be a pioneer factor
 <cit> , and has been reported to bind cooperatively to a “gatapal” palindromic composite motif: atcwgataag
 <cit> . our predicted dimer involves a converging pair of gata motifs, as opposed to the diverging motifs in gatapal. by extension, we therefore call this prediction “gatacpal”.

chip-seq data extend the scope of taco
to demonstrate the ability of taco to incorporate regulatory element annotations from multiple sources, we applied the algorithm to  <dig> replicates from  <dig> chip-seq experiments in k <dig> cells
 <cit> . for each experiment, we downloaded from factorbook
 <cit>  the top  <dig> motifs found in chip-seq peaks using meme
 <cit> .

we used taco to scan for motif complexes that contained at least one of the  <dig> motifs discovered in the respective dataset. the partner motif in the complex could be from the transfac database or from the entire set of motifs discovered in all k <dig> datasets. in total, our analysis yielded  <dig> predicted tf dimers, of which the top  <dig> are shown in figure 
 <dig>  ranked 1st is the known ets–runx dimer
 <cit> , which was found in chip-seq peaks for pu. <dig>  a transcription factor from the ets family.

the 2nd ranked prediction, found in chip-seq peaks for nrsf , actually represents a full-length, monomeric rest motif
 <cit> . it was predicted by taco as a dimeric motif complex because “hudsonalpha/nrsf: motif3”, the third-ranked motif discovered by meme within rest chip-seq peaks, is actually only a fragment of the full-length rest motif, and the remaining fragment is very similar to the motif for nuclear receptors such as gr and pr.

the 4th ranked prediction is the known gata–e-box motif complex
 <cit> , which was also identified in the above-described analysis of duke dnase-seq datasets . here, it is overrepresented in chip-seq peaks for the e-box-binding factor tal <dig>  not surprisingly, among the top  <dig> motifs found in these chip-seq peaks, there is an e-box motif “stanford/tal1_: motif4”. the top  <dig> motifs also include the gata motif “stanford/tal1_: motif2”. such secondary tf motifs have been frequently reported in addition to the canonical ones
 <cit> . however, the biophysical interpretation of such secondary motifs is usually unclear. they could be a consequence of tethered binding, functional cooperativity or actual dimerization. these diverse mechanistic explanations can be distinguished more easily with the help of taco spacing analysis. in this case, it is clear that the secondary gata motif at tal <dig> chip-seq peaks is a consequence of gata–tal <dig> heterodimerization on dna.

dynamic landscape reveals low tf dimer reuse across cell types
the vast majority of tf dimers predicted in dnase-seq data were found specific to a single cell type only . out of the  <dig> remaining dimers in uw,  <dig> were predicted in exactly two cell types  and usually found to be reused between related cell types . note that these predictions originated from disjoint sets of genomic regions , so the predictions in different cell types are independent. a similar trend of low tf dimer reuse was observed in duke dnase-seq data .

association between rigidity and compactness of tf dimers
notably, the analysis of overrepresented motif complexes in chip-seq peaks yielded multiple long-range interactions , which were not discovered in our previous analyses of dnase-seq data . most dramatically, we observed that in two such cases, ranked 40th and 41st, up to  <dig> motif spacings were significantly overrepresented. both of these predictions involved nf-y homodimers, as did yet another of the predictions . of the  <dig> predicted nf-y homodimers,  <dig> were direct repeats,  <dig> were divergent palindromes and  <dig> was a convergent palindrome. the  <dig> different spacings for the nf-y direct repeat were broken up into two clusters one turn apart, and therefore phased to be on the same side of the dna double helix. another relatively widely spaced  interaction mentioned earlier, gata–e-box, similarly permitted flexible spacing .

in order to quantify a potential association between rigidity and compactness of tf dimers, we aggregated taco predictions derived from k <dig> chip-seq data into groups that varied only in their motif spacing , as in figure 
 <dig>  we then found pearson correlation coefficient of r =  <dig>  between the number of enriched complexes for a motif pair and their average motif spacing . the difference in average motif spacing calculated within the prediction groups, compared between completely rigid motif complexes  and flexible complexes  was found highly significant . thus, we see a highly significant correlation between the rigidity and compactness of predicted tf dimers.

in order to test the generality of the abovementioned correlation, we applied the same approach to the combined set of dnase-seq dimer predictions, obtained using uw or duke data. again, we observed a positive pearson correlation of r =  <dig>  between the number of predicted complexes for a motif pair and their spacing. however, we noticed that four of the complexes in this case dominated the correlation coefficient by virtue of having outlier values for the motif spacing; their motif spacing was more than  <dig> interquartile ranges above the third quartile. when these four data points were discarded, the correlation coefficient dropped to r =  <dig>  . however, we still observed significantly larger average motif spacing among flexible complexes as compared to the completely rigid complexes .

we further tested whether a more quantitative measure of dimer flexibility would also support the above findings on the structural properties of tf dimers. consistently, we found that the average motif spacing also correlates with the standard deviation of motif spacings for a motif pair . in this case, the pearson correlation coefficients were r =  <dig>  for k <dig> chip-seq dimers and r =  <dig>  for combined dnase-seq dimers . in summary, we found that the rigidity and compactness of motif complexes are consistently correlated, by multiple measures in two different data types.

discussion
typically, tfs bind to only a very small fraction of their motif matches in the vast human genome. it is thought that the remaining motif matches remain unbound because they lie in closed chromatin
 <cit> . this model should not apply to pioneer factors, since they have the ability to bind closed chromatin. it is therefore not clear how do pioneer factors achieve binding specificity. we previously discovered multiple potential homo- and heterodimeric complexes involving foxa <dig>  and hypothesized that this pioneer factor could achieve binding specificity by exploiting a multiplicity of dimeric binding modes
 <cit> . the pioneer factor gata may constitute yet another example of this phenomenon, given its multiple known and newly predicted dimeric binding modes .

we have so far assumed that the existence of a preferred motif spacing for a tf pair is indicative of dimeric binding. however, there is one other possible explanation that must be kept in mind. it has been shown that smad <dig> dimers can bind cooperatively to dna even in the absence of direct physical contacts
 <cit> . the authors of this study suggested that dna conformational changes induced by tf binding could be a mechanism for cooperative binding of specific smad <dig> homo- and heterodimers. it is conceivable that some of our predicted tf pairs might cooperate via allosteric changes in dna structure rather than direct protein-protein contacts.

we previously showed that tf dimers were both rigid and compact, and hypothesized based on qualitative structural arguments that their rigidity was a consequence of their compactness
 <cit> . such a causal relationship could arise for two reasons. firstly, tf pairs binding widely spaced motifs are likely to form protein-protein contacts via their dna-distal domains, or even via intervening cofactors. such a configuration would in general be more flexible than direct physical contact between the dna-binding domains. secondly, a widely spaced complex might also gain flexibility from the greater deformability of the long stretch of intervening dna. the widely spaced complexes found in k <dig> cells provided us with an opportunity to test the above hypothesis. our results indicate that tf dimers that bind widely spaced motif pairs are significantly more flexible in their spacing, thus providing statistical support for a causal relationship between compactness and rigidity . while our analysis provides the first evidence, further biochemical experiments are required to explore this relationship in greater detail.

in cases of very high inter-domain flexibility, as is perhaps true of nf-y, even the relative orientation of individual motifs may vary. the nf-y complex contains three proteins, nf-ya, nf-yb and nf-yc, of which only nf-ya forms specific contacts with dna
 <cit> . thus, the nf-y “dimer” motifs we identified are likely to be bound by pairs of such trimers, i.e. hexamers. it is possible that inter-trimer contacts are mediated not by the dna-binding nf-ya subunit, but by the dna-distal nf-yb or nf-yc subunits. interestingly, the nf-y motif was recently reported to form well-defined complexes of fixed spacing with e-box, e2f and tata-box motifs at promoters genome-wide
 <cit> , suggesting that the ternary complexes identified here are not the only cooperative interactions involving nf-y. the same study also showed that nf-y was unusually adept at binding genomic regions that showed no activating or repressive histone marks, suggesting that the tf acts as a pioneer factor. this is again consistent with our previous hypothesis that pioneer factors derive their dna binding specificity from multiple dimeric binding modes.

although the tf dimers predicted by taco are generally rigidly spaced, it is conceivable that this reflects to some extent an ascertainment bias of the algorithm. dimers with highly flexible spacing would be harder to detect by this method, if they resulted in only weak enrichment of motif pairs at any given spacing. similarly, the fact that all of the  <dig> known tf dimers we extracted from the literature are rigid or semi-rigid could also be questioned; one could hypothesize that existing biochemical assays for detecting cooperative dimerization on dna are somehow biased against flexibly spaced dimers. however, we are not aware of any experimentally validated instances of tf dimers that can bind cooperatively with highly flexible motif spacing. notably, in a recent study, even though the algorithm used to predict tf dimers permitted some flexibility in the spacing, all of the experimentally validated dimers turned out to be rigid, i.e. they bound with high affinity only at a single motif spacing
 <cit> . thus, the evidence so far is strongly weighted towards rigid or semi-rigid tf dimers.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated the generality and consistency of tf dimer predictions made by taco by applying the algorithm to  <dig> dnase-seq datasets and  <dig> chip-seq datasets from the encode project. moreover, we showed that taco clearly outperforms existing dimer prediction tools when benchmarked on the set of  <dig> known dimers. based on all taco predictions, we found that tf dimers that bind widely spaced motif pairs are significantly more flexible in their spacing. overall, we expect taco to be widely applicable, since thousands of regulatory element datasets will be available in the near future. we also anticipate its application to regulatory annotations from assay types other than those discussed here, since the algorithm allows a great deal of flexibility in data type and mode of analysis.
