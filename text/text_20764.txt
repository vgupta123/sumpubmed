BACKGROUND
the norwegian lundehund represents a specific but small group in the variety of dog breeds which have evolved since domestication  <cit> . it stands out by exceptional characteristics like double dewclaws and extreme flexibility in shoulder and neck, which represent traits fixed in the lundehund population  <cit> . in addition, the lundehund harbors a breed disposition for a syndrome comprising particular features of protein-losing enteropathy , intestinal lymphangiectasia, gastrointestinal disturbance, inflammatory bowel disease and malabsorption designated as lundehund syndrome   <cit> . clinical signs are diarrhea, vomiting, weight loss, edema and apathy often accompanied with decreased concentrations of albumin and globulin in blood profile  <cit> . a similar condition has been described in the soft coated wheaten terrier affecting immune system, gut and kidney  <cit> . it was supposed that one or more genes involved in these complex systems might be responsible for a breed disposition for ple. an increased occurrence of ple could also be found in rottweilers and yorkshire terriers . in basenji and german shepherd, hypoalbuminemia and hypoglobulinemia was found in dogs with severe lymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis characterized by excessive infiltrates of mononuclear inflammatory cells  <cit> . it was suggested that the inflammatory bowel disease in german shepherd was the result of a complex etiology with the involvement of different variant effects similar to crohn’s disease, the chronic inflammatory bowel disease in human .

in the lundehund, a signature of selection for ls was suggested to be located on cfa  <dig> in the region of caspase recruitment domain family, member  <dig> , which is known to be associated with crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis in human  <cit> . in addition, extended haplotype homozygosity  tests suggested further breed specific characteristics like polydactyly, body size or flexibility of the joints as targets of specific selection  <cit> . genotyping the limb development membrane protein  <dig>  mutation dc- <dig>  which was shown to be associated with preaxial polydactyly in western dogs, revealed the mutant genotype  in all tested lundehund  <cit> . in general, the frequency of long stretches of homozygous genotypes on basis of bead chip data was shown to be high which was suggested to be a result of an extremely low genetic variability in the lundehund breed  <cit> .

in this study whole-genome sequencing was performed in two lundehund pools comprising ls-affected and ls-unaffected individuals. sequence data were investigated for runs of homozygosity  and variants predicted to have high or moderate effects in order to elucidate the genetic background of ls.

RESULTS
phenotype
samples of six lundehund dogs with typical characteristics of a puffin hunter phenotype including an additional toe and joint flexibility  were chosen for whole-genome sequencing in two pools. one pool enclosed three healthy dogs whereas the other pool comprised three lundehund showing severe signs of gastroenteropathy known as ls. in addition,  <dig> ls-affected lundehund with clinical signs and low blood protein parameters,  <dig> lundehund suspected to be ls-affected due to recurrent diarrhea and vomiting and  <dig> lundehund without clinical signs of ls classified as ls-unaffected were available for further analysis. characteristic clinical signs were diarrhea, vomiting, weight loss and apathy . the onset of first signs varied widely from the age of  <dig>  to  <dig>  years . some cases also showed ascites and edema in the limbs. the results of blood screening revealed hypoalbuminemia in all analyzed cases, sometimes accompanied with hypoglobulinemia, reduced levels of fructosamines and vitamin b, hypo- or hypercalcemia, as well as increased concentrations of serum folate and alanine aminotransferase.fig.  <dig> polydactyly in the lundehund. polydactyly with six toes at all four limbs is a characteristic trait in the lundehund

pedigree and association analysis
inspection of the pedigree data of all lundehund under study revealed close relationships among affected dogs . in total  <dig> female and  <dig> male ls-affected lundehund were included in this pedigree data. a complex segregation analysis revealed a recessive major gene model as the most likely mode of inheritance with the lowest − <dig> log-likelihood at  <dig>  .

genome-wide association analysis for ls in  <dig> ls-affected and  <dig> ls-unaffected lundehund showed a highly significant peak on cfa  <dig> at  <dig> ,304- <dig> ,705 bp  corresponding to  <dig> ,982- <dig> ,983 bp in canfam  <dig>  assembly  in the region of fibroblast growth factor  <dig>  and mab- <dig> domain containing  <dig> . the highest -log10p value  could be shown for one snp at  <dig> ,349 bp whereas further  <dig> snps in the associated region reached -log10p-values of  <dig> - <dig> . expected versus observed -log10p-values  showed that inflation due to stratification effects had not increased -log10p-values. the distribution of genotypes suggested a recessive effect as proposed by segregation analysis.fig.  <dig> genome-wide association analysis  for lundehund syndrome . a the manhattan-plot of the -log10

sequencing and variant detection
whole-genome sequencing of two lundehund pools with three dogs each resulted in a mean coverage of  <dig> x for lundehund pool  <dig>  and  <dig> x lundehund pool  <dig> . in total  <dig> , <dig> snps and  <dig> , <dig> insertions/deletions  could be detected for pool  <dig> as well as  <dig> , <dig> snps and  <dig> , <dig> indel for pool  <dig> in raw data after variant calling. stringent filters for read depth and quality of each variant led to a set of  <dig> , <dig> snps  as well as  <dig> , <dig> snps  for roh analysis. for these snps the mean heterozygosity per site was  <dig>  in both pools.

ls-specific roh detection
a total of  <dig> rohs specific for ls-affected dogs were detected. three rohs could be found directly in the region of association on cfa  <dig> at  <dig> ,356- <dig> ,050 bp harboring the genes coiled-coil domain containing  <dig> , fgf <dig> and mb21d <dig> . in private rohs analysis for homozygous regions which could be exclusively found in ls-affected as well as ls-unaffected lundehund,  <dig> roh regions could be detected for pool  <dig>  and  <dig> roh regions for pool  <dig> . the largest private roh region for pool  <dig> could also be found on cfa  <dig> in a wider area of  <dig> ,609- <dig> ,020 bp including  <dig> genes.

breed specific roh
consensus roh detection was performed to identify potential signatures of selection for unique breed specific characteristics whose intense human selection might be collaterally associated with the high incidence of ls in the lundehund population.

in total  <dig> lundehund specific consensuses roh regions could be detected for 500-snp windows . a notably high number of large stretches of consecutive homozygous genotypes was found on cfa  <dig> in the region of  <dig> ,627- <dig> ,816 bp and cfa  <dig> in the region of  <dig> ,903- <dig> ,739 bp. these regions harbored a large number of genes including prrx <dig>  and grem <dig>  on cfa  <dig>  furthermore, we detected a roh region on cfa  <dig> at  <dig> ,687- <dig> ,177 bp harboring nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing  <dig> . in contrast, no roh region could be detected harboring the candidate gene lmbr <dig>  for canine polydactyl mutations  <cit> . further genotyping of the intronic lmbr <dig> snp dc- <dig> revealed the mutant dc- <dig> allele homozygous in all analyzed lundehund but also in the norwegian buhund, bernese mountain dogs, briard and irish wolfhound .

variants in roh regions
detection of snps or indel predicted to have high or moderate effects in roh regions was performed to identify ls-specific or lundehund-specific variants. no variant with predicted high or moderate effects could be detected within fgf <dig> and mb21d <dig> located in the region of rohs found in the ls-affected  which matched the region of genome-wide association. in total  <dig> intron variants with a homozygous mutant genotype in ls-affected lundehund, one 3′utr and  <dig> 5′utr variants could be found in fgf <dig> with predicted low or modifier effects only. in mb21d <dig> no ls-associated variant could be detected.

analysis of private ls-specific roh regions resulted in one variant with a homozygous mutant genotype in ls-affected lundehund, a heterozygous genotype in ls-unaffected lundehund and a wildtype genotype in controls. this missense variant col28a1:g.159951t>a on eca <dig> was predicted to be deleterious  as well as probably damaging .

in roh regions detected in all lundehund  seven variants with predicted tolerated or deleterious  effects could be found. the candidate genes prrx <dig> and grem <dig> did not harbor variants with predicted high or moderate effects. nevertheless, ten intronic variants could be detected in prrx <dig> with mutant homozygous genotypes exclusively found in the lundehund pools.

functional annotation of roh regions
functional gene classification of human orthologues detected in roh regions showed a particularly high involvement in biological processes affecting cellular processes , localization , response to stimulus  and metabolic processes  in all data sets . panther overrepresentation test in roh regions in ls-affected lundehund revealed an enrichment of genes involved in cellular process , metabolic process  and transcription . private rohs detected in ls-affected dogs revealed a > <dig> fold enrichment of genes known to play a role in negative regulation of complement activation , protein activation cascade , humoral immune response  and also in the perception of taste . in consensus lundehund roh regions genes affecting single-organism  as well as cellular  and biological  processes were predicted to be overrepresented .table  <dig> statistical overrepresentation test for biological processes. all human orthologues derived from roh detection were analyzed for an enrichment of genes involved in specific processes using panther tools. the number of detected genes in roh regions in 500-snp windows and gene ontology  terms are shown for bonferroni corrected significant p-values < <dig> 



filtering for mutations with predicted high or moderate effects
specific filtering for variants with predicted high or moderate effects in the region of genome-wide association for ls revealed no variant directly in this region but one missense mutation  <dig>  mb proximal to the peak of association in the candidate gene leprel <dig> . it was predicted to result in a substitution glutamic acid to glutamine.table  <dig> filtered variants from whole-genome analysis. variants with predicted high or moderate effects and a homozygous mutant genotype exclusively found in the ls-affected pool as well as a heterozygous or homozygous wild-type genotype in the ls-unaffected pool are shown. all five reference dogs of four different breeds do not show the mutant genotype. potential functional effects of these variants were predicted using sift and polyphen

in addition, specific filtering was done for further candidate variants which could potentially be involved in disease development of ls and might have been missed in the specified roh detection windows or association analysis. we extracted genetic variants putatively associated with ls with predicted high or moderate effects which showed a homozygous mutant genotype only in ls-affected and a heterozygous mutant or wildtype genotype in ls-unaffected dogs. in total  <dig> snps and one indel resulted from filtering analysis.

based on these results we chose the missense mutation leprel1:g.139212c>g near the region of genome-wide association and further six single nucleotide variants  in other genomic regions which were predicted to be deleterious  as well as possibly or probably damaging  for validation in all lundehund samples and across several dog breeds. three of these snvs located in regions of an extreme high density of mutations, probably a result of inaccurate gene annotation, were assumed to be false positive results and therefore omitted from analysis. genotyping of the remaining four non-synonymous snvs in the region of the candidate genes leprecan-like  <dig> , centrosomal protein 164 kda , collagen, type xxvii, alpha  <dig>  and keratin  <dig>  in  <dig> lundehund revealed a significant association of cep164:g.57380g>t and leprel1:g.139212c>g with ls .table  <dig> genotypic distribution of candidate snps for ls in lundehund dogs. chi-square test results are shown for the four candidate snps chosen from filtering analysis for mutations predicted to have high or moderate effects. genotypes are assigned to lundehund without signs of ls , ls-affected lundehund  and ls-suspicious dogs  due to clinical signs

further genotyping of  <dig> dogs of  <dig> breeds with no signs of gastroenteropathic disease showed only leprel1:g.139212c>g and col28a1:g.159951t>a to be breed specific mutations for the lundehund  and revealed no significant p-value for col28a1:g.159951t>a, but a significant p-value of  <dig> e- <dig> for leprel1:g.139212c>g . a closer look at the ls-phenotypes showed that all  <dig> ls-affected lundhund harbored the homozygous mutant leprel1:g.139212c>g genotype whereas three of the six dogs which were estimated to be ls-suspicious due to clinical signs, did not show the homozygous mutant genotype.table  <dig> chi-square test for lundehund dogs and seventeen different breeds. other breeds are used as controls for lundehund-specific ls. the test results are shown for the four candidate snps chosen from filtering analysis for mutations predicted to have high or moderate effects

candidate gene sequencing
sequence analysis of leprel <dig> cdna confirmed the missense mutation in exon  <dig> in ls-affected lundehund dogs. no further snvs could be found in leprel <dig> to be associated with ls . sequencing the complementary dna  of mb21d <dig> in an affected lundehund and a reference german shepherd dog revealed three mutations. nevertheless, none of these mutations could be exclusively found in the lundehund. the predicted gene fgf <dig> cdna could not be amplified at all.

discussion
whole-genome sequencing analysis in two pools of lundehund dogs revealed a candidate gene for ls-disposition and gave evidence for potential ls-related signatures of selection. the genome-wide association analysis resulted in a significant peak on cfa  <dig> which could also be shown to be located in a roh region for ls-affected dogs. screening of whole-genome data did not reveal any ls-associated mutations with predicted high impacts on protein function but the missense mutation leprel1:g.139212c>g  <dig>  mb proximal of the region of significant genome-wide association. we assume that the shift of the peak of ls-association and ls-associated roh region might be a result of the low bead chip marker density that could be found in the region of leprel <dig>  furthermore, it could be shown that the detection of rohs is strongly dependent on the window size and marker density  <cit>  so that not all homozygous stretches can be detected in 500-snp windows. we assume that smaller windows could probably have enabled the detection of a roh region comprising leprel <dig> but might have increased the number of false positive results, too. according to the suggested recessive mode of inheritance the missense mutation leprel1:g.139212c>g could be shown to be homozygous in all analyzed dogs in ngs data. ls-affected dogs showed the mutant genotype g/g whereas ls-unaffected controls of other breeds did harbor the homozygous wild type c/c. in addition, seven lundehund with no clinical signs for ls also showed the mutant genotype g/g. due to the variable onset of the disease it can be proposed that these dogs will develop signs of the disease later in their life. we suggest this snv as a potential causative mutation for a genetic disposition for ls.

leprel <dig> was shown to be expressed in a subpopulation of neuroendocrine cells of the intestinal mucosa and suggested to be important for processing and secretion of neuropeptides  <cit> . it was proposed that the enteric nervous system could trigger the occurrence of inflammatory bowel disease through neuropeptide secretion  <cit> . neuropeptides were proposed to play a key role in inflammatory bowel diseases  <cit> . blockades for these molecules were considered for therapeutic approaches. we assume mutant leprel <dig> might be an essential precursor for ls in the lundehund. lundehund without clinical signs for ls who harbor this mutant rna could possibly be subclinically affected or fall ill later in their life by specific trigger mechanisms. it was shown that not a few lundehund who appeared healthy often had abnormal findings in histopathologic examinations  <cit> . the onset of the disease could be influenced by external factors triggering phenotypic expression. in the soft coated wheaten terrier it was proposed that food allergies could play a role in the development of ple  <cit> . in addition to external factors, further genes might be involved in triggering ls as well as influence the severity of symptoms. in human crohn’s disease various mutations have been shown to be associated with disease development in different populations . it was suggested that complex regulatory processes driven by various genes could affect the extent of defects and result in different severities.

we assume that further genes might be involved in ls-development and could potentially be related to targets of selection for breed specific traits. this could probably explain the high incidence of ls in the population. in general, roh analysis for the lundehund showed a high frequency of long stretches of homozygous genotypes as expected from the extremely low genetic variability of this breed  <cit> . a high enrichment of genes in these roh regions affecting protein activation, complement activation and humoral immune response suggested that protein-protein interactions and immunoregulatory processes might play an important role in the development of ls in the lundehund as it was previously proposed for ple in the soft coated wheaten terrier  <cit> .

variants in the candidate gene nod <dig> , which could be found to harbor a lundehund specific roh region, have been shown to be highly susceptible to inflammatory bowel disease  <cit> . it was proposed that nod <dig> plays an important role in colonic epithelial protection against intracellular organisms similar to mucin genes. in lundehund affected with atrophic gastritis an abnormal presence of mucous neck cells could be detected in the gastric mucosa  <cit> . we suppose that this gene, potentially under targeted selection in the lundehund, might predispose this breed in general for gastrointestinal problems.

further potential signatures of selection could be detected in the region of genes that might be involved in breed specific conformational traits like joint flexibility or polydactyly. according to lundehund breed standard, the lundehund was reported to have at least six toes at fore and hind limps  <cit> . mapping analysis for hind limp specific canine preaxial polydactyly revealed a potentially causative mutation in lmbr <dig>  in western dog breeds  <cit> . the homozygous mutant dc- <dig> genotype was also found in the lundehund  <cit>  and could be confirmed in all  <dig> lundehund in our study. nevertheless, it was still unclear if this mutation could explain the characteristic phenotype in the lundehund showing polydactyly at both fore and hind limps in contrast to the usually unchanged forelimb in dogs with polydactyly  <cit> . we found evidence in lundehund consensus roh regions for potential modifier genes that might play a role in limb development. grem <dig> was shown to be expressed in osteoblasts during in vivo skeletogenesis and involved in the regulation of bone formation genes  <cit> . it was suggested that grem <dig> was bidirectionally regulated by bone morphogenetic protein  <dig>  together with grem <dig>  a gene which was shown to be expressed along with sonic hedgehog  and play an important role in limb bud development  <cit> . a similar effect was suggested for prrx <dig> . loss-of-function mutant prrx1/prrx <dig> mice resulted in shortened zeugopods of the forelimbs and hindlimbs as well as postaxial polydactyly in the forelimb  <cit> . ehh analysis in the lundehund revealed prrx <dig> in long-range homozygous haplotypes suggesting this gene as a candidate for lundehund-polydactyly  <cit> . we assume that these genes under potential targeted selection could explain the specific phenotypic characteristic for a four-limb polydactyly in the lundehund.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our study of whole-genome sequencing data of lundehund dogs suggests leprel1:g.139212c>g as a potential causative mutation for ls as well as nod <dig> as a potential precursor gene which might play a role in ls breed predisposition. in addition, we identified potential signatures of selection for characteristic breed specific traits whose targeted selection might have increased genetic risk factors for disease development.

the results of our analysis represent a significant step to identify the genetic background of lundehund specific traits which still remain to be further investigated for proper understanding of the underlying complex genetic mechanisms.
