BACKGROUND
genome duplication by dna replication is fundamental for the propagation of genetic material in all organisms. eukaryotic chromosomes are replicated from multiple start sites called replication origins that initiate bidirectional dna replication. replication initiation at these origins is best understood in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, where approximately  <dig> origins are used to replicate the dna of the  <dig> chromosomes . the ability of yeast origins to provide initiation and thus autonomous replication to plasmids has allowed the functional dissection of origin elements by measuring plasmid maintenance rates and has coined the term autonomous replicative sequence .

plasmid maintenance studies have revealed that yeast origins have a modular structure. they all share a so-called ars consensus sequence , which is a binding site for the origin recognition complex , the replication initiator. the six-subunit orc complex binds to the origins in an atp-dependent manner and, together with cdc <dig> and cdt <dig>  recruits the mcm complex, which likely is the replicative helicase, to form the pre-initiation complex . however, an orc binding site alone is not sufficient to generate an origin. the ars <dig> origin additionally contains three b elements that are required for full initiation  <cit> . the sequence closest to the orc binding site, b <dig>  cooperates in orc binding and dna unwinding  <cit> , and b <dig> is required for loading of the mcm complex  <cit> . interestingly, the b <dig> site is a binding site for the protein abf <dig>  which functions as a transcription factor elsewhere in the genome  <cit> . the precise function of abf <dig> in initiation is not known, but may include a role in nucleosome positioning and origin site selection  <cit> . the involvement of transcription factors in initiation seems to be more general, because other transcription factors, rap <dig> and mcm <dig>  have also been identified as origin binding factors that influence initiation  <cit> . also, tethering acidic activators to origins improves initiation  <cit> , suggesting that transcription factors have a general role in replication initiation.

notably, individual ars elements within the yeast genome share very little sequence conservation outside of the acs. this observation supports the notion that yeast replication origins, in addition to orc, bind several different auxiliary factors, among them transcription factors that aid in replication initiation, thus explaining why consensus sequences cannot easily be recognized. in this model, different subsets of origins are bound by different replication modulators that support full initiation of these origins.

in our previous work, we identified the sum <dig> protein as a novel auxiliary initiation factor  <cit> . in contrast to the transcription factors described above, sum <dig> in other contexts functions as a transcriptional repressor. it binds upstream of a number of middle sporulation genes and represses them during vegetative growth by recruiting the histone deacetylase  hst <dig> to the promoter, thus providing chromatin-mediated gene repression  <cit> . in this function, sum <dig> is part of a protein complex containing hst <dig> and the bridging repression factor of mses, rfm <dig>  <cit> .

in addition to its repressor function, sum <dig> shows several links to orc-mediated replication initiation as well as repression of the silent mating-type loci hml and hmr. the deletion of sum <dig>  is synthetically lethal with a conditional mutation in orc <dig>  orc2- <dig>  which causes an initiation defect  <cit> . this suggests that a number of origins require sum <dig> as an auxiliary factor, such that cells cannot tolerate the loss of sum <dig> when orc function is compromised. accordingly, a number of sum1-dependent origins have been identified  <cit> . sum <dig> also shows a weak physical interaction with orc  <cit> . interestingly, a mutant version of sum <dig>  sum1- <dig>  was identified that bestows upon sum <dig> an improved ability to interact with orc  <cit> . sum1- <dig> thus is aberrantly recruited to a number of origins, among them the silent mating-type locus hmr, where it establishes hst1-dependent gene silencing  <cit> . natural sum <dig> binds to the hml-e silencer and, in cooperation with other silencer-binding factors, promotes gene silencing at hml  <cit> .

like all metabolic processes on dna, replication initiation in eukaryotic cells must contend with the packaging of the dna into chromatin, which generally restricts access to the dna. conceptually, the chromatin structure can be changed in two different ways, by the alteration of nucleosome position via chromatin remodelling, and by changes in the posttranslational modifications of the histones  <cit> . origin function has been shown to depend on the chromosomal context and the positioning of nucleosomes by orc. nucleosomes proximal to orc facilitate the initiation of replication, whereas covering of the origin by nucleosomes interferes with initiation  <cit> . furthermore, the swi/snf chromatin remodelling complex in some contexts is required for full stability of plasmids with a minimal origin, and tethering of an activator to an origin can create dependence of the origin on a chromatin remodeller  <cit> .

replication initiation is also influenced by histone acetylation. it changes timing of origin firing in that the absence of the hdac rpd <dig> causes late origins to fire early, whereas tethering the histone acetyltransferase gcn <dig> to late origins advances their time of firing  <cit> . this suggests that the deacetylated chromatin state suppresses early initiation. furthermore, histone acetylation affects the efficiency of replication initiation at a subset of origins. the absence of the hdac sir <dig> partially suppresses the initiation defect of a cdc <dig> mutation, indicating that initiation at some origins is more efficient when the chromatin is in the acetylated state  <cit> .

in this study, we asked how sum <dig> exerted its function in replication initiation. we found that both rfm1Δ and hst1Δ were synthetically lethal with orc2- <dig>  showing that the sum1/rfm1/hst <dig> hdac complex was required for sum1's initiation function. we identified seven ars elements whose initiation capacity depended on sum <dig> and hst <dig>  in their absence, acetylation at lysine  <dig> of histone h <dig> was significantly increased at these origins. also, mutation of the acetylatable lysines in the h <dig> tail to imitate the acetylated state caused reduced initiation of these plasmids. taken together, our results show that sum <dig> recruited the hdac hst <dig> to selected origins in the yeast genome, and that histone deacetylation by hst <dig> at these origins was required for their full initiation function.

RESULTS
hst1Δ and rfm1Δ were synthetically lethal with an orc2- <dig> mutation
sum <dig> interacts with hst <dig> via rfm <dig>  <cit> , and this sum1/rfm1/hst <dig> complex represses a number of midsporulation genes. we therefore asked whether this complex was also involved in sum1's initiation function, which is reflected in the observation that an orc2- <dig> mutation is synthetically lethal in combination with sum1Δ  <cit> . to this end, we investigated whether hst1Δ and rfm1Δ were also lethal with orc2- <dig>  significantly, an orc2- <dig> strain with hst1Δ was only able to lose an ura3-marked orc <dig> plasmid on counterselective medium  if the strain had previously been provided with an orc2-carrying plasmid with a different selection marker, but not with a vector control , which was in agreement with previous work  <cit> . additionally, we found that rfm1Δ was synthetically lethal with orc2- <dig> , indicating that that the whole sum1/rfm1/hst <dig> complex was involved in the initiation function of sum <dig> 

ars activity of selected origins depended on sum <dig> and hst1
in our previous work, we used bioinformatics analysis of genome-wide binding studies to identify regions in the saccharomyces cerevisiae genome that are bound by both orc and sum <dig> and thus are good candidates for origins of replication that are regulated by sum <dig>  <cit> . this analysis revealed eight regions that showed binding of both orc and sum <dig>  and we have shown for three of these fragments that they are ars elements and require sum <dig> for full initiation capacity. to further validate these putative sum1-regulated origins, we asked whether the genes downstream of the sum <dig> binding sites were repressed by sum <dig> and hst <dig>  to this end, we queried existing microarray data for the expression of these genes in sum1Δ and hst1Δ cells  <cit> . this analysis showed that six of the genes were upregulated upon deletion of sum <dig> or hst <dig> , indicating that the localization of sum <dig> to these fragments likely recruits hst <dig> to repress the neighbouring gene through histone deacetylation. in the other two cases, sum <dig> may solely act as a replication factor, because it does not repress the gene next door.

* data from  <cit> 

we next asked whether the ars activity of these putative origins was regulated by sum <dig> and hst <dig>  to test this, in vivo plasmid maintenance of these regions was measured in wild-type, sum1Δ and hst1Δ strains. a detailed description of the ars fragments, the presence of acs and sum <dig> binding sites and their position relative to neighbouring genes is provided in additional file 1: schematic representation of the ars sequences analyzed in this study. our earlier study had shown that ars <dig>  ars <dig> and ars <dig> depended on sum <dig> for full initiation  <cit> . here, we found that sum1Δ and hst1Δ strains with cen4-ura <dig> plasmids containing ars <dig>  ars <dig>  ars <dig>  ars <dig>  ars <dig> or ars <dig> as the sole origin displayed a significantly higher plasmid loss rate than the corresponding wild-type strain , showing that both sum <dig> and hst <dig> were necessary for the ars activity of these origins. interestingly, most origins showed a stronger dependence on sum <dig> than on hst <dig>  reflecting the observation that many genes show stronger derepression by sum1Δ than by hst1Δ . the effect of sum1Δ and hst1Δ on ars activity was specific to sum1-bound origins, because a control origin that is not bound by sum <dig>  arsh <dig>  did not show an increased plasmid loss rate  <cit> .

in several cases, the plasmid loss was too high to measure a plasmid loss rate, because primary transformants failed to grow upon restreaking. this was the case for ars <dig> in a sum1Δ background and for ars <dig> in sum1Δ and hst1Δ strains .

one origin, ars <dig>  displayed dependence on sum <dig>  but not hst <dig> . this reflected the fact that the neighbouring gene, nkp <dig>  was not repressed by hst <dig> or sum <dig>  and suggested that this origin was regulated by sum <dig> independently of the sum1/rfm1/hst <dig> complex.

we further extended our analysis to the ars <dig> origin that we had previously identified as a sum1-regulated origin by searching for co-occurrences of an acs and a sum <dig> consensus-binding site  <cit> . ars <dig> was highly unstable in sum1Δ as well as in hst1Δ strains , thus precluding the measurement of plasmid loss rates and showing that this sum1-regulated origin also depended upon hst <dig> 

in contrast to other intergenic fragments, the region designated ars <dig> was not capable of ars activity, because wild-type and mutant strains transformed with ars <dig> plasmids formed pinprick colonies that did not develop into viable cells after restreaking . we tested ars activity of a  <dig> -kb as well as a  <dig> -kb fragment comprising the putative orc and sum1-binding region, but both failed to support autonomous replication. this was in agreement with the fact that this region is designated ars <dig> by  <cit> , but not in the saccharomyces genome database  .

in summary, these data showed that seven origins that were bound by sum <dig>  required both sum <dig> and hst <dig> for full initiation activity, suggesting that sum <dig> recruited the sum1/rfm1/hst <dig> complex to these origins, and that histone deacetylation by hst <dig> contributed to initiation function.

sum1Δ and hst1Δ caused increased histone h <dig> aceylation at selected origins of replication
the dependence of origin function on the hdac hst <dig> suggested that histone deacetylation was necessary for efficient initiation activity. we therefore determined whether acetylation levels at these origins increased in the absence of sum <dig> or hst <dig>  hst1Δ has previously been shown to moderately increase h <dig> and h <dig> acetylation  <cit> , but hst <dig> specificity so far has not been determined. for this purpose we performed chromatin immunoprecipitations  with antibodies against different histone h <dig> acetyl-lysine residues. importantly, we found that acetylation of h <dig> k <dig> was significantly increased at most ars in the absence of sum <dig> and of hst <dig> . these results indicated that h <dig> k <dig> was a target for deacetylation by hst <dig>  in contrast, h <dig> k <dig> acetylation was not increased at a control region not bound by sum <dig>  arsh <dig> . cdc <dig> served as an additional control region that showed an increase in acetylation with the h <dig> k <dig> antibody, which was only significant in one of the two experiments , but not with the other antibodies .

furthermore, this observation suggested that hst <dig> directly affected replication initiation at these origins by deacetylating histone h <dig> k <dig>  there were three exceptions to this scenario. ars <dig> plasmid maintenance was independent of hst <dig>  but ars <dig> showed an hst1-dependent increase in h <dig> k <dig> acetylation. furthermore, sum <dig> was required for full ars activity of ars <dig> and ars <dig>  but apparently did not affect their acetylation state . thus, there seem to be scenarios where the relationship between sum <dig>  histone deacetylation and initiation is more complex. in contrast to h <dig> k <dig>  h <dig> k <dig> acetylation was not significantly increased at sum1- and hst1-dependent ars elements. whereas ars <dig> and ars <dig> showed a higher amount of h <dig> k <dig> acetylation in hst1Δ  cells, the effect for ars <dig> was only significant in the sum1Δ strain . the other origins showed no increase in acetylation . this suggested that h <dig> k <dig> was not a major target for deacetylation by hst <dig>  and that this site did not contribute to the regulation of initiation.

similarly, our analysis indicated that h <dig> k <dig> was not a general target of deacetylation by hst <dig>  only ars <dig> and ars <dig> showed a significant higher h <dig> k <dig> acetylation level in both sum1Δ and hst1Δ yeast strains .

chip analysis with a poly-acetyl-h <dig> antibody showed overall increases in the acetylation levels at these origins in sum1Δ and hst1Δ strains. whereas ars <dig> and ars <dig> showed a several fold higher acetylation, the effect was weaker for ars <dig> and ars <dig> and only significant for the sum1Δ strain. ars <dig>  ars <dig> showed no significant increase in h <dig> acetylation, and ars <dig> and ars <dig> had the same state of acetylation in all three strains . this was consistent with the notion that h <dig> k <dig> was the main target of the histone deacetylase hst <dig>  whereas other histone h <dig> lysine residues were minor or no targets of hst <dig> 

in summary, this analysis suggested that sum <dig> regulated initiation at selected origins by recruiting hst <dig> to these regions.

changes in h <dig> acetylation caused defects in plasmid stability
the previous experiments raised the question whether increases in histone acetylation at origins by sum1Δ or hst1Δ were responsible for the loss of origin activity. to test this, we asked whether the activity at these origins was decreased in a strain in which the acetylatable lysine residues of the h <dig> n-terminus  were mutated to glutamine. these mutations mimic a constant acetylation state of the respective histone h <dig> residue as is the case in the absence of the hdac hst <dig>  we then analyzed the effect of this mutation on plasmid stability of the two plasmids that were most strongly affected by sum <dig> and hst <dig>  ars <dig> and ars <dig>  significantly, strains with ars <dig> or ars <dig> plasmids showed a reduced growth rate in an h <dig> mutant strain as compared to wild-type , indicating a loss of plasmid stability. in contrast, arsh <dig>  whose acetylation level did not alter in the absence of hst <dig> or sum <dig>  did not show a reduced growth rate in the h <dig> mutant strain . it has previously been reported that a simultaneous mutation of histone h <dig> k <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> to glutamine lengthens the cell cycle  <cit> . however, the observation that we did not detect a difference in the growth ability of mutant cells compared to wild type with the control plasmid  indicated that the growth differences with ars <dig> and ars <dig> were specific to these origins and not due to a generalized growth defect of the h <dig> mutation. in summary, this suggested that increases in the acetylation level in sum1Δ and hst1Δ cells were responsible for the reduced origin activity of these ars elements.

discussion
replication initiation in eukaryotic cells takes place on the chromatin template, which raises the question how the modification state of histones influences initiation. in this study, we found that the dna binding factor sum <dig> recruited the histone deacetylase hst <dig> within the sum1/rfm1/hst <dig> complex to selected yeast origins to deacetylate histone h <dig>  we found the most prominent effect for deacetylation of h <dig> k <dig>  whereas other h <dig> acetylation sites were only affected at a minority of the origins.

how is histone deacetylation beneficial for initiation? the deacetylation of h <dig> k <dig> may help to stabilize the position of nucleosomes around the origin, for instance by altering dna-histone contacts in the nucleosome, which has been shown to be important for initiation efficiency  <cit> . alternatively, a particular deacetylated histone residue may recruit a histone-binding protein  that recognizes h <dig> k <dig> in the deacetylated state and that has a positive effect on initiation. for instance, the acetylation may serve to recruit a chromatin remodeller that places the surrounding nucleosomes at a position that is conducive to initiation, which is in line with the observation of a role for chromatin remodellers in initiation  <cit> . it is also possible that sum1/rfm1/hst <dig> indirectly affects initiation by altering the expression of genes encoding replication proteins.

it is interesting to note that we found histone deacetylation by hst <dig> to be beneficial for initiation, whereas the hdac sir <dig> seems to negatively regulate initiation  <cit> . pappas et al. identified several origins whose plasmid maintenance capacity improved upon deletion of sir <dig>  while we found a decreased maintenance rate for a different set of origins in the absence of hst <dig>  also, both hst1Δ and sir2Δ affected the survival of mutations in genes encoding replication factors, but hst1Δ reduced their viability , whereas sir2Δ enhanced it  <cit> . this indicates that the two hdacs both have a global effect on replication initiation, but that they influence initiation in opposite directions. this disparity may be explained by the different substrate specificities of the two enzymes. we show here that hst <dig> mainly deacetylates h <dig> k <dig>  while the main target of sir <dig> is h <dig> k <dig>  <cit> . the difference in specificity may lead to the recruitment of separate sets of regulatory factors that have different effects on nucleosome positioning and initiation. thus, the effect of histone acetylation on efficiency of a particular origin seems to be highly dependent on the chromatin context of the origin. this is comparable to the effect of chromatin remodellers on transcription, where remodelling at one promoter can lead to the exposure of a transcription factor binding site, and thus to enhanced transcription, whereas remodelling at another promoter may lead to the occlusion of a binding site, and hence reduced expression of that gene  <cit> .

it is also possible that the sum1/rfm1/hst <dig> complex affects the time during s phase when an origin becomes active, much like increased histone acetylation at an origin by targeted gcn <dig> or by the absence of rpd <dig> advances initiation  <cit> . in this respect, sum1Δ and hst1Δ may delay the firing of many origins, such that the origins are inactivated by replication forks emanating from earlier origins and thus decreased in their firing efficiency, leading to synthetic lethality in orc2- <dig> cells.

a further possibility is that the sum <dig> complex influences initiation via an effect on transcription of the neighbouring gene, since transcription has previously been shown to influence origin firing  <cit> .

although hst <dig> is an hdac, it is also conceivable that deacetylation of a non-histone target, for instance a pre-rc component or other regulator of initiation, has an impact on initiation. however, our observation that mutation of the acetylatable lysine residues in h <dig> caused a similar effect on initiation as the deletion of hst <dig> lends support to the notion that hst <dig> affected initiation through histone deacetylation.

the fact that the sum1/rfm1/hst <dig> complex becomes essential when orc function is compromised by the orc2- <dig> mutation implies that a considerable number of origins in the yeast genome require this complex for initiation. one might then postulate that replication of the genome is not efficient enough in the absence of the sum <dig> complex to support viability when initiation is reduced by an orc mutation. however, in our analysis we identified only seven origins as being regulated by this mechanism, a number that seems insufficient to explain the synthetic lethal effect. one possibility is that more sum1-regulated origins exist that we have not identified in our analysis. perhaps a re-analysis of the sum <dig> localization data yields new sum <dig> binding sites, as was the case for the re-evaluation of estrogen receptor binding data  <cit> .

alternatively, the sum <dig> complex may have additional functions that affect a second pathway parallel to orc function. next to its role in replication initiation, orc also has a role in sister chromatid cohesion in that it mediates the interaction of sister chromatids in a pathway parallel to the interaction mediated by cohesin complexes  <cit> . therefore, one explanation for the lethality between sum1Δ/rfm1Δ/hst1Δ and orc2- <dig> is that it reflects an additional role for the sum1/rfm1/hst <dig> complex in sister chromatid cohesion. however, since sum1Δ cells show no defect in sister chromatid cohesion  <cit> , this sum1-mediated cohesion pathway may act as a back-up in cells where orc-mediated cohesion is impaired.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have identified a role for histone deacetylation by the sum1/rfm1/hst <dig> complex in enhancing the efficiency of replication initiation at a subset of origins. as a generalized model, our work implies that dna binding proteins that bind close to an orc binding site, aid in replication initiation by recruiting chromatin-modifying activities, in this case a histone deacetylase, to the origin. we postulate that deacetylation of h <dig> k <dig> helps to position nucleosomes near the origin in a location favourable to replication initiation. given that transcription factors are also involved in initiation in metazoans  <cit> , it will be interesting to see how they affect chromatin modification states at origins in multicellular organisms.
