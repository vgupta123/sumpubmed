BACKGROUND
rheumatoid arthritis  is a debilitating disease that results from chronic inflammation within the synovial lining and lumen of multiple joints. overtime this can result in bone resorption and shortened life span among those effected  <cit> . using animal models to recapitulate human disease is commonly employed to both study disease mechanisms and for the discovery of new treatments. one of the two most commonly used mouse models for human ra is the acute antibody driven collagen type ii  dependent inflammatory response produced upon the intravenous  transfer of anti-cii antibodies, . the second and more physiological counter-part model involves overcoming endogenous tolerance to cii. administration of self-protein, cii, along with an adjuvant, heat killed mycobacterium suspended in mineral oil, or complete freud's adjuvant  provides a powerful pro-inflammatory response driving potent anti-cii cd4+ t-cell helper- <dig>  and t-helper-il- <dig>  cellular and anti-cii antibody responses. this model referred to as collagen-induced arthritis  recapitulates several of the more common phenotypes observed in human disease such as flares, chronic inflammation and bone resorption often leading to rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> .

monitoring peripheral blood cytokine levels in these models can be performed using various assays from elisas to multiplex bead analysis. however, several studies have clearly demonstrated the importance of studying the local immune responses at the site of disease or insult as being the most reflective of disease progression and/or appropriate response for treatment  <cit> . the fundamental cornerstone of drug discovery is the ability to select a viable target and being able to intercept that target as to modulate disease activity in a specific fashion. monitoring local cellular and biochemical responses at the tissue site of disease is crucial for predicting future disease outcomes and thus drug treatment efficacy.

for cia and caia models, local pro-inflammatory cytokines and related signaling molecules and/or transcription factors such as signal transducers and activators of transcription  parallel disease progression  <cit> . increases or decreases in such molecules may predict treatment efficacy and rate of response  <cit> . from this logic a novel methodology was designed to sample external cellular milieu directly from cryopreserved paws and limbs of arthritic mice and quantitate trace cytokines and stat activation  directly ex vivo. both molecular readouts followed the disease model and were predictive of local responses. this method will provide the investigator with a way to follow cytokine responses with signal transduction cascades and compound levels in a single tissue from a single processed sample in a high-throughput manner.

RESULTS
detection of trace cytokines in two models of rheumatoid arthritis
reproducing human disease in mouse models provides the investigator with a reproducible and controlled system whereby experiments can be performed rapidly to test various reagents, therapeutics and methods. the two most commonly used ra models for drug discovery include the collagen type ii antibody-induced arthritis model  and the more conventional collagen type ii-induced arthritis model . the caia model is a great system to study human ra in a drug discovery setting as it requires little set-up time and a meaningful result can be obtained in only a few weeks. however, one of the major disadvantages of using this model is that since there is not a sufficient cellular anti-self immune response generated, many of the classical ra promoting cytokines are undetectable in the serum of diseased mice  <cit> . much of the immune response is driven by antibody-dependent-cellular-cytotoxicity  at the site of disease, the synovial joint. transient but significant cytokine accumulation would be expected in the local tissue and possibly the draining lymph node. for drug discovery efforts it is best to chose a model that both recapitulates the human condition but also provides sufficient readouts in a relatively short time frame. the modulation of pro-inflammatory, disease-promoting cytokines, such as tnfα, il-1β and il- <dig>  using either biologics or small molecule inhibitors is crucial to controlling ra, and many trials are still in progress demonstrating this concept  <cit> .

since serum cytokines are difficult to measure using this model  <cit>  and since the most reflective disease activity can be found locally in the paw  <cit>  building an extraction assay whereby cytokines are collected from inflamed paws and read on a multiplex bead assay using the powerful luminex® technology would be greatly beneficial. as illustrated in the method schematic flow chart , front and back paws are collected and cut into small pieces  then snap frozen and stored at -80°c until ready for processing. keeping everything on dry-ice, samples were homogenized and cellular/joint extracts were analyzed for either cytokine or phosphorylated stat activation. using dexamethasone at  <dig>  mg/kg body weight we were able to validate our method modulating the local cytokine milieu using a standard-of-care option, . established arthritis was generated and glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, was given three times a week, i.p., and reduced paw swelling measured via a digital caliper  accompanied by a clinical score . body mass did not change between treatment and vehicle group . early model optimization data was collected but is not shown here for clarity. serum cytokine levels were inconsistent and in many cases undetectable as expected . however, using this extraction method both early  and late  cytokines could be detected. cytokine il-1β, one of the signature cytokines of ra and a target of a commonly used ra therapeutic  <cit> , is found shortly after arthritis induction and can be reduced upon dexamethasone treatment . similar findings were found for il- <dig> and il-1β using conventional rt-pcr methods . the source for il-1β are usually activated macrophage, dendritic cells and nk cells  <cit> . the source for il- <dig> are usually tissue activated macrophage  and dendritic cells but can also be made by b-cells  <cit> . il- <dig> is usually observed following early innate cytokines including tnfα and il- <dig>  <cit> . cytokines tnfα and il- <dig> were also reduced upon dexamethasone treatment . this reduction in inflammatory cytokines corresponded with reduced inflammation and cartilage degradation as demonstrated in paw histological h&e and safranin-o sections .

this extraction method also works for the more conventional cia model where chronic arthritis provides an array of cytokines that can be monitored both in the peripheral circulation but also locally in the paw. mice immunized against collagen type ii induce an inflammatory cascade that is triggered and propagated by the typical th1/th17-cellular response and involves cytokines il- <dig>  il-1β, tnfα, gm-csf and il- <dig>  <cit> . disease can be treated with the general standard-of-care, dexamethasone, providing reduced paw swelling , and clinical score  without overt toxicity to the animal as shown by stable body mass . reduction of circulating serum anti-collagen type ii antibodies was not observed nor correlated with disease treatment suggesting that dexamethasone only treats the symptoms and not the actual propagator of this disease . a significant drop in circulating serum il- <dig> using dexamethasone  corresponds with a reduced  <dig> day il- <dig> level in the paws of affected animals . similar results were observed for spleen . in addition, consistent drop in ifnγ and il- <dig> upon dexamethasone treatment  was also observed. the cia model recapitulates many of the common cytokine cascades that support disease augmentation and using our method we were able to monitor cytokine levels increasing and decreasing overtime in the paw in a much more dynamic manner than observed in the serum . as expected il-1β starts low at the beginning of disease and as disease progresses il-1β levels surge only to drop later as the disease begins to resolve . a spike of il- <dig> is observed early in disease possibly due to latent activated macrophage  <cit>  followed by a consistent elevated level of il- <dig> cytokine as expected  <cit> . an unlikely result is the low expression of gm-csf and tnfα in the paw of cia mice . histology results mirror expected responses as indicated by the high levels of cytokines found in the paw and serum further validating our paw cytokine extraction method .

sensitive detection of phospho-stat <dig> activation in paws of arthritic mice
what is better than the detection of extracellular molecules involved in driving the deleterious immune response liable for observed tissue damage is actually monitoring and measuring the levels of signaling molecules and transcription factors involved in generating or supporting these cytokine cascades. measuring stat proteins necessary to transduce signals from several cytokine receptors such as ifnγr , il6r  and il-2rβ/γc  provides the investigator with a way of monitoring developing disease activity and can better support drug discovery efforts by homing in on key cascades. however, it is important to note that several different cytokine receptors may converge on a single stat transcription factor pathway and are not limited to these particular stats and the converse is true that a single cytokine receptor may activate more than one stat  <cit> .

to compare our multiplex bead method to the conventional western blot analysis we ran inflamed paw extracts from caia mice on a western blot side-by-side with the multiplex bead assay measuring phosphorylated stat <dig> , stat <dig>  and stat5a/b . both pstat <dig> and pstat5a/b were similar to the vehicle only group , however, pstat <dig> showed a dramatic change from vehicle control group and this was similar with results seen for the western blot . lanes represent two independent samples from each group, densitometry analysis results are shown below the blot. comparing these results  to the multiplex bead results  the bead array provides better data resolution and a lower and more reproducible background. although, results are comparable between the two methods, the luminex® data provides greater statistical significance due to the larger signal to noise ratio. however, the bead array provides the ability to simultaneously measure several different stat molecules in a single high-throughput manner. similar results were observed for the spleen tissue but were not as robust as the paw where most of the disease activity is confined .

using the caia model significant decrease in the level of pstat <dig> as early as  <dig> hours after dexamethasone treatment  could be observed, however no significant change in pstat5a/b levels were ever observed, albeit a trend decrease does support the case of dexamethasone acting as a general immunosuppressant . as shown by pharmacokinetic analysis, dexamethasone can be detected in the paw as early as  <dig> hours post-injection and can affect downstream effector cascades . this suggests that similar therapies can be used with this reference standard of care  agent to monitor cytokine pathway modulation in conjunction with disease as exemplified in figures  <dig>  and  <dig> . similar pstat results were also obtained for the cia model  for both pstat <dig> and pstat <dig>  no change in pstat <dig> was observed in any model tested .

discussion
here we discuss a novel, yet simple, method to extract tissue cytokines and transcription factors from the paws of mice with rheumatoid arthritis. cytokines play a major role in the development of arthritis, especially at the site of initial insult, the synovial joint. ex vivo end analyses of sectioned joints only give a snap shot of active cytokine and signaling pathways and many antigens are destroyed in the processing of these tissues. our extraction method provides the investigator with a means to measure native proteins in their active confirmation without the addition of exogenous treatments. in addition, using various phosphatase and protease inhibitors we are able to detect endogenously activated phosphorylated stats that correlate well with disease activity and treatment. this method will be useful for following treatment with a small molecule inhibitor or biologic modulating cytokine pathways.

western blots are extremely useful for the detection of trace proteins; however, one of the major limitations is time and the ability to multiplex. with the advent of fluorescent western blots multiple proteins can be observed on a single membrane using different fluorochromes and excitation channels. quantitative rt-pcr is also an option; however, for the average drug discovery scientist running hundreds of ex vivo samples becomes tedious and time consuming. multiplex bead array technology has advanced to provide the researcher with a multitude of options. in addition, to detecting phospho-stat proteins we have recently expanded to include the detection of signaling molecules such as akt and protein kinase c , also molecules involved in the immuno-proteasome pathway. this means that it is possible to use this extraction method coupled with multiplex bead arrays for different disease models. one example is to use this method for studying lupus arthritis in the mrl/lpr mouse model for rapidly developing lymphoproliferative disease  <cit> . several phenotypes of human systemic lupus erythematosus  are reproduced in the commonly used new zealand merged  and mrl/lpr  models  <cit> . dermatitis, lupus arthritis and lupus nephritis are some of the most common lupus-related symptoms observed in these systems  <cit> . thus a possible alternative use for this extraction method is the ability to measure various cytokines and signaling molecules within the same sample from all three affected regions of the lupus-prone animal - joints , skin  and kidneys .

paw swelling is slowly reduced by dexamethasone in the caia model as expected, however, paw il-1β and il- <dig> does not significantly decrease below vehicle until days  <dig> and  <dig> respectively . since paw swelling is significantly reduced below that of vehicle by day  <dig> it is expected that this reduction is in due part to these reduced cytokine levels. the molecular signaling events for this change can be observed using both western blot and luminex® cytokine beads, however, due to the lowered sensitivity of western blots a significant result using the multiplex bead method is lost, using western blots, due to signal strength heterogeneity .

many of the expected cytokines are raised during arthritis in this model, such as il-1β, il- <dig> and il- <dig>  however, unexpectedly both gm-csf and tnfα remain low . gm-csf being a survival and growth factor for several haematopoietic cells especially for granulocytes and monocytes, we would expect an increase in paw expression overtime. exogenous gm-csf and tnfα have both been shown to induce arthritis in mice  <cit> . this particular study provides a limited view and is intended to give the reader an idea of how paw cytokines could be followed overtime using this multiplex technology and is not intended to be a guide. upon multiple repeats we would expect some heterogeneity but that both tnfα and gm-csf should remain elevated in the swollen paw.

another unexpected result was the failure of dexamethasone treatment to reduce the levels of circulating anti-collagen type ii  antibodies below that of vehicle . high dose dexamethasone can induce lymphocyte apoptosis, hence the use of high dose dexamethasone for the treatment of multiple myeloma  <cit> . this failure to reduce anti-cii antibodies can be explained by the fact that mouse igg has a very long plasma half-life . dexamethasone treatment of paw swelling may also reduce the levels of circulating antibody secreting cell types but impact on circulating anti-cii igg may not be observed until several months post-treatment.

one consistent observation that was noticed between the models was the general lack of pstat5a/b or pstat <dig> activation over vehicle alone . all three stat molecules were measured including stat5a/b, stat <dig> and stat <dig>  stat molecules are becoming more popular with their essential role in autoimmunity, cancer and even central nervous system  disorders  <cit> . stat molecules are unique in that they can act as signaling molecules, transcription factors, have been shown to interact with nfκb and stabilize performance and now there is accumulating evidence that there are mitochondrial stat molecules responsible for interacting with the electron-transport system and adenosine triphosphate  synthesis via interaction with ras  <cit> . as for our observations, in these models, we would have expected to see stat <dig>  stat- <dig>  stat5a/b and stat <dig> activation as these molecules are downstream of the il- <dig> , il- <dig> , gm-csf , and ifnγ  receptors respectively. the presence of il- <dig> in the paws was not surprisingly unusual as the cia model is mainly driven by typical th <dig> responses and il- <dig> helps support the signal for t-bet expression and th <dig> cell differentiation  <cit> . cytokines ifnγ and il- <dig> also increased with disease and could be reduced upon dexamethasone treatment . it is quite possible that the source of ifnγ are th <dig> cells or nk cells while il- <dig> is most likely provided by activated macrophage. it is this il- <dig> autocrine cycle that is most probably responsible for the high levels of pstat <dig> observed in the paws of affected animals. the ability of dexamethasone to decrease intrinsic pstat <dig> levels and several cytokines is most likely due to simply less inflammation as observed by reduced mean paw size and clinical score. dexamethasone, member of the glucocorticoid steroid family, is known to work via several mechanisms including the rapid upregulation of new iκbα preventing nfκb activation and nuclear translocation  <cit> , eventually leading to immunosuppression. dexamethasone is commonly used to treat various autoimmune indications including rheumatoid arthritis  and sle; in addition dexamethasone may also be used to treat various hematological malignancies  <cit> .

as expected, the two models produced similar but not completely overlapping cytokine cascades in the affected paws. the caia model is more dependent on the actions of tissue antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity  and that of macrophage and neutrophils; early innate cytokines dominate such as il-1β and tnfα . cytokine il- <dig> levels slowly increase as macrophage and dendritic cells  mature with disease progression . as for the cia model which is more dependent on typical th1/th <dig> responses further activating synovial macrophage, high levels of paw il- <dig>  along with the classical early innate cytokines such as il-1β  and il- <dig>  are also observed.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have developed a novel method of extracting and protecting cytokines and related signaling molecules from degradation and coupled it to multiplex bead arrays where by multiple potential biomarkers can be monitored simultaneously from the same sample directly ex vivo. this method is more streamlined and time-efficient than several conventional methods such as western blot analysis or rt-pcr, measures molecules in their native, non-reduced form, and can be coupled to ex vivo pharmacodynamics  and pharmacokinetic  analyses. this method may be applied to lupus models, various different organ types, such as the kidneys, and even tumor xenograft models. this method will help contribute to the understanding of how dynamic cytokine cascades at the site of disease in arthritis may aid in the discovery of new compounds or biologics with the potential to modulate local deleterious immune responses.
