BACKGROUND
avian hepatitis e virus  is the main causative agent of big liver and spleen disease, as well as hepatitis-splenomegaly syndrome in chickens . both of these diseases result in a decrease in egg production, an increase in mortality, and an enlargement of liver and spleen in broiler breeders and egg laying hens . in addition, the antibodies and viral rna of avian hev were universally detected in healthy chicken flocks, indicating that the virus can cause subclinical infections in chickens .

avian hev is a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded rna virus, belonging to the family hepeviridae along with human and swine hevs  <cit> . the complete genome of avian hev is approximately  <dig>  kb and shares roughly 50 % nucleotide sequence identity with human and swine hevs . similar to human and swine hevs, the genome of avian hev contains two noncoding regions and three open reading frames . orf <dig> encodes a non-structural protein, orf <dig> encodes a capsid protein, and orf <dig> , encodes a small phosphoprotein  <cit> . based on phylogenetic analysis, avian hev forms a separate genus from mammalian hev and is divided into at least three different genotypes  <cit> . the genomes of the different genotypes share approximately 80 % nucleotide sequence identity, while there is over 90 % nucleotide sequence identity within a single genotype  <cit> .

currently there is not an efficient cell culture system for propagating avian hev. avian hev infection is generally diagnosed using elisa to test for the presence of antibodies, and rt-pcr to detect viral rna . to date, some conventional rt-pcr and nested rt-pcr methods have been developed for the diagnosis of avian hev infection  <cit> . among these methods, the rt-pcr assays developed by huang et al. were widely used for detection avian hev infection in the flocks from the different countries  <cit> . however, these assays are time consuming, cumbersome, and prone to falsely positive results due to cross-contamination. compared to conventional rt-pcr, real-time rt-pcr  has many advantages, including simplicity, shorter detection times, and lower contamination rates, as well as higher sensitivity and specificity rates. this assay is also high throughput and easily standardized. one taqman real-time rt-pcr assay has been previously described for the detection and quantification of avian hev in clinical samples  <cit> . in comparison with a taqman assay, sybr green real-time rt-pcr is preferable due to the relatively low cost and simplified primer design. however, there is currently no report validating the use of the sybr green real-time rt-pcr for the detection and quantification of avian hev rna.

the aim of the present study was to develop a rapid, sensitive, and specific sybr green real time rt-pcr assay for the identification and quantification of avian hev rna in chicken samples and to compare its sensitivity and specificity with the currently prevailing rt-pcr methods which were developed by huang et al. and widely used for detection avian hev rna in clinical samples from the chickens in different countries.

RESULTS
preparation of the standard plasmid
the  <dig> base pair  orf <dig> gene from a chinese avian hev strain  was amplified by rt-pcr and cloned into the commercial clone vector pmd 18-t . then, the recombinant plasmid was prepared for the standard control plasmid. the inserted fragment was sequenced and confirmed for 100 % nucleotide identity with the expected orf <dig> sequence of cahev. the concentration of the recombinant plasmid was  <dig>  ng/μl, and the copy number was  <dig>  ×  <dig> copies/μl.

detection limit and standard curve of the assay
the detection limit of the sybr green real-time pcr assay was determined by testing 10-fold serial dilutions of the standard plasmids  in duplicate. the minimum limit of detection was shown to be  <dig> copies/μl of standard plasmids/reaction, with a corresponding cycle-threshold  value of  <dig>  . by plotting the ct values against the copy numbers of the diluted standard plasmid dna, the standard curve exhibited a dynamic linear range across at least  <dig> log units of dna copy number . linear regression analysis revealed that the efficiency of the assay was  <dig>  and the correlation coefficient  was  <dig>  with a slope value of  <dig>  .fig.  <dig> detection of 10-fold serial dilutions  of standard plasmid using the sybr green real-time rt-pcr. a: avian hev sybr green real-time rt-pcr amplification plot. b: standard curve where each dot represents the cycle threshold value for the amplified standard plasmid at a given copy number



specificity and reproducibility of the assay
the specificity of the sybr green real-time rt-pcr assay was determined by testing the following  <dig> avian viruses in triplicate: newcastle disease virus , avian influenza virus , infectious bronchitis virus , infectious bursal disease virus , marek’s disease virus , and j group of avian leucosis virus . in addition, the cahev stock and ultrapure water were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. in the assay only cahev was detected as a single melt peak and the other six viruses and negative control were not found . the mean ct value of cahev was  <dig>  and no ct values were measured for the other viruses or the ultrapure water.fig.  <dig> specificity of the sybr green real-time rt-pcr assay. dna or rna from cahev and six other avian viruses were tested in triplicate using the sybr green real-time rt-pcr assay



the reproducibility of the assay was determined by testing five 10-fold serial dilutions of standard plasmids  in triplicate using inter- and intra-assay comparisons. for the standard plasmids, using dilutions from 10− <dig> to 10− <dig>  the values of the intra-assay standard deviation  and coefficient of variation  ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %, respectively, and the values of the inter-assay sd and cv ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %, respectively . these data indicated that the assay was repeatable and reproducible with low variation.table  <dig> reproducibility of intra- and inter-assay with different dilution standard plasmids by sybr green real-time rt-pcr

discussion
over the last two decades remarkable progress has been made in the application of rt-pcr for the diagnosis of avian hev infection in chickens  <cit> . however there are currently no efficient cell culture lines available for the propagation of hev. several conventional rt-pcr systems have been used for the detection of partial orf <dig> and orf <dig> genes from avian hev in various biological samples such as fecal matter, serum, bile, and liver . however, these conventional rt-pcr assays are time consuming and labor-intensive with a high risk of contamination. compared with conventional rt-pcr, the real-time rt-pcr assay is a more rapid and sensitive test and is less likely to produce false positive by contamination during sample preparation. recently, a more rapid and sensitive taqman real-time rt-pcr assay has been reported and are currently under extensive evaluation with clinical chicken samples including livers, fecal and serum samples  <cit> . however, since the taqman real-time rt-pcr assay uses the 5’-3’ nuclease oligoprobe, it is not economical to perform routine testing. as an alternative, the sybr green real-time rt-pcr assay can be applied directly to any gene without the need to design and synthesize fluorescently labeled target-specific probes. in addition, the sybr green fluorogenic molecules is less expensive, simple in primer design and its universal rt-pcr protocols are suitable for multiple target sequences than the 5’-nuclease taqman assay. in this study, a more rapid, simple to operate, and sensitive sybr green real-time rt-pcr assay was developed and evaluated for its accuracy and sensitivity in detecting the avian hev rna in chicken fecal, liver, spleen, and serum samples.

the rt-pcr assays which have been established in the past use almost exclusively primers designed to target the orf <dig> and orf <dig> genes of avian hev. however, sequence alignment showed that the orf <dig> gene is actually the most conserved region of the avian hev genome. consequently, the sybr green real-time pcr assay developed in this study used primers targeting orf <dig> gene. in addition, based on sequence alignment, the 3’ terminal nucleotide sequences used to create these primers are the same in different genotypes of avian hev strains. based on this information this sybr green real-time rt-pcr assay may be used for the universal detection of avian hev.

to compare the sybr green real-time rt-pcr with conventional rt-pcr assays, sequential serum samples were obtained from chickens challenged with cahev, and clinical samples were obtained from chickens with a decrease in egg production. these samples were tested simultaneously with the two assays. for the sequential serum samples, viral rna was detected as a sign of infection. the sybr green real-time rt-pcr assay proved to be more sensitive than conventional rt-pcr, as viral rna was detected over a larger range of time during the progression of infection compared to conventional rt-pcr . for the  <dig> clinical samples, only  <dig> samples were found to be positive using conventional rt-pcr, while  <dig> were identified as positive using sybr green real-time rt-pcr . these present data indicated that this newly validated assay is more sensitive than the conventional rt-pcr for early detection and surveillance of avian hev infection in chickens. this development will be economically important for the poultry industry in the prevention of losses due to hev infection.

CONCLUSIONS
a sybr green real-time rt-pcr assay for the detection and quantification of avian hev rna was developed. this assay was proven to be efficient, specific, reproducible, and more sensitive than conventional rt-pcr in the detection of avian hev rna from serum, liver, spleen, and fecal samples. effective disease management relies on diagnostic kits to confirm viral infection early and accurately. in this regard, the commercial availability of this assay may be useful for the diagnosis and management of avian hev infection in poultry farms.
