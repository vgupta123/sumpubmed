BACKGROUND
regulation of gene expression is performed on several levels: transcription , translation  and the post-translational modifications. gene transcription is usually controlled by the interaction between regulatory factors and a regulatory dna sequence located mostly on the up-stream of the transcription starting site. this regulatory region contains a short dna sequence to which the gene regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors , bind in order to activate/repress the gene expression <cit> . the dna of eukaryotic cells is packaged into nucleosomes which build up chromatin. the dna in the nucleosomes is not as readily accessible to binding of proteins like transcription factors as in naked dna. the dna packaging, nucleosome positioning and remodeling have been suggested to be mechanisms to control protein-dna interactions involved in the transcription, replication and recombination  <cit> . the nucleosome positioning is coordinated by complex processes such as dna-dna interaction, protein-dna interaction, histone modification, and chromatin remodeling <cit> . recent genome-wide experiments have generated high resolution genomic map of nucleosome locations in multiple species including yeast <cit> , drosophila <cit>  and humans <cit> . a few computational methods <cit>  have been used to investigate chromatin dynamics.

for silicon identification of the transcription factor binding sites, a pioneering work by bussemaker et al.  <cit>  suggests a linear regression model to infer the binding motifs of tfs on the regulatory region by combining high-throughput microarray data with dna sequence information. recent research in the field is integrating the biophysical model with the computational identification of tf binding sites  <cit> . though the statistical-mechanical theory of selection of the dna binding sites has been used for almost two decades <cit> , the application of such an old theory in a new way  has generated numerous new algorithms. most of these early developed methods are based on an assumption of low protein concentration, i.e., only the strongest dna binding sites are bound by proteins. thus, the protein binding probability in the models, namely matrixreduce <cit> , mars <cit> , prego <cit> , precise physical models <cit> , bart <cit>  and csi-tree <cit> , is approximated by maxwell-boltzmann probability. the protein binding probability is dependent on the average number of proteins in a cell  <cit> . for a full biophysical modeling of protein-dna interaction without the low protein concentration assumption, a term called chemical potential has been introduced <cit> . the chemical potential is equivalent to the concentration of each protein inside a cell and can be changed when the protein binding probability varies in the cell  <cit> . fermi-dirac form of protein binding probability suggests that a dna sequence with binding energy far below the chemical potential is always bound to a protein. in contrary, if the binding energy is well above the chemical potential then the sequence is rarely bound <cit> . to build a full biophysical model for identifying protein binding sites using a high-throughput microarray dataset, a novel computational approach by incorporating the chemical potential with the protein binding probability is developed.

except for the protein binding probability issue mentioned above, an improvement of the parameter fitting for a protein binding probability may also increase the accuracy of in silico prediction of protein-dna interactions. usually, the parameter estimation  is a nonlinear optimization problem <cit> . an exact model fitting of such nonlinear parameters by using a regression method is not possible <cit> , which may suffer from "over-learning" <cit> . though the nonlinear parameter fitting is an important issue in designing a computer algorithm, it has rarely been addressed before <cit> . we could use "cross-validation" and "early stopping" roles to partially overcome the obstacle. however, the best solution to deal with the nonlinear parameter fitting is a bayesian method   <cit>  which has been proven to be a robust and comprehensible procedure to search for models that are better matched to the data.

we developed a new approach, a combination of bayesian parameter inference, fermi-dirac form of protein binding probability and genome-wide positioning of nucleosome. the real value of our new program - bayespi - was assessed on synthetic datasets and genome-wide chip-chip data. we also investigated the condition-dependent modification of protein binding energy matrices as well as the protein binding parameters  by using the proposed new method. in earlier works, the protein binding parameters were seldom studied  <cit> . particularly, few researchers have taken the advantage of using genome-wide tf occupancy data  <cit>  to investigate either condition-specific or species-specific protein binding parameters. through a systemic study of the protein binding parameters under different experimental conditions or across several related species, we may uncover certain crucial mechanisms behind the complex genome expression and regulation  <cit> .

RESULTS
validation of bayespi using synthetic chip-chip datasets
for an initial trial, we tested bayespi on  <dig> synthetic chip-chip datasets where various lengths of binding motifs were implanted in synthetic dna sequences. in figure  <dig>  we illustrated the results of these tests by a scatter plot of the motif similarity score as a function of the sequence length. the result indicates that the performance of bayespi is quite robust against either the sequence length or the target motif size. all motif similarity scores are between  <dig>  and  <dig> , except for two cases with smaller motif similarity scores than the others. in these two cases, we found that the target motifs were long , suggesting that the long binding site may severely hinder the computational prediction of motif targets. to estimate good or bad motif matches, we identified a threshold value for the motif similarity score. for example, a similarity score >  <dig>  represents a reasonable match between a pair of motifs. a score <  <dig>  suggests a poor match . such a threshold value, which has been used in a previous work  <cit> , will be applied to compare the motif similarities among various predictions in follow-up studies.

validation of the bayespi using real chip-chip datasets
after success on the synthetic datasets, we applied bayespi on the real protein-dna interaction datasets from chip-chip experiments in rich medium conditions  <cit> . we applied the same search strategy used in the synthetic datasets to find putative tf binding energy matrix for  <dig> selected yeast tfs. by comparing the putative tf binding energy matrix of each tf with the corresponding sgd  consensus sequences, we found that ~ <dig> % of our predicted tf energy matrices had motif similarity scores greater than  <dig> . the result demonstrates that the majority of our defined putative tf binding energy matrices  bear good resemblance to the "known" sgd motifs.

matrixreduce <cit> , a statistical mechanical model for genome-wide occupancy data, was used to compute the sequence specificities of  <dig> yeast transcription factor binding sites in rich medium conditions. these predicted position-specific affinity matrices  were published in an online database, transfactomedb <cit> . in the theoretical background, matrixreduce and bayespi share several similarities. they, however, have two major differences: i) the earlier approach does not use bayesian method to control the fitting of model parameters by using least squares; ii) the protein binding probability of matrixreduce is approximated by a maxwell-boltzmann distribution with an assumption of very low protein concentration, but such an assumption in bayespi is lifted <cit> . therefore, a comparison between the transfactomedb psam and the sgd consensus sequences may provide insights on improving the model if we utilize a fermi-dirac form of protein binding probability to interrogate the same tf occupancy data <cit> . among all available tfs in the transfactomedb, we only compared  <dig> of them  with sgd consensus sequences. the result showed that there were ~50% good matches between the transfactomedb psam and the sgd consensus sequences. in other words, bayespi did improve the prediction accuracy by considering both bayesian inference and the fermi-dirac form of protein binding probability  <cit> .

a number of binding sequence specificity information for dna-binding proteins has been published. in particular, the sequence specificity data for yeast, transfac <cit>  and a publication by macisaac et al. <cit>  have been extensively used. the former is a manually created database that contains experimentally measured position weight matrices for particular dna-binding proteins. the later is a recent refinement of yeast regulatory sites using two conservation-based motif discovery algorithms to reanalyze the genome-wide chip-chip data  <cit> . the sequence specificity information of  <dig> yeast tfs examined in this work are available in the collection from macisaac et al. , but that of  <dig> tfs are found in the transfac database. comparisons of the two sequence specificity datasets with the present gold standard  showed that the percentage of motif similarity scores greater than  <dig>  was ~87% for macisaac et al. and ~100% for transfac, respectively. this suggests that the quality of our predicted position-specific energy matrices using bayespi is as good as the two most popular yeast sequence specificity repositories.

prediction of protein binding energy matrices by taking nucleosome positioning in consideration
as mentioned earlier, nucleosome occupancy affects transcription by decreasing the accessibility of dna to protein binding. thus, including nucleosome density may improve computational identification of protein binding sites using in vivo protein-dna interaction datasets. based on a modified protein binding probability , we tested bayespi on a set of chip-chip experiments on  <dig> yeast tfs under rich medium conditions. it has been shown that three  of the  <dig> tfs are not functional while the other seven are active under the growth conditions. interestingly, we found that inferred protein binding energy matrices of the three non-functional tfs were poor , even if the binding of proteins is associated with the nucleosome-depleted region  and the nucleosome positioning information is considered in the program. of the seven active tfs, five  showed either improved rank orders or increased motif similarity scores for the best motif when the nucleosome weighted protein binding probability was used, in which both swi4-bound and leu3-bound loci are known nucleosome-poor <cit> . experimental work has suggested that the low nucleosome occupancy at loci bound by leu <dig> is not a consequence of leu <dig> binding <cit> . two tfs, rap <dig> and abf <dig> are global regulatory proteins and can open chromatin in the vicinity of their binding sites  <cit> , and did not show major improvements in the quality of their inferred binding energy matrices  although both tfs are known to bind nucleosome-depleted promoters. these outcomes indicate that the inclusion of the nucleosome information in the computation does improve the performance of bayespi. however, the improvement is tf dependent because the activities of different tfs in the transcription are affected by the nucleosome position differently. it is to be noted that the effect of the inclusion of the nucleosome positioning information in silico motif prediction was not strong if a tf  is non-functional under certain growth conditions.

protein binding parameters in the bayespi prediction and other in silico calculations for a set of  <dig> yeast tfs
we have shown that the tf binding energy matrices derived from bayespi are consistent with the known sequence specificities. the new method is robust on both synthetic simulated datasets and real tf occupancy datasets. however, there are several protein binding parameters  need to be verified. aurell et al.  <cit>  calculated transcription factor concentrations  and the corresponding minimal binding energies  for  <dig> yeast tfs in rich medium conditions. they used two separate methods, the classical work of berg and von hippel  <cit>   and an approximation of recently introduced quadratic programming method of energy matrix estimation  <cit>  , to estimate the minimal binding energy of a specific tf. bvh does not include chemical potential. qpmeme may estimate the chemical potential but it fails if the measured tf abundance  <cit> nobs is too low. as shown in , both bayespi  and bvh gave solutions to all  <dig> tfs in rich medium conditions but qpmeme only solved  <dig> of them due to the internal limitation of the method  <cit> . a comparison between bp and qpmeme shows that ~57% of estimated minimal energies  and ~57% of predicted chemical potential  have a reasonable match. following the same threshold , a comparison between bp and bvh reveals that ~64% of predicted minimal binding energies  have a good match. however, a comparison between qpmeme and bvh shows only ~52% of the predicted minimal energies  have good correlations. thus, the estimation by bp is more consistent with the bvh prediction than the qpmeme estimation. this may be explained by the similarity of the biophysical background behind both bp and bvh methods <cit> . figure  <dig> shows scatter plots of the above comparisons across three methods. the results indicate that the estimated protein binding parameters of  <dig> yeast tfs in rich medium conditions are comparable among three different calculations .

computation of condition-specific protein binding parameters for yeast tfs
as shown above, the tf binding energy matrices computed by bp are consistent with the sgd consensus sequences. particularly, the calculated tf binding parameters  by bp are in line with the other calculations in yeast under rich medium conditions . thus, we could apply the new method to investigate condition-dependent tf binding parameters, i.e., stress-specific protein binding parameters. here we selected four yeast tfs  from in vivo chip-chip experiments <cit> . these tfs are known to be required for activation of the stress-induced gene transcription. for example,  msn <dig>  a zinc finger protein, is a transcriptional activator of the multi-stress responses in s. cerevisiae  <cit>  such as heat shock , oxidative stress , glucose starvation  and sorbic acid   <cit> . our estimation in figure  <dig> shows that the chemical potential and minimal binding energy of msn <dig>  were increased due to h2o <dig>  heat and rapa but not with acid.  rox <dig>  a heme-dependent repressor of hypoxic genes, may repress its own expression by binding its own upstream region to prevent the accumulation of excess rox <dig> in the cell under high oxygen levels <cit> . here we found an increasing of rox <dig> binding parameters under hyperoxic conditions  relative to the ypd. such increasing to high hyperoxic condition  was relatively smaller than that to low hyperoxic condition  . the result may reflect a self-repression role of rox <dig> to control its own cellular level  <cit> .  yap <dig>  <cit>  and skn <dig>  <cit>  are essential for resistance to oxidative stress  response but do not always function together in the activation of h2o2-inducible genes  <cit> . here we observed that the minimal binding energy and chemical potential for yap <dig> were decreasing while those for skn <dig> were increasing under heat and hyperoxic conditions although the responses were weak . these results are in agreement with previous reports which found yap <dig> and skn <dig> cooperatively control several h2o <dig> target genes, exerting the same or opposite effects <cit> . it is worth noting that the protein binding parameters for each tf investigated responded in essentially the same pattern to each stress.

in a recent work, harbison et al <cit>  had characterized several types of environment-specific binding for yeast transcriptional regulators: condition-invariant, condition-enabled, condition-expanded, and condition-altered binding behaviors. we are particularly interested in the last three because these binding events are dynamically changed during a shift of a condition. for example, the stress response factor msn <dig> belongs to a condition-enabled binding as shown above . we have used the bp method to estimate the protein binding energy matrices  and the corresponding binding parameters  for the last three types of condition-specific bindings. here is an overview of the results: i) for condition-enabled binding protein msn <dig> in rich medium condition, we found a marginal match between the inferred binding energy matrices and the sgd consensus sequence . however, under the oxidative stress known as an activation condition  for msn <dig>  we found the inferred binding energy matrices changed in both binding parameters  and shape  but still had good resemblance to the "known" consensus sequence ; ii) for condition-expanded binding factor gcn <dig>  under different conditions , and nutrient deprived ), the binding energy matrices were similar to each other  as well as to the sgd consensus sequence . particularly, the predicted binding parameters under different conditions did not show any dramatic changes ; iii) for condition-altered regulators ste <dig> under different conditions, we not only observed a strong variation of the shape of tf binding energy matrices  but also found a clear alteration of the corresponding binding parameters , though motif similarity scores were all good .

minimal binding energy  ebp and chemical potential ubp are estimated by the bayespi using chip-chip experimental data under various conditions  <cit> , such as rich medium condition , a high hyperoxic , a moderate hyperoxic , amino acid starvation , nutrient deprived , filamentation inducing  and mate inducing .

the description of each condition is similar to that in table  <dig>  the |Δe| or |Δμ| is the absolute difference between the paired minimal binding energies or chemical potential  divided by their mean minimal binding energy or mean chemical potential, respectively.

considering these results together, we hypothesize that for condition-enabled regulators there is a clear difference between to bind  and not to bind  via sequence specificity once the binding condition is reached. however, for condition-altered regulators the variation of sequence specificity between different conditions is less distinguishable. in other words, condition-altered bindings may share close sequence specificity among various conditions but the binding affinity of each individual binding site may have position-specific variation, for example, dimers tg and ca in the ste <dig> binding sites . nevertheless, condition-expanded regulators not only share the same sequence specificity among different conditions but also keep similar binding parameters in various environments such as gcn <dig> . thus, we speculate that the condition-altered regulators  may represent a set of the most active tfs in a cell since they regulate a large number of diverse set of genes under different conditions by cooperating with many other transcription regulators <cit> . such diverse binding activities of condition-altered regulators may benefit from the great flexibility of their binding parameters .

estimation of species-specific protein binding parameters for yeast tfs
so far we have characterized the property of the environment-dependent transcription factor binding parameters for several yeast tfs. the results suggest that both tf binding parameters and the corresponding motif binding energy matrices may undergo environment-specific modifications. it is interesting to see whether such modification of protein binding parameters would be in a species-specific manner. for that reason, we obtained chip-chip datasets and the relevant dna sequence information from an investigation on ste <dig> and tec <dig> binding sties across three related yeast species  under the same pseudohyphal conditions  <cit> . here we used the bp method to compute both binding energy matrices and binding parameters for the above two tfs across the three species. the estimated binding parameters of each tf for each replicated chip-chip experiment for each yeast species are listed in table  <dig>  we found that at least two of the triplicate experiments for either ste <dig> or tec <dig> showed similar binding parameters in both smik and sbay, which suggests a good reproducibility of the predictions . the recovered binding energy matrices of the three experiments in each species also showed similarity . especially, motif similarity scores were good for all  <dig> chip-chip experiments, except for one case where the motif similarity score was less than  <dig> . thus, the sequence specificity for either ste <dig> or tec <dig> does share similarities across the three species but the protein binding parameters bear a species-specific variation.

minimal binding energy  ebp and chemical potential ubp are estimated by the bayespi based on chip-chip experimental data from s. cerevisiae , s. mikatae , and s. bayanus  under pseudohyphal conditions. r represents replicated experiment, and d means dye-swapped experiment.

the description of each species is similar to that in table  <dig>  the |Δe| or |Δμ| is the absolute difference between the paired minimal binding energies or chemical potential  divided by their mean minimal binding energy or mean chemical potential, respectively. the predicted protein binding parameters with motif similarity score <  <dig>  was not considered in the comparison.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we have developed a new computational method, bayespi , to study protein-dna interaction by using high-throughput yeast chip-chip microarray. validation of the bp method on both synthetic datasets and real experimental data shows that bp is robust. comparisons of protein binding parameters  of  <dig> yeast tfs obtained by bp with the estimations from previous models give good correlations . in particular, the newly introduced protein binding parameters in the bp method provide an extra dimension to explore the complex transcription regulation. for example, the method allows us to observe the change of protein binding energy matrices under different conditions, and the modification of both protein binding energy and associated chemical potential after environmental perturbations . the elasticity of the protein binding parameters under different environments is also found to be true in a species-specific manner  which may be used to judge the phylogenetical distance among species . particularly, we noticed the position-specific variation of protein binding affinities at a few key binding sites when being exposed either to a new environment or to another species. for example, the pyrimidine-purine dimers yr  in the ste <dig> consensus are the most flexible nucleotides with respect to the binding affinity changes. an early dna sequence-dependent deformability study from protein-dna crystal complexes also suggests the same yr dimers are the most flexible base pairs on the dna sequences <cit> . such sequence-dependent structural effects in the dna duplexes may indicate that certain nucleotides in the dna are more flexible and influenced by their surroundings  <cit> .

in addition to the variation of the individual nucleotide affinity in protein binding sites, we also observed a similar modification in the flanking sequence such as the nucleotide adjacent to the right side of tec <dig> binding site c, t, and g in scer, smik and sbay, respectively . this is in line with a previous proposal of that the flanking sequence variation may affect the energy required for dna distortion, the binding affinity of the nearby protein binding sites may be either increased or decreased, and consequently may influence protein-dna regulation <cit> . the significance of such flanking sequences variation for gene expression and regulations was also suggested in a few recent studies. for example, alternative transcriptional regulation by a2-mcm <dig> binding in different yeast species  <cit>  and disruption of p53-mdm <dig> oscillation by sp <dig> binding in the human mdm <dig> promoter  <cit>  have been reported. therefore, the variation of nucleotide in either protein recognition sequence or flanking sites may result in a change in protein binding affinity  <cit>  by responding to different conditions, which lead to distinct gene expression patterns <cit> . this may also explain the adaptive modification of protein binding parameters in both environment-specific  and species-specific protein-dna interactions . the newly introduced protein binding parameters are possible phenotypes of binding sites' evolution as well as of function and non-function protein binding sites.

the new approach, the bayesian model regularization, has overcome an important obstacle in nonlinear parameter fitting: for example, both matrixreduce <cit>  and precise physical models <cit>  are required to rescale their results  to normalize the matrix elements range between  <dig> and  <dig>  the rational of the rescaling of the energy matrix is vaguely explained in the earlier publications. however, we knew that the above problem is often caused by non-convergence  of nonlinear parameter fitting . in such a case, previous methods have to rescale the parameters after the calculation is completed, but the bayesian approach can control the parameters online by searching for model parameters that are better matched to the data <cit> . the performance of the bayespi is definitely improved by considering the bayesian method.

finally, the prediction of protein binding parameters using bayespi is promising. however, the power of applying a biophysical model for protein-dna interaction still has room for improvement. here are three possible directions to make bayespi more useful in the future: 1) for the current implementation of the bayesian nonlinear parameter fitting, we used gaussian approximation for probability distribution to estimate the model parameters. however, not all datasets are suited for the gaussian approximation, thus, a markov chain monte carlo sampling of probability distribution may be considered in the future <cit> ; 2) for the computation of protein binding energy matrix by using the biophysical model, we assumed that every base contributes independently to the protein binding, which means the total energy of the interaction is only the sum of the energies of the individual contact. though such additive assumption may provide good approximation to the true nature of the protein-dna interactions <cit> , experimental observations had recommended that the future computational methods should take into account the non-independence of bases in the nucleotides of the protein binding sites <cit> . for example, a biophysical model with a pair-dependent correction of the energy matrix may give better description of the true binding site specificities <cit> ; 3) for the identification of the functional regulatory binding sites, the protein binding probability is not the only factor to define them; other variables including adjacent co-regulator binding sites, distance from the transcriptional start site, genome conservation and nucleosome positioning may affect the degree of function of a binding site. for these reasons, future algorithms should use sophisticated methods to include at least some of the additional variables discussed.
