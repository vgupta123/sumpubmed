BACKGROUND
the β2-agonist clenbuterol  is used as a bronchodilator for the treatment of asthma in humans and as a bronchodilator as well as a tocolytic agent in veterinary medicine  <cit> . in the past decade, high dosages of clenbuterol  have been fed to livestock to improve feed conversion, reduce body fat and increase muscle mass  <cit> . however, people who eat the animal products can be poisoned by the clenbuterol residues  <cit> . therefore, the use of clenbuterol for growth promotion in food-producing animals is not approved within china, the european community, the united states, and most other countries  <cit> .

clenbuterol influences cell metabolism by combining with β2-adrenergic receptors and by increasing the camp concentration in cells. in adipocytes, stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors  increases cyclic amp levels and activates protein kinase a , which stimulates lipolysis by phosphorylating hormone-sensitive lipase and perilipin  <cit> . however the molecular level mechanism by which clenbuterol influences adipose accumulation is still not understood.

recently, global gene/protein expression analysis techniques using dna microarray/2-d gel analyses have been widely used to define the characteristics and specific patterns of gene expressions elicited by various toxicants  <cit> . in this study, the molecular level mechanism by which clenbuterol reduces fat accumulation was studied with cdna microarray and proteomics techniques to analyze the fat tissue of chinese miniature pigs treated with/without clenbuterol.

RESULTS
adipose accumulation decreased dramatically by clenbuterol administration
hplc analyses of blood samples showed that the clenbuterol concentrations in the test pigs fed with clenbuterol were about  <dig> ng/ml in the  <dig> month-old pigs and about  <dig> ng/ml in the  <dig> month-old pigs. clenbuterol could not be detected in the control pigs fed without clenbuterol . the test pigs and control pigs did not exhibit different weights , but did exhibit different body compositions . the effect of clenbuterol on body composition became more dramatic with advancing age. in the  <dig> month-old group, the lean meat percentage was increased by 2%, the back fat thickness was reduced by ~ <dig>  cm, and the loin muscle area was reduced by  <dig>  cm <dig>  this difference was statistically significant . in the  <dig> month-old group, the lean meat percentage was increased by  <dig> %, the back fat thickness was reduced by  <dig>  cm and the loin muscle area was reduced by  <dig>  cm <dig>  the changes of the lean meat percentage and the loin muscle area were strongly statistically significant  while the changes of the back fat thickness were statistically significant . these data indicate that clenbuterol plays a role in pig adipose reduction. the sample quality was sufficient for further analysis to identify molecules with changed expression levels and molecules which impact adipose accumulation.

*twice daily with the unit of 

the carcass lean meat percentage, the back fat thickness and the loin muscle area were all changed statistically in both the  <dig> month-old group and the  <dig> month-old group after clenbuterol treatment .

muscle fibers became thicker and adipose cells became smaller with the administration of clenbuterol
clenbuterol produces specific protein anabolic effects in skeletal muscle in addition to lipolysis in adipose tissue of various vertebrates  <cit> . however, there has not yet been any research explaining how these two types of tissues are changed by the administration of clenbuterol. muscle and adipose histological sections were analyzed to understand how these two tissue types are changed .

paraffin histological section analyses were done using samples from the  <dig> month-old pig's biceps femoris. four histological section slides were prepared for each pig, two transverse muscle fiber slides and two longitudinal muscle fiber slides, for analysis of the cross-sectional area of the fibers with a td <dig> real-color pathology image analysis system . the cross-sectional areas of the muscle fibers of the test pigs and the control pigs were significantly different with a student t-test p value of  <dig>  . the results show that the administration of clenbuterol increased the muscle fiber thicknesses in the pigs.

the  <dig> month-old pig's back fat tissue  was also analyzed using paraffin histological section. five random areas on the slides were chosen for the adipose cell size analyses. the cell sizes were analyzed by counting all the cells on the slides visible through the microscope eyepiece at the  <dig> ×  <dig> magnification . numbers of cells in the test group were strongly statistically more than in the control group . thus, clenbuterol caused a reduction in adipocyte size.

the clenbuterol thickened the pig muscle fibers and reduced the sizes of the pig adipocyte cells in the back fat tissues. clenbuterol is known to increase muscle mass and reduce body fat. we suggest that clenbuterol increases the muscle mass by thickening the muscle fibers and reduces the body fat by shrinking the adipose cells. the size of the adipose cells depends on the sizes of the lipid droplets in the cells. therefore, the adipose cells become smaller as the clenbuterol reduces the lipid droplets in the adipose cells.

cdna microarray identified  <dig> genes with changed mrna abundance in adipose tissue with stimulation by clenbuterol
eight microarray slides were used  for global evaluation of the gene expression in the adipose tissue after administration of clenbuterol.  <dig> spots representing  <dig> genes  in the  <dig> month-old group and  <dig> spots representing  <dig> genes  in the  <dig> month-old group passed the spots quality filter and were analyzed with the student t test.  <dig> genes in the  <dig> month-old group  and  <dig> genes in the  <dig> month-old group  were differentially expressed . the goal of this study was to identify gene expression profiles affected by clenbuterol. therefore, genes that were differentially expressed in both groups  were selected for further study as being differentially expressed in adipose tissue with stimulation by clenbuterol .

these  <dig> genes  were divided into  <dig> groups according to their gene ontology biological process descriptions.  <dig> genes were cellular metabolism related genes ,  <dig> were signal transduction related genes ,  <dig> were expressed sequence tags    and the other  <dig> genes were of various categories .  <dig> est sequences were deposited at dbest of ncbi  <cit> .

73% cdna microarray results confirmed by real-time pcr
seven differentially expressed genes  were chosen for real-time pcr analysis with the  <dig> month-old group samples used to validate the microarray data . clone rpfat_ <dig> and rpfat_ <dig> representing pro-alpha- <dig> type  <dig> collagen were not detected by the real-time pcr. the other five clones, for genes of apod , prkar1a , col1a <dig>  and col1a <dig>  collagen), showed a statistically significant increase in mrna abundance with administration of clenbuterol .

five of the seven genes were confirmed by real-time pcr.

the scd  and hsl  genes are very important in lipid metabolism. the mrna abundance of stearoyl-coa desaturase  decreased in the  <dig> month-old group and increased in the  <dig> month-old group, while hsl was not significantly differentially expressed by stimulation with clenbuterol in the microarray analysis. pmp <dig>  and phpt <dig>  were also not significantly differentially expressed by stimulation with clenbuterol in the microarray analysis. these four genes  were not significantly differentially expressed by the real-time pcr analysis with  <dig> pig samples  . in total,  <dig> genes were analyzed by the real-time pcr. eight genes showed similar induction magnitude as that seen in the microarray data; two could not be detected, and one was inconsistent with the microarray results. thus, these results provide strong biological validation of the results from the microarray experiment.

apolipoprotein r protein highly presented in adipose with the administration of clenbuterol
after spot detection, background subtraction and volume normalization,  <dig> ±  <dig> protein spots were detected in adipose cells using two-dimensional electrophoresis methods. two spots found to be only expressed in the test group were chosen for digestion in-gel for peptide mass fingerprint  analysis with a mass spectrograph . a mascot search using the pmf data matched seven of the peptides with peptides from apolipoprotein r, with a sequence coverage of 36% and an expectation of  <dig>   <cit> . the other differentially expressed protein did not give any positive results in the database search.

discussion
to identify the genes responding to clenbuterol treatment in adipose tissue, a cdna microarray, real-time pcr and 2-dimensional protein gel analysis were used.  <dig> genes were identified as being differentially expressed by the microarray analysis with student t test . these were categorized into to four groups.

lipid metabolism related genes in group i
 <dig> differentially expressed genes are involved in cellular metabolism . five of them, including apod , apor , had , pap type 2a isoform  <dig>  and scd , directly participate in lipid metabolism.

both apod and apor were up-regulated by the administration of clenbuterol. apod is a component of high density lipoproteins  <cit> . apor is a 23-kda protein found on very low-density lipoproteins , on chylomicrons, and in the d >  <dig>  g/ml fraction of pig plasma  <cit> . apor was also found to be up-regulated by proteomic analysis. although the physiologic functions of apod and apor in adipose tissue are unknown, they may respond to clenbuterol stimulation to alter lipid metabolism.

type  <dig> paps appear to metabolize a wide range of lipid mediators derived from both glycero- and sphingolipids  <cit> . scd is the enzyme responsible for conversion of saturated fatty acids into monounsaturated fatty acids  in mammalian adipocytes  <cit> . had is a mitochondrial protein that catalyzes the oxidation of a wide variety of fatty acids, alcohols, and steroids  <cit> .

the identification of these molecules is not sufficient to draw out the clenbuterol physiological pathway. however, with the study of the ests in table  <dig>  some new functional genes related to lipid metabolism will be identified. the mechanism of clenbuterol reducing fat accumulation will be revealed on the molecular level based on these differentially expressed genes.

other cellular metabolism related genes in group i
of the other cellular metabolism related genes, eef1a  is responsible for the enzymatic delivery of aminoacyl trnas to the ribosome. eef1a up-regulation indicates that translation activity in adipose cells is enhanced by clenbuterol stimulation. aarchain  <dig> may be involved in vesicle structure or trafficking  <cit>  and its up regulation suggests that transport of cargos from the endoplasmic reticulum  to the golgi was enhanced. cathepsin b is a lysosomal cysteine proteinase composed of a dimer with disulfide-linked heavy and light chains. d1s155e , smarca <dig>  and kiaa <dig>  modulate the frequency, rate or extent of dna-dependent transcription.

together, these findings indicate that some metabolic processes, such as dna transcription, protein translation and protein translocation, were enhanced in the adipose cells by clenbuterol stimulation.

camp signaling pathway related genes in group ii
the beta-androgenic receptor  signal pathway has been well described previously  <cit> . clenbuterol as a beta-agonist works by binding with β-ar which then transmits signals into the cell along the g protein-mediated camp signal pathway  <cit> . however, the molecular level mechanisms by which clenbuterol affects adipose accumulation are still unknown. to examine the expression level of genes related to camp or g-protein, a total of  <dig> genes were found directly related to camp or g-protein in the microarray gene list. only two of the eleven were found to be up-regulated, the camp dependent protein kinase type i regulatory gene  and rab <dig> . up-regulation of prkar1a was confirmed by the real-time pcr. no reports have been found concerning functions of prkar1a and rba <dig> in adipose cells.

other signal transduction related genes in group ii
another seven signal transduction genes were found to be differentially expressed . five genes  encoding signal transduction molecules are calcium related. this indicates that clenbuterol may have an impact on calcium signaling pathways in cells. both rack <dig> and wnt3a activate protein kinase c, while protein kinase a has previously been reported as the target of clenbuterol. all this data suggests that clenbuterol's effects on adipose cell may be more complex than previously suggested.

fibromodulin participates in the assembly of the extracellular matrix as it interacts with type i and type ii collagen fibrils  <cit> . several collagen genes were also found to be up-regulated . this indicates that clenbuterol may have an effect on cell collagen synthesis which may alter the cell matrix composition. it is difficult to determine whether this has any relationship to trigalloyl glycerol accumulation.

ests sequence in group iv
 <dig> differentially expressed ests are listed in table  <dig>  specific conclusions can not be derived from these ests results at this time. some key genes for lipid metabolism, which are unknown at this time, may be found from this list in the future.

clenbuterol stimulates genes up-regulated
only three genes were found to be down-regulated in the  <dig> differentially expressed genes. to further investigate whether some genes were down-regulated by the administration of clenbuterol, phpt <dig>  and pmp <dig>  were analyzed by real-time pcr . these two genes were down-regulated in the  <dig> month-old group , but they were not statistically differentially expressed in the  <dig> month-old group  by the microarray analysis. the pcr results showed that the mrna expression of these two genes were not changed significantly  which confirms the unusual microarray result that very few genes were suppressed. this data suggests that clenbuterol stimulates gene up-regulation in adipose cells.

CONCLUSIONS
pig fat accumulation was reduced dramatically with clenbuterol treatment. histological sections and global evaluation of gene expression after administration of clenbuterol in pigs identified profound changes in adipose cells. with clenbuterol stimulation, adipose cell volumes decreased and their gene expression profile changed, which indicate some metabolism processes have been also altered. although the biological functions of the differentially expressed genes are not completely known, higher expressions of these molecules in adipose tissue might contribute to the reduction of fat accumulation. among these genes, five lipid metabolism related genes were of special interest for further study, including apod and apor. the apor expression was increased at both the rna and protein levels. the apor may be one of the critical molecules through which clenbuterol reduces fat accumulation.
