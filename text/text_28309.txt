BACKGROUND
dramatic declines in amphibian populations in wetlands have been described worldwide since the 1980s
 <cit> , with current extinction rates reaching levels that are  <dig> times higher than background levels
 <cit> . despite lengthy debate about causative agents responsible for this species decline, theoretical and empirical research has confirmed the complex cross-effects of anthropogenic activities on the survival of amphibians through habitat loss, the introduction of exotic species, increased uv radiation, water acidification, emerging infectious diseases and multi-pollution
. some field studies using landscape-scale data have suggested that chemical contaminants may correlate with population declines in several amphibian species
. therefore, chemical contaminants were proposed as one of the key contributing factors altering amphibian population fitness
 <cit> . however, the exact mechanisms of population responses to chemical exposure are still poorly understood, leading several authors to consider pollution as a cause of secondary importance
 <cit> .

numerous toxicological studies have reported diverse physiological effects in individuals exposed to pollutants, such as increased mortality, decreased growth rates, malformations, endocrine disruption and immunosuppression
. most of these studies solely investigated larval exposure and focused on pesticides as contaminants
 <cit> . however, freshwater ecosystems are polluted with complex mixtures including emerging and well-known pollutants, like heavy metals, polychlorobiphenyls, personal care products, drugs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , as well as their transformation products. in the case of pahs, several studies have suggested that amphibians exhibit a variety of physiological disorders when exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of pahs  at the larval stage
. however few studies have focused on adult amphibian responses
 and even less on the all-important females on which the resources found in the eggs are entirely dependent
 <cit> . the pah, benzopyrene  is classified as a priority pollutant, based on its known carcinogenicity
 <cit> . the mechanisms causing bap toxicity are linked to its bioactivation through a series of enzymes specifically induced for the metabolism and excretion of bap, as the genes encoding for enzymes are closely- regulated by ahr and nrf <dig> transcription factors
. one deleterious effect of this active metabolism is the generation of genotoxic  and non-genotoxic metabolites, some of which are capable of inducing oxidative stress
 <cit> . since the main bap and other xenobiotic biotransformation reactions take place in the liver, this is also the preferential location for collateral toxic events
 <cit> . it would appear that the bioaccumulation of bap is very pronounced in amphibian species
 <cit> , but adult females exposed to relatively high doses  of bap presented good levels of tolerance to this contaminant due to efficient hepatic detoxification
 <cit> . to date, in the absence of any apparently toxic effects linked to the specific aforementioned bap regulation, no study has assessed the possible hidden harm to female amphibian liver physiology caused by pahs. today, this knowledge gap can be bridged using high throughput sequencing approaches, such as mrna sequencing , recovering information on gene expression over the whole transcriptome from a single experiment
. this technique has recently been shown to be more sensitive, reliable and informative than microarrays for the in vitro evaluation of bap toxicity
 <cit> . in the case of x. tropicalis, the interpretation of large numbers of sequences generated by mrnaseq takes advantage of the recently released complete genome
 <cit> , and benefits from a comprehensive repository from the standard model x. tropicalis, giving access to all levels of sequence data sets, including transcriptomic data
 <cit> . x. tropicalis is easy to maintain, has a short life cycle and is an appropriate model for the analysis of the sublethal effects of toxicants in amphibians
 <cit> . x. tropicalis would therefore appear to be an excellent amphibian model for in-depth studies on the more hidden effects of chemical contaminants, particularly bap, on the female liver at different biological levels.

the objective of this study was to reveal in vivo hepatic responses in x. tropicalis females exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of bap  at the transcriptomic, cellular and physiological levels. due to the dynamic nature of cellular responses, a kinetic approach was applied over a 24-hour exposure period by sequencing mrna at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 24 hours post-exposure. transcriptomic data collected from exposed and non-exposed animals were compared in order to identify hepatic metabolic pathways significantly affected by bap treatment. the metabolic pathways which were found to be enriched at transcriptomic level were studied in detail as regards their chronological activation by bap, and were further associated to cytological and physiological liver phenotype changes over the same time period.

RESULTS
bap uptake and metabolism
bap clearance in the water was used as an indicator of the uptake kinetics in xenopus . the observed decrease in bap concentrations in the water indicated rapid trans-tegumental uptake of the pollutant in the organism with a mean of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg per hour in the first 6 hours. from hour  <dig> to  <dig>  the uptake rate dropped to  <dig>  μg per hour. from hour  <dig> to the end of exposure, no further decrease in bap concentration was observed and a residual concentration of approximately  <dig>  μg.l- <dig> was measured, corresponding to 16% of the initial bap concentration .

hepatic bap metabolism was evaluated by measuring total bap metabolites content in the gall bladder . benzopyrene metabolite concentrations in the gall bladder increased concomitantly with the depletion of bap in the water. the liver metabolism rate drastically increased after 12 hours of exposure, which corresponds to the point of maximum bap depletion from the water. the highest liver metabolism rate was observed from hour  <dig> to  <dig> post-exposure, with 65 ng of bap metabolized per hour.figure  <dig>

sequencing and mapping of cdnas
by sequencing  <dig> cdna libraries from non-exposed control and exposed xenopus to 10 μg.l- <dig> bap at hours  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  a mean of  <dig>  million reads per library were sequenced. approximately 80% of these reads were successfully mapped to the x. tropicalis genome and a mean of  <dig>  million of reads were mapped onto known genes at a single genomic location with no ambiguity . a total of  <dig>  genes were represented by more than  <dig> reads across all libraries . an analysis of transcription levels from hour  <dig> to  <dig> identified  <dig> genes differentially expressed  with a transcript ratio  >  <dig> -fold in either direction at at least one time point during exposure . excepted for hour  <dig> of exposure when the majority of genes were over-transcribed, the distribution of transcription ratios was well balanced between under- and over-transcription with most trs being within a 5-fold variation in either direction. interestingly, only four genes were consistently found to be differentially transcribed at the four time points considered, and an average of  <dig> genes were found consistently differentially transcribed at two or three time points with a maximum of  <dig> genes shared between hour  <dig> and  <dig> . cross-validation of trs from mrna sequencing with real-time quantitative rt-qpcr at each point of exposure revealed a positive correlation between trs obtained from these two techniques in over  <dig> genes studied  .

functional analysis of bap regulated genes and their dynamics during exposure
among the  <dig> genes differently transcribed at at least one time point during bap exposure,  <dig> of them encoded proteins with unknown functions . approximately 20% encoded proteins involved in “signaling/transport” and in “cell death/proliferation processes” . around 29% were assigned to cell metabolism with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes involved in the metabolism of “lipids”, “carbohydrates” and “proteins”, respectively. thirty-four,  <dig> and  <dig> genes encoded proteins involved in “cell structure”, “immunity” and “dna interaction and repair”, respectively. interestingly, only  <dig> genes encoded proteins involved in detoxification processes . in addition, the general transcription pattern clearly indicated over-transcription at 12 hours post-exposure regardless of the gene function considered .

however, a manual annotation only highlights the general functions associated with gene transcription, and does not identify the biochemical pathways in which proteins may be involved. an annotation enrichment analysis was therefore performed in order to determine whether the genes associated with kegg pathways  were significantly over-represented in differentially transcribed genes. an initial assignment of the  <dig> xenopus genes using their ensembl identifiers yielded less than  <dig> % of genes recognized by the functional annotation tool david . to compensate for the small number of directly attributed terms, the xenopus genes detected in our study  were mapped against their closest human orthologs . after manual verification of each gene to check for similarity in terms of function and description,  <dig> % of xenopus genes had human orthologs  of which  <dig>   matched with annotated david gene objects. among the genes found to be significantly differentially transcribed,  <dig> of the  <dig> with known descriptions  matched with annotated david gene objects. annotation enrichment analyses performed on over-transcribed genes indicated a link between bap treatment and “steroid biosynthesis”, “insulin signaling pathway”, “adipocytokines signaling pathway”, “glycolysis/gluconeogenesis” and “mapk signaling pathways” . interestingly, annotation enrichment analyses performed on under-transcribed-genes again indicated a link between bap treatment and “steroid biosynthesis” pathways as well as “tight junction” pathways .table  <dig>

effects of bap on the steroid biosynthesis pathway and lipid metabolism
the enrichment of kegg “steroid biosynthesis” pathway concerned genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis using acetyl-coa as a precursor . the dichotomic link between bap treatment and cholesterol biosynthesis is clearly characterized by two chronological phases of the transcriptional response . genes involved in this pathway appeared over-transcribed at  <dig> and 18 hours post-exposure and under-transcribed at the first  and last  time points considered in the present study. interestingly, this gene transcription time pattern was similarly detected for genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis regulation  as well as in cholesterol depletion from the blood  .figure  <dig>

in the control animals, gall bladder cholesterol concentrations increased from  <dig>  μg.ml- <dig> to  <dig>  μg.ml- <dig> during the first 18 hours and slightly decreased thereafter, reaching  <dig>  μg.ml- <dig> at 24 hours. bile cholesterol concentrations in the bap-exposed animals were  <dig> to  <dig> -fold significantly lower than the controls at  <dig> and 24 hours post-exposure, respectively .

histological data revealed that bap induced an important accumulation of lipid droplets in the liver i.e. steatosis . in bap-treated animals, a significant increase in hepatocyte lipid contents was observed from  <dig> to 18 hours post-exposure followed by a significant decrease at 24 hours. at hours  <dig> and  <dig> of exposure, hepatocyte lipid content was about 6-fold higher in bap-treated animals compared to the controls .

effects of bap on glucose metabolism
more than 50% of the genes linked to “insulin signaling”, “adipocytokines signaling” and “glycolysis/gluconeogenesis” pathway enrichment were shared across these three pathways, suggesting that bap strongly affects glucose metabolism. interestingly, the genes involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis were over-transcribed, especially at 12 hours post-exposure, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  <dig> excepted, which was significantly over-transcribed at  <dig>   <dig> and 24 hours post exposure . three genes involved in fatty acid and lipid metabolism and closely linked to carbohydrate metabolism were found to be over-transcribed at 12 hours post-exposure  and two of them  were found to be under-transcribed at 6 hours post-exposure .

in addition, the monitoring of glucose concentrations in blood indicated a marked hyperglycemia induced by bap at  <dig>   <dig> and 18 hours post-exposure .figure  <dig>

effects of bap on the mapk signaling pathway, hepatocyte apoptosis
genes involved in the “mapk signaling” pathway were found to be over-transcribed at 12 hours post-exposure. only the hps701a gene was also found to be significantly under-transcribed at 6 hours post-exposure . since mapks are typically associated with cell apoptosis and proliferation, a clustering analysis was carried out on all the genes involved in these processes. the vast majority of genes involved in the apoptosis pathway  appeared to be over-transcribed at at least one time point, with 91% over-expressed at 12 hours post-exposure . for genes involved in proliferation processes, the expression pattern was more complex. about 50% of these were over-transcribed at 12 hours post-exposure, whereas 36% were found to be under-transcribed at  <dig> and 24 hours post-exposure .figure  <dig>

the hepatocyte apoptosis was significantly higher in bap-exposed xenopus than in the controls at hours  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> post-exposure. apoptotic hepatocytes were absent or relatively rare in the controls, but their number significantly increased by 20-fold in exposed individuals at 24 hours post-exposure .

liver pigment content is highly variable in amphibians, and its decrease is associated with hepatic stress and hepatocyte apoptosis. x. tropicalis liver is highly pigmented with a maximal pigment area covering  <dig> to 80% of the tissue sections, as observed in the controls. in exposed xenopus, bap induced a marked decrease in liver pigment content from hours  <dig> to  <dig> post-exposure. pigment areas were found to have decreased 3-fold at 18 hours post-exposure .

effects of bap on cell-cell interactions
the “tight junction” pathway appeared to be highly down-regulated at all time points, except at 12 hours with the under-transcription of genes involved in interactions between claudins and actin  and in the transport of claudins to cell membranes . interestingly, this phenomenon was concomitant with an under-transcription of e-cadherin, a key protein involved in adherent junctions . histological examinations of samples stained with hematoxylin and eosin revealed that the hepatic tissue organization appeared to be destructured in bap-treated animals. under magnification, the liver tissue in exposed xenopus displayed hepatocytes with fewer cell contacts and irregular shapes .

discussion
despite evidence suggesting that amphibians are very sensitive to pollutants
 <cit> , their role in the decline of amphibian populations remains unclear
 <cit> . in this study, we used the carcinogenic pollutant bap to attempt to uncover any potential hidden toxic effects it may have on the liver tissue of the amphibian model x. tropicalis under sub-lethal exposure. the concentration of bap used in this study has been calculated based on previous studies on green frogs
 <cit>  and the environmental concentrations of bap likely to occur in highly-polluted sites where frogs are found
 <cit> . here, we emphasize the modulation of the transcriptome and liver cellular/physiological phenotype changes over a 24-hour exposure time period. this short-term exposure has been selected based on the results of previous studies on green frogs
 <cit>  and in order to mimic acute exposure.

recent in vitro studies have clearly illustrated the dynamic regulation occurring at the transcriptomic level during bap exposure and the sequence of events leading to bap toxicity
 <cit> . similarly, our results highlighted remarkable variations in hepatic gene transcription during pollutant exposure, with major changes occurring at 12 hours post-exposure.

the rapid uptake of bap from contaminated water and the early excretion of bap metabolites into the bile observed in the xenopus used in this study, testify to the active involvement of cohorts of specific oxidases, transferases and transport proteins necessary for bap metabolism. however, none of the  <dig> genes differentially transcribed upon bap exposure belonged to the “xenobiotic metabolism” pathway, such as ahr, cyp1a <dig>  gstm <dig> or ugt1a <dig>  moreover, genes associated with biotransformation pathways are known to be involved in the metabolism of endogenous compounds rather than xenobiotics. the induction of bap metabolism enzymes has been previously shown to occur rapidly after pollutant exposure. in the hepatic cellular model hepg <dig> for instance, a rapid increase in the expression of genes involved in “dioxin, xenobiotic metabolism” was observed to drop over the first 9 hours after exposure to 751 μg.l- <dig> of bap
 <cit> . in fish exposed to a high concentration of bap , one of the main oxidases involved in phase i of the bap metabolism process, encoded by the cyp1a gene, was over-transcribed immediately after bap exposure with a high tr of ~  <dig>  decreasing to  <dig> 6 hours post-exposure
 <cit> . the lack of “xenobiotic metabolism” pathway genes in our data might be due to the low concentration of bap applied to xenopus, as well as the relatively long 6-hour period before sampling at the first experimental time point. detecting immediate bap metabolism in x. tropicalis and early gene regulation by this pah is therefore unfeasible. our findings do, however, concur with previous studies on frogs showing rapid fecal elimination of bap and a relatively good tolerance of this xenobiotic
 <cit> . this further suggested that the classical molecular biomarkers of pah exposure, such as cyp1a induction, may not be sufficient to highlight liver responses under short-term exposure at low concentrations.

it is widely known that the liver plays a key role in lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis and cholesterol metabolism. the associated metabolic pathways are closely regulated by insulin or adipocytokines
 <cit> . in our study, a significant enrichment of insulin signaling, adipocytokine signaling, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, steroid  biosynthesis, and mapk signaling pathways was observed; this may relate to late transcriptomic responses to bap exposure in in vitro models
 <cit> . to date, the in vivo kinetics of mechanisms regulated by bap exposure have not been investigated.

the pathways enriched must be considered as a whole and suggest that a possible insulin resistance-like  phenotype occurs rapidly in x. tropicalis exposed to bap. insulin resistance is characterized by an increase in the enzyme-coding transcripts involved in gluconeogenesis, like phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase , and by a sustained hyperglycemia
 <cit> . indeed, we found a marked over-transcription of the pepck gene as early as 6 hours post-bap-exposure, in addition to a marked hyperglycemia at hours  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> post-exposure. these findings were confirmed by the over-transcription in bap-exposed xenopus of the glucose- <dig> phosphatase gene coding for a major gluconeogenic enzyme
 <cit>  and of the glucose transporter glut2
 <cit> . moreover, the high over-transcription we observed at 6 hours post-exposure for the insulin-like growth factor  <dig> binding protein  repressed by insulin in physiological conditions
 <cit> , indicated a marked responsiveness of cell receptors liable to early ir syndrome within a short exposure period. another important physiological feature is the occurrence of liver steatosis, which is the direct consequence of triglyceride accumulation, observed at the earliest time point considered i.e. 6 hours of pollutant exposure. liver steatosis is a well-known consequence of exposure to xenobiotics as evidenced in fish exposed to mercury or large concentrations of bap
 <cit> . moreover, liver steatosis has been shown to occur within a few hours of mammals or amphibians being subjected to chemical or hypoxic stress
. more interestingly, steatosis was shown to be a symptom of ir
 <cit> . based on our transcriptomic results, this phenomenon can be directly related to the under-transcription of sulfotransferase 2b <dig>  at 6 hours post-bap-exposure, an enzyme known to protect the liver from steatosis and to inhibit lipogenesis
 <cit> .

in our study, the majority of hepatic genes modulated on bap exposure led to a significant enrichment of steroid  biosynthesis, with a marked under-transcription at  <dig> and 24 hours, and over-transcription at  <dig> and 18 hours. sustained hyperinsulinemia, a characteristic syndrome of ir, can promote the accumulation of liver cholesterol through the activation of the sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor  <dig> 
 <cit> . indeed, our results indicated a marked over-transcription of srebp-tf <dig> 12 hours post-exposure leading to the over-transcription of hmgcoa reductase and ldlr involved in hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis and cholesterol uptake from blood, respectively, at hours  <dig> and  <dig> post-exposure. this phenomenon has been previously demonstrated in mammals and frogs
 <cit> . consequently, the genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis with acetyl-coa as a precursor were found to be up-regulated. the induction of cholesterol biosynthesis has been previously suggested as a marker of liver toxicity from lead, but the underlying mechanisms have not been explored
 <cit> . in addition, a previous study on mammals
 <cit>  showed that fasting, as implemented in our experimental conditions, induced an increase in cholesterol output in the bile. this phenomenon was observed in the unexposed xenopus from  <dig> to 18 hours after food was withdrawn. however, in exposed animals, a decrease in biliary cholesterol clearly indicated a disruption in cholesterol export through the gall bladder. since hyperinsulinemia is known to induce a reduction in free cholesterol efflux into the bile
 <cit> , this latter result reinforces our hypothesis that ir occurs and is one of the possible causal effects of the cholesterol metabolism disorder observed after 12 hours of exposure to bap.

a major consequence of steatosis and cholesterol accumulation in the liver is the induction of hepatic apoptosis/necrosis. hepatocellular accumulation of lipid droplets predisposes to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species , whereas cholesterol accumulation induces endoplasmic reticulum  stress, ultimately leading to hepatocyte apoptosis/necrosis and autophagy
 <cit> . in our study, liver steatosis and the induction of the cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake pathways were accompanied by the induction of hepatocyte apoptosis, a loss in liver pigments and an induction of ros scavenger enzyme-coding gene expression, such as catalase. the amphibian livers are characterized by the presence of large quantities of pigments synthesized by melano-macrophagic cells. pigment content in the liver is highly dynamic and varies according to natural  or pathological  conditions. a decrease in liver pigments has been previously associated with metabolic stress, apoptosis and autophagy
 <cit> . overall, our results indicated that the perturbation of lipid metabolism induced by bap was responsible for lipotoxic phenomena including er stress, ros production and apoptosis. these results were confirmed by a high over-transcription of pro-apoptotic genes 
 <cit>  and the down-regulation of genes involved in tight and adherent junctions
 <cit> . in the liver, the cohesion of parenchymal hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells is maintained by apical junctional complexes, such as tight and adherent junctions
 <cit> . the irregular shape and loose contact with neighboring cells that were observed, corroborated by the down-regulation of junction-linked genes, could be attributed to the induction of apoptotic processes
 <cit> .

among the key proteins which regulate apoptosis/proliferation, mapks are closely linked to insulin signaling in the liver. previous studies have described changes in the liver in response to insulin including glycolysis induction and mapk–erk signaling pathway leading to cell proliferation
 <cit> . however, the mapk signaling pathway is classically defined as a key regulator of the cellular balance between apoptosis and proliferation
 <cit> . our results highlight the transcription of key oncogenes involved in cell proliferation  and apoptosis . these results suggest a possible balance between cell proliferation induced by hyperinsulinemia, and apoptosis induced by lipotoxicity and er stress
 <cit> . however, since we did not observe any hepatocyte proliferation at the histological level, and given the measurement of proliferative cell nuclear antigen  , our results indicate that the pro-apoptotic branch of the mapk pathway predominated in bap-treated xenopus.

the hypothesis for this study is that ir-like symptoms will develop rapidly in xenopus exposed to bap, affecting the metabolism of carbohydrates and fatty acids and thus leading further to liver steatosis with an apoptotic phenotype in hepatocytes. cholesterol metabolism disruption is known to be associated with ir
 <cit> , and our temporal study shows that this occurs posterior to the ir symptoms. as it is the case in mammals
 <cit> , cholesterol metabolism in frogs is tightly regulated by estrogens. more specifically, estrogens induce an increase in hepatic cholesterol synthesis and uptake by activating hmgcoa reductase and ldlr gene transcription, allowing the lipidation of vitellogenin, which is involved in egg maturation
 <cit> . moreover, estrogen receptor signaling is affected by igf- <dig> in a feedback loop
 <cit>  and ahr regulation
 <cit> , the latter being involved in the disruption of estrogen-induced vitellogenin synthesis in chicken and fish
 <cit> . steatosis and lipid metabolism disruption has also been associated with other, inter-connected, endocrine axes
 <cit> . we thus hypothesized that the “outbreak of gene expression” observed at 12 hours post-exposure, associated with lipid and cholesterol metabolism, could also be explained by a disruption of the homeostatic mechanisms in other organs, and the result of a multi-signal integration leading to a perceptible subsequent impact on the liver transcriptome. for example, an increase in the transcription of the udpgt2a <dig> gene encoding an enzyme responsible for estrogen conjugation and elimination by the liver was observed
 <cit> , somewhat contradicting the observation of over-transcription of the lipase hormone sensitive gene encoding an esterase involved in the discharge of cholesterol for further use as a steroid precursor
 <cit> .

the underlying mechanisms remain unclear and warrant further investigation. the marked induction of the hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis pathway triggered by bap may ultimately interfere with the estrogen-regulated lipidation of vitellogenin. in the long term, such mechanisms may impair amphibian reproduction by disrupting estrogen-controlled egg maturation.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides initial insights into the hidden adverse effects of high environmental concentrations of bap on anurans, using x. tropicalis as a biological model. although decreased cholesterol in the bile and an increase in steatosis are known consequences of xenobiotic exposure, our kinetic approach and the use of mrna sequencing revealed for the first time the sequential toxic effect mechanisms induced by pahs. bap induced a marked metabolic disorder in the liver highlighted by an insulin resistance-like syndrome phenotype and hepatotoxicity due to impaired lipid metabolism . although the concentration used in this study is likely to occur in highly-polluted sites where frogs live and reproduce, a 24-hour exposure is more characteristic of acute contamination. additional studies concerning chronic exposure to commonly-occurring environmental concentrations of bap are needed to confirm the relevance of our results to in situ conditions. however, taken overall, our results strongly suggest that bap may disrupt carbohydrate and cholesterol metabolism, and more generally liver physiology as a whole, even after short-term exposure. in the long term, such mechanisms may impair amphibian physiology and reproduction by disrupting egg maturation and energy allocation for reproduction.figure  <dig>

hepatocyte responses to bap exposure at sub-lethal concentration. this model, based on our transcriptome and liver phenotype dynamic analyses, suggests that bap is responsible for the induction of an insulin-resistance-like phenotype in xenopus. insulin resistance is characterized by the over-transcription of gluconeogenic enzymes genes , sustained hyperglycemia, an over-transcription of glucose transporter  and severe liver steatosis. consequently, hyperinsulinemia may lead to the marked induction of cholesterol synthesis pathways and to a decrease in cholesterol export to the bile. the accumulation of lipids and cholesterol in the hepatocytes thus induces both er stress and lipid toxicity leading to apoptosis or necrosis. ldl, low density lipoprotein; ldlr, low density lipoprotein receptor; glut <dig>  glucose transporter 2; glc, glucose; chol, cholesterol; pepck, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1; hmgcoar, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa reductase; srebp-tf <dig>  sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 2; er, endoplasmic reticulum; ffa, free fatty acid, tg, triglycerides; insulin r, insulin resistance.
