BACKGROUND
the major histocompatibility complex  is a primary factor in initiating immune defenses, and it is composed of glycoproteins that are specialized to present foreign antigens to t lymphocytes  <cit> . the mhc multigene family can be divided into at least  <dig> main classes of genes: class i and class ii. class i molecules are expressed in a wide variety of nucleated cells and mainly respond to intracellular parasites  <cit> . mhc class i proteins are structurally composed of a cytoplasmic region, a transmembrane portion, and  <dig> extracellular domains , where antigen-binding domains  encoded by exons 2– <dig> interact to form the hypervariable peptide-binding region   <cit> .

apart from their prominent role in immune responses, much attention has been paid to mhc genes because of their extensive polymorphism. in recent years, the patterns of genetic variability in mhc class i genes have been intensively investigated across different vertebrate taxa, including mammals  <cit> , birds  <cit> , reptiles  <cit> , amphibians  <cit> , and fishes  <cit> . the mechanisms that generate abundant mhc variation primarily involve parasite-related balancing selection  <cit> , such as frequency-dependent selection or overdominant selection  <cit> . because fast-evolving pathogens can easily escape the immune surveillance of common host mhc alleles, frequency-dependent selection prevails, contributing to the generation and retention of rare alleles  <cit> . consequently, changes in the pathogen community over time and location lead to mhc variation in host populations  <cit> . in the case of overdominance, heterozygotes exhibiting superior recognition of a wider range of pathogens mount a stronger immune defense against pathogen infections than do homozygotes  <cit> . in addition, mhc-based mating preferences increase mhc gene heterogeneity in progeny .

in diverse vertebrate lineages, including birds, the mhc gene family has an extremely complex molecular architecture and genome organization with high gene copy numbers, abundant pseudogenes, frequent recombination, and homologous chromosome exchanges . the complex evolutionary pattern in mhc genes appears to be dictated both by birth-and-death and concerted evolution  <cit> . in the birth-and-death mechanism, some novel duplicated genes remain functional for long periods in the genome, whereas others decay into non-functional genes  or are completely eliminated from the genome  <cit> . the concerted evolution model implies that different members of the mhc family evolve as a unit, primarily due to recombination across paralogous genes  <cit> ; as a result, genes within a species are more similar compared to orthologous genes in closely related species. moreover, such widespread sequence homogeneity caused by repeated recombination events increases the difficulty in assigning alleles to specific mhc loci. therefore, given the current poor understanding of mhc genomic organization, mhc single-locus typing in some non-model avian taxa is more challenging . the chicken mhc-b , the first representative of the “minimal essential” mhc, is highly condensed and dramatically simpler than the mammalian mhc, containing only  <dig> classical class i genes, bf <dig> and bf <dig>  <cit> . the detailed knowledge of mhc organization in chickens and its compressed nature facilitated the characterization of mhc diversity at the locus-specific level  <cit> .

golden pheasants , representing an endangered species in china, are scattered in the central and western regions of mainland china  <cit> . their main distribution areas are divided by  <dig> major geographical barriers: the yangtze river and qinling-daba mountain  . to provide efficient protective strategies for this pheasant, we prioritized screening of mhc class i variation among wild populations. previous studies on the golden pheasant mhc have reported the complete sequence of the gold pheasant mhc-b region, which is nearly identical to the chicken mhc-b gene arrangement  <cit> . the 97-kb golden pheasant mhc-b comprises  <dig> streamlined genes and conforms to the minimal essential hypothesis. in addition, only  <dig> duplicated functional class i genes  were identified in this species, as in chickens  <cit> . based on these findings, we examined allelic variation of classical mhc class i genes in golden pheasants. the main objectives of this study were to  characterize sequence polymorphisms of exons  <dig> and  <dig> from both ia <dig> and ia <dig> genes through locus-specific pcr amplification,  examine the role of historical positive selection and recombination in shaping class i diversity, and  infer the population-genetics structure on the basis of mhc variation.fig.  <dig> geographic sampling locations of wild golden pheasants in china. the green zone represents the qinling-daba mountain , which spans across central and western china, while the blue curve indicates the yangtze river running from east to west china. red dots mark all wild populations sampled for our study, and the population abbreviations are as follows: lx, linxia; ts, tianshui; bj, baoji; cq, changqing; fp, foping; ns, ningshan; jg, jiange; qc, qingchuan; lc, lichuan; hn: hunan; qj: qianjiang; gz, guizhou. this figure was created based on the map of china 



RESULTS
mhc class i diversity
for the ia <dig> and ia <dig> genes, no more than  <dig> alleles were identified per pheasant by the pcr-based, single-stranded conformation polymorphism  technique, indicating that single-locus genotyping was optimal using the present primer sets. for ia <dig>   <dig> of  <dig>  and  <dig> of  <dig>  nucleotide sites were variable at exons  <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig> and  <dig> alleles were identified, respectively. for ia <dig>   <dig> of  <dig>  and  <dig> of  <dig>  nucleotide sites were variable, and  <dig> and  <dig> alleles were found at exons  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

our unpublished experimental data indicate that both ia genes are expressed in the golden pheasant. through screening cdna libraries using universal primers,  <dig> ia sequences were found for one pheasant; among them,  <dig> sequences corresponded to alleles from ia <dig> and the other  <dig> were from ia <dig>  moreover, none of the putative amino acid sequences showed frameshift mutations for either gene, further implying that both genes were functional. for ia <dig>   <dig> of  <dig>  and  <dig> of  <dig>  amino acid sites were variable at exons  <dig> and  <dig>  fourteen alleles at exon  <dig> and  <dig> alleles at exon  <dig> coded for  <dig> and  <dig> distinct amino acid sequences, respectively . remarkably, the ia <dig> alleles at exon  <dig>  shared a locus-specific amino acid motif constituted by  <dig> conserved, discontinuous residues . such a striking feature, which resembled that reported in domestic chicken bf <dig> alleles  <cit> , might be used to distinguish ia <dig> from ia <dig> fig.  <dig> golden pheasant ia  amino acid alignment. numbers above the alignment refer to residue positions. locus-specific residues belonging to the ia <dig> gene are indicated by open boxes. pbr sites predicted from consensus positions of chicken class i molecules  <cit>  are marked with a “+” symbol. the positively selected sites  for ia <dig> and ia <dig> are indicated above and below the alignments, respectively. a filled asterisk represents pss identified using the m <dig> site model, while a filled or open prism marks a pss detected by rel or fel, respectively. interlocus recombination events determined by the rdp program produced  <dig> daughter recombinants, with their respective recombined regions indicated by grey shading; ia2-e2* <dig> as the major parent is denoted with an open triangle and ia1-e2* <dig> as the minor parent is denoted with a filled triangle



for ia <dig>   <dig> of  <dig>  and  <dig> of  <dig>  amino acid sites were variable at exons  <dig> and  <dig>  twenty-seven and  <dig> different amino acid sequences were encoded by the exon  <dig> alleles  and exon  <dig> alleles , respectively . as mentioned above, the ia2-e <dig> alleles were the most variable and diverse and showed the greatest nucleotide and amino acid distances, especially in the pbr , whereas the ia1-e <dig> alleles were the least diverse, with both distance values in the pbr slightly less than in the non-pbr.table  <dig> nucleotide and amino acid distances of mhc i alleles for the golden pheasant

selection of  <dig> ia genes
calculations for non-synonymous  and synonymous  substitutions for ia <dig> and ia <dig> are shown in table  <dig>  regarding the putative pbr of ia1-e <dig>  dn was almost 4-fold higher than ds, although the difference between these  <dig> values was not statistically significant . non-pbr codons also yielded higher dn than ds values, but again the difference showed no significant deviation from neutrality . conversely, ia2-e <dig> alleles showed a significantly higher dn than ds in the pbr , while dn/ds was < <dig> for non-pbr codons. surprisingly, for the α <dig> domain  of both ia molecules, a lower dn than ds value was observed even in the pbr, although dn in the pbr was approximately 2-fold higher than in the non-pbr.table  <dig> calculations of non-synonymous  and synonymous  substitutions for golden pheasant mhc class i genes

based on the alignment of  <dig> codons within the ia <dig> gene, omegamap inferred  <dig> and  <dig> positively selected amino acid sites in exon  <dig> and exon  <dig>  respectively. fewer positively selected amino acids were found using other methods. both the random-effects likelihood and fixed-effects likelihood  models identified  <dig> codons under positive selection , while likelihood ratio tests, by comparison of m <dig> and m <dig> site models, detected  <dig> positively selected sites . almost all sites under positive selection, as estimated using paml software, were also detected using omegamap. based on the combined results of the  <dig> methods, we concluded that  <dig> positive selection sites may be directly associated with peptide binding. however, there were fewer codons in the ia <dig> gene under positive selection .table  <dig> inference of positively selected amino acid sites for golden pheasant mhc class i sequences

phylogenetic analysis
the golden pheasant mhc class i sequences clearly clustered with published mhc i sequences from other galliformes species, but they were separated from those of non-galliformes birds both in the nucleic acid  and amino acid  phylogenetic trees. within the galliformes clade, sequences belonging to the same species tended to group together. in fig. 3a and b, all ia1-e <dig> alleles and  <dig> ia2-e <dig> alleles of the golden pheasants formed an independent clade, while all ia2-e <dig> alleles fell into  <dig> relatively well-distinguished clusters due to extreme sequence variability. similarly, those e <dig> alleles, which displayed great sequence divergences characteristic of the classical class i genes, mostly fell into  <dig> major clusters except for ia1-e3* <dig> and ia1-e3* <dig> ; within one cluster, alleles from both loci comingled with each other. in addition, the network relationship among class i sequences of  <dig> galliformes species also signified the absence of orthologous relationships .fig.  <dig> bayesian trees of ia
1-e <dig> nucleic  and amino  acids, ia2-e <dig> nucleic  and amino  acids, and the recombination between exons  <dig> and  <dig> in ia <dig>  and ia <dig> . the nj tree was not shown, but was similar to the bayesian trees. the sequences used to generate the trees are as follows: gallus gallus: gaga-bf1* <dig> , gaga-bf1* <dig> , gaga-bf1* <dig> , gaga-bf1* <dig> , gaga-bf1* <dig>  gaga-bf2* <dig> , gaga-bf2* <dig> , gaga-bf2* <dig> , gaga-bf2* <dig> , gaga-bf2* <dig> ; meleagris gallopavo: mega-ia1* <dig> , mega-ia1* <dig> , mega-ia1* <dig> , mega-ia1* <dig> , mega-ia1* <dig> , mega-ia2* <dig> , mega-ia2* <dig> , mega-ia2* <dig> , mega-ia2* <dig> ; coturnix japonica: coja-b <dig> , coja-b <dig> , coja-c , coja-d <dig> , coja-d <dig> , coja-e ; tetrao tetrix: tete-bf <dig> , tete-bf <dig> ; tympanuchus cupido: tycu-ia-e3*01-* <dig> , tycu-ia ; numida meleagris: nume-bf2* <dig> , nume-bf2* <dig> ; acrocephalus arundinaceus: acar-mhc-i ; larus scopulinus: lasc-uaa , lasc-uba , lasc-uca , lasc-uda ; calidris canutus: caca-ua ; anas platyrhynchos: anpl-uaa , anpl-uba ; anser anser: anan-mhc-i . sphenodon punctatus sequence: sppu-u  was used to root the tree



recombination of mhc i loci in the golden pheasant
the alignment results between ia <dig> and ia <dig> revealed that the intermediate 44– <dig> amino acid residues of alleles ia2-e2* <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  11– <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were nearly equivalent to the corresponding region of alleles ia1-e2* <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  09– <dig>  and  <dig> , which was suggestive of intergenic recombination. this pattern was subsequently verified using at least  <dig> methods in the rdp software program. those interlocus recombination events occurred intensively between ia2-e2* <dig> as the major parent  and ia1-e2* <dig> as the minor parent . they ultimately produced  <dig> daughter recombinants , accounting for a substantial proportion  of the ia2-e <dig> alleles. thus, a genomic region  of ia2-e2* <dig> was replaced respectively by its counterpart in ia1-e2* <dig> during the recombination process. accordingly, one significant breakpoint at 109 nt  was detected using the gard program. we also assessed recombination between exons  <dig> and  <dig> in ia <dig>  and ia <dig> , respectively. the bars  with fore-grey and after-white were the products of recombination between exon  <dig>  and exon  <dig> , and vice versa for the fore-white after-grey bars. among these bars, those with a frequency higher than  <dig>  should reflect inter-exon recombination hotspots.

genetic diversity and population-structure analysis of mhc i loci across golden pheasant populations
within the populations studied, the number of ia <dig> alleles ranged from 5– <dig> at exon  <dig> and from 3– <dig> at exon  <dig>  whereas the number of ia <dig> alleles ranged between  <dig> and  <dig> at either exon  <dig> or exon  <dig> . to handle the variation of sample sizes across the different populations, allelic richness was standardized based on a minimal sample size of  <dig> diploid individuals, using the rarefaction method. in this case, estimates of the allelic richness at each locus still differed among the populations . five ia <dig> alleles  and  <dig> ia <dig> alleles  were observed throughout all the populations studied. in particular,  <dig> alleles  were most common, although the allele frequencies varied among populations . for ia <dig>  most populations exhibited less heterozygosity than expected, and all instances conformed to the hardy–weinberg equilibrium  after bonferroni correction . for ia <dig>  a similar pattern was observed except for  <dig> cases with significant heterozygote deficits . we inferred that the presence of null alleles may not be the main cause of hwe departures in these  <dig> cases because their frequencies were all < <dig> , as estimated by the expectation-maximization algorithm.

the genetic clustering analysis, computed with a non-linkage model in structure, revealed that Δk reached a peak at k =  <dig>  = − <dig> ; additional file 4: figure s2), indicating that the split in the dataset divided the populations into  <dig> major genetic clusters. the blue cluster  is dominantly composed of populations scattered across the northern region of the yangtze river , except for baoji . the yellow cluster mainly represents populations located in the southern region of the yangtze river . based on clustering results,  <dig> populations were separated into  <dig> groups for subsequent analysis: nyr  and syr . bj appeared slightly distant from the other nyr populations, probably because of the lack of representative samples. we also performed analysis with a linkage model in structure software. the same Δk and grouping were obtained, but the relative proportion of each population in either cluster was different. the association between the syr and nyr groups was clearly demonstrated in both non-linkage and linkage models.fig.  <dig> structure clustering results obtained for k =  <dig>  each individual sample is represented by a thin vertical bar, and the length of each bar corresponds to the posterior probability within each cluster. populations are separated by black bars, with the names indicated below the graph and the specific geographic locations marked above the graph. nyr, the northern region of the yangtze river; syr, the southern region of the yangtze river; nqdm, northern areas of qinling-daba mountain; sqdm, southern areas of qinling-daba mountain. lx, linxia; ts, tianshui; bj, baoji; cq, changqing; fn, foping-ningshan; jq, jiange-qingchuan; lc, lichuan; hn: hunan; qj: qianjiang; gz, guizhou. k, the number of putative clusters



a congruent pattern from structure analysis was also obtained when genetic differentiation among populations over the mhc class i loci was estimated by fst . after omitting the bj population, pairwise fst values exhibited no significant differentiation within the nyr or syr populations , whereas pairwise fst statistics showed significant differentiation between nyr and syr populations , suggesting that all populations, except bj, tended to form  <dig> major groups  that were divided by the yangtze river. a mantel test showed that the observed correlation between pairwise fst values and geographical distances was significantly different from zero , indicating that a strong isolation-by-distance relationship occurred for mhc class i variations.

during analysis of molecular variance , we examined the genetic structure pattern of the  <dig> groups, after completely excluding bj. the 2-group analysis indicated that  <dig>  % of the genetic variation was distributed within populations,  <dig>  % of the total variance was partitioned between groups, and  <dig>  % occurred among populations within groups . the results demonstrated that the genetic variation between groups  was significantly greater than the genetic variation among populations  , suggesting that the yangtze river might serve as a barrier impeding gene flow between the nyr and syr populations.table  <dig> summary of amova results for mhc class i loci from golden pheasant populations

discussion
extensive allelic variation in mhc class i genes
we characterized, for the first time, the second and third exons of mhc class i genes in  <dig> wild populations of golden pheasant. we identified alleles for the ia <dig> locus  and for the ia <dig> locus , which differed markedly in their levels of allelic divergence. ia <dig> displayed more extensive sequence variations, perhaps because of differential selection pressure or as a reflection of its inherently different properties. forty-one different alleles in the second exon and  <dig> different alleles in the third exon were found among  <dig> individuals, revealing a high polymorphism of  <dig> peptide-binding domains in the golden pheasant class i genes. in previous studies, other non-model avian species also exhibited extraordinary diversity at exon  <dig> of mhc class i genes. for example,  <dig> mhc class i alleles were identified in a screening of  <dig> red knots  <cit> ,  <dig> unique functional class i variants were detected in a natural population of blue tits  <cit> , and up to  <dig> divergent class i gene sequences were observed in the scarlet rosefinch population  <cit> . however, class i sequences from these avian species were generally amplified using species- or motif-specific pcr, which does not involve assignment to particular loci. hence, for these studies, it was not possible to explore the evolutionary processes underlying mhc variation at each locus.

differential mhc polymorphism driven by differential selection pressure
the main force generating and maintaining mhc polymorphism appears to be balancing selection  <cit> . nucleotide sites under positive selection are expected to accumulate more non-synonymous than synonymous substitutions, eventually bringing about amino acid changes and corresponding functional changes in mhc proteins  <cit> . such adaptive evolutionary processes due to parasite-driven selection should be evident at the pbr  <cit> . according to the proposed criteria, both ia loci of the golden pheasant showed evidence of positive selection for diversification. for ia2-e <dig>  positive selection acted only on pbr codons, which showed a significantly increased degree of non-synonymous substitutions . ia1-e <dig> alleles also evolved under positive selection, although not significantly. e <dig> alleles of both ia genes exhibited higher dn/ds ratios at pbr codons than at non-pbr codons, which agrees with the hallmark of such functionally important regions as targets of balancing selection  <cit> . however, compared with ia <dig>  the ia <dig> gene showed more allele polymorphisms and more frequent nucleotide substitutions, implying that increased selection pressure more effectively increased the functional variation at ia <dig>  though no significant recombination events were detected in e <dig> sequences, interlocus homogenization implied that these  <dig> loci might have evolved by concerted evolution. previous findings have confirmed that different patterns of allele polymorphisms occurring at mhc genes are subject to the divergence of selection intensities between loci. in humans, the intensity of selection appears to have differed among  <dig> hla class i loci; hla-b, which was affected by the strongest selection, is more polymorphic than the other  <dig> class i loci, hla-a and hla-c  <cit> . in the alpine newt, increased variation in the dab gene, composed of  <dig> alleles, was largely caused by strong selection over an evolutionary timescale, while low variation in the dbb gene, containing only  <dig> alleles, was correlated with a lack of selection pressure  <cit> . in contrast, the lack of increased dn over ds in the pbr of e <dig> alleles indicates that positive selection might be less advantageous in the α <dig> domain. stronger selection in the α <dig> domains than in the α <dig> domains could be ascribed to structural principles, which crucially govern the important peptide-binding motifs of class i molecules  <cit> . in addition, without exact knowledge of the crystal structures of class i molecules, the putative golden pheasant pbr deduced from consensus sites of chicken  <cit> , might vary considerably from the actual pbr of golden pheasant class i proteins, especially for the α <dig> domains. however, dn in the pbr at exon  <dig>  which was twice that determined for the non-pbr, suggests that selection might also have played a role in maintaining their variation.

based on the predictive outcomes of  <dig> codon-based models, we found substantial evidence of balancing selection at individual codons, as well as divergent selective pressure between ia <dig> and ia <dig>  seven positively selected sites were identified in ia <dig> by at least  <dig> codon-based models , and all of them corresponded to peptide-recognition sites in chickens  <cit> . a considerable amount of non-synonymous variation occurred at those specific codons under positive selection , demonstrating that polymorphisms within the α <dig> and α <dig> domains may be of functional importance  <cit> . conversely, fewer positively selected sites were detected in ia <dig>  therefore, selective pressure on both ia loci differed strikingly, and ia <dig> underwent much stronger positive selection, especially in the pbr. in conclusion, differing levels of diversity and differential selection might be indicative of different functional roles for the golden pheasant ia loci.

phylogeny and interlocus recombination
the pattern of mhc evolution in birds appears to be quite different from that described in mammals . mammalian mhc genes independently evolved, as reflected by phylogenetic trees showing that corresponding orthologous sequences from different species grouped more closely than other sequences from the same species  <cit> . in birds, the lack of orthologous relationships among putatively different mhc loci is common, and such examples of phylogeny-based orthology in mhc genes are limited to pairs of closely related avian species . however, the phylogenetic inconsistency in avian species is mainly due to higher frequencies of interlocus recombination, also termed “concerted evolution” . frequent recombination events occurring in mhc multigene families usually produce between-locus homogenization, which obscures the true phylogenetic relationship. similar to some cases observed in class ii genes in galliformes  <cit> , golden pheasant class i sequences failed to constitute well-supported independent groups in accordance with each gene. instead, class i sequences appeared to group together and were intermixed , which is consistent with concerted changes. thus, the occurrence of intergenic recombination between ia <dig> and ia <dig> was discernibly responsible for the locus-intermingling pattern, underpinning the diversification of mhc genes in the golden pheasant.

population structure based on mhc class i variation
the ia <dig> and ia <dig> genes both exhibited a large variation in allele numbers across sampled populations, i.e., 6– <dig> alleles were found at ia2-e <dig> in each population , as well as in terms of sample size-corrected allelic richness. alternatively, a large difference in the number of alleles with a frequency of ≤ <dig>  was found among populations, i.e., 0– <dig> at ia2-e <dig> and 5– <dig> at ia3-e <dig> , indicating that rare alleles have been retained in the golden pheasant populations by frequency-dependent selection  <cit> , a potential mechanism accounting for the extreme polymorphism and long-term persistence of alleles at the mhc. furthermore, the widespread sharing of class i alleles  across all populations suggests that these alleles may have predominated in golden pheasant populations in recent times. if the same dominant pathogen widely invades different golden pheasant populations, a class i allele that confers a selective advantage in resistance against this prevalent pathogen is quite likely to be shared among populations.

the comparison of genetic differentiation between populations at various spatial scales also supports the hypothesis of balancing selection, which is generally regarded as the main force shaping mhc genetic diversity  <cit> . in a relatively small geographic region, where populations experience very similar pathogen-mediated selective regimes, i.e., homogenous selection pressure, balancing selection tends to decrease the levels of between-population variation compared to within-population variation  <cit> . therefore, the little differentiation among golden pheasant populations from the nyr or syr might be a result of homogenous balancing selection. however, the structuring of genetic variation at mhc loci indicated that the yangtze river itself shaped the population structure of golden pheasants. the yangtze river, as the largest river in china, is too wide for golden pheasants to cross because they do not participate in long-distance migratory flight. hence, the yangtze river, an important natural barrier to dispersal and gene flow for golden pheasant populations, intensified the genetic divergence and eventually caused the formation of  <dig> distinctive population groups: nyr and syr. significant inter-population differentiation between the nyr and syr clusters probably also resulted from geographic heterogeneity of balancing selection between distant populations, which reportedly occurs because of variation in pathogen communities at a broad geographic scale .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we genotyped mhc class i genes from  <dig> wild golden pheasant populations by pcr-sscp, using locus-specific primers. our work revealed that: 1)  <dig> mhc class i genes exhibited differential genetic polymorphisms, and much stronger positive selection detected at ia <dig> than at ia <dig> might account for the more extensive variation of ia2; 2) interlocus recombination between  <dig> ia genes, noticeably reflected by the intermingling phylogenetic pattern, is also an important mechanism responsible for the extensive allelic variation of the ia <dig> gene; 3) the pattern of population differentiation implied that homogenous balancing selection might explain why an even distribution of mhc variation was maintained among populations within the nyr or syr region, while the yangtze river acted as a barrier to gene flow between nyr and syr populations, and heterogeneous balancing selection might be an important factor determining the nyr-syr genetic structure in golden pheasants.
