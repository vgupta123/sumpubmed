BACKGROUND
ever since the theory of genetic incompatibility  was independently proposed by three eminent evolutionary biologists , researchers across the disciplines have been devoted to characterizing the evolutionary impacts of reproduction-associated genes on speciation and species diversity. understanding the molecular diversity of speciation genes would unravel the underlying mechanisms by which species diversity drives speciation and the latitudinal gradient of taxonomic groups as species diversity decreases with latitude  <cit> . further, in-depth understanding of the genetic and evolutionary mechanisms of speciation genes would not only provide important insights into an organism’s fitness and/or reproduction but also promote conservation of threatened mammalian species through genetic re-engineering, a technique that has recently been used to reverse hybrid sterility in mice by editing the zinc fingers  of a widely known speciation gene, prdm <dig>  <cit> . this landmark experiment further signified the important role of prdm <dig> in fertility and reproductive compatibility  <cit> . nevertheless, the reports of genome-wide non-random distributions of dna binding motifs and the corresponding clustering of meiotic recombination hotspots, together with the red queen model of evolution of these dna-binding motifs provide convincing evidence of the dominant role of prdm <dig> in metazoan speciation . red queen hypothesis, which is based on the metaphors in lewis carroll’s “through the looking glass”  <cit> , was first used by vanvalen  <cit>  to explain speciation dynamics and extinction of species. since then this metaphor has been widely used as the key hypothesis to test the continual adaptation of species in order to survive in the face of competition and changing environment, including the evolution of zfs of prdm <dig> by treating prdm <dig> zfs as “species” and genome background as “environment”  <cit> . nevertheless, the absence of functional prdm <dig> in canids  and presence of single copies of prdm <dig> in rodents but multiple copies  in primates, ruminants and other metazoan lineages  indicate an interesting yet complex evolutionary history of the prdm <dig> gene family.

prdm <dig> has been reported to play a dominant role in meiotic recombination in a wide range of mammalian groups . it is a member of the prdm gene family  <cit>  and encodes a protein with a krab, a ssxrd, a pr/set histone h <dig> trimethyl transferase domain and a dna-binding domain consisting of a variable-sized tandemly repeated array of c2h <dig> zfs at the c-terminal  <cit> . the c-terminal array of the c2h <dig> zfs domain possesses a dna-binding function, shows a high diversity and fast evolutionary rate, and hence is likely to have evolved extremely rapidly by positive darwinian selection . however, the n-terminal krab, ssxrd and set domains have evolved at a very slow rate  <cit> , thus making it an ideal genetic marker to trace the evolutionary history of prdm <dig> in each metazoan lineage.

despite the critical role of the prdm gene family in early development and reproduction  <cit>  little is known about the evolutionary history of these genes. two recent studies  <cit>  reported the evolution of prdm gene family and suggested that while primate prdm <dig> has a higher similarity of gene structure and protein domain organization with the non-primate co-orthologs and likely retains the features of the ancestral locus, prdm <dig> appears to be primate-specific and may have undergone major structural arrangements that decreased the number of zfs  <cit> . vervoort et al.  <cit>  reported that prdm <dig> and prdm <dig> gene trees do not form separate monophyletic groups and these gene trees are highly incongruent with the species tree, suggesting an unusual evolution of these genes in primates. further, those studies concluded that prdm7/ <dig> phylogenetic analysis may be unreliable for positioning the duplication events that have occurred in the primate lineage  <cit> . given such unusual evolutionary patterns of prdm7/ <dig>  in particular a non-monophyletic grouping of prdm <dig> and prdm <dig> in primates  <cit> , one might speculate that prdm <dig> and prdm <dig> have evolved independently in different metazoan lineages. therefore, it is unclear if these form monophyletic groups in other metazoan, and we might need to revise the nomenclature of these gene copies.

utilizing the n-terminal portion of the prdm <dig> nucleotide and protein sequences the objective of this study is to investigate the origin and evolution of the multiple copies of prdm <dig> in ruminants, to determine the phylogenetic congruencies of gene trees from these novel gene copies with the ruminant species tree, and to assess the underlying genetic and evolutionary forces that shaped the evolution of these gene copies in ruminants. furthermore, given the fact that each functional domain of the prdm <dig> gene is associated with different functions  <cit> , these functional domains are expected to show different evolutionary trajectories. thus, another objective of this study is to unravel the different evolutionary forces that shape the evolution of n-terminal and that are responsible for a variable-sized tandem-repeat array of c2h <dig> zfs at the c-terminal in each lineage. finally, we propose a model that explains the evolution of prdm <dig> and its multiple copies in the ruminant species.

RESULTS
we first give an overview of the main results and then provide more detailed explorations in the following paragraphs. the present study reports  evidence of ruminant-specific multiple gene duplication events which likely have had occurred before the ruminant speciation events and after the ancestral ruminant population diverged from its most recent common ancestor ,  the presence of three copies of prdm <dig> , two copies  in chromosome x  and one copy  in chromosome  <dig>  with variable-sized tandemly repeated arrays of c2h <dig> zfs at the c-terminal  thus indicating the possibility of ancient inter- and intra-chromosomal unequal crossing over and gene conversion events,  while lineages i and ii are characterized by the presence of variable tandemly repeated c2h <dig> zfs arrays, lineage iii lost these arrays ,  c2h <dig> zfs of lineages i and ii, particularly amino acid residues located at positions − <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> have likely evolved under strong positive selection  thus supporting the notion of previously established red queen hypothesis  <cit> , and finally,  together with the evidence of positive selection  relatively higher diversities at the nonsynonymous sites  the presence of identical arrays yet located at different alignment positions in the sister-species  as well as the observation of variable length of binding motifs for each ruminant species  support both the concerted evolution  <cit>  and a cyclical back-and-forth evolution of c2h <dig> zfs arrays throughout the ruminant evolution spanning millions of years regardless of positive frequency-dependent or negative frequency-dependent selection, a dynamic evolutionary pattern that was recently proposed for host-parasite co-evolution  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic trees inferred from prdm genes. a phylogenetic tree inferred from the set domain amino acid sequences  of the prdm genes. b prdm7/ <dig> gene tree inferred from the set domain . c phylogenetic tree inferred from the n-terminal portion of the amino acid sequences  of prdm <dig> depicting duplication and speciation events in ruminants. bootstrap values greater than  <dig> are shown at the base of the nodes. genbank accession numbers and scientific names of the species are shown. set domain sequences representing all the  <dig> prdm genes that were previously reported by fumasoni et al.  <cit>  were used as reference sequences. asterisks  indicate reference sequences for human prdm <dig>  <cit>  and human prdm <dig>  <cit> . hs: homo sapiens; pt: pan troglodytes

to evaluate the phylogenetic positioning  and clustering  of prdm <dig> and prdm <dig> in the prdm7/ <dig> gene tree and to assess the evolutionary origin of multiple copies of prdm <dig> in ruminants  we reconstructed the phylogenetic trees using the amino acid sequences of the pr domains located at the n-terminal region . consistent with previous studies  <cit> , our analyses revealed that prdm7/ <dig> form unique clusters  and that prdm <dig> is primate-specific . the n-terminal amino acid sequence-based phylogeny showed that each prdm <dig> copy  of ruminants formed a separate monophyletic group and showed the evidence of two gene duplication events prior to the ruminant speciation . multiple paralog copies of prdm <dig> in ruminants  support gene duplications before the speciation events. based on the previous reports , these three species  had a shared ancestry. bos diverged from the common ancestral population approximately  <dig>   million years ago , and the split between capra and ovis was estimated to be approximately  <dig>   mya. concurrently, the presence of all three prdm <dig> copies in each species provides strong evidence of the gene duplication events before ruminant speciation  .

one of the striking observations is the presence of two copies of prdm <dig>  on chrx . while one x-linked copy is characterized by the presence of variable-sized tandemly repeated c2h <dig> zfs  the other copy completely lost its zfs . interestingly, the dn/ds ratio , for the branch leading to x-linked lineages  was estimated to be  <dig> , indicating the evidence of positive selection, a typical characteristic of novel gene copies after a duplication event  <cit> . we also found that the c-terminal c2h <dig> zfs of lineages i and ii and the outgroup, especially the amino acid residues at the positions − <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that played crucial roles in dna binding during meiotic recombination  <cit> , have likely evolved under strong positive selection . the tandemly repeated arrangement of the zfs and the presence of identical zfs  showed evidence of concerted evolution of c2h <dig> zfs of both x-linked  and autosomal  prdm <dig> copies . further, we observed species-specific, lineage-specific, and individual-level variations of the length of tandemly repeated c2h <dig> zfs as well as variations in the predicted binding motifs . finally, taking all the possible evolutionary forces  that likely affected the evolution of prdm <dig> and maintained genetic variations even at the individual levels in these economically important ruminant species  into consideration, we presented a schematic model to describe how the multiple copies of prdm <dig> are derived and evolved in the ruminant species .fig.  <dig> proposed model of prdm <dig> evolution in ruminants. the proposed model is based on the evidence of gene duplication, inter-species and within species gene conversion, speciation and divergence time, as well as the evidence of variable selection pressures at the n- and c-terminal regions of the prdm9




discussion
despite the fact that prdm <dig> is a key regulator of meiotic recombination  and plays a dominant role in hybrid incompatibility  <cit> , little is known about the underlying genetic and evolutionary mechanisms that generated multiple copies of prdm <dig> in many metazoan lineages. the present study elucidates the underlying evolutionary genetic mechanisms that shaped the evolution of prdm <dig>  an important speciation gene  <cit> , in the economically important ruminants species . these domesticated ruminants are estimated to have diverged from a common ancestor approximately  <dig>   mya . in contrast to primate’s prdm <dig> and prdm <dig> gene copies that form non-separate monophyletic groups and show ambiguities concerning the phylogenetic positioning of the gene duplication events in the primate phylogeny  <cit> , the observation of deep-split among the three lineages together with a strong statistical support for monophyletic groups provide convincing evidence of two gene duplication events before the ruminant speciation. taken together with the results of a previous study  <cit> , our study suggests that the prdm <dig> duplication event in ruminants, which is estimated to have had occurred sometime between  <dig> and  <dig> mya, is ruminant-specific and likely occurred after the split of the ruminants ancestral populations from the most recent common ancestor. nevertheless, based on these results, one might speculate that prdm <dig> of other mammalian lineages may also exhibit unique phylogenetic histories. further, together with the results of a previous study  <cit> , we ascertained that the primate-specific prdm <dig>  <cit>  is not phylogenetically closely related with the novel copies of ruminant prdm <dig>  therefore, warrants separate nomenclature of prdm <dig> copies belonging to lineage ii and iii.

although gene duplication events through inter-chromosomal especially, autosomal crossing-overs are common across the mammalian groups  <cit> , the observations of gene duplications between sex chromosomes and autosomes is a unique event. interestingly, a previous study has also reported inter-chromosomal duplications of the adrenoleukodystrophy  locus from chrx to chromosomes 2p <dig>  10p <dig>  16p <dig> and 22q <dig> in humans  <cit> . however, to our knowledge, so far no such inter-chromosomal duplications between chrx and autosomes have been reported for any other mammalian taxa. we previously found a strong association between prdm <dig> on chr <dig> and recombination phenotypes in cattle  <cit> . sandor et al.  <cit>  have also reported the presence of an x-linked prdm <dig> and have detected several polymorphisms in the corresponding c2h <dig> zfs. although prdm <dig> is present on both chr <dig> and chrx in cattle, the genetic and evolutionary mechanisms of the evolution of prdm <dig> on the two chromosomes remain unclear. the presence of x-linked prdm <dig> copies in ruminants could possibly be a rare event and be explained by some unique evolutionary mechanisms. sex chromosomes were derived from a pair of ancestral autosomes  <cit>  and have evolved independently many times during the mammalian evolution  <cit> . additionally, ohta  <cit>  proposed that inter-and intra-chromosomal unequal crossing overs, coupled with mutation and random drift, are among the fundamental forces in the evolution of multigene families. more importantly, inter-and intra-chromosomal unequal crossing overs have been shown to have a dominant effect on the contraction and expansion of genes in a given family  <cit> . therefore, it could be possible that the ancestral locus of prdm <dig>  which is originally located at the autosomal region in most of the metazoans, appeared in the ruminant’s chrx through unequal crossing overs, which might have happened millions of years ago possibly prior to ruminant's speciation and resulted in two additional copies of x-linked prdm <dig>  given the fact that ruminants prdm <dig> copies have been in the autosome and in the x chromosome for at least the past  <dig> million years, these copies are predicted to have differential evolutionary trajectories  <cit> . mammalian sex chromosome genes are predicted to evolve at a much higher rate, and the fixation rate of beneficial mutations is predicted to be higher for x-linked genes than that of autosomal genes  <cit> . interestingly, the observed elevated dn/ds ratio , which indicates the evidence of positive selection, further supports the notion of accelerated rate of evolution of novel gene copies after a duplication event  <cit> . additionally, these duplicated copies may also have some functional consequences, and three possibilities would be expected  <cit> : i) the novel copies are likely to have experienced relaxed selection pressure and ultimately may acquire deleterious mutations that lead to loss of function, a process known as non-functionalization; ii) in rare cases the novel copies can acquire beneficial mutations that differentiate their functions from that of the ancestor, a process known as neo-functionalization; and iii) mutations may occur in both ancestor and duplicated copies of a gene and result in complementary functions which is known as sub-functionalization  <cit> . the presence of a stop-codon at the krab region in three sequences representing the genus ovis and capra of the lineage iii  supports the notion of non-functionalization; however an artifact of sequencing errors cannot be ruled out.

although it is apparent that prdm <dig> of chr <dig> regulates meiotic recombination in cattle  <cit>  the functional significance of the x-linked prdm <dig> is yet to be explored. nevertheless, even in the absence of gene duplication event, sex chromosome genes are predicted to evolve at a faster rate than autosomal genes  <cit> . therefore, the mutation rate of the x-linked prdm <dig> is expected to be higher than that of the autosomal copy. however, due to the limited sample size, we could not directly estimate the mutation rate for each lineage, but the observation of incomplete lineage sorting for bos species in chr <dig> may be an indication of slower mutation rate of lineage i. this inference, however, should be taken with caution since sequences representing more species are required to test the hypothesis of mutational differences between the x-linked and autosomal prdm <dig> copies.

in contrast to the n-terminal portion of prdm <dig> which comprises three conserved functional domains  <cit> , the c-terminal c2h <dig> zfs of lineages i and ii and the outgroup, especially the amino acid residues at the positions − <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that played crucial roles in dna binding during meiotic recombination  <cit> , have likely evolved under strong positive selection. although this observation of extremely rapid evolution of ruminant’s prdm <dig> c2h <dig> zfs by positive darwinian selection is nothing surprising and has been reported for several other mammalian species  <cit> , the evidence of positive selection on the x-linked c2h <dig> zfs is one of the most striking observations. this compelling evidence of positive selection on the x-linked c2h <dig> zfs prdm <dig> indicates some unknown functional significance, thus warrants further investigation on the functional significance of the x-linked prdm <dig> c2h <dig> zfs. consistent with a previous study  <cit> , the present study has also showed evidence of concerted evolution of both x-linked  and autosomal  zfs of prdm <dig>  which explained the species-specific, even at the individual level, variations in the length of the tandemly repeated c2h <dig> zfs and the predicted binding motifs as well.

CONCLUSIONS
in stark contrast to the primate lineage where the prdm <dig> duplication mechanism is still an unresolved issue  <cit>  our study provides strong evidence that the autosomal prdm <dig> of ruminants has been duplicated to the x chromosome in the ruminants, which likely happened before the ruminant speciation events. the presence of x-linked prdm <dig> copies in ruminants could possibly be a rare event and may be explained by some unique evolutionary mechanisms, possibly, through unequal crossing-overs. nevertheless, the inter-chromosomal duplications before the ruminant’s speciation together with the persistent positive selection and concerted evolution of zfs, at both species and individual levels, shaped the evolution of autosomal and x-linked prdm <dig> in ruminants. collectively, this study reports the unique evolutionary mechanism of prdm <dig> in ruminants, including the presence of duplicated copies of prdm <dig> on chr <dig> and chrx both with active c2h <dig> zfs under positive selection. concomitantly, a recent study has also reported extensive diversity of prdm <dig> in several ruminant species  <cit> . nevertheless, given such lineage-based unique evolutionary trajectories of the prdm <dig>  as demonstrated in the present study as well as in previous studies , taking more taxonomic lineages into consideration, future studies should be carried out to unravel the evolutionary trajectory of this important speciation gene across the metazoans.
