BACKGROUND
liver diseases occur frequently in the canine pet population. around 12% of the dogs in first opinion practices have liver disease  <cit>  and account for 1-2% of a university veterinary clinical population  <cit> . it is conceivable that these numbers, based on the cambridge region  and the utrecht university clinics , respectively, are exemplary for the west-european dog pet population. one third of chronic hepatitis cases are caused by copper accumulation. in addition, microorganisms, toxins and drugs have been reported to cause hepatitis in dogs. in more than 60% of cases, however, hepatitis remains idiopathic  <cit> . the recently discovered canine hepacivirus is unlikely to cause canine hepatitis  <cit> .

irrespective of the cause of hepatocyte damage, the liver can recover from such insults due to replication of fully differentiated hepatocytes  <cit> . in case this replication is exhausted or otherwise hampered, hepatic progenitor cells  are reported to have the potential to take over regeneration. these stem cells are believed to be bi-potential and to have the capacity to differentiate into either hepatocytes or cholangiocytes, depending on cellular demand  <cit> . hpcs are located in the terminal branches of the biliary tree, called the canal of hering  <cit> . several publications describe the cellular and molecular constituents of the canine or feline hpc niche  <cit> . the niche is not just an anatomical region in the liver, but it has a biological function as it provides the cell- and matrix derived signals to instruct the hpc’s cellular fate.

in order to safely use hpcs for liver regeneration in a clinical setting where hepatocyte replication is insufficient, detailed knowledge of crucial signalling cascades for hpc activation is essential. two signalling pathways, wnt/β-catenin and notch, are involved in proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells including hpcs in other mammals  <cit> . this prompted the present focus on these two transmembrane signalling pathways in the activation of hpcs in canine liver diseases. since lobular dissecting hepatitis  was previously observed to contain the highest number of activated hpcs, the activated hpc niche from ldh was microdissected and molecular analyses were performed in comparison with quiescent hpc niches harboured adjacent to portal areas of normal canine liver  <cit> .

these data show that both wnt/β-catenin and notch signalling are enhanced in activated hpc niches in dogs with ldh. the previous descriptions of the cellular constituents of the canine hpc niche and the current investigation on specific signalling cascades clearly show the similarities with other mammals, including human  <cit> . it is therefore conceivable that results of clinical approaches in human medicine will be applicable and beneficial in veterinary health care.

RESULTS
gene-expression profiling of laser microdissected hpc niches indicate activation of wnt and notch pathways
representative pictures of laser microdissected hpc niches in normal liver and lobular dissecting hepatitis  stained with keratin <dig>  are depicted in figure 1a. expression levels of the wnt receptor fzd <dig> and the wnt-induced transcription factor tcf <dig> were significantly higher in ldh cases compared to normal controls, as measured in lmd samples . of the various notch-receptor proteins, only notch <dig> and notch <dig> expression levels were significantly higher in diseased material . in line is the observation that only ligand jag <dig> is upregulated, whereas jag <dig> is not . based on these expression levels of ligand and receptors, it was anticipated that an activated wnt/β-catenin and notch signalling cascade would be present in activated hpc niches . importantly, the expression levels of classical target genes for wnt/β-catenin, axin <dig>  and notch signalling, hey <dig>  were indeed elevated in ldh, confirming active downstream signalling .figure  <dig>

immunofluorescence confirm activated wnt/β-catenin and notch signalling in hpc during disease
to specify the cellular origin of the upregulated gene expression levels, double immunofluorescence for β-catenin/k <dig>  and notch1/notch intra cellular domain /k <dig> was performed . this revealed that β-catenin and notch1/nicd were strongly expressed in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of the cells of the ductular reaction in ldh. expression of β-catenin in hepatocytes and cholangiocytes was membranous, indicative for a low activation status of the wnt/β-catenin signalling cascade. similarly, notch1/nicd was expressed in canalicular- and less pronounced in basolateral membranes in hepatocytes in normal tissues.figure  <dig>

wnt/β-catenin and notch signalling coincide with hpc proliferation and mesenchymal characteristics but are lost with differentiation
to investigate the functional involvement of wnt and notch in hpc activation, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent stainings were performed . with ki <dig> staining the proliferative activity in the tissues was assessed. in ldh, very few hepatocytes were found to be positive for ki <dig>  while a substantial number of ki <dig> positive cells were found in the dr . to evaluate the potential of hpcs to obtain mesenchymal characteristics, immunohistochemical staining for vimentin and double immunofluorescent staining for vimentin and panck was performed . this revealed strong staining of vimentin in ductular structures, clearly showing expression of a mesenchymal marker on hpcs. to investigate the role of wnt and notch in hpc differentiation during liver disease, the mature hepatocyte marker heppar <dig> in combination with β-catenin or notch1/nicd in a double immunofluorescent staining was used. a clear polarisation of the ductular reaction was observed in such a way that the non-differentiated cells exhibited strong cytoplasmic and sometimes nuclear staining for both β-catenin and notch1/nicd. this staining was lost in the intermediate and heppar <dig> positive differentiated hepatocytes during continuation of the ductular reaction . this is in line with the cytoplasmic and nuclear staining of β-catenin and notch1/nicd in the k7-positive undifferentiated hpcs in figure  <dig>  in all staining procedures, negative controls remained negative, indicating the specificity of the antibodies used.figure  <dig>

discussion
in the present study the involvement of the wnt/β-catenin and notch pathways was investigated in canine hepatic progenitor cell activation in ldh, a highly fibrotic and progressive liver disease. the combination of laser-microdissection, gene expression studies  and immunofluorescence showed the enhanced signalling of the wnt/β-catenin and notch pathways in activated hpc niches compared to quiescent hpcs in normal liver. this extends the findings in mouse and human liver cancer and normal liver regeneration  <cit> . the fact that this apparent activation was insufficient to restore the liver, dogs presenting with ldh die within a year after diagnosis  <cit> , suggests that therapeutic opportunities are present here. the reason why hpcs fail to regenerate the liver seems to vary with the type of disease and may be due to insufficient proliferation, migration or differentiation  <cit> . new therapeutic strategies could address the pathways involved in these phases of activation.

the effect of wnt/β-catenin was previously specified as  proliferation in rodent models of hpc activation  <cit> . similarly, a regulatory role for notch in hpc proliferation is described  <cit> . in ldh, the concurrent presence of active wnt and notch signalling and actively proliferating, ki <dig> positive cells in the ductular reaction suggest a potential role for these pathways in proliferation of canine hpcs during disease as well. another functional implication of wnt and notch signalling may relate to the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics by hpcs. the presence of mesenchymal characteristics can relate to migratory potential, which is not equivalent to full epithelial-mesenchymal transition , a disputed phenomenon in adult liver  <cit> . from a regenerative point of view, migration is necessary for hpcs to move toward the site of disease activity, and is likely to occur in concert with proliferation  <cit> . wnt and notch pathways have been implicated in emt and migratory potential of cells in different types of tissues and cancer development  <cit> . in canine ldh vimentin positive hpcs also exhibit wnt and notch signalling, potentially indicating a causative relation in canine hpcs. it will be of interest to further functionally investigate this newly suggested role of wnt or notch in migration of hpcs during disease, as it may provide interesting potential for therapeutic intervention.

besides the described role in proliferation and migration, both pathways can be involved in hpc differentiation. the influence of wnt on cell fate determination is time and place dependent. during early embryonic development and in pluripotent embryonic stem cells in vitro wnt activation leads to hepatic specification  <cit> . later in foetal liver development and in vitro in more committed multipotent cells, active wnt inhibits  hepatocyte differentiation but rather guides cells to the biliary phenotype  <cit> . regarding the hpc as a committed progenitor cell, wnt activation in ldh might stimulate bile duct differentiation and inhibit hepatocyte differentiation. an interesting finding in this study is that small hepatocytes lying in continuation with ductular cells, and possibly representing intermediate hepatocytes  <cit> , display a membranous β-catenin staining pattern  similar to that of hepatocytes in normal tissue. this supports the theory that the wnt/β-catenin pathway is no longer active during hepatocytic differentiation of ductular cells and is different from previous mouse data  <cit> . unfortunately, the lack of specific markers for intermediate hepatocytes limits their description to size and localization only  <cit> . the importance of notch in liver development and hepatocyte differentiation is apparent in the mutation in the notch ligand jag <dig>  which is associated with alagille syndrome, presenting with aberrant bile duct development  <cit> . more recently a distinctive role for the different notch receptors has been explored, suggesting that jag1-mediated notch <dig> and notch <dig> activation stimulates differentiation of hepatoblasts towards the biliary phenotype and inhibits hepatocytic differentiation. vice-versa, notch <dig> and notch <dig> expression would be lost when  cells differentiated towards hepatocytes  <cit> . converting these findings to the described results, it might be postulated that during ldh, where notch <dig> and notch <dig> expression is increased, hpc differentiation towards hepatocytes is inhibited, while bile duct differentiation may be enhanced. this is corroborated by the immunofluorescence stainings, where notch1/nicd is lost with differentiation.

the activated states of the wnt and notch pathway in the diseased tissue were found at the same histological location, suggesting that wnt and notch act simultaneously. in view of this, the wnt and notch pathways may be intertwined in the activation of hpcs during liver disease, as occurs for example when cell-fate decisions are made during development  <cit> . whether and how wnt and notch interact during hpc activation and in what manner this can be used for therapeutic benefit needs to be further investigated in molecular in vitro studies.

CONCLUSIONS
the combined q-pcr and immunofluorescence results extend existing literature on other species and indicate a critical role for wnt and notch in proliferation, differentiation and/or migration of canine hpcs during rapidly progressing fibrotic liver disease with hampered hepatocytic proliferation. the descriptive data presented here suggest a role in hpc activation; in vitro experiments with canine hepatic progenitor cells, at present not available, could shed light on these questions separately. these data from a non-experimental liver disease in client-owned pets confirm the previous separate reports on wnt and notch signalling in rat and mouse injury models of liver disease  <cit>  and human data  <cit> . in the future, the implementation of pre-clinical experiments with notch or wnt inhibitors in order to enhance liver regeneration in patients could be mutually beneficial for dog and man.
