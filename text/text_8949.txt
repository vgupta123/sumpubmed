BACKGROUND
more than ever, plants are essential to provide food, feed, fibers, and bioenergy to an ever-increasing world population. sustainable and efficient plant protection strategies are needed to ensure sufficient plant production by minimizing yield losses to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . conventionally, synthetic fungicides, pesticides, and herbicides are used to protect plants from biotic stress. however, such chemicals frequently also impair non-target organisms, often are poorly degradable, thus accumulating in the crop, soil, or both. in addition, resistances of pests, pathogens, and weeds to the agrochemicals in use continue to evolve  <cit> . thus, the need for an alternative crop protection strategy is becoming increasingly important.

an alternative, sustainable crop protection strategy primes the intrinsic plant immune system for enhanced defense to biotic and abiotic stress  <cit> . in fact, upon treatment with certain natural or synthetic compounds, plants can switch to a primed state of the alert. in the primed state, plants respond to biotic or abiotic challenges with faster and stronger activation of defense, and this often leads to immunity and/or stress tolerance .

in fact, the commercial success of some agrochemicals  at least in part relies on their ability to prime plants for enhanced defense. however, reliable test systems for identifying priming-inducing chemical compounds are rare. a recently reported high-throughput assay for immune-priming compounds assesses the enhancement of bacteria-induced cell death in arabidopsis culture cells by priming agents  <cit> . in addition to bacterial challenge, the test requires evans blue staining, washing, dye extraction, and extinction measurement. therefore, the screen is rather tedious.

in  <dig>  siegrist et al.  <cit>  reported that a fluorescence assay facilitates the identification of plant immune-priming compounds. the test relies on parsley culture cells and pep <dig>  a  <dig> amino-acid defense elicitor of phytophthora sojae  <cit> . the assay measures the enhancement of pep13-induced furanocoumarin  secretion upon pretreatment with priming activators  <cit> . the advantage of the test over competitive assays is the high sensitivity of furanocoumarin fluorescence detection and the use of only two subsequent treatments  before final analysis. for example, prolonged pretreatment  of the parsley cells with the plant defense signals jasmonic acid , salicylic acid , or the synthetic sa mimic benzothiadiazole  enhanced the pep13-activated secretion of antimicrobial furanocoumarin phytoalexins as detected by fluorescence spectroscopy  <cit> . a disadvantage of the test is its dependence of furanocoumarin secretion that is usually determined not until 24 h after pep <dig> challenge  <cit> .

in this study, we report that a respiration activity monitoring system   <cit>  can identify compounds with plant defense-priming activity. ramos enables the noninvasive online monitoring of the oxygen transfer rate  of parsley cells in suspension culture. as the storage capacity of aqueous solutions for oxygen is very small, the otr can be equaled to the oxygen uptake rate of parsley plant cells. the impact of sa and pep <dig> on the otr was investigated. furthermore, the impact of known priming-active  and priming-inactive  compounds was tested.

RESULTS
transfer of parsley cell cultures to the ramos device
the parsley cell culture was transferred to the ramos device to develop a simple, reliable assay to screen for defense priming compounds in plants. previous studies  already showed that the respiration activity of plant cells gives crucial information about their metabolism.

first, a standard experiment with priming by sa and subsequent pep <dig> challenge  <cit>  was conducted to evaluate the influence of each compound on the otr of the parsley cells in suspension cultures. an untreated culture without the addition of sa or pep <dig>  a culture treated exclusively with sa, and a culture treated exclusively with pep <dig> were run as references. figure  <dig> displays the otr of parsley cell cultures in these four experiments as a function of time.fig.  <dig> respiratory response of parsley cell suspension cultures after treatment with the priming compound sa and pep <dig>  oxygen transfer rate as a function of time of parsley suspension cultures treated with 100 μm salicylic acid  and  <dig> pm pep <dig> . reference cultivations: w/o additives , with addition of exclusively 100 μm sa , and with the addition of exclusively  <dig> pm pep <dig> . sa was added after 72 h and pep <dig> after 96 h. cultivation conditions: 250 ml flask volume, 50 ml filling volume, 180 rpm shaking frequency, 50 mm shaking diameter, and 25 °c. arrows indicate the addition of sa, pep <dig>  and sampling for the 2d-fluorescence measurements. experiments were conducted in duplicate 




all duplicate otr curves show great consistence . the otr curve of the untreated parsley cell culture showed a continuous increase until about 72 h. addition of 100 μm sa caused a  <dig> -fold increase in the otr compared to the untreated culture at 12 h post sa addition remaining on this level for another 12 h. addition of exclusively  <dig> pm pep <dig> at 96 h resulted in a first otr peak with a  <dig> -fold increase in the otr compared to the otr level of untreated cells . a second otr increase started to occur after 100 h. the otr of the cell culture treated with 100 μm sa and  <dig> pm pep <dig> showed both an increase in otr upon sa addition and two otr maxima after the addition of  <dig> pm pep <dig>  both maxima were more pronounced when compared to the culture treated with  <dig> pm pep <dig> exclusively.

previous studies provided two possible explanations for the enhanced oxygen consumption during priming of plant immunity: one explanation claimed that the activation of mitochondrial alternative oxidase  might cause enhanced oxygen consumption , whereas another explanation suggested that the synthesis of reactive oxygen species by the plasma membrane-localized nadph oxidase caused the enhanced oxygen consumption  <cit> . the two explanations, though being alternative, are not mutually exclusive, however. moreover, other oxygen consuming mechanisms in plant defense might be responsible for the observed increase in otr, for instance the generation of ros . a possible source of o2− that is affected by sa is the bona fide electron transport chain located within the mitochondrial membrane  <cit> . kawano and muto  suggested that sa prevents the cell from forming highly reactive hydroxyl radicals . instead, the tobacco cells produce less reactive o2−  <cit> . the superoxide dismutase  might further catalyze o2− to h2o <dig> and sa activates the sod in tobacco  <cit> . additionally, sa inhibits two enzymes which normally degrade h2o <dig>  catalase and ascorbate peroxidase, resulting in an increase in h2o <dig>  <cit> . thus, the increase in otr upon addition of sa could be explained by the activation of several oxygen-consuming mechanisms that in turn might influence the pep <dig> response.

addition of pep <dig> initiates the second, pronounced phase of enhanced oxygen consumption in parsley cells, which likely imitates presence of a pathogen. pep <dig> and other microbe-associated molecular patterns  activate a myriad of defense responses in plant cells  <cit> . in previous publications  <cit> , a h2o <dig> burst has been described which consists of two phases: a fast, seemingly unspecific generation of ros followed by a long-lasting, obviously pathogen-specific increase. nürnberger et al.  <cit>  stated that in parsley cells, pep <dig> activates the plasma membrane-bound nadh oxidase, resulting in o2− formation. subsequently, o2− can be converted to h2o <dig> and acts as an activator of gene expression in the nucleus  <cit> . since oxygen is needed for the formation of o2− and h2o <dig>  the increase in oxygen consumption of parsley cells upon pep <dig> addition  might serve the nadh-mediated oxidative burst  <cit> .

pretreatment with sa potentiated the otr burst induced by pep <dig> treatment, as shown in fig.  <dig>  both, the first and second otr peaks were more pronounced compared to the peaks of the culture exclusively treated with pep <dig>  if the otr burst reflects the oxidative burst, this potentiated oxygen consumption could be explained by enhanced h2o <dig> production  <cit> .

the qualitative determination of secreted furanocoumarin phytoalexins by fluorescence measurement had already been established for detection of defense priming  <cit> . fluorescence measurements at a single wavelength pair  were extended to 2d-fluorescence measurements . a possible shift in the intensity maximum due to minor changes in the furanocoumarin composition can be detected by 2d-specta. previous works have shown  <cit>  that the mamp influence the composition of secreted furanocoumarins. an influence of the candidate compound on the composition of secreted furanocoumarins upon pep <dig> addition might also be possible.fig.  <dig> fluorescence spectroscopy of pep13-induced furanocoumarins in parsley cell suspension cultures. cells were treated with the priming compound salicylic acid  after 72 h and with pep <dig> after 96 h. cell culture supernatant was taken 24 h after the addition of pep <dig> and subjected to 2d-fluorescence spectroscopy. experimental conditions: quartz cuvette, 3 ml filling volume, spectral range of 250–550 nm. reference cultivations: w/o additives , with the addition of exclusively 100 μm sa , and with the addition of exclusively  <dig> pm pep <dig> . the priming experiment includes the addition of 100 μm sa and  <dig> pm pep <dig> . all experiments are compared in  at an excitation wavelength of 335 nm and an emission wavelength of 400 nm . reference cultivations: w/o additives , with the addition of exclusively 100 μm salicylic acid  , and with the addition of exclusively  <dig> pm pep <dig> . the total fluorescence signals from the supernatants of the cultures were subtracted by the total fluorescence signal of the untreated culture. thereupon, the corrected fluorescence intensities of “100 μm sa”  and “ <dig> pm pep13”  were set to 100 %. the priming experiment contained both the addition of 100 μm sa and  <dig> pm pep <dig> 



figure 2a-c shows the culture supernatants of the three reference cultivations  after 120 h cultivation time. furthermore, fig. 2d depicts the supernatant of the culture treated with both sa and pep <dig> 

compared to the references , the supernatant of cells treated with sa and pep <dig>  showed a potentiated fluorescence intensity at about λexc = 335 nm and λem = 400 nm. furthermore, a distinctive shoulder was observed at about λexc = 330 nm and λem = 450 nm indicating that the signal results from a mixture of secreted furanocoumarins  <cit> . fig. 2e illustrates the relative fluorescence at a wavelength pair of λexc = 335 nm and λem = 400 nm for better comparison. treatment with 100 μm sa and subsequent addition of  <dig> nm pep <dig>  resulted in a  <dig> -fold increase in fluorescence intensity compared to the additive signal of the references. the potentiated effect of sa treatment on furanocoumarin secretion and subsequent pep <dig> addition has been shown in previous publications  <cit> .

influence of sa and pep <dig> concentrations on the otr
for a better understanding of the respiratory response of parsley cell cultures in terms of defense priming, varying concentrations of sa and pep <dig> were applied. the two otr curves shown in fig.  <dig> greatly match. subsequently, single measurements are shown for the experiments. for better comparability of the measurements between experiments throughout this work, the untreated culture and the culture treated with 100 μm sa and subsequently challenged with  <dig> pm pep <dig> were conducted as reference cultivations in each experiment. hence, the biological variation was considered for the independent experiments. the otr at identical experimental conditions of different individual ramos experiments, however, show slight differences due to variations in the physiological state of the maintained culture used for inoculation.

first, the sa concentration was varied and the pep <dig> concentration was kept constant at  <dig> pm. in addition to the standard experiment with 100 μm sa and  <dig> pm pep <dig>  fig.  <dig> illustrates the otr of two other priming experiments with 10 μm and 50 μm sa. an untreated parsley culture serves as a reference.fig.  <dig> respiratory responses of parsley cell suspension cultures dependent on the sa concentration. oxygen transfer rate  as a function of time for three salicylic acid  concentrations and a reference without additives . 10 μm sa and  <dig> pm pep <dig> , 50 μm sa and  <dig> pm pep <dig> , and 100 μm sa and  <dig> pm pep <dig> . arrows indicate the addition of sa after 72 h and pep <dig> after 96 h. cultivation conditions: 250 ml flask volume, 50 ml filling volume, 180 rpm shaking frequency, 50 mm shaking diameter, and 25 °c



both a noticeable increase in the otr after sa addition and two otr peaks after  <dig> pm pep <dig> treatment were visible, as already shown in fig.  <dig>  the lower the concentration of sa used, the smaller was the increase in otr. consequently, the otr burst induced by pep <dig> addition was also less pronounced after pretreatment with a lower concentration of sa. however, in all three batches the primary peak induced by pep <dig> addition exceeded the one that occurred after exclusive pep <dig> addition . this observation agrees with findings of kauss et al.  <cit>  who detected a correlation between the extracellular h2o <dig> concentration after elicitation and the sa concentration used for priming.

a greater change in sa concentration in a different experiment, however, showed the limit of this experimental setup. as little as 1 μm sa did not cause any detectable change in the otr and pep <dig> did not potentiate the otr burst . since the fluorescence measurements also did not show a potentiation , this finding indicates that a minimum level of sa is necessary to activate a detectable primed state in parsley cells. the treatment of cells with 200 μm sa did not lead to a further increase in the otr compared to the otr upon addition of 100 μm sa. in contrast, the relative furanocoumarin fluorescence of parsley cells treated with 200 μm sa increased, compared to the cells pretreated with 100 μm sa. this result suggests that the increase in otr is most likely due to priming since a direct activation of defense responses would probably be stronger upon addition of higher sa concentrations as it is for other defense markers  <cit> . the otr burst also occurred upon pep <dig> addition when pretreating cells with 100 μm and 200 μm sa . in tobacco cell cultures, a sigmoidal correlation of sa concentration on catalase activity, and thus an inhibitory effect have been demonstrated, suggesting that significant inhibition of catalase activity requires at least 200 μm sa  <cit> . however, in parsley cell cultures, 10 μm sa increased the otr and potentiated furanocoumarin synthesis . this might be due to subcellular distribution and -storage of sa, or species specificity. the immediate sa response of the respiratory activity in parsley cells is dose-dependent.

the impact of different pep <dig> concentrations on respiratory activity in sa-primed parsley cells was also investigated . in these experiments, the sa concentration was kept constant at 100 μm. priming experiments with 100 μm sa and  <dig> pm,  <dig> pm and  <dig> pm pep <dig> were performed as illustrated in fig.  <dig>  an untreated culture served as reference cultivation. again, sa addition resulted in an increase in the otr . the respiratory response of parsley cells correlated with the pep <dig> concentration used. after addition of  <dig> pm pep <dig>  the otr showed a prominent otr burst and a small secondary peak. a lower concentration of  <dig> pm sa resulted in a less pronounced otr burst, but the secondary peak was more pronounced compared to the one occurring after the addition of  <dig> pm pep <dig> . the addition of only  <dig> pm pep <dig> caused no otr burst, but the secondary peak was more prominent. however, compared to the otr of the culture exclusively treated with 100 μm sa, this increase was rather marginal . as discussed before, the first otr peak induced by pep <dig> might represent an unspecific response, whereas the second one indicates a specific response  <cit> . the immediate response of the cells was greater with higher pep <dig> concentrations. additionally, the greater the primary otr burst, the smaller the secondary response. if the otr burst correlates with an increase in h2o <dig> concentration, this phenomenon can be explained by the influence of h2o <dig> that can be cytotoxic  <cit> . the decrease in otr after a pronounced otr burst is greater than the decrease in otr when only a little burst occurred . the negative influence of the otr burst on the respiration activity supports the hypothesis that h2o <dig> accumulated. if the synthesis of h2o <dig> accounts for the otr burst, the increased effect on cell viability could be the reason for lower concentration of secreted furanocoumarin at higher pep <dig> concentrations .fig.  <dig> pep <dig> dose-dependent respiratory responses of parsley cell suspension cultures. oxygen transfer rate  as a function of time for three pep <dig> concentrations and a reference without additives . addition of 100 μm sa and  <dig> pm pep <dig> , 100 μm sa and  <dig> pm pep <dig> , and 100 μm sa and  <dig> pm pep <dig> . arrows indicate the addition of sa and pep <dig>  cultivation conditions: 250 ml flask volume, 50 ml filling volume, 180 rpm shaking frequency, 50 mm shaking diameter, and 25 °c

in summary, the sa and pep <dig> concentrations affect respiratory activity and furanocoumarin synthesis. since the occurrence of an otr increase after sa addition correlates with the furanocoumarin fluorescence measurements, the otr increase seems to be a suitable indicator of priming activity.

influence of sa derivatives on the otr
in the previous sections, a correlation between the increase in the otr of sa-pretreated parsley cells and the potentiation of furanocoumarin secretion was demonstrated. if an increase in the otr is a measure of priming activity, the expectation is that compounds inducing defense priming would, while priming-negative compounds would not induce an increase in oxygen consumption. consequently, sa derivatives known as priming-active and priming-inactive compounds were tested for their potential to increase the oxygen consumption in parsley cells.

figure  <dig> presents the otr as a function of time for the priming compounds sa and 4-chlorosa , as well as the priming-negative compound 3-hydroxybenzoic acid . all three cultures were also treated with  <dig> pm pep <dig>  an untreated culture served as a reference. in addition, the effect of the priming-inactive compound 4-hydroxybenzoic acid  was investigated .

both the addition of 100 μm sa and 100 μm 4-csa resulted in an increase in the otr. the increase after the addition of sa was greater than the one after 4-csa addition. consequently, parsley cell cultures pretreated with sa and 4-csa showed potentiated pep13-activated oxygen consumption. treatment with the priming-inactive compounds 3-hba  or 4-hba  did not result in a change in otr compared to the untreated reference culture. the otr burst had the same intensity as the otr burst of the culture exclusively treated with pep <dig> .

the results presented above demonstrate that the addition of priming compounds results in an increase in the otr, whereas priming-negative compounds do not do so. conrath et al.  <cit>  revealed that either sa or 4-csa treated cells showed an inhibitory effect on catalase activity, which was assumed to cause the observed accumulation of ros. in contrast, priming-inactive sa derivatives such as 3-hba and 4-hba did not affect catalase activity  <cit> . again, fluorescence intensities were measured to support the otr results. pretreatment with sa or 4-csa potentiated the fluorescence intensity as illustrated in additional file  <dig>  treatment with 3-hba or 4-hba did not result in potentiation. thulke et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the activation of genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway is stronger in parsley cells upon pretreatment with sa or 4-csa. 3-hba does not cause this potentiation  <cit> . the addition of priming-active sa derivatives resulted in a conspicuous increase in the otr ; the addition of priming-inactive sa derivatives, however, did not have a detectable effect. our results suggest that an increase in respiratory activity upon addition of a candidate compound can provide reliable information of whether that compound has defense priming-inducing activity in plants.

influence of methyl jasmonate and pyraclostrobin on the otr
the discrimination between priming-active and priming-inactive compounds based on the otr was successfully presented for sa and some of its derivatives. figure  <dig> depicts the otr as a function of time for methyl jasmonate   and the strobilurin fungicide pyraclostrobin  . both compounds are known to induce priming . after addition of meja or f <dig> the otr increase was greater when compared to the reference cultivation that was treated with dmso. thus, the increase in otr is directly related to the addition of meja or f <dig>  the otr burst after pep <dig> addition, however, is smaller as compared to the otr burst after sa pretreatment and subsequent pep <dig> addition. this result shows that compounds addressing a metabolic pathway different than sa  <cit>  still stimulate the respiration activity of parsley cells.fig.  <dig> respiratory response of parsley cell suspension cultures after treatment with meja , f <dig> . otr as a function of time for meja + pep <dig>  and f500 + pep <dig> . both compounds were dissolved in  <dig>  %  dmso. a parsley cell culture treated with  <dig>  %  dmso only, and a cell culture treated with 100 μm sa dissolved in dmso served as a reference. cultivation conditions: 250 ml flask volume, 50 ml filling volume, 180 rpm shaking frequency, 50 mm shaking diameter, and 25 °c. arrow indicates the addition of the compounds and pep <dig> derivatives



CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we introduced the online measured otr in shake flasks, as a complimentary technique to the conventional furanocoumarin fluorescence assay in parsley cell cultures. an increase in otr upon treatment with a candidate compound is consistent with an enhanced pep13-induced secretion of furanocoumarin phytoalexins. for the parsley cell culture system the ramos device provides an immediate, noninvasive, and additional signal for the identification of priming compounds. a fingerprint of the cell culture is obtained by the online measurement of the respiration activity rather than a conventional end point determination of the furanocoumarins. furthermore, the respiration activity is an overall signal that could be transferred to other plant species. this would also enable the screening for priming compounds for particular crops.
