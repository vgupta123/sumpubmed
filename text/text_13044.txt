BACKGROUND
in eurkaryotic organisms, dna is found associated with histone proteins constituting a nucleoprotein complex called chromatin. approximately  <dig> base pairs of dna wrap around a core histone octamer to form a nucleosome which is the basic subunit of chromatin. this nucleoprotein complex allows for the high extent of compaction of genomic dna within the cell nucleus and provides the support on which most dna metabolic processes take place  <cit> . there are five histone families which can be classified into core histones  and linker histones  according to structural and functional features. the histone h <dig> and h2a families show the most diversity of isoforms that have dedicated functions in many cellular processes including organization of chromatin structure in somatic and germinal cells, gene transcription, dna replication, and dna repair among others  <cit> .

the histone h2a family contains the greatest number of variants among the core histones, some of which are essential for the maintenance of genome integrity and viability such as h2a.z and h2a.x  <cit> . at present, h2a.z is one of the most heavily studied histone variants and it has been ascribed multiple functions that may differ among species. in yeast, h2a.z  is present at active and inactive gene promoters in euchromatin, it is depleted at the silenced subtelomeric heterochromatin and it is enriched at the boundaries between euchromatin and heterochromatin  <cit> . although studies concerning the function of h2a.z in mammalian cells have always yielded results that seem difficult to reconcile, a growing body of evidence suggests that h2a.z is present at gene promoters and that in an acetylated form, its presence correlates with gene expression  <cit> . however, it appears there are also at least two populations of h2a.z present in heterochromatin. greaves and colleagues show that h2a.z is a feature of pericentric heterochromatin and contributes to the structure of the centromere  <cit> . another fraction of h2a.z stains the length of the inactive x chromosome though intriguingly this fraction can be distinguished by monoubiquitination at k <dig>  k <dig> or k <dig>  <cit> .

analysis of the h2a.z-containing nucleosome has also yielded conflicting results  <cit> . the crystal structure of this nucleosome initially suggested a subtle destabilization between the h2a.z-h2b dimer and the h3-h <dig> tetramer  <cit> . however, fret and analytical ultracentrifuge analysis using native h2a.z have indicated that the h2a.z nucleosome is in fact slightly more stable than the canonical h2a nucleosome  <cit> . also, when h2a.z is present in nucleosome arrays it facilitates the formation of the  <dig> nm chromatin fiber  <cit> . the recent study by sarcinella and colleagues showed that it is a monoubiquitinated form of h2a.z that is present on the inactive x chromosome  <cit> . this study is a clear demonstration that a post-translational modification has the potential to define a subpopulation of h2a.z. indeed, a similar situation can be seen with h2a.z n-terminal acetylation and active gene transcription  <cit> . the difference in ptms could reflect the different functional constraints of the h2a.z-containing mono-nucleosomes in the in vivo setting. conversely, the tendency to fold the chromatin fiber in arrays consisting of contiguous h2a.z-containing nucleosomes may account for the presence of this variant in physiologically relevant situations such as that found in association with pcg proteins in the polycomb genes  <cit>  or at the flanking sites of the insulator protein ctcf  <cit> .

mass spectrometry analysis showed that purified h2a.z consists of an almost equimolar amount of two similar yet distinct proteins that differ by three amino acids  <cit>  which are labeled here as h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig>  in the present work we have explored the long-term evolutionary pathway of h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> differentiation across metazoans and have analyzed the possible selective mechanisms and the constraints responsible for the potential functionalization of both variants. our results have important implications for histone evolution and function as they show for the first time that h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> represent two very closely related variants that share a common evolutionary origin early in chordate evolution. furthermore, our results show that the evolutionary constraints leading to the differentiation of both variants are primarily acting at the nucleotide level. this involves a refined process of stepwise mutation change within the codons of their three characteristic amino acid residues. finally, we show that h2a.z- <dig> is more tightly controlled  by selection than h2a.z- <dig> 

RESULTS
the phylogenetic context of h2a histone variants
the phylogeny including the sequences for all h2a histone variants known to date is shown in fig.  <dig> . it can be seen that some of these variants including histone h2a.bbd  <cit> , macroh2a  <cit> , and the group comprising h2a.z variants  <cit>  have a monophyletic origin. histone h2a.x shows a recurrent differentiation across evolution, implying that it has had multiple evolutionary origins as previously reported  <cit> . the single evolutionary origin of the remaining h2a variants is strongly supported by high levels of confidence in topology. their distinctive identity with respect to the canonical h2a histones has been maintained since this origin. the clustering pattern in the tree is consistent with the functional diversification and differentiation of the histone subtypes based on a birth-and-death model of evolution  <cit> , ruling out a major effect of a concerted evolution mechanism.

as mentioned earlier, purified h2a.z consists of two different forms. while one component of this mixture is referred to as h2a.z, the other component is represented by a protein which was initially labeled as h2a.f/z or h2a.v, which in humans differs at three residues from h2a.z as follows: h2a.z-thr → h2a.v-ala , h2a.z-ser → h2a.v-thr , h2a.z-val → h2a.v-ala . considering the small amino acid differences existing among h2a.z, h2a.f and h2a.v and given that any of their protein sequences is closer to h2a.z than to any other histone h2a variant, we will refer to them here as h2a.z- <dig> , h2a.z- <dig>  and h2a.z-e. the latter corresponds to histone h2a.z from organisms preceding and including the early chordates, which is present previous to the differentiation between h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> that takes place in vertebrates . histone h2a.z- <dig> has been mainly identified from cdna libraries and during the annotation process of different genomes yet exhaustive studies on this variant are still lacking. our preliminary biochemical results  reveal the co-existence of both h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> mrnas in chicken as well as in mammalian cells, showing significant differences in their expression levels across different tissues. despite being preliminary, these results may lend support to the notion that h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> are functionally distinct and that they could act independently to fulfill the different roles played by the histone h2a.z fraction in chromatin structure and function.

we have performed extensive dna and protein database mining based on the differences exhibited by h2a.z- <dig>  and h2a.z- <dig>  in three amino acid residues . the analysis made use of all the h2a.z- <dig> sequences available, including those whose functionality has been assessed, predicted and even sequences in silico isolated from draft genomes. we obtained  <dig> h2a.z- <dig> and  <dig> h2a.z- <dig> sequences from chordates, which in many instances had been incorrectly annotated in the databases . inclusion of all h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> variants in the h2a protein phylogeny  shows that their sequences overlap extensively without any evident functional clustering pattern or high confidence levels for the groups defined by the topology. this suggests that the differentiation between h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> has occurred beyond the triresidue difference that is observed in vertebrates.

therefore, a phylogeny based on the complete nucleotide coding regions was reconstructed in order to further investigate the mechanisms of differentiation between h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig>  in contrast to the protein phylogeny, this defines a clear pattern between h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> in vertebrates , with a monophyletic origin which is already independent from that of h2a.z-e genes in early chordates, protostomes and fungi.

two exceptions to this clustering pattern were detected. in the first instance, histones h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> from zebrafish are included in the same group. this could be due to a recent gene duplication within a short period of time . under such circumstances, the presence of gene conversion would be unlikely because h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> genes are located on different chromosomes in zebrafish. another exception was observed for the h2a.z- <dig> genes from x. laevis which fall into an independent group outside both the h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> clusters. given that the h2a.z- <dig> gene from x. tropicalis and those of x. laevis and x. tropicalis h2a.z- <dig> fall within their corresponding groups in the tree, the independent position of x. laevis h2a.z- <dig> could be due to the extensive nucleotide variation exhibited among h2a genes.

the phylogeny from fig.  <dig> represents a very useful tool in defining the identity of vertebrate h2a variants as either h2a.z- <dig> or h2a.z- <dig> on the basis of their nucleotide sequences. indeed, the current topology allowed us to define  <dig> sequences previously annotated as h2a either as h2a.z- <dig> or h2a.z- <dig> following their position on the tree. furthermore,  <dig> of those sequences were previously annotated as unknown in the databases, and thus the present analysis helped to reveal their true identity. in two instances  these sequences were wrongly defined as h2a.z- <dig> in the databases, and our analyses unveiled their h2a.z- <dig> identity . such a clear differentiation between both histone h2a.z forms using nucleotide phylogeny suggests not only a common phylogenetic origin early in metazoan evolution, but also the presence of a process of functional differentiation similar to that described for other histone multigene families  <cit> . however, the differentiation among other histone family members commonly encompasses extensive synonymous divergence under strong purifying selection at the protein level  <cit> . in contrast, the differentiation between h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> seems to primarily involve variation at the nucleotide level which in vertebrates resulted in a subtle protein differentiation encompassing three different amino acid residues. such structural amino acid refinement represents a new mechanism among those previously known in histone diversification and is further investigated below.

protein and nucleotide variation in h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> variants
the amino acid sequence alignments shown in fig. 3a and additional file  <dig> highlight the high extent of protein similarity between h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig>  this is especially evident when comparing the sequences in the same species, as in the case of human h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> . the alignment reveals the presence in vertebrates of only three residue differences  defined as: thr → ala , ser → thr , and val → ala . the amino acid residues involved in the acidic patch of h2a  <cit>  that are presumably involved in interchromosomal contacts within the chromatin fibre  <cit>  are maintained in both h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> in contrast to what has been observed in other h2a variants such as h2abbd  <cit> . although the second amino acid of the triresidue falls within the a-helix  <dig> domain of the histone fold  <cit> , a computer analysis using molecular dynamic simulation  indicated that such variation has no structural implications for secondary or tertiary structure of these histone variants .

given the highly charged nature of histones and their involvement in protein-dna interactions that modulate chromatin dynamics, the electrostatic interaction properties of the different h2a variants were analyzed. electrostatic potentials and the corresponding similarity indices were calculated for all h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> proteins listed in additional file  <dig>  allowing us to calculate the electrostatic distances between proteins . as expected from additional file  <dig>  this analysis showed that the differentiation process between h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> does not involve significant differences in electrostatic potentials within different taxonomic groups

the low levels of protein variation observed in the course of evolution both within and between h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> variants are clearly emphasized when estimating the amino acid p-distances . however, the amino acid sequence variation is slightly higher among h2a.z- <dig>  compared to h2a.z- <dig> or even to h2a.z-e . analysis of the variation at the nucleotide level  reveals an inverse correlation with respect to the amino acid variation of h2a.z- <dig>  h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z-e from early chordates . the nature of the nucleotide variation is essentially synonymous and significantly greater than the nonsynonymous variation in all cases . in an attempt to gain further insight into the evolutionary processes underlying h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> variability, we analyzed the amounts of total and synonymous nucleotide variation across both molecules as well as in the case of h2a.z-e from early chordates. such analyses provide useful information regarding the presence of functional constraints affecting the structural domains of proteins and have been successfully used in previous studies  <cit> .

an additional insight into the evolution of h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> can be obtained from their overall variation. the values shown in table  <dig>  indicate the presence of an extensive silent divergence between histones h2a.z- <dig>  h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z-e with very similar magnitudes . however, protein distances reveal a different picture that is characterized by the close proximity between h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z-e , which is lower than the distance between h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z-e  and significantly lower than the overall distance between h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> variants from vertebrates . these results support the presence of a mechanism of functional diversification and differentiation which most likely fits a birth-and-death model of evolution. this is based on the extensive synonymous nucleotide variation observed within and between variants as well as on the strong purifying selection constraining h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> at the protein level, which is similar to what is observed for all other histone families studied until now  <cit> . contrary to other multigene families, the contribution of concerted evolution  to h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> long-term evolution can be disregarded considering the different chromosomal location of both forms in all organisms studied . in addition, both h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> seem to be more closely related to h2a.z-e from early chordates than to one another, supporting the idea of a common origin for both variants in early deuterostomes following a subsequent process of differentiation later on in evolution. indeed, the constraints operating on h2a.z- <dig> at the nucleotide level during this differentiation process seem to be somewhat more relaxed compared with those operating on h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z-e. our results also reveal that h2a.z- <dig> is as divergent from h2a.z- <dig> as they both are from canonical h2a, a divergence that at the nucleotide level operates in all instances over the same regions of the protein . this diversification between h2a.z-1/h2a.z- <dig> and canonical h2a should be clearly distinguished from the relaxation in the constraints bewtween h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> to which we are going to subsequently refer in the text.

the nature of the selective constraints operating on h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> histones
at the protein level, the evolutionary mechanisms leading to the differential identity of h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> seem to be operating beyond a process of purifying selection. therefore, we decided to investigate the levels of codon usage bias in both genes in order to analyze the effect of selection at the nucleotide level. differences in codon bias are common between different histone multigene families, more or less independently of the particular organisms studied  <cit> . indeed, our results reveal significant differences between the h2a variants analyzed, with h2a.z- <dig>  exhibiting a significantly higher bias than h2a.z- <dig> . such results have important implications for the evolutionary constraints affecting both histone types at the nucleotide level. interestingly, no such significant difference in codon bias has ever been previously reported between histone variants belonging to the same histone multigene family, due to the presence of a strong purifying selection acting at the protein level as a major evolutionary force that leads to an extensive and homogeneous silent variation at the nucleotide level  <cit> . also, the codon bias analyses are in agreement with the previous results at the amino acid level indicating also that h2a.z- <dig> is less constrained than h2a.z- <dig> at the nucleotide level. furthermore, histone h2a.z-e from early chordates displays an intermediate overall codon bias magnitude  which is not significantly different from either h2a.z- <dig> or from h2a.z- <dig> . these results suggest that the differences in the intensity of the selective constraints operating on h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> probably arose during the differentiation of both variants from a common ancestor, represented here by h2a.z-e from early chordates.

among other potential causes, differences in codon usage bias can be related to the preferential use of certain preferred triplets encoding overrepresented amino acids in the proteins, as occurs in highly basic proteins such as histones  <cit> . the most abundant residues in h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> proteins are represented by glycine and alanine  and lysine and isoleucine . the presence of selection for such biased amino acids in these classes was thus analyzed by studying the correlation between the frequency of gc-rich and gc-poor amino acids with the genomic gc content . we found that correlations between gc content and the frequency of gc-rich amino acids and gc-poor amino acids were not significant neither in h2a.z- <dig> nor h2a.z- <dig> . similarly, the correlations between gc content and the most represented amino acids in each class  were not significant either, as indicated in table  <dig>  these results indicate a departure from the neutral model of molecular evolution, which hypothesizes that gc-rich and gc-poor amino acids will be positively and negatively correlated with genomic gc content, respectively  <cit> .

an additional method to gauge the significance of mutation bias and selection at the nucleotide level involves the comparison of changes at first codon positions  with changes at fourfold positions  in the most frequent residues in h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig>  under the neutral model the nucleotide frequencies at both positions should not be significantly different  <cit> . codons for glycine and alanine  contain g at first codon positions, whereas codons for lysine and isoleucine  have a at first codon positions. analysis of the mean g + a content at first codon positions in h2a.z- <dig>  and h2a.z- <dig>  showed that their values were significantly larger than the mean g + a content at fourfold degenerate positions in h2a.z- <dig>  and h2a.z- <dig> , . the values are significantly different in all species analyzed . while the neutral model of molecular evolution predicts that amino acid and nucleotide compositions are driven by the underlying gc content as a result of mutation bias, our results strongly suggest that selection has acted to maintain high levels of glycine, alanine, lysine and isoleucine in h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> variants, biasing their nucleotide composition. few studies have shown that natural selection is more important than mutation bias in determining amino acid composition of proteins  <cit> . in this regard, our observations with h2a.z stand in contrast to the neutral model.

the progressive differentiation of h2a variants is mediated by stepwise mutations
the analyses presented in this work indicate that selective constraints governing h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> evolution go far beyond the protein level, as shown by the significant differences detected in codon usage bias and the presence of selection for highly biased amino acid composition that influences the nucleotide composition. however, the specific mechanisms responsible for the subtle differentiation between both forms and the functional meaning of this process remain obscure. in order to define possible functional selective targets in these proteins we decided to look at the codon usage of the amino acids of the triresidue that defines the identity of vertebrate h2a.z- <dig>  and h2a.z- <dig> . the codons involved, which are indicated near each of the h2a sequences analyzed in the phylogeny shown in fig.  <dig>  show a high degree of conservation of codon in each histone form and within each taxonomic group.

starting from early chordates, the amino acid triresidue defined as ala/asp/thr eventually leads to the actual triresidues from both mammalian h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig>  paying attention to the triplet encoding the first amino acid in the triresidue of h2a.z-e from early chordates, we can trace a stepwise mutation pathway leading to the actual residue in the corresponding position of mammalian h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig>  for instance the first amino acid in the triresidue from early chordates is alanine , which undergoes two synonymous mutations leading to the corresponding actual residue in mammalian h2a.z- <dig> , with an intermediate synonymous mutation step represented by h2a.z- <dig> from amphibians . similarly, the pathway leading to the first residue of h2a.z- <dig> would involve an intermediate synonymous mutation step in amphibians  and a final nonsynonymous step in the first codon position leading to mammalian h2a.z- <dig> . it is important to point out that only one nucleotide at a given position in the codon changes in every step, with the remaining two positions being invariable. this mechanism is schematically shown in fig.  <dig> which outlines the pathways starting from the amino acids in the triresidue from early chordates to the triresidue from mammalian h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig>  through an intermediate step represented by nonmammalian vertebrates . this phenomenom reveals a very unique evolutionary process in which the evolution of the whole protein, leading either towards h2a.z- <dig> or h2a.z- <dig>  is driven by the composition of the triresidue both at the amino acid and at the nucleotide levels.

although the overall mutation pathway is stepwise, there are two instances in which more than one nucleotide change occurs in the same step: the change from aac  to tct  in the second amino acid of the triresidue, and from aca  to gtc  in the third amino acid of the triresidue. these multiple changes occur in the pathway towards h2a.z- <dig>  further illustrating the less constrained status of this variant compared to h2a.z- <dig>  indeed, the pathways leading towards h2a.z- <dig> involve an overall number of two amino acid replacements and four synonymous subtitutions, compared to the three amino acid replacements and two synonymous substitutions in the case of the h2a.z- <dig>  it is important to note here that the pathway leading towards h2a.z- <dig> always ends using the triplet with higher relative synonymous codon usage within each of the three residues, while the codons in the case of h2a.z- <dig> are always less preferred with the exception of serine. it is thus possible to identify a trend underlying the codon usage across these pathways, starting with triplets with low relative synonymous codon usage  in the triresidue from early chordates, triplets with medium rscu in the second step and triplets with maximum rscu in the case of h2a.z- <dig> and minimum rscu in h2a.z- <dig>  additional support for the higher levels of variation within h2a.z- <dig> can be obtained from the estimation of the pattern of nucleotide substitutions shown in table  <dig>  by examining the overall number of nucleotide substitutions involved in the stepwise mutation model previously described, we found that from the six nucleotide changes involved in the pathway leading to mammalian h2a.z- <dig>  two reach maximum levels of probability as estimated in table  <dig>  in contrast, the same observation is made in six out of the nine nucleotide changes leading to h2a.z- <dig>  this suggests that this variant accumulates a sufficiently large number of nucleotide changes as to influence the maximum composite likelihood estimation of the probability of substitution of one nucleotide for another in h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> 

maximum composite likelihood estimation of the probability of substitution from one base  to another base  instantaneously.

CONCLUSIONS
the function of histone h2a.z in gene activation/silencing is still an important topic in chromatin research, as no clear mechanism for its structural and functional variability has yet been proposed. in this regard, the presence of two different h2a.z forms is especially interesting  <cit> . although very little is known about h2a.z- <dig>  the results presented in this work definitively reveal that its existence is not a whim of random genetic drift. the functional significance of h2a.z- <dig> is still obscure, however our group has been able to demonstrate the coexistence of both h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> in chicken and human tissues, and that significant differences in their mrna expression levels exist and in this regard, it is very likely that the key to the existence of these two functional h2a.z forms resides within their promoter regions . our analyses demonstrate not only that h2a.z- <dig> is subject to a strong purifying selection  but that in fact it is significantly more evolutionarily constrained than h2a.z- <dig> 

nevertheless, it appears that this selection does not proceed in conventional ways. while phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses reveal a typical process of birth-and-death evolution with strong purifying selection leading to the differentiation of h2a family members  <cit> , an almost identical primary structure has been conserved between h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> except for three amino acid differences. this is surprising considering that the two forms occupy different chromosomal locations  and that they have resulted from a progressive differentiation across vertebrates starting from a common ancestor early in chordate evolution. the main evolutionary constraints directing the limited amino acid variation between h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> are primarily acting at the nucleotide level. this defines a process of stepwise mutation change in the codons constituting the triresidue which mirrors h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig> evolution.

according to clapier et al., the amino acid sequence changes observed in the protein variants throughout the highly constrained evolution of histones, are of little structural but decisive functional consequences  <cit> . indeed, is worthwhile to mention that knocking out h2a.z- <dig> in mice results in lethality and therefore , h2a.z- <dig> cannot replace h2a.z- <dig> . in the instance of h2a.z- <dig> and h2a.z- <dig>  the difference in amino acid sequence variability is minimal and it affects only three residues. yet, we have observed a much closer proximity of the constraints imposed at the nucleotide level between the sequence of the genes encoding h2a.z- <dig> and the histone h2a.z ancestor  when compared to h2az- <dig>  this suggests that in the transition from chordates to vertebrates, the h2a.z- <dig> has arisen to acquire a novel, or most likely complementary functions.
