BACKGROUND
cuticular wax, as the major chemical component of plant cuticles, plays important physiological and ecological roles in the interactions between plants and their abiotic and biotic environments  <cit> . it has become clear that cuticular wax deposition could prevent water loss through leaf epidermis  <cit> ; reduce water retention on leaf surface  <cit> ; protect plant against enhanced ultraviolet radiation  <cit> ; defend plant against pathogen attack  <cit> ; and protect plant against air pollution and weathering  <cit> . the cuticular waxes are very long chain fatty acids , consisting of hydrocarbons such as n-alkanes, primary alcohols, aliphatic ketones, n-alkanoic acids, as well as esters, aldehydes, and secondary alcohols  <cit> . studies have shown that wax compositions differ in their functions and responses to abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> . therefore, understanding the synthesis and transportation of each cuticular wax composition is necessary in utilizing cuticular waxes to improve crop productivity and plant ecological adaptation.

wax biosynthesis begins with de novo c <dig> or c <dig> fatty acid biosynthesis in the plastid of epidermal cells. then using the c <dig> or c <dig> acyl-coa and malonylcoenzyme a as substrates, fatty acid elongase  complex performs a reiterative cycle of four reactions catalyzed by a β-ketoacyl-coa synthase , a β-ketoacyl-coa reductase , a β-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydratase , and an enoyl-coa reductase , to produce saturated vlcfas with 24– <dig> carbon atoms. these vlcfas are further modified to various wax molecules through two major pathways, the acyl-reduction and the decarbonylation pathways  <cit> . using wax-deficient mutants, some genes encoding enzymes involved in these wax biosynthesis pathways have been cloned and characterized. the mutant loci in arabidopsis thaliana are termed eceriferum , and  <dig> independent cer loci have been identified in this plant model  <cit> . for example, cer6/kcs <dig> and cer <dig> have been identified for encoding kcs and ecr involved in vlcfas biosynthesis  <cit> . cer <dig> encodes long-chain acyl-coa synthetase  catalyzing free fatty acids to coa  <cit> . cer <dig>  cer <dig> and mah <dig> encode enzymes involved in the decarbonylation pathway which produces aldehydes, alkanes, secondary alcohols, and ketones  <cit> . cer <dig> and wsd <dig> encode enzymes involved in the acyl reduction which forms primary alcohol and wax esters  <cit> . cer5/abcg <dig>  <cit>  and abcg <dig>  <cit> , which belong to atp-binding cassette  transporters, were reported to be required for arabidopsis wax export. the identification of these wax-related genes helps understanding the production of cuticular wax and their functions.

understanding the development of wax depositions during plant growth also provides an alternative way in screening cuticular wax genes. a microarray study on arabidopsis by costaglioli et al.  showed that comparison of gene expression between  wax synthesizing and  not wax-synthesizing shoot tissue was better suited for screening wax-related genes than comparison of expression between wild-type and cer mutant plants  <cit> . for monocotyledonous plants, rhee et al.  analyzed the wax deposition along the length of expanding leek  and found that the level of total cuticular wax increased along the length of the leaf and the microsomal fatty acid elongation activities were induced within a defined and identifiable region of the expanding leek leaf  <cit> . in grasses, richardson et al.  reported that cutin deposition in barley leaf epidermis occurred in parallel with cell elongation, whereas deposition of significant amounts of wax commenced as cells ceased to elongate  <cit> . based on this finding, richardson et al.  compared expression of candidate contig-sequences between leaf elongation zone, non-elongation zone and emerged blade zone, and identified candidate genes involved in wax deposition on barley leaves through a microarray approach  <cit> .

poa pratensis l, also known as kentucky bluegrass, is a perennial forage and turf grass species that is well adapted to a wide range of mesic to moist habitats, and temperate to alpine conditions  <cit> . pertierra et al.  also reported that it was the longest surviving non-native vascular plant colony known in antarctica from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . the proportion of total cuticular wax present as alkanes was the highest in the alpine poa species compared to low land poa species  <cit> , implying that the wide distribution of p. pratensis might be attributed to its ability in adjusting cuticular wax depositions. the rna-seq is a powerful, recently developed, high-throughput sequencing method, and provides new approaches to explore functional genes. in this study, we performed the pair end transcriptome sequencing of leaf non-elongation zone  and the emerged blade zone  of p. pratensis using the illumina hiseq platform. a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads were obtained and assembled into  <dig>  unigenes. thousands of potential simple sequence repeats  molecular markers were discovered. about  <dig> unigenes were differentially expressed between two leaf zones and a number of unigenes involved in cuticular wax deposition were identified. twelve putative differentially expressed unigenes involved in cuticular wax biosynthesis were analyzed for their relative expression by further quantitative real-time pcr. the objective of this study was to provide a comprehensive molecular biology insight into the cuticular wax deposition in p. pratensis and to identify genes which are likely to be involved in wax deposition in p. pratensis leaves.

RESULTS
leaf cuticular wax
leaf three of p. pratensis was divided into mixed sample of non-elongation zone and elongation zone  and emerged blade zone  according to their positions . the nezm was covered by sheath whereas the ebz was fully expanded and exposed under air. cuticular wax differentially deposited on the leaf zones of p. pratensis. scanning electron microscope analysis showed that there was less wax crystalloids in nezm than ebz . the amount of total cuticular wax on ebz was about three times than that in nezm . in grasses, leaf cells divide and expand within the sheaths of older leaves, where the micro-environment differs from the open atmosphere. by the time epidermal cells are displaced into the atmosphere, they must have a functional cuticle to minimize uncontrolled water loss.fig.  <dig> leaf cuticular wax in non elongation zone  and emerged blade zone  of poa pratensis. a scheme of leaf regions which were analyzed by transcriptome sequencing and qrt-pcr; b wax crystal structure; c amount of total cuticular wax

using the trinity de novo assembly program  <cit> , short read sequences were assembled into  <dig> , <dig> contigs, of which there were  <dig>  contigs coding for transcripts longer than 1 kb and  <dig> contigs coding for transcripts longer than 2 kb. the contigs were subsequently subjected to cluster and assembly analysis. a total of  <dig>  unigenes with n <dig> length of 1042 bp and mean length of  <dig>  bp were obtained, among which  <dig>  genes  were greater than 1 kb. an overview of the assembled contigs, transcripts and unigenes was presented in table  <dig>  these results demonstrated the effectiveness of illumina pyrosequencing in rapidly capturing a large portion of the transcriptome.table  <dig> summary of iiiumina transcriptome assembly for poa pratensis




since there was no reference genome sequence for p. pratensis, the de novo assembled transcriptome sequence by trinity was regarded as a reference sequence. bowtie software  <cit>  was used to map all the clean reads to the de novo assembly transcriptome reference sequences and to qualify transcriptome by assigning to unigenes with the rsem  software  <cit> . the  <dig> , <dig> clean reads  were successfully realigned to the reference sequence, showing that the quality of these assembled unigenes was sufficient to conduct the following analysis. sequencing randomness and sequencing saturation assessment also demonstrated rna integrity at transcript level .

furthermore,  <dig>  unigenes were found to have predicted orf by using the software getorf . the predicted orfs ranged from 57 bp to  <dig>  bp in length and n <dig> is 753 bp. the length distribution of the predicted orfs was shown in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> length distribution of poa pratensis unigene orf. the y-axis indicates the number of unigene orf, and the x-axis indicates the length of unigene orf. of the  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>  unigenes were found to have predicted orf by using the software getorf. the minimum length was 57 bp and the maximum length was  <dig>  bp. the largest number of orf was in the range of 0–300 bp



frequency and distribution of ssrs in the p. pratensis leaf transcripts
ssrs markers are the most important molecular markers in plants and have been proven to be a valuable tool for various applications in genetics and plant breeding. in this study,  <dig>  unigenes  were used to determine potential microsatellite motifs using microsatellite  software . in total  <dig> ssrs were identified in leaf samples . tri-nucleotide repeats  were the most abundant ssr motif in leaf tissues followed by mono-nucleotide , di-nucleotide , tetra-nucleotide , penta-nucleotide , and hexa-nucleotide  motifs. the number of compound ssrs and uncertain compound ssrs were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.table  <dig> frequency of ssrs in poa pratensis

analysis of differentially expressed genes 
the transcript abundance of each unigene was estimated by reads per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads . using software deseq  <cit>  and fdr ≤  <dig>  and ǀlog2fcǀ ≥  <dig> as the criteria,  <dig> unigenes showed significant differences in expression between the nezm and the ebz , including both  <dig> up-regulated unigenes and  <dig> down-regulated unigenes in the ebz library compared to those in the nezm library.fig.  <dig> volcano plot of differentially expressed genes. for the x-axis, the farther away from  <dig>  the greater the difference of gene expression between the nezm and ebz. for the y-axis, the greater the value, the smaller the false positive rate, the more reliable the differentially expressed genes screened. fc: fold change; fdr: false discovery rate; false : insignificance; true : significance



functional annotation
for the validation and annotation of the assembled unigenes, all the assembled unigenes were searched against the ncbi non-redundant , swissprot, gene ontology , clusters of orthologous groups , and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  databases using blast program with an e-value threshold of 10- <dig>  among  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>   and  <dig>   unigenes had significant matches in the nr and swiss-prot database, respectively . furthermore, go, cog and kegg annotations were applicable for  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  % of unigenes, respectively.table  <dig> functional annotation of the unigenes from poa pratensis




there were  <dig> degs annotated in nr database, among which  <dig> degs were assigned with one or more go terms . in the biological process category,  <dig> degs were classified into  <dig> go classes, and “metabolic process” and “cellular process” were the most represented go terms. in the cellular component category and the molecular function category,  <dig> and  <dig> degs fell into  <dig> go classes, respectively. “cell part”, “cell” and “organelle” were the most common terms in the cellular component category. regarding molecular function, unigenes with binding and catalytic activity were highly represented . different enrichment trends between all unigenes and deg unigenes were mainly observed in “extracellular matrix”, “extracellular region” and “membrane-enclosed lumen” in the cellular component category, “nutrient reservoir activity”, “antioxidant activity” and “protein binding transcription factor activity” in the molecular function category, and “cell prolifereation” and “pigmentation” in the biological process category, respectively .fig.  <dig> histogram presentation of gene ontology classification. the results are summarized in three main categories, cellular component, molecular function, and biological process. the left y-axis indicates the percentage of genes in a category, and the right y-axis indicates the number of genes in a category



deg unigenes were also subjected to a search against the cog database for functional prediction and classification. finally,  <dig> degs could be assigned to cog classifications . cog annotated putative proteins were functionally classified into at least  <dig> protein families involved in lipid transport and metabolism, transcription, signal transduction mechanisms, and so on. the cluster for general function prediction  represented the largest group, followed by replication, recombination and repair , transcription , and signal transduction mechanisms .fig.  <dig> histogram presentation of the cog classification of the differentially expression genes between leaf non-elongation zone and the emerged blade zone. in total,  <dig> degs showing significant homology to the cogs database were grouped into at least  <dig> categories. the capital letters in x-axis indicate the cog categories as listed on the right and the y-axis indicates the number of degs in each category



to further analyze degs between leaf nezm and the ebz, all the deg unigenes were analyzed in kegg pathway database. as a result,  <dig> degs were found to have significant matches in the database and were assigned to  <dig> kegg pathways . the top  <dig> kegg pathways with the most significant enrichment were shown in fig.  <dig>  it was also observed that there were  <dig> degs encoding enzymes that were involved in fatty acid biosynthesis.fig.  <dig> scatter diagram of kegg pathway enrichment of differentially expressed genes between leaf non-elongation zone and the emerged blade zone. enrichment factor indicates the ratio of degs per pathway to all unigenes annotated in the pathway. q-value is defined as an analog of the p-value that incorporates fdr-based multiple testing correction



differentially expressed genes involved in wax biosynthesis in p. pratensis
to identify the genes likely involved in wax biosynthesis in p. pratensis, we constructed a candidate fatty acid and wax deposition related gene set from down-regulated unigenes in the ebz  compared to the nezm  based on the go, cog, kegg, swissprot, and nr annotation . the selected unigene id and annotation were listed in additional file 2: table s <dig>  three enzymes related to very-long-chain-fatty acid biosynthesis and six enzymes and proteins related to cuticular wax biosynthesis, secretion and regulation were identified. putative proteins involved in defense response were also found . in the most cases, more than one unigenes were assigned to the same enzyme or protein. such unigenes might represent different fragments of a single transcript, different members of a gene family, or both.

quantitative real-time-pcr validation of the candidate degs involved in wax biosynthesis
to validate the responsible genes in the candidate gene set involved in wax deposition, twelve unigenes from the above set were selected and detected their expression profile between the nezm and the ebz by qrt-pcr. the results showed that twelve unigenes significantly up-regulated in the nezm compared to the ebz , which were in consistent with the transcriptome data.fig.  <dig> validation of selected twelve up-regulated transcripts in the non-elongation zone as compared to the emerged blade zone involved in wax biosynthesis by qrt-pcr. ebz and nezm represent the emerged blade zone and the non-elongation zone, respectively. the relative gene expression levels as expressed by 2-ΔΔct were determined separately for each treatment as the mean ± se. asterisks indicate levels of significance of differential expression 



discussion
transcriptome sequencing is widely applied in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation analysis of genes and global expression pattern analysis of complex genomes. in this study, a comparative de novo transcriptome analysis of leaf nezm versus ebz was conducted and  <dig> , <dig> reads with a total of  <dig> , <dig>  bp  were generated by illumina hiseq  <dig> paired-end sequencing. for plants without a genomic sequence, such short reads can be effectively assembled through the improvement of read length by the paired-end sequencing and the using of trinity  <cit> . in total,  <dig> ,387 bp contigs,  <dig>  bp transcripts and  <dig>  bp unigenes were obtained in p. pratensis, respectively.

it was previously reported that wax deposition in barley started to be synthesized from the leaf nez wrapped by sheath  <cit> . in this study, transcript levels from the leaf nezm and the ebz were compared to obtain a list of significantly differentially expressed unigenes. using deseq software, which is suitable for screening differentially expressed genes in samples with biological replicates, and fdr ≤  <dig>  and ǀlog2fcǀ ≥  <dig> as the criteria,  <dig>  unigenes showed significant differences in expression between the nezm and the ebz. this number of degs was far beyond normal differential range. considering the potential big difference between the two tissues and to increase the accuracy of the screening results, fdr ≤  <dig>  and ∣log2fc∣ ≥  <dig> was used as adjusted criteria and finally  <dig> degs were obtained. the functions of the degs by go annotations were mainly related to “extracellular matrix” and “extracellular region” in the cellular components, and “nutrient reservoir activity” in the molecular function category. these functions were in consistent with the vital importance of plant surface wax in protecting tissue from environmental stresses  <cit> . during cuticle deposition, a massive flux of lipids occurs from the sites of lipid synthesis in the plastid and the endoplasmic reticulum to the plant surface. the endoplasmic reticulum integrated with the membrane and plasmodesma in cellular components may play an important role in wax synthesis. furthermore, degs were also mainly annotated with “cell prolifereation”, attributing to different surface area expansion rates in nezm and ebz. this supports the phenomenon that leaf cells divide and expand within the sheaths of older leaves in grasses.

based on swissprot and nr annotation, several candidate genes involved in vlcfas and cuticular wax biosynthesis pathway were obtained, such as lacs, kcs, kcr, far, and cer <dig>  vlcfas, as both wax component and wax precursor, was catalyzed by the elongase complexes, including kcs, kcr, hcd, and ecr. kcs is the first and committing step in vlcfas biosynthesis and has broad substrate specificity  <cit> . alcohol-forming fatty acyl-coa reductase  and aldhydede carbonylase cer <dig> were identified catalyzing the production of primary alcohols and alkanes, respectively  <cit> . lacs catalyzed free long-chain fatty acids to coa  <cit> . in this study, lacs, kcs, kcr, far and cer <dig> were expressed predominantly in the nezm, the zone where significant wax deposition commences, supporting the previous results that younger shoot tissue was the active wax synthesis site  <cit> . in the developing barley leaf, wax deposition commences within the portion of the blade that is enclosed by sheaths of older leaves  <cit> . changes in the micro-environment of the leaf from the nezm to ebz might alter the expression of the unigenes. however, five unigenes  annotated as kcs and c <dig> graph_c <dig> annotated as kcr were expressed higher in the ebz compared to nezm, suggesting the functional differentiation of kcs and kcr gene family members. besides involving in cuticular wax synthesis, vlcfas were also related to other physiological function such as involving in membrane lipids and sphingolipids  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that only some kcs and kcr gene family members participate in wax production.

abc transporter family was ubiquitously associated with transport across membranes of a broad range of molecules in prokaryotes and eukaryotes  <cit> . in this study, putative abc transporter g, b and c families, and lipid transfer proteins  were significantly up-regulated in the nezm compared to ebz, indicating that these proteins might play an important role in p. pratensis wax secretion. it has been commonly proposed that abc transporter g family member and ltps were involved in wax trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane and wax extracellular transportation, respectively  <cit> .

the wax metabolic pathway is regulated by various transcription factors. one of these to be identified and characterized for its role in cuticle metabolism was shn1/win <dig>  a member of the a. thaliana ethylene-responsive ap2-domain transcription factor super family . in this study, putative ethylene-responsive transcription factor, including win1and wri <dig>  were expressed mainly in the nezm, which might activate wax deposition in younger tissue. the expression of win <dig> was also related to defense response of plant. the overexpression of slshn <dig>  an ortholog of the arabidopsis win/shn <dig>  increased tomato resistance to botrytis cinerea, whereas slshn3-rnai plants were more sensitive to b. cinerea compared to wild-type plants  <cit> . the altered defense responses in slshn3-overexpressing plants were correlated with the cuticle permeability and the activation of pathogenesis-related gene pr1a and aos  <cit> . several defense response related genes, including pr <dig>  were more expressed in nezm compared to ebz in this study, indicating that wax deposition might be linked with defense response. garbay et al.  <cit>  reported that the amount of pr1-mrna was not directly correlated to the amount of leaf epicuticular wax, but was rather correlated to the presence or absence of some particular lipid-constituents in the epicuticular wax layer  <cit> . other transcription factors characterized for its role in cuticle metabolism belonged to myb family. it is reported that myb <dig> could promote drought tolerance and trigger disease resistance response by inducing arabidopsis cuticular wax accumulation  <cit> . the overexpression of myb <dig> in arabidopsis stimulated the production of vlcfas and waxes  <cit> . in this study, although no myb <dig> and myb <dig> were identified, fourteen unigenes annotated with myb protein were found to have more expression in the nezm compared to the ebz, suggesting the potential role of myb family in wax metabolism regulation.

besides their primary role in stress response, cuticular waxes were also found to be involved in developmental processes, notably through tight connections with the epidermis morphology  <cit> . the more expression of epidermal patterning factor  in nezm than that in ebz supported the link between cuticular wax metabolism and the process of epidermal cell patterning . in addition, putative bhlh transcription factors were also up-regulated in the nezm . this was in agreement with the function of bhlh, which was important in development or cell activity.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a comparative transcriptome sequencing between leaf nezm and ebz in p. pratensis was performed using illumina platform. in total,  <dig> , <dig> clean reads were de novo assembled into  <dig>  unigenes. all unigenes were then evaluated and functionally annotated by comparing with the existing protein databases, including nr, swissprot, go, cog, and kegg database. several candidate genes potentially involved in cuticular wax biosynthesis, transportation, regulation, development, and defense response, were identified. about  <dig> ssr molecular markers were developed. the database will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanism of cuticular wax deposition in p. pratensis leaf and will provide the fundamental genetic resources in improving plant adaptation to abiotic and biotic stresses.
