BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small rnas  found in plants, animals, viruses and at least one unicellular organism   <cit> . they function by binding to target sites in 3'' utrs of messenger rnas  to repress translation or mediate mrna degradation, although alternative modes of action have been reported recently, such as direct transcriptional silencing of polr3d by mir- <dig>  <cit> . in animals, the majority of mature mirnas are synthesized in two processing steps: first, the primary mirna transcript  is cut by the nuclear rnase iii enzyme drosha and its cofactor dgcr <dig> in the nucleus, generating precursor mirnas . these are subsequently exported to the cytoplasm via the nuclear transport receptor exportin- <dig> and the co-factor rangtp, where they are cleaved by the rnase iii enzyme dicer into a double stranded rna of ~22nt. the strand with the less stable 5'' hydrogen bonding is usually selected as the mature mirna, although both strands can be functional. it is assumed that the pri-mirnas of most intergenic mirnas are transcribed independently by rna polymerase ii   <cit> , while most intragenic mirnas are co-transcribed with their host genes. given the similarity with class ii protein-coding genes, their expression may be controlled through a variety of shared regulation pathways. however, few pri-mirnas have been characterized experimentally to date  <cit> , making the localization of their promoters challenging and one of the prime reasons we are only beginning to understand the mechanism by which their expression is regulated. recently, several studies attempted to predict the primary transcripts of pri-mirnas by exploring transcription factor binding sites , expressed sequence tags , transcription start site  predictions, and further, complementary genomic data  <cit> . based on these studies, the length of pri-mirnas was estimated to range from several hundred to several thousand nucleotides. these studies are useful references to estimate the scale of pri-mirnas as well as the location of their promoter, in order to investigate mirna transcriptional regulation.

mirnas can be expressed in a tissue- and stage-specific manner during development and that they can play key roles in lineage decisions of progenitor cells and organogenesis . enhancer-mediated long-range regulation is an important mechanism for controlling gene expression during development and has recently been shown to affect mirnas as well  <cit> . many of these enhancers are highly conserved non-coding elements  that collaboratively regulate the specific expression of their respective target genes  <cit> . it has previously been demonstrated that both hcnes and their target genes are preserved within synteny blocks in vertebrates and insects during evolution, which has served as the foundation for the concept of the "genomic regulatory block" . grbs are functional regulatory units that consist of hcnes, genes regulated by hcnes  as well as "unrelated" genes . both hcnes and target genes have coevolved in order to maintain their functional association, while bystander genes can be lost through the time.

further investigation of the general transcriptional initiation properties of genes in grbs has shown that the promoters of grb target genes share common features that can be used to distinguish them from the promoters of bystander genes, which are genes that may be close to, or even harbor, hcnes but are not under their regulation. target genes are generally associated with long cpg islands  that are not limited to the 5' end of the genes, but also occur in introns or internal exons of the gene  <cit>  and coincide with genomic regions bound by repressor polycomb group proteins  <cit> . in addition, they have a higher number and wider spacing of alternative tsss, and a distinct composition of tfbss in their core/proximal promoters  <cit> . furthermore, many target gene promoters belong to the class of "bivalent promoters" that display a distinct pattern of both activating and repressing histone modifications in embryonic stem  cell lines  <cit> , which may allow them to be turned on or off quickly during organogenesis  <cit> . the analysis of the mir- <dig> mirna family members  dre-mir-9-1) in zebrafish has shown that they are regulated by the same type of enhancers as protein-coding grb target genes  <cit> . these mirna target genes are both embedded in areas of conserved synteny throughout vertebrates and co-localize with a number of hcnes that function as long-range enhancers controlling their expression. as a result, they show highly stage- and tissue-specific expression in dorsal telencephalon at  <dig> h post fertilization, while the expression pattern of the neighboring bystander genes is far less specific. the inspection of other mirnas in the ancora genome browser  <cit>  clearly reveals further examples of mirnas that fall within regions of high hcne density, such as hsa-mir-124- <dig>  indicating that this type of regulation may be prevalent.

based on their functional similarity and the common transcriptional mechanisms they employ, we hypothesize that mirnas with complex spatiotemporal expression patterns may be regulated in the same manner as protein-coding grb target genes and that they share the following genomic properties:

- a genomic neighborhood with a high hcne density

- a bivalent promoter  <cit>  during development and differentiation

- large cgis spanning both the promoter and the gene body

in our work we show that both a subset of conserved self-transcribed mirnas  as well as a set of experimentally validated grb target mirnas  <cit>  demonstrate these properties. but our ability to use these features for predicting novel grb target mirnas was limited, since more than half of the st mirnas in our dataset do not have primary transcript predictions and we were therefore not able to accurately compute cpg island-related features for them. as a result, we used an elevated hcne density in the genomic vicinity as well as the presence of a bivalent promoter to then identify  <dig> putative grb target mirnas/mirna clusters, over two-thirds of which are known to play a role during development and differentiation. furthermore these predictions include mirnas of the mir- <dig> family, which are the only experimentally verified grb target mirna genes.

RESULTS
defining self-transcribed mirnas and the extent of their pri-mrnas
based on the assumption that some mirnas have co-evolved with their cis-acting regulatory elements, in this study, we focused on conserved human self-transcribed mirnas , which are assumed to be transcribed from their own promoters and have an ortholog in at least one other vertebrate species . these requirements are consistent with the work describing the original definition of a grb  <cit>  as well as the subsequent analysis of the features of grb target genes  <cit> . in general, st mirnas include all conserved human intergenic mirnas except those transcribed by rna polymerase iii   <cit> , as well as known cases of intronic mirnas whose fate after whole-genome duplication in fish indicates that they have their own promoters, independent of their host genes .

since proximal mirnas can appear in genomic clusters that share the same promoter and are transcribed as a single transcript, we clustered st mirnas according to their genomic vicinity  and analyzed only one promoter per cluster,

the annotation of the pri-mirnas we used in this study was the result of a combinatorial approach by saini et al.  <cit>  that employed predicted and experimental evidence to identify both transcription start and end sites. one of the most important reasons for choosing this dataset was the fact that they considered a larger range of possible mirna sizes, thereby avoiding biases introduced by excluding very long transcripts. we estimated the general scale of pri-mirnas based on these data, where the tss is within  <dig> kb upstream of pre-mirnas and the transcription end is within  <dig> kb downstream of the pre-mirnas. this approach was sensitive enough to include around 84% of the pri-mirnas in the initial dataset .

enhancer density
hcnes
hcnes represent putative enhancers of gene expression, whose frequency rises strongly around the conserved developmental genes they usually target  <cit> . we therefore first investigated whether this applied to conserved st mirnas as well, by comparing the hcne density in a  <dig> kb window centered on the st mirna with random coding and non-coding genomic regions with similar gene density . in a few cases , the location of the st mirna search window overlapped with a previously defined grb making it difficult to identify the actual target gene, which could either be the mirna, the annotated grb target gene, or both. for this reason, we compared the hcne densities both including and excluding cases in which the st mirna search window overlapped with a previously defined grb. as shown in table  <dig>  the hcne density was significantly higher around st mirnas than the random coding and non-coding regions in both comparisons, a trend that is independent of the lineages compared . thus, in support of our original hypothesis, we can conclude that hcnes are highly over-represented in the genomic vicinity of conserved human st mirnas. the hcne density was also compared between the conserved st mirnas and the grb target genes annotated in akalin et al.  <cit> . we found that the hcne density was significantly lower for the st mirnas . this is due to the fact that the grb target genes were annotated based on their high hcne density  <cit> , which was not a prerequisite for constructing our dataset of st mirnas.

the comparisons represented by each column were performed after selecting hcnes and st mirnas conserved between the lineages shown in the left column . the p-values were computed using the two-sided bootstrapped version of the kolmogorov-smirnov test. all p-values lower than  <dig> e- <dig> were set to  <dig> 

experimentally verified enhancers
in addition to hcnes, we utilized experimental data describing the location of the transcriptional co-activator p <dig> to analyze the enhancer density around st mirnas. this transcription factor is a ubiquitous component of enhancer-associated protein assemblies. it co-localizes with active enhancers and plays a critical role during embryonic development  <cit> . visel et al.  <cit>  mapped the genome-wide binding of p <dig> in forebrain, midbrain and limb tissue of developing mouse embryos using chip-seq technology. this generated ~ <dig> p <dig> binding regions which are associated with active enhancers. since conservation criteria did not play a role in determining these p <dig> binding regions, they represent a dataset of experimentally verified enhancers that is completely independent of the hcnes, allowing us to test our hypothesis in an unbiased manner. we then compared the p <dig> binding density around st mirnas that are conserved between mouse and human  with that of mouse coding and non-coding regions using the same method as the previous hcne density analysis and found that the density of p <dig> binding sites around mouse:human st mirnas was indeed significantly higher than in the control sets  .

these results are independent of hcne density, since the same trend was still present when we performed the analysis excluding p <dig> binding sites that overlap with mouse orthologs of our hcnes  .

comparison between enhancer enriched and enhancer poor st mirnas
as the density of hcnes/p <dig> binding around conserved st mirnas is significantly higher than in random non-coding and protein coding regions and there are conserved st mirnas that are known developmental regulators similar to grb target genes, we wanted to see whether there was an association between the individual features of grb target genes and hcne/p <dig> densities. we again limited the analysis to st mirnas conserved between human and mouse in order to be able to incorporate the p <dig> binding data.

we then compared the features of grb target genes between the hcne/p <dig> enriched and hcne/p <dig> poor mirnas excluding intragenic st mirnas due to the uncertainty in associating genomic features with the st mirna or the host gene.

identification and analysis of bivalent st mirna promoters
the genome-wide mapping of chromatin states by detection of histone marks revealed regions carrying both the h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> histone modifications. although these so-called bivalent domains  <cit>  are rare within the genome, they are over-represented at the promoters of key developmental genes  in embryonic stem cells  <cit>  and were suggested to mediate activation and repression of expression of the genes during lineage commitment by maintaining genes in a poised status  <cit> . furthermore, bivalent promoters represent useful marks for the annotation of both protein-coding and mirna grb target genes, since around 70% of them had a bivalent promoter in mouse es cells, compared to only 13% of the bystander genes  <cit> , and the expression of several lineage-specific mirnas is correlated with the presence of this mark at their promoters  <cit> .

both human  <cit>  and mouse bivalent domains  <cit>  were subsequently mapped to the putative promoter regions of hcne enriched/poor st mirnas and p <dig> enriched/poor st mirnas, respectively . we found that 24%  of the hcne enriched st mirnas are associated with bivalent domains within  <dig> kb upstream in human es cells, compared to only 8%  of hcne poor st mirnas . however, bivalent domains are less likely to be associated with p <dig> enriched st mirnas compared to those of p <dig> poor st mirnas . this difference could be explained by the fact that the data on histone modifications and p <dig> binding are from different tissues/developmental stages, since the histone modification data are from v <dig>  es cells, hybrid es cells, neural progenitor cells  and primary embryonic fibroblasts  obtained at embryonic day   <dig>   <cit> , while the p <dig> data is from embryonic forebrain, midbrain and limb tissue of mouse embryos at e  <dig>   <cit> . as enhancers and histone modifications are both tissue- and stage-specific, it is possible that the p <dig> data and bivalent domains we used in the analysis regulate transcription in distinct developmental contexts. furthermore, the bivalent promoters are associated with promoters "poised" for transcription  <cit>  while the p <dig> marks of active enhancers are expected to co-occur with actively transcribed target genes  <cit> , so they are unlikely to co-occur in the same tissue/stage for a given gene. fortunately, the detection of hcnes does not rely on tissue or developmental stages, but instead is able to detect putative enhancers in all tissues from all stages. therefore, the analysis of hcne enriched/poor st mirnas is stage/tissue-independent and thus less likely to be biased. for this reason, in the following analysis we only compared features between hcne enriched and hcne poor st mirnas.

analysis of cpg islands associated with st mirnas
grb target genes are often associated with higher ratios between cgi length and transcript length , and the overlapping cgis map not only to the promoter, as in most other genes, but also introns, internal exons, and in some cases, even cover the entire target gene  <cit> . it was shown recently that some of these cgis coincide within genomic regions bound by repressive polycomb group proteins   <cit> . a recent study also found that  <dig> human mirnas co-localized with multiple cgis within their  <dig> kb flanking regions, and that  <dig> pre-mirnas were completely embedded in cgis  <cit> . in addition, juan et al.  <cit>  showed that the expression of mir-199/ <dig> might be regulated by pcg-proteins during skeletal muscle cell differentiation. in another example shown by wang et al. mir- <dig> is repressed by nf-kappab acting through yy <dig> and the pcg-proteins  <cit> . based on these findings, we compared the cpg-to-gene ratio associated with hcne enriched and hcne poor st mirnas as well as the gene sets used in the previous grb target gene study by akalin et al  <cit>  .

the results show that the cpg-to-gene ratio of the hcne enriched st mirnas is significantly higher than those of bystander, transcription factor and cgi-associated genes, while there is no significant difference in the comparison with the grb target genes . furthermore, we find no significant differences in the cpg-to-gene ratios between hcne poor st mirnas and bystander genes or other transcription factors. in addition, the cpg-to-gene ratios of hcne poor st mirnas is significantly lower when compared to grb target genes/other cgi genes. this indicates that the distribution of cpg-to-gene ratios of hcne enriched st mirnas is more similar to grb target genes than that of hcne poor st mirnas. however, we did not find significant differences in the cpg-to-gene ratios between hcne enriched st mirnas and hcne poor st mirnas, which could be explained by the small sample size. nevertheless, there is still a common trend showing that hcne enriched st mirnas have higher cpg-to-gene ratios than hcne poor st mirnas, since their median cpg-to-gene ratio is fivefold higher .

significant differences in the median cpg-to-gene ratio between the gene sets were determined using the two-sided bootstrapped version of the kolmogorov-smirnov test. significant p-values  are shown in bold. the first row indicates the median cpg-to-gene ratio for each gene set and the second and third rows contain the p-values of the comparisons between the cpg-to-gene ratios of the hcne enriched or hcne poor st mirnas and other control gene sets.

grb target gene features can identify st mirnas subject to long-range regulation
the mir- <dig> family of mirnas is a known, experimentally verified grb target  <cit>  and therefore a prime example for illustrating how the genomic features we analyzed could serve to annotate mirnas under long-range regulation. this family is specifically expressed in brain and affects the fate of es cell-derived neural precursor cells differentiating along the glial or neuronal pathways  <cit> . the expression of the mir- <dig> family of genes is dynamically regulated  <cit>  during differentiation and development, and the human mir- <dig> family has three members: hsa-mir-9- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  in the human genome, hsa-mir-9- <dig> and hsa-mir-9- <dig> are intergenic mirnas, and hsa-mir-9- <dig> is found in the second intron of c1orf <dig>  since the zebrafish ortholog of hsa-mir-9- <dig> is located in an intergenic region, it qualifies as a st mirna based on our definition. moreover, hsa-mir-9- <dig> and hsa-mir-9- <dig> are paralogs that were most likely separated by the whole-genome duplication at the root of jawed vertebrates  <cit> , which suggests that their common ancestor was intronic, but that the host gene is not required for their transcription  <cit> . therefore, all mir- <dig> family members can be classified as st mirnas and are likely to have their own promoters. a detailed examination of their genomic environments showed that all of them share the features of grb target genes , since they map to genomic regions with high hcne densities, the putative promoters of their mouse orthologs map to bivalent domains and they are all associated with several proximal cgis.

we further examined the annotation of each gene within the investigated region around the mirnas. since there is no other putative grb target gene within the region of hsa-mir-9- <dig>  we conclude that hsa-mir-9- <dig> is most likely the only target of long-range enhancers in that region. in the neighborhood of hsa-mir-9- <dig> and hsa-mir-9- <dig>  we find myocyte enhancer factors mef2d and mef2c, respectively. both of these genes are transcription factors that play a role in myogenesis and are therefore plausible grb target gene candidates. however, it was shown that two regions with enhancer activity located ~ <dig> kb downstream of dre-mir-9- <dig>  the zebrafish ortholog of hsa-mir-9- <dig>  and ~ <dig> kb downstream of dre-mir-9- <dig>  the zebrafish ortholog of hsa-mir-9- <dig>  gave the reporter gene an expression pattern similar to that of zebrafish mir- <dig>  but not the zebrafish myocyte enhancer factors  <cit> . thus, it may very well be that both mirnas and the myocyte enhancer factors are regulated by distinct elements in the regions, and that there is a boundary between the two, similar to that of neighboring grbs targeting pax <dig> and wt <dig> genes  <cit> . in summary, the genomic features of regions around members of the mir- <dig> family display characteristics equivalent to those of protein-coding grb target genes, lending further support to the use of these features for predicting novel mirna targets of long-range regulation.

genome-wide identification of putative grb target mirnas
taken together, the results of our analyses show that hcne enriched st mirna genes are more likely to be associated with the features of grb target genes than hcne poor st mirna genes, which leads us to believe that we can utilize them for the prediction of grb target mirnas.

in order to identify grb target mirna genes on a genome-wide scale, we selected all hcne enriched st mirna genes across different lineage comparisons, which were associated with bivalent domains in at least one developmental cell type . our predictions included  <dig> st mirna genes/mirna gene clusters,  <dig> of which have known functions in development  as well as the mir- <dig> family, which are the validated grb target mirnas. we did not use cgi-related features in the prediction process, since most of the st mirnas in our dataset do not have primary transcript predictions. we were therefore unable to accurately assign cgis to them. nevertheless, the majority of them are associated with at least one cgi within the estimated pri-mirnas .

CONCLUSIONS
while it has previously been demonstrated that a subset of mirna genes are under the same type of extreme long-range transcriptional regulation typical for developmental transcription factors  <cit> , we were now able to identify further putative grb target mirnas on a genome-wide scale based on the same characteristics defining protein-coding grb target genes. these features are their localizations in regions with a high hcne density and the fact that many of them have "bivalent" promoters before or during differentiation.

furthermore, the majority of our predictions is known to play a role during development and is associated with one or more cgis that are distributed along the mirna primary transcript, indicating that these st mirnas may be subject to the same type of polycomb-mediated repression seen in protein coding developmental genes.

our results provide an important new resource for the analysis of mirna regulation and greatly increase the number of mirna genes under putative long-range transcriptional control, indicating that many mirnas are subject to strict regulatory constraints whenever they are required to establish complex spatiotemporal developmental patterns.
