BACKGROUND
since the late tertiary period, severe climatic change and major geological events have played important roles in driving species diversity and in shaping the biogeographic distribution of extant organisms. benefiting from the development of dna technology and molecular analysis methods, studies of fungal molecular phylogeny and biogeography have been conducted in recent decades . based on molecular dating, many phylogenetic studies have revealed striking chronological and geographical correlations between evolutionary divergence and geological events .


laetiporus murrill  is a cosmopolitan genus, typified by l. sulphureus  murrill  <cit> . species in this genus grow from cold temperate to tropical zones and are associated with betulaceae, burseraceae, elaeocarpaceae, fabaceae, fagaceae, meliaceae, myrtaceae, oleaceae, pinaceae, salicaceae, sapindaceae and taxaceae . laetiporus spp. have been considered to be forest pathogens and to cause brown cubical heart rot  <cit> , which is implicated in the cycle of the forest ecosystem  <cit> . chemical composition research determined that this cultivable mushroom is a potential food due to its rich digestible bioactive substances and lack of detectable levels of poisonous microelements  <cit> . some taxa of laetiporus are also valuable sources of medicine, such as ergosterol and acetyl eburicoic acid  <cit> .

recently, several studies were carried out to clarify the species diversity and phylogeny of laetiporus . in these studies, six new species were described, and four new lineages were identified: clade i, clade h, clade l and clade m. in addition, l. sulphureus and l. versisporus  imazeki were shown to each be divisible into three different lineages , which are represented here as clade c, clade e1/e <dig> and clade g1/g2/g <dig>  respectively.

to date, eleven species and four undescribed taxa of laetiporus have been accepted as belonging to this genus  <cit> : l. ailaoshanensis b.k. cui & j. song, l. cremeiporus y. ota & t. hatt., l. versisporus and l. zonatus b.k. cui & j. song from east asia; l. cincinnatus  burds., banik & t.j. volk, l. conifericola burds. & banik and l. huroniensis burds. & banik from north america; l. caribensis banik & d.l. lindner from central america; l. montanus Černý ex tomšovský & jankovský from east asia and europe; l. sulphureus from north america, south america and europe; l. gilbertsonii burds. from pan-america; l. sp.  <dig> from hawaii; l. sp.  <dig> from south america; l. sp.  <dig> and l. sp.  <dig> from central america . however, the interspecies relationships within laetiporus, as well as the origin and biogeography of the genus, remain unclear.

here, we present multi-locus phylogenetic analyses using sequences from the internal transcribed spacer , nuclear large subunit rdna , nuclear small subunit rdna , translation elongation factor 1-α , dna-directed rna polymerase ii subunit  <dig> , and mitochondrial small subunit rdna  to gain insight into the evolution of species in laetiporus. our study sought to  explore the evolutionary relationships between laetiporus species, and  estimate the divergence time and examine hypotheses about the origin and biogeography of laetiporus species.

the combined dataset and its dataset inferred similar topologies . the genus laetiporus was supported with low levels of support on the stem branches. moreover,  <dig> different phylogenetic lineages were inferred and significantly supported by both datasets.

in the combined dataset topology , l. sulphureus was divided into three different well-supported clades: clade c  and clade e <dig>  with yellow pore surfaces and clade e <dig>  with a white pore surface. l. versisporus was also divided into three different clades: clade g <dig> , clade g <dig> and clade g <dig> . three sister lineages  that grow on coniferous trees were well supported . two novel phylogenetic species from western china formed two significantly supported terminal lineages and were named clade p  and clade q . moreover, four groups were recognized . group i is well supported by bayesian inference   and moderately supported by mp and ml analyses , it is composed of two cold-temperate to subtropical laetiporus species with white pore surfaces. group ii is well supported by bi  but weakly supported by mp and ml analyses, and it contains four north american, central american and south american laetiporus species. group iii was well supported by bi , moderately supported by ml analysis  and includes four laetiporus species with a disjunct distribution from hengduan-himalayan zones to south africa. group iv was supported by mp and ml analyses  and only includes the east asian species l. versisporus with a yellow pore surface.

the its dataset  inferred a similar topology despite some existing differences. clade e <dig> and clade e <dig> clustered together and formed a novel group  with moderate support from mp and ml analyses  and weak support from bi. notably, this group was weakly supported by bi, mp and ml in the analyses using the combined dataset. the novel phylogenetic species clade q clustered together with clade c and formed a novel group  supported by mp and ml analyses  but only weakly supported by bi. moreover, of the  <dig> lineages identified in the phylogeny,  <dig> lineages  have temperate distribution,  <dig> lineages  have subtropical distribution and  <dig> lineages  have tropical distribution .

bayesian estimation of divergence time and the historical biogeography of laetiporus
the alignment of the two concatenated datasets , which were  <dig> and 1137 bp in length, respectively, consisted of  <dig> taxa. the aligned its dataset was 514 bp in length and was established to estimate the divergence time and biogeographical history of laetiporus.

analyses were calibrated using two methods. first, based on the divergence between ascomycota and basidiomycota, at  <dig> million years ago , paleopyrenomycites devonicus taylor, hass, kerp, m. krings & hanlin  was used to estimate the divergence time of polyporales at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya ), which is consistent with a previous inference  <cit> . the initial diversification of laetiporus occurred during the early miocene,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya , similar to the date of the diversification of the main laetiporus host plants, such as quercus, salix, populus, abies, picea and pinus . based on the second calibration point, quatsinoporites cranhamii s.y. sm., currah & stockey, the divergence between ascomycota and basidiomycota was estimated to have occurred at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya , which was much more recent than the minimal divergence age of the ascomycota/basidiomycota . meanwhile, the crown age of laetiporus estimated based on the calibration point was approximately  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mya , which was also significantly more recent than is required for the estimated divergence time of the main host plants. thus, the second calibration point seemed to vastly underestimate the divergence time of laetiporus. therefore, the first calibration point was used for subsequent analyses, and the divergence times of the main nodes are showed in fig.  <dig> and summarized in additional file 1: table s <dig> fig.  <dig> chronogram and estimated divergence times of laetiporus generated from molecular clock analysis using the its + nrlsu + nrssu and ef-1α + rpb <dig> datasets. a chronogram obtained using the ascomycota–basidiomycota divergence time of  <dig> mya as the calibration point is shown. the calibration point and objects of this study are marked in the chronogram. the lineages in the polyporales are highlighted in green. the geological time scale is in millions of years ago 




the inferred historical biogeographic scenarios from analyses using rasp are shown in fig.  <dig>  the divergence times of the main groups based on the its dating analysis are also showed in fig.  <dig> and summarized in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the results of the dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis  analysis suggest a complex biogeographic history for laetiporus. fifteen dispersal events and six vicariance events were necessary to explain the current distribution of the genus. the ancestral area of laetiporus was ambiguous. in the reconstruction of their ancestral geographic range, several areas contribute to the geography in different proportions: the probability for east asia and north america was 48%, that for europe and north america was 42%, and that for north america was 10%. thus, the geographic range of east asia and north america had the highest probability  of being the ancestral area. the most probable  ancestral area for group i was east asia and north america. the most probable  ancestral area for group ii was north america and central america. east asia was the most probable ancestral area for group iii and group iv, at 72% and 85%, respectively. the most probable  ancestral area for group v was north america. the most probable  ancestral area for group vi was east asia. furthermore, four dispersal routes and a possible concealed dispersal route were inferred: east asia–eastern north america, north america–central america–south america, east asia–south africa, east asia–europe and east asia–malay archipelago–australia–hawaii .fig.  <dig> divergence time estimation and ancestral area reconstruction of laetiporus using the its dataset. the chronogram was obtained via molecular clock analysis using beast. a pie chart at each node indicates the possible ancestral distributions inferred from dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis  analysis implemented in rasp. a black asterisk represents other ancestral ranges

discussion

laetiporus has been shown to be a monophyletic group . unexpectedly, despite conducting multi-locus phylogenetic analyses, our study is still unable to entirely resolve the stem relationships within laetiporus. nevertheless, novel phylogenetic species and certain clustering tendencies are described. findings regarding the origin, ancestral area and diversification are also inferred.

group i contains two sister clades, clade d and clade k, with disjunct distribution . phylogenetically, this group is supported by the combined dataset analyses . however, clade d and clade k are distant in the its topology. previous studies showed that both species grow on hardwood with the common cool temperate to subtropical habitat, producing an orange pileal surface and cream pore surface . the complete gene information, as well as a similar growth habit and morphology between clade d and clade k, suggests that the phylogeny inferred from the analyses of the combined dataset is more reliable.

group ii consists of four north/central/south american laetiporus clades . within this group, clade f is known to reside in temperate to tropical areas with a pan-american distribution  <cit> . this distribution indicates a strong adaptive ability. the other three members of laetiporus that behave as sister species are known to reside only in central america  <cit> , which is part of the mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot  <cit> . species in this group are found on hardwood and share an orange pileal surface and yellow pore surface, although the characters of clade l and clade m are uncertain  <cit> . notably, their host plants are usually fagaceae in north america, tropical plants such as guarea and dacryodes in central america and mainly eucalyptus in south america  <cit> .

group iii contains four laetiporus clades from east asia and south africa, including the novel phylogenetic species clade p . clade p is found on abies in cool temperate areas in the himalayan region. it acts as a sister species with l. ailaoshanensis , which has been found on lithocarpus and castanopsis in subtropical areas in the hengduan mountains  <cit> . clade o is the other species collected from the hengduan mountains, and it grows on quercus in temperate areas  <cit> . clade h is found on eucalyptus from south africa, but its characters remain unclear  <cit> . the relationships between clade h and the other three species are uncertain due to the low support in the topology of the combined dataset . further studies using samples from south africa are necessary.

group iv consists of only l. versisporus , which has a yellow pore surface . previous studies have shown that this species is usually divided into two or three clades  <cit> . in the current study, l. versisporus specimens grouped together with significant support from mp and ml analyses. l. versisporus covers most parts of east asia from the yunnan-guizhou plateau, hainan to japan and south korea, and associate with robinia, castanea, quercus, elaeocarpus and castanopsis  <cit> . infraspecific variation and infraspecific hybridization are considered to occur simultaneously  <cit> .

group v consists of clade e <dig> and clade e <dig> . it is obvious that they are closely related and share similar morphology except for the pore surface  <cit> . clade e <dig> is associated with quercus, eucalyptus, salix, acer and fraxinus and has a disjunct temperate to subtropical areas distribution in north america, south america and europe. besides, it produces a yellow pore surface  <cit> . clade e <dig> is distributed in temperate areas of north america, is associated with quercus and fraxinus, and produces a white pore surface  <cit> .

group vi consists of clade c and the novel phylogenetic species clade q . this group is only supported by the its phylogeny, and the phylogeny analyses do not indicate an obvious species boundary. this suggests a close relationship between clade c and clade q. laetiporus clade c has previously been reported only from europe  <cit> . our study presents the first report of clade c in xinjiang, china. this species usually grows on hardwoods and conifers such as quercus, sorbus, populus, castanea, prunus, taxus, larix and picea in temperate areas, producing a yellow pore surface. clade q is also found in temperate areas in xinjiang, china, where it is associated with hardwoods such as salix, betula and populus and produces a yellow pore surface.

the maximum crown age of laetiporus is estimated at the early miocene  and east asia and north america are inferred to be the most probable ancestral areas . the notable finding is that three coniferous species  in temperate areas behave as sister species in the analyses of the combined dataset . moreover, the temperate host plants are diverse, including quercus, salix, populus, picea, larix, abies, tsuga, lithocarpus, fraxinus and acer; in contrast, the tropical host plants are limited in variety, including eucalyptus and guarea . based on these findings, an origin in temperate east asia and north america is proposed.

the independent sister species in group i indicate an east asian–eastern north american dispersal route before the estimated divergence time  in the early pliocene . this divergence time is close to the break time of the bering land bridge  at approximately  <dig> – <dig>  mya  <cit> . we speculate that their ancestor covered east asia and north america via the blb route and that regional speciation after the vicariance emerged due to the disconnection of the blb and the severe climate change at that time . this route is also present in the dispersal of other organisms, especially the common host plant quercus  <cit> . there may be a strong dispersal and vicariance correlation between laetiporus spp. and their host plants.

four laetiporus species in group ii with pan-american distribution exhibit a north american–central american–south american dispersal route. this group first diverged at approximately  <dig>  mya. north and central america are inferred to be the most probable ancestral areas. clade j, clade l and clade m are from central america and the estimated crown age is approximately  <dig>  mya, which coincides with the paleo-elevations that occurred during the late miocene and early pliocene  <cit> . the second intercontinental distribution between north america and south america is exhibited in group v . this route has been confirmed by biogeographical research on plants and animals . we speculate that the severe climate change that has occurred since  <dig> mya  <cit>  drove the migration from north and central america to south america and the adaptation to tropical host plants such as eucalyptus, guarea and dacryodes. the vicariance due to tectonic activity is thought to be responsible for the endemism of laetiporus in central america.

in group iii, four laetiporus species from east asia and south africa are closely related . the estimated divergence time of this group is  <dig>  mya. the dec analysis inferred east asia as the most probable ancestral area. however, it is notable that clade h does not form a robust sister relationship with clade o . we speculate that there is incomplete sampling from the indian subcontinent to africa because suitable host plants, such as eucalyptus, are abundant in these areas  <cit> . although the estimated divergence time is potentially inaccurate, the dispersal route between east asia and south africa is proposed.

the species in group v also exhibit a continuous distribution in europe and eastern north america . the dec analysis inferred a north american origin for this group, with an estimated divergence time of  <dig>  mya. clade e <dig> is found in the eastern north america and europe with low host-plant specificity. the short-lived north atlantic land bridge acted as a dispersal route until the low oligocene  <cit> . migration to europe seems unlikely, so the reasonable interpretation is that the human activity introduced this species into new habitats as proposed by feng et al.  <cit> . the wind and ocean current could be another driving force and reasonable explanation for the dispersal of fungal basidiospores between europe and eastern north america  <cit> .

the species in group vi and clade a <dig> have an east asian-european dispersal route. this route is probable because an exchange of species occurs for laetiporus and its most common host plants such as quercus, salix, populus, picea, abies and larix . it is reasonable to accept this route because the eurasian plate is continuous.

group iv consists of three different types of l. versisporus that are endemic in east asia . the infraspecific variation is obvious in these three types, but gene exchange and recombination still exist according to the clonal research of ota et al.  <cit> . this finding indicates that vicariance is important for regional speciation.

in addition, the migration of clade i to hawaii is surprising and worth exploring. we speculate that this example results from an incomplete sampling of molecular data. however, there are many standalone islands in the south pacific indirectly connecting hawaii, australia and malay archipelago. the frequent strong winds and continuous ocean currents are potentially responsible for the dispersal of basidiospores between islands. the humid climate and abundant host plants such as quercus, castanea and eucalyptus from the malay archipelago to australia  <cit>  are suitable for laetiporus. a dispersal route of east asia–malay archipelago–australia–hawaii seems unlikely. interestingly, eucalyptus, the host plant of clade i has been proven to colonize hawaii via this route  <cit> .

in our study, the samples of laetiporus are scanty in some areas around the world, such as south america, indian subcontinent, south africa and australia. the taxonomic situation is still unclear, and the evolutionary history of laetiporus remains incompletely understood. a wider range of sampling and further morphological studies, incompatibility tests, and more information of host range and distribution are needed.

CONCLUSIONS
the evolutionary history of laetiporus remains incompletely understood. however, this study presents some progress on this topic.  two novel phylogenetic species in east asia were identified.  our reconstruction and analysis of ancestral areas suggest that laetiporus originated during the early miocene  in temperate zones and that the combination of east asia and north america has the highest probability  of being the ancestral area.  we also predict that laetiporus may be present in the indian subcontinent, in australia and in the malay archipelago.  four intercontinental dispersal routes and a possible concealed dispersal route are proposed.  vicariance is suggested to play an important role in regional speciation, and recent human activity may render some geographical distribution inexplicable. further sampling and more molecular data are needed to further clarify the species affinity.
