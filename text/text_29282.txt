BACKGROUND
legume is the second most important crop family in the world, and is one of primary sources for the consumption of human and animals  <cit> . acquisition of nutrients from soil is a prerequisite for plant growth and development. plants are frequently exposed to adverse mineral stress in soils, including aluminum toxicity in acid soil, salt stress in saline soil and iron deficiency in alkaline soil. plants have evolved numerous mechanims to adapt to these stressed environments  <cit> . understanding of the molecular mechanims by which plants respond and adapt to the mineral toxicity and deficiency is a major challenge in modern plant biology.

as a model legume species, medicago truncatula gaertn has been widely used to study functional genomics because of its small diploid genome, self-fertility, short generation cycle and easy transformation  <cit> . there are a number of ecotypes of m. truncatula with large genetic variations  <cit> . of the ecotypes, m. truncatula ecotype jemalong a <dig>  has been used for the whole-genome sequencing and physiological studies  <cit> , while ecotype r <dig> is often used for gene transformation because of its superior in vitro regeneration  <cit> . m. truncatula ecotype r <dig> differs from its counterpart j. a <dig> in traits associated with development, and biotic/abiotic responses. for example, treatments of j. a <dig> with methyl jasmonate and ethylene induce resistance to fungal pathogen macrophomina phaseolina, while these treatments fail to induce resistance in r <dig> to the fungal pathogen  <cit> . in addition, rhizobial-induced expression of chitinase gene between the two ecotypes is also different  <cit> . the two ecotypes exhibit different tolerance to salt stress, such that ecotype j. a <dig> is more tolerant to salt stress than r <dig>  further studies reveal that a tfiiia-related transcription factor gene, mtzpt2- <dig> shows different expression in the two ecotypes, and that overexpression of mtzpt2- <dig> in roots confers enhanced tolerance to salt stress  <cit> . our previous work revealed that the two ecotypes also differed in their tolerance to deficiency in mineral nutrients. for example, ecotype j. r <dig> was more sensitive to iron deficiency than ecotype j. a <dig>  <cit> . despite the morphological and physiological differences between the two ecotypes, few studies have investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the differences due to lack of information on the genome of r <dig> 

dna sequences contain all the genetic information, and genome variations such as structure variations , short insertions/deletions  and single nucleotide polymorphisms  can explain many variations in morphological, physiological, and ecological traits  <cit> . resequencing technology provides a powerful tool to study these variations among species/ecotypes that are closely related genetically. for instance, thellungiella salsuginea exhibits exceptionally high resistance to cold, drought, and oxidative stresses as well as salinity  <cit> . the number of members in gene families with known functions associated with responses to abiotic stresses in t. salsuginea is greater than in arabidopsis thaliana, including those gene families of rav, nf-x <dig>  gras, hsf, hkt, cipk and cdpk <cit> . furthermore, it has been reported that maize inbred-line mo <dig> exhibits eminent heterosis due to its deletion of eighteen genes  <cit> . the two widely used m. truncatula ecotypes jemalong a <dig>  and r <dig> have been reported to differ in their tolerance to salt stress  <cit>  and iron deficiency  <cit> . to test whether the genome variations between j. a <dig> and r <dig> may account for the differences in their responses to mineral toxicity of aluminum and sodium and mineral deficiency of iron in growth medium, genome variations of m. truncatula ecotype r <dig> were analyzed by mapping the reads obtained from resequencing of r <dig> to the reference genome of ecotype j. a <dig> 

RESULTS
response of j. a <dig> and r <dig> to al3+ and na+ toxicity, and fe deficiency
to examine the effect of al3+ on root elongation of the two ecotypes, the relative root elongation was determined. as shown in figure 1a, root elongation was inhibited upon exposure of the two ecotypes to solution containing al3+, and the al3+-induced inhibition of root elongation in r <dig> was greater than in j. a <dig>  moreover, al contents in r <dig> roots were higher than in j. a <dig> roots , implying that an exclusion mechanism may operate in ecotype j. a <dig> plants. exudation of organic anions including malate and citrate to complex toxic al3+ in the rhizosphere is an important mechanism to tolerate al  <cit> . therefore, we monitored exudate of malate and citrate from roots of the two ecotypes in response to al3+ treatment. there was an increase in citrate exudation from roots of j. a <dig> and r <dig> plants by exposure to al3+, and the al3+-induced citrate exudation from roots of j. a <dig> was greater than that of r <dig> plants . in contrast to citrate, no significant increases in malate exudation from roots of the two ecotypes by exposure to al3+ were detected . these results suggest that higher exudation of citrate may underpin the greater tolerance of j. a <dig> to al than r <dig> plants. de lorenzo et al. found that r <dig> is more sensitive to salt stress than j. a <dig> plants as evidenced by less suppression of root growth in j. a <dig> plants than in r <dig> plants  <cit> . in addition to root growth, na+/k+ ratio is an important indicator for tolerance of plants to salt stress. excessive accumulation of toxic na+ in plant cells, particularly in the cytosol, disrupts k+ homeostasis, leading to dysfunction of plant cells, thus plants displaying high tolerance to salt stress often minimize na+ uptake and/or maximize k+ acquisition to maintain a low na+/k+ ratio  <cit> . therefore, we compared the effect of salt stress on na+ and k+ concentrations in the two ecotypes. no differences in both na+ and k+ concentrations in shoots of the two ecotypes were found when they were grown in the control medium . when they were exposed to solution containing nacl, an enhanced accumulation of na+ in both ecotypes was observed . however, exposure to salt stress led to reductions in k+ concentrations in shoots of both ecotypes, and the salt stress-induced reduction in k+ concentration was greater in r <dig> than in j. a <dig> plants . this led to an increase in na+/k+ ratio in both ecotypes, and the increase was significantly less in j. a <dig> plants than in r <dig> plants .

our previous work showed that the ecotype j. a <dig> was more tolerant to fe deficiency than r <dig> by efficiently mobilizing fe in the rhizosphere and transporting of fe from roots to shoots in j. a <dig> plants  <cit> . a similar result showing that ecotype j. a <dig> had higher foliar fe contents than r <dig> when grown in fe-deficient medium was observed in the present study . these results show that the two ecotypes differ in their tolerance to toxicities of al and na as well as fe deficiency by differently regulating citrate exudation, na uptake and fe transport, respectively.

resequencing of r108
paired-end sequencing method was employed to resequence the genome of m. truncatula ecotype r <dig>  and about  <dig>  gb original sequencing data were generated. high-quality reads of  <dig>  gb were obtained after initially processing. the genome of r <dig> is 17% smaller than that of j. a <dig>  <cit> . this led to a sequencing mean coverage and depth of approx. 72% and 11-fold over the whole genome, respectively . the coverage of chromosome  <dig> was the greatest among the chromosomes. in addition, we found a similar coverage of chromosome  <dig> in a tetraploid medicago falcata , suggesting that chr  <dig> may be the most conserved in the genus of medicago.

structure variations , short insertions/deletions  and single nucleotide polymorphisms  were identified by aligning the high-quality sequences against the reference genome of j. a <dig>  we obtained a total of  <dig>  svs,  <dig>  indels and  <dig>  snps in the genome of r <dig> .

the data were obtained by mapping the reads of r <dig> obtained from resequencing to the reference genome of ecotype j. a <dig>  svs were separated into insertions, deletions and others. indels were separated into insertions and deletions. snps were separated into homozygosity and heterozygosity.

structure variations are important types of differences among individuals of the same species, and can cause large alterations to the genome, resulting in the differences in phenotypes. we identified  <dig>  deletions,  <dig>  insertions and  <dig> other svs such as duplication, inversion and transposition by resequencing . the quantity of deletions was more abundant than other svs. this result is consistent with the forecast as the genome of r <dig> has been reported to be smaller than that of j. a <dig>  <cit> . we also identified  <dig>  indels ranging from 1–5 bp in length. among these short indels, the number of insertions and deletions was almost equal . insertion of one bp and deletion of one bp were the mostly observed insertions and deletions, respectively, accounting for more than half of the total number of insertions and deletions . generally, genome variations were mainly accounted for by snps. eighty-six percent of snps were homozygous over the whole genome . for the snps within coding sequences, there were  <dig>  nonsynonymous and  <dig>  synonymous snps, respectively. this led to a ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide  of  <dig> . a similar ratio has been reported in soybean and rice, while the ratio in arabidopsis  is smaller than our finding in the present study  <cit> .

variations of mineral element-related genes
the resequencing data obtained from m. truncatula ecotype r <dig> revealed that some genes involved in acquisition of mineral elements were deleted in r <dig> plants compared to ecotype j. a <dig> .
m. truncatula 
ecotype r <dig> plants

the data were obtained by mapping the reads of r <dig> obtained from resequencing to the reference genome of ecotype j. a <dig> 

aluminum-induced exudation of citrate from roots that is mediated by membrane transporters can detoxify toxic al3+ in the rhizosphere by forming non-toxic al-citrate complex  <cit> . several genes encoding the transporters of al-induced citrate exudation belonging to mate family have been identified  <cit> . our resequencing data show that 771 bp in the second intron of a gene encoding a putative aluminum-activated citrate transporter  was deleted . the sequence of mtaact was similar with the known al-induced citrate transporters . expression-level of mtaact in j. a <dig> was higher than in r <dig> in the absence of al3+, and it was up-regulated in both ecotypes by exposure to alcl <dig> with the al-induced expression of mtaact in r <dig> being lower than in j. a <dig> plants .

previous studies have shown that r <dig> is more sensitive to salt stress than j. a <dig>  and real-time qpcr showed that expression of mtzpt2- <dig> is greater in j. a <dig> than in r <dig> plants  <cit> . overexpression of mtzpt2- <dig> in roots of the salt-sensitive ecotype of m. truncatula confers enhanced tolerance to salt stress, suggesting that differential expression of mtzpt2- <dig> is responsible for the difference in adaptation to salt stress. resequencing allowed us to analyze the promoter sequence of mtzpt2- <dig> in r <dig> plants. stress-responsive-related cis-elements were identified by place database between j. a <dig> and r <dig> . the number of myc and w-box elements was greater in j. a <dig> than in r <dig>  which may underpin the higher expression levels of mtzpt2- <dig> in j. a <dig> than in r <dig> plants under conditions of salt stress.

ysls  are involved in long-distance transport of fe in plants  <cit> . there are five ysls in the genome of m. truncatula according to mt <dig>  assembly of the reference genome. our resequencing results show that an ysl gene  was deleted in the genome of r <dig> . the protein encoded by medtr1g <dig> is highly similar to arabidopsis atysl <dig>  . the deletion of the ysl gene in the genome of r <dig> may account for the less accumulation of iron in the shoots of r <dig> .

discussion
identification of genome variations using resequencing
analyses of gene expression by methods such as transcriptome, microarray and dge have been used to decipher the differential responses among species and cultivars/ecotypes with close genetic background to abiotic stresses  <cit> . however, these methods are less effective when several mechanisms underlie the different responses to abiotic stresses. moreover these methods cannot be used to analyze cis-acting regulatory elements. in contrast, resequencing technology can identify genome variations which are responsible for morphological and physiological differences  <cit> . in addition, cis-acting regulatory sequences obtained from the resequencing can be used to pinpoint the differential expression in response to abiotic stresses. estimation of phylogenetic relationships among medicago species by genome resequencing has been reported  <cit> . however, genome resequencing has not been used to investigate responses of medicago species to abiotic stresses in general and mineral stresses in particular so far. in the present study, we utilized this technology to decipher the mechanisms underlying the different responses of two m. truncatula ecotypes to aluminum toxicity, salt stress and iron deficiency.

tolerance of m. truncatula to al is achieved by citrate exudation
aluminum is the most abundant metal in the earth’s crust. phytotoxic al3+ is solubilized when soil becomes acidified. inhibition of root elongation is one of the earliest and most distinct symptoms exhibited by plants suffering from al toxicity  <cit> . plants have evolved numerous mechanisms to adapt to al toxicity. exudation of organic anions from root apices to chelate toxic al3+ in the rhizosphere is an effective way to detoxify al toxicity, thus conferring tolerance to al toxicity  <cit> . several al-activated citrate transporters have been shown to be involved in regulation of al tolerance. for instance, sbmate in sorghum  and hvaact <dig> in barley  that belong to the multidrug and toxic compound exudation  family have been identified to mediate al-activated citrate exudation. heterologous expression of sbmate in arabidopsis and hvaact <dig> in tobacco leads to enhanced citrate efflux, thus conferring tolerance to al toxicity  <cit> . the homologs in arabidopsis and maize have subsequently been cloned  <cit> .

in the present study, we found that root elongation of r <dig> was more inhibited by al than that of j. a <dig> plants , suggesting that r <dig> is more sensitive to al than j. a <dig>  we uncovered deletion of partial sequence in the second intron of a gene encoding a putative al-activated citrate transporter  in r <dig> plants by resequencing . the amino acid sequence of this transporter is similar with the known al-activated citrate transporters in other plant species . in addition, expression of this gene was up-regulated by al in both ecotypes with the magnitude of al-induced expression of mtaact in r <dig> less than in j. a <dig> plants , suggesting that expression of mtaact is sensitive to al3+. the suppressed expression of mtaact in r <dig> relative to that in j. a <dig> plants is likely to be accounted for by the deletion of the partial sequence of the second intron. the intron deleted in r <dig> plants may activate gene expression by enhancers within introns and/or regulating chromatin remodeling. several introns in plants are reported to increase the expression of genes. for example, the second intron from arabidopsis agamous gene can function in both orientations to drive expression of reporter gene from a minimal promoter  <cit> . the first intron of arabidopsis gene encoding elongation factor eef-1β has the similar function to enhance gene expression  <cit> . the lower abundance of mtaact transcripts in r <dig> than j. a <dig> when exposed to solution containing toxic al3+ may explain the less citrate released from roots of r <dig> than j. a <dig> plants in response to al treatment . the reduced citrate exudation from roots of r <dig> plants due to reduced expression of mtaact would render r <dig> plants less effective to complex toxic al3+ in the rhizosphere, thus making it less tolerant to al than j. a <dig> plants. the greater accumulation of al in roots of r <dig> than in those of j. a <dig> is in line with this argument .

promoter analysis of mtzpt2-1
the ecotype j. a <dig> plants have been shown to be more tolerant to salt stress than r <dig> plants  <cit> . a gene encoding a tfiiia-related transcription factor, mtzpt2- <dig> has been identified by its greater up-regulation in j. a <dig> than r <dig> plants under salt stress  <cit> . mtzpt2- <dig> can active the expression of many stress-responsive genes  <cit> . several stress-related cis-elements were found by analyzing the promoter sequences of mtzpt2- <dig> in both ecotypes . these stress-related cis-elements in mtzpt2- <dig> can allow this gene to be up-regulated in response to abiotic stresses, thus participating in the regulation of tolerance to abiotic stresses. two myb-core elements and aba-responsive elements  have been shown to be involved in responses to osmotic stress and aba, respectively  <cit> . however, the two ecotypes differed in their promoter sequences of mtzpt2- <dig>  such that mtzpt2- <dig> of j. a <dig> plants had one more acgt element, four more myc elements and two more w-box elements than r <dig> plants. there are reports showing the involvements of these cis-elements in stress response  <cit> . the greater number of cis-elements of mtzpt2- <dig> in j. a <dig> plants may explain higher expression of mtzpt2- <dig> in j. a <dig> plants than in r <dig> plants under conditions of salt stress, thus conferring their tolerance to salt stress.

function of ysl in iron transport
ys <dig>  has been identified to be involved in uptake of iron from soil by roots in maize  <cit> . based on their sequence similarity to the maize ys <dig>  eight ysls  were identified in arabidopsis. atysl <dig>  atysl <dig> and atysl <dig> are expressed most strongly in the vascular parenchyma cells  <cit> . the ysl1ysl <dig> double mutant displays strong interveinal chlorosis, and has reduced foliar iron content  <cit> . these findings suggest that ysls act as key mediators in unloading iron to mesophyll cell after iron is transported from roots through xylem in plants  <cit> .

five ysls were identified in the genome of medicago according to mt <dig> . however, in the genome of r <dig>  an ysl gene  was deleted . the protein encoded by the ysl gene had high similarity with atysl <dig> of arabidopsis . we hypothesize that this protein may be involved in unloading of iron from the vascular tissues to mesophyll cells. the deletion of this gene in r <dig> plants would impair iron unloading to mesophyll cells, thus leading to the reduced iron contents in shoots of r <dig> plants when grown in iron-deficient medium .

CONCLUSIONS
the two m. truncatula ecotypes jemalong a <dig> and r <dig> differed in their sensitivity to aluminum toxicity, salt stress and iron deficiency. resequencing of m. truncatula ecotype r <dig> uncovered a total of  <dig>  svs,  <dig>  indels and  <dig>  snps by comparing with the reference genome of j. a <dig>  we found that the partial sequence of the second intron of mtaact that encodes a putative al-activated citrate transporter was deleted. this partial deletion may lead to the lower expression level of mtacct in r <dig> plants than that in j. a <dig> plants in the absence and presence of toxic al in the growth medium. the reduced expression of mtaact in r <dig> plants in turn may render less exudation of citrate form roots to detoxify al in the rhizosphere, thus making r <dig> plants less tolerance to al than j. a <dig> plants. in addition, we demonstrated that promoter sequence in mtzpt2- <dig> of j. a <dig> plants contained more response-elements than that of r <dig> plants. given the regulatory roles of mtzpt2- <dig> in response to salt stress, these results may account for the greater tolerance of j. a <dig> plants to salt stress than r <dig> plants. finally, our results revealed that deletion of an ysl gene encoding an iron transporter in the genome of r <dig> plants is likely to impair long-distance transport of iron in r <dig> plants. this result may explain the greater sensitivity of r <dig> plants to iron deficiency than j. a <dig> plants. taken together, these findings demonstrate that analyses of genome variations by sequencing can shed important light on differences in responses of m. truncatula ecotypes to abiotic stress in general and mineral stress in particular.
