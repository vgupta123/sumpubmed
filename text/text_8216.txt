BACKGROUND
leishmania are parasitic protozoa transmitted by the bite of phlebotomine sandflies that are endemic to tropical and subtropical climates worldwide. more than  <dig> species of leishmania cause a wide range of human diseases that range from self-healing cutaneous lesions  to fatal visceral leishmaniasis , mucosal leishmaniasis  braziliensis), and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis   <cit> . leishmaniasis currently threatens  <dig> million people in  <dig> countries. it is estimated that  <dig> million new cases occur each year, with at least  <dig> million people presently infected worldwide  <cit> . recent reports also indicate that leishmaniasis is now an emerging zoonosis in the united states  <cit> . hope for discovering novel drug and vaccine targets stem from the recently fully sequenced genomes of several leishmania species  <cit> .

as opposed to higher eukaryotes, leishmania and other kinetoplastids seem to have lost or never acquired the ability to regulate transcription initiation by rna polymerase ii  <cit> . transcription has been postulated to initiate on each chromosome at divergent strand-switch regions ; the  <dig> - to 14-kb non-coding regions preceding opposite strand directional gene clusters   <cit> . these locations display skewed sequence composition which may be functionally relevant to transcription initiation  <cit> . typically, genes are grouped together into long, same strand polycistronic clusters where individual mrnas are processed by trans-splicing and polyadenylation . although there is evidence for antisense transcription in leishmania , nuclear run-on studies have demonstrated that transcriptional orientation is controlled by termination   <cit> . it has also been shown that convergent strand-switch  regions may be involved in transcriptional termination  <cit> . in light of these observations, it comes as no surprise that regulation of gene expression occurs largely at the post-transcriptional level in these parasites. the discovery of many rna-binding protein domains  <cit> , regulated processing of cytoplasmic rnas  <cit> , and conserved regulatory elements in 3' untranslated regions   <cit>  are hard evidence that corroborate this statement. several studies have shown that cis-acting sequences within 3'utrs regulate differential expression of the upstream gene mainly by modulating mrna stability  <cit>  or translational efficiency  <cit> , although other mechanisms may exist  <cit> .

to date, retroposons and long terminal repeat retrotransposons are the only transposable elements  that have been described in leishmania and trypanosome genomes. these class i tes compose up to 5% of trypanosomatid genomes  <cit> . leishmania major and l. infantum are believed to lack potentially active tes, such as ingi clade retroposons present in trypanosoma brucei  and t. cruzi   <cit> . however, the te-derived highly degenerated ingi/l1tc-related elements  have been reported in certain leishmania species  <cit> . recently, small degenerated retroposons  termed siders  have been identified in the genome of trypanosomes and leishmania via iterative pairwise blast queries and manual annotation  <cit> . these extinct repeats are apparently related to the ingi clade of retroposons, do not display apparent site-specificity for genomic integration, and are preponderantly distributed in the intergenic regions of dgcs. siders represent the most abundant te family described in trypanosomatid genomes to date and can be divided into two subfamilies, namely sider <dig> and sider <dig>  which present similar yet distinguishable sequence traits. a truncated portion of the antisense sider <dig> consensus was initially described as rs <dig> dispersed repeats in l. major mini-chromosomes by ortiz and segovia  <cit> . sider <dig> repeats have since been identified in l. infantum  <cit>  via a methodology highly similar to the one employed by bringaud et al.  <cit> .

this work aims at further improving the characterization of the highly abundant family of extinct sider retroposons in a full-scale comparative genomics framework. we present the first global characterization of both sider <dig> and sider <dig> elements via optimized statistical profiles and sensitive automated annotation in three sequenced leishmania species responsible for distinct pathologies. this enabled the comparison of both subgroups with other trypanosomatid retroposons, hence unveiling their evolutionary relation. also, the distribution of sider elements within leishmania genomes and among orthologous genes demonstrates that these extinct retroposons are not randomly distributed. various hypotheses entailed by this investigation are set forth as we discuss possible functional and evolutionary implications of the broad assimilation of sider elements.

RESULTS
optimized alignment and automated annotation of siders
in order to fully characterize both sider subgroups in the genomes of l. major, l. infantum, and l. braziliensis, we sought an efficient and automated method capable of producing reliable alignments when confronted with sequences displaying variable rates of conservation. to date, the only detailed characterization of sider sequences is a rigorous manual alignment of  <dig> l. major  sider2s set forth by bringaud et al.  <cit> , while the sider <dig> subgroup has yet to be properly portrayed. the scant sequence homology and size polymorphism of these degenerated retroposons make for irresolute multiple alignments, particularly with regards to the very heterogeneous sider <dig> subgroup. by applying metaheuristics for global parameter optimization and maximum likelihood estimators to a hidden markov model  representation of sider sequences , we generated a high quality alignment comparable to that published for lmsider <dig>  <cit> . this approach allows for unbiased classification of sider subgroups when considering the underlying phylogenetic tree .

it is apparent that sider elements form two phylogenetically distinct groups when glancing at the global sequence composition of the two main clusters in figure  <dig>  to further appreciate subgroup-specific traits, both major phylogenetic subgroups of lmsiders were separated and submitted to independent alignment optimization. once filtered to remove highly homologous sequences , the relative specificity of the initial profiles was tested by scanning all included lmsider sequences with both hmm profiles using a global alignment algorithm . improperly labeled sequences  were swapped to their appropriate profiles that were finally resubmitted to the same optimization methodology. the resulting hmm profiles were used for pangenomic queries which include the initial scans for l. infantum and l. braziliensis. results from the latter were submitted to one more round of optimization to generate the final refined profiles.

since version  <dig> . <dig> of hmmer software does not assign expectation values  to its predictions, we scanned a randomized synthetic genome of  <dig> mb composed of similar nucleotide frequencies  so as to ascertain the specificity of each hmm profile. a bit-score threshold of  <dig> limited false positives to one or two at most for each profile. all false-positives scored less than  <dig> with an average of ~ <dig>  bits . applying this threshold to all final predictions is forthright given the reasonably smaller size of leishmania genomes  in comparison to the synthetic control.

sequence-based characterization of the sider <dig> subgroup
consensus sequences were extracted from the final refined profiles for both sider subgroups and compared among the three species . it is apparent that the sider <dig> cluster is riddled with deletions when compared to the sider <dig> cluster, though the consensus of both subgroups share 48% sequence similarity. interestingly, sider1s appear to lack most of the second hallmark sequence of trypanosomatid retroposons  and present g/t-rich insertions at positions 545â€“ <dig> when compared to sider <dig> consensus.

to further understand the evolutionary origins of sider elements, we compared their sequence composition to that of the t. brucei siders  and the l. major degenerate ingi/l1tc-related elements . given their phylogenetic relationship to tbsiders , leishmania siders have seemingly diverged a long time ago, conceivably after the emergence of the genus. conversely, sider <dig> and sider <dig> subgroups apparently diverged prior to leishmania speciation, as both retroposons form separate monophyletic groups. it is also evident that sider1s are related to lmdires . this evolutionary relationship is confirmed by the comparative genomic distribution of lmdire and lmsider <dig> sequences. indeed,  <dig> of the  <dig> annotated lmdires overlap or are in close proximity to lmsider <dig> sequences . the expansion of lmsider <dig> elements stopped when the active autonomous ingi-like retroposons disappeared from the ancestral leishmania genome and became the present day lmdire vestiges.

intra- and inter-species chromosomal distribution of sider subgroups
the species- and subgroup-specific optimized hmm profiles were used to annotate the final positions of sider elements in leishmania genomes . both classes combined, we identified  <dig> lmsiders , an amount which correlates with the initial estimate of  <dig> identified with blastn and manual annotation  <cit> . in addition, we identified  <dig> l. infantum siders  and  <dig> l. braziliensis siders . our investigation suggests that the proportion of lmsider1/lmsider <dig> sequences is greater than previously proposed . l. infantum and l. braziliensis ostensibly harbor more sider <dig> sequences than l. major .

the results of the aforementioned sider search were combined to 3'utr predictions generated with pred-a-term, a leishmania-specific mrna extremity prediction algorithm  <cit> , in order to ascertain the relative genomic dissemination of sider elements . it has been shown that lmsider2s are preponderantly positioned in the intergenic regions of directional gene clusters and that most of these elements  reside within 3'utrs  <cit> . however, such estimates are derived from mrna extremity predictions based on an algorithm for the trypanosoma genus  <cit> . as detailed in table  <dig>  all three sequenced leishmania genomes withhold similar proportions of siders predicted in 3'utrs . on average, 76% of siders located in intergenic regions are enclosed in 3'utrs, at least partially, when considering all possibilities . it is quite evident that siders contained within 3'utrs are enriched in the sense orientation  for all three species. this observation correlates with the total proportion of siders in dgcs; sense siders are typically 4-fold more abundant than antisense ones. given the excess of siders situated in the same orientation as directional gene clusters, one would assume that sider elements located in "spacer" intergenic regions  should display similar statistics. quite the contrary, antisense siders are on average over 3-fold more abundant than sense-oriented ones in these interstitial regions. remarkably, antisense siders that map to these regions do not display appreciably lower bit-scores, which would be expected for sequences that are not subjected to purifying selection.

in spite of this, not all sider elements are limited to intergenic regions. a significant number of sider elements map to strand-switch regions . these chromosomal locations harbor 4â€“5% of all identified siders, which are seemingly evenly distributed between divergent  and convergent  strand-switch regions. however, a slight bias for sider2s in the divergent strand-switch regions of l. major and l. braziliensis can be observed . scrutinizing the composition of strand-switch regions illustrates their conspicuous association to sider elements, as roughly 40% contain siders on average . indeed, sider2s are 4- to 5-fold more abundant than sider1s in these locations and approximately 20-fold more for l. major in particular. there is also evidence that sider sequences may have been co-opted for protein-coding genes or pseudogenes in all three leishmania species. in some cases, a start or stop codon intersects with a sider element. these hits to the refined hmm profiles tend to present lower than average bit-scores for the main part . in agreement with our previous study  <cit> , very little siders locate to subtelomeric regions .

impact of widespread integration of siders on genomic organization and plasticity
a large-scale comparative plot of the genomic positions of sider elements with regards to annotated coding sequences was performed for all three genomes . the data confirm that sider elements of all types are quite uniformly dispersed throughout all three genomes. we identified three scenarios that highlight the impact of degenerated retroposons on the evolution of leishmania genomes:  the genomic position of siders is synonymous with that of the neighboring genomic locus in all three species ;  siders are located at different positions for at least one of the three species ;  reorganization of dgc synteny . the latter is an interesting example of chromosomal inversion with sider elements flanking the inverted region. this indicates that siders continue to forge leishmania genomes through homologous recombination events despite their extinct functions as transposable elements.

to further address the contribution of siders to the genotypic diversity of leishmania species, we investigated the association of these retroposons to orthologous genes in all three species. all leishmania ortholog predictions included in version  <dig>  of the l. braziliensis genome that present no more than one ortholog in l. major and l. infantum were extracted from genedb annotations  <cit> . the latter rely upon the orthomcl algorithm to predict all orthologs and recent segmental duplications   <cit> , thus ensuring that little or no genes are over-represented in the dataset. a total of  <dig> orthologous genes were retained , of which  <dig>  are potentially associated to at least one sider element. only  <dig> %  of the orthologs harbor a sider element in all three species . when excluding these mutually shared retroposons, l. major and l. infantum share the second largest proportion of sider-associated orthologs , whereas l. braziliensis shares only  <dig> % and 3%  of the sider-associated orthologs with either l. major or l. infantum, respectively. the observation that 31% of orthologs are associated to siders in only one species and that another 21% harbor siders in two out of three species supports the claim that these extinct retroposons may have undergone preferential assimilation or conservation in some species to some extent.

functional affiliations of sider elements
to determine if sider elements are preferentially associated to functionally related genes, we submitted the duplicate-free set of sider-associated orthologs to gene ontology  term enrichment via the amigo browser available from the genedb website  <cit> . when excluding genes of unknown function, our findings indicate that both sider subfamilies are in some measure preferentially associated with genes belonging to similar functional categories . when considering p-values inferior to 10- <dig>  sider <dig> retroposons are preponderantly enriched in the 3'utr of metabolic genes involved mainly in amino acid and amino acid derivative metabolic processes, nitrogen compound and amine biosyntheses cofactor and coenzyme metabolic processes, and carbon-carbon lyase and carboxylyase activities in the three leishmania species tested. the sider <dig> subfamily is generally less associated to common functional groupings, yet lisider1s present some evidence for enrichment in go terms distinct from sider2s, namely cofactor binding and tetracycline transport . overall, the go term enrichment analysis evokes that sider2-associated genes share some metabolic functions in all three species, which is not the case for sider <dig> elements that associate to genes with divergent go terms.

the next question was to assess if and to what extent sider elements are ontologically enriched in a species-specific manner. the non-redundant l. major orthologs from all  <dig> categories depicted in figure  <dig> were separated and submitted to go term enrichment. only sider-associated orthologs with assigned functions were retained for enrichment evaluation, the results of which are displayed in table  <dig>  the table summarizes the non-redundant go terms in the sampled orthologs that present a p-value smaller than  <dig>  when compared to the background set composed of all  <dig> functionally annotated genes. it is apparent that orthologous mrnas harboring sider elements in all three leishmania species are associated with a variety of genes chiefly pertaining to metabolic processes and functions. there is also evidence for species-specific enrichment of go terms in ortholog subsets where siders are not present in all species. for instance, l. major and l. infantum but not l. braziliensis share siders preferentially associated to genes involved in post-translational protein modification, phosphorylation, methylation, hydrolase activity acting on ester bonds, and carbon-sulfur lyase activity . conversely, some siders are strictly associated to l. braziliensis orthologs with significantly related go terms, notably cell cycle regulation, ribonucleoside metabolism, and aspartic-type endopeptidase activities. the remaining ortholog subsets comprise modest sample sizes, which may explain the lack of statistically significant enrichment.

discussion
the short interspersed degenerated retroposons of leishmania present varying degrees of conservation and important fragmentation. this renders in silico analyses challenging, prospectively requiring exhaustive manual annotation of results. the use of hmm profiles renders the heterogeneous nature of a multiple sequence alignment into a comprehensive statistical model encoding both positional base composition and interactions between residues, hence reducing the subjectivity entailed by non-profile-based search strategies  <cit> . version  <dig> . <dig> of hmmer has the advantage of bearing powerful nucleotide alignment optimization algorithms on top of precise homology search tools. these reasons justify the use of hmmer over other programs such as psi-blast or meta-meme  <cit> , although their effectiveness was not compared in this work. nonetheless, hmms have successfully been used to annotate tes in other studies  <cit>  and have also been shown to be more sensitive than pairwise or sequence-based methods  <cit> . the approach we advocate enabled the identification of sensibly the same amount of sider sequences in l. major as disclosed in our previous study  <cit> , however distinct genome assembly versions may explain the subtle differences . slightly more than  <dig> siders were identified in l. infantum and l. braziliensis genomes when compared to the  <dig> previously annotated in l. major.

the relationship between chromosomal proximity and sequence similarity of sider <dig> repeats in l. infantum was recently put forward  <cit> . requena et al. scrutinized the composition and arrangement of these elements on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  then compared the organization of sider2s on chromosome  <dig> of l. braziliensis and l. major. a laborious iterative blastn annotation strategy was conducted to uncover  <dig> lisider2s on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> on chromosomes  <dig>  using linear extrapolation, the authors estimated that around  <dig> sider2s populate the l. infantum genome. in comparison, the automated profiling method employed in this work revealed  <dig> and  <dig> high scoring lisider2s for the same chromosomes, respectively, and empirically annotated the position of  <dig> lisider2s. in the same article, the authors establish that lisider2s bear only one of the two  <dig> nt signature sequences that characterize the 5' of lmsider2s, and that the syntenic arrangement of sider2s is shared only between l. major and l. infantum . the species-specific optimized hmm profiles we utilized clearly delineate the presence of two sider <dig> signature sequences in all three species . furthermore, our results present the relatively conserved syntenic distribution of both sider subgroups for chromosome  <dig> and all the others . these observations further substantiate the use of profile-based approaches for sider alignment and genomic scanning. nevertheless, our data for l. major concur with requena et al. regarding the phylogenetic clustering of sider2s that correlates with chromosomal proximity . this is not the case for the sider <dig> subgroup, besides the highly similar sequences related to gene duplications.

the remarkable expansion of sider sequences throughout leishmania genomes in conjunction to their involvement in post-transcriptional regulatory processes  <cit>  are evidence that these ancient retroposons underwent exaptation, or domestication, by their host genomes. this affirmation is consistent with the strikingly biased distribution of siders within 3'utrs , as confirmed with recently published computational tools  <cit> . our previous studies have demonstrated a role for sider <dig> elements in post-transcriptional control by promoting mrna destabilization  <cit>  and of sider1s in translational regulation  <cit> . the ability of transposable elements to contribute regulatory sequences to eukaryotic genomes is now becoming increasingly apparent  <cit> . sider2s in all three analyzed genomes appear to be preferentially associated to groups of genes implicated in common metabolic processes. it is therefore possible that these sider2-associated genes are regulated in a coordinated manner, for example in response to certain nutrient availabilities in their environment. leishmania parasites are subjected to dynamic environmental changes within the phagolysosome, which have an immediate impact on their metabolic regulation  <cit> . several examples of coordinated mrna decay and multi-dimensional networks of post-transcriptional regulation have been reported in the budding yeast s. cerevisiae  <cit> . experiments are now under way to test this hypothesis in leishmania.

it has been shown that the  <dig> nt signature sequence from the distantly related l1tc retroposon can promote transcription of the downstream sequence in t. cruzi  <cit> . our data substantiate this finding since divergent strand-switch regions, known to be active transcriptional initiation points  <cit> , frequently harbor sider elements . this outcome is also observed for other trypanosomatid retroposons  <cit> . supporting the possibility that dss siders promote transcription initiation are several reports that attest to the profusion of te-derived sequences in experimentally characterized human promoters  <cit> . since  <dig> to 50% of strand-switch regions contain sider elements , a considerable portion of these opposing dgcs may have originated from homologous recombination events prompted by sider-related repeats, including dires.

a manifest inversion of synteny that is flanked by sider elements in l. infantum  demonstrates that short interspersed degenerated retroposons can be regarded as dynamic elements that play an ongoing role in genome plasticity and evolution. also, since many sider-associated genes share comparable functions in all combinations of species investigated, such differential recruitment further exposes their contribution to genotypic diversity. on top of that, the observed enrichment of antisense siders in interstitial pre-mrna regions  is quite intriguing . one cannot rule out that highly conserved regions shared between sense and antisense sider rna products could form rna duplexes, which might play a role in sider-mediated regulation. it has been shown that tes contribute tens of thousands of cis natural antisense transcripts to human genes  <cit> . the potential regulatory effects of these te-derived antisense transcripts are substantial. for instance, we have recently shown that overexpression of antisense sider <dig> rna can block sider2-mediated mrna degradation .

our work clearly demonstrates that sider <dig> and sider <dig> belong to two distinct phylogenetic groups. it is also apparent that, when compared to sider2s, sider <dig> sequences are more heterogeneous and bear only the first  <dig> nt signature . if one considers that sider <dig> and sider <dig> elements most likely fulfill distinct regulatory functions  <cit>  and that the second signature in sider <dig> is important for sider2-mediated mrna degradation , the lack of the second signature sequence in sider <dig> may be an evolutionary feat aiming at diversifying regulatory functions in these parasites. it is tempting to speculate that the degenerate nature of siders can provide an abundant molecular staple from which de novo cis-regulatory elements emerge. such a highly dynamic potential of regulation and adaptability is an effective strategy for a parasite to survive within its host.

finally, our work demonstrates that the common ancestor of trypanosomatids contained one or more retroposons that are no longer active in present day leishmania species  <cit> . indeed, dires  are the only vestiges of retroposons belonging to the ingi clade characterized in leishmania genomes so far. in l. major, most of the lmdires identified share their extremity or are in a close proximity to sider <dig> elements . our experimental annotation of lmsider1s did not exclude hits that overlapped with known dire elements, although the low frequency, large size, and poor conservation of dire retroposons in the genome would not significantly impact hmm modeling when contrasted to the over 15-fold higher abundance of sider1s. consequently, we postulate that sider <dig> elements have derived from long active ingi-related retroposons in the ancestral leishmania genome, as previously observed for the trypanosomatid rime/ingi and nartc/l1tc non-autonomous/autonomous retroposon couples  <cit> . the main difference between these retroposon couples is that ingi and l1tc are still active elements, whereas leishmania genomes do not contain active retroposon family belonging to the ingi clade. thus, the active retroposons that gave rise to sider <dig> is no longer active in the leishmania genus as only vestiges have been identified . no traces of a sider <dig> precursor have been detected so far, probably due to the evolutionary loss of corresponding dire sequences in the l. major genome. the possibility that such dire sequences have not yet been identified cannot be excluded, although the presence of dires in the genome of the two other leishmania species has not been reported to date. the dissemination of sider predecessors in intergenic regions supplied leishmania species with novel genetic material that contributed to increasing genomic plasticity and diversifying regulatory functions. their assimilation most likely helped the parasite gain an auspicious evolutionary edge with regards to its complex parasitic lifestyle. such a phenomenon is emerging as a widespread mechanism of assembly and tuning of gene regulatory systems in eukaryotes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the intra- and inter-genomic characterization of sider elements in three currently sequenced leishmania genomes enabled the first direct characterization of sider1s, which are more heterogeneous than sider2s, lack the second  <dig> nt signature sequence of trypanosomatid retroposons and share sequence traits with dire elements. our results confirm previous reports and establish that, in addition to the widespread localization of sense-oriented siders in 3'utrs, antisense siders are enriched in interstitial regions between polyadenylation and trans-splicing sites. our work also demonstrates that divergent strand-switch regions, proven to be involved in transcription initiation, frequently harbor siders.

the comparative analysis of the distribution of siders relative to protein-coding genes in three leishmania species provides evidence that a common leishmania ancestor was colonized by one or more active precursor retroposons. albeit siders are uniformly scattered throughout the genome, their integration is not random. siders are to some extent preferentially associated with groups of genes encoding a similar biological function, which alludes to their potential role in coordinating gene regulation. the fact that siders demonstrate species-specific associations to orthologous genes evokes their repercussion on genotypic diversity and possible contribution to species-specific gene expression. we propose that the abundance and diversity of siders increased the plasticity of leishmania genomes, providing the genus with molecular thread to weave fine-tuned regulatory fabric in response to the selective pressures arising from a complex digenetic parasitic life cycle.
