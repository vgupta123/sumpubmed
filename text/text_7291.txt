BACKGROUND
osteochondrosis  is a commonly diagnosed developmental orthopedic disease that is defined as a focal failure of endochondral ossification, the process by which a cartilage template becomes bone in the limbs of a growing animal  <cit> . it is characterized by the presence of abnormal cartilage within a joint that may be thickened, soft or collapsed or separated entirely from the underlying bone. in the last case, the condition is commonly referred to as osteochondrosis dissecans   <cit> . oc is widely recognized in young horses across breeds  and is of particular interest because of its potential to cause joint effusion and/or lameness in horses preparing for sales and entering training.

it has been postulated that oc could be caused by either abnormal forces on normal cartilage or by normal forces on abnormal cartilage  <cit> , but the exact pathophysiology is not yet understood. evidence from naturally-occurring disease and experimental models suggests that abnormalities in vascular supply to the articular cartilage and subchondral bone at anatomical predilection sites  underlie the condition . however, alternative theories include abnormal extracellular matrix maturation and inherited endoplasmic reticulum storage disorders . additional contributing factors that have been suggested include nutrition, exercise, conformation and other biomechanical factors, trauma, stress response, in utero environment and hormonal interactions . while it is generally accepted that a combination of genetic and environmental factors influence the development of lesions, response to environmental management alone is limited, highlighting the importance of genetics in this disease .

the genetic contribution of oc risk has been quantified in a limited number of breeds considered particularly prone to the condition, including standardbreds , french trotters  <cit> , warmbloods , and south german coldbloods  <cit> . based on these reports, it can be estimated that between  <dig> and 52 % of the global risk for developing oc can be attributed to genetic factors. variation in heritability estimates between populations is to be expected for any trait due to differences in population history, gene frequency and environmental exposures  <cit> . this is particularly true for oc since it has known environmental interactions and likely has multiple genetic alleles conferring susceptibility.

the presence of oc across domestic horse populations, including a feral horse population  <cit> , as well as shared major anatomical predilection sites and lesion morphology  <cit> , suggests a common underlying pathophysiology and shared major genetic risk factors across breeds. however, to date, the specific genes and alleles underlying oc risk in the horse are completely unknown. genome-wide association studies  have been performed in a number of breeds using both microsatellite markers and single nucleotide polymorphism  beadchips . these studies and follow-up fine-mapping efforts  <cit>  have identified multiple chromosomal loci that could potentially contribute to the heritability of oc. however, the findings have not been consistent across studies, and only a single attempt to validate putative risk loci in a second population has been reported  <cit> . further, while many potential candidate genes have been identified, only one has been investigated  <cit> , and a functional allele conferring risk was not identified. the lack of agreement in previous mapping studies may reflect confounding due to environmental risk factors and variability in phenotypic criteria for oc, or may represent true population differences in risk alleles. selection of a study cohort made up of related individuals with a shared early environment who all exhibit a similar phenotype may help to address these potential limitations of previous gwas.

here we describe the discovery of putative functional variants and validation of risk loci underlying genetic risk for tarsal oc in standardbreds. chromosomal regions of interest were identified by genome-wide association, enhanced by genotype imputation to a high snp density, in a discovery cohort of related standardbred yearlings born and raised on a single breeding farm in the united states. whole-genome sequencing was performed for a subset of these individuals for the purposes of variant discovery. variants were then prioritized based on predicted functional effect and segregation with oc status. selected putative functional variants were genotyped in both the discovery population and an independent validation cohort of norwegian standardbreds with tarsal oc. this is the first report of specific putative risk alleles associated with disease in two independent populations, and is an initial step towards the long-term goal of developing a genetic risk model for oc that would allow for genetic testing and quantification of risk in individual horses.

RESULTS
genome-wide association  analysis
horses in the discovery cohort  were genotyped on either the first-  or second-generation  equine snp chip. in order to combine data from the two platforms without loss of marker information, genotype imputation was performed using a previously validated pipeline  <cit> .  <dig>  markers were available for gwa analysis. the mixed model analysis in gemma, including sex and gait  as covariates, revealed  <dig> snps, nine on eca <dig> and one each on eca <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that showed moderate evidence of association with oc status  . the nine snps on eca <dig> defined two distinct loci. five snps were loosely clustered between ~ <dig>  and  <dig>  mb , while four snps defined a second region of interest between ~ <dig>  and  <dig>  mb. forty-two named genes,  <dig> predicted pseudogenes and  <dig> non-coding rnas were located within the two regions of interest on eca <dig> .fig.  <dig> manhattan plot of results from mixed model analysis using gemma. the  <dig> autosomal and x chromosome  are represented in different colors along the x-axis and the –log  is on the y-axis. each colored dot represents a snp. top hits are on eca <dig>  see table  <dig> for specific snps and p-values. the red horizontal line represents the level of genome-wide significance ; the blue line represents the cutoff for moderate association

haplotype analysis of the snps included in the gwa was performed within the two regions of association identified on eca <dig>  within the region from ~ <dig>  to  <dig>  mb, nine haplotype blocks were identified, made up of 2– <dig> snps and ranging in size from 8 bp to ~230 kb. haplotypes within three of these blocks were significantly associated with oc ; a haplotype in a fourth block was moderately associated with oc . the overall frequency of the three significantly associated haplotypes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  %, and they were more common in controls  than cases . within the region from ~ <dig>  to  <dig>  mb,  <dig> haplotype blocks were identified, made up of 2– <dig> snps and ranging in size from  <dig>  kb to ~484 kb. a haplotype from a single block was significantly associated with oc , and haplotypes from two additional blocks were moderately associated with oc . the frequency of the significantly associated haplotype was  <dig>  %, similar to the haplotypes in the other region; however, it was more common in cases  than controls . the two moderately associated haplotypes from this region were present less frequently in the population , but were also more common in cases  than controls  .

two additional gwa analyses were performed in the discovery cohort  after imputation enabled by the large snp lists generated during development of the new commercial equine snp chip . after pruning in gemma,  <dig>  and  <dig>  markers from the 670 k and 2 m sets, respectively, were available for inclusion in the gwa analysis. sex and gait were included as covariates in the gemma mixed model. analysis of the 670 k set revealed  <dig> snps that showed moderate evidence of association with oc status . an additional  <dig> snps on  <dig> chromosomes were within one order of magnitude of this significance. analysis of the 2 m set revealed  <dig> snps that showed moderate evidence of association with oc status . an additional  <dig> snps on  <dig> chromosomes were within one order of magnitude of this significance. the most significantly associated snps in both analyses were all located on eca <dig>  within the regions of interest defined by the original gwa analysis .

whole-genome sequencing
twelve individuals  were sequenced for a target of 6x coverage depth . six individuals  were sequenced for a target of 12x coverage depth . after filtering,  <dig> , <dig> variants were called, at an average of  <dig> variant every  <dig> base pairs. of these,  <dig> , <dig> were snps,  <dig>  were insertions and  <dig>  were deletions. the vast majority of variants, over  <dig> million , were not predicted to have any functional effect. of the  <dig>  variants predicted to have some functional effect,  <dig>  were of low impact ,  <dig>  were of moderate impact, and  <dig>  were of high impact .

sequenom genotyping in the discovery cohort
approximately  <dig>  million variants were evaluated from a total of  <dig> chromosomal regions that were either identified as regions of interest in our gwas or were chromosomal regions previously reported to be associated with tarsal oc . alleles were prioritized for follow-up according to predicted functional effect and segregation with oc status in the sequenced cohort. a high-throughput sequenom genotyping assay was selected as the most efficient way to evaluate a large number of prioritized alleles for association with oc in a larger cohort. in total,  <dig> variants on  <dig> chromosomes were genotyped in  <dig> horses from the discovery population . an additional  <dig> ancestry informative markers  were genotyped to use in construction of a mixed model analysis to control for population structure  <cit> . genomic heritability of oc, based on these markers, was estimated to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>   on the binomial scale, or  <dig>  on the underlying normal scale  <cit> .

after pruning in gemma,  <dig> snps were available for analysis. sex and gait were included as covariates in the model. the most significantly associated snp  was located in the first intron of arhgap <dig>  on eca <dig> . the alternate allele for this snp was found in 20 % of cases and 8 % of controls. of the  <dig> variants with uncorrected p-values <  <dig> , ten  were located within or immediately adjacent to the two eca <dig> regions of interest identified in the gwas . although sequenom snps were not chosen with regard to their location relative to haplotypes in the gwa data, four of these ten eca <dig> snps  were located within the boundaries of haplotypes that were significantly or moderately associated with oc  analysis).table  <dig> top snps from gemma mixed model analysis of sequenom genotyping data in the discovery cohort

sequenom genotyping in the validation cohort
horses in the validation cohort  were genotyped using the same custom sequenom assay as the discovery cohort. after pruning in gemma,  <dig> snps were available for analysis. as all horses in this cohort were trotters, only sex was included as a covariate in the model. the most significantly associated snp  was a missense mutation in exon  <dig> of gabra <dig>  a receptor, alpha 6) on eca <dig> . the alternate allele for this snp was found in 40 % of cases and 23 % of controls, and it was located on the edge of a haplotype found to be significantly associated with oc in the gwa data from the discovery cohort  analysis). of the  <dig> variants with uncorrected p-values <  <dig> , four  were from the eca <dig> regions of interest identified in the discovery cohort gwas. six variants were from regions reported to be associated with oc in the published gwas for the validation cohort    <cit> . interestingly, for all but one of these six snps, the alternate allele was more frequent in the unaffected horses  than in the affected horses . in contrast, the alternate allele for all four of the most significant eca <dig> snps was more common in the affected individuals  . snps with p <  <dig>  from two other chromosomal regions were shared between the two populations: eca <dig>  and eca <dig> . these regions of interest were identified from the discovery population gwas, although they were less significantly associated with oc than the regions on eca <dig> .table  <dig> top snps from gemma mixed model analysis of sequenom genotyping data in the validation cohort

discussion
gwa analysis in our discovery cohort of u.s. standardbreds identified  <dig> snp markers within two different loci on eca <dig> that were moderately associated  with oc status. these regions have not been identified as significantly associated with oc in any previously published gwas . this population differed from those in previous oc gwas in that there was a shared early environment between cases and controls, thus reducing the confounding effects of management factors such as diet and exercise. an additional advantage of this cohort was that individuals were closely related, thus potentially enhancing the number of risk alleles within the population and improving the power of the gwa to detect association with disease  <cit> . however, the sample size was still relatively limited, which may be why genome-wide significance was not achieved. the use of mixed model analysis in gemma allowed both for correction for population structure  <cit>  using a marker-based relatedness matrix  <cit>  and inclusion of covariates that may play a role in disease development, such as gait  <cit> .

snps are chosen for inclusion in genotyping panels based on their distribution across the genome and their frequency within the population rather than on their locations within protein-coding genes. of the five most significantly associated snps in the gwas reported here , three are in very large introns and two are intergenic, so these snps are likely “tagging” true risk variants with which they are in linkage disequilibrium   <cit> . horses exhibit extensive ld, and standardbreds in particular have the greatest long range ld  among horse breeds  <cit> . thus, it is reasonable that a snp demonstrated to be associated with disease in our gwas could be reflecting the effects of a risk variant up to 1 mb distant  from that snp marker. due to the large number of potential candidate genes within 1 mb of the regions of interest, and the extensive ld in standardbreds, we chose to perform whole-genome sequencing in a subset of our discovery cohort for variant discovery. one advantage of this approach, beyond its efficiency in cataloging both coding and non-coding variants, was that it allowed variant discovery to be carried out in eighteen horses, rather than just two or three. this resulted in a more complete picture of what variants were present in the population, as well as a better estimate of how these variants segregate with disease status, which helped with prioritization for follow-up in the larger group.

we investigated variants both within regions of the genome corresponding to gwas findings in our discovery cohort as well as from selected additional regions published by others as putative quantitative trait loci  for hock oc. genomic heritability calculations indicate that together these variants explain 10–20 % of the phenotypic variance for this trait. overall, snps from four loci on three chromosomes  were associated with disease status in both the discovery and validation cohorts. the association of putative risk alleles from within the same regions with disease status in two independently sampled populations of standardbreds suggest that these are true risk loci in this breed. population-specific risk factors may still exist  and will need to be investigated in future studies.

additional investigation of variants within the risk loci on eca <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> will need to be carried out in the populations reported here to identify specific risk alleles. there are several genes within the identified risk loci that are plausible biologic candidates for playing a role in oc and which contained variants that were highly associated with disease in either the discovery or the validation cohort, including mat2b, hmmr, ccng <dig> and arhgap <dig>  methionine adenosyltransferase ii beta  catalyzes the synthesis of s-adenosylmethionine . methionine is an essential amino acid in normal skeletogenesis  <cit> , and exogenous same is utilized therapeutically for osteoarthritis because of its beneficial effects on cartilage, including increased proteoglycan synthesis  <cit> . hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor  is a hyaluronan-binding protein that has been identified in epiphyseal cartilage, articular cartilage and interzone cells  in the developing joints of embryonic chicks, and is believed to play a major role in synovial joint formation  <cit> . the role of cyclin g <dig>  in cartilage has not been reported, but members of the cyclin family have been reported to regulate chondrocyte proliferation  <cit> , and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors have been shown to mediate growth arrest in chondrocytes  <cit> . gtpase activating proteins, such as rho gtpase activating protein  <dig> , are crucial mediators of the activity of rho gtpases, which play an important role in chondrocyte differentiation and normal long bone development  <cit> . clearly, variants in these genes will be of particular interest. however, in addition to variants within or near protein-coding genes, which have been our focus to date, we may need to consider a possible role for variants within non-coding/regulatory regions of the genome as we move forward.

CONCLUSIONS
here we report the discovery and validation of risk loci on eca <dig> for tarsal oc in standardbred horses. additional putative risk loci were identified on eca <dig> and  <dig>  although these were less significantly associated with disease status. together, the investigated variants explain 10–20 % of the phenotypic variance of oc in the reported population. this is the first report of a gwa analysis in a cohort of horses specifically selected for a shared early environment, the first to use imputation to greatly increase the number of available genotypes in the gwa population, and the first report validating putative risk loci for equine oc in an independent population. further evaluation of these risk loci should be attempted in standardbreds with oc lesions in joints other than the tarsus, and in another breed  affected by tarsal oc. this would help to determine if the identified risk loci are specific to the standardbred breed, or to tarsal oc or are universal risk loci for oc .

additional investigation is needed to identify the actual functional variants underlying disease risk within the validated risk loci. this is the first step towards the long-term goal of constructing a genetic risk model for oc that allows for genetic testing and quantification of risk in individual horses. this risk model could contain as many as 6– <dig> putative risk alleles, similar to those that have been used successfully to predict recurrence and survival in patients with breast cancer, another genetically complex disorder  <cit> . improved risk assessment will facilitate management changes and early intervention in high-risk horses and allow for informed breeding decisions in high-risk pedigrees that will ultimately help to reduce disease prevalence.
