BACKGROUND
olfaction is a sense for recognizing environmental chemicals. in many animals, olfaction plays crucial roles in various activities, such as foraging, migration, and mating. in vertebrates, odor chemicals are perceived by three evolutionary distinct groups of seven-transmembrane g protein-coupled receptors . genes encoding the main odorant receptors  form the largest multigene family in vertebrates. for example, over  <dig>  distinct or copies have been identified in the mouse genome  <cit> . in addition to ors, vertebrates have two distinct families of gpcrs for chemical receptors, called vomeronasal receptors family  <dig>  and family  <dig> . in mammals, these receptors are mainly expressed in the vomeronasal organ  <cit> , and are considered to be used for detecting pheromones. the v1r gene repertoire has been described in several mammalian species, the numbers of intact genes varying from a few to over  <dig>  <cit>  among species. the repertoire of v2r genes has been described in mice and rats  <cit> . the number of intact v2r genes is counted  <dig> in mice and  <dig> in rats  <cit> .

in teleost fishes that lack a vomeronasal organ, on the other hand, both main odorant and vomeronasal receptors are expressed in the olfactory epithelium  <cit> . recent database studies have revealed that fish ors and v2rs form multigene families with a hundred copies, respectively  <cit> . in addition, one v1r homolog has also been found in several fishes, and its expression confirmed in the olfactory epithelium  <cit> .

in the previous study, we identified  <dig> v2r genes and pseudogenes in the zebrafish genome  <cit> . this number is not small compared with the number of or sequences in this species   <cit> . thus, in zebrafish, the contribution of v2r to olfaction seems substantially large. the repertoire of v2r genes in each fish is considered to reflect the ability of olfaction in fish species, given that different v2rs bind to different sets of odor chemicals. the repertoire of v2r genes in fishes, however, is almost unknown except in zebrafish  <cit>  and fugu  <cit> .

it has been indicated that fish v2rs recognize mainly amino acids  <cit> . consequently, they are considered to be receptors for naturally occurring odors, not pheromones, because, in fishes, amino acids are common odorant substances found in natural waters  <cit> . however, recent studies on mammals have indicated that some v2rs recognize peptides released by individuals and are used for chemical communication. for example, a peptide pheromone secreted from the extraorbital lacrimal gland of male mice  was suggested to be recognized by v2rs  <cit> . v2rs may also be used as receptors for small peptides that serve as ligands for major histocompatibility complex  molecules  <cit> . mhc-based sexual selection is also known to involve olfactory mechanisms in fishes  <cit> . for instance, female three-spined stickleback gasterosteus aculeatus has been suggested to assess the degree of mhc diversity of their potential partners by sensing peptides for mhc ligands  <cit> . v2rs in fish are possibly also involved in chemical communication by small peptides like mhc ligands as in mammals. therefore, understanding the evolutionary dynamics of fish v2rs may provide some insights into the mechanisms of sexual selection and speciation in fishes.

the purpose of this study is to understand the evolutionary dynamics of the fish v2r gene family. for this purpose, we identified v2r sequences in zebrafish danio rerio, medaka oryzias latipes, fugu takifugu rubripes, and spotted green pufferfish tetraodon nigroviridis from their draft genome sequences by using several computational methods. recent advances in the molecular phylogenetic study of fishes have enabled us to infer the evolutionary process of fish v2rs with relatively reliable divergence time estimation   <cit> . in this study, the comparison and phylogenetic analysis of v2r repertoires in these fishes implied the organization and evolution of the fish v2r gene family. in addition, a possible evolutionary origin of the fish v2r family was inferred by comparing the genomic regions in fishes containing v2r genes with the homologous regions in some tetrapod species.

RESULTS
repertoires of v2r genes in zebrafish, medaka, fugu, and pufferfish
in order to characterize v2r genes in teleost fishes, we searched zebrafish, medaka, fugu, and pufferfish genomic sequences using the trans-membrane  domain of several representative fish v2rs known in fugu  <cit> , goldfish  <cit> , and zebrafish  <cit>  as queries. in this study, we identified v2r genes by combining a low-threshold tblastn search with profile hidden markov model-  based gene prediction. the identification procedure of v2r genes/pseudogenes is shown as a flow chart in figure  <dig>  putative fish v2r sequences obtained by this search were classified into two classes, putatively functional genes and nonfunctional pseudogenes. in this study, a gene was considered putatively functional if it had a complete coding sequence with up to two disruptions. if a gene had more than two disruptions or lacked the regions from tm <dig> to tm <dig>  it was considered as a pseudogene. we confirmed the exon/intron junctions by looking at the alignments of predicted v2r sequences, because v2r genes contain multiple exons. almost all exon/intron boundaries in our predicted genes were demarcated by standard gt/ag splice sites. we identified several v2r sequences with the complete tm regions but with short n-terminal region. particularly in fugu and medaka, these sequences were found mainly in the scaffolds less than  <dig> kb. these short sequences appear to be attributed to incomplete genomic data in these fishes. in the present study, v2r sequences less than  <dig>  bp were considered to be "partial sequences", and were not used in the phylogenetic analysis to avoid the loss of information. these partial sequences are indicated in supplementary tables . these partial sequences were also counted as putatively functional genes unless they have more than three disruptions.

as a result of the database search and gene prediction, we identified  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> v2r sequences in zebrafish, medaka, fugu, and pufferfish genomes, respectively. in these v2r sequences,  <dig> zebrafish,  <dig> medaka,  <dig> fugu, and  <dig> pufferfish genes were considered to be putatively functional. the proportion of putatively functional members in the v2r sequences in zebrafish  and fugu  were higher than in medaka  and pufferfish . however, these percentages may not be reliable because some of the v2r partial sequences may be attributed to the redundancy of the draft genome sequences. indeed, several putative v2r partial sequences identified in the previous version of the zebrafish genome assembly   <cit>  turned out to be redundant in the latest version of the genome assembly  examined in this study.

phylogenetic relationships of fish v2r genes
in addition, to determine the gene subfamily to which each of "v2r pseudogenes" and "partial sequences" belongs, a blastp search was conducted against putatively functional fish v2r amino acid sequences by using the translated pseudogene sequences of fish v2rs as a query. query sequences were assigned to the subfamily to which the best hit of the query belonged with more than 80% amino acid identity. as a result, all v2r pseudogenes identified in this study could be assigned to one of the  <dig> subfamilies defined by phylogenetic analysis.

a subfamilies of v2rs are defined in the neighbor-joining tree shown in figure  <dig> .

genomic distributions of v2r genes in zebrafish, medaka, fugu, and pufferfish
physical maps of v2r gene clusters in the four fishes are shown in figure  <dig>  most zebrafish v2r genes were located on three different chromosomes,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  two putatively functional v2r genes were found at ca.  <dig> mb intervals, with the same transcriptional orientation . both of these genes belonged to subfamily  <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  nine v2r genes and pseudogenes were encoded within a  <dig> kb region. all genes shared the same transcriptional orientation. the largest v2r gene cluster was found on chromosome  <dig>  thirty-four zebrafish v2r genes/pseudogenes and one family c v2r gene were located within a  <dig> mb region on chromosome  <dig>  twenty-nine genes and pseudogenes in this region were concentrated within a  <dig> mb region . on the other hand, in medaka and pufferfish, most of their v2r genes and pseudogenes found in this study were encoded in one chromosomal region. in medaka,  <dig> v2r genes and pseudogenes were clustered within a  <dig> kb region of scaffold  <dig> of its draft genome sequences. surprisingly, in pufferfish,  <dig> v2r genes and pseudogenes were clustered within only a  <dig> kb region of chromosome  <dig>  similarly, in fugu, most of the v2r sequences may also be encoded in a single gene cluster with high density, although they were separated into several different scaffolds. a fugu v2r gene cluster was reconstructed by referring to that of pufferfish , but the true relationship across the scaffolds has not been known so far. in fugu, only four representative scaffolds containing v2r genes are shown. in all fishes examined, genes in the same subfamily tended to be located close to one another , suggesting tandem gene duplication as the primary mechanism for expansion of the gene family.

comparison of the gene clusters among four fishes revealed similarities in the arrangements of fish v2r genes in the gene subfamily level . first, the arrangement of v2r genes in the middle of the cluster begins with subfamilies  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and end with subfamily  <dig>  in all four fishes. second, the position and orientation of one subfamily  <dig> gene also seems common to all species. such concordance is likely to reflect the gene order of the v2r cluster in the common ancestor of the four fishes.

comparison of the genomic region containing v2r gene cluster in fish with corresponding regions in tetrapods
to find the tetrapod genomic region corresponding to the fish region that contains the v2r gene cluster, putative orthologs of several genes that are commonly located proximal to fish v2r gene clusters were identified in tetrapod genomic sequences . initially, we characterized neprilysin, phospholipase c-η <dig> , acetyl coenzyme a transporter  <dig> , and gmp syntase  homologs in fish genomes, near the fish v2r gene cluster. the v2r clusters in pufferfish and medaka were located between neprilysin and plc-η <dig> . in zebrafish, plc-η <dig> was found near the v2r gene cluster in chromosome  <dig>  but the neprilysin homolog was not found. on the other hand, slc33a <dig> and gmps were identified near the family c v2r gene on zebrafish chromosome  <dig>  but not in medaka scaffold  <dig> and pufferfish chromosome  <dig>  subsequently, putative orthologs of these four genes were identified in the tropical clawed frog , chicken , mouse , and human  genomes. all four genes  were tandem linked on specific chromosomal regions in all tetrapod species examined . the relative positions and orientations of these genes in fishes were well consistent with those in tetrapods, indicating that the synteny of the genomic region is highly conserved between teleosts and tetrapods. however, the v2r gene cluster located between neprilysin and plc-η <dig> genes in fishes was not found in any tetrapods. on the other hand, one or more family c v2r genes near slc33a <dig> and gmps genes were observed commonly in zebrafish, frog, mouse, and human genomes, although not in the chicken genome.

discussion
large variation of v2r gene repertoire among fish species
in this study, we identified the v2r gene repertoire in fishes by searching zebrafish, medaka, fugu, and pufferfish draft genome sequences. our results provide the first global outline of the fish v2r gene repertoire. in this study, we showed that the numbers of functional v2rs varied substantially among fishes. we identified  <dig> putatively functional v2r genes in zebrafish, that were much more than in other fishes . the larger number of v2r genes in zebrafish is mainly attributed to species-specific gene duplication events in subfamilies  <dig> and  <dig> . table  <dig> shows the numbers of putatively functional chemical receptor genes identified in the four fishes. the size of the putatively functional v2r repertoire varies by  <dig> -fold among the four fishes. this size variation of fish v2r is larger than that of or . in addition, the numbers of fish v1r and taste receptors  are almost the same in all fishes ; fish v1r gene, in particular, is a single copy in all fishes examined  <cit> . thus, the v2r family is considered to be the most variable chemical receptor gene family in fishes. such a high variation in sizes of the v2r gene family is also observed in mammals. sixty one and  <dig> functional v2r genes have been identified in the mouse and rat, respectively  <cit> , whereas no functional v2r gene has been found in human and other primates  <cit> .

only putatively functional genes are considered. the numbers of ors, t2rs, and taars in medaka, and taars in pufferfish have been unknown.

a v2r, vomeronasal receptor family 2; v1r, vomeronasal receptor family 1; or, main odorant receptor; t1r, taste  <dig> receptor; t2r, taste  <dig> receptor; taar. trace amine-associated receptor.

recently, the trace amine-associated receptor  family has been shown to be used as odorant receptors in mice  <cit> . homologs of taar genes are also found in fishes  <cit> , and some of them are suggested to be expressed in the olfactory epithelium in zebrafish  <cit> . therefore, also in fishes, taar family is likely to be used for perception of odor chemicals. interestingly, the size of the functional taar repertoire varies by  <dig> -fold between zebrafish and fugu . it is possible that the differences of v2r and taar gene repertoires mainly cause the difference of odor sensitivity among fish species.

evolution of the fish v2r gene family
phylogenetic analysis of v2rs and several "v2r-related" gpcrs   <cit>  revealed that the four gpcr families, gprc6as, casr, family c v2r, and v2rs , were separated before the divergence of teleost fish and tetrapods . in fishes, gprc6as and casrs appear to be functionally distinct from v2rs  because their expression profiles seem different from the fish family a+b v2r genes. it is known that in fish, casr is expressed mainly in the kidneys and functions as a salinity sensor  <cit> . in goldfish,  <dig>  receptor  is expressed in olfactory cells, responding to naturally occurring amino acids  <cit> . however, goldfish  <dig>  receptor is expressed not only in the olfactory epithelium, but also in the gills, tongue, and other tissues  <cit> . in human, gprc6a is reported to be widely expressed in the brain and peripheral tissues with highest levels in the kidney, skeletal muscle, testis, and leucocytes  <cit> . additionally, gprc6a and casr were single copy genes in the four fishes. this also suggest that these receptors are not involved in the distinction of the diverse array of odor chemicals. fish family c v2r is also a single copy gene in all four fishes , and thus, may be functionally distinct from other fish v2rs ; however, the expression of the fish family c v2r is not yet known and further studies are needed.

the present phylogenetic analysis also indicated that fish v2rs were further subdivided into at least  <dig> subfamilies that diverged before the divergence between the lineages of zebrafish and three other fishes . the number of v2r genes in each subfamily was remarkably different among species as discussed above. generally, the evolution of vertebrate odorant and vomeronasal receptors is characterized by rapid gene turnover and lineage-specific phylogenetic clustering  <cit> . these characteristics are also observed in fish v2rs. indeed, the phylogenetic tree shows that fish v2r genes tend to form species-specific gene clades . these v2r subfamilies unique to each species may be related to the adaptation to species-specific environmental odor and/or pheromonal signals. on the other hand, almost one-to-one orthologous relationships were found among the four fishes in four subfamilies,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . these v2rs may be used to perceive common odor substances to these fishes, like amino and nucleic acids  <cit> .

in fishes, most v2r genes were located on one specific genomic region as a gene cluster . interestingly, the arrangements of v2r genes in the cluster appear to be well conserved among species at the gene subfamily level . this suggests that the ancestral fish v2r gene cluster was already present in the most recent common ancestor of the four fishes. in zebrafish, two gene clusters were found on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  two indirect pieces of evidence strongly suggest that the two zebrafish v2r gene clusters originated from one chromosomal translocation occurred in the zebrafish lineage. first, genes in each of these clusters were not phylogenetically clustered . second, a genomic region near one gene in subfamily  <dig>  that contains several genes in subfamilies  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were lacking only in the zebrafish chromosome  <dig> gene cluster , and these genes were located on the chromosome  <dig> gene cluster .

from the synteny of neprilysin, plc-η <dig>  and several genes between fishes and tetrapods, we could identify the genomic region of tetrapods that corresponds to the fish genomic region containing the v2r gene cluster . physical maps of this region  show that the v2r gene cluster located between neprilysin and plc-η <dig> is fish-specific and are not found in tetrapods. this indicates that the v2r gene cluster in fishes has been originated after the separation of teleost and tetrapod lineages. the maps also show that one or more family c v2r genes are located near slc33a <dig> and gmps genes commonly found in the zebrafish, frog, mouse, and human in common. this suggests that the family a+b of fish v2rs has been originated by a tandem duplication of the ancestral v2r gene occurred before the divergence of teleosts and tetrapods , and the family c of v2rs is the sister of the family a+b . this may also indicate that one of the ancestral v2r family a+b located in the genomic region between neprilysin and plc-η <dig> was increased in their number by tandem gene duplications, only in the lineage of teleosts, but not of tetrapods.

in the last part of this section, we summarize the long-term evolutionary scenario of the fish v2r gene family. before the divergence of teleost fish and tetrapod lineages, an ancestral v2r  gene and family c v2r gene had diverged from one common ancestral v2r gene by tandem gene duplication. after teleost-tetrapod divergence   <cit> , in the common ancestor of the four fishes, prototypes of fish v2r gene subfamilies observed in the present fishes  had been generated by tandem gene duplications from the ancestral v2r  gene. then, these prototype v2r genes formed a gene cluster. during the evolution of the lineages of the four fishes, gene duplications and losses occurred in each of these lineages. in the zebrafish lineage that had diverged from other fish lineages at ca.  <dig> mya, the v2r gene cluster separated into two, and genes in subfamilies  <dig> and  <dig> have increased their numbers within the gene clusters in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. in the medaka lineage , subfamily  <dig> genes have increased their copies within the gene cluster. in the fugu and pufferfish lineage, it appears that v2r sequences in some subfamilies are pseudogenized only in the pufferfish . for instance, in subfamily  <dig>  fugu has five putatively functional genes, but in pufferfish, four out of five are pseudogenes. similarly, in subfamily  <dig>  fugu has seven genes and one pseudogene, whereas pufferfish has four pseudogenes and no functional gene. this implies that, in the pufferfish lineage, after the separation from the fugu lineage , some v2rs might lose their function by some biological reasons, such as the adaptation to freshwater environment. in the future, to elucidate the more detailed evolutionary process of v2r  gene family, data from nonteleost fishes, namely "ancient fish"  <cit> , seem to be useful. in addition, to clarify the divergence period of v2r family to the other family  <dig> gpcr families, examination of elasmobranchii fishes  may be one of important steps of studies.

functional significance of the genes located near the fish v2r gene cluster
two protein-coding genes, neprilysin and plc-η <dig>  are located near the fish v2r gene cluster . interestingly, it appears that the products of these genes can interact with v2rs. langenau and colleagues  <cit>  reported that the transcription of neprilysin was upregulated in the ovary of yellow perch , incubating it with 17α, 20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one  that stimulated fish ovulation. neprilysin is a membrane-bound neutral peptidase expressed in various tissues  <cit> . some peptides that are cleaved by neprilysin may be released into the water from individuals and spawned eggs, and perceived by some v2rs. such peptides might be used as a signal in reproduction and/or identity in fishes. recent studies in mammals have indicated that v2rs are receptors for peptide sex pheromones  <cit>  and mhc ligands  <cit> . these studies may be consistent with the hypothesis that fish v2rs are also used to recognize peptides that serve as reproductive and/or individuality signals. it is also interesting that  <dig>  20-p is one of the components of the pre-ovulately pheromone which affects male goldfish  <cit> .

plc-η <dig> is one of the η-type phospholipase c, localized specifically in neurons. v2rs are included in the family  <dig> gpcrs, which is known to be coupled with phospholipase c  <cit> . western blot analysis showed that, in mouse, plc-η <dig> protein was not localized in the olfactory epithelium or the vomeronasal organ  <cit> . this suggests that plc-η <dig> is not coupled with v2rs; however, it was also shown that plc-η <dig> was localized in the main- and sub-olfactory bulbs  <cit> . this implies some functional relationship between plc-η <dig> and the odorant recognition system in vertebrates.

the close linkage between the genes encoding v2rs and neprilysin/plc-η <dig> in fishes seems to be an intriguing finding in light of the function of fish v2r genes. functional studies of neprilysin and plc-η <dig> could provide further information on the evolutionary mechanisms of fish v2rs.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we have presented the repertoire of v2r gene family in the four teleost fish species. the number of intact v2r genes in these fishes varied from  <dig> in pufferfish to  <dig> in zebrafish. phylogenetic analysis has shown that the evolution of fish v2rs are characterized by rapid gene turnover and lineage-specific clustering, as known in ors and v1rs  <cit> . such evolutionary patterns may suggest that fish v2rs are involved in the lineage-specific adaptation to different odor environments for each fish species. in addition, we elucidated substantial parts of the long-term evolution of fish v2r gene family, by phylogenetic and comparative genome analyses. we believe that our results provide one of the foundation to the future functional and evolutionary studies of fish v2r gene family.
