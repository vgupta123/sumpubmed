BACKGROUND
s100a <dig> is a member of the s <dig> family of small, dimeric, ef-hand proteins. the s <dig> proteins, of which there are  <dig> family members in humans, primarily function as ca2+-sensors to modulate a multitude of biological processes. the majority of s <dig> proteins are symmetric dimers characterized by the presence of two ef-hand ca2+-binding loops per subunit; an n-terminal pseudo ef-hand  comprising  <dig> residues and a c-terminal canonical ef-hand  comprising  <dig> residues  <cit> . calcium-binding to the c-terminal ef-hand induces a structural rearrangement involving the reorientation of helix  <dig> relative to helix  <dig>  resulting in the exposure of a hydrophobic cleft that forms the binding surface for target proteins  <cit> . as a consequence, target binding for most s <dig> proteins is strictly ca2+-dependent.

the reported equilibrium dissociation constants  for the s100a4/ca2+ interaction are relatively weak in the absence of target  and increase approximately 10-fold in the presence of target   <cit> . studies with other s <dig> proteins suggest that the increased ca2+-binding affinity observed in the presence of target is due to a ligand-induced reduction in s <dig> backbone and side chain dynamics  <cit> . localized target-mediated enhancement of the s100a4/ca2+ interaction would permit high intracellular s100a <dig> expression levels  without the depletion of free intracellular ca2+ levels and the disruption of ca2+ oscillations. proteomic and localization studies have shown that s100a <dig> is enriched in the pseudopodia of migrating cells  <cit> . moreover a s100a <dig> biosensor, which reports on ca2+-bound s100a <dig>  has shown that activated s100a <dig> localizes to the leading edge of polarized, migrating cells  <cit> . the enrichment of s100a <dig> in protrusive structures is consistent with cell-based functional studies demonstrating that s100a <dig> expression modulates the migratory capacities of a broad range of cell types  <cit> . consistent with a role in regulating cell motility, s100a <dig> has a number of reported cytoskeletal and scaffold protein targets including non-muscle tropomyosin  <dig>  liprin-β <dig> and non-muscle myosin-iia  <cit> .

non-muscle cells can express three myosin-ii heavy chain isoforms , which exhibit 64-80% amino acid identity  <cit> . each heavy chain is comprised of an n-terminal motor domain that contains the atp- and actin-binding sites, an intermediate rod domain that dimerizes to form an α-helical coiled-coil and a c-terminal tailpiece. despite the fairly high sequence conservation between the non-muscle myosin-ii isoforms, studies with assembly-competent myosin-ii rod constructs, which lack the myosin-ii motor domain, demonstrate that s100a <dig> preferentially recognizes and disassembles myosin-iia rods  <cit> . although recent reports indicate that s100a <dig> binds with high affinity to isolated myosin-iic peptides, s100a4-mediated regulation of myosin-iic assembly has not yet been examined  <cit> . for myosin-iia, studies in mammary adenocarcinoma cells have shown that the s100a4/myosin-iia interaction regulates the placement of pseudopodial protrusions during chemotactic migration  <cit> . in addition, macrophages with a genetic deletion for s100a <dig> exhibit a myosin-iia overassembly defect that results in impaired cellular protrusions and defective chemotaxis  <cit> . together these data support a role for the s100a4/myosin-iia interaction in modulating pseudopodial structures, and as a consequence, chemotaxis. consistent with its function in modulating cellular motility, s100a <dig> overexpression enhances the invasive capabilities and metastatic dissemination of tumor cells  <cit> .

we report the structure of the ca2+-s100a4/myosin-iia complex, which demonstrates an unusual mode of s <dig> protein target recognition, and is in accordance with the recently described x-ray and nmr structures of s100a <dig> bound to longer myosin-iia peptides  <cit> . in addition, biophysical studies of the ca2+-s100a4/myosin-iia complex suggest that instability of the myosin-iia coiled-coil is a contributing factor to s100a4-mediated myosin-iia depolymerization.

RESULTS
interaction of s100a <dig> with myosin-iia
our previous studies showed that s100a <dig> binds the miia1904- <dig> peptide with a stoichiometry of one peptide per s100a <dig> dimer  <cit> . to examine the interaction of s100a <dig> with a longer, more physiologically-relevant myosin-iia construct, we used miia1851- <dig>  which contains approximately  <dig> residues from the myosin-iia coiled-coil and the entire c-terminal tailpiece, and encompasses the myosin-ii extended assembly competence domain  <cit> . miia1851- <dig> inhibits binding of the miia1904- <dig> peptide to s100a <dig> with an ic <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm . circular dichroism spectroscopy of miia1851- <dig> demonstrated that the peptide is primarily α-helical as evidenced by characteristic minima at  <dig> and 208 nm . an examination of the thermal stability of miia1851- <dig> revealed a relatively modest transition midpoint  of 27°c for unfolding , which was reversible . the dimeric state of miia1851- <dig> was confirmed by sedimentation equilibrium studies performed at 22°c . while our thermal denaturation studies suggest some miia1851- <dig> monomer may be present, we did not detect any monomer in sedimentation equilibrium studies which were performed at higher protein concentrations than the thermal stability assays.

bpredicted molecular weights are based on sequence, which were confirmed by mass spectrometry; s100a <dig> dimer –  <dig> .6 g/mol; miia1851- <dig> monomer –  <dig> .5 g/mol.

sedimentation equilibrium studies of the s100a4/miia1851- <dig> complex using a  <dig> : <dig> molar ratio of miia1851- <dig> dimer to s100a <dig> dimer revealed a species with a weight-average molecular mass of  <dig>  ± 425 da, which is consistent with the predicted mass of a s100a <dig> dimer with a single bound miia1851- <dig> polypeptide chain  . at a 1: <dig> molar ratio of miia1851- <dig> dimer to  <dig> s100a <dig> dimer we observed a weight-average molecular mass of  <dig>  ± 490 da, which likely corresponds to a mixture of s100a <dig> dimers with a single bound miia1851- <dig> polypeptide chain and miia1851- <dig> dimers .

given the similarity in the molecular weights of the s100a <dig> and miia1851- <dig> dimers, the s100a4/miia1851- <dig> complex was further evaluated in sedimentation velocity experiments where miia1851- <dig> was added to s100a <dig> at increasing molar ratios. the time derivative plots for miia1851- <dig> alone  and s100a <dig> alone  showed that each protein sedimented as a single homogenous species with s values of  <dig>  s and  <dig>  s, respectively . at a molar ratio of  <dig> : <dig> miia1851- <dig> dimer to s100a <dig> dimer there was a shift in the s value to  <dig>  s consistent with the formation of an s100a4/miia1851- <dig> complex . at increasing molar ratios of miia1851- <dig> dimer to s100a <dig> dimer , the best fit for the time derivative plot was to a two-component model. this analysis indicated a peak at  <dig>  s that corresponded to the s100a4/miia1851- <dig> complex and a second peak at  <dig>  s, which was consistent with the presence of unperturbed miia1851- <dig> dimer . the  <dig>  s species had an estimated mass of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kda. given the thermal instability of miia1851- <dig> and our observation that s100a <dig> forms a thermostable dimer at submicromolar concentrations  <cit> , the  <dig>  s species likely corresponds to a s100a <dig> dimer bound to a single miia1851- <dig> polypeptide , which is consistent with our previous chemical cross-linking studies  <cit> .

characterization of s100a4Δ8c
since we were unable to crystallize the wild-type full-length s100a <dig> with myosin-iia peptides and our previous structural studies demonstrated that at high protein concentrations residues glu91-gln <dig> mediate interactions between symmetry-related s100a <dig> dimers in the crystalline state  <cit> , we created a series of s100a <dig> c-terminal truncations  that were expected to reduce s100a <dig> self-association. the s100a4Δ8c construct was used since it exhibited minimal self-association in the myosin-iia peptide-bound state as assessed by dynamic light scattering and nmr. the ability of s100a4Δ8c to bind myosin-iia was assessed in an anisotropy assay using fitc-labeled miia1904- <dig>  which binds wild-type s100a <dig> with a kd of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  <cit> . the measured dissociation constant for s100a4Δ8c  was comparable to that observed for the wild-type s100a <dig> . in addition, binding was ca2+-dependent as no binding was observed in the presence of egta . using assembly competent myosin-iia rods , we monitored the ability of s100a4Δ8c to disassemble preformed myosin-iia filaments. at a molar stoichiometry of one s100a4Δ8c dimer per myosin-iia rod, s100a4Δ8c disassembled approximately 85% of the myosin-iia filaments, which was similar to the disassembly observed in the presence of wild-type s100a <dig> .

x-ray structures of s100a4Δ8c and the s100a4Δ8c/miia1908- <dig> peptide complex
both the s100a4Δ8c and s100a4Δ8c/miia1908- <dig> peptide structures were determined by molecular replacement using the native ca2+-s100a <dig> structure  truncated at glu <dig> as the search model  <cit>  . for the apo-s100a4Δ8c structure there were four molecules in the asymmetric unit , with continuous density from residues cys3-gly <dig> for all molecules. residues in the favored, allowed and disallowed regions in the ramachandran plot account for  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total residues, respectively. the s100a4Δ8c/miia1908- <dig> structure contained a single s100a <dig> dimer in the asymmetric unit with the miia1908- <dig> peptide bound asymmetrically across the dimer interface. the electron density was continuous from residues ala2-gly <dig> for both molecules in the asymmetric unit, except for residues gly47-arg <dig>  of subunit a, which were not modeled. continuous difference density was observed in difference fourier syntheses  following the first round of refinement, indicating the presence of a highly ordered peptide, asymmetrically bound to the s100a <dig> dimer . residues in the favored, allowed and disallowed regions in the ramachandran plot account for  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total residues, respectively. the two residues in the disallowed region, which deviate slightly from expected values, are arg <dig>  from the disordered region and the c-terminal gly <dig>

the  <dig>  Å structure of the s100a4/miia1908- <dig> complex revealed a single miia1908- <dig> peptide binding across the s100a <dig> dimer interface . electron density was observed only for residues asp1908-leu <dig> of the miia1908- <dig> peptide. as shown in figure 5a, there is an extensive h-bond network between myosin-iia residues asn <dig>  ser <dig> and lys <dig>  and ser <dig> and gln <dig> on subunit b. in addition peptide residues glu <dig> and lys <dig> form h-bonds with gln <dig> and lys <dig> of subunit a. met <dig>  val <dig>  leu <dig> and leu <dig>  which correspond to the a and d positions of the myosin-iia coiled-coil , also partcipate in s100a <dig> binding. met <dig> and val <dig> intercalate between helices  <dig> and 4′ at the s100a <dig> dimer interface, while leu <dig> and leu <dig> insert into the hydrophobic cleft of subunit a .

the total buried surface area upon complex formation is appproximately 1348 Å <dig>  where 684 Å <dig> and 664 Å <dig> are contributed by the miia1908- <dig> peptide and s100a <dig>  respectively. overall, nearly  <dig> contacts with a separation of less than  <dig>  Å and  <dig> hydrogen bonds are observed at the myosin-iia peptide and s100a <dig> interface. the calculated rms deviations for cα atoms for residues 3– <dig> from the ca2+-bound s100a <dig>  with the ca2+-bound s100a4Δ8c , the s100a4Δ8c/miia1908- <dig> peptide complex  and the previously reported s100a4/miia1893- <dig> complex  were  <dig>  Å,  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å, respectively; indicating that neither myosin-iia binding, nor the c-terminal truncation, alters the overall conformation of the s100a <dig> dimer. the most significant differences were observed in the loop connecting helices  <dig> and  <dig> .

to examine myosin-iia peptide binding to s100a4Δ8c in solution, the miia1908- <dig> peptide used in crystallization studies was titrated into a 15n-labeled sample of ca2+-bound s100a4Δ8c. a comparison of these data to a similar titration performed with wild-type s100a <dig>  <cit>  revealed that of the  <dig> correlations shown previously to shift upon miia1908- <dig> binding to wild-type s100a <dig>   <dig> of these chemical shift perturbations were observed in titrations with s100a4Δ8c. these included residues in helix  <dig> , the pseudo-ef-hand , the hinge , helix  <dig> , the typical ef-hand , helix  <dig> , and the c-terminal tail . following the addition of the miia1908- <dig> peptide, differences in chemical shift were also observed in the 1h-15n correlations for ser <dig>  his <dig>  ser <dig>  phe <dig>  gly <dig>  leu <dig>  ala <dig>  glu <dig>  phe <dig>  gly <dig> and for phe <dig>  but these changes did not occur or were not the same as perturbations found in titrations with wild-type s100a <dig>  in addition, there were fewer overlapping 1h-15n correlations for the s100a4Δ8c/peptide complex since correlations arising from residues 94– <dig> were absent in this s100a <dig> construct. overall, these nmr data confirm that s100a4Δ8c binds the miia1908- <dig> peptide in a very similar structure/orientation in solution as observed for wild-type s100a <dig> 

crystal packing interactions
an examination of the crystal packing interactions for s100a4Δ8c shows that the c-terminal tail  of subunit a interacts with the hydrophobic cleft formed between helices  <dig> and  <dig> of the crystallographically related subunit b  and vice versa. these interactions result in the formation of rods of s100a <dig> dimers running parallel to the crystallographic b-axis for the ab subunits and parallel to the ab diagonal for the cd subunits . the inter-dimer contacts between the c-terminal tail of one s100a <dig> dimer and the target binding cleft of the symmetry related molecule are primarily mediated by phe <dig> and phe <dig> of the c-terminal tail, and residues phe <dig>  leu <dig>  phe <dig>  and leu <dig> in the hinge and helix  <dig> of the symmetry related molecule . a comparison of these s100a <dig> inter-dimer interactions with the s100a4/miia1893- <dig> structure  revealed that residues pro1927-val <dig> of the myosin-iia peptide adopt a similar type i β-turn as s100a <dig> residues glu88-glu <dig>  with phe <dig> and val <dig> residing deep within the hydrophobic cavity formed by the hinge and helix  <dig> . although the orientation of the s100a <dig> c-terminal helix  as it approaches the hydrophobic cleft is almost opposite to that of the myosin-iia peptide , the cα atoms for glu88-glu <dig> of s100a <dig> and pro1927-val <dig> of myosin-iia have an overall rms deviation of  <dig>  Å; demonstrating that when bound in the hydrophobic cleft, the c-terminal tail of s100a <dig> and myosin-iia present similar geometric and chemical features.

solution studies of a larger s100a4/miia1893- <dig> peptide complex
since miia1893- <dig> bound s100a <dig> with a higher affinity than miia1908- <dig> <cit> , and exhibited better spectral properties than miia1908- <dig>  we examined this longer peptide in nmr studies to further investigate the solution properties of the asymmetric binding mode observed for myosin-iia in the s100a4Δ8c/miia1908- <dig> complex. as expected for a complex with a dissociation constant in the nanomolar range, miia1893-1923-bound s100a <dig> exhibited resonances with slow exchange on the chemical shift timescale. this property resulted in spectra exhibiting narrow linewidths, which is consistent with little, if any, broadening contributions from intermediate exchange. the 1h-15n hsqc of the ca2+-s100a4/miia1893- <dig> complex showed that peak doubling occurred for approximately two-thirds of the observable 1h-15n correlations throughout all regions of the protein . the resonance doubling complicated the assignment of backbone and side chain resonances, but it was still possible to sequence-specifically assign all of the observed correlations using standard nmr techniques. the observed peak doubling is consistent with the binding mode of the shorter miia1908- <dig> peptide in our x-ray structure, in which peptide binding breaks the symmetry of the s100a <dig> dimer interface that is observed in the ca2+-bound s100a <dig>  resulting in two distinct electronic shielding environments for several residues.

a comparison of the 1h-15n hsqc spectra of the s100a4/miia1893- <dig> complex  to that of the ca2+-s100a <dig>  revealed that it was not possible to analyze the chemical shift perturbations due to the ambiguities that peak doubling introduced. to address this problem, a proxyl spin-label was covalently attached to the c-terminus of the miia1893- <dig> peptide and the distance-dependent effects  of paramagnetic relaxation were mapped onto the ca2+-s100a <dig> structure   <cit> . at the lowest concentration of miia1893-1923-cys-proxyl peptide , large reductions in cross-peak intensities were observed for residues in loop  <dig> , the beginning of helix  <dig>  and in the c-terminal loop . these relaxation effects, plus those observed at the next titration point , were consistent with the c-terminus of the miia1893- <dig> peptide being located near residues in helix  <dig> and the hinge . although the cross-peak intensities for residues arg <dig> and lys <dig> were also significantly reduced by low miia1893-1923-cys-proxyl peptide concentrations, their exact positions in the ca2+-s100a <dig> structure were uncertain since the c-terminal loop is mobile in solution. in addition, these residues were not observed in the ca2+-s100a <dig> x-ray structure  <cit> , which is consistent with high structural plasticity and dynamic behavior. other residues in ca2+-s100a <dig> were affected to a lesser degree, and only at higher concentrations of the spin-labeled peptide , including residues in helix  <dig> , loop  <dig> , the hinge , and helix  <dig> . however, data at higher spin-labeled peptide concentrations were interpreted cautiously because of the potential for outer sphere effects from free spin-labeled peptide  <cit> . altogether, these solution data support the asymmetric binding mode for the myosin-iia peptide and indicate that the peptide can bind in either of two orientations across the s100a <dig> dimer interface.

discussion
to date, structural studies of s100-target complexes have revealed a variety of binding modes with respect to target recognition, which are typically characterized by the formation of symmetric complexes with a 1:1 s <dig> subunit:target stoichiometry   <cit> . for s100b and s100a1-target complexes, target binding is primarily mediated by interactions with the hydrophobic cleft formed by helices  <dig> and  <dig> of the s <dig> protein, although the orientation of the target peptide within the hydrophobic cleft can vary significantly  <cit> . other target binding modes include interactions with helix  <dig> of one s <dig> subunit and helix 1′ of the second s <dig> subunit as observed for s100a <dig> and s100a11-target complexes  <cit> , and in the case of the s100a6/sip complex, target binding involves bidentate interactions with the hydrophobic cleft of one s <dig> subunit and helix 1′ of the second s <dig> subunit  <cit> . the structure of the s100a4Δ8c/miia1908- <dig> peptide complex demonstrates a fourth binding mode, in which the myosin-iia peptide binds asymmetrically across helices  <dig> and 4′ at the s100a <dig> dimer interface. asymmetric target binding is emerging as a common feature amongst the s <dig> protein family as this binding mode is also observed for ahnak bound to the s100a10/annexin a <dig> complex and smarca <dig> bound to the s100a10/annexin a <dig> complex  <cit> .

the recent structures of s100a <dig> bound to longer myosin-iia peptides have demonstrated that the n- and c-termini of the peptide insert into the hydrophobic clefts formed by helices  <dig> and  <dig> of each s100a <dig> subunit to mediate high affinity binding  <cit> ; however, our structural studies indicate that a significantly shorter myosin-iia peptide is sufficient to promote an asymmetric binding mode. a contributing factor to the asymmetric disposition of the myosin-iia peptide is that it makes contacts with dimer-related residues on helices  <dig> and 4′ of each s <dig> subunit. in particular, val <dig>  cys <dig> and met <dig> of each s100a <dig> subunit form interactions with myosin-iia that position the peptide nearly orthogonally across the dimer interface. our previous biochemical studies support the contribution of these residues to myosin-iia binding as substitution of cys <dig> with ala or ser reduces s100a <dig> binding to myosin-iia by 20- and 55-fold, respectively, and disrupts s100a4-mediated myosin-iia disassembly  <cit> .

in addition to crystallographic and biochemical data, nmr data supports a model in which residues  <dig> to  <dig> of the myosin-iia heavy chain represent the core sequence for s100a <dig> recognition. in this regard, we examined whether this small peptide was sufficient to induce what is termed the “final folding” event that occurs upon s <dig> protein-target complex formation  <cit> . we examined whether conformational exchange in s100a <dig>  which is observed in the absence of bound target, could be stabilized upon binding the miia1908- <dig> peptide. as found for other wild-type and mutant s <dig> proteins  <cit> , significant exchange broadening was observed in the ca2+-bound s100a4Δ8c. notably, this exchange broadening completely disappeared upon s100a4Δ8c/miia1908- <dig> complex formation . as with other s <dig> proteins, this behavior likely accounts for the higher ca2+-binding affinity observed for s100a <dig> when bound to miia1908- <dig> <cit> . this may be considered analogous to a “mini-folding” event in which target binding shifts the s100a <dig> equilibrium population from a highly dynamic, but weak ca2+-binding state to a high affinity ca2+ binding state that is composed of an s100a <dig> population with a narrower distribution of dynamic features. while the regulation of s100a <dig> protein dynamics upon target binding will be the subject of future studies, it is important to note that the miia1908- <dig> peptide represents the core of the s100a4/myosin-iia interaction since it is adequately sized and positioned to eliminate conformational exchange upon binding either s100a4Δ8c or wild-type protein  <cit> . importantly, as most target-free s <dig> proteins have a relatively low affinity for ca2+  this allows for numerous s <dig> proteins to exist at high cellular concentrations  without significantly depleting intracellular free levels and short-circuiting ca2+ oscillations. thus, reasonably high s100a <dig> levels  can be poised inside the cell as myosin-iia becomes available for complex formation and downstream cytoskeletal modulation.

an interesting feature of the s100a4/myosin-iia complex is that myosin-iia residues contributing to the coiled-coil interface also mediate s100a <dig> binding. these observations suggest a mechanism in which s100a <dig> binding induces partial unwinding of the myosin-iia coiled-coil, and thus promotes myosin-iia filament disassembly. the relatively low tm  of the myosin-iia rod   <cit> , and the relative instability of the coiled-coil region that encompasses the s100a <dig> binding site suggests that this region of the myosin-iia coiled-coil likely undergoes significant thermally-driven structural fluctuations   <cit> . modest fluctuations in the structure of the coiled-coil would allow initial docking of s100a <dig> onto a single myosin-iia polypeptide chain followed by partial wrapping of the myosin-iia heavy chain across the s100a <dig> dimer and further unzipping of the coiled-coil. the free myosin-iia heavy chain would then be available for subsequent capture by a second s100a <dig> dimer. although turbidity studies with short myosin-iia rod constructs  support a binding stoichiometry of one s100a <dig> dimer per myosin-iia polypeptide chain  <cit> ; sedimentation assays with longer myosin-iia rod constructs  have shown that a stoichiometry of one s100a <dig> dimer to two myosin-iia polypeptide chains  is sufficient to promote maximal filament disassembly  <cit> . while s100a <dig> binds with low nanomolar affinities to isolated myosin-iia peptides and short, relatively unstable myosin-iia rod constructs, binding to longer myosin-iia rods or full-length myosin-iia appears to be significantly weaker  <cit> . these observations suggest that the loss of energy due to myosin-iia heavy chain unzipping can modulate s100a <dig> binding affinity, as a significant fraction of the binding energy must be used to drive the dissociation of the two polypeptide chains in the myosin-iia rod. future studies directed at examining the requirement for the binding of one versus two s100a <dig> dimers per myosin-iia heavy chain dimer for coiled-coil unzipping, as well as the reduction in free energy that occurs during unzipping will require the use of longer and more stable myosin-iia coiled-coil constructs.

this proposed model of s100a4-mediated myosin-ii heavy chain unzipping is analogous to the binding of single-stranded dna binding protein and ribosomal protein s <dig> to single-stranded dna and rna segments, respectively, that transiently form during thermal breathing of the nucleic acid base pairs  <cit> . while the detailed mechanisms of polymer unzipping associated with these nucleic acid binding proteins will be different due to their multi-domain nature and/or oligomeric state, these biological systems provide a conceptual framework for considering the mechanism of s100a <dig> coiled-coil unzipping.

CONCLUSIONS
direct visualization of the s100a4/myosin-iia complex has defined the chemical determinants required for myosin-iia binding and the overall organization of the complex. these studies have identified residues 1908– <dig> of the myosin-iia heavy chain as a core sequence for formation of the s100a4/myosin-iia complex. moreover, these studies highlight the potential role of structural dynamics within the myosin-iia coiled-coil and s100a <dig> in mediating the ca2+-dependent s100a4/myosin-iia interaction.
