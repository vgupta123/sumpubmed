BACKGROUND
irrespective of the final destination, all integral membrane proteins are initially synthesized on ribosomes associated with the rough endoplasmic reticulum . the first step in the exit of newly synthesized proteins from the er, for subsequent trafficking to intacellular organelles or the cell surface, is the incorporation of nascent proteins is their incorporation into cop ii transport vesicles. initiated by the binding of gtp to the small gtpase sar <dig>  the association of other coat proteins  sec <dig> and sec <dig>  forms a pre-budding complex that yields a concave surface enriched in basic residues . initially thought to be a bulk flow process  <cit> , the efficient export of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum  is now thought to be a selective process  <cit> , whereby the sar1-sec23/ <dig> complex not only elicits membrane curvature, but also selectively enriches cargo proteins into the newly forming cop vesicle. several groups have identified specific amino acid sequences within the cytoplasmic domains of newly synthesized  proteins that act as called er export motifs . one identified er export motif consists of two adjacent bulky hydrophobic or aromatic residues, as seen in the ff motif of ergic <dig>  <cit>  or the vv motif in the nmda receptor  <cit> . the second class of er export motifs is characterized by two acidic residues separated by a variable amino acid . initially identified in the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein    <cit> . this motif is now found in other mammalian proteins, including potassium channels   the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator   <cit>  and the angiotensin ii receptor   <cit> . of note for vsv-g, an upstream tyrosine residue appears to enhance the activity of the di-acidic motif   <cit> .

lemur tyrosine kinase  <dig> , also known as brek, aatyk- <dig>  cdk <dig>  kpi- <dig> and cprk  <cit>  is a membrane anchored  <dig> amino acid serine/threonine kinase. lmtk <dig> is not highly expressed in the plasma membrane, but rather is present on intracellular vesicles, where it has multiple functions depending upon the cell type in which it is expressed. interestingly, although the molecular pathways between tissues differ, lmtk <dig> appears to play a role in regulating intracellular trafficking events. for example lmtk <dig> modulates the trafficking and surface expression of the cystic fibrosis ion channel, cftr, in airway cells  <cit> . similarly lmtk <dig> modulates the intracellular trafficking of the androgen receptor in prostate epithelia, where lmtk <dig> negatively regulates the expression of androgen dependent genes  <cit> . lmtk <dig> has also been shown to be involved in differentiation of tissues, where lmtk <dig> plays a role as a negative regulator of ngf-induced neuronal differentiation  <cit> . male lmtk <dig> knockout mice are infertile due to lack of development and differentiation of gonadal tissue  <cit> . several binding partners have been identified for lmtk <dig>  including myosin vi  <cit> , including pp1c  <cit>  and cdk5/p <dig>  <cit> . it is likely that lmtk <dig> works in concert with myosin vi to modulate the trafficking events observed in various tissues. moreover, the fact that lmtk <dig> is a kinase, and can also modulate the actions of phosphatases  <cit> , argues that lmtk <dig> may also be an important mediator, integrating several intracellular signaling and trafficking pathways. lmtk <dig> contains two hydrophobic domains, which anchor the kinase in lipid bilayers, with a short amino and long carboxyl tail that reside in the cytosol  <cit> ; it is within the long carboxyl tail that the catalytic activity of the kinase resides . although there is a clear role for lmtk <dig> in regulating endocytosis and recycling through its presence in endosomal membranes  <cit> , the pathways and mechanisms by which nascent lmtk <dig> exits the er and enters endosomes is not known. the initial step in the trafficking of any membrane protein to its final destination is its efficient export from the er. to this end, our results suggest that the di-acidic motif is a key determinant in the export of lmtk <dig> from the er. subsequently, it is likely that other, as yet undetermined, signals will be required for the final targeting of lmtk <dig> to its final endosomal destination.fig.  <dig> topology and location of the predicted er export motif in lmtk <dig>  a the kinase domain  and predicted er export motif  of lmtk <dig> are located on the cytosolic side of the er membrane. the location of the er export motif in the cytosol places it to interact with copii vesicle components . dmem, advanced dmem, dmem/f <dig>  penicillin, streptomycin, geneticin, lipofectamine  <dig> and alexa546-conjugated transferrin were all obtained from life technologies . pci vectors were from promega . fluorescent constructs were obtained from origene  and addgene . antibodies used were lmtk <dig> , tgn <dig> , eea <dig> , pdi , gapdh . secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit irdye 680rd conjugates , and all images were collected on a licor odyssey sa imager. for immunofluorescence microscopy, labeled secondary antibodies  were from jackson laboratories . all other reagents were obtained from sigma and were of reagent grade.

cell culture
cho cells  <cit>  were maintained in dmem/f <dig> , and hela cells in advanced dmem . all media was supplemented with 10 % fbs and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin, and cells grown in 5 % co <dig> at 37 °c. cell transfections were performed using lipofectamine 2000™ according to the manufacturer’s protocol. selection of stable cells was achieved by growing cells in media supplemented with 500 μg/ml geneticin for lmtk <dig> constructs, 100 μg/ml neomycin for memerald-tfr, and 3 mg/ml puromycin for lmtk <dig> sirna.

constructs for lmtk2
shrna against human lmtk <dig> was from origene  and contained a puromycin mammalian selection marker for stable selection. human lmtk <dig> was a generous gift from dr tadashi yamamoto  and was expressed in the pci vector. the lmtk <dig> a1110sa mutant  was generated using site-directed mutagenesis using the quikchange ii xl site-directed muagenesis kit . shrna resistant constructs were generated by introducing  <dig> silent mutations into the coding regions of wt and a1110sa lmtk <dig>  that overlapped with the recognition sequence of the shrna construct. lmtk <dig> constructs were transiently expressed.

immunofluorescence micoscopy
cells growing on coverslips to ~60 % confluence were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with  <dig>  % triton x- <dig>  blocked with 1 % bsa in pbs and processed for indirect immunofluorescence using primary antibodies as described in figure legends. secondary antibodies coupled to alexa-fluor- <dig> were used to visualize binding of the primary antibodies. cells were visualized with an olympus fluoview f10i confocal microscope . for transferrin uptake experiments, cells were starved in rpmi media containing  <dig>  % bsa for 2 h, loaded with 5 μg/ml alex-tf  in rpmi- <dig>  % bsa for 20 min at 37 °c, washed in pbs and fixed. to calculate a pearson’s coefficient, multiple randomly selected fields from several experiments were collected, and imagej software  used to evaluate signal overlap.

immunoblot analysis
cells were lysed in tgh buffer  and resolved by sds-page as previously described  <cit> . gapdh was used as a loading control. detection of primary antibody binding was performed using irdye-conjugated secondary antibodies  followed by visualization on an odyssey sa infrared imaging system .

facs analysis of transferring recycling
transferrin-uptake and recycling was performed as previously described  <cit> . cho cells stably expressing the human transferrin receptor  were subject to transient transfection with either wt or a1110sa lmtk <dig> . briefly, cells were incubated with transferrin coupled to alexa-fluor  <dig>  for 30 min at 4 °c followed by internalization at 37 °c in the continuous presence of tf-alexa-fluor 555). cells were then washed and incubated at 37 °c in media supplemented with 100 μg/ml unlabeled transferrin for 30 min before fixation with  <dig>  % pfa. cell associated tf-alexa-fluor  <dig> was determined by facs analysis using a bd lsrii flow cytometer .

subcellular fractination and organelle enrichment
enrichment of major intracellular organelles was performed using a self-generated iodixanol  density gradient. briefly, cells were homogenized in a sucrose-containing detergent-free buffer at 4 °c using and dounce-type homogenizer to maintain organelle integrity. the homogenate was subject to a series of low speed centrifugations to remove unbroken cells, nuclei, mitochondria and lipids to generate a post mitochondrial fraction. this fraction was adjusted to 20 %  optiprep and layered between  <dig> and 15 %  optiprep cushions. samples were subject to centrifugation  at 4 °c. fractions were collected from the top using a syringe and 25g needle. collected fractions were solubilized in laemmli sample buffer and resolved by sds-page on a 4-12 % bis-tris gradient gel . proteins were transferred to pvdf membranes and probed with appropriate antibodies.

RESULTS
lmtk <dig> contains potential acidic er export motifs
alignment of the sequences of various mammalian orthologs of lmtk <dig> revealed the presence of a canonical di-acidic motif in the distal portion of the c-terminal tail , irrespective of the overall length of each species lmtk <dig>  interestingly, as with the di-acidic export motif in vsv-g, a proximal upstream tyrosine residue is also seen. to explore the possible role acidic amino acids in the efficient export of lmtk <dig> from the er, we studied the trafficking of wild-type  and mutant lmtk <dig> , where we mutated the d1110se of sequence of wild-type lmtk <dig> to a1110sa.

co-localization of lmtk <dig> mutants with er markers
to investigate whether mutation of putative acidic er export signals affects the subcellular distribution of lmtk <dig>  hela cell lines expressing either wt or a1110sa lmtk <dig> were evaluated. endogenous lmtk <dig> was knocked down using a stable shrna against lmtk <dig> , scrambled shrna had no effect. shrna revealed a knockdown of ~80 % of endogenous lmtk <dig>  transient expression of shrna resistant wt and a1110sa lmtk <dig> revealed expression of both constructs. overexpression of shrna resistant wt lmtk <dig> was performed to rule out any expression artefacts, and to be able to more accurately compare wt and a1110sa lmtk <dig> localization. determination of the location of the endoplasmic reticulum was performed by transient co-expression of mfrp calreticulin . wt lmtk <dig> signal was observed in discrete puctate structures towards the periphery of the cells, with some signal also seen in the perinuclear region. in contrast, a1110sa-lmtk <dig> displayed a more prominent perinuclear staining pattern, with reduced peripheral vesicular staining. confirmation that the perinuclear staining overlapped with the endoplasmic reticulum, was determined by observing co-localization of a1110sa lmtk <dig> with the er marker calreticulin. a pearson co-efficient analysis revealed a significantly higher co-localization  between a1110sa lmtk <dig> and calreticulin, compared to wt lmtk <dig> and calreticulin, arguing for reduced er export of the a1110sa mutant compared to wt lmtk <dig> fig.  <dig> mutation of the di-acidic export motif causes retention of lmtk <dig> within the er. a hela cells stably expressing shrna against lmtk <dig> were transiently transfected with sirna resistant constructs for either wt lmtk <dig> or a1110sa lmtk <dig>  b following immunofluorescence labeling, lmtk <dig> was visualized with secondary antibodies conjugated to alexa  <dig> dyes  and calreticulin observed as the transiently expressed mrfp fusion protein . nuclei are stained blue using dapi. bar = 10 μm. c pearson’s coefficients were determined for hela cells by imaging at least  <dig> cells from three independent experiments, encompassing randomly selected fields of view. *p <  <dig>  for difference by student’s t-test




to further elucidate the relative subcellular distributions of wt and a1110sa lmtk <dig>  and to evaluate er retention of the a1110sa mutant, cells expressing wt or a1110sa lmtk <dig> were subject to homogenization in a dounce-type homogenizer in detergent-free buffer, to retain organellar integrity. post nuclear crude microsomes were subject to separation on a self-generating iodixanol  gradient medium. fractions containing enriched subcellular organelles were subject to immunoblot analysis. several antibodies for er markers , golgi , and endosomes  were used to probe the various fractions, as well as antibodies against lmtk <dig>  immunoblot analysis of fractions from the optiprep™ gradients revealed wt lmtk <dig> to be found predominantly towards the lighter fractions, with signal also co-fractionating with endosomal markers . a small signal was also identified in denser er fractions, consistent with the synthesis of lmtk <dig> as a membrane protein synthesized within the er. in contrast to wt lmtk <dig>  a1110sa lmtk <dig> displayed a shift in buoyant density away from lighter regions towards heavier and denser fractions. this was seen as a reduction in lmtk <dig> content from endosomal fractions and a greater preponderance of a1110sa lmtk <dig> in er enriched fractions compared to wt lmtk <dig>  no large steady-state levels of lmtk <dig> in tgn enriched fractions were observed.fig.  <dig> gradient fractionation of cellular organelles shows a retention of a1110sa lmtk <dig> within the er. hela cells expressing either wt lmtk <dig> of a1110sa lmtk <dig> were subject to homogenization in a detergent free buffer, using a dounce-type homogenizer. post-nuclear supernatants were applied to an optiprep™ gradient and resolved by centrifugation. a fractions were collected and proteins resolved by sds-page on a 4–12 % gradient gel prior to immunoblotting. b comparison of relative band intensities of lmtk <dig> in each fraction 



one study evaluating the role of acidic export motifs has suggested a tri-acidic sequence to be present in the inwardly rectifying potassium channel, kat <dig>  <cit> . since there is an acidic amino acid upstream of d <dig> at position d <dig>  we evaluated the possible role of this amino acid by constructing a triple asp → ala construct . transient expression of wt, a1110sa and ana1110sa lmtk <dig> was performed and co-expressed with mrfp-calreticulin . as before, wt lmtk <dig> was found in discrete punctate structures extending past the er into the cytoplasm. in contrast, both a1110sa and ana1110sa lmtk <dig> were observed predominantly in perinuclear regions, which overlapped with calreticulin staining. peason’s coefficient analysis  showed a significantly greater overlap between a1110sa and ana1110sa lmtk <dig> compared to wt lmtk <dig> . when the overlap of calreticulin with a1110sa and ana1110sa lmtk <dig> was compared however, no significant difference in localization between the two mutants was observed .fig.  <dig> lack of evidence for a tri-acidic export signal for lmtk <dig>  a cells stably expressing either wt, di-acidic mutants  or tri-acidic mutants  of lmtk <dig> , along with mrfp calreticulin , were fixed and imaged using immunofluorescence miscroscopy. nuclei are stained blue using dapi. bar = 10 μm. b pearson’s coefficients were determined for cells by imaging at least  <dig> cells from various randomly selected fields of view. *p <  <dig>  for difference by student’s t-test. n.s. = not significantly different



mutation of acidic export motifs increases the half-life of lmtk2
pulse-chase experiments were performed to determine the kinetic effects of the a1110sa mutation on lmtk <dig> degradation, and the life-time of the protein once it is formed . both proteins exhibited fairly short half-lives with t1/ <dig> for both constructs being less than 5 h. interestingly, the a1110sa mutation yielded a protein that exhibited a small but significant  increase in the stability of the protein, with wt lmtk <dig> having a half-life of ~ <dig>  h and a1110sa lmtk <dig> having a half-life of ~ <dig>  h.fig.  <dig> effect of er export motif mutations on protein half-life. a cells expressing either wt or a1110sa lmtk <dig> were subject to labeling with 35s met/cys to steady-state. cells were switched to 35s-free media and sampled at various time-points. lmtk <dig> was subject to immunoprecipitation and resolved by sds-page. a typical gel is shown. b analysis of three separate experiments yields half-lives of  <dig>  h for wt lmtk <dig>  and  <dig>  h for a1110sa lmtk <dig>  



mutation of acidic export motifs alters transferrin recycling
it has been previously shown that lmtk <dig> is involved in endosomal recycling  <cit> . we hypothesized that ablation of the er export signal for lmtk <dig> would reduce lmtk <dig> levels within endosomal membranes and yield a similar phenotype to lmtk <dig> knockdown. to test this hypothesis, cells were pulsed with fluorescently labeled transferrin to facilitate uptake of transferrin into endosomal components of the endosomal recycling complex . the erc is a perinuclear collection of tubule-vesicular membranes containing rab <dig>  <cit> . cho cells were utilized due to the absence of detectable lmtk <dig>  <cit> , which despite knock down in hela cells was still present. to evaluate the functional effects of lmtk <dig> er exit on transferring recycling, in the absence of a potentially confounding lmtk <dig> background, we elected to express wt and a1110sa in cho cells, along with the human transferrin receptor. to follow the uptake of transferrin in wt and a1110sa lmtk <dig> expressing cells, cells were pulsed for 20 min with fluorescently labeled transferrin . as shown in fig. 6a, in wt-lmtk <dig> expressing cells, internalized transferrin is present in the cell periphery, but also smaller amounts within a perinuclear region. in contrast, in a1110sa-lmtk <dig> expressing cells, transferrin was trapped within a swollen perinuclear recycling compartment. we used facs analysis to quantify the intracellular trafficking of transferrin in wt-lmtk <dig> and a1110sa-lmtk <dig> expressing cells . to determine if loss of lmtk <dig> from its appropriate cellular location inhibited recycling of transferrin we pulsed cells with fluorescently labeled transferrin, followed by a chase of 30 min in the presence of excess unlabeled transferrin to facilitate recycling. both wt- and a1110sa-lmtk <dig> expressing cells took up transferrin to similar levels . however, comparing the remaining amount of transferrin in cells, following a 30 min chase, revealed a small but consistent defect in transferrin recycling in a1110sa-lmtk <dig> expressing cells .fig.  <dig> loss of lmtk <dig> er export impairs transferrin recycling. a cells were loaded with tf-alexa-fluor  <dig> before fixation. images are confocal z-projections. bar 10 μm. b cells were starved of transferrin in serum free media for  <dig> mins, followed by exposure to fluorescently labeled transferrin  for  <dig> mins at 4 °c, followed by an additional  <dig> mins at 37 °c. cells were rinsed in tf-alexa  <dig> free media supplemented with unlabeled transferrin, and stained using antibodies against lmtk <dig> . red , blue . c flow cytometry shows the total amount of transferrin taken up by cells at time t = 0 min  and time t = 30 min chase . data are mean ± sd from three independent experiments. *p < <dig>  for difference between wt and a1110sa lmtk2



discussion
the role of lmtk <dig> in cells is just beginning to be unraveled, but appears to play important roles in ion channel trafficking  <cit> , androgen signaling in prostate cancer  <cit>  and neuro-degeneration  <cit> . we have previously shown that the long carboxyl tail, as well as the short amino terminus, of lmtk <dig> are located within the cytosol  <cit> . moreover, lmtk <dig> appears to be an important binding partner of other trafficking and signaling molecules, including myosin vi  <cit> , protein phosphatase 1/inhibitor  <dig>  <cit> , cftr  <cit> , and the androgen receptor  <cit> . given these manifold functions and accessory proteins, it is clear that the appropriate subcellular localization of lmtk <dig> is critical to its cellular physiology. as with all membrane proteins, lmtk <dig> is initially synthesized within the endoplasmic reticulum, prior to its export within copii coated vesicles. rather than bulk flow exit, many proteins contain key regions within their amino acid sequence that facilitate their efficient export from the er. di-acidic sequences have been shown to function as er export motifs in several membrane proteins . among such di-acidic sequences, the dxe sequence is the best characterized, in which both acidic acid residues are required. comparison of amino acid sequences from lmtk <dig> orthologs, we identified a stretch of amino acids containing a potential di-acidic export motif that is present in all species of lmtk <dig> identified. such amino acid identity conserved across various species is usually indicative of that site playing a key role in the function of the protein. moreover, the potential di-acidic motif is localized within the cytosolic domain of the protein, where it has the potential to interact with copii components.

normally lmtk <dig> is present within the endosomal compartment of cells, where it regulates trafficking events. mutation of the di-acidic code at asparate  <dig> and glutamate  <dig> to alanines caused a marked retention of lmtk <dig> within the er, as determined by colocalization with the er marker calreticulin. we documented such er retention by both immunofluorescence microscopy and by iodixanol enrichment of subcellular membrane compartments. the finding that ablation of a di-acidic code leads to er retention of lmtk <dig> is finding not confined to lmtk <dig>  but also observed in many other proteins bearing a di-acidic er export motif, including vesicular stomatitis virus protein g  <cit> , g protein coupled receptors  <cit> , potassium channels  <cit> , and anion channels  <cit> . a small amount of mutant lmtk <dig> is likely to undergo export from the er, as the di-acidic signal facilitates efficient er export, rather than an all or none signal; thus bulk flow export continues unimpeded. we were unable to completely ablate er export of lmtk <dig> through mutation of the acidic code, however this is also true for mutation of the di-acidic code in many other proteins, including cftr  <cit> , the task- <dig> potassium channel  <cit>  and ergic- <dig>  <cit> . the inability to completely knock out er export, may be due to several reasons. for example, in addition to the di-acidic code, other signals may also be present in proteins. in several cases, this is due to a tyrosine residue. for example, a conserved tyrosine residue in the transmembrane domain of casp is needed for its export from the er to the golgi  <cit> . in plants, mutation of the tyrosine residue alone in casp does not impair er export, however it can support a degree of er export in the absence of the di-acidic code  <cit> . in the present manuscript we did not focus on the potential role of tyrosine residues. in addition, it is unlikely that we were able to completely knock down lmtk <dig> using shrna. thus there is likely some residual endogenous lmtk <dig> that is still present and confounding our data. nonetheless, despite the observation that we were not able to have complete colocalization of a1110sa lmtk <dig>  our results were nonetheless consistent in showing a significant difference between wt and mutant lmtk <dig>  moreover, the consistency in our findings using two independent methologies  supports the notion that our results are valid. although we have not formally ruled out any major structural changes associated with our mutagenesis, the fact that the ex export motif is considerably downstream to the catalytic domain and membrane spanning regions suggests that the protein may fold appropriately. if this is the case, the protein should not be major substrate for erad, and could accumulate rather than being degraded. this being the case, we might anticipate that the overall half-life of the protein would be increased. indeed, this appears to be the case for the anion channel cftr, where blockade of its er export  leads to a small but clear increase in cftr stability  <cit> .

the functional consequences of our preventing the efficient er export of lmtk <dig> are reminiscent of studies reducing endosomal lmtk <dig> through sirna mediated knock down of lmtk <dig>  <cit> . thus although a1110sa lmtk <dig> is functionally intact  the lack of protein in appropriate endosomal regions, due to er retention, affects membrane trafficking. loss of endosomal lmtk <dig> has no marked impact upon transferrin endocytosis, a finding also seen for lmtk <dig> knock down  <cit> . however the efficient recycling and loss of transferrin from the cell is impeded in a1110sa lmtk <dig> expressing cells. although not a complete loss of transferrin recycling, inhibition of lmtk <dig> export resulted in a similar degree of transferrin retention as that observed for rnai knockdown of lmtk <dig>  <cit> . although some studies have suggested that blocking tfr delivery from early endosomes to the erc might increase a direct fast recycling pathway  <cit> , knock down of total lmtk <dig> does not induce such a pathway  <cit> ; thus it is unlikely that such a pathway would be induced when endosomal lmtk <dig> levels are depleted through inhibition of efficient er export. whilst the first step in targeting lmtk <dig> to endosomal compartments of necessity is the export of membrane anchored lmtk <dig> from the er, it is likely that other signals  are responsible for post er trafficking of lmtk <dig> to endosomes; such signals remain to be identified. thus, the di-acidic motif is likely only required to allow lmtk <dig> to exit the er efficiently.

here, we have established that efficient anterograde tranposer of lmtk <dig>  from the site of its synthesis in the er to its destination in endosomal compartments, requires an acidic er export motif for its initial exit from the er. lmtk <dig> plays an important role in modulating the physiological function of a number of organs, including the airways  <cit> , prostate gland  <cit>  and brain  <cit> , as well as in the development of various human cancers  <cit> . as we begin to elucidate the cellular and organismal physiology of lmtk <dig>  lmtk <dig> may provide a novel target for the treatment of human diseases in which lmtk <dig> is involved.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results provide evidence for the presence of a di-acidic er export motif in lmtk <dig>  and provide evidence that the export of lmtk <dig> from the er occurs through a selective mechanism. since lmtk <dig> plays a pivotal role in a number of human diseases, targeting lmtk <dig> and its trafficking may provide a novel foundation for designing drugs to treat diseases impacted by lmtk <dig>
