BACKGROUND
hypoxia-inducible factors  are highly conserved proteins, found in a wide range of animals, that mediate a variety of adaptive cellular and systemic responses to hypoxia by upregulating the expression of more than  <dig> different genes  <cit>  to assist animals in their adaptation and survival. hif is a heterodimeric dna-binding complex consisting of α and β  subunits which are members of the bhlh-pas  superfamily of proteins  <cit> . in mammals, three types of hif-α s  have been reported , amongst which the hif-1α is believed to be the principal regulator of oxygen homeostasis, which heterodimerizes with arnt and binds to the hypoxia-responsive elements  of numerous hypoxia-inducible genes to trigger their expression  <cit> . the increase in hif- <dig> activity is primarily due to the hypoxia-induced stabilization and activation of the hif-1α subunit which is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system under normoxic conditions  <cit> . this process is activated by the hydroxylation of two conserved proline residues  within the oxygen-dependent degradation  domain of hif-1α by oxygen-dependent prolyl- <dig> hydroxylases   <cit> . hydroxylation of these proline residues increases the affinity of hif-1α for the von hippel lindau tumor suppressor  protein, which is part of an e <dig> ubiquitin-ligase complex that targets the protein for proteasomal degradation  <cit> . moreover, hydroxylation of a conserved asparagine residue  within the hif-1α c-terminal activation domain by an asparaginyl hydroxylase, known as factor inhibiting hif- <dig> , under normoxic conditions inhibits the recruitment of the cbp/p <dig> coactivator, an important component for hif-dependent transcriptional activation  <cit> .

fish are ideal models to study molecular and cellular adaptation to hypoxia because fluctuations in environmental oxygen availability have played an important role in the evolution of these animals  <cit> . indeed, compared to mammals, the chronic and protective responses to hypoxia in fish are considerably more diverse  <cit> . although hif-1α and hif-2α cdnas have been described in rainbow trout  <cit>  and atlantic killifish  <cit> , respectively, the presence and function of these molecules in cyprinids, which are generally hypoxia-tolerant, has previously not been studied in detail, although sequences of zebrafish hifs are available.

in order to obtain broader insights into the evolution and possible functions of the hif-αs in fish, we have identified and characterized two distinct hif-α isoforms – gchif-1α and gchif-4α – from the hypoxia-tolerant grass carp. here, we present evidence for the differential roles of these two hif-α proteins in grass carp for adaptation to hypoxia based on their in vivo expression and response patterns to short- and long-term hypoxia, and in vitro gene transactivation studies. moreover, parsimony analysis  support the notion that hif-4α  is possibly an ortholog of the mammalian hif-3α.

RESULTS
identification and cloning of full-length gchif-1α and gchif-4α cdnas
in an attempt to isolate hif-α-like cdna sequences from grass carp, degenerated primers targeting consensus sequences derived from multiple alignment of the bhlh/pas domains of human , cow , rat  and rainbow trout  hif-1α s were used in rt-pcr on total rna from kidney of grass carp that was exposed to  <dig> h hypoxia. two distinct cdna fragments, c <dig>  and c <dig> , with partial open reading frames  that shared high sequence identity with the hif-α proteins  of various vertebrates species were identified. using 5' – and 3' -race pcr, full-length cdnas were derived for c <dig>  and c <dig> , the authenticity of which were confirmed by full-length rt-pcr on poly + rna isolated from grass carp kidney, and were cloned into the pgem-t plasmid vector to produce the corresponding full-length cdna clones, sl <dig> and sl <dig> . the clones were completely sequenced on both strands and computer analyses indicated that sl <dig> contains 5' – and 3' -untranslated  regions of  <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively, and an orf that specifies a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a predicted mr of  <dig> kda, and is consistent with the detection of a single mrna transcript of ca.  <dig>  kb by northern blot analysis . sl <dig> contains 5' – and 3' -ut regions of  <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively, and an orf that encodes for a protein of  <dig> amino acids with a predicted mr of  <dig> kda. northern blot analysis using either the 5' -ut or 3' -end  sequences of sl <dig> as probes indicated that sl <dig> is expressed in two forms in hypoxic kidney, a major  <dig> -kb transcript and a minor  <dig> -kb transcript; with the larger transcript showing a 10-fold higher expression level than the former .

database searches using blastx showed that the orf of sl <dig> shares high amino acid identity with the hif-1α s of human , cow , rat  and rainbow trout , and moderate  to low  sequence identity with other hif-α proteins from various vertebrate species. moreover, the primary structure of the deduced protein of sl <dig> contains the characteristic bhlh, pas-a/b, n-tad and c-tad domains  that are highly similar to homologous domains in the human and rainbow trout hif-1α proteins . taken together, these data indicated that sl <dig> encodes for the grass carp hif-1α protein, hereupon designated as gchif-1α. in contrast, blast analysis of the orf of sl <dig> showed that it shares an equivalent degree of sequence identity  with the hif-1α, hif-2α and hif-3α proteins from different animal species; which suggests that sl <dig> does not belong to any of the known hif-α subtypes documented thus far. furthermore, although the deduced sl <dig> protein contains the characteristic bhlh, pas-a/b, pac and n-tad domains, the amino acid sequence at the c-terminal end is highly divergent from those of the hif-1α, hif-2α and hif-3α proteins . overall, primary sequence analyses indicated that sl <dig> highly likely encodes for a novel hif-α protein, hereupon designated as gchif-4α.

characteristics of the deduced gchif-1α and gchif-4α proteins
sequence alignment of the deduced gchif-1α and gchif-4α proteins with the rainbow trout hif-1α , fundulus hif-2α  and human hif-1α, -2α and -3α proteins indicated extensive sequence similarity in the bhlh, pas-a/b, pac and n-tad domains . importantly, several functionally important sequence motifs  described in all known members of the hif-α protein family are also found in the gchif-1α and gchif-4α deduced proteins. they include : the n-terminal nuclear localization signal  that mediates nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of the hif-α protein  <cit> ; proline- <dig> residue, a critical hydroxylation site that mediates hif-1α degradation under normoxia  <cit> ; pro- <dig>  tyr- <dig> and ile- <dig> which are highly conserved in the pvhl recognition sequence pyixxdddfxl  within the n-tad domain  <cit>  that control ubiquitin/proteasome degradation of hif-1α under normoxic conditions  <cit> ; and leu- <dig>  a molecular determinant of pro- <dig> hydroxylation that modulates oxygen-dependent proteolysis of hif-1α  <cit> . moreover, gchif-1α shares remarkably high sequence similarity with the human hif-1α and -2α proteins in the c-tad region, in particular the leucine-rich hydrophobic domain encompassing asn- <dig> , and leu- <dig>  cys- <dig>  leu- <dig> and leu- <dig> residues which are required for physical interaction of the hif-α protein with the cbp/p <dig> transactivators  <cit>  to activate hif- <dig> transcriptional activity  <cit> . in addition, val- <dig>  which correctly positions asn- <dig> in hif-1α for hydroxylation by the asparagine hydroxylase enzyme  <cit> , is also conserved in gchif-1α. in contrast, gchif-4α shares very little sequence identity in its c-terminal region with the c-tads of human hif-1α, -2α or -3α . curiously, gchif-4α contains a stretch of glutamic acid-rich region  that is not found in the hif-1α, -2α or -3α deduced proteins .

phylogenetic analysis
in order to obtain additional hif-α homologues from other fish species for phylogenetic analysis, the fugu rubripes  genome  <cit> , medaka  genome  <cit> , genbank/embl and zebrafish est databases  <cit>  were queried using tblastn. three distinct hif-α-like proteins were identified from the fugu genome: one  shared 71% and 81% sequence identity with the human and rainbow trout hif-1α, respectively; the second  shared 76% and 81% identity with the human and fundulus hif-2α, respectively; and the third  shared 71% identity with gchif-4α. similarly, three distinct hif-α-like proteins were found in zebrafish: one  shared 77% identity with human hif-1α; the second  shared 79–80% identity with the mammalian hif-2α s; and the third  shared 90% identity with gchif-4α. based on amino acid identity, putative hif-1α homologues from scaleless carp  and grouper  were also identified by database search for comparative analysis. interestingly, we were unable to identify any hif-3α-like isoforms in fish. likewise, in silico analysis of the genome sequences of a number of mammalian species  in the genbank database failed to turn up any hif-4α-like sequences.

because the different hif-α subtypes share high sequence conservation in the n-terminal bhlh-pas domain but are highly divergent in the c-terminal region, only the bhlh-pas sequences of the hif-α s, arnt <dig> and arnt <dig> proteins from various vertebrate species were multiply aligned for phylogenetic analysis. using the caenorhabditis elegans aha protein as outgroup, a maximum parsimony tree was constructed  using the phylip package  <cit> . as shown in fig.  <dig>  two closely-related subclades of hif-1α s  – one consisting of avian, xenopus and mammalian hif-1α s and the second consisting exclusively of fish hif-1α homologues – were obtained. as expected, the hif-1α clade is shown to be more closely related to the hif-2α  than the hif-3α and hif-4α clades. most intriguingly, the putative hif-4α proteins from six different fish species formed a distinct clade  which is phylogenetically more similar to the mammalian hif-3α s  than to other hif-α proteins. phylogenetic analysis using the neighbor-joining method also produced a tree of the same topology with similarly high bootstrap scores .

in vivo expression and response patterns of gchif-1α and gchif-4α to short- and long-term hypoxia
to examine the in vivo expression and response patterns of gchif-1α and gchif-4α to hypoxia, grass carps were exposed to normoxic  and hypoxic  conditions and fish  were sampled from each treatment group and control after  <dig> and  <dig> h. total rna was isolated from seven different tissues of each of five fish from the normoxic and hypoxic groups at each time point for northern blot analysis. overall, normoxic expression and hypoxic induction patterns of the gchif-1α and gchif-4α genes were consistent amongst the replicate blots derived from different fish tissues, and a representative autoradiogram is shown in fig.  <dig>  under normoxic conditions, the  <dig> -kb gchif-1α mrna transcript was expressed most abundantly in eye and kidney; with lower expression levels being detected in brain, gill, heart and liver; and negligible expression in muscle. in contrast, the  <dig> -kb gchif-4α transcript was expressed at comparatively higher levels in brain, heart, kidney, liver and muscle relative to gchif-1α under similar conditions. a marked increase in gchif-1α expression was observed in gill and kidney after exposure to hypoxia for  <dig> h ; while gchif-1α expression was seemingly downregulated in brain, heart and liver, and appeared unchanged in eye. this is in sharp contrast to observations in rainbow trout  <cit>  and mammals  <cit>  where hif-1α mrna levels are unaffected by hypoxia. interestingly, gchif-4α  was markedly upregulated following exposure to hypoxia for  <dig> and  <dig> h in eye, gill, heart, kidney, liver and muscle. curiously, although the less abundant  <dig> -kb gchif-4α transcript showed prominent expression and hypoxic up-regulation  in kidney; expression of this smaller gchif-4α transcript was barely detectable in all other tissues examined under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions .

expression levels of gchif-1α and gchif-4α in all replicates of each hypoxic tissue were normalized against 28s rrna and compared with the normoxic counterpart. if expression levels were the same in both the hypoxia treatment and normoxia control groups, the hypoxia:normoxia expression ratio should theoretically be equal to 1; whereas the ratio is expected to be significantly greater than  <dig> if hypoxic induction of the genes was observed. the 4- and 96-h datasets of each tissue were lumped and a non-parametric χ <dig> test was performed to test the null hypothesis that the hypoxia:normoxia expression ratio was not significantly different from  <dig>  <cit> . the analysis indicated that while gchif-1α expression was significantly higher in hypoxic kidney as compared to the normoxic control , hypoxic induction of gchif-4α was found to be comparatively higher in eye, gill, heart, kidney and liver .

western blot analysis of gchif-1α and gchif-4α
to investigate the endogenous gchif-1α and gchif-4α protein levels in grass carp liver in normoxia and hypoxia, liver extracts from fish exposed to  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h of hypoxia were analysed by western blotting using gchif-1α –  and gchif-4α-specific  rabbit antisera. the specificity of these polyclonal antibodies was confirmed using in-vitro-transcribed and -translated gchif-1α and gchif-4α proteins which were detected as 86-kda and 72-kda protein bands, respectively . no cross reactivity was observed with the ab- <dig> and ab- <dig> antibodies on gchif-4α and gchif-1α, respectively .

as shown in fig. 5b, the ab- <dig> and ab- <dig> antibodies each detected at least two protein bands in the fish liver extracts, which most likely correspond to post-translationally-modified  forms of the respective gchif-α proteins. interestingly, gchif-1α is clearly detectable in the liver of normoxic grass carp  and is increased by ca.  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, respectively, following exposure to  <dig> h and  <dig> h of hypoxia. this is in striking contrast to previous observations in mouse  <cit>  and rainbow trout  <cit>  where hif-1α is not detectable in liver  under normoxic conditions due to rapid proteasomal degradation of the protein. as for the gchif-4α protein, its expression was also evident in grass carp liver under normoxic conditions, and showed a steady increase following exposure to  <dig> h  and  <dig> h  of hypoxia.

induction of p4-luc reporter expression by gchif-1α and gchif-4α in cho cells
to compare the transcriptional activity of gchif-1α and gchif-4α, cho-k <dig> c <dig>  cells were cotransfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the human epo hre element together with expression vectors for either gchif-1α or gchif-4α followed by exposure to normoxia or hypoxia. as shown in fig.  <dig>  luciferase activity in cells transfected with the pbk-cmvgchif-1α expression vector showed ca.  <dig> -fold increase while cells transfected with pbk-cmvgchif-4α showed a 50% decrease in activity, respectively, when compared to cells transfected with the empty pbk-cmv vector . interestingly, coexpression of pbk-cmvgchif-4α markedly reduced the transcriptional activity of pbk-cmvgchif-1α by more than 5-fold , suggesting that gchif-1α may be competitively inhibited by gchif-4α. to examine whether the reduction in gchif- <dig> activity by gchif-4α may be attributed to limiting amounts of endogenous arnt; a gcarnt2b expression plasmid was cotransfected into cho cells together with pbk-cmvgchif-1α and/or pbk-cmvgchif-4α. while the transfection of gcarnt2b alone showed no stimulatory effect on the hre-luciferase reporter gene, cells cotransfected with gcarnt2b and gchif-1α or gchif-4α showed ca. 7-fold and 5-fold increase in luciferase activity, respectively , relative to the empty vector. overall, the induction of luciferase activity was consistently higher in the gchif-1α – than gchif-4α-transfected cells . cells cotransfected with gchif-1α, gchif-4α and gcarnt2b also showed a marked increase in luciferase activity as compared to the empty vector control . overall, no significant difference in luciferase activity was observed between normoxic and hypoxic gchif-α-transfected cells.

discussion
we have identified and characterized the expression pattern and transcriptional activity of two distinct hif-α isoforms – gchif-1α and gchif-4α – from the grass carp. to our knowledge, the present study is the first to report the cloning and comparative analysis of two hif-α isoforms from a hypoxia-tolerant fish species. the open reading frames  of gchif-1α and gchif-4α are  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp in length, and encode proteins of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively. high sequence conservation is observed in the n-terminal portion of these two proteins which contain all of the characteristic motifs typical of hif-α proteins including: the basic helix-loop-helix  domain; n-terminal nuclear localization signal ; per-sim-arnt -a and -b domains; pas-associated c-terminal  domain; oxygen-dependent degradation  domain; and n-terminal transactivation  domain . sequence comparison showed that while gchif-1α is most similar to known hif-1α s  from different vertebrate species, gchif-4α showed an equivalent degree  of sequence identity in the n-terminal bhlh and pas domains  with the hif-1α, hif-2α and hif-3α proteins so far described, which led us to believe that gchif-4α is a novel hif-α isoform.

although the c-terminal region of gchif-4α is poorly conserved in comparison with other vertebrate hif-α s , the fact that it is capable of activating hre-driven transcription of the luciferase gene  suggests that it probably contains an atypical transactivation domain with properties distinct from that of the ctads of hif-1α, -2α and -3α. traditionally, transcription factors have been classified according to the prevalence of certain amino acids in the activation domains such as glutamine-rich, proline-rich and acidic-classes  <cit> . analysis of the c-terminal region of gchif-4α  showed that it is significantly more acidic  than that of hif-1α , hif-2α  and hif-3α , which suggests that gchif-4α likely contains an acidic activation domain. however, further experiments are needed to further characterize and map the functional activation domain of this region.

using northern hybridization, we demonstrated that gchif-1α is expressed as a single  <dig> -kb transcript while gchif-4α is expressed in two forms – a major  <dig> -kb transcript and a minor  <dig> -kb transcript. we speculated that the two gchif-4α mrna transcripts are generated either through the use of alternative transcriptional start sites or polyadenylation sites although numerous attempts at using 5' – and 3' -race, and degenerate rt-pcr to identify an alternatively spliced variant of gchif-4α  have been unsuccessful. nonetheless, it was demonstrated that the major  <dig> -kb gchif-4α transcript is ubiquitously expressed in a wide variety of fish tissues in normoxia, albeit at varying levels, and differs from gchif-1α which exhibited a more restricted expression profile . additionally, the response pattern to hypoxia also differs substantially between the two genes whereby gchif-4α expression is markedly upregulated in eye, gill, heart, kidney, liver and white muscle following exposure to short-  and long-term  hypoxia, while gchif-1α expression was only marginally upregulated in gill and kidney at  <dig> h  hypoxia . these findings indicated that gchif-1α expression and its regulation is markedly different from its counterparts in hypoxia-sensitive animal species such as rainbow trout  <cit> , mouse, rat and human  <cit>  where hif-1α is ubiquitously expressed and at a constant level under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. on the other hand, increases in endogenous gchif-1α protein levels in liver of hypoxic fish  suggest that ghif-1α may be stabilized  under hypoxic conditions in a manner similar to mammalian hif-1α  <cit> . overall, the differential expression and regulation patterns of gchif-1α and gchif-4α at the mrna and protein levels indicate that both genes play very specialized roles in different fish organs in normoxia and are essential for tissue response to short-  and long-term  hypoxia in grass carp.

to explore whether a hif-4α subtype exist in mammals, tblastn search of the genome sequences and est databases of all available mammalian species  was performed and a number of hits  were obtained. however, closer inspection indicated that the clones encode for different members of the bhlh-pas superfamily of proteins such as hif-1α, hif-2α, hif-3α, arnt, ahr, clock, sim <dig>  sim <dig> and various mop isoforms, and none showed any significant similarity to the c-terminal region of gchif-4α. based on this, we believe that hif-4α is probably not found in mammals and highly likely a novel isoform specific to fish. conversely, hif-3α has thus far only been reported in mammals and bioinformatic searches of several fish  genome and est databases  also failed to turn up any hif-3α-like sequence, which suggest that hif-3α may not be present in the genomes of fish. interestingly, parsimony analysis of  <dig> hif-α and  <dig> arnt proteins from different animal species indicated that the putative hif-4α s from fish form a distinct clade that is phylogenetically more closely related to the mammalian hif-3α s  than to either the hif-1α or hif-2α proteins . this raises the intriguing possibility that hif-3α and hif-4α are probably orthologs that may have arisen following lineage divergence between mammals and fish some 350– <dig> million years ago  <cit> .

there are a number of similarities  between gchif-4α and mammalian hif-3α which are in line with this notion. first, expression of gchif-4α  and mammalian hif-3α  <cit>  is not only evident under normoxic conditions in tissues such as brain, heart, kidney and liver, but the mrna levels are also markedly upregulated in these same tissues in fish and rat, respectively, in response to hypoxia. in a related series of experiments, we have observed  that vegf-a mrna levels in grass carp are also significantly upregulated in brain, heart, kidney and liver tissues upon exposure to hypoxia for  <dig> h which indicated that the hif system has indeed been activated under these conditions . most intriguingly, the increase in vegf-a mrna levels correlated with the hypoxic increase in gchif-4α  mrna levels in the same tissues . these results are consistent with the notion that the function of gchif-4α, and the mechanism regulating its expression in grass carp, may be similar to that of hif-3α in mammals, which purportedly represents a rapidly responding hif system to short-term tissue hypoxia  <cit> .

independent evidence supporting the functional similarity of gchif-4α to hif-3α is provided by hre-luciferase reporter gene activation studies in which overexpression of gchif-4α was found to attenuate the transcriptional activity of gchif-1α in cho cells ; a phenomenon analogous to the suppressive effect of hif-3α on hif- <dig> activity in mammalian cells  <cit> . whether the suppression by gchif-4α is due to its competition with gchif-1α for arnt or other bhlh-pas dimerization partners such as clif  <cit>  and mop  <cit> ; or its direct binding to hif-1α similar to the inhibitory pas  protein which prevents the nuclear import of hif-1α and its subsequent binding to the hres of downstream target genes  <cit> , is presently not known. on the other hand, it was observed that when cotransfected with arnt, gchif-4α  and mammalian hif-3α  <cit>  are each able to activate hre-driven transcription, indicating that both are capable of operating as weak transcription factors. these observations suggest that gchif-4α, similar to hif-3α, may play a dual regulatory role as a transcriptional activator  or repressor , depending on the availability of compatible arnt molecules .

it is recognized that the enhancement of transcriptional activation is dependent upon the stability and translocation of specific hif-α proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and their subsequent binding to the hres of target genes  <cit> ; and a key factor modulating these processes is the intracellular redox state  <cit> . recently, it has been shown that the stability and dna-binding activity of rainbow trout hif-1α  is regulated by a redox mechanism  <cit>  very similar to the mammalian hif-2α  <cit> , whereby the redox sensitivity of both proteins was attributed to the cys <dig> residue in the rthif-1α  protein. changing the ser <dig> residue to cys <dig> by site-directed mutagenesis in mammalian hif-1α rendered its dna-binding activity redox sensitive  <cit> . interestingly, the amino acid at position  <dig> of gchif-1α and gchif-4α are, respectively, ser <dig> and cys <dig> , suggesting that the stability and dna-binding activity of both proteins may be differentially sensitive to redox states. conceivably, redox regulation through sulfhydryl modifications of cysteine residues could also potentially occur in the c-terminal transactivation domain, wherein the redox-sensitive residues may affect both the stability and activity of the protein  <cit> . whether these aspects of gchif-1α and gchif-4α are regulated by cellular redox states in the grass carp will need to be elucidated in future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that there are at least two distinct hif-α isoforms – gchif-1α and gchif-4α – in the hypoxia-tolerant grass carp and that they are differentially expressed and regulated in grass carp in response to hypoxic stress in different fish organs. our findings suggest that unique molecular mechanisms operate through these two hif-α isoforms, which underpin the hypoxic response in the hypoxia-tolerant grass carp. however, the in vivo functions of gchif-1α and gchif-4α remains to be elucidated, and experiments are underway in our laboratory to compare their stability, nucleocytoplasmic distribution and dna binding specificity to the hres of hypoxia-inducible genes such as gcglutx  <cit> , gccited  <cit>  and gcvegf-a  <cit>  in grass carp using the chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. in addition, a comparison of gchif-4α with the corresponding orthologues in hypoxia-sensitive fish species such as rainbow trout would provide further insights into the role of this novel isoform in hypoxia tolerance mechanisms in fish.

the full-length cdna sequences of gchif-1α and gchif-4α have been deposited in the genbank database under accession numbers , respectively.
