BACKGROUND
bone morphogenetic protein  signaling plays diverse and essential roles during development of numerous organ systems such as the heart  <cit> , lung  <cit>  and kidney  <cit> . signaling is initiated when ligands bind cell surface serine threonine kinase receptors that in their turn phosphorylate the receptor associated transcription factors smad  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   <cit> . phosphorylated r-smads associate with the common smad, smad <dig> and are translocated into the nucleus where they bind dna in association with other factors. transcriptional outcomes are determined by association with general transcriptional activators such as p <dig> and cbp  <cit> , or by association with repressors such as suv39h  <cit>  or ctbp  <cit> . the smad binding element , gtct and the gc-rich consensus motif gncgcc  <cit> , confer relatively low affinity and specificity to the smad:dna interaction, necessitating association with other transcription factors such as zfp <dig>   <cit>  for efficient dna binding. interestingly, this combinatorial requirement for binding can be bypassed by concatamerizing the basic smad binding motifs. this approach has been successful in generating synthetic genes for use as signaling reporters in vitro  <cit> . the immediate early bmp response gene id <dig> has been of particular interest as its promoter region contains a natural concatamer of smad binding motifs  <cit> , potentially enabling its activation through smad binding alone. this natural concatamer, known as the bmp responsive element  has been used to generate both an in vitro bmp reporter  <cit>  and in vivo reporters  <cit> .

although cellular targets for bmp signaling have been defined in some developing tissues by conditional inactivation of bmp receptors  <cit>  and smad transcription factors  <cit> , the full complement of cellular targets of bmp signaling in many organ systems is not known. to further clarify which cells respond transcriptionally to smad mediated bmp signals during mouse organogenesis, we have generated a novel in vivo reporter by cloning a concatamer of the id <dig> bre upstream of the heat shock protein 1a  promoter fused to β-galactosidase cdna  <cit> . we find that β-galactosidase expression is regulated by bmps in vitro, and can show by comparison with staining for nuclear phosphorylated smad  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that domains of bmp pathway activation can be recapitulated in all organs studied. in the kidney, we find that the bmp signaling pathway is highly activated in collecting ducts, developing nephron tubules and glomeruli, but surprisingly it is inactive in the nephron progenitor cell population, which is thought to respond to bmp signaling. reporter gene activation is faithfully maintained in organ culture, confirming the versatility of this mouse strain for studies of organogenesis. taken together, our study augments the current understanding of smad dependent bmp signaling during kidney development by identifying cellular targets.

RESULTS
the bre-hspa1a-lacz  transgenic reporter strain
to generate a mouse in which cells responding to bmp signaling are labeled by β-galactosidase expression, we derived a transgenic strain using a construct containing a concatamerized smad1/5/ <dig> binding site from the mouse id <dig> gene  <cit> , upstream of the hspa1a promoter  fused to the β-galactosidase cdna followed by an sv <dig> polyadenylation signal  <cit>  . the bmp responsive cis-regulatory element has previously been successfully used to generate an in vitro bmp transcriptional reporter for use in cell culture  <cit> , and an in vivo bmp reporter for early mouse development  <cit> . both of these reporters employ the adenovirus major late promoter. for organogenesis studies, we chose the hspa1a promoter as its high fidelity during development of diverse organ systems is well documented  <cit> . furthermore, the hspa1a-lacz fusion construct has previously been successfully used to generate an in vivo reporter for retinoic acid signaling  <cit> . the hspa1a promoter alone does not drive tissue specific expression, but does contain a heat shock element, causing ubiquitous activation of the reporter at 42°c  <cit> . uniquely, therefore, the transgene can be heat induced in cells in which β-galactosidase is not expressed, to control for transcriptional silencing of the transgene.

to allow screening for transgenic reporters with high signal strength, we chose to derive transgenic mice from embryonic stem cells  rather than using pronuclear injection. to evaluate the frequency in our experimental system of β-galactosidase activation caused by positional activation of the reporter gene, we performed a parallel control experiment in which hspa1a-lacz was electroporated into es cells with the pgk-neor cassette, and drug resistant clones were assayed for reporter gene expression following bmp <dig> treatment. of  <dig> drug resistant colonies screened, one was found to express β-galactosidase, indicating that the frequency of confounding constitutively β-galactosidase expressing clones was less than 2%. after selecting drug resistant escs coelectroporated with linearized bre-hspa1a-lacz and selection cassette, individual colonies were screened for β-galactosidase expression in response to bmp <dig> treatment by x-gal staining . approximately 13%  of drug resistant colonies expressed the reporter gene. as extensive bmp pathway activation is required for maintenance of undifferentiated escs  <cit> , basal bmp reporter activation could not be entirely overcome. therefore, it should be noted that colonies were selected on the basis of increase in x-gal staining relative to the unstimulated state. three colonies with induced responses to ligand were selected for blastocyst injection, resulting in establishment of  <dig> lines derived from separate transgene integration events: 1c <dig> and 2f <dig>  sagittal sectioning with subsequent x-gal staining of e <dig>  and e <dig>  embryos revealed a highly similar β-galactosidase expression pattern in these two strains . as the 1c <dig> strain displayed more intense staining, it was used for subsequent experiments, and is hereafter designated bre-lacz.

bmp inducibility of β-galactosidase expression in bre-lacz mice was verified by stimulation of murine embryonic fibroblasts  with recombinant bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> . after stimulation with either of these ligands, β-galactosidase accumulates intracellularly in a dose-dependent manner. this can both be visualized by x-gal staining , and quantified by colorimetric assay using the onpg substrate , demonstrating that the reporter is significantly activated by bmp <dig>  as with escs, the basal level of reporter gene activation in mefs is relatively high. this can be overcome to some degree by culture in serum free medium for  <dig> to  <dig> hours or addition of the bmp antagonist noggin to cell culture medium, but cannot be entirely quenched. a possible explanation for this residual basal pathway activation is that bmps are actively produced in embryonic fibroblasts  <cit> , and the extracellular antagonist noggin may be incapable of quenching signaling initiated intracellularly by bmp ligands. to explore this possibility, we compared lacz production with the abundance of phosphorylated smad  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> transcription factors  in untreated and noggin treated bre-lacz fibroblasts . although culture with noggin results in a significant reduction of both lacz production and psmad1/5/ <dig>  basal activation does remain, demonstrating that extracellular bmp antagonism does not quench endogenous bmp signaling in fibroblasts. previous experiments employing mefs in which smad <dig> had been conditionally inactivated demonstrated that tgfβ superfamily pathway activation is required for growth of these cells , and thus basal pathway activation is anticipated in these actively growing cells.

from these experiments, we propose that domains of β-galactosidase expression correlate with bmp pathway activation in vivo rather than transgene activation due to positional integration effects as we find that transgenic animals generated from  <dig> separate es cell clones display highly similar expression patterns. furthermore, based on in vitro ligand stimulation assays we conclude that the bre-lacz transgenic strain expresses β-galactosidase in response to bmp.

bre-lacz reporter activation correlates with nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated smad  <dig>   <dig> and 8
to definitively assay the degree to which in vivo reporter gene activation corresponds with pathway activation, we compared sections immunohistochemically stained for psmad1/5/ <dig> with x-gal stained sections of bre-lacz embryos . nuclear psmad1/5/ <dig> staining is a widely used marker of bmp pathway activation in diverse organ systems and species  <cit> , reporting on activation of bmp-induced r-smads upon ligand stimulation. e <dig>  was chosen as the most informative time point for these studies for two reasons. first, organogenesis is well underway, enabling comparison between nuclear psmad1/5/ <dig> accumulation and reporter gene activation in most systems. second, the paraformaldehyde fixed e <dig>  embryo is readily sectioned, without tearing due to uneven fixation. serial sagittal sections through  <dig> entire e <dig>  wild type embryos were immunohistochemically stained with a polyclonal psmad1/5/ <dig> antiserum , and representative sections are shown . negative controls consisting of e <dig>  wild type embryos stained either with secondary antibody alone, or with x-gal showed negligible background signal . low power micrographs of medial e <dig>  sections from wild type mice immunostained for psmad1/5/ <dig> and x-gal stained bre-lacz reporters show extensive overlap in specificity of staining . furthermore, the agreement in areas devoid of staining for both psmad1/5/ <dig> and x-gal is notable in this overview, indicating that the reporter is sensitively and specifically reporting on bmp pathway activation, without spurious ectopic activation. domains of reporter gene activation can also be seen at earlier developmental time points . specifically, at e <dig>  pathway activation with concomitant reporter gene activation is seen in the trigeminal ganglion , snout , forebrain , eye , dorsal root ganglia  and neural tube . one exception to the strong correlation between nuclear psmad1/5/ <dig> staining and reporter gene activation is the embryonic heart, which does not show noticeable psmad1/5/ <dig> staining in this assay. however, immunohistochemistry reveals relatively weak localized nuclear staining in this organ when fixed in isolation from the embryo . furthermore, a previous study has reported nuclear psmad1/5/ <dig> staining in cardiomyocytes of midgestation embryos  <cit> , and we therefore conclude that the pathway indeed is activated in the heart, but that our immunoassay is not sufficiently sensitive for its detection.

based on the comparison with nuclear accumulation of psmad1/5/ <dig>  we are confident that the bre-lacz faithfully reports on domains of bmp signaling in vivo.

bre-lacz reporter gene activation in developing organ systems
to validate the reporter for organogenesis studies, we performed analyses on a variety of tissues at  <dig> distinct time points during development: e <dig> , e <dig> , and e <dig> . additionally, immunostaining for psmad1/5/ <dig> was performed to allow correlation of pathway activation with reporter gene expression.

gut 
at both e <dig>  and e <dig> , the reporter is active in the epithelium of the developing gut. in the mesenchyme, comparatively less staining is apparent, and at e <dig>  few stained mesenchymal cells can be seen . nuclear psmad1/5/ <dig> is seen in a subset of epithelial cells at e <dig>  , but in all epithelial cells at e <dig>  . this staining pattern correlates well with previous reports, which have shown extensive nuclear accumulation of psmad1/5/ <dig> in epithelial cells of the villus with absence of signaling in most of the villus mesenchyme  <cit> .

liver 
two distinct populations of β-galactosidase positive cells can be seen from e <dig>  through to e <dig> : endothelial cells lining vessels, and single cells throughout the liver parenchyme. nuclear accumulation of psmad1/5/ <dig> is seen in a similar distribution .

lung 
the reporter is active in epithelium and mesenchyme from e <dig>  through e <dig> . in bronchiolar epithelia, pathway activation is not uniform, with signaling and non-signaling cells interspersed . this pattern is reflected in our psmad1/5/ <dig> staining , and in psmad1/5/ <dig> staining previously reported  <cit> . in agreement with this, reporter gene activation strongly resembles the expression pattern of follistatin like  <dig> , a bmp response gene  <cit> . reporter gene activation in lung mesenchyme is not apparent at e <dig> , but widespread at e <dig>  and e <dig> . little reporter activity is seen in alveolar epithelia, whereas strong staining can be seen in the vessel rich mesenchyme between alveoli. again, this pattern corresponds closely to previously reported psmad1/5/ <dig> staining, and the expression pattern of fstl <dig>  which is localized mainly to endothelial cells and smooth muscle in the mesenchyme  <cit> .

heart 
a consistent pattern is seen from e <dig>   to e <dig>    with reporter activation in myocardium and endothelium, but with little or no activation in endocardial cushions and valves . e <dig>  myocardium displays nuclear psmad1/5/ <dig> staining , and a similar pattern has previously been reported in cardiomyocytes of the e <dig>  heart  <cit> . nuclear psmad1/5/ <dig> accumulation in cardiomyocytes is not uniform in either of these studies, yet reporter gene activation does appear to be. likely explanations for this discrepancy could be either that: i) the bmp pathway is indeed active in all cardiomyocytes, but our immunoassay is only sensitive enough to detect a subset of these, or ii) bmp signaling is cyclical in these cells, causing β-galactosidase to accumulate in the cell during a period of activation of the pathway, leading to staining in cells in which the pathway is inactive. regardless of the explanation for this discrepancy, our data suggests that cardiomyocytes actively respond to bmp signaling on a population basis. bmp signaling is highly regulated in the endocardial cushions and valves of the developing heart, with few stained cells in the mesenchyme of either cushions  or semilunar valves . reporter gene activation can however be seen in overlying endothelial cells , which is consistent with the pattern of nuclear accumulation of psmad1/5/ <dig>  consistent with our finding of strong bmp pathway activation in myocardium and weak or absent activation in endocardial cushions and developing valves, bmp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are all expressed in a semi-overlapping pattern in myocardium  <cit> , whereas the bmp signaling inhibitors smad <dig> and smad <dig> are vigorously expressed in endocardial cushions  <cit> .

vasculature 
reporter gene activation and nuclear accumulation of psmad1/5/ <dig> are both primarily localized to endothelial cells, although there is some staining in vessel walls. recent studies have shown that smad-dependent signaling in endothelial cells is stimulated by bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> ligands activating the orphan alk <dig> receptor  <cit> . furthermore, biologically active bmp <dig> is a circulating plasma component in the human  <cit> , consistent with the luminal activation of bmp signaling seen in the reporter mouse strain.

skin 
the reporter is differentially regulated in skin isolated from the lumbar region of the embryo: in the basal layer, little or no activation can be seen, whereas strong activation is seen in the suprabasal layer, and weak activation in the subbasal layer. furthermore, individual cells within dermal papillae display activation. this data correlates well with a recent report, which suggested that bmp signaling is required in dermal papilla cells for their hair inductive properties  <cit> . reporter activation is consistent with nuclear psmad1/5/ <dig> accumulation, with the exception of the subbasal layer. as noted for other organs, the reporter is significantly more sensitive than the psmad1/5/ <dig> immunoassay, and the lack of staining in the subbasal layer may be due either to weak smad expression, or to limited smad phosphorylation.

limb 
the reporter is activated in the interdigital region of the e <dig>  forelimb . previous studies have identified a role for bmp signaling in apoptosis of the interdigital region  <cit> , and this pattern of reporter gene activation is consistent with psmad1/5/ <dig> nuclear accumulation in the developing autopod  <cit> . in the presumptive humerus at e <dig> , strong reporter activation is seen in proximal and distal bone that contains resting and proliferative chondrocytes, while little or no activation is seen in the overlying perichondrium . reporter gene activation correlates strongly with nuclear psmad1/5/ <dig> in chondrocytes, and little or no staining in the perichondrium of the developing humerus . strong nuclear accumulation of psmad1/5/ <dig> has previously been observed in chondrocytes, and conditional inactivation of bmp type i receptors demonstrates that bmp signaling is required for cartilage condensation and skeletogenesis of endochondral bone  <cit> . furthermore, compound inactivation of bmp <dig> and bmp <dig> indicate that these may be the cognate ligands required for bmp-mediated skeletogenesis  <cit> . to ascertain the degree of reporter activation in mineralized tissue, we cultured metatarsal rudiments from e <dig>  bre-lacz embryos with or without  <dig> ng/ml bmp <dig> for  <dig> hours . the staining pattern is similar in both treated and untreated groups , with strong signal in condensing or proliferative chondrocytes and a graded weaker signal toward the presumptive ossification center .

in this analysis of organogenesis of liver, gut, lung, heart, vasculature, skin, and bone, we find that there is a remarkable consensus between reporter gene activation and nuclear accumulation of psmad1/5/ <dig>  furthermore, patterns of bmp reporter expression largely coincide with previous studies using the psmad1/5/ <dig> antiserum. from this survey, we conclude that the bre-lacz strain is an appropriate tool for further detailed studies of organogenesis.

identification of bmp responding cells in the developing kidney
numerous studies have defined roles for bmp ligands in development of the kidney. bmp <dig>  <cit> , bmp <dig>  <cit>  and bmp <dig>  <cit>  are all required for appropriate nephrogenesis. interestingly, the molecular function of these ligands appears to be interchangeable  <cit> , indicating that unique patterns of expression of these genes are decisive for development of the kidney rather than their individual properties  <cit> . although detailed expression data is available for bmp genes in the developing kidney  <cit> , studies to define cellular targets of their gene products have generated ambiguous results, complicating the interpretation of loss of function phenotypes. this is presumably due to variability of reagents and protocols for detection  <cit> . using the bre-lacz mouse, we are able to establish an unambiguous map of smad dependent bmp responses in the developing kidney, facilitating interpretation of loss of function mutants in the bmp pathway.

mesonephros
in the e <dig>  embryo, bmp signaling is activated in the proximal pole of the mesonephric tubule, and little or no activation can be detected in the distal pole, which connects to the mesonephric duct . this pattern of pathway activation corresponds closely with bmp <dig> expression in these nephrons  <cit> . uniform low level signaling is seen in the mesonephric duct . little is known about the role of bmp signaling in development of the primitive kidney in the mouse. however, loss of function studies in the amphibian reveal a requirement for bmp signaling both for formation of the pronephric duct and tubule  <cit> , indicating that activation of this signaling system may also be a requirement for pro- and mesonephros formation in the mammal.

metanephros
two developmental time points were chosen for studies of metanephros development: e <dig>  and e <dig> . at e <dig> , the ureteric bud derived collecting duct migrates into the metanephric blastema and induces the nephron progenitor population, or nephrogenic mesenchyme. at this time signaling is most prominent in the trunk of the collecting duct, but not the tips or leading edges of these structures and little pathway activation can be seen in the nephrogenic mesenchyme . within the blastema, islands of bmp-signaling vasculature can be seen. this pattern of signaling is corroborated by nuclear psmad1/5/ <dig> accumulation  and previously published psmad1/5/ <dig> immunostaining  <cit> , showing pathway activation specifically in trunks but not tips of collecting ducts. in the e <dig>  kidney, widespread activation of the pathway reporter is seen, with the exception of the nephrogenic zone . tubular structures at numerous stages of differentiation and glomeruli display reporter activation. this pattern largely corresponds to nuclear accumulation of psmad1/5/ <dig> , although psmad1/5/ <dig> staining is weak in nephron tubules and in the glomerulus . to discern precise locations of pathway activation, we generated a series of high power micrographs, and performed molecular marker analysis for structures lacking distinct morphology.

collecting ducts
to confirm that differential pathway activation in collecting ducts is maintained from e <dig>  to e <dig> , we counterstained x-gal stained kidney tissue from e <dig>  bre-lacz embryos with the dolichos bifloris lectin, an established marker for collecting ducts. signaling is maintained in collecting duct trunks from e <dig>  to e <dig>  , but collecting duct tips are devoid of signal at both of these time points. interestingly, a requirement for bmp signaling for collecting duct morphogenesis has recently been revealed by tissue specific inactivation of the alk <dig> bmp receptor gene with the collecting duct specific hoxb7cre driver  <cit> . this contrasts with previous work in which it was shown that inactivation of the smad <dig> signal transduction mediator with the same cre driver has little or no effect on kidney development  <cit> . this suggests that the bmp receptor may mediate collecting duct morphogenesis through smad independent signaling in collecting duct tips, possibly through activating the p38mapk pathway. signaling by bmp <dig> through this pathway has previously been demonstrated in cultured collecting duct cells. interestingly, low doses of bmp <dig> stimulate morphogenesis of cultured collecting duct cells through the p38mapk pathway, whereas high doses of bmp <dig> negatively regulate p38mapk pathway activation in a smad dependent fashion  <cit> . the complex regulation of collecting duct morphogenesis by bmp signaling is underscored by the outcome of inactivation of alk <dig> in this cell population: compared to wild type mice, hoxb7cre; alk3ca mice display an early increase in collecting duct branching followed by a reduction in growth and branching later in development  <cit> .

nephrogenic zone
the nephrogenic zone of the developing kidney is the region of de novo nephron formation, and is composed of peripheral stromal cells, nephrogenic mesenchyme , collecting duct tips and pretubular aggregates, the nascent epithelial aggregates that will give rise to nephrons . with the exception of a very small number of single cells in the vicinity of the nephrogenic mesenchyme, there is no pathway activation in this zone of the kidney . this is remarkable, considering that bmp signaling is required for survival of nephrogenic mesenchyme cells, and that bmp <dig> null kidneys are prematurely depleted of nephron progenitors  <cit> . furthermore, the bmp <dig> loss of function phenotype has been correlated with the non-redundant expression of bmp <dig> in the nephron progenitor population  <cit> , indicating that active bmp signaling does indeed occur in the nephrogenic zone. several alternative explanations to this apparent contradiction can be formulated. first, the id <dig> reporter might be inactive specifically in the nephrogenic zone of the kidney, whereas other bmp responsive genes are not. to address this, we compared in situ hybridization assays for the known bmp responsive genes id <dig>  id <dig> and bambi in the genepaint database . we find that none of these genes are expressed in the nephrogenic zone, whereas they are expressed in a pattern that appears to overlap with bre-lacz reporter activation in the medulla of the kidney. this strongly supports the contention that bmp signaling, rather than just id <dig> expression is inactive in the nephrogenic zone. second, bmp signaling may be mediated through smad independent rather than smad dependent signaling pathways, for example the p38mapk pathway  <cit> . third, bmp signals to the very small population of bmp responding cells adjacent to the nephrogenic mesenchyme may be required for maintenance of the nephrogenic mesenchyme. fourth, bmp signals emanating from the nephrogenic mesenchyme may be required by a responding cell population outside the nephrogenic zone, such as developing nephrons, to maintain the nephrogenic mesenchyme. fifth, bmp signaling may be required at a time point before establishment of the nephrogenic zone for survival of the nephrogenic mesenchyme population.

developing nephrons
in the nascent renal vesicle, little pathway activation can be seen . signaling becomes active throughout the early comma shaped body with the exception of the nascent podocytes , and this domain of pathway activation resolves to the presumptive proximal tubule section as the structure matures, with little signaling seen in the presumptive distal tubule. in the presumptive glomerulus of the late stage comma shaped body, signaling is seen in bowman's capsule, but the podocytes remain devoid of activation . this pattern of pathway activation is maintained in the s shaped body, where signaling can be seen in the proximal tubule, bowman's capsule, and capillaries forming within the vascular cleft. the distal tubule and podocytes remain free from signaling . costaining with lotus lectin demonstrates that bmp signaling is maintained in the proximal tubule as it matures . little pathway activation can be seen in mature distal tubules .

bmps are expressed in an overlapping manner at each stage of nephron development  <cit> : bmp <dig> is expressed in the nephrogenic mesenchyme, and subsequently remains localized to distal tubules and podocytes. bmp <dig> is first expressed in the renal vesicle, and subsequently becomes localized to distal tubules, whereas bmp <dig> is expressed in the proximal tubule, and bmp <dig> is expressed in bowman's capsule. in synthesizing this data, we find no clear correlation between ligand expression and pathway activation in the nascent nephron. other components of the pathway that have been studied provide limited insight into the pattern of activation. for example, smad <dig> is down regulated in condensing nephrogenic mesenchyme  <cit> , providing a possible explanation for the lack of activation in this compartment. also, the gene encoding the bmp antagonist usag- <dig> is expressed in the developing distal tubule, potentially explaining the limited bmp activation in this segment of the nephron  <cit> . however, transcripts for the bmp type  <dig> and  <dig> receptors can be found throughout the developing nephron  <cit> . counterintuitively, the bmp agonist crossveinless  <dig> is expressed in nephrogenic mesenchyme and regionally in the comma shaped body  <cit> . a caveat to these comparisons is of course that most expression data is based on transcript analysis, which does not necessarily correspond with production of active protein. therefore, only negative in situ hybridization results constitute data that can be fruitfully interpreted. an in vivo reporter is thus an extremely valuable tool in designing further studies of the bmp pathway in nephron morphogenesis based on conditional gene inactivation.

glomeruli
high power micrographs reveal that signaling is regionalized within the glomerulus. podocytes display little or no signaling in contrast to cells of bowman's capsule . to locate pathway activation in the core of the developing glomerulus, we performed x-gal and cd <dig> staining on adjacent sections from e <dig>  bre-lacz kidneys . staining for the cd <dig> endothelial cell marker overlaps with reporter activation, demonstrating that the pathway is activated in the glomerular capillary. interestingly, presumptive mesangial cells display little pathway activation . our findings correlate with the pattern of nuclear accumulation of psmad1/5/ <dig> , and one previous study  <cit> , in which it was furthermore shown that paracrine bmp signaling from podocytes to the endothelium significantly affects formation of the glomerular vasculature. bmp <dig> is strongly expressed in the developing podocyte, but the early onset of aberrant development precludes detailed analysis of glomerulus formation in the bmp <dig> loss of function mutant.

as a first step toward understanding the molecular basis for requirement of bmp signaling in the developing kidney at the cellular level, we performed a series of organ culture experiments in which we treated explanted kidneys with recombinant bmps. considering the surprising lack of signaling in the nephrogenic zone, our primary question was whether this region is refractory to smad dependent bmp signaling, or whether it can be ectopically activated by growth factor treatment. in serum free culture conditions, addition of up to  <dig> ng/ml bmp <dig> to the culture medium does not cause reporter activation in the nephrogenic mesenchyme , indicating that this cell population is indeed refractory to smad-dependent signaling. to control for the possibility that the reporter transgene might be transcriptionally silenced specifically in the nephrogenic mesenchyme, we performed an experiment in which transcription of the transgene was activated by heat shock to 42° for  <dig> hours. we find that heat shock activates transgene transcription in all cells of the explant, indicating that there is no confounding silencing of the transgene, and confirming that nephrogenic mesenchyme cells indeed are refractory to smad dependent bmp signaling . interestingly, collecting ducts do respond to increasing doses of bmp treatment by reporter activation in the tips . studies have previously shown that bmp treatment of explanted kidneys causes inhibition of collecting duct growth and branching  <cit> . cultures of collecting ducts in isolation have demonstrated that this is a direct effect rather than an effect mediated through the mesenchyme  <cit> . our study indicates that high doses of bmp treatment function to ectopically activate smad dependent signaling specifically in the tip of the collecting duct, offering a possible explanation for the growth inhibitory function of bmp treatment. in support of this, low doses of bmp <dig> in culture have been proposed to stimulate growth and branching of collecting duct cells through activation of smad independent signaling pathways, whereas high doses inhibit growth and branching through activation of smad dependent signaling  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the bre-lacz bmp reporter correlates well with immunoassays for pathway activation in the peripheral and central nervous system, gut, liver, lung, heart, vasculature, skin, developing bone and kidney, offering advantages in sensitivity and consistency over immunostaining for detection of pathway activation. a significant further advantage is the possibility to use the bre-lacz reporter in organ and primary cell culture experiments to explore pathway activation in response to experimental manipulation such as growth factor or chemical inhibition treatments. using the reporter we have for the first time generated a detailed map of cellular targets of bmp signaling in the developing kidney, making the surprising finding that the nephrogenic progenitor cell population is refractory to smad dependent bmp signaling, and that the nascent nephron displays graded pathway activation. furthermore, we find that the bmp pathway is not normally activated in collecting duct tips, but that it can be ectopically activated by treatment with recombinant bmps, offering a possible explanation for the inhibitory effects of bmp treatment on collecting duct growth and branching. the molecular differences between nephrogenic mesenchyme and collecting duct cells, which most likely underlie their differential responses to bmps constitute an interesting area for further research.
