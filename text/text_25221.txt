BACKGROUND
invasive salmonellosis is a global burden with more than  <dig> million cases per year resulting in over  <dig>  deaths . salmonella enterica infections, which are the gram-negative intracellular bacteria responsible for this burden, can result in diverse clinical manifestations. food-borne non-typhoidal salmonella , caused by serovar typhimurium or enteriditis, has recently emerged as a prominent cause of bloodstream infection, primarily in african adults and children, with an associated case fatality of up to 25%. hiv, malaria, and malnutrition being important risk factors  <cit> . typhoid or enteric fever, caused by the exclusively human serovar typhi or paratyphi a, is a bacteremic disease that can result into intestinal perforation, peritonitis, encephalopathy myocarditis and hemodynamic shock . antimicrobial resistance for all salmonella enterica infections is widespread  <cit> . the variations in the clinical features of infection with these intracellular pathogens relate to differences in the interaction between different salmonella serovars and the host  <cit> . a better understanding of host-pathogen interactions in invasive salmonellosis could explain these diverse clinical manifestations and potentially lead to new therapeutic strategies in order to decrease the considerable morbidity and mortality.

salmonella spp. are recognized by pattern recognition receptors , via conserved motifs termed ‘pathogen-associated-molecular-patterns’, resulting in activation of signaling pathways that initiate the inflammatory response . the two most important families of prrs are the membrane-bound toll-like receptors  and the cytosolic nod-like receptors . pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin - <dig>  il-1β , il- <dig> and tumor necrosis factor -α are released during early salmonella infection. by contrast, interferon -γ secretion  plays a central role in the control of persistent infection by affecting the extent of macrophage activation . salmonella spp. expresses multiple pathogen-associated-molecular-patterns, most notably type  <dig> secretion systems , flagella, fimbriae, lipopolysaccharide  and bacterial dna  <cit> . tlr activation induces the synthesis of pro-il-1β and pro-il- <dig>  upon which a second signal is provided by the activation of the intracellular inflammasome and caspase- <dig> leading to il-1β and il- <dig> processing  <cit> .

the role of the inflammasome in the recognition of salmonella spp. has been studied extensively using in vitro and in vivo models  <cit> . best studied nlrs in the recognition of salmonella are the pyrin domain containing- <dig>  and the card domain-containing protein- <dig> , which form inflammasome complexes consisting of caspase- <dig> and the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a card   <cit> . both the inflammasome receptors activate caspase- <dig> in response to s. typhimurium infection together with endogenous signals, and recruit asc and caspase- <dig> into a single cytoplasmatic focus, which subsequently serves as the site for pro-il-1β processing  <cit> . knockout mice lacking functional casp <dig>  casp1-casp <dig> double knockout mice, or mice deficient in the end product of inflammasome activation , do have higher bacterial loads and succumb earlier upon infection with s. typhimurium  <cit> . it was therefore hypothesized that nlrp3−/− , having lower levels of inflammasome-processed cytokines, would succumb earlier to infection with s. typhimurium. on contrary, mice deficient in nlrc <dig>  nlrp <dig> or asc were still able to clear s. typhimurium as efficiently as control mice  <cit> . an explanation given for this discrepancy in literature was that intracellular salmonella can also induce a salmonella pathogenicity island - <dig> independent form of lytic cell death via caspase- <dig>  <cit> . however, casp <dig> deficient mice have a phenotype comparable to wild-type  mice, showing a role for caspase- <dig> in the absence of caspase-1-mediated immunity  <cit> . furthermore, pre-growth conditions could have also led to this unexpected outcome, where conditions that favor spi- <dig> expression  show minimal roles for the inflammasome, while spi- <dig> growth conditions  show a more significant role for caspase- <dig> during salmonella infection  <cit> . additionally, nlrc4-dependent bacterial clearance is independent of nlrp <dig>  asc, il- <dig>  and il-1r, which could perhaps be an explanation for the unexpected phenotype of asc-deficient animals  <cit> . by contrast, cytokine processing that correlates with the formation of this asc/caspase- <dig> focus, asc-independent inflammasomes containing un-processed but active caspase- <dig> is also able to initiate rapid cell death  <cit> . yet, the relative importance of inflammasome-mediated cytokine maturation and pyroptosis during s. typhimurium infection still remains to be investigated.

in this study, we examined the in vivo relevance of asc and nlrp <dig> during salmonella infection using two clinically relevant experimental models. all mice received s. typhimurium orally and either developed a typhoid-like disease  or, when pretreated with streptomycin, developed a non-typhoid salmonellosis . we focused on bacterial growth, systemic cytokine release and organ pathology caused by s. typhimurium using log-phase bacteria.

mice
eight- to 12-week-old male asc−/− and nlrp3−/− mice, backcrossed  <dig> times to a c57bl/ <dig> genetic background, were generated as described  <cit>  and bred in the animal facility of the academic medical center . pathogen-free c57bl/ <dig> wt mice were purchased from charles river laboratories inc. . age- and sex-matched animals were used in all experiments and were housed in rooms with a controlled temperature a 12-h light–dark cycle, and were acclimatized for 2 weeks before the experiments. all experimental procedures and animal handling were done during the light cycle.

experimental infection and design
for preparation of the inoculum salmonella typhimurium strain  <dig> was used . stock bacteria were streaked from frozen aliquots into 50 ml luria broth for overnight incubation at 37°c in a 5% co <dig> incubator. thereafter, a 1 ml portion for 1: <dig> dilution was transferred to fresh luria broth and grown for approximately 2 h to mid-logarithmic phase . bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 10 min, washed and resuspended in sterile isotonic hank’s buffered salt solution  at a concentration of 107 cfu/ml s. typhimurium. inoculum size was verified retrospectively by serial 10-fold dilutions on blood agar . two different salmonella infection models were used: mice were starved for 12 h  or pre-treated with streptomycin   <dig>  mg/100 μl hbss per os , and inoculated orally with 106 cfu/ml s. typhimurium in 100 μl hbss as described previously . at  <dig> and 5 days after infection  and 4 days , mice were anesthetized with hypnorm  and midazolam , and then sacrificed by bleeding from the inferior vena cava. blood was drawn into heparinized tubes and organs , liver, spleen) were harvested and homogenized at 4°c in four volumes of sterile saline using a tissue homogenizer . death was confirmed by cutting the diaphragm. bacterial loads were determined by serial ten-fold dilutions on ba incubated at 37°c for 16 h. homogenates were centrifuged at 1500 × g at 4°c for 10 min, and supernatants were stored at −20°c pending assay.

values are expressed as mean with standard error of the mean unless stated otherwise. differences between groups were analyzed by mann–whitney u test. these analyses were performed using graphpad prism version  <dig> , graphpad software . values of p <  <dig>  were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
murine typhoid model for invasive salmonellosis
in order to study the in vivo role of asc and nlrp <dig> in invasive salmonellosis, we used a murine typhoid model for severe salmonella infection  <cit> . mice were infected with s. typhimurium strain s <dig> per os. this model mimics the pathology of untreated patients presenting with severe typhoid fever and is characterized by advanced liver and spleen inflammation and capillary thrombus formation in the peyer’s patches, which may lead to hemorrhage, necrosis, ulceration and intestinal perforation  <cit> . the onset of clinical symptoms and the end stage of disease were dependent on the dose administered. our pilot experiments showed that an oral dosage of 106 cfu s. typhimurium resulted in a mortality rate of over 90%  within 2 weeks. when the dosage was increased to 108 cfu s. typhimurium most mice  died within a week. when mice became clinically ill  bacterial counts in blood had increased dramatically from  <dig> to 105 cfu/ml at  <dig> and 5 days post-infection respectively, with a marked rise in proinflammatory cytokines, most notably tnf-α, ifn-γ and il- <dig>  in the systemic compartment.

il- <dig> is elevated during s. typhimurium infection in wt mice but completely abolished in asc−/− mice
inoculation of wt mice with s. typhimurium resulted in a rapid increase in il- <dig> plasma concentrations in the typhoid model , corresponding with inflammasome activation . in asc−/− mice il- <dig> remained undetectable during the course of infection . nlrp3−/− mice, however, expressed equal plasma levels of il- <dig> after infection at all time points when compared to wt mice , indicating that il- <dig> production is independent of nlrp <dig> during experimental s. typhimurium infection in vivo. il-1β levels remained undetectable in plasma from wt, asc−/− and nlpr3−/− mice after infection with s. typhimurium .figure  <dig>

asc−/− and nlrp3−/− mice display equal bacterial counts in all organs upon infection with s. typhimurium
having established that il- <dig> is upregulated during murine s. typhimurium infection, we infected wt, asc−/− and nlrp3−/− mice with s. typhimurium  and sacrificed them after  <dig> and 5 days  to determine the bacterial loads in mln , liver, spleen and blood in order to evaluate bacterial loads and dissemination to distant body sites. relative to wt mice, both asc−/− and nlrp−/− mice displayed equal bacterial loads in mlns, liver, spleen and blood at  <dig> and 5 days after infection .

systemic inflammatory non-inflammasome related cytokine release during in vivo s. typhimurium infection is asc- and nlrp3-independent
we next examined the impact of asc and nlrp <dig> deficiency on the host cytokine response to s. typhimurium in the typhoid mouse model. we measured concentrations of tnf-α, ifn-γ, mcp- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il-12p <dig> in plasma of asc−/−, nlrp3−/− and wt mice  <dig> and 5 days after infection. two days post-infection most systemic cytokine levels were still below the detection limit . after 5 days of infection, however, plasma levels tnf-α, monocyte chemo attractive protein - <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> were markedly elevated in all wt mice . remarkably, neither asc nor nlrp <dig> deficiency influenced systemic inflammation: no differences were found in any of the cytokine levels measured when comparing wt with asc−/− or nlrp3−/− mice, except for a slight increase in il- <dig> in asc−/− mice 5 days post-infection which could be a compensation for the lack of il- <dig> observed in these mice. surprisingly, plasma ifn-γ levels  did not differ between wt and asc−/− mice during s. typhimurium infection  despite the observed marked differences in release of il- <dig>  which is a key trigger for ifn-γ release via nk and t-cells, dendritic and other phagocytic cells during salmonella infection  <cit> .figure  <dig>

severe hepatic inflammation and distant organ injury during s. typhimurium infection are asc- and nlrp3-independent
next, we semi-quantitatively scored for the extent of inflammation histological samples of liver and spleen obtained  <dig> and 5 days after infection to further evaluate the role of asc and nlrp <dig> in systemic in vivo host defense against s. typhimurium in the typhoid model. during s. typhimurium infection, hepatic inflammation was characterized by significant inflammation with necrosis, abscess formation, portal inflammation and thrombus formation, which was most prominent 5 days after infection . no differences were observed between wt, asc−/− and nlrp3−/− mice  in pathology scores, which corresponded to the results of bacterial burdens and cytokine profiles. spleen inflammation scores were similar in all three mice strains studied at all time points . consistent with these pathology data, systemic markers of organ injury were significantly elevated during s. typhimurium infection, reflecting increased hepatocellular injury  and alanine transaminase ) and tissue damage  levels). however, these effects were not influenced by asc or nlrp <dig> deficiency .figure  <dig>

limited role for both asc and nlrp <dig> in systemic host defense against s. typhimurium in the colitis model
from the previous studies, which were performed in the typhoid model of salmonella infection, we concluded that asc and nlrp <dig> only play a very limited role in the systemic immune response to s. typhimurium infection. to investigate whether these findings were dependent on the model chosen, we examined the role of these inflammasome components in the colitis model of salmonella infection, in which mice were pre-treated orally with streptomycin. similar to the typhoid model, asc−/− mice displayed undetectable il- <dig> levels, whereas plasma il- <dig> concentrations in nlrp3−/− mice did not differ from those in wt mice . in contrast to the typhoid model, wherein mice do not develop marked inflammation of the cecum and colon, the colitis model results in a profound local inflammatory response with severe colitis and abscess formation after which salmonella spreads systemically . we found no difference when comparing wt, asc−/− and nlrp3−/− mice in our colitis model with respect to bacterial counts and dissemination towards the liver and the systemic compartment 4 days after infection , which corresponds to our findings in the typhoid model; the only exception being a slight increase in bacterial counts in the mlns of asc−/− mice when compared to mlns from wt mice. no differences were observed in plasma tnf-α, mcp- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> levels between wt, asc−/− and nlrp3−/− mice after infection with s. typhimurium . of note, in the colitis model, ifn-γ correlated to il- <dig> production and was reduced in the asc−/− mice when compared to wt mice . a difference between liver and spleen pathology is seen when comparing the typhoid and colitis models: while the typhoid fever model is characterized by marked hepatic necrosis, this was not regularly observed in the colitis model, while marked hepatic inflammatory cell influx is seen in both models  moreover, in the colitis model nlrp3−/−  displayed slightly increased spleen and liver parenchyma inflammation with corresponding elevated ast, albeit not alt, levels when compared to wt mice. this may suggest that the differences in inflammation or damage caused by s. typhimurium may be il- <dig> independent.figure  <dig>

discussion
in the present study we aimed to characterize the in vivo relevance of the central inflammasome molecules asc and nlrp <dig> in two different murine models of systemic salmonella infection. although in vitro studies confirmed that the inflammasome is activated during s. typhimurium infection, we here show that asc and nlrp <dig> individually are dispensable for the development of innate immunity against the pathogen. in the murine typhoid model, in which mice were not pretreated with streptomycin prior to oral inoculation with s. typhimurium, equal bacterial counts were seen in wt, asc−/− and nlrp3−/− mice after infection in all organs  at all time points. in line with the bacterial loads, proinflammatory cytokine levels, markers for tissue damage and organ pathology did not differ between groups. these results were replicated in a colitis model of s. typhimurium infection, in which mice were pretreated with streptomycin prior to oral inoculation, were we saw an equally limited role for both asc and nlrp <dig> in systemic host defense against s. typhimurium. taken together, the present results reveal a surprisingly limited role for asc and nlrp <dig> during in vivo s. typhimurium infection when dissecting different local and systemic compartments, especially given the fact that salmonella infection is generally believed to be intracellular and that the inflammasome has previously been described to be crucial for the host defense against other intracellular pathogens  <cit> .

nlrp <dig> can be triggered via terminal signals such as lysosomal rupture and the release of cathepsins and potassium, and the production of reactive oxygen species. the precise bacterial trigger for nlrp <dig> in s. typhimurium infection remains unclear, since it has been demonstrated that salmonella pathogenicity island- <dig> t3ss mutants  are still detected by nlrp <dig>  <cit> . more recently, it was shown that nlrp <dig> inflammasome activation is bacterial rna-mediated  <cit> , which might explain the nlrp3-dependent sensing of these mutants. viable s. typhimurium can trigger both the nrlp <dig> and nlrc <dig> inflammasomes in vitro, resulting in activation of caspase- <dig>  without involvement of other inflammasomes. the release of il-1β was shown to be completely dependent on the combined function of the nlrp <dig> and nlrc <dig> inflammasomes and blocking either one lead to partially decreased il-1β release  <cit> . the adaptor molecule asc is a crucial component of both the nlrp <dig> and nlrc <dig> inflammasomes as it can bridge the pyrin and card domain of these nrls to caspase- <dig>  which is necessary for its activation  <cit> . asc−/− bone-marrow derived macrophages stimulated with s. typhimurium in vitro had defects in both the nlrp <dig> and nlrc <dig> inflammasomes with regard to releasing mature il-1β  <cit> . although these studies all underscore the potential role for the inflammasome during salmonella infection in vitro, previous in vivo studies were not as evident.

during s. typhimurium infection il-1β is reported to be critical for the intestinal phase of the disease, while il- <dig> is important for resistance to systemic infection but not the early gastrointestinal phase of infection  <cit> . mice lacking both nlrp <dig> and nlrc <dig> genes showed an increased susceptibility to s. typhimurium infection, similar to caspase-1−/− or il-18−/− mice, whereas mice lacking either nlrp <dig> or nlrc <dig> did not succumb earlier to infection, which was ascribed to the ability of nlrp <dig> and nlrc <dig> to be engaged by distinct signals  <cit> . in previous studies using a typhoid infection model, asc−/− mice were shown to have comparable bacterial loads  relative to wt mice when challenged with a different salmonella strain , while their serum il- <dig> levels remained low, albeit not significantly different  <cit> . it was therefore speculated that asc may play a role in vivo in the maturation of cytokines, whereas it is not essential for restricting bacterial growth, suggesting that additional asc-independent pathways could be involved in activating caspase- <dig> in response to nlrc <dig> and nlrp <dig> activation  <cit> . indeed, it was shown that nlrc <dig> could also activate caspase- <dig> even in the absence of asc, to induce pyroptosis, asc however remains to be crucial for cytokine maturation during salmonella infection  <cit> . furthermore, intracellular salmonella could induce a form of lytic cell death via caspase- <dig>  <cit> , which was ifn-γ-mediated  <cit> . to study the in vivo role of the asc and nlrp <dig> molecules in more depth we here made use of two different lethal s. typhimurium models modeling typhoid and colitis disease. we showed that il- <dig> release in plasma of asc−/− mice was significantly decreased in both models and previous studies have suggested that impaired il- <dig> release could enhance s. typhimurium susceptibility in mice  <cit> . surprisingly, we were unable to find a role for either asc or nlrp <dig> in the host defense against s. typhimurium infection in the typhoid model: no differences were found in bacterial counts in any organ  at all time points. furthermore, proinflammatory cytokine levels , markers for hepatocellular injury , cell damage in general  and organ pathology  did not differ between groups. in a similar study using a burkholderia pseudomallei infection model, it was noted that il- <dig> release was drastically reduced in asc−/− and nlrp3−/− mice, although it was still detectable in these mice at higher levels than uninfected mice, leading to the conclusion that inflammasome-independent production of il- <dig> may be sufficient to provide some level of protection against infection with low dosages of burkholderia pseudomallei  <cit> . this could be an explanation for the phenotype observed in the nlrp3−/− mice, which was comparable to wt mice, but not for the asc−/− mice, as in both our infection models the il- <dig> levels of asc−/− mice remained below detection limit independent of the stage of infection.

although no differences were observed between bacterial loads in wt and asc−/− or nlrp3−/− mice in the typhoid model, small differences in the streptomycin pre-treated group were seen with regard to bacterial loads  and splenic and hepatic inflammation between groups. a potential explanation for the different roles played by asc in both models with regards to hepatocellular injury could be the marked difference in ifn-γ release: where ifn-γ was not reduced in the typhoid model, it was reduced in asc−/− mice in the colitis model. in salmonella-infected mice pre-treated with streptomycin, ifn-γ seems to coordinate t-cell responses and the anti-microbial activity of phagocytes  <cit> . il-18−/− mice show an increased susceptibility to s. typhimurium infection  <cit> . interestingly, in vivo il- <dig> neutralization causes a marked decrease in circulating ifn-γ levels during salmonella infection  <cit> . it could therefore be hypothesized that the increased susceptibility to s. typhimurium of il-18−/− mice could in part be caused by the low circulating ifn-γ levels and not by absence of il- <dig> per se. the normal ifn-γ response in the typhoid model could potentially trigger the described asc-independent pathway via caspase- <dig> and ifn-γ  <cit> . it has to be noted, however, that this does not explain the observed differences between ifn-γ levels in the typhoid- and colitis model in asc−/− mice and the increased hepatocellular injury inflicted upon nlrp3−/− mice despite lower but not significantly different ifn-γ levels in the colitis model.

our study has several limitations. pre-growth conditions of salmonella could have influenced our results as it determines expression of spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> expression among other virulence factors necessary for inflammasome activation  <cit> . we choose to use log-phase bacteria in our models according to standard methods in order to induce experimental infection in mice. furthermore, the nlrc <dig> receptor has been described to play an important role during salmonella infection  <cit> ; adding a functional knockout mice to our experimental protocol could have given additional insights into the role of this inflammasome receptor in the typhoid and colitis model. it should be noted however that at present  <dig> human nlrs have been described and  <dig> mouse nlrs  <cit> . a plausible alternative interpretation of our work might be the presence of notable redundancy in the mouse system of nlrs so that one or more nlrs may be able to take over the role of nlrp <dig> in knockout mice , and that a double  knockout may be necessary in order to see a phenotype . indeed, broz et al. recently showed that nlrp3/nlrc <dig> double knockout mice have a markedly increased susceptibility for invasive salmonellosis when compared to wt controls  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we tried to further detail the role of key-inflammasome proteins asc and nlrp <dig> during in vivo salmonella infection. inflammasome pathways are intensely complex and have proven to show immense redundancy. indeed, our results reveal a limited role for both asc and nlrp <dig> during in vivo s. typhimurium infection, which is remarkable given the central role attributed to the inflammasome in the host defense against intracellular bacteria. in the future, it would be of great interest to study these proteins in humans with invasive salmonellosis or to make use of ko mice with complete blockage of all inflammasomes important in salmonella pathogenesis.
