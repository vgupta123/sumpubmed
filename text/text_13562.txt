BACKGROUND
soybean  merr.) has significant agronomic and nutritional relevance because of the high concentrations of protein and oil in its grains. concomitant with the high protein content, the legume shows a strong demand for nitrogen  for optimal development and grain productivity  <cit> . although atmospheric n <dig> is abundant, no eukaryotic organism is able to directly assimilate it, due to the strong triple bond linking the atoms  <cit> . however, when growing in n-depleted soils, much of soybean’s need for n can be obtained via biological nitrogen fixation  in root nodules, through the symbiotic association with bacteria, collectively called rhizobia, belonging mainly to the species bradyrhizobium japonicum and bradyrhizobium elkanii <cit> .

in brazil, estimates indicate that the value of bnf by soybean root nodules is equivalent to u$ <dig> billion/year; furthermore, bnf is an environmentally beneficial process, in comparison to the use of synthetic n fertilizers  <cit> .

the establishment of the symbiosis starts with molecular interactions between the rhizobia and the host plant, involving a succession of complex processes that lead to profound changes in both symbionts  <cit> . the plant releases molecular signals, in particular flavonoid compounds, that are primary inducers of rhizobial nodulation genes. the induction of this class of genes leads to the biosynthesis of nod factors, rhizobial signals that trigger specific responses in the root hairs of the host plant; plant cells perceive the presence of nod factors—and of the rhizobia—through cell-surface receptors on the roots  <cit> . many molecular events are triggered in a coordinated manner, leading to morphological and physiological changes in the host plant, necessary for a successful symbiosis  <cit> .

given the complexity of the symbiosis, studies of transcriptional profiles during nodulation are important to gain greater understanding of the nodulation process. studies conducted with soybean, e.g. brechenmacher et al.  <cit> , evaluated gene-expression profiles in roots inoculated with b. japonicum , and elucidated reduced plant defenses. furthermore, a complex regulatory mechanism in the plant was detected, enabling it to adapt to changes in its nutritional status. another study of the transcriptome of soybean roots inoculated with strain usda  <dig> showed rapid changes in gene expression in response to inoculation, with the pattern modified in accordance with the various stages of nodule development and function  <cit> .

brazil is the second most prolific producer of soybean worldwide, and probably the country where bnf has been exploited most successfully  <cit> . however, no investigation of transcriptomics with brazilian strains and cultivars have been reported. this study aimed at analyzing the global expression of genes in soybean roots of cultivar conquista inoculated with b. japonicum strain cpac  <dig> , both broadly used in brazil, through the suppressive subtractive hybridization  technique  <cit>  combined with sequencing illumina analysis.

RESULTS
the ssh library of the brazilian cultivar conquista, at 10 days after inoculation  with b. japonicum strain cpac  <dig>  which is broadly used in commercial inoculants in brazil, resulted in  <dig> , <dig> reads.

among the  <dig>  sequences identified as up-regulated,  <dig>  were automatically recorded by the autofact tool and grouped into functional categories , according to the ontologies of molecular function  and biological process , using blast2go software  <cit> . the remaining  <dig> sequences presented no similarity with a known protein of the database.

concerning molecular function , the categories including more reads were those of ion binding, followed by transferase activity, nucleotide binding, hydrolase activity and oxidoreductase activity, demonstrating intense metabolic activity occurring during the nodulation process. figure 1b highlights the biological processes triggered in the host plant, at  <dig> dai with rhizobia, where the most representative category was of the metabolic process, followed by response to stimulus. table  <dig> displays a detailed description of the main biological processes, triggered in the soybean roots by the presence of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria. in general, our results are consistent with those obtained with other legumes evaluated during nodulation, for example, medicago truncatula, in which many physiological processes were increased by the presence of rhizobia, leading to the induction of genes involved in signaling, transcriptional regulation, intracellular calcium oscillations, oxidative explosion, cell proliferation and alterations in the cytoskeleton, all necessary for nodule development and function  <cit> .

furthermore, studies with lotus japonicus indicate that genes involved in across-membrane transport, hormone metabolism, cell-wall modification and signal transduction were also induced by the presence of the bacteria  <cit> .

moreover, we also identified in our library nodulin- <dig>  <cit> , nodulin- <dig>  <cit> , nodulin- <dig>  <cit> , nodulin- <dig>  <cit> , among others, which are recognized as induced genes in the tested condition, giving further confidence in ssh data.

for a more focused discussion of our results, categories were selected based on the high level of gene expression , in comparison to the rpkm values of genes validated by rt-qpcr . therefore, we assume that other genes with greater values of rpkm are also up-regulated during soybean nodulation.

metabolic process
previous studies of the effects of inoculation of soybean with b. japonicum, at various stages of nodulation, ranging from hours , days  and weeks   <cit>  after inoculation have reported profound changes in plant metabolism, that varied with the growth stage analyzed  <cit> . thus, our study is in accordance with hayashi et al.  <cit>  because the nod factors perception cause metabolic changes, and here we can observed that the metabolic pathways most active in the presence of rhizobia were glycolysis and the krebs cycle . indeed, for the development and functioning of nodules, it is necessary to allocate plant sources of c to the new organs  <cit> . similarly, genes involved in the breakdown of sucrose, glycolysis and synthesis of amino acids were found to be differentially expressed in l. japonicus, consistent with these processes being accelerated during nodulation  <cit> . the glycolytic pathway and krebs cycle are closely linked, representing the main ways of acquiring energy. consistent with the n2-fixing symbiosis being an energy-demanding process  <cit> , the expression of genes related to both pathways increased. additional file 1: table s <dig> presents the identified genes related to energetic pathways; of these, glyma14g <dig>   had the highest level of expression based on its rpkm value. this enzyme participates in the production of dicarboxylic acids for rhizobial and carbon skeletons for the assimilation of n by the plant  <cit> . according to brechenmacher et al.  <cit> , this induction effect occurs from the eighth day after inoculation.

among the metabolic processes, nodulation also changes the redox state of root cells, and a major metabolic pathway activated by cpac  <dig> was the synthesis of glutathione , which is protective against reactive oxygen species   <cit> . the levels of expression of the genes for glutathione peroxidase, gamma-glutamyl transferase and glutathione s-transferase were higher than for the other genes encoding enzymes in this pathway .

as shown by chang et al.  <cit> , changes in redox state are observed at various stages of nodulation. they occurred during early symbiotic interactions in medicago sativa <cit>  and phaseolus vulgaris <cit> . transcripts present in the subtractive library, which participate of antioxidant defense system, are shown in table  <dig>  in medicago truncatula, inhibition of the synthesis of glutathione resulted in fewer nodules on inoculated roots, showing the critical role of glutathione in nodule morphogenesis  <cit> .

signaling
signal-transduction genes are important at the various stages of the symbiotic interaction, as they lead to the coordinated development of epidermal and cortical cells needed to permit rhizobial penetration and nodule initiation  <cit> . it is known that the processes of recognition and signaling triggered by the rhizobia activate genes related to nodulation; some of them have been characterized in soybean, such a receptor kinases nark   <cit>  and nork   <cit> , protein kinase type lrr  encoded, respectively, by genes glyma12g <dig> and glyma09g <dig>  libault et al.  <cit>  identified other genes related to the lrr proteins that are differentially regulated during nodulation.

among the genes with high expression level identified in our library, two encoded lrrs , highlighting glyma16g <dig> , with the highest level of expression  among all genes of the ssh library. therefore, this gene represents a novelty that may be an important receptor. besides soybean, lrrs have also been identified in the roots of lotus japonicus <cit> , medicago truncatula and sesbania rostrata inoculated with their specific symbionts  <cit> .

also noteworthy are genes encoding calmodulins , important proteins that participate in the transduction of signals triggered by the interaction of nod factors to specific receptors on the surface of the root and, thus, allowing the expression of nodulins  <cit> . the most common calmodulin genes identified in the nodulation of soybean are glyma15g <dig>  and glyma08g <dig>   <cit> , and here three other genes were detected , whose participation in nodulation had not been emphasized.

response to stimulus
the category that combined the second largest number of transcripts was that of response to stimulus, which includes genes related to abiotic and biotic factors, including stress and defense responses and reactions to endogenous stimuli. these genes are involved in morphological, biochemical and physiological changes stimulated by inoculation with b. japonicum. among the identified genes in this category we emphasize the calreticulin, protein pdr and glycoside hydrolases  <dig> .

the calreticulins have great functional diversity; they participate in protein folding , in the homeostasis of intracellular ca2+ and signaling, and are also crucial for the growth and development of plants. moreover, they are potent regulators of the plant in response to various stresses, including the activation of mechanisms of resistance to infections by pathogens  <cit> . these proteins have been broadly studied in animals, but their characterization in plant models remains limited  <cit> . among the identified genes corresponding to calreticulins, glyma20g <dig>  showed a high level of expression. interestingly, no studies of the activities of these proteins during the nodulation have been reported.

another gene detected in our study was related to a pdr-like-abc transporter-family protein, involved in the responses to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants and fungi  <cit> . these proteins have been identified as transporters involved in the secretion of genistein in soybean roots in response to b. japonicum <cit> , thus with an important role in nodulation.

genes encoding glycoside hydrolases- <dig> were also detected. they are also known as chitinases and, among other functions in the symbiosis, it is believed that they participate in the perception and degradation of nod factors  <cit> . xie et al.  <cit>  showed an increase in activity of chitinase in the presence of nod factors of rhizobia in soybean roots, suggesting that these enzymes can regulate the perception of nod factors during nodulation.

transport
genes related to transport accounted for about 10% of differentially expressed genes; table  <dig> displays the genes with the highest expression levels. this category was also expressed in the nodulation of m. truncatula <cit>  and includes, among others, genes encoding membrane-transport proteins. aquaporins, membrane proteins responsible for transport, especially of water, are expressed  <cit> . the soybean genes encoding aquaporins most commonly found on nodulation are nodulin- <dig>  found in the symbiosome  <cit> . other genes encoding aquaporins were identified in our study . during nodulation in medicago truncatula, the aquaporins were the most expressed membrane proteins from early to relatively late stages of nodulation  <cit> , emphasizing their importance during nodule organogenesis.

other transporters are important for the acquisition of nutrients by root cells and the symbiosome  <cit> . expression was detected of genes related to abc transport, amino acid transport, and oligopeptide, potassium and sulfate transport .

cell-wall modification
given the need for structural modification of the root during infection by rhizobia, several genes are involved in plant cell-wall penetration and cytoskeletal reorganization. some genes involved in cell-wall modification encode enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism . this is particularly important in nodulation, because the transcripts that encode enzymes  active in this pathway may be acting specifically on the reorganization of the root and the formation of nodular structure.

a study by kaewsuralikhit et al.  <cit> , of soybean at  <dig> dai, showed elevated expression of pectinesterase, one of the enzymes responsible for cell-wall degradation during the formation of nodules, which also occurs in sesbania rostrata <cit> . in medicago truncatula, a pectinesterase was up-regulated and cellulase was induced on the third and fourth days post-inoculation  <cit> . and in the present study, we also identified the gene that encode pectinesterase  <dig> dai, confirming that this gene is induced only some days post-inoculation, because in the early hours, the pectinesterase gene showed as down-regulated  <cit> .

another important enzyme with a high level of expression in this study was sucrose synthase , which, among other known functions in nodulation, contributes significantly to development of cell wall  <cit> .

ssh validation by rt-qpcr and proteomics
two genes, represented by glyma16g <dig> and glyma18g <dig>  were chosen for ssh validation by rt-qpcr. we took the genes that showed rpkm values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, in order to verify the sensitivity and quality of the subtraction. expression levels of both genes were up-regulated at the same time,  <dig> dai .

proteomics was used as a supplemental functional analysis, in view to validate the transcriptional data. in parallel with the rna extraction, we also made the protein extraction of both conditions . two-dimensional gel electrophoresis profiles of the two conditions were compared with each other. representative spots, which showed a significant higher volume in the inoculated condition, were selected and identified by mass spectrometry.

two spots were successfully identified and one of the selected spots didn’t fit into the statistical parameters of identification. these two proteins identified were also found in the subtractive library data, which represents a functional confirmation of the transcriptomic analysis. two of them were only detected in the inoculated condition: a putative glutathione-s-transferase . the other identified protein was a sucrose synthase , which had a  <dig>  fold change in relation to the non-inoculated condition . it is also worth mentioning that both spots identified correspond to the same glyma ids identified by the rnaseq analysis.

CONCLUSIONS
by using the ssh technique, it was possible to identify the main biological processes triggered in the brazilian soybean cultivar conquista after inoculation with the commercial strain cpac  <dig> of b. japonicum. among the main processes, we may highlight the metabolic pathways of primary metabolism, cell-wall modification and antioxidant-defense systems. putative functions for some of these genes were assigned for the first time in the bradyrhizobium-soybean symbiosis.

the analysis of transcriptional profiles of soybean in the presence of b. japonicum is essential to understand the symbiosis. some transcripts have been previously described in nodulated soybean; however, novel genes were firstly described and could be related to the brazilian germoplasm , both studied by this standpoint for the first time.
