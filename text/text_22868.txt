BACKGROUND
the digestive tracts of living systems, from nematodes to humans, contain a zoo of microorganisms. many of these microbiota fill a required role for the host. the microbiota in human gastrointestinal systems produce folate and vitamin k, break down excess sugars and fibers, and help activate certain medications  <cit> . however, digestive tracts also play host to various bacteria associated with pathophysiological states. ulcerative colitis, diabetes mellitus, and irritable bowel syndrome are just a few of the diseases influenced by intestinal microbiota  <cit> .

microorganisms of the intestinal tract have been shown to influence the aging process. metchnikoff suggested that the longevity of bulgarians was attributed to their consumption of lactic acid generating bacteria in yogurts  <cit> . although the composition of the intestinal microbiome seems to be unique to each individual  <cit> , there are common trends when the gut microbiome of babies is compared across diverse cultures  <cit> . some studies have shown certain age-related diseases can be prevented or ameliorated with the use of certain microorganisms  <cit> .

model organisms can be utilized as a first step in assessing the relationship between longevity and the gut microbiome. altering gut microorganism composition can influence the aging process in model systems in a safe and effective manner  <cit> . mice fed diets supplemented with lactobacillus as a probiotic not only showed no pathogenic response, but also lived longer than littermates on a standard diet  <cit> .

c. elegans is routinely maintained on the standard lab e. coli strain op <dig>  wild-type  worms fed this diet live an average of two weeks  <cit> , and recapitulate many of the aging-related changes observed in humans. old worms show muscular disorganization, diminished movement, and accumulate the aging-related pigment lipofuscin  <cit> . worms fed op <dig> show an accumulation of bacteria in the pharynx and gut as they age  <cit>  and old nematodes appear constipated  <cit> . c. elegans fed diets of either lactobacillus or bifidobacterium were long-lived and more resistant to the enteropathogen salmonella enterica as compared to worms fed the standard op <dig> e. coli lab diet  <cit> .

feeding worms a diet of gd <dig> e. coli deficient in coenzyme q  leads to an increased life span without a cost to fertility  <cit> . q is an essential lipid component of the electron transport chain and is required for respiration-dependent energy production. the life span increase of nematodes fed a gd <dig> q-less e. coli diet is not due to a lack of q, because supplying a water-soluble formulation of q that is effectively assimilated by the worm does not revert the life span of the gd1-fed animals to that observed in op50-fed animals  <cit> . in addition, worms fed e. coli mutant strains with defects in atp synthase  lived longer than worms fed op <dig>  <cit> . this implied that the respiratory status of the bacteria was a crucial factor in the life span of the worms fed these diets.

the relationship between respiration in the e. coli diet and the survival of the worms fed these diets identifies q and atp synthase as potential virulence factors. a virulence factor is any process, structure or metabolite required by a microorganism to be pathogenic to its host  <cit> . in this study we show that loss of respiration in e. coli yields delayed gut colonization and improved worm survival. indeed, in young animals, few respiratory deficient e. coli are detected on the posterior side of the pharynx. worms fed a mixture of q-replete and q-deficient e. coli show intermediate life span extension, indicating that the degree of bacterial colonization of the gut may be dose dependent. we hypothesize that decreased or delayed gut colonization confers a survival advantage to animals fed the q-deficient e. coli by diminishing or delaying stress due to high numbers of coliform bacteria. c. elegans fed respiratory-deficient e. coli diets serves as a model for characterizing the effects of anti-aging probiotic therapies.

RESULTS
the gd1-mediated life span extension is independent of dietary restriction or worm q content
findings from previous studies have suggested that the life span increase in c. elegans fed a q-less  e. coli diet operates independently of dietary restriction  <cit> . neither brood size nor worm size, two indicators of dietary restriction, were altered in wild-type animals fed gd <dig> as compared to the standard op <dig> diet  <cit> . as a genetic test of the role of dietary restriction, we fed skn <dig> mutants the gd <dig> diet, since these mutants fail to respond to dietary restriction and are sensitive to oxidative stress  <cit> . skn- <dig>  a transcription factor homologous to mammalian nrf <dig>  plays a role in metabolic regulation and interacts with signaling systems that respond to changes in nutrition  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  skn <dig> mutants fed gd <dig> live longer than hatch-mates fed op <dig>  these results confirm that the gd <dig> diet imparts life span extension independently of effects related to dietary restriction.


a growing body of evidence indicates that the increased life span of c. elegans fed the gd <dig> diet is not due to the lack of q per se. c. elegans clk <dig> mutants also show enhanced life span in response to the gd <dig> diet  <cit> . the clk <dig> mutants lack q but continue to produce rhodoquinone, an amino-isoprenylated quinone involved in anaerobic respiratory metabolism, as well as demethoxy-q, the penultimate intermediate in q biosynthesis  <cit> . to determine whether the gd <dig> diet would also act to extend life span of a c. elegans mutant with an earlier defect in the q biosynthetic pathway, we tested the effects of this diet on two c. elegans coq <dig> mutants. coq- <dig> is an o-methyltransferase required for two steps of q biosynthesis: the first o-methylation step precedes formation of the quinone ring, and the second o-methylation step is the final step, producing q  <cit> . c. elegans coq <dig> mutants have more severe phenotypes than the clk <dig> mutants  <cit> . the coq <dig> mutant worms respond to the gd <dig> e. coli diet when maintained on the diet either from time of hatching , or when the diet is provided to the mutants upon reaching the l <dig> larval stage . these results indicate that the gd <dig> diet imparts life span extension even to worm mutants with severe early defects in q biosynthesis, and hence its effects are independent of worm q content.


worms fed a mixture of gd <dig> and rescued gd <dig> show an intermediate life span extension
it seemed likely that the life-span extension of gd1-fed animals might arise for two distinct reasons:  the gd1-diet mediated life span extension could be due to the presence of a beneficial component present in respiratory defective e. coli; or  to the absence of a toxic component present in respiratory competent e. coli. in order to distinguish between these two possibilities, we carried out a mixing experiment. nematodes were fed the gd1:pbsk  diet, the rescued gd <dig> diet , or a 50: <dig> mix. in order to prevent growth of the respiring cells from dominating the mixed diet, the e. coli were placed on ngm plates containing the bacteriostatic antibiotic tetracycline. previous studies have shown that the gd <dig> mediated life span extension remains effective even when antibiotics inhibited bacterial proliferation  <cit> . worms fed this e. coli mixture showed an intermediate degree of life span extension . although this result does not unambiguously identify one diet as beneficial or detrimental, it does indicate that the benefit of the gd <dig> diet takes effect even in the presence of respiratory-competent e. coli. however, the benefit of the mixed diet may depend on the presence of the bacteriostatic antibiotic.


a, b, c, d, e, f, identify cohorts from the same experiment. within each cohort data were subjected to one-way anova analyses with fisher's test at a significance of  <dig> .

.

worms fed gd <dig> are more thermotolerant and resistant to juglone treatment
mutants of c. elegans with life span extension often show enhanced resistance to thermal and oxidative stress  <cit> , suggesting that worms fed the gd <dig> diet would also demonstrate stress resistance. juglone is a quinone that imposes both oxidative and electrophilic stress  <cit> . juglone penetrates the worm cuticle and has been used to select for oxidative stress-resistant mutants  <cit> . as shown in figure 4a, worms fed gd <dig> from the hatchling stage display improved survival following exposure to  <dig> μm juglone, as compared to similarly treated worms fed op <dig>  it is unlikely that the improved worm survival is due to hypersensitivity of gd <dig> e. coli to juglone treatment because the gd <dig> e. coli were actually more resistant to juglone treatment than op <dig> e. coli . similarly, worms fed gd <dig> are more thermotolerant at the l <dig> stage compared to worms fed op <dig> .


excreted components present in gd <dig> e. coli spent media are not responsible for life span extension
previous studies have shown that e. coli mutants with defects in the ubia gene, required for q biosynthesis, excrete large amounts of d-lactic acid in the spent media  <cit> . we found that the spent media of both gd <dig> and gd1:pbsk e. coli contain millimolar quantities of d-lactic acid . in contrast, the spent media collected from cultures of op <dig> contain only 10– <dig> μm d-lactic acid, similar to the concentration observed in lb media alone. similarly, rescued gd <dig> cells containing a wild-type copy of ubig produce very low levels of d-lactic acid, indicating that excretion of d-lactic acid by the gd <dig> e. coli is due to the loss of q biosynthesis. the accumulation of lactic acid, in conjunction with the observation that ubig mutant e. coli produce acetate under similar conditions  <cit> , indicates that loss of q forces the cells into a constitutive fermentative metabolic state despite the availability of oxygen.


to determine if the excreted d-lactic acid  present in gd <dig> spent media is responsible for the increased life span in worms fed this diet, we performed media swap experiments. actively respiring rescued gd <dig> cells containing the ubig gene on a plasmid  were suspended in either their own spent media or the spent media from non-rescued gd <dig> cells . surprisingly, worms fed the gd1:pahg cells suspended in the d-lactic acid rich spent media from gd <dig> cells, lived shorter lives than worms fed gd1:pahg cells suspended in their own spent media . a separate cohort of each plate type was subjected to uv-treatment in order to prevent cells from metabolizing the d-lactic acid in the spent media. as shown in figure 5b, worms do not display a difference in survival when fed uv-treated gd1:pahg cells suspended in either type of spent medium. both results indicate that the excreted components present in gd <dig> e. coli spent media are not responsible for life span extension.

bacterial proliferation in the gut has been implicated as a major contributor of mortality in the worm  <cit> . we speculated that the respiring cells suspended in spent media containing large amounts of d-lactic acid were converting this fermentative product into energy-rich metabolites, fueling proliferation and other cellular functions. to test whether the d-lactic acid in the spent media does supply fuel for growth, we suspended overnight cultures of gd1:pahg cells in either their own spent media, lb media or the spent media from gd <dig> cells. we found that the cells provided the gd <dig> spent media grew nearly as well as cells in lb media, whereas cells suspended in their own spent media showed negligible growth . these results suggested that respiring e. coli cells utilize d-lactic acid and other metabolites present in the spent media as fuel for proliferation. under these conditions, the utilization of d-lactic acid has a negative impact on worm life span .

q deficient e. coli replicate more slowly than wild-type or atp synthase mutant e. coli
bacteria use a large proportion of available energy for replication; the loss of q should lead to slow proliferation compared to wild-type cells. bacterial proliferation inside the worm is known to influence life span  <cit> . the atp synthase mutant strain an <dig> has wild-type q levels but is incapable of utilizing the proton-motive force to produce atp  <cit> . the life span extension in worms fed an <dig> is similar to that of worms fed an e. coli mutant  harboring a deletion of the entire operon encoding atp synthase  <cit> . worms fed the e. coli parental strain  <dig> had life spans indistinguishable from either op <dig> or an <dig>   <cit> . life spans of n <dig> worms fed rescued gd <dig>  or op <dig> are also indistinguishable  <cit> . thus we determined the growth dynamics of representative bacterial strains known to influence life span. gd <dig> e. coli grow more slowly as compared to either op <dig> or an <dig> and also reach saturation at lower cell density . the an <dig> mutant cells show an intermediate rate of growth and cell density at saturation . the bacterial proliferation observed is consistent with the hypothesis that worms fed diets of the slower growing e. coli strains have longer life span.


e. coli deficient in respiration show lower colonization of the worm gut during early- to mid-adulthood
op <dig> e. coli have been previously shown to colonize and proliferate in the worm gut  <cit> . bacterial proliferation in the gut is considered a major contributor to worm mortality  <cit> . similarly, we found that two day-old adult worms fed op <dig> e. coli expressing gfp accumulate bacteria as evidenced by the green fluorescence throughout the gut . this accumulation becomes more pronounced at day  <dig>  and clusters of bacteria form distensions along the intestine. in contrast, worms fed gd <dig> expressing gfp do not show evidence of bacteria in their intestinal tracts at day  <dig> or  <dig>  in fact, the few gfp-expressing bacteria evident in these animals reside only in the anterior part of the pharynx . the apparent lack of passage through the pharynx into the intestine is not influenced by the size of the gd <dig> e. coli, because this strain is indistinguishable from op <dig> in terms of cell size and shape .


at day  <dig> of adulthood, worms fed the atp synthase deficient e. coli an <dig> strain display an intermediate degree of colonization of the intestine as compared to either op50-fed worms or the an <dig> parental strain . interestingly, worms fed an <dig> displayed a diminished gut infiltration pattern as compared to op <dig> at day two of worm adulthood , despite growing to a thicker density on plates . in contrast, from day five of adulthood onward, worms fed an <dig> have intestinal gfp patterns identical to op50-fed worms, indicating that the lag of an <dig> infiltration occurs only during the early stage of worm adulthood .

worms fed op <dig> to the tenth day of adulthood have distended intestinal lumens filled with gfp-labeled bacteria. severe anatomical alterations of the gut deviating from the organ’s previously linear shape are prevalent . nonetheless, the degree of bacterial infiltration of the gut increased only slightly compared to day five animals . by day  <dig>  gd1-fed worms show appreciable amounts of gut bacteria-gfp fluorescence, yet the intestine is still not noticeably distended . in contrast,  <dig> day-old worms fed an <dig> accumulate gut bacteria-gfp fluorescence and acquire the distended gut appearance of worms fed op <dig> . by day  <dig> of adulthood all worms have large portions of the gut distended due to bacterial accumulation, regardless of the diet . every animal assayed at day  <dig> demonstrates intestinal accumulation of e. coli . these results suggest that early accumulation of bacteria in the nematode gut is linked to a shorter nematode life span.

worms fed gd <dig> have decreased coliform counts
these findings indicated that the worms accumulated bacteria in their intestine to different extents depending on their diet. however, this assay was qualitative in nature. to quantify the colony density within the intestinal lumen of individual animals, worm lysates were prepared from animals fed either the op <dig> or gd <dig> diets from time of hatching. the worms were collected at various ages ranging from the l <dig> larval stage to day  <dig> of adulthood and the number of colony-forming units retrieved per worm  determined. the coliform counts varied dramatically between gd <dig> and op50-fed animals. we measured an average of  <dig> cfu/worm in gd1-fed day five adult worms as compared to  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu/worm in age-matched worms fed either op <dig> or an <dig> . worms fed op <dig> reached a saturation point by day five, whereas worms fed gd <dig> showed a linear progression of coliform counts, but did not reach op <dig> counts even by day  <dig> 


interestingly, the cfu/worm in c. elegans fed an <dig> were intermediate as compared to op <dig>  an <dig>  or gd <dig>  particularly at days  <dig> and  <dig> of adulthood . however, day  <dig> and  <dig> adult animals fed an <dig> have similar coliform counts as compared to either op <dig> or an <dig> fed worms .

discussion
the life span of c. elegans fed diets of respiratory deficient e. coli is significantly enhanced as compared to c. elegans fed the standard lab diet of op <dig> e. coli  and  <cit> . these benefits are not confined to long-term survival, because animals fed the gd <dig> bacterial strain fare better than worms fed op <dig> during short-term stress assays such as exposure to the oxidative agent juglone or to high-temperature . the e. coli respiratory deficiency, due to either the lack of q or a deficiency in complex v, mediates worm life span extension and increased stress resistance independent of dietary restriction or the worm q content. worms fed the standard op <dig> e. coli diet have distended guts packed with e. coli and show maximal coliform counts  by day five of adulthood. however, worms fed the q-less gd <dig> e. coli show delayed gut colonization and coliform counts fail to reach maximal levels even by day  <dig>  the findings reported here suggest that the delayed replication of respiratory deficient e. coli in the gut lumen confers a survival benefit to the animal that correlates with the longer worm life span and enhanced stress resistance.

a recent study has suggested that the degree of bacterial colonization of the intestine at day two of c. elegans adulthood can be utilized as a predictor of subsequent worm survival  <dig> –  <dig> days thereafter  <cit> . we have found that this predictive window can be extended to the fifth day of adulthood. it has been previously shown that worms fed op <dig> or an <dig> have similar life spans  <cit> . coliform counts  in animals fed these diets are similar  when assayed at the l <dig> larval stage and throughout adulthood. in contrast, worms fed the atp synthase defective e. coli strain an <dig> yield coliform counts intermediate to op <dig> and gd <dig> until day ten, when the values become similar to those of op50-fed animals . similarly, coliform counts from gd1-fed worms are significantly lower than worms fed any of the other diets at day two, five, or ten of adulthood . these findings suggest that the coliform counts at days two and five are predictive of the enhanced life span in worms fed these diets.

what accounts for the dramatically low coliform counts in the gd1-fed animals? it seems likely that the pharynx, which is responsible for grinding the food taken up by the worm, efficiently breaks down the q-deficient e. coli. this degradation could exert an “abiotic” condition in the guts of animals fed this diet. subsequently, gd1-fed worms begin accumulating bacteria in their guts by day ten of adulthood . the transition from mid to late adulthood marks a shift in pharyngeal function  <cit> . animals become plagued by the effects of sarcopenia, or muscle wasting, as they age  <cit> . the pharynx muscle declines in pumping activity and shows increasing tissue disorder  <cit> . indeed, the pharyngeal pumping rate of worms significantly diminishes between early and mid-adulthood  <cit> . the intestinal colonization patterns of phm <dig> mutant worms, which have a poorly functioning pharynx, indicate that large amounts of bacteria pass through the grinder intact. these animals have life spans considerably shorter than wild-type worms, and concomitantly higher numbers of e. coli in the gut lumen  <cit> . interestingly, bacteria are considered to play only a minor role in the decline of this organ, implying that degeneration of the pharynx was due predominantly to the effects of long-term pumping  <cit> . feeding c. elegans pathogenic bacteria such as salmonella or serratia marcescens degrades performance of the pharyngeal grinder and allows early passage of bacterial cells to the worm intestine  <cit> . our results suggest that the type of e. coli diet can profoundly alter the “functional aging” of the pharynx. we speculate that the q-less e. coli membranes may be especially fragile when subjected to the worm pharyngeal grinder due to the absence of q, which normally serves to maintain membrane stability by acting as a crucial membrane chain-terminating antioxidant  <cit> . taken together, these findings underscore the importance of efficient bacterial degradation, as the number of intact bacteria that make it past the pharyngeal grinder clearly impact worm survival.

replicating bacteria in the gut have already been implicated as a main contributor of worm death  <cit> . worms fed either uv-irradiated or antibiotic-treated op <dig> had increased survival  <cit> . similarly, c. elegans exposed to uv-irradiated enterica faecalis or salmonella displayed greater survival than animals fed viable cells of these pathogenic strains  <cit> . however, worms fed uv-irradiated gd <dig> e. coli exhibited shorter life span than worms fed untreated gd <dig>  <cit> . we have observed enhanced susceptibility of gd <dig> e. coli to uv treatment. we speculate that the uv-treatment of gd <dig> as performed previously  <cit>  actually represents a vast overdose of that required for cell killing, and may result in a toxic food that fails to support larval development . alternatively, it is possible that worms recognize metabolites produced by gd <dig> cells, similarly to those produced by op <dig>  and respond through up-regulation of antimicrobial genes. thus, gd <dig> cells that are able to reside within the gut lumen may act to elicit different worm signaling pathways that control innate immunity and the expression of antimicrobial genes such as lys <dig> <cit> . in our study, the delay in e. coli accumulation of the gut in worms fed gd <dig> confers a survival advantage in the animal, and it will be important to determine whether the gd <dig> diet-mediated longevity effects can be attributed to enhanced intestinal immunity through known signaling pathways  <cit> . the diminished proliferative capacity of the q-deficient e. coli  serves to retard the level of infection in the gut once intact bacterial cells settle within the lumen of the aged worm. therefore, we propose that both q and atp synthase function be considered virulence factors.

both q and atp synthase serve essential functions in respiratory metabolism. a growing body of evidence suggests that bacterial pathogens within the gastrointestinal tract must sense oxygen availability  and their metabolic adaptation to the host environment plays a key role in the expression of virulence factors and in modulating host responses  <cit> . in e. coli arcb senses oxygen availability via the quinone redox status  and tunes aerobic and anaerobic respiratory metabolism through its phosphorylation of arca  <cit> . arca functions as a transcriptional regulator of operons involved in respiratory and fermentative metabolism; arca plays a role in virulence in a wide variety of pathogenic bacteria in animals and humans including the enteric pathogens vibrio cholerae <cit>  and shigella flexneri <cit> . mutations in genes encoding respiratory chain complexes also identify components in pathogens essential for virulence. rat lung fibroblasts exposed to shigella flexneri with mutations in the cytochrome bd oxidase had lower numbers of plaques than fibroblasts infected with the wild-type parental strain  <cit> . brucella abortus, a zoological pathogen that causes spontaneous abortions in cattle, showed attenuated virulence against murine macrophages after the cytochrome bd oxidase gene was disrupted  <cit> . two examples directly underscore the relationship between respiration, proliferation and pathogenicity. burkholderia cenocepacia mutants lacking a functional phenylacetic acid catabolism pathway, which degrades aromatic compounds and shunts electrons into the tca cycle, grow slowly and are less virulent to c. elegans than wild-type b. cenocepacia <cit> . bae and colleagues fed c. elegans mutated staphylococcus aureus generated in a random disruption screen and found that disruption mutants in various tca cycle genes showed attenuated killing activity  <cit> . taken together, the findings presented here and in other model systems identify respiration and energy production as important virulence factors.

our findings indicate that excreted components present in gd <dig> e. coli spent media are not responsible for worm life span extension. gd <dig> excreted large amounts of d-lactic acid into its media during growth . the e. coli ubia mutant, deficient in a different q biosynthetic reaction, also accumulates large amounts of d-lactate under normoxic conditions  <cit> . intriguingly, consumption of lactic acid is beneficial in a variety of organisms. ikeda and colleagues showed that worms lived longer and were more resistant to salmonella enterica infection when fed the d-lactic-acid producing bacteria bifidobacterium sp. or lactobacillus sp., although whether this was due to the lactic acid itself was not shown  <cit> . feeding heat-killed species of lactobacilli increased worm life span, implying that the lactate in these cultures was responsible for the improved survival  <cit> . however, these results are difficult to interpret because the authors compared killed lactobacilli to living op <dig>  it is crucial to consider the stereoisomer of lactic acid provided during these analyses. e. coli produces d-lactic acid under hypoxic conditions  <cit> , whereas c. elegans lactic acid dehydrogenase is considered specific for the l-stereoisomer  <cit> . thus, the worm is incapable of converting the d-lactic acid produced by the bacteria into pyruvate. these considerations clarify the results of the spent media/mixing experiment, because while worms cannot utilize the d-lactic acid present in the spent medium of gd <dig> cultures, rescued gd <dig> e. coli are able to utilize the d-lactic acid . for this reason, the d-lactic acid present in the spent media had no effect on c. elegans life span unless it was provided in combination with respiratory competent e. coli, in which case it led to more bacterial proliferation and a shorter worm life span.

it is becoming clear that certain pathological and aging-related disorders are related to the composition of the intestinal microflora  <cit> . the use of beneficial bacteria to influence the health status of humans is quickly becoming a viable therapeutic option. premature infants given lactobacilli soon after birth show significantly decreased incidents of necrotizing enterocolitis  <cit> . probiotic therapies have an anti-cancer effect in human patients  <cit> , while changes in intestinal microbiota composition were associated with the decreased onset of intestinal tumors in the cancer prone apcmin mouse strain  <cit> . mice fed bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis lived longer than littermates fed a control diet and showed diminished gut inflammation  <cit> . fruit flies require certain bacteria in their guts for healthy metabolism  <cit> . probiotic interventions have yielded promising results in worms  <cit> . a recent study showed that the folate status of the gut microbiome may slow c. elegans aging  <cit> . in the presence of tetracycline, the worms assayed in our study responded well to a mixed diet composed of q-replete and q-deficient e. coli , indicating that the benefit of the gd <dig> diet takes effect even in the presence of respiratory-competent e. coli.

in summary, our study argues that e. coli respiration is a virulence factor of op <dig> e. coli, the standard lab diet of c. elegans. the decreased coliform counts present in worms fed respiratory deficient e. coli may manifest in at least two ways:  the lack of q increases the tendency of the pharyngeal grinder to break apart the e. coli gd <dig> cells;  the respiratory deficiency of both the q-less and atp synthase mutants may render them less able to colonize the gut once the intact bacteria have infiltrated. the delayed accumulation and diminished presence of bacteria in the gut of the animal attenuates the stress encountered by the aging animals, yielding longer-lived worms

CONCLUSIONS
we show that the respiratory deficient e. coli diet imparts not only longer life span, but also increased resistance to thermal stress and juglone treatment. the longevity observed is independent of the worm q content and dietary restriction. we provide evidence that the decreased accumulation of respiratory deficient bacteria in the worm intestine is responsible for the increased longevity observed in c. elegans. the lack of q in particular makes the bacteria more susceptible to degradation at the worm’s pharynx. in summary, we put forward the idea that respiration is a virulence factor that has a profound effect on the ability of e. coli to colonize and harm its host.
