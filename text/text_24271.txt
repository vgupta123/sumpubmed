BACKGROUND
in drosophila, atmospheric oxygen enters the body via the spiracles and then is transported to each segment of the body through an extensive tubular tracheal network. these tubules are initially formed by an invagination of the epithelial cells. this epithelial cell migration is initiated and directed by branchless, the drosophila homolog of the mammalian fibroblast growth factor   <cit> , which acts as a chemoattractant or motogen, and is secreted from the cell clusters surrounding the tracheal placoid in each segment of the body. the tubes cease further extension when the cells at the tips of the tube meet the fgf-secreting cells  <cit> .

the cells with the highest fgf activity take up the leading position at the end of a tracheal branch, whereas the other cells with less fgf activity form the stalk of the branches  <cit> . the tracheal lumens from the primary and secondary branches extend into the cell bodies of terminal cells. at stage  <dig>  near the end of embryogenesis, a single lumen containing branch is formed by the extension of a long cytoplasmic projection from terminal cell along the surface of somatic muscles. during larval development, this single terminal branch ramifies extensively into many additional fine branches that later develop lumens. recent studies show that the par-polarity complex, including par- <dig>  par- <dig>  cdc <dig>  and apkc, is involved in the subcellular branching of terminal cells  <cit> .

most of these tracheal branches supply oxygen to identical sets of targets, but certain branches, such as the visceral branches, tracheate to unique organs and do not develop a repetitive pattern of branching. the density of terminal branches serving a target tissue depends on the oxygen requirements of the tissue  <cit> . a detailed examination of all terminal branches revealed that most of the cells in the body are either directly in contact with or very close to a terminal branch  <cit> . jarecki et al.  demonstrated that hypoxia induces the formation of additional terminal branches through an increase in the branchless fgf levels in the tissues, which correlate well with the density of branches  <cit> . moreover, the over-expression of branchless fgf in the target tissues increases the number of terminal branches, as does hypoxia. centanin and colleagues demonstrated that the hypoxia-induced generation of excess terminal branches is mediated by the accumulation of the hypoxia-inducible factor -α homolog sima in terminal cells, leading to the induction of breathless  <cit> . in addition, drosophila serum responsive factor  or blistered is involved in terminal branching, which is induced by fgf  <cit> . dsrf is necessary for the progression of terminal branching after the initial elongation of the cell and lumen  <cit> . many identified genes related to terminal branching were found in genetic screens with their tracheal expression pattern during embryogenesis. more recently, several studies on the direct identification of genes involved in larval tracheal branching have started to reveal more about the genetic control cascades on the branching mechanism  <cit> .

to gain further insight into the regulation of the formation of tracheal terminal branches during larval stages, we carried out a genetic screen on the kiss collection of p-element enhancer trap mutants with tracheal terminal branching defects, taking advantage of the p-element insertion into genes, which can be identified and cloned relatively easily  <cit> . in the screen, we discovered several mutants that have severe truncation of terminal branches, and in this paper, we studied one of these mutants, called cropped/crp, which encodes the drosophila homolog of the mammalian transcription factor ap- <dig>  we showed that crp acts mainly in terminal cells, and that insertion and point mutations in crp lead to truncation in terminal branches. besides controlling tracheal cellular branching, overexpressing crp leads to increase in cell size and disruption in crp function results in developmental defect and cell death in the eyes and salivary glands. in addition, we show that dmyc may be the upstream regulator of crp in the induction of terminal branching. this study demonstrates that crp, as a downstream regulator of dmyc, is a pleiotropic transcription factor that controls cellular branching, cell growth and apoptosis in various organs during drosophila larval development.

RESULTS
identification and genetic characterization of cropped 
in a genetic screen for mutations that affect the outgrowth of tracheal terminal branches, we identified three independent p enhancer trap mutations that caused a substantial reduction in the number of terminal branches in larvae. one of these mutants, k10415), which we call cropped , is described in this paper. in wild-type animals, the first terminal branches sprout at the end of embryogenesis, and, these branches ramify into extensive networks of fine branches throughout larval life . in homozygous crpk <dig> mutants, the early stages of tracheal development were normal, but most of the terminal branches seldom extend beyond the cell body , similar to what is observed in blistered/pruned mutants . the counting of dorsal branches included only from segments  <dig> to  <dig> because they were clearly visible under the microscope. in 54% of the dorsal branches , only one terminal branch remained, and the ones that did develop  were much shorter than normal; the remainder of the dbs exhibited a less severe and variable reduction in branching. the visceral, ganglionic, and lateral trunk terminal branches were affected similarly; 67% of the lateral g  branch split into two branches but with few finer terminal branches . a tracheal cytoplasmic gfp marker showed that terminal cells in the crpk <dig> mutant extended fewer  cytoplasmic processes than normal   and that many of the processes that formed did not develop an air-filled lumen . the larval terminal branching defect of crpk <dig> resembles that of blistered mutants phenotypically , and like blistered mutants, the crpk <dig> mutant also affected the outgrowth of the first terminal branches of db that form at the end of embryogenesis , suggesting that cropped is necessary for the embryonic and larval tracheal terminal branching. tracheal terminal branches appear to be the only tissue affected, as the other tissues, including the muscles, gut, central nervous system, salivary glands, and imaginal discs, were grossly intact in the mutants.figure  <dig> the tracheal phenotypes of the cropped mutant compared with the blistered/pruned mutant.  a pair of dorsal branches  in a wild-type third-instar larva. the air-filled terminal branches ramify extensively on the dorsal muscles.  the same view of a blistered

the genomic dna flanking the insertion sites of the crpk <dig> allele and five other p alleles was isolated by plasmid rescue. dna sequencing showed that the transposon insertion sites were distributed over  <dig> kbp in the  <dig> f region of the drosophila genome . the high susceptibility of the two introns to transposon insertion suggests that this genomic region is likely accessible chromatin  <cit> . four lines of evidence demonstrate that this transcription unit corresponds to crp. first, all six of the characterized p alleles described above are insertions in this transcription unit, and all of these alleles show patterns of lacz expression in the embryo and larva that are similar to the expression pattern of this transcript . second, genomic dna sequencing of the crp ems allele  and two sibling control strains, l35dh and l35di, identified a nonsense mutation  in the 35fd <dig> allele, which truncates the predicted protein . third, the protein products of this transcription unit were absent in crp35fd <dig> homozygotes . finally, the tracheal phenotype could be mimicked by the expression of a dominant-negative form of this protein in the tracheal tissue .figure  <dig> the structure of the cropped locus and its gene products.  the structure of the crp locus. the positions of p insertions  in crp mutants are shown. the boxes at the bottom show the exons and the black boxes indicate the coding region.  schematics of the primary structure of the cropped and human ap- <dig>  proteins. the bhlh dna-binding and dimerization domain , two leucine zippers , and a region containing a conserved motif letiv  are shown. the percent sequence identity between cropped and hap- <dig> is shown for the regions indicated. the positions of the in-frame initiator codons corresponding to the long  and short  cropped protein isoforms are shown. the mutation of crp

the crp cdna encodes a 631-amino acid  protein with high sequence homology to the human activator protein  <dig> . using the protein sequence of cropped to blast against protein sequences in the protein database  <cit> , we found many orthologs of cropped throughout the animal kingdom. the ap- <dig> protein sequences of  <dig> different species of animals with their genomes sequenced were compared and aligned according to the similarity in the protein sequences using the multiple sequence alignment clustalw program developed by the kyoto university bioinformatics center. based upon their similarity in amino acid sequence, a rooted phylogenetic tree was built on the found ap- <dig> orthologs , and the proteins can be divided into  <dig> major clades: group a, consisting of many species of insects, including all of the drosophila species sequenced as well as lepeophtheirus salmonis  and trichoplax adhaerens ; and group b, a more heterogeneous group encompassing the snail, schistosoma mansoni, the sea squirt, and many species of mammals. among the members with each clade, they have high homology within their conserved domains. all ap- <dig> proteins contain  <dig> highly conserved regions that are present in many species. these four highly conserved motifs are presented in figure 2b and c and they are the basic-helix-loop-helix  domain for dna-binding and dimerization, which is highly conserved among  <dig> species but seven. two conserved leucine zipper domains are present for homodimerization of the protein  <cit> .

drosophila ap- <dig> protein has been characterized biochemically  <cit> . there are two isoforms, a major ~86-kd species and a minor ~78-kd species, the latter of which may result from translation starting with an internal methionine initiation codon. we raised polyclonal rabbit antisera against the recombinant cropped protein , an n-terminal region , and a synthetic peptide representing residues  <dig> to  <dig>  all three of the antisera recognized a major band  in immunoblots of extracts of embryonic and larval tissues . this band was absent in the extracts of crp35fd <dig> mutant embryos . the minor, lower-molecular-weight species  co-migrated with an engineered n-terminal truncation of cropped  that derives from an alternative initiation site expressed under the heat-shock promoter  and that has the same size when it is expressed in a recombinant form in e. coli .

cropped is broadly expressed and localized to both the cytoplasm and nuclei in many larval tissues
the expression pattern of crp in the larva was determined by the in situ hybridization of dissected third-instar larval tissues and the analysis of crp p enhancer-trap markers . the cropped mrna was broadly expressed in the larva . this transcript was expressed at low levels throughout many larval tissues, including the muscles, the fat body, the tracheal system and the epidermis, and at much higher levels in the central nervous system , the endodermal cells of the gut, heart, and many imaginal tissues, . the crp-lacz markers k <dig> and k <dig> showed similar patterns of expression . crp mrna was expressed broadly and at a high level in the cns at the end of embryogenesis . previously, a developmental microarray analysis shows that cropped rna is expressed throughout development, including the pupal and adult stages  <cit> . the immunostaining of larval tissues with the two antisera against the cropped protein showed that this protein was also broadly expressed, with elevated levels of expression in the same tissues as for the cropped mrna. as with the mrna of crp, high expression of cropped was found in many tissues  suggesting that cropped may be required for general functions other than tracheal branching .

the expression levels of crp affect the branching of tracheal terminal cells
to determine whether crp functions in tracheal cells or its target tissues to promote terminal branching, we created transgenes that express a wild-type cropped protein  and a dominant-negative  form  lacking the dna-binding domain. it has been demonstrated that the human ap- <dig> protein can interact with itself to form a dimer but is not able to dimerize with other closely related bhlh proteins, such as e <dig>  <cit> . thus, it is likely that, in vivo, the dn mutant protein would dimerize with the endogenous cropped to cripple the dna binding ability of the complex. when uas-dn-crp was specifically expressed in the whole tracheal system using btl-gal <dig> driver, the number of thicker terminal branches of db from segment  <dig> was reduced to  <dig>  ±  <dig>    while that of wild-type was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . the average number of terminal branches in lg in wild-type larvae was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , whereas in dn-crp expressing larvae the number decreased to  <dig>  ±  <dig>   . these observations demonstrate that dn-crp mimicked the crp loss-of-function phenotype. we also tried expressing crp-specific sirna under the uas control  with the same bs- and btl-gal <dig> drivers at several temperatures from  <dig> to 26°c, and unfortunately the progeny from these crosses did not show any tracheal branching phenotypes .figure  <dig> 
crp functions autonomously in tracheal terminal cells. uas-crp transgenes that express the wt cropped protein  or dn-cropped  were expressed in the tracheal system by btl-gal4

, or muscles by mhc-gal4
. the photomicrographs show db and lg branches in third-instar larvae visualized under dic optics. the insets show the terminal branches at higher magnification. the scale bar =  <dig> μm.



on the other hand, quite unexpectedly, the overexpression of wild-type cropped  using the same driver  phenocopied the crp or dn-crp mutants. because btl-gal <dig> directs the expression of crp in the whole tracheal system, which may affect terminal cells indirectly, we also employed the bs-gal <dig> line, which specifies the expression only to terminal cells and weakly in muscle cells. the phenotypes of the two crp transgenes were identical with those driven by btl-gal <dig> , suggesting that crp functions mainly in terminal cells for cellular branching. since either overexpression of wild-type crp or dn-crp resulted in no terminal branches, we would like to eliminate the possibility that the truncation in terminal branch is an inherent artifact of overexpression of proteins in terminal cells by the gal4-uas system. in all the progeny of the crosses with overexpressing destabilized red fluorescent protein  and actin-gfp by the same driver, all terminal branches examine did not exhibit any phenotypes . in contrast, when crp or dn-crp was expressed in the muscles using the mhc-gal <dig> driver , there was no reduction in the number of terminal branches . we conclude that crp functions mainly in terminal cells to promote the outgrowth of terminal branches.

cropped is involved in controlling cell growth and size
as we tried to express the crp gene in various organs outside of the tracheal system with different gal <dig> drivers to examine whether changing the crp levels can affect the tracheal branching around these organs, we confirmed the levels of cropped protein by immuno-histochemical staining with anti-cropped antibody. it was expressed under the a9-gal driver at very high levels in the salivary glands , central nervous system , and various other organs. surprisingly, we found that the sizes of the salivary glands were larger than those from wild-type larvae . the central nervous system of the larvae was also visibly bulkier in both the brain lobes and the ventral nerve cord . to render the observation statistically reliable, twenty samples of salivary glands and cns were dissected out, and digital photographs were taken for dimension measurement. the average longitudinal dimension of the salivary glands  from the from wild-type larvae was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm  and that from crp-overexpressing larvae was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm . the measurements showed that the length increased  <dig> % and the width increased  <dig> % in the larvae . the diameter of the brain lobe increased by  <dig> %, whereas the length of the ventral nerve cord increased by  <dig> % and the width increased by  <dig> %. these results suggest that an increased cropped protein level increases the size of the organs between 20% to 40%. a similar degree of increase in organ size was reported in mutants of the insulin signaling pathway  <cit> .figure  <dig> cropped controls the sizes of organs and individual cells and not cell number in larvae.  the cropped transgene was expressed at high levels with a9-gal <dig> driver in many tissues in l <dig> larvae. the protein level of cropped in the salivary gland  and nerve cord and imaginal discs  was visualized with the brown stain from horseradish peroxidase bound to the secondary antibody. the salivary glands from wt  and a9-gal <dig> overexpressing the cropped transgene  were dissected from the larvae. the central nervous system from wt  and overexpressing the cropped transgene  were also removed from the larvae for size comparison. the photomicrographs were taken with the same power of magnification, and the pictures on the right were using dark-field microscopy.  the length and width of the salivary glands, brain lobes, and ventral nerve cord were measured. the blue bars were the measurements from wt larvae, and the red bars were from cropped-overexpressing larvae. the errors above the bars were sem. the scale bar =  <dig> μm from a to f. from h to m, the salivary glands and fat body from both wt  and a9-gal <dig> overexpressing cropped
 were stained with dapi to identify the nuclei of the cells. the cells of the salivary glands from wt larvae  and from cropped-overexpressing larvae  are shown under dic optics  and dapi-stained . j and m are photomicrographs of dapi-stained fat body cells. from h to k, the photographs were taken with the same magnification, and the scale bar indicates  <dig> μm.  the quantitation of the number of nuclei from the salivary glands of the two types of larvae.



as exemplified by the various mutants of the insulin signaling pathway, increases in organ size in endoreplicating tissues, such as the tracheal cells, are primarily due to increases in cell size rather than cell number, but it was also possible that cropped was affecting the cell number. to differentiate whether this gene affects cell size, cell number or both, the salivary glands dissected from crp-overexpressing and wild-type larvae were fixed and stained with 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole  to localize the nucleus of each cell . the number of bright fluorescent nuclei in the salivary glands from  <dig> larvae was counted. the mean number of nuclei in the salivary glands of the wild-type larva was  <dig>  whereas that of larvae with a high level of cropped protein was  <dig> . a similar increase in the size was observed in the cells of the fat body . these results suggest that crp induces the formation of large salivary glands by increasing the cell size and not much affecting the cell number.

loss of cropped dna binding ability leads to inhibition of cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in the trachea and salivary glands
during the examination of tracheal branching phenotype of overexpressing dn-crp in the tracheal system with the btl-gal <dig> driver, we found that 62%  of the l <dig> and l <dig> larvae displayed a very severe phenotype in which the dorsal trunks of the larvae were collapsed . with the aid of the fluorescence signal from the nuclear gfp expressed in the whole tracheal system, there were just  <dig> to  <dig> cells along db and the last cells could still attach to the somatic muscles , but no terminal cells and fusion cells were observed. this indicates that dn-crp expressed in the tracheal system may have adversely affected the normal development of db.figure  <dig> expression of dominant-negative cropped leads to missing cells and disruption of organ development.  overexpressing dn-crp by using btl-gal <dig> in the tracheal system led to disruption of the formation of terminal and fusion cells ; the arrow heads point to the ends of dbs.  larvae show a collapse in dorsal trunk.  are fluorescence images of gfp-labeled tracheal cells and  are the same field under dic optics.  expression of dn-crp in the salivary glands driven by a9-gal <dig> shrank the organs  compared with control  under the same magnification.  staining assay on the cells expressing crp and dn-crp in the salivary glands for apoptosis with changes in permeability by pi  and breakage of dna strands by the tunel assay . dic photomicrographs  and fluorescence microscopy  were taken under the same magnification.  scanning electron micrographs of the ommatidia expressing dn-crp or wt crp driven by gmr-gal <dig>   the anterior of the fly is pointing to the left and the posterior to the right. dn-crp inhibited the formation of ommatidia and bristles in the posterior half of the eyes and wt crp caused overgrowth of groups of ommatidia. the white arrowheads indicate groups of protruding ommatidia in  and the yellow arrowheads points to the posterior end of the eye without any ommatidia. scanning micrographs at higher magnification of the ommatidia from wt , wt crp- , and dn-crp-expressing fly  are shown.  electron micrograph taken from the dorsal side of the eye of dn-crp expressing fly and the anterior is to the left. scale bars are  <dig> μm ,  <dig> μm ,  <dig> μm , and  <dig> μm .



when dn-crp was expressed in the salivary gland driven by a9-gal <dig>  the glands shrank into a much smaller and shorter organ  when compared with the wild-type salivary glands . the shortened salivary glands contained only  <dig> ±  <dig>  cells , while the wild-type glands contained  <dig> ±  <dig>  cells . it is obvious to observe that the sizes of individual cells in dn-crp expressing glands were much smaller than those of the wild-type and the same is true for the sizes of their nuclei , indicating that crp may have affected cell growth and thus probably endoreplication. moreover, the decrease in cell number in the glands suggests that dn-crp may inhibit the development of the glands by either slowing down the cell proliferation rate or by enhancing apoptosis of the cells.

to demonstrate whether cell viability plays a role in decreasing the number of cells in crp- and dn-crp-expressing salivary glands, we stained the freshly dissected salivary glands from the larvae with propidium iodide  without any fixation to observe the presence of dying cells, which are permeable to pi. most of the glands from crp-overexpressing larvae did not stain with pi  and all the glands from dn-crp expressing larvae were stained positively with pi , suggesting that the smaller gland size may be due to the non-viability of the cells caused by overexpression of dn-crp. to confirm whether the decrease in viability is caused by apoptosis, the tunel assay was employed. similar to the results of pi staining, only the salivary glands from dn-crp expressing larvae stained positively with the tunel reagent while crp expression did not give any signals . in addition, we stained these gland cells with cleaved caspase- <dig> antibody to examine whether the caspase- <dig> dependent apoptotic pathway is activated. the signals from the antibody staining in both crp- and dn-crp expressing gland cells were all negative , suggesting that dn-crp expression caused suppression in both cell growth and number by increasing apoptosis in a caspase- <dig> independent manner.

to examine whether crp expression affects eye development, ectopic expression of dn-crp driven by gmr-gal <dig> in the eye imaginal discs led to a gradient of defects of the ommatidia and bristles on the posterior half of the adult eyes . the most posterior end of the eyes bore no ommatidia and bristles, whilst closer to the midline only ommatidia were found without any bristles. the anterior side of the eyes contained both round ommatidia and normal bristles as wild-type . in contrast, the pattern of ommatidia from flies bearing overexpressing crp was slightly disorganized, and each ommatidium appeared slightly more bulky than wild-type . occasionally, groups of them appeared more protruding in the dorsal half of the eyes of every adult flies   and, intriguingly, the growth of bristles associated within the eyes was suppressed . the results from these experiments show that inhibition of the transcriptional activity of cropped  resulted in the loss of cells in many organs, including terminal cells, salivary glands, and the eyes. however, the outcomes of crp overexpression would depend on the cell type or tissue; it inhibited the differentiation of terminal cells and the eye bristles, but it induced excessive cell growth of the salivary glands and ommatidia.

dmyc activates crp expression and induces terminal branching
recently, it has been demonstrated that, in mammals, the ap- <dig> gene is regulated by c-myc  <cit> . we hypothesized that this regulatory hierarchy may be conserved in drosophila. it has been shown that, in dm  mutants, both the cells and the organisms are smaller than the wild-type, whereas dmyc overexpression increases cell size  <cit> . therefore, we assumed that if dm acts upstream of crp, then changes in dm expression should have a tracheal branching phenotype. we tested this notion by overexpressing dm in terminal cells with bs-gal <dig> and observing any morphological changes in tracheal branching. the overexpression of dm in terminal cells did not increase the number of thicker terminal branches but instead it increased the formation of fine terminal branches  of db  and lg  branches compared with the bs-gal <dig> strain . however, the increase in the formation of short, fine branches occurred mainly near the terminal cell body . in addition, some of the thick terminal branches appeared more tortuous and the air-filled lumens of these branches were not even in diameter  , which are similar to the effects of overexpressing bnl or of hypoxia  <cit> . in contrast, the expression of short interfering double-strand rna of dm in terminal cells by bs-gal <dig> resulted in the truncation of terminal branches similar to that of the crp mutants and dn-crp- or crp-overexpressing larvae .figure  <dig> the induction of dmyc  increases terminal branching and activates crp expression.  the terminal branches of db  and lg  of l <dig> larvae were observed. ectopic expression of dmyc in terminal cells with bs-gal <dig> resulted in the formation of excessive and tortuous terminal branches of the db  and lg  compared with those of larvae without uas-dm . depletion of endogenous c-myc by expressing sirna against dm induced truncation of both db  and lg . the scale bar indicates  <dig> μm.  dmyc induced crp promoter activity. s <dig> cells transfected with the plasmid expressing firefly luciferase gene downstream of the crp promoter fragment, the plasmid expressing dmyc or dmyc without the dna binding region , and the renilla luciferase expressing plasmid  for  <dig> hours and then harvested for reporter gene assays. the ratio of firefly luciferase to renilla luciferase luminescence signal was calculated and fold changes of luciferase activity relative to vector control are shown. values are represented as mean ± sem from four independent experiments. ** indicates p value < <dig> , *** indicates p value < <dig> .  overexpression of dmyc in larvae with the genotype hs-gal4;
uas-dmyc was observed after exposing the larvae to 35°c for  <dig> min. crp, dmyc, and actin were visualized by western blots using their specific antibodies.



to examine whether dm can regulate crp expression and tracheal branching, the genomic dna sequences of crp from  <dig> different species of drosophila, including d. melanogaster, d. simulans, d. yakuba, d. erecta, d. virilis, and d. pseudoobscura, were aligned using clustalw, and the e-boxes of both myc and ap- <dig> were located . a single canonical c-myc-binding site  was present at  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the translation start site  of the crp gene in four species of drosophila, whereas the dmyc binding site was located  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides upstream from the atg site in d. virilis and d. pseudoobscura, respectively. the conservation of the dmyc binding site in different species suggests that dm may be able to regulate crp expression.

to demonstrate that dmyc can transactivate crp, we transfected the plasmid expressing the dmyc gene under the control of the actin 5c promoter, pgl <dig>  plasmid containing the promoter sequence  of the crp gene cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase gene, and the renilla luciferase expressing plasmid, pac <dig> c-rluc-v5-his <dig>  into drosophila s <dig> cells. the renilla luciferase activity was used for the normalization of transfection efficiency. when dmyc was expressed, the relative luciferase activity was 5-fold higher compared than control , while dominant-negative dmyc  only slightly induced the luciferase activity from the same promoter . the high induction of crp promoter activity was observed over the control transfection, suggesting that dmyc is a strong inducer of the crp gene transcriptional activity.

to observe whether the same transcriptional relationship between dmyc and crp in vivo, we induced the expression of dmyc in l <dig> larvae harboring both heat shock-gal <dig>  and uas-dm transgenes by heating at 35°c for  <dig> minutes. the increase in dmyc protein expression after the heat shock resulted in the induction of cropped protein, as visualized by western blotting . these experiments suggest that dmyc functions similarly to its mammalian counterpart in activating the expression of crp to control tracheal branching.

discussion
in the present study, we used an enhancer-trap genetic screen to find novel genes that are involved in the development of tracheal terminal branching at the larval stage of drosophila. in this paper, we described one of the three mutants that exhibit truncated terminal branches, the cropped mutant. molecular cloning and analysis showed that the mutated gene, cropped, encodes the drosophila homolog of the mammalian transcription factor ap- <dig>  the human ap- <dig> protein was discovered by its ability to bind to the long terminal repeat  sequences of the sv <dig> genome  <cit> . recently, it has been implicated in cell proliferation  <cit> , but its molecular functions remain largely elusive.

results from biochemical experiments demonstrated that the human ap- <dig> protein can only form homodimers via the two leucine zipper domains and that it binds to the e-box sequence  <cit> . the nucleotide sequence bound by cropped in drosophila has been shown to be identical to the human counterpart  <cit> . in the literature, there are a myriad of genes that are decorated with ap- <dig> binding sequences, both upstream of promoters and within introns; however, only a few studies have demonstrated the direct binding of ap- <dig> to the sequence and the functions of the genes involved. the mammalian ap- <dig> has been described, in certain cases, as an activating factor  <cit> , and as a repressor in other physiological contexts  <cit> . the only protein known to interact with cropped/ap- <dig> is daughterless, which is also an hlh protein, but the physiological significance of the interaction between daughterless and cropped in the salivary gland is not clear  <cit> .

cropped is necessary for tracheal terminal branching
in the present study, we showed that cropped is necessary for the formation of tracheal terminal branches in both the embryonic and larval stages. to inactivate the functions of the endogenous ap- <dig> protein, we expressed dn-crp in various tissues to elucidate its functions in vivo. when either wt or dn-crp was expressed in the tracheal tissues, the formation of terminal branches was impeded, but this effect was not observed for expression in the muscles, suggesting that crp acts mainly in the tracheal tissues for tracheal branching. the cytoplasmic extensions of the terminal branches, as visualized by the presence of gfp expressed in the tracheal tissues, were much less extensive but still present. the air-filled lumen in the terminal branches extended only slightly beyond the locations of the terminal cell bodies. moreover, the number of viable homozygous cropped mutant larvae is less than expected, and the homozygotes seldom develop into flying adults, implying that crp mutants may be lethal due to the impairment of gas exchange or probably cell growth as discussed below.

functions of the cropped protein outside the tracheal system
the requirement of the cropped protein only in the trachea cells for the formation of the tracheal terminal branches appears to contradict our observation that both the protein and mrna expression of cropped are ubiquitous in both embryonic and larval bodies. because the expression patterns of cropped and branchless are very similar, we expected that overexpression of crp in tissues other than the trachea  might increase branching by stimulating branchless expression. however, we did not observe any changes in branching and coverage. instead, an increase in the size of the salivary glands and central nervous system was observed by overexpression of wt crp. in addition to an obvious increase in cell dimensions, the quantification of the cell number in the salivary glands suggests that cropped controls the cell size but not the cell number. this observation is consistent with the finding in a study that shows that dap- <dig> regulates cell size using a genome-wide rnai methodology  <cit> .

it has recently been demonstrated that mammalian ap- <dig> is involved in cell proliferation and is under the control of myc  <cit> . this report is consistent with the finding that dmyc can also affect cell growth and proliferation in drosophila. similar to c-myc, the increase in size of the cell and nucleus in cropped-overexpressing tissues suggests that dap- <dig> may be involved in endoreplication, in which the cells grow without undergoing mitosis or cytokinesis  <cit> . looking for evidence that crp is controlled by dmyc, as in mammals ap- <dig> is controlled by c-myc, we found that there is a strong conservation of a single myc-binding sequence, cacgtg, upstream of the translation start site  in  <dig> species of drosophila. overexpression of dmyc in drosophila s <dig> cells enhanced 5-fold the relative promoter activity of crp compared with control , showing that dmyc can indeed drive the expression of crp. since dmyc has been shown to increase cell size in vivo and cropped controls both cell growth and tracheal branching, we hypothesized that dmyc would also increase tracheal branching if dmyc acts upstream of crp to increase cell growth. indeed, higher levels of dmyc in terminal cells resulted in an increase in the number and tortuosity of tracheal branches, similar to that caused by the overexpression of bnl or after hypoxic exposure  <cit> . in addition, the overexpression of dmyc protein induced the expression of cropped. these experiments support the notion that cropped/ap- <dig> is a downstream target of dmyc and that both of these proteins are involved in cell growth and tracheal branching in drosophila.

a link between cell growth and tracheal branching
it was initially quite perplexing how cropped controls tracheal terminal branching and controls another seemingly unrelated process, cell growth. the answer would be more apparent if one considers that the numerous terminal outgrowths in each branch are originated from a single terminal cell. each terminal cell only harbors a single, short terminal branch in embryo and ramifies the branch to numerous cytoplasmic extensions in all different directions on the tissues they contact during the larval stage. terminal cells need to increase not only the surface for gaseous exchange but also its own cell size to cover the target tissues. as we found that the cropped gene and cropped protein are expressed at high levels in many tissues including the nervous tissues during both embryogenesis and the larval stages, we hypothesize that other cell types, such as neurons and endothelial cells, may utilize a similar process in increasing the cell size and cellular content of the growth cone to extend towards their targets.

this process could be visualized as a case of the simplification and coordination of molecular functions, in which cropped protein acts as both a cell type-specific transcription factor in controlling tracheal terminal branching and as an activator of cell growth under the control of the same signaling mechanism. with an ample supply of nutrients, such as glucose and amino acids, many endocycling tissues in larvae undergo cell growth  <cit> . branchless/fgf activates the mapk pathway, which induces the cropped protein in many tissues to grow in cell size. at the same time, the cell growth mechanism mediated by the dmyc-crp axis also occurs in terminal cells to increase in cellular branches. by this argument, the control of the two different physiological processes, cell growth and branching, can be coordinated by the same signaling mechanism in terminal cells.

angiogenesis in mammals is a process that is analogous to insect tracheogenesis in function and molecular mechanism  <cit> ; therefore, we speculate that the mammalian ap- <dig> protein may function in a similar fashion in angiogenesis. during angiogenesis, new blood vessels branch out onto hypoxic target tissues due to the proliferation and migration of the tip endothelial cells via the attraction of angiogenic chemoattractants, such as vegf or fgf  <cit> . the growth of the endothelial cells towards the target tissues involves cell division and cell growth of the tip cells, but the insect tracheal terminal cells increase in cell size by endoreplication to attain full coverage of the oxygen-starved target tissues.

CONCLUSIONS
transcription factor ap- <dig> or cropped is expressed ubiquitously in almost every cell in the larvae of drosophila. the functions of the cropped gene in terminal cells of the tracheal system are regulating cell growth and cellular branching. cropped may also affect the development of the ommatidia and salivary glands in their cell size and numbers depending on the levels of cropped expression.
