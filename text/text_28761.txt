BACKGROUND
mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis  is an intracellular pathogen that causes johne’s disease, a chronic  intestinal inflammation in cattle, sheep, goats and other ruminants  <cit> . when map is shed into the environment from an infected host, its survival is finite, with no evidence of bacterial replication  <cit> , indicating that the definitive host of map is the ruminant species in which it has co-evolved. in contrast, the closely-related organism, m. avium subspecies hominissuis , is considered an environmental generalist, as it can be isolated and propagated in a variety of reservoirs, including water sources and biofilms . how map has evolved into a professional pathogen remains largely unknown.

in other bacterial pathogens such as escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, shigella flexneri, and yersinia enterocolitica, the transfer of dna from one organism to another member of a different species has been shown to contribute to the emergence of virulent strains. interestingly, in many cases the transferred dna contains clusters of genes known as pathogenicity islands that enable the recipient strain to adapt to the host environment . in the case of map, the completion of the genome sequences of map k <dig> and mah  <dig> has greatly enabled the derivation of an evolutionary model for the emergence of map  <cit>  along with the identification of map-specific genomic islands that are absent in mah  <cit>  . although horizontal gene transfer  has been detected in mycobacteria , the functional consequence of acquiring these novel genetic elements is currently unknown in this genus. in this study, we wished to examine whether map-specific genomic fragments contribute to the survival of map within the host.

mutagenesis-mediated approaches have been employed extensively with great success for the determination of conditionally essential genes in a number of bacterial pathogens including mycobacterium tuberculosis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella species, vibrio cholerae, and neisseria meningitidis. previous studies employing the transposon  mutagenesis strategy have identified map genes involved in metabolism and host adaptation using selected, genetically-defined mutants . these studies indicate the feasibility of mutagenizing this organism with the purpose of conducting unbiased, genome-wide scale screens of conditionally essential genes of map. in this study, we have used high-throughput illumina sequencing to characterize transposon libraries and identify genes whose disruption is deleterious for in vivo survival. in particular, we were interested in whether map-specific genes  were over- or under-represented in genes predicted to contribute to survival in vitro or in vivo. our data suggest that map-specific genes are dispensable for in vitro survival yet over-represented in genes required for map persistence in the mouse model. these findings present a methodology that can be readily applied to selected experimental conditions, including infection of natural mammalian hosts of map.

as described in the methods section, we generated  <dig> independent sets of output:input ratios for all sites. when these ratios were compared across experiments, a correlation coefficient of ~  <dig>  to  <dig>  was seen when comparing the ratios from outputs 1-4; in contrast, output  <dig> data revealed a much lower correlation coefficient when compared to each of the other  <dig> experiments . as a result, output  <dig> was removed from downstream analysis. each gene was assigned an output to input ratio, and the median of these ratios was  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for the  <dig> output pools. to tease out genes important for in vivo fitness, we examined genes, that when disrupted, resulted in mutants with an output to input ratios less than  <dig>  × average median of that experiment, reasoning that these genes would represent priority candidates for future targeted investigation. we identified a total of  <dig> depleted mutants at this threshold; while the expected number of depleted lspp mutants was  <dig>  we observed  <dig>  demonstrating that the lspp genes were over-represented in genes important for in vivo fitness. we tested two additional thresholds,  <dig>  × median and  <dig>  × median, and the results are summarized in table  <dig>  the odds ratio of lspp gene disruption and in vivo depletion at  <dig>  × median was  <dig> . lspp genes that were depleted in vivo at  <dig>  × median are listed in table  <dig>  lists of depleted genes at various median thresholds are presented in additional file  <dig> table  <dig>

discussion
to unambiguously investigate the essentiality of individual genes on a genome-wide scale, the present study generated a large transposon mutant pool  that was subjected to in vivo selection . high-throughput illumina sequencing technology was used to determine the exact position of transposon insertion site, and the number of reads at each insertion site in the input and output pools were then analyzed to identify the gene set important for map survival inside a mammalian host. our data indicate that map-specific genes were under-represented in genes required for survival in vitro but over-represented among those predicted to contribute to survival in vivo, with both results highly statistically significant. furthermore, our data identified map genes that are conserved across other mycobacterial species whose disruption resulted in an inability to survive in vivo, potentially offering candidate genes for the generation of live, attenuated vaccines.

of the  <dig> genes in the map genome,  <dig>  genes were disrupted by the transposon, indicating that we did not achieve 100% saturation in our input pool. while some of genes are presumably essential in vitro, and cannot be disrupted, our result fell short of expectations and suggested that we had incomplete disruption coverage of the genome. although we harvested ~  <dig> clones for the input pool, we only achieved ~  <dig> unique transposon insertion mutants. this phenomenon was likely due to a bottlenecking effect during sample preparation or sequencing stage. this sparse disruption frequency prevented us from calling essential domains within a gene with statistical confidence. to address this issue in future studies, we will generate more independent libraries to maximally saturate the number of transposon insertions, which would allow us to study not only at the gene level but also intergenic regions and domains required for optimal growth under different conditions. nonetheless, the assessment of these  <dig> genes, including  <dig> map-specific genes, provides the first comprehensive portrait of genes required for survival of map, in vitro and in vivo. this method can now be readily applied to defined culture conditions that are deemed representative of the life cycle of map or to in vivo infections of the natural host, to test whether there are host-specific essential genes in the map genome.

map-specific genes are distributed on  <dig> genomic islands known as large sequence polymorphisms   <cit> . these gene clusters are absent in m. avium subsp. hominissuis , the putative ancestor of map and a generally non-pathogenic strain  <cit> , thus we were particularly interested in assessing whether the presence of these genes have increased map’s fitness as a professional pathogen. indeed, we observed nearly twice as many lspp mutants to be depleted than expected after animal infection and our results indicated that these findings were not clustered to  <dig> island, but rather pertained to each of these  <dig> genome islands. of note, different groups, using different comparison strains and technical platforms, have estimated the precise number of map-specific genes differently. using the set of map-specific genes described by castellanos et al. <cit>  which comprises  <dig> map-specific genes including the  <dig> lspp genes identified by alexander et al.  <cit> , we observed  <dig> disrupted genes, and  <dig> were depleted after the in vivo challenge. the enrichment was higher than expected  and the odds ratio of map-specific gene disruption and in vivo attenuation was  <dig>  in this case, showing a similar trend as our previous analysis.

within lspp <dig>  map0856c shares no homology with any known protein; the closest orthologue of map <dig> is found in acidothermus cellulolyticus, a cellolytic thermophilic actinobacterium  <cit> . of particular interest, the disruption of map <dig> led to complete absence of mutants carrying this mutation in all outputs. map <dig> is conserved in the cell division protein ftsk in streptomyces violaceusniger. in m. tuberculosis, ftsk  is essential for in vitro growth  <cit>  and has been predicted to be involved in cell division  <cit> .

genes found to be depleted in lspp <dig> include: map <dig>  with a phage integrase orthologue in geodermatophilus obscurus, a bacterium often found in stressful environments  <cit> ; map <dig> and map <dig>  each likely encodes a transposase; map2154c and map <dig> have no known function or orthologue in another organism.

within lspp <dig>  map2185c was found to be important for in vivo growth; it shares homology with an amidohydrolase found in frankia, a genus of bacteria that are nitrogen-fixing and often plant symbionts  <cit> . another gene, map <dig> is part of the mammalian cell entry  operon. in m. tuberculosis, the mce genes are known to facilitate mycobacterial cell entry and thus virulence factors  <cit> . the mce gene clusters are predicted to function as atp-binding cassette  transporters for cholesterol , a substrate implicated in map pathogenesis  <cit> .

lspp <dig> constitutes the largest map-specific genomic island, and contains several blocks predicted to mediate functions such as metal acquisition and synthesis of metabolic and transport proteins  <cit> . in this study, map3731c, map3733c, and map3735c were found to be depleted in the output pool. they are part of an inorganic metal uptake functional unit that spans map3731c to map3736c. strikingly the attenuated vaccine strain 316 f has been reported to have a deletion spanning map3714-map3735c <cit> ; this region has therefore been independently linked to in vivo survival by both gene deletion and tn-induced gene disruption. in addition, map3734c-3736c have been found to be upregulated during bovine epithelial cells and macrophages  <cit>  while a transcriptomic study found that map3731-3736c were downregulated in infected bovine tissues  <cit> . map <dig> to map <dig> has been predicted to be involved in siderophore biosynthesis; disruption in map <dig>  map <dig>  map <dig> all resulted in reduction in the output pool. as the first gene involved in mycobacterial siderophore  biosynthesis is truncated in map k- <dig>  <cit> , it is of great interest to elucidate the function of this genetic element. another set of depleted genes consisted of map <dig> and map <dig>  encoding membrane protein mmps <dig> and mmpl <dig>  other depleted genes include map3757c, a probable leucyl-trna synthetase, map <dig> a transposase, map3760c a predicted methylase and two adjacent genes, map3763c, and map3764c, predicted to code for proteins involved in polyketide synthesis   <cit> .

lspp <dig> contains a putative metal uptake operon with a ferric uptake regulator -like transcriptional regulator. in our study we identified disruption in map3776c, the first gene in this genomic region led to depletion in the output. map3776c encodes the solute-binding portion of an abc transporter and is found to be downregulated in infected tissue  <cit> . the functional characterization of this operon is currently underway in our laboratory. finally, lspp <dig> contained two depleted genes, map <dig> which encodes a phage integrase, and map3817c which encodes a protein possibly involved in thiamine biosynthesis  <cit> .

compared to two previous studies that screened map transposon libraries for attenuated mutants, we also observed depletion  of map <dig>  map <dig>  map <dig>  map <dig>  map2205c, map <dig>  and map <dig> in the output pool. both studies used atcc strain  <dig> and different infection models   <cit> , and the consistency between these studies and our data suggests that these genes are very likely to be important for the survival of map in a mammalian host. table  <dig> lists genes in which disruption resulted in complete absence in the output pool. a closer examination of these genes revealed that some of them are essential for in vitro growth in m. tuberculosis. a possible explanation is that our input pool was only passaged in rich growth medium  once, thus mutants with disruption in these essential genes were not completely eliminated but potentially growing poorly prior to infection.

to our knowledge, the present study is the first report that describes the assessment of conditionally important genes in map at a genome-wide scale. as map is a very slow-growing and fastidious microorganism, this transposon-mediated screen offers a powerful and unbiased tool for identifying the genetic basis for survival of map within a mammalian host. further functional characterization of these promising candidates will undoubtedly shed light on the metabolism, genetic regulation, and virulence of map.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study demonstrates that map-specific genes are over-represented in genes required for map to survive in vivo, but under-represented for its growth in vitro. our finding provides support for the notion that horizontally transferred genetic elements specific to map contributed to its emergence as a professional pathogen. in addition, genes identified as essential for growth of map in vitro and in vivo present as potential targets for therapeutic development.
