BACKGROUND
pyridoxal 5′-phosphate , a derivative of vitamin b <dig>  is one of the most versatile organic cofactors in biology. in fact, plp-dependent enzymes form a vast and complex group of proteins present in organisms belonging to all levels of the tree of life  <cit>  and participate in a variety of reactions . in humans, for example, besides the classical role in transamination, many of these enzymes take part in the metabolism of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, glycine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, d-serine, l-glutamate, γ-amino butyric acid and histamine  <cit> . plp-dependent enzymes have been classified in at least five evolutionarily unrelated families, characterized by specific three-dimensional folds  <cit> . many studies have been devoted to the elaboration of a rigorous classification of plp enzymes, with the aim to identify their common structural features and to understand how different protein scaffolds can support similar substrate binding in the active sites  <cit> . among the different structural classes, the so-called fold type i  <cit>  is the most populated in nature and the best characterized one. the subunit architecture of the fold includes one large and one small domain. the large domain contains a seven stranded β-sheet interacting with α-helices. the small domain at the c-terminal part of the chain folds as a three- or four-stranded β-sheet partly covered with helices. plp-enzymes belonging to the fold type i, are known to exist as stand-alone proteins either homodimers or homotetramers. the active site is located in a crevice between the two domains at the subunit interface. the archetypal protein of this class is aspartate aminotransferase  <cit>  which was the first plp-dependent enzyme to be purified and crystallized. since then, intense research work has been carried out to elucidate the details of its structural and functional properties.

scrutiny of sequence data produced by genomic projects showed that fold type i domains can be found in multidomain frameworks, in prokaryotic systems, such as the transcriptional regulator mocr  <cit>  and also in multienzyme systems, polyketide synthases  and nonribosomal peptide synthetases , involved in the biosynthesis of polyketides , nonribosomal peptides  and hybrid pk/nrp secondary metabolites. a vast array of bioactive metabolites belonging to these classes includes also several important medicinal agents and biotechnologically relevant compounds  <cit> . the canonical biosynthetic mechanisms of the two classes of structurally different secondary metabolites, polyketides  and nonribosomal peptides , share several common features. both nrps and pks type i systems require the participation of multienzyme complexes acting as assembly lines for the construction of polyketide or peptide chains by a sequence of condensation steps. in both systems each elongation step is catalyzed by a module containing the catalytic domains required for the insertion of a monomer into the growing chain. the first step in the biosynthetic pathway, is the atp-dependent adenylation of the amino acid catalyzed by an adenylation domain  in the nrps systems and the transfer of the acyl-group from an acyl-coa onto the acyltransferase unit  in the pks systems. the monomer is then transferred to a carrier protein  post-translationally primed with a phosphopantetheine arm, called thiolation domain  or peptidyl carrier protein  in nrps and acyl carrier protein  in pks multienzyme assemblies, respectively. in both systems, the carrier proteins mediate the transport of intermediates, linked by a thioester bond to the phosphopantetheine arm, along the assembly line. in nrps systems, the key elongation reaction is the peptide bond formation by a nucleophilic attack of the α-amino group of the amino acid tethered to the downstream thiolation domain on the thioester bond of the intermediate tethered to the upstream peptidyl carrier protein, catalyzed by a condensation domain . in pks assembly lines the elongation relies on the ketosynthase  catalyzed carbon-carbon bond formation, by a claisen condensation mechanism between the upstream acyl thioester and the downstream carbanionic acyl acceptor resulting from decarboxylation of malonyl- or methylmalonyl-acp. the release of the product in both systems is usually catalyzed by a thioesterase  domain located in the termination module and in most cases involves a macrocyclization; however different mechanisms have also been reported  <cit> . in addition to these two distinct biosynthetic mechanisms, there is a large number of mixed clusters involved in the production of structurally complex compounds where both polyketide and peptide moieties can be recognized. the modular architecture and functional versatility makes possible the switching between nrps and pks assembly lines.

in nrps, pks and hybrid systems, besides the essential aforementioned catalytic domains, the presence of additional “tailoring domains”, which introduce structural modifications into the canonical building blocks and contribute to the amazing structural diversity in nrp and pk metabolites, is frequently observed. these domains can be encoded within the biosynthetic gene clusters, either fused to other catalytic domains or as self-standing domains  <cit> . their activities range from hydroxylation, halogenation, methylation, racemization, heterocyclization, lipidation and glycosilation. several plp-dependent proteins were also identified in multimodular biosynthetic machineries, some operating as self-standing domains, others incorporated in multidomain enzymes containing at least one carrier protein. examples of plp-dependent enzymes postulated to be involved in the formation of building blocks are found in the biosynthesis of peptidyl nucleoside antibiotic pacidamycin: pace and pacs belonging to the type ii fold, and pact belonging to the type i fold  <cit> . a plp-dependent protein is involved in an interesting and very unusual chain releasing mechanism in the biosynthesis of the fungal polyketide mycotoxin fumonisin, namely by incorporation of two carbons and one amino group from alanine into the acyl chain  <cit> . a stand-alone plp dependent enzyme, mxcl, is hypothesized to participate in the final step of the biosynthesis of myxochelin b, the catecholate siderophore produced by stigmatella aurantiaca sg a <dig>  <cit> , namely in the transamination of the aldehyde group present in the late biosynthetic intermediate. the insertion of an amino group into a polyketide biosynthetic precursor by transamination of the carbonyl function is a process operating also in the biosynthesis of antimicrobial polyamino antibiotics zeamines produced by serratia plymuthica rvh <dig>  <cit> . in particular, the gene zmn <dig> present in the complex biosynthetic cluster of this compound, encodes a protein containing a domain with a putative aminotransferase activity, homologous to the type i plp–dependent glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase.

the functionally characterized plp-dependent domains belonging to fold type i which operate in cis within mixed nrps/pks multienzyme systems are those involved in the biosynthesis of the potent antifungal cyclic lipopeptide mycosubtilin  <cit>  and of the tripyrrolic metabolite prodigiosin  <cit> . in the biosynthesis of mycosubilin  <cit> , an aminotransferase domain  embedded within the pks/nrps hybrid enzyme myca and located at the interface of the pks and nrps modules, catalyzes the incorporation of an amine group from the amine donor, gln, into the protein-bound plp and subsequently to the β-ketothioester tethered to the acp domain of the polyketide moiety. a different role of a plp domain was established in the formation of prodigiosin belonging to the family of tripyrrole red pigments prodiginines produced by serratia and streptomyces bacterial strains, which are attracting increasing interest because of their immunosuppressive, anticancer, antimicrobial, and antimalarial activities. the plp-dependent domain, sert, located on a module containing also two acp domains, pigh, is predicted to generate a c <dig> fragment by decarboxylation of l-serine, which is then used for pyrrole b ring formation  <cit> .

in this paper, we focus specifically on plp-dependent domains of fold type i occurring covalently linked in multidomain frameworks related to nrps and/or pks-like assemblies in bacterial systems. since the identification of these domains is relatively recent, we undertook an in silico analysis with the aim to contribute to the clarification of some aspects concerning their function, structural remodeling and relationship to the homologous, traditional plp-dependent enzymes.

RESULTS
construction of the hidden markov model representative of fold type i plp enzymes
we have expanded the non-redundant set of proteins belonging to the fold type i family  already reported  <cit> . twelve new structures were included to obtain a total of  <dig> fold type i proteins aligned . the structurally conserved regions  <cit>  belonging to the large and small domain of the type i monomer have been identified. since the small domain is the most variable among the fold type i proteins, the alignment portion used in the hmm profile encompasses the regions containing the major domain and the helix bridging the minor domain. this region corresponds to the first  <dig> scrs. the long insertions/deletions  have been kept in the alignment in order to confer the hmm profile ability to adequately modeling the indels expected to occur in distantly related structures. we will refer to the hmm profile calculated from this alignment as plp_domain profile.

detection of sequences containing the type i plp-domains through databank searches
at the completion of the databank searches,  <dig> sequences were collected using the criteria and the filtering procedure reported in methods section; a detailed list is reported in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

phylogenic analysis of type i plp domains embedded in the nrps or pks multienzyme assemblies
the sequences corresponding to the type i plp domains were extracted from the parent sequences. a subset was selected using the routine “skipredundant” of the emboss suite  <cit>  to remove sequences sharing more than 70% identity to one of the other. thirty sequences were retained from the initial set of  <dig> type i domains and were multiply aligned. phylogenetic analyses were applied to visualize the relationships among domain families. the resulting consensus tree reported in figure  <dig> suggests that the type i domains can be divided into four distinct groups.

the most numerous group corresponds to the pfam aminotran_ <dig> family  , related to the plp at-ii family  <cit> . members of the family are the glutamate-1-semialdehyde  <dig> -aminomutase , the acetylornithine aminotransferase  and the  <dig> -dialkylglycine decarboxylase . a second group matches the pfam family aminotran_1_ <dig>  structurally related to the plp-dependent coa family  <cit>  to which serine palmitoyltransferase , 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate coa ligase  and 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase  belong. the third group coincides with the pfam family beta_elim_lyase  to which tyrosine phenol-lyase , member of the decarboxylase group i  <cit> , belongs. the last group, the least populated, is related to human cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase  and glutamic acid decarboxylase . the pfam name of this group is pyridoxal_dec .

the results of the annotation of the type i domain sequences through the b <dig> database  <cit>  show heterogeneity with respect to the pfam classification: the aminotran_ <dig> family indeed contains glutamate-1-semialdehyde  <dig> -aminomutase, taurine--pyruvate aminotransferase, diamine aminotransferase, diaminobutyrate-2-oxoglutarate transaminase, ornithine--oxo-acid aminotransferase . the pfam families aminotran_1_ <dig> and beta_elim_lyase appear homogeneous since they contain only 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase and tyrosine phenol lyase, respectively. the last and the less populated family pyridoxal_dec contains, as expected, decarboxylases namely diaminobutyrate decarboxylase and glutamate decarboxylase.

a phylogenetic tree for all the collected sequences was calculated . this tree conforms to the tree calculated for the type i sequence subset reported in figure  <dig> 

description of the domain architecture and sequence analysis of multidomain assemblies containing type i plp enzymes
the organization and the identity of the domains contained in the parent sequences from which the type i domains were extracted, was determined through the script “pfam_scan.pl” . these results and those deriving from the antismash  <cit>  analysis are summarized in table  <dig> for the non-redundant subset and in additional file 1: table s <dig> for the entire set, respectively. apparently, aminotran_ <dig> family represents the vast majority of the type i domains collected. they occur almost invariantly in mixed pks/nrps assemblies.

regarding the family denoted by the pfam tag aminotran_1_ <dig>  it can be noted that many assemblies do not contain more than three domains. however, they are very likely involved in pathways related to nrps or pks because the corresponding coding sequences are often adjacent to those characteristic of such biosynthetic clusters . for example, the coding sequence   from janthinobacterium lividum , is located between the sequences  and , corresponding to a putative peptidyl carrier protein and a putative l-prolyl-amp-ligase, respectively.

the beta_elim_lyase domains occur in predicted mixed pks/nrps transacting clusters. interestingly, the type i domains are incorporated in modules missing any a or at domain. this situation is reminiscent of the cluster involved in the biosynthesis of the mixed nrp/pk metabolite leinamycin from streptomyces atroolivaceus s- <dig>  <cit>  where the gene lnmj encodes six pks modules lacking the at domains and a domain homologous to tyrosine phenol-lyases . it was also experimentally proved that the missing activities were provided by a discrete at enzyme that loads the extender units in trans <cit> . moreover, we found a similar example in the mixed nrps/pks gene cluster  <dig> predicted by antismash  <cit>  analysis of the genome of the bacteria catenulispora acidiphila. in this cluster, to which belongs the sequence  shown in table  <dig>  the occurrence of a stand-alone a domain  is predicted.

pyridoxal_dec domains are the rarest since they occur only in two instances of our set, one of which could not be annotated by antismash  <cit> .

molecular modeling of the type i domains and docking of putative substrates
homology modeling and molecular docking have been applied to map the conserved residues onto the predicted structure of a representative domain of each family and to envisage their functional role. model-template pairs were chosen so as to maximize their percentage of sequence identity. the best aminotran_ <dig> pair was the plp type i domain from polyketide synthase from burkholderia thailandensis  and the structure of glutamate-1-semialdehyde  <dig> -aminomutase from thermus thermophilus  , sharing 40% sequence identity. the aminotran_1_ <dig> group was represented by the type i domain from the amp-binding enzyme from synechococcus sp.  modeled onto the template serine palmitoyltransferase from sphingobacterium metilovorum . sequence identity shared by the two sequences was 42%. beta_elim_lyase family was modeled using the domain from the keto-hydroxyglutarate-aldolase/polyketide synthase from lysobacter sp. . the template was the tyrosine phenol-lyase from erwinia herbicola , that shares about 24% sequence identity to the target sequence. pyridoxal_dec family was modeled using the type i target sequence from the nonribosomal peptide synthetase module from coxiella burnetii  and the template structure of human cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase . in this case, sequence identity reached 33%. alignments used for homology modelling in each subfamily are reported in figure  <dig> 

scrutiny of the pairwise and multiple sequence alignments within the four families along with the analysis of the corresponding models, pointed out the conservation of residues functionally important in the template enzymes. in particular, the aspartate residue interacting with the pyridine nitrogen atom of pyridoxal 5′ -phosphate is identically conserved in all the four families. the lysine forming the schiff base with the cofactor aldehydic group is also conserved, as expected, although it is replaced by the residue thr in the domains from methylobacterium extorquens  and , methyloversatilis universalis , and by val in the protein from sorangium cellulosum  . the aminotran_ <dig> group is characterized by a short insertion of approximately  <dig> residues  occurring at the template positions 288– <dig> . this insertion is portrayed as a loop on the surface of the model reported in figure 4a. likewise, the template region 364– <dig> corresponding to a short surface helix that contributes to the formation of the active site edge , is absent in the model domain. among the residues at the active site , tyr <dig>  makes stacking interaction with the plp ring and is conserved in many sequences of the same family. val <dig>  the other residue sandwiching the cofactor, is not conserved; in fact, it is replaced by the hydrophobic side chains ile, leu, ala, met and, in three cases, by thr . several residues involved in the binding of the cofactor phosphate group are also conserved, for example asn <dig>  glu <dig> and thr <dig> from the other subunit. the functionally characterized aminotransferase domain of the enzyme myca from bacillus subtilis involved in the synthesis of the cyclic lipopeptide mycosubtilin  <cit> , belongs to this family . the amine source for the myca enzyme was proved to be the amino acid gln. most of the residues occurring at the active site of the model of the representative domain  are identically conserved in the homologous sequences  suggesting that the substrate gln may be the amine donor utilized by many of the other domains of the same aminotran_ <dig> family. indeed, the docking of gln into the active of the model  shows favorable interactions with the evolutionarily conserved residues observed also in the gsa template. the α-amino group is stabilized by an ion-pair interaction with glu <dig>  thr <dig> of the other subunit is involved in a hydrogen bond to the carboxylate group of the substrate. arg <dig> binds the carboxylic group of the substrate and is identically conserved in the polyketide synthase from burkholderia thailandensis . this arg corresponds to a residue observed to be invariant in the gsa subfamily  <cit> ; it presumably required for binding the substrate carboxylate group through a salt bridge. finally, the δ-amino group of gln forms a hydrogen bond with the conserved ser <dig> residue. however, it should be noted that arg <dig> and ser <dig> residues occur in a non-conserved region of the type i domains where sequence alignment is intrinsically less accurate  and therefore the indications from the docking simulations are less reliable.

in the aminotran_1_ <dig> group, residues sandwiching the plp cofactor, namely his <dig> and ala <dig> , are invariant in all the homologous sequences considered . thr <dig> and ser <dig> from the other subunit interact with the cofactor phosphate group and are conserved. his <dig> in figure 5b is involved in the interaction with the o <dig> atom of plp and is identically conserved in the homologous sequences. regarding the binding of the substrate, it can be observed that his <dig> is involved in the binding of the substrate carboxylate  <cit> . the same role is predicted in the docked complex between substrate ser and the homology model . likewise, arg <dig> should also be mentioned among the residues involved in substrate binding in the serine palmitoyltransferase template. this residue is identically conserved and it is essential for the catalysis because it forms the key plp:l-serine quinonoid intermediate that condenses with palmitoyl-coa  <cit> . finally, according to the docked model of the plp:l-serine quinonoid intermediate, the β-hydroxyl moiety of the substrate participates to a hydrogen bond with ser <dig>  residue conserved in all the selected members of the aminotran_1_ <dig> family .

active site model of the type i domain representative of the beta_elim_lyase family shows that some residues relevant for catalysis in the representative member of the group tyrosine phenol-lyase  <cit>  are conserved. for example, phe <dig> and thr <dig>  the residues sandwiching the plp cofactor, are conserved  although the latter residue is replaced by ser in one case. the residues arg <dig>  arg <dig> and asn <dig>  deemed to be involved in interaction with the carboxylic group of the reaction intermediate in tyrosine phenol-lyase, are conserved . on the contrary, residues that in the postulated mechanism of β-elimination reaction carry out the protonation of the substrate cγ, are not present in the beta_elim_lyase of type i embedded in multidomain context. in particular, tyr <dig> of tyrosine phenol-lyase is replaced by an arg residue in the model domain, while arg <dig> that assists tyr <dig> during the protonation is deleted in all the sequences reported in additional file 1: figure s2c, including the plp domain involved in the biosynthesis of leinamycin .

the pyridoxal_dec group is the least populated; assessment of evolutionary conservation of residues possibly involved in catalysis is more difficult. his <dig> and ala <dig> that, as in the aminotran_1_ <dig> family sandwich the plp ring, are conserved. his <dig> and ser <dig>  ligands of the cofactor phosphate group, are also conserved. according to the docked model , the α-carboxylate group of the substrate is stabilized by an ion-pair interaction with arg <dig>  this residue is equivalent to arg <dig> in glutamic acid decarboxylase, enzyme of the same family, that is responsible for the formation of a salt bridge to its substrate γ-aminobutyric acid  <cit> . similarly tyr <dig>  the catalytic residue of the group ii decarboxylases that performs the protonation of the cα atom of the quinonoid intermediate  <cit> , is conserved.

prediction of protein-protein interaction sites on the homology models of the type i domains
prediction of the presence of potential protein-protein binding sites was carried out for the models and the relative template structures in their dimeric forms. the results suggest that some type i domains covalently incorporated in multidomain contexts possess potential protein binding sites missing in the equivalent regions of their respective structural templates. these regions are in proximity of the active sites and contain residues largely conserved in the corresponding homologs. in particular, the aminotran_ <dig> domain displays a small potential region encompassing the high interaction-probability residues phe <dig>  ile <dig>  lys <dig>  met <dig>  asp <dig> and gly <dig> . the first four residues are located in the poorly conserved n-terminal region . along with the other potentially interacting sites, they form a region around the active site mouth. the aminotran_1_ <dig> domain shows a surface region predicted as potential protein-protein interaction site that includes asp <dig> and the sequence ala353-lys <dig> . this region is located on the rim of the active site. however, the potentially interacting surface of the model is, in this case, similar to that observed in the structural template . the putative interaction between the cp and the type i domains of polyketide synthase from burkholderia thailandensis  have been predicted by protein-protein docking simulation using the cluspro server  <cit> . the homology model of the cp domain encompassed by the positions 932– <dig> of  has been calculated using the templates denoted by , ,  and . although the results deriving from the docking experiments carried out with homology models should be considered with the great caution, it is interesting to note that the ten best complexes calculated by the cluspro analysis suggest that the cp domain may interact with the surface regions of the plp domain predicted as potential protein-protein interaction sites . the beta_elim_lyase model possesses a wide surface predicted as a potential interaction site, significantly larger than that predicted in the corresponding structural template . the interacting surface clusters into two patches located in the proximity of the active site. the first cluster is centered on the residues arg <dig>  his <dig>  gly <dig>  gly <dig>  pro <dig> and tyr <dig>  the second cluster incorporates the residues leu <dig>  phe <dig>  pro <dig>  ile <dig> and tyr <dig>  the pyridoxal_dec family, represented by the model of type i domain in the nonribosomal peptide synthetase module from coxiella burnetii , displays a surface interaction propensity similar to the reference template structure of human cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase  . however, according to multiple sequence alignments between members of this type i domain and the other known members of the group ii decarboxylases family, the characteristic third n-terminal domain  formed by three α-helices that fold upon dimerization  <cit> , is lost in pyridoxal_dec family upon incorporation in a multidomain context. it is therefore tempting to speculate that this structural deletion, which would result in an alternate entry into the active site, has evolved to accommodate the adjacent domains of the nrps framework, e.g., a phosphopantetheine binding domain, and that α-decarboxylation could occur on the amino acid substrate tethered to the phosphopantetheine arm.

discussion
in this work we focused specifically on the type i plp domains involved in putative bacterial nrps and/or pks assemblies as tailoring domains operating in cis. we collected a set of predicted type i plp sequences incorporated in multidomain environments from eubacterial sources using the hmm search using the plp_domain profile. only those sequences containing a phosphopantetheine binding domain  were considered. in most cases, the type i domains are placed downstream from a cp domain . as a test, the selection of sequences was carried out using as a criterion the association of the type i domains with adenylation, condensation or acyltransferase domains. in all cases, only subsets of the group of sequences retrieved with the original requirement were recovered, showing the correctness of the adopted procedure. the only exception to this “rule” was the β-ketoacyl synthase from streptomyces violaceusniger . this  <dig> residue long sequence is atypical since it does not possess a recognizable phosphopantetheine binding domain and displays a segment, containing about  <dig> residues, in the central sequence region apparently lacking any relation to known pfam domains. in a few cases  or , pfam annotation does not report the presence of a cp domain. however, we were able to detect those domains using the “pfam_scan.pl” annotation script. in some cases, use of a locally installed program provides an effective way of finely tuning the parameters.

the assemblies containing the type i domains we collected, were found only in the following eubacterial phyla: acidobacteria, actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, chloroflexi, cyanobacteria, firmicutes, planctomycetes, proteobacteria, and verrucomicrobia. however, it should be considered that the observed distribution may be significantly biased by uneven species sampling.

sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses indicated that four groups can be distinguished within the collected set of the type i domains. the four groups share the identical conservation  of the key residues asp and lys which are involved in interaction with the cofactor pyridine nitrogen and in the formation of a schiff base with the aldehyde group of plp, respectively.

we further studied the structural features characterizing these type i protein subfamilies by multiple sequence alignment, homology modeling and search of the potential binding sites possibly involved in the interaction with protein partners.

the most numerous group is the aminotran_ <dig> family which is structurally related to the glutamate 1-semialdehyde- <dig> -aminomutase  <cit> . the proteins belonging to this group are predicted to occur mainly in mixed nrps/pks machineries. the aminotransferase domain embedded in the multidomain pks/nrps enzyme myca from bacillus subtilis involved in the synthesis of the cyclic lipopeptide mycosubtilin  <cit> , is the example of the functionally characterized member of the group. the role of the aminotransferase domain is the insertion of the amino group into the polyketide biosynthetic intermediate; the amine source for the myca enzyme was demonstrated to be glutamine  <cit> . a similar function was proposed also for the aminotransferase domains encoded by the genes mxcl and zea <dig> <cit>  from myxochelin and zeamine biosynthetic clusters respectively, which belong to the same subfamily.

the multiple sequence alignment between a non-redundant set of sequences and the reference modeling template evidenced the structural features characteristic of these domains. as shown in figure 3a, there is an insertion of about 12– <dig> residues at position 288– <dig>  that corresponds to the region 283– <dig> in additional file 1: figure s2a. the insertion is located on the surface of the domain  and may be involved in modulating the interaction with the adjacent domains and/or in substrate recognition. indeed, docking simulations suggests that a loop is involved in interaction with the cp domain . in the surface area between the sequence positions 364– <dig> of the alignment in figure 3a , a deletion region is present. further, the prediction of potential sites of protein-protein interaction assigns a significant potential to a region in the active site proximity, not visible in the equivalent position of the structural template . these observations, in particular the presence of a wide region of potential protein-protein interaction , suggest that this structural feature could be required for productive interaction with the adjacent domains in a multidomain context.

the aminotran_1_ <dig> group is structurally related to the coenzyme a  family of the plp-dependent enzymes of type i  <cit> . they are predicted to be involved mainly in pks pathways. within the coa subfamily, serine palmitoyltransferase is the most closely related enzyme. sequence alignments and homology modeling indicate the conservation of the residues involved in substrate-coa interaction and the absence of long insertion/deletions with respect to the structural template . exception is the sequence of the type i domain from the anabaena circinalis protein  that shows two insertions, one of which 10-residue long . the only experimentally characterized member of this family is the pigh protein  from serratia marcescens <cit> , involved in the biosynthesis of the three-pyrrolic red pigment prodigiosin. pigh contains two cp domains followed by a type i plp domain, sert , predicted to catalyze the decarboxylation of l-serine and the formation of c <dig> fragment used in the formation of the pyrrole b ring of prodigiosin. analysis of surface of the homology model of the representative type i domain of this family suggests the presence of an increased potential for protein interaction in the proximity of the active site mouth . however, the increase of the interaction potential with respect to the stand-alone counterpart is less evident than in the case of the aminotran- <dig> family.

extensive remodeling of the protein surface can be conjectured also for the beta_elim_lyase family. in fact, as in aminotran_ <dig> group a wide region of potential protein-protein interaction  is observed. the sequence divergence from the model is evident at the n-terminal part of the domain. this family is indeed characterized by domains occurring mainly at the c-terminal edge of the multidomain module. despite the conservation of many active site key residues observed in the tyrosine phenol-lyase enzyme, some side chains involved in the catalytic mechanisms are missing. in particular, as mentioned in the results section, tyr <dig> of tyrosine phenol-lyase is replaced by an arg residue while arg <dig> is missing. although the relevance of such variations on the functionality of these domains cannot be presently assessed, it is worth mentioning that studies on classical β-eliminating lyases showed how the mutation of the residues corresponding to arg <dig> and tyr <dig> affected the activity of two proteins belonging to this family. the substitution of arg <dig> with ile and val in tyrosine phenol-lyase caused a significant impairment in the activity towards tyr, but not in case of other substrates; moreover the same substitutions were present in the wild type and fully active tryptophan indole-lyase enzymes  <cit> . similarly, the replacement of tyr <dig>  had different effects on the activity of the protein towards different substrates  <cit> . these findings indicate that tyr <dig> and arg <dig> are not absolutely indispensable for the catalytic activity of all the plp enzymes of this family. regarding the prediction of protein interaction sites on the type i domains, the results suggest the presence of a wide area possibly involved in the interaction with other protein partners as observed in other aforementioned families.

the pyridoxal_dec family, the least numerous, is related to the decarboxylase family ii  <cit>  to which the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase belongs. however, the most similar reference structure found was cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase, an enzyme involved in hypotaurine biosynthesis  <cit>  which functions as an autoantigen in human endocrine autoimmune diseases  <cit> . conservation of the residues essential for catalysis in glutamate decarboxylase, which is better characterized than cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase, suggests the possible preservation of the decarboxylase activity in this domain. the databank search showed that the pathogenic proteobacterium coxiella burnetii, whose genome has been completely sequenced, possesses one of the two pyridoxal_dec domains found during our databank searches. the other, showing high similarity with glutamate decarboxylase domains, was found in the cyanobacterium lyngbya majuscula, in particular in the biosynthetic cluster of jamaicamide. interestingly, it is embedded within the adenylation domain of the pks/nrps multidomain subunit jaml, but the precise function of the plp-dependent domain in the biosynthesis of this metabolite has not been so far clarified  <cit> .

the results of our work show that the domains belonging to the type i plp dependent enzymes linked to a component of the multidomain frameworks related to nrps and/or pks-like assemblies are relatively rare but widespread among several bacterial phyla. these domains display conservation  of residues involved in cofactor binding and catalysis. however the prediction of protein-protein interaction sites suggests that the n- and c-terminal ends of the domain polypeptide chain display stronger sequence divergence with respect to the reference stand-alone structures . these regions are necessarily involved in connecting the linkers bridging the other domains in the multidomain subunits . on the other hand, it must stressed that predictions of interacting sites are still very inaccurate and in this case they can be significantly biased by modeling inaccuracies especially related to the prediction of side chain solvent accessibility. nevertheless, the differences between the prediction in the surface regions possibly involved in protein-protein interaction of the model and the templates are, at least in the case of aminotran_ <dig> and aminotran_1_ <dig> groups, very strong. these two families display the highest sequence similarity between the model and the template. therefore, the strong differences observed can represent significant signals, while differences observed in the models of other families are less reliable. this hypothesis is supported by the results of the docking experiment carried out using the homology model of the plp type i and cp domains of the aminotran_ <dig> family. indeed, although the results of docking experiments carried out with homology models should be taken with the great caution, the ten best complexes indicate that the cp domain may interact with the surface regions of the plp domain predicted as potential protein-protein interaction sites .

in this context the quaternary architecture of multidomain assemblies incorporating a plp-dependent type i domain should also be considered. indeed, the plp type i domains are dimers or tetramers because the proper formation of their catalytically competent active site requires the participation of residues from the adjacent subunits  <cit> . this structural constraint fits well with the dimeric architecture of pks systems. on the other hand, studies with individual nrps domains showed that they were monomers  <cit> ; however a dimeric structure was demonstrated in the multidomain synthetase vibf and a continuum of monomeric and dimeric oligomerization states in nrps was proposed  <cit> . the existence of a number of secondary metabolites of mixed pks/nrps origin shows that the two biosynthetic machineries are compatible and studies on multienzyme docking in hybrid megasynthetases indicated that nrps subunits in mixed systems self-associate to interact with partner pks homodimers  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this work offers a systematic view of the occurrence of the type i plp-dependent enzymes within nrps and pks assembly lines and predicts their structural characteristics using in silico methods. the results of this research contribute to a deeper understanding of the functional and structural diversity of the plp-enzyme family of fold type i and pave the way to further studies aimed at their applications in combinatorial biosynthesis. in fact, the success in the functioning of engineered biosynthetic clusters depends, to a great extent, on efficient molecular recognition between the single components.
