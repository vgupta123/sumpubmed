BACKGROUND
mastitis is a common condition during lactation and its incidence oscillates between  <dig> and 33% of the lactating mothers  <cit> . the number of non-infectious mastitis that become an infectious disease is usually so high that some authors define the term "mastitis" as an infectious process of the mammary gland characterized by a variety of local and systemic symptoms  <cit> . however, the number of studies dealing with the microbiological aspects of human mastitis is low and the role of specific agents has yet to be described. in fact, published articles on the bacteria causing this condition are scarce and most are, at least,  <dig> years old  <cit> .

traditionally, staphylococcus aureus has been considered the most common etiological agent although, unfortunately, the cases in which microbiological analyses are performed are exceptional. however, treatments with antibiotic or antifungal drugs are usually prescribed without knowing the etiology or the antibiotic susceptibility of the microorganism involved. this practice may lead to a worsening of the symptoms since strains that cause mastitis may exhibit multirresistance to drugs and/or form biofilms. therefore, a better knowledge of the main features of the bacterial species involved in the mastitic process would represent a great advance for the design of new strategies for the prevention and/or treatment of this condition.

in a previous work, we investigated the microbial diversity of breast milk in  <dig> women with lactational mastitis by culture-dependent and -independent techniques  <cit> , and observed that staphylococci, mainly staphylococcus epidermidis, seem to be the major microorganisms present in breast milk of women with infectious mastitis. in recent years s. epidermidis has become increasingly recognized as opportunistic pathogen  <cit> . parallel, several genetic determinants involved in mechanisms of adhesion and biofilm formation have been described in this species  <cit>  while its rate of resistance to several antibiotics has increased during the last years  <cit> .

in this context, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the presence of s. epidermidis in breast milk of women with infectious mastitis, to characterize the isolates and to compare their properties with those of strains isolated from milk of healthy women.

RESULTS
bacterial counts and identification of staphylococci in milk
presence of staphylococci was observed in  <dig> of the  <dig> samples provided by women with lactational mastitis. in these samples, counts in baird parker  agar plates ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  log <dig> cfu ml- <dig> . a total of  <dig> isolates were obtained from the bp plates  and all of them were lysozyme-resistant, lysostaphin-sensitive, catalase-positive, gram-positive cocci. among these presumptive staphylococcal isolates,  <dig> were identified as s. epidermidis on the basis of biochemical tests and species-specific pcr assays. this species was present in  <dig> milk samples. only  <dig> staphylococcal isolates belonged to the species s. aureus and they were obtained from milk of eight women. pcr sequencing of a 16s rdna fragment confirmed the results. the remaining  <dig> isolates that gave no amplification with the multiplex pcr were further identified by 16s rdna pcr sequencing as staphylococcus pasteuri , staphylococcus warneri  and staphylococcus hominis  . the partial 16s rdna sequences obtained from single isolates belonging to the species staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were deposited in the embl nucleotide sequence database under accession numbers  and , respectively. then, our attention was focused on the s. epidermidis isolates.

genotyping of the s. epidermidis isolates by pfge profiling
the  <dig> isolates of s. epidermidis recovered in this study were subjected to pfge genotyping together with  <dig> isolates previously obtained from breast milk of  <dig> healthy women . the analysis of the fingerprints obtained revealed the existence of  <dig> different pulsotypes among the isolates from women with mastitis and  <dig> among healthy women. comparison of these genotypes showed that most of the strains grouped together depending on their origin in two different clusters, one containing most of the strains obtained from mastitic milk while the second contained most of the strains isolated from milk of healthy women .

detection of virulence determinants among the s. epidermidis strains
the  <dig> different s. epidermidis strains  were selected to study the presence of potential virulence traits. hemolytic activity could not be detected or was very weak among all the assayed strains. in relation to adhesion-related genes, the multiplex pcr assay revealed the presence of the genes embp and atle in all the strains. the fbe gene was detected in 65% of the strains from mastitis and in 75% of those isolated from healthy women . in contrast, the icad gene was more prevalent among strains from mastitis cases  than in those from healthy women   . a good correlation was observed between the presence of biofilm-related ica operon and the results obtained using the cra assay, which determines potential for slime production, and all the strains that amplified for the gene gave also positive results by the phenotypic assay.

determination of mic's to several antibiotics
determination of mic's to  <dig> antibiotics or antibiotics mixtures in the  <dig> s. epidermidis strains revealed that all of them were susceptible to the lower concentration of nitrofurantoin  and rifampin  while the results against the rest of antibiotics were variable depending on the strains . independently of their origin, most of the strains were sensitive to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole , gentamicyn , linezolid , fosfomicyn , ciprofloxacin , tetracycline , chloramphenicol , penicillin , ampicillin  and the glycopeptides vancomycin  and teicoplanin . the percentage of susceptible strains was lower for imipenem  and quinupristin/dalfopriscin . however, significant differences were observed in the percentage of strains resistant to some antibiotics depending on their origin . for instance, 43% of isolates from mastitic samples showed a mic of mupirocin ≥  <dig> μg ml- <dig> while only 22% of those isolated from non-mastitic samples reached this value . similarly, 60% of the mastitic-related strains showed a mic >  <dig> μg ml- <dig> against erythromycin in contrast to 33% of the other group . in the case of clindamycin, 28% of the strains from mastitic milk presented a mic >  <dig> μg ml- <dig> while the percentage was of 8% in strains from healthy women . a higher percentage of oxacillin resistance  was also found among the strains from mastitis  than those from healthy mothers  . finally, two strains from women with mastitis  were resistant to streptomycin  and one strain  from the same group was resistant to vancomycin . no strains resistant to these two antibiotics were found among the strains from healthy women.

presence of meca and sccmec typing
among the  <dig> strains showing oxacillin resistance, the meca gene could be detected by pcr in  <dig> . no amplification was observed in two strains of each group , which had shown an oxacillin mic value of >  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  in contrast, the meca gene was detected in five oxacillin susceptible strains, one from a mastitis case  and four from healthy women .

the type of sccmec was determined in all the meca+ strains. the ccrb gene could be amplified from  <dig> of the  <dig> meca+ strains from the mastitis group and, on the basis of the ccrb restriction pattern with hinfi  or with hinfi/bsmi ,  <dig> strains were assigned to type iv and the remaining three  to type iii . amplification of ccrb was achieved in the  <dig> meca+ strains from healthy women and, among them,  <dig> strains showed type iv and two type iii sccmec. the application of the full assay described by zhang et al.  <cit>  confirmed these results. the  <dig> meca+ strains that could not be typed on the basis of their ccrb restriction pattern remained non typeable with the full zhang et al. assay.

discussion
s. epidermidis is a normal inhabitant of the skin and mucosal surfaces in healthy hosts and its ubiquitous prevalence as a commensal species makes difficult for a clinician to decide if an isolate represents the etiological agent or a culture contamination  <cit> . therefore, isolation of this bacterial species is generally regarded as non-related to a mastitis case, even when it is the only species present in a milk sample  <cit> .

s. epidermidis was the dominant or unique staphylococcal species in breast milk of women suffering mastitis, a finding described previously  <cit> , which indicates that this bacterial species could be an etiological agent of human lactational mastitis. similarly, several studies have shown the implication of this bacterial species as an agent of mastitis in different animal species  <cit> .

the genotyping of the s. epidermidis isolates by pfge revealed a low diversity within this species in the breast milk of women with mastitis, with a mean of  <dig> different profiles per sample. a lost in the microbial diversity present in milk of women with mastitis has been previously pointed  <cit> . comparison by pfge dendogram analysis of these strains with those obtained from breast milk of healthy women showed the existence of two main clusters and, within these two groups, the strains generally matched with the origin . however, a few strains from healthy women grouped together with the mastitis cluster reflecting a similar genetic background. the fact that their presence in milk of healthy women does not constitute a health problem could indicate that a predisposal host is also need for s. epidermidis to develop an infection  <cit> .

among the s. epidermidis strains analyzed, the presence of adhesion-related genes was high independently of the condition of the women from which they were isolated. the presence of genes encoding cell surface proteins may explain, at least partially, the high prevalence of s. epidermidis in breast milk, mammary areola and ducts of both healthy and mastitis-suffering women. in contrast, the percentage of strains carrying the biofilm-related ica operon was higher in strains from mastitis milk than in that obtained from healthy women. a potential relationship between s. epidermidis infection and the presence of such operon has been reported  <cit> . in fact, biofilm formation has been described in many cases of staphylococcal mastitis and this is the reason why such property is considered as a potential virulence factor  <cit> .

strains belonging to either the mastitis or the healthy women group showed a similar susceptibility against many of the antibiotics tested; however, a higher percentage of mupirocin-, erythromycin-, clindamicyn- and oxacillin-resistant strains was found among those isolated from mastitic milk. resistance to these and other antibiotics in pathogenic s. epidermidis isolates has been reported previously  <cit> . the resistance of these strains could be partly due to the increasing use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which encourage selection of multirresistant strains  <cit> . improper antibiotherapy may explain why staphylococcal mastitis frequently becomes a chronic and/or recurrent infection. in this study, the presence of meca gene accompanied with resistance to oxacillin  was observed in 62% of the strains from mastitis, but only in 33% from the healthy group. the meca gene was not detected in four oxacillin-resistant strains. these strains may represent cases of borderline resistance which is characterized by an oxacillin mic at or just above the susceptibly breakpoint . in contrast, the meca gene was detected in five oxacillin-susceptible strains, a fact that has been previously described  <cit>  and that may be due to gene deletions.

methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  are being reported with increasing frequency in the community and they have been called community-acquired -mrsa, which are associated with skin and soft tissue infection  <cit>  but are also frequently isolated from healthy hosts  <cit> . most of the meca+ strains used in this study could be ascribed to type iv sccmec. in s. epidermidis, some studies have reported that sccmec type iv is generally carried by ca-mrs  <cit>  but this type seems to be predominant among clinically relevant s. epidermidis isolates  <cit> . the fact that the ccrb gene was not amplified from four meca+ strains may be due to the presence of different alleles for this gene  <cit> .

in the last years, a renewed medical and research interest has been focused on s. epidermidis since it has become the most important cause of nosocomial infections  <cit> . the complete genome analysis of some methicillin-resistant s. aureus and s. epidermidis strains of human origin have revealed the propensity of s. aureus to cause fulminant and sometimes life-threatening infections, as opposed to the predisposition of s. epidermidis for chronic and recurrent infections  <cit> . identification of s. epidermidis as etiological agents of infection is sometimes hindered by the fact that infections associated with this microorganims are characterized by subtle, non-specific clinical manifestations  <cit> . precisely, these characteristics occur in most cases of lactational mastitis. genome flexibility in s. epidermidis may contribute to the acquisition of some transferable virulence and resistant traits  <cit>  and to the evolution of this species from a commensal to a pathogenic microorganism in susceptible hosts  <cit> . in fact, it seems that there is an important host factor in lactational mastitis since a woman having such condition usually displays the same clinical signs after subsequent pregnancies. additionally, it would explain why only a 3–30% of lactating women suffer from such infection when it is the predominant bacterial species found in breast milk of healthy women  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
staphylococcus epidermidis is the most prevalent staphylococcal species isolated from breast milk of women suffering mastitis, where it is present at a concentration notably higher than that present in milk of healthy woman . the percentage of strains showing biofilm production ability and resitance to mupirocin, erythromycin, clindamicyn and/or methicillin was significantly higher among those obtained from women with lactational mastitis than among those isolated from healthy women.

the random method used to select staphylococcal colonies from the samples could introduce a bias regarding the low number of samples from which s. aureus was isolated. traditionally, s. aureus has been considered as the main etiological agent of mastitis. however, the results of this work suggest that s. epidermidis could be an additional and underrated cause of lactational mastitis; as a consequence, its presence should be also considered in bacteriological analyses of human milk when there is a suspicious of a mastitis infection. further studies involving a larger number of samples and staphylococcal isolates will be required to confirm the results obtained in this study.
