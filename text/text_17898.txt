BACKGROUND
comparison of different protein x-ray structures has previously been made in a number of different ways; for example, by visual examination, by differences in the locations of secondary structures, by explicit superposition of structural elements, e.g. α-carbon atom locations, or by procedures that utilize a common symmetry element or geometrical feature of the structures to be compared. this latter procedure has been utilized in connection with the identification of the structurally conserved residues within the core of the immunoglobulin variable domains  <cit> . a singular advantage of such procedure, compared with the other procedures, is that it provides additional information that relates the location of the residues to attributes of the geometrical feature to which these locations have been aligned or referenced. for example, it has been pointed out that the alignment, based on the pseudo 2-fold symmetry axis of the variable domains of known immunoglobulin structures, provides information about the possible structural or functional roles of residues   <cit> .

the overall shape or distribution of the amino acid residues of a protein domain may also be considered a geometric invariant of a set of structures undergoing comparison when the differences in their global geometries are small and involve only a minor fraction of the residues comprising the domains. the representation of such shape may be given by the distribution of atomic, cα, or residue centroid locations in three-dimensional space. such representation, generating an ellipsoidal characterization of the shape of a domain, had previously provided useful information in connection with drug discovery  <cit>  and with the spatial distribution of residue hydrophobicity within protein domains  <cit> . this characterization of domain shape provides two spatial metrics, one of which references the location of a residue to the ellipsoidal principal axes of the domain and the other which yields information detailing the proximity of a residue to either the interior or exterior of the protein domain. the present paper describes how the changes in antibody structure that occur upon binding to an antigenic target are characterized by the consequent changes of these two metrics

one limitation of the present procedure is that the unliganded antibody structure  is required as well as its antibody structure  in the complex. while the protein data bank   <cit>  has numerous antibodies complexed with their viral or chemical targets, there are many fewer unliganded structures listed. the number of pdb structures satisfying our requirements is further reduced since interest will be focused on antibody binding to an influenza viral hemagglutinin antigenic target. furthermore, we require 100% sequence identity between the unliganded and complexed heavy and light chain domains of the fab . two pdb antibody structures that satisfy these requirements are antibody hc <dig> complexed with a truncated hemagglutinin structure  <cit> , pdb id 2vir, and its unliganded antibody structure  <cit> , pdb id 1gig; and fab 17/ <dig> complexed with a peptide hemagglutinin mimetic  <cit> , pdb id 1ifh, and its unliganded antibody structure  <cit> , pdb id 1hil. interest will focus on the two distance metrics of the ellipsoidal characterization of protein domain structure and on the complementary information they present that describes the structural changes that occur upon the antigenic binding of these two antibodies. hopefully, such information involving a different perspective from that provided previously may assist in the attempts to design synthetic vaccines on the basis of x-ray structures of anti-body-peptide complexes  <cit> .

methods
the ellipsoidal characterization of a protein domain has been previously described  <cit> , however, it will be useful to indulge in a degree of redundancy to smoothly illustrate the appropriate extension required for the present application. the present calculations are based upon the residue side-chain centroids of the protein. however, as mentioned previously the distribution of points in three-dimensional space chosen to represent a protein structure may well be that of the cα coordinates, of the atomic coordinates, or of any other set of points in space chosen to detail protein structure.

the residue centroids are calculated with inclusion of only the heavy atoms of the side-chain and without the backbone atoms. one could have included the backbone atoms as well in calculating the residue centroids which would yield minor modifications of the present results. not including the backbone atoms places the residue centroids at a greater distance from the backbone and provides somewhat greater emphasis with regard to differences in side chain location and orientation.

to calculate the displacements of the residues in the liganded compared with the unliganded structure, the calculations are performed twice; once inclusive of all residues of the unliganded domain which we will designate by "a" and once inclusive of all residues of the domain in the complex which we will designate by "b".

the magnitude of the displacement of the ith residue centroid of the complexed domain with respect to its location in the unliganded domain, di, is given by the distance between the coordinates of the centroids with respect to the two different sets of principal axes.

 di = 1/ <dig>  

the subscript, with either an "a" or "b", designates whether the coordinate is referenced to the principal axes of the unliganded or of the liganded domain, respectively.

the difference or the change in the ellipsoidal distance of the ith residue, ei, is given by:

when the difference between the antibody structures of the liganded and unliganded domains is minimal this procedure will provide a relatively accurate characterization of the displacements and changes in the ellipsoidal distances that occur. however, if the liganded and unliganded structures differ sufficiently, the calculated differences may then be anomalous. for example residues far from the binding site should exhibit minimal displacements upon complexing. if this is not observed then the liganded and unliganded structures would be sufficiently different and not provide principal axes that are comparable and consequently appropriate to be used for structural comparison. if, however, only a minor region or part of the liganded and unliganded structures differs, e.g., perhaps only differing in the vicinity of the binding site, such difficulty may be circumvented by the choice of comparable substructures to reference the displacements and the changes in ellipsoidal distances. the substructures chosen, for example, may involve the elimination of residues that exhibit significant displacements between the liganded and unliganded structures. in pursuit of such strategy, after diagonalization of the tensor, all residue locations of the substructures will be provided; however, locations of the residues that have been eliminated in the choice of the substructures would then have to be calculated by translating the location of these residues to the centers-of-geometry of each of the substructures and then by rotating into the orientation of the principal axes of the substructures. this procedure will be demonstrated in the comparison between the residue locations of the 1ifh and 1hil pdb viral structures.

finally, it should be noted that this strategy of referencing structures undergoing comparison to the sets of principal axes of relatively invariant substructures represents a more general and inclusive strategy than referencing the structures to sets of symmetry axes, e.g., alignments based on the pseudo 2-fold symmetry axes of the variable domains of known immunoglobulin structures. in the present case the invariance of the axes is a consequence of the invariance of the substructures and need not be related to any explicit structural symmetry.

RESULTS
calculations have been performed utilizing the x-ray structure of a free hc <dig> fab  and the structure of the hc <dig> fab in complex with the membrane distal domain of x <dig> hemagglutinin  . figures 1a and 1c show the displacements and differences in ellipsoidal distances in angstroms of the amino acid centroids of the n-terminal fab heavy chain domain of the complex, from their locations in the free or unliganded antibody domain. first, one notes, that aside from the regions of amino acids that are bracketed by the dashed lines or specifically labeled, the displacements and differences are small, mainly less than  <dig> angstrom, confirming that a major portion of the overall antibody structure, before and after binding is comparable. the bracketed region spans residues phe <dig> to tyr <dig>  this region, the region undergoing the most extensive structural modification of the antibody upon binding to the truncated "ha top" involves the tip of the h <dig> cdr . it is highlighted in white in figure  <dig>  figures 1b and 1d, which are expanded views of the bracketed regions, accentuate the complementarity of the information provided by the two different distance metrics. note that the amino acid with the greatest displacement, tyr <dig> in figure 1b, shows a difference in ellipsoidal distance in figure 1d that is approximately equal to zero; whereas phe <dig>  which has a displacement less than tyr <dig> exhibits the largest value of differential ellipsoidal distance. figure  <dig> illustrates the reason for this difference. comparison of figure 3a with figure 3b shows that the structural modification of the h <dig> loop upon binding involves the swapping of the location of tyr <dig>  behind the loop shown in the unliganded structure of figure 3a, to a location in front of the loop in the liganded complex shown in figure 3b. while this involves a relatively large displacement from its position in the unliganded structure, its distance from the interior of the heavy chain domain  is relatively unchanged. this contrasts with the rotation of the phe <dig> six-membered ring which clearly places its residue centroid upon complexation at a greater distance from the interior of the heavy chain domain.

furthermore, while figure 1a shows the asn <dig> residue of the h <dig> cdr loop of the n-terminal domain of the heavy chain to exhibit only a slightly greater displacement than the displacements of its adjacent residues, figure 1c shows its comparative displacement towards the interior of the n-terminal domain of the heavy chain to be enhanced compared with those of its neighbors. this is apparently mediated by the interaction in the complex between asn <dig> and its proximate neighbor ser <dig> of the "ha-top" as shown in figure  <dig> 

moments of the 1gig and 2vir structures obtained by the diagonalization of equation  <dig> differ by a few percent and the two sets of principal coordinates yield coordinate frames with axes alignments that differ by at most several degrees.

certain enhanced displacements apparently identify residues that have been spatially shifted due to crystal packing. figure 1a shows an enhanced displacement, with respect to the local background, of the residue gln <dig> of the heavy chain n-terminal domain. such displacement, clearly unrelated to antibody binding, appears to arise from crystal packing. residues significantly displaced, while not in the vicinity of the region of binding and also observed to be considerably solvent exposed in the free state of the antibody can be so identified.

a few words should be devoted to the relationship between the intent of the previous x-ray studies and the objectives of the present study. the later x-ray study  <cit>  had focused on the effect of two mutant antigens in inducing structural distortions of the bound complex that could be responsible for the evasion of antibody neutralization. an earlier rigid-body docking study  <cit>  had examined the effect of a number of mutations upon hc <dig> antibody binding. the present study does not address this issue and has focused solely upon the 2vir structure; namely, the complex involving the wild type antigenic hemagglutinin "top". the earlier study  <cit>  involved an extensive examination of the structural differences that occur due to antibody binding. differences in the binding to three different antigenic mimetics of ha <dig> were examined. it was emphasized that the information obtained was encouraging for attempts to design synthetic vaccines on the basis of x-ray structures of anti-body-peptide complexes  <cit> . it was also stated that only by comparing the free, unliganded structure with its complexed form is it possible to asses the extent and contribution of conformational changes to the antigen recognition process; a statement supportive of the strategy of the present work. furthermore, it was stated that, although many fab structures have been determined as complexes, only a few have also been described in their uncomplexed state; a situation which is paralleled to this date since there are, presently, many fewer uncomplexed immunoglobulin structures than complexed structures. finally, extreme differences in the extent of the conformational adaptations in antibodies as a consequence of antigenic binding had been noted  <cit> , and, a large conformational change observed in the h <dig> loop between the free and bound form  <cit>  was found. this large conformational change of the h <dig> cdr loop of the 1ifh structure contrasts significantly with the corresponding change of the h <dig> cdr loop of the 2vir structure. this difference is illustrated in figure  <dig> by a ce  superposition  <cit>  of the h <dig> antibody loops of the 2vir and 1ifh pdb complexed structures, upon their respective h <dig> loops of the1gig and 1hil pdb uncomplexed structures. a similar superposition had been previously performed for the cdr loops of the anti hiv fab  <dig>   <cit> . the relatively greater distortion of the h <dig> loop of 1ifh structure compared with that of 2vir is consistent with the idea that shape complementarity ...for the smaller, flexible peptides can more easily achieve closer contact with the paratope surface  <cit> . such relatively large structural change of the n-terminal heavy chain domain of the1ifh structure upon binding will be shown to require modification of the present procedure to properly represent the observed structural changes. this provides an example of how the substructures of a set of structures may be selected to obtain sets of relatively invariant principal axes to be used for structural comparison.

such difference in the orientation of the two sets of principal axes can be significantly reduced by determining the axes for substructures from which significantly displaced distant residues from the center of the domain have been eliminated. while there is a degree of freedom in the choice of such elimination and one may be motivated to optimize the correspondence between the two sets of principal axes used for comparison, the substructures presently chosen will simply involve the elimination of only the two residues asp <dig> and asn100a from the h <dig> cdr loops, namely, the residues that exhibit the greatest displacements shown in figures 7a and 7b. with the principal axes obtained for both reduced liganded and unliganded substructures one would then rotate the original sets of residue centroids eliminated in the determination of the substructure, into the substructure principal axis orientations after translations to the substructure centers-of-geometry.

changes in the magnitudes of the ellipsoidal distances contrast with what had been found for the displacements. comparison of the figures 9c and 7c surprisingly shows comparable ranges of the values of these changes. this is also seen in the expanded scales of figures 9d and 7d which detail the region of interaction and consequently of the region of greatest change. so, one might conclude that the ellipsoidal distances are relatively insensitive to rotations of the principal axes. this is apparently a consequence of the proportionality of the ellipsoidal distances to the radial fractional distances from the center of the domain to the ellipsoidal surface or exterior. such proportionalities are relatively unchanged as the principal axes are slightly rotated with respect to each other. this would be especially true for a domain approximately spherical in shape.

complementary information is again provided by a comparison of the displacements shown in figure 9b with the changes in ellipsoidal distances upon complexing indicated by figure 9d. this comparison shows that while a number of residues of the h <dig> loop are significantly displaced, some move towards the domain interior of the heavy chain while others move away. figure  <dig> is ball and stick representation of three of the residues that are significantly displaced upon complexing. due to the severe h <dig> loop distortion upon binding this triplet is rotated from an orientation in which a residue initially pointing either up or down in figure 11a prior to complexing is reversed in direction in figure 11b after complexing. note, that aside from the h <dig> loop distortion, the heavy chain orientation has been held relatively fixed in both of the figures. all three of these residues have, therefore, experienced a significant displacement, as shown in figure 11b, from their location prior to complexing. however, while, glu <dig> moves away from the center of the n-terminal domain of the heavy chain upon binding, a rotation about its ca-cb bond enhances the motion of the residue centroids, asp <dig> and asn100a, to locations that are respectively, nearer to or more distant from the center of the heavy domain. all of these movements of these three amino acids are summarized simply by the complementary information provided by the two figures, 9b and 9d.

CONCLUSIONS
a new approach, enabling comparison between different, however, structurally related domains, has been applied in determining the structural changes that an antibody protein domain experiences upon its interaction with an antigenic target. the present procedure, while analogous to previous procedures that utilize common symmetry elements for comparison, utilizes, instead, the sets of principal axes of the relatively invariant global structures or substructures of the domains undergoing comparison. an ellipsoidal characterization of these structures yields two spatial metrics that provide complementary information; one, detailing the magnitude of the residue displacements and the other; their direction of their displacement with respect to either the domain exterior or interior. the information provided by the present procedure should augment related information provided by more customary procedures. hopefully such information will contribute to the attempts to design synthetic vaccines on the basis of x-ray structures of anti-body-peptide complexes  <cit> .
