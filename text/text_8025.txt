BACKGROUND
methanol naturally occurs in most ecosystems and is the second most abundant organic gas in the atmosphere besides methane  <cit> . the major source for methanol is the emission by plants  <cit> . also the decay of plants, biomass burning or atmospheric oxidation of methane give rise to methanol  <cit> . one example of microbial production of methanol in nature is the pectin degradation by clostridium butyricum  <cit> .

methanol itself is cytotoxic since it affects the fluidity of cellular membranes and alters their mechanical stability  <cit> . membrane disruption has been reported for incubation with more than 44 % methanol  <cit> . also indirect toxic effects related to methanol have been reported, mostly due to accumulation of the methanol degradation products formaldehyde and formate. formaldehyde is a potent cytotoxin due to its high reactivity with proteins and dna  <cit> . in mammalian species, toxicity of methanol is mainly attributed to an accumulation of formate, causing metabolic acidosis  <cit> . formate has also been demonstrated to inhibit mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase of mammals  <cit> . additionally, the oxidation of methanol and its metabolites is often accompanied by the generation of superoxide anions, which give rise to oxidative stress and may be involved in lipid peroxidation  <cit> .

according to its high abundance, degradation of methanol is a common feature in nature. besides detoxification, methanol can also be utilized as a carbon and energy source by a wide variety of eukaryotic and prokaryotic methylotrophs  <cit> . metabolism of methanol is typically initiated by its oxidation, which can be catalyzed by many different enzymes such as pyrroloquinoline quinone -dependent methanol dehydrogenase e.g. in methylobacterium extorquens  <cit> , class i alcohol dehydrogenase e.g. in humans  <cit>  or alcohol oxidase e.g. in candida boidinii  <cit> .

the resulting formaldehyde is a branching point between detoxification pathways and the assimilation pathways in methylotrophs. in non-methylotroph organisms, the detoxification of formaldehyde typically occurs in linear pathways, in which formaldehyde is oxidized to formate by formaldehyde dehydrogenase and further to carbon dioxide catalyzed by formate dehydrogenase  <cit> .

the gram-positive bacterium corynebacterium glutamicum belongs to the mycolic acid-containing actinomycetes and is particularly known for its use in the million-ton-scale production of amino acids  <cit> . recent studies on this organism revealed that c. glutamicum possesses an endogenous pathway for the oxidation of methanol to carbon dioxide. in this pathway, the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde is mainly performed by the alcohol dehydrogenase adha , but at least one additional enzyme of hitherto unknown identity is also involved  <cit> . formaldehyde is oxidized by two distinct enzymes, the acetaldehyde dehydrogenase ald  and the mycothiol-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase fadh   <cit> . the resulting formate is subsequently converted to carbon dioxide by formate dehydrogenase fdhf  also involving the gene products encoded by cg <dig> and cg <dig>  <cit> . the electron acceptor of fdh is currently unknown.

methanol tolerance can be a bottleneck in industrial biotechnology if the culture broth contains methanol, either as a part of the process or an impurity e.g. of the carbon source. for example, gluconobacter frateurii needed to be adapted to high methanol concentrations before it could be cultivated using methanol-containing raw glycerol as a substrate, which occurs as a byproduct during biodiesel production  <cit> . additionally, methanol represents an interesting upcoming carbon source for microbial production of chemicals  <cit>  e.g. cadaverine  <cit> . c. glutamicum cannot use methanol as sole carbon source  <cit> , although engineered strains do convert methanol to a certain degree to intracellular metabolites  <cit>  and to products such as cadaverine  <cit> .

however, c. glutamicum has been engineered to use pure glycerol for growth and amino acid production  <cit> , while certain technical qualities of glycerol obtained from bio-diesel factories, which contain methanol as impurity, were inhibitory  <cit> . the aim of this study was to improve the methanol tolerance of c. glutamicum. genome sequence analysis of an evolved strain and subsequent genetic and physiological experiments revealed that two single nucleotide polymorphisms  significantly increased the tolerance to methanol of c. glutamicum without directly affecting the methanol detoxification pathway.

RESULTS
biphasic, non-linear growth response of c. glutamicum wild type to methanol
in accordance with operation of linear methanol detoxification in c. glutamicum  <cit> , this bacterium is able to grow in the presence of up to  <dig>  m methanol reaching high biomass concentrations  <cit> . when c. glutamicum wild-type strain atcc  <dig> carrying the vector pvwex <dig> was grown in the presence of a wide range of methanol concentrations, however, the growth rate showed a non-linear dependency on methanol . in a first concentration range up to 120 mm methanol, a sharp decrease of the growth rate was observed with a growth rate in the presence of 120 mm methanol decreased by 30 %  as compared to growth without methanol . in the second concentration range from 480 mm to 3 m methanol, the growth rate gradually decreased but with a much smaller slope as e.g. increasing the methanol concentration eight fold from 120 mm to 960 mm only reduced the growth rate from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h- <dig> to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h− <dig> . the bi-phasic, non-linear dependence of the growth rate on the presence of methanol may indicate that the effect of methanol on growth of c. glutamicum may be more complex than anticipated.fig.  <dig> dependence of the growth rate of c. glutamicum wt and of two evolved mutant strains on the methanol concentration added to glucose minimal medium. growth rates of c. glutamicum wt  and the mutant strains tol <dig>  and tol <dig>  on minimal medium with 100 mm glucose and varying methanol concentrations



adaptive laboratory evolution of c. glutamicum in the presence of methanol
experimental evolution in selective medium was used to achieve a genetic adaption to the presence of methanol and thereby increasing the methanol tolerance of c. glutamicum. for this purpose, repeated cultivations with the wild-type strain atcc  <dig> carrying the vector pvwex <dig> were performed in minimal medium containing 120 mm methanol. after this selection process, growth of two independently isolated strains, named tol <dig> and tol <dig>  was analyzed in the presence and absence of methanol. in the absence of methanol, strains tol <dig> and tol <dig> and the parental strain c. glutamicum  showed similar growth behavior with a growth rate of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h- <dig> in glucose minimal medium. a comparison of the growth behavior at diverse methanol concentrations revealed that the methanol tolerant strains showed significantly increased growth rates at concentrations up to 1 m, while growth in the presence of 3 m methanol was neither observed for the evolved strains nor for the parental strain . interestingly, unlike the wild type, the dependence of the growth rate on methanol was almost linear for the tolerant strains , and lower methanol concentrations did not cause severe growth retardation of the tolerant strains. because both mutant strains showed a similar phenotype, only tol <dig> was used in further analyses to identify the mutation overcoming the strong growth impairment by low methanol concentrations.

role of the linear methanol detoxification pathway
c. glutamicum possesses the linear methanol detoxification pathway involving oxidation of methanol via formaldehyde and formate to carbon dioxide. in order to test whether methanol oxidation by tol <dig> differs from c. glutamicum wild type, enzyme activity of alcohol dehydrogenase adha was determined. the specific alcohol dehydrogenase activities with ethanol as substrate were comparable for c. glutamicum wild type  and tol <dig>  grown in lb. under inducing conditions  <cit> , i.e. after growth in lb with 325 mm ethanol, alcohol dehydrogenase activities increased in c. glutamicum wild type  and tol <dig> . moreover, as growth of an adha deletion mutant in glucose minimal medium with up to 960 mm methanol was comparable to that of c. glutamicum wild type , adha did not contribute notably to the response of c. glutamicum to methanol.

methanol oxidation gives rise to the highly toxic metabolite formaldehyde. in glucose minimal medium without formaldehyde, the growth rates were comparable for c. glutamicum wt  and tol <dig>  and they were decreased similarly to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h− <dig>  when formaldehyde was present . in addition, the specific activities of formaldehyde oxidizing enzymes ald and fadh determined by an in vivo assay  were comparable for both strains , respectively). in addition, growth of c. glutamicum tol <dig> and wt in the presence of 200 mm potassium formate, the second potentially toxic intermediate of the linear methanol oxidation pathway, was comparable . thus, c. glutamicum tol <dig> showed improved tolerance to methanol, but neither to formaldehyde nor to formate.

dna microarray analysis of global gene expression of c. glutamicum tol1
genome-wide gene expression analyses using microarrays were performed in order to identify differentially expressed genes in strain tol <dig>  which might contribute to methanol tolerance. in a first experiment, mrna levels of tol <dig> and c. glutamicum wt were compared during exponential growth in complex medium. the genes cysk and mety which are involved in amino acid metabolism and the prpd2b2c <dig> operon showed higher mrna levels in tol <dig> than in the parental strain . the prpd2b2c <dig> operon which codes for enzymes required for propionate metabolism shows a strong induction in presence of propionate  <cit> . to analyze if the increased expression of this operon positively affects growth with methanol, c. glutamicum wild type was grown in glucose minimal medium with 0 mm or 7 mm propionate and 120 mm methanol was added after two hours. methanol decreased the growth rate by about 45 % in the presence or absence of propionate , demonstrating that the induction of the prpd2b2c <dig> operon did not increase the tolerance to methanol.

in a second experiment, global gene expression changes of c. glutamicum tol <dig> and wt due to addition of methanol were compared. c. glutamicum wt was cultivated in glucose minimal medium with/without addition of 30 mm methanol. to avoid growth rate-dependent differences, the methanol tolerant strain tol <dig> was cultivated in the presence of 120 mm methanol, a methanol concentration leading to a comparable growth rate reduction. as consequence of methanol addition, expression of  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively, changed in c. glutamicum tol <dig> and wt, respectively . expression of only three genes, namely adha and two genes for hypothetical proteins , changed in both strains. it was observed that expression of genes responsible for ethanol utilization via acetate in the glyoxylate cycle  were induced in the wild type, but not in tol <dig>  since expression of these genes is activated in acetate minimal medium by transcriptional activator rama , growth of c. glutamicum Δrama in the presence of methanol was analyzed . however, growth of c. glutamicum Δrama and of the wild type in glucose minimal medium was similar without methanol  and with 480 mm methanol .fig.  <dig> venn diagram showing gene expression changes in a comparison of c. glutamicum tol <dig> with wild type. the strains were cultivated in minimal medium with 100 mm glucose in the presence or absence of methanol. genes with increased mrna levels in the presence of methanol are shown in the  section and genes with reduced mrna levels are shown in the  section of the graph



genome sequencing of tol <dig> and introduction of mutations into the wild-type genome
since neither physiological experiments and enzyme activity measurements nor dna microarray analysis revealed the mutation responsible for enhanced methanol tolerance of c. glutamicum tol <dig>  its genome was sequenced. compared to the published genome sequence of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> insertions, deletions or snps were found . previously, a similar number of changes has been observed when genomes of c. glutamicum mutants were sequenced  <cit> . therefore, all sequence changes found in the genome of tol <dig> were compared to the genome sequence of a control strain derived from the same wild type during the same period of time. only  <dig> mutations were unique for tol <dig>  of these, one snp representing a synonymous substitution, four snps located in intergenic regions and  <dig> snps in a gene  a putative secreted protein of the prophage cgp <dig>  <cit>  were not considered further.

the remaining five snps led to amino acid substitutions: a change of alanine to valine at position  <dig>  of conserved hypothetical protein encoded by cg <dig>  change l328s in the putative membrane protein encoded by cg <dig>  change d67h in the abc-type transporter subunit encoded by cg <dig> and change a165t in the o-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrolase mety. one snp caused a nonsense mutation  and resulted in a truncated version of coa transferase cat lacking the  <dig> c-terminal amino acids. these five mutations were introduced individually into the genome of c. glutamicum wt resulting in the strains t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  none of these mutations affected growth in glucose minimal medium or in complex medium . growth of strains t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig> in glucose minimal medium supplemented with 240 mm methanol was comparable to that of the wild type . however, strain t <dig> showed a slightly increased growth rate  in glucose minimal medium supplemented with 240 mm methanol as compared to wt , while strain t <dig> grew significantly faster  . the mutation of cat observed in tol <dig> caused a truncation of the enzyme at position  <dig>  thus, while the n-terminal acetyl-coa hydrolase/transferase domain  predicted by alignment to the conserved domain database   <cit>  is present, the respective c-terminal domain  is not. this severe modification may have changed its enzymatic  activity or caused a loss of enzyme function. to analyze if the latter causes the increased methanol tolerance, a cat deletion strain lacking both the n- and c-terminal regions of cat  <cit>  was analyzed. in the absence of methanol, this strain showed a slightly lower growth rate  than wt , while the growth rate of Δcat  was significantly higher than that of the wt  in minimal medium with 100 mm glucose and 240 mm methanol . these results indicated that the lack of cat activity improved methanol tolerance to a comparable extent as observed when cat was truncated due to the nonsense mutation .fig.  <dig> growth of various c. glutamicum strains in glucose minimal medium supplemented with 240 mm methanol. growth of c. glutamicum wt , tol <dig> , t <dig> , t <dig>  and t0755 +  <dig>  in minimal medium supplemented with 100 mm glucose and 240 mm methanol. means and standard deviations of two independent cultures are shown



when both mutations were combined, the resulting strain t0755 +  <dig> grew as fast  as tol <dig> in glucose minimal medium supplemented with 240 mm methanol . thus, the identified two mutations resulting in amino acid exchange a165t in the o-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrolase mety and in truncation  of coa transferase were sufficient to explain the improved methanol tolerance of tol <dig> 

influence of mutations increasing methanol tolerance on growth with ethanol
c. glutamicum wild type is able to utilize ethanol, but not methanol, as sole carbon source  <cit> . to determine if one or both of the mutations increasing tolerance to methanol affects growth with ethanol as sole carbon source, growth experiments with c. glutamicum wt, tol <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> and t0755 +  <dig> in minimal medium containing 325 mm ethanol as sole carbon source were performed. surprisingly, strain tol <dig> showed no growth on ethanol, while c. glutamicum wt grew with a growth rate of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h− <dig> . strain t <dig> grew with ethanol at a growth rate of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  h− <dig>  but neither strain t <dig> nor strain t0755 +  <dig> were able to grow in ethanol minimal medium . thus, truncation of coa transferase cat due to missense mutation q342* as present in strains tol <dig>  t <dig> and t0755 +  <dig> resulted in the inability to utilize ethanol as sole source of carbon and energy. to test if a cat deletion mutant lacking both the n- and c-terminal parts of cat is able to grow, c. glutamicum wt, tol <dig>  t <dig> and Δcat was grown in minimal medium with 1 % ethanol as sole carbon source. while c. glutamicum wt could grow, strains tol <dig>  t <dig> and Δcat did not .fig.  <dig> growth of c. glutamicum mutants with ethanol. growth of c. glutamicum wt , tol <dig> , t <dig> , t <dig>  and t0755 +  <dig>  in minimal medium supplemented with  <dig>  % ethanol as sole source of carbon and energy. means and standard deviations of two independent cultures are shown



discussion
in this study, the response of c. glutamicum to methanol was characterized to be non-linear involving a sharp decrease of the growth rate in the presence of lower methanol concentrations and a less pronounced decrease evident at methanol concentrations in excess of about 250 mm. genome sequencing of a strain selected by adaptive laboratory evolution identified two snps that subsequently were shown to be sufficient to explain increased methanol tolerance of the selected strain. the relevant snps led to amino acid substitution a165t in the o-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrolase mety and in truncation  of coa transferase by  <dig> amino acids.

mutations which increase the tolerance to methanol in other organisms are so far reported to be mostly related to enzymes of methanol pathways and thereby reducing the accumulation of toxic downstream metabolites. for example the methanol tolerance of dictyostelium increased significantly by loss of a catalase, which is supposed to be the main enzyme in this organism oxidizing methanol to formaldehyde  <cit> . also methanol tolerance of the methylotroph bacterium bacillus methanolicus is dependent on the activities of the methanol dehydrogenase mdh and the enzymes 3-hexulose 6-phosphate synthase  and 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase , responsible for utilization of formaldehyde  <cit> . however, in c. glutamicum deletion of adha did not affect methanol tolerance although the encoded alcohol dehydrogenase oxidizes methanol to formaldehyde. moreover, the evolved strain tol <dig> did not show increased tolerance to the methanol metabolites formaldehyde and formate. notably, growth of tol <dig> was not impaired as drastic as c. glutamicum wt at methanol concentrations up to 120 mm, while the maximal methanol concentration tolerated was similar for wt and tol <dig>  this argued that the sharp decline of the growth rate observed for c. glutamicum wt may be caused by methanol itself or compounds derived from methanol in reactions other than those of the linear methanol oxidation pathway. direct toxic effects of methanol are known to be based on its hydrophobic character, which is affecting the stability of the cellular membrane  <cit> . it has been shown that the tolerance to other membrane affecting alcohols like butanol could be increased by mutations in genes corresponding to membrane stability  <cit> . however, the identified mutations increasing methanol tolerance in c. glutamicum were not found in genes affecting membrane stability. the second component of the response of c. glutamicum to methanol evident at higher methanol concentrations may be due to membrane damages by methanol or toxicity of formate and formaldehyde.

the finding that mutations affecting o-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrolase mety and coa transferase cat were sufficient to explain increased methanol tolerance of c. glutamicum tol <dig> indicated that their enzymatic  reactions contribute to methanol toxicity and are prominent in particular at concentrations up to about 250 mm. in c. glutamicum, methionine functions as methyl donor and is synthesized either by transsulfuration or by direct sulfhydrylation catalyzed by mety  <cit> . in the reaction of mety, o-acetylhomoserine is directly converted to homocysteine using sulfide  <cit> . in addition, mety is also able to convert o-acetylhomoserine to methionine using methanethiol   <cit> . methanethiol is the thiol equivalent of methanol and it has been shown that mety from corynebacterium acetophilum and saccharomyces cerevisiae accepts methanol and other short-chain alcohols as substrates in addition to sulfide and methanethiol  <cit> . the mety-catalyzed alkylation of o-acetylhomoserine with methanol yields o-methylhomoserine and acetate . since o-methylhomoserine is known to inhibit growth of e. coli and other microorganisms  <cit> , this mety-catalyzed reaction may contribute to the methanol toxicity of c. glutamicum. strain tol <dig> synthesized a variant of mety  and showed higher rna levels of mety in complex medium with added methanol than c. glutamicum wt . albeit strain tol <dig> was not further investigated since o-acetylhomoserine could not be obtained, the location of a <dig> close to a substrate-cofactor binding motif predicted by cdd-alignment  <cit>  may indicate that binding of the cofactor pyridoxal-5-phosphate, which is essential for the function of mety  <cit> , and mety activity are affected. while mety clearly contributed to methanol toxicity in c. glutamicum, the biochemical mechanism remains to be explored by combining in vitro and in vivo approaches such as metabolomics and structure-function analyses of mety and metya165t.

the second mutation contributing to increased methanol tolerance of strain tol <dig> led to truncation of coa transferase cat. cat transfers coa between acetyl-, propionyl- and succinyl-coa thioesters and the respective free acids  <cit> . whereas it is known that cat is highly and constitutively expressed  <cit> , its function remains elusive since only a role in acetate and propionate catabolism in the absence of acetate kinase ack and phosphotransacetylase pta during co-consumption with glucose was found  <cit> . both the lack of cat activity due to deletion of cat as well as its truncation due to the snp present in strain tol <dig> increased the methanol tolerance. thus, either the activity of coa transfer between the acids acetate, propionate or succinate and the respective thioesters  <cit> , or enzymatic side activity of cat result in reduced growth in the presence of methanol. several side reactions appear possible and although not all of them have been documented, in other organisms coa transferases may have activity as acetyl-coa hydrolases, as alcohol acetyltransferases or may form methyl-coa. alcohol acetyltransferases e.g. from saccharomyces uvarum catalyze the transfer of the acetyl moiety from acetyl-coa to methanol resulting in methyl acetate ester  <cit> . methyl-coenzyme m is an intermediate in methanogenic archaea like methanosarcina barkeri and is formed by methanol:coenzyme m methyltransferase  <cit> . due to structural similarities of the coenzymes a and m, an analogous reaction of methanol with coenzyme a might be possible. future metabolomics and structure-function analyses are necessary to determine if cat from c. glutamicum wt, but not from tol <dig>  also possesses activity as acetyl-coa hydrolase, alcohol acetyltransferase or for generation of methyl-coa and if the resulting intermediates are growth inhibitory. this also pertains to the finding that truncation of cat as well as the absence of cat precluded use of ethanol as sole source of carbon and energy. it is not clear whether increased methanol tolerance and the inability to use ethanol are interdependent or arose by chance as consequence of cat truncation.

growth of c. glutamicum with ethanol involves oxidation of ethanol to acetate and requires activation by the pta/ack-system and operation of the glyoxylate cycle  <cit> . thus, acetyl-coa is an essential intermediate of ethanol metabolism and its concentration would be reduced if truncated cat were active as acetyl-coa hydrolase. alternatively, induction of genes ack, pta, acea and aceb by ethanol  <cit> , which is as high as induction by acetate  <cit>  or methanol  <cit>  may be impaired by truncated cat. indeed, induction of these genes was not observed in tol <dig> . the genes ack, pta, acea are directly repressed by ramb  <cit>  and activated by rama  <cit> . acea and aceb are directly repressed by glxr, but regulation of the pta-ack operon by glxr has not yet been demonstrated in vivo. glxr and sugr indirectly control these genes by regulation of rama expression  <cit> . c. glutamicum mutants lacking rama cannot grow with acetate or ethanol as sole carbon sources  <cit> . the physiological trigger for the regulation of the ethanol and acetate metabolism is still unknown, but has been inferred as acetyl-coa or a derivative thereof based on missing induction of genes from the acetate metabolism as result of interrupted ack and pta genes  <cit> . thus, the inducer may not be synthesized or may be degraded by truncated cat.

the identified mutations increasing methanol tolerance of c. glutamicum are relevant to strain development for biotechnological applications either using methanol as substrate or using growth substrates containing methanol as impurity. the latter was already shown to be of biotechnological relevance since c. glutamicum engineered to utilize glycerol for growth and amino acid production readily used pure glycerol, but not all technical qualities of glycerol  <cit> . crude glycerol is a by-product of biodiesel production by transesterification of plant fats with methanol and often contains residual methanol  <cit> . producer strains carrying the mutations of mety and cat may show improved performance in processes based on crude glycerol.

CONCLUSIONS
a c. glutamicum strain with increased methanol tolerance was selected by adaptive laboratory evolution. genome sequencing of this strain identified two snps leading to amino acid substitution a165t of the o-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrolase mety and truncation  of coa transferase by  <dig> amino acids. introduction of these mutations into the wild type improved tolerance to methanol to the same level as observed with the selected mutant tol <dig>  thus, these two mutations were sufficient to explain increased methanol tolerance of the selected strain. introduction of these mutations into producer strains may facilitate production processes when using methanol as substrate or using growth substrates containing methanol as impurity.
