BACKGROUND
constitutive and regulated ppis are the main organizing principles within signaling cascades the integration of which results in an adaptive cellular behaviour. modification-dependent ppis are often positioned at pivotal positions within signaling pathways, and are thus central to signaling processes at the membrane and in the cytosol of living mammalian cells  <cit> . phosphorylation of specific serine or threonine residues by kinases represents the prototype and most abundant type of post-translational protein modifications  <cit> . in light of the fact that cellular signaling is altered in many disease conditions, functional subunits of signaling processes are the focus of intense research, since they represent attractive targets for pharmacological intervention  <cit> . in contrast to constitutive ppis, stimulus-regulated ppis often depend on small post-translational modifications, and are thus better suited targets for drug development  <cit> . however, the detection of modification-dependent ppis with biochemical methods still remains a labour- and material-intensive task, and many pivotal ppis potentially suited for pharmacological perturbation most likely still remain to be identified. therefore, the availability of methods to easily screen and identify stimulus-dependent, potentially transient, interaction events is essential. ideally, the assays should be applicable to intact mammalian cells, including cultured primary cells.

recently, we reported the development of the split-tev approach that allowed us to monitor the ligand-induced dimerisation of erbb receptors at the membrane of mammalian cells  <cit> . split-tev is based on the functional complementation of two inactive tev protease fragments fused to interacting proteins. the ppi-dependent tev protease activity can be followed by several reporters, which either rely on a fluorescent or a luminescent readout  <cit> . in this study, we wanted to adapt the split-tev system to analyse constitutive and phosphorylation-dependent interactions of full-length proteins that occur in the cytosol and at the membrane. for the technical proof-of-principle for cytosolic interactions, we chose the interactions between bad and 14-3- <dig> isoforms as a model system  <cit> . both, the 14-3- <dig> and bad proteins are involved in the regulation of apoptosis and survival signaling  <cit> . bad is a pro-apoptotic protein exerting its action by binding to the anti-apoptotic, mitochondrially localised proteins bcl-xl and bcl <dig>  thereby inactivating the bcl proteins  <cit> . however, upon phosphorylation at serine  <dig> by protein kinase akt-1/pkb, bad can be complexed by 14-3- <dig> proteins in the cytosol, thus preventing the association with the bcl proteins and inhibiting apoptosis  <cit> . 14-3- <dig> proteins were shown to be involved in sequestering functions through binding to phoshorylated proteins and consequently influencing signaling events  <cit> . there are seven 14-3- <dig> genes giving rise to the seven isoforms β, γ, ε, η, σ, τ  and ζ. the 14-3- <dig> isoforms can functionally compensate for each other, but can also mediate specific cellular functions: the σ isoform for example is implicated in cancer and cell cycle regulation  <cit> , whereas the isoforms ε and ζ are highly expressed in postmitotic cells of the brain  <cit> . additionally, 14-3- <dig> proteins can homo- and heterodimerise  <cit> .

to demonstrate the applicability of the split-tev system to analyse phosphorylation-dependent interactions at the membrane, we chose stimulus-dependent interactions of the erbb <dig> receptor with various cytosolic adapter proteins. erbb <dig> belongs to the family of erbb receptor tyrosine kinases, which are involved in diverse signaling mechanisms ranging from proliferation to differentiation and neuronal specification  <cit> . upon ligand binding, erbb <dig> homo- or heterodimerises, followed by an autophosphorylation in trans, which then leads to the recruitment of sh <dig> domain-containing adaptor proteins, such as grb <dig>  shc <dig> and the regulatory subunit of pi3k   <cit> . neuregulin- <dig>  represents the best characterized erbb <dig> ligand and has been shown to be implicated several diseases, including cancer and schizophrenia  <cit> .

in this report, we measured the homo- and heterodimeric interactions of 14-3- <dig> isoforms and the modification-dependent interaction between full-length cytosolic bad and 14-3- <dig> isoforms ε and ζ in heterologous nih-3t <dig> cells and primary neurons using the split-tev system. moreover, we measured the nrg1-induced interactions of several sh2-adapter proteins with phosphorylated erbb <dig> in living cells.

RESULTS
split-tev reporters to monitor interactions of cytoplasmic proteins
protein-protein interactions can be measured using a protein complementation approach that is based on tev protease and is termed split-tev  <cit> . in this system, inactive tev protease fragments are fused to potentially interacting proteins. upon interaction the reconstituted functional protease activates genetically encoded tev-specific reporters  <cit> . the cytosolic reporters used are either proteolysis-only reporters requiring only one step of activation  or transcription-coupled reporters with a two-step activation, which consist of the proteolytic activation of the previously silent transcriptional activator gv and the transcriptional activation of a final reporter gene  . the functionality of all cytosolic reporters relies on the modified ligand binding domain of the estrogen receptor, termed ert <dig>  <cit> . for lucer, this domain substantially decreases the biological activity of the luciferase unit, and for gv-2er, gv is trapped in the cytosol, unless both ert <dig> domains are cleaved off  <cit> . using both types of reporters, we analyzed the modification dependent interaction of bad and 14-3- <dig>  as well as the constitutive association of 14-3- <dig> isoforms.

for 14-3- <dig> proteins, homo- and heterodimer formation has been demonstrated  <cit> . we first performed split-tev assays to monitor 14-3-3ε homodimerisation using the complete set of transcription-coupled and proteolysis-only reporters with luciferase-based  and fluorescent readouts . each reporter indicated a specific interaction of 14-3- <dig> dimers when compared to control assays. these control assays contained constructs coding for the coiled-coil domain from the gcn <dig> protein . with respect to the signal-to-noise ratio, the doubly ert2-flanked reporter redernuc performed best, followed by gv-2er and lucer. we used gv-2er and lucer for most experiments, since luciferase assays are less labour-intensive compared to quantitative fluorescence analysis. next, we examined the homo- and heterodimerisation of the 14-3- <dig> isoforms ε and ζ. here, the n-tev fragments were either n- or c-terminally fused to the 14-3- <dig> protein isoforms . all combinations displayed a comparable degree of activation and we did not observe reduced signals that may have been caused by structural constraints of the differently tagged fusion proteins. using split-tev assays with the gv-2er reporter, we were able to measure the constitutive association between 14-3-3ε and ζ in all possible combinations . corresponding assays with lucer showed similar results .

monitoring akt- <dig> dependent interactions of bad and 14-3- <dig> in nih-3t <dig> fibroblasts and pimary cultured cortical neurons
unphosphorylated bad promotes apoptosis, however upon phosphorylation of ser <dig> by akt-1/pkb bad binds to 14-3- <dig> proteins thereby inhibiting its pro-apoptotic activity  <cit> . to provide constant akt- <dig> activity, we generated a constitutively active form of murine akt- <dig>   <cit> , which lacks the ph domain, but contains an n-terminal myristoylation sequence directing the kinase to the plasma membrane . murine bad and a mutant, which cannot be phosphorylated at ser  <dig> , were fused to the n-terminal tev fragment. murine 14-3-3ε and 14-3-3ζ were both fused to the c-terminal tev fragment . western blot analysis verified the proper expression of all fusion constructs at expected molecular weights . phosphorylation of bad by the constitutive form of akt- <dig> should facilitate the interaction of n-tev-bad and 14-3-3-c-tev fusion proteins and subsequent reconstitution of the proteolytic activity of the complemented tev protease . upon co-transfection of constitutively active akt- <dig> with n-tev-bad and 14-3-3ε-c-tev or 14-3-3ζ-c-tev signal induction ratios of 22- or 26-fold were detected using the gv-2er reporter . when applying the cytosolic proteolysis-only reporter lucer, comparable results were obtained with slightly reduced induction levels . replacing bad by the bad-s136a mutant abolished the interaction completely, demonstrating that ser <dig> is the crucial residue for the interaction   <cit> . apoptosis promoted by non-phosphorylated bad and, conversely, survival signaling exerted by phosphorylated bad bound to 14-3- <dig>  may be observed  <cit> . when we normalized the readings obtained from the constitutively expressing renilla luciferase constructs to the number of cells, an effect of akt- <dig> and bad on the cellular state became evident. in the presence of constitutive akt- <dig> kinase activity, the renilla luciferase readings were elevated by approximately 3-fold . in contrast, when akt- <dig> was lacking, renilla readings were lower, as evidenced in the experiment using n-tev-bad and 14-3-3ζ-c-tev fusions . when the phosphorylation deficient bad-s136a variant was used, renilla firefly readings remained unaltered in the presence or absence of akt- <dig>  analogous measurements were obtained using the 14-3-3ε isoform . we could also observe a several-fold increase in the relative firefly reporter activity if only both wild-type bad and constitutively active akt- <dig> were present. to determine the ratio of exogenously added akt and bad versus the endogenous proteins, we performed western blots from nih-3t <dig> cell lysates singly transfected with akt or bad. dna amounts used for transfection were proportional to those used in the luciferase assays. expression levels of the ha-tagged constitutively active akt mutant over endogenous akt was found to be approximately  <dig>  fold . the levels of the n-tev-bad and n-tev-bad-s136a fusion proteins were approximately 3- and  <dig> -fold compared to endogenous bad . transfection efficacies of nih-3t <dig> cells were found to be  <dig> ± 2% and  <dig> ± 3% for eyfp-bad and eyfp-bads136a, respectively, based on facs analysis . thus, as judged by the transfection efficiency of single plasmids, the average level of overexpression in individual cells will be increased by 5-fold. this calculation, however, can only serve as an estimation for the split-tev assays, since up to five different plasmids are co-transfected, and most likely only a minor fraction of cells will receive a proportional amount of all plasmids. we monitored the subcellular distribution of the eyfp-bad and eyfp-bads136a fusion constructs by epifluorescent microscopy with and without co-transfected akt- <dig> and could not detect altereded subcellular localizations .

applying these split-tev assays in primary cultured cortical neurons gave similar results for the akt- <dig> dependent interaction of bad and the 14-3-3ε and ζ isoforms . our results also provide evidence for a function of these brain-enriched 14-3- <dig> isoforms with respect to neuronal survival .

monitoring bad and 14-3- <dig> interactions by transiently activated endogenous akt-1
phosphorylation regulates akt- <dig> and can be used as a surrogate marker for its activation  <cit> . we determined the level of endogenously phosphorylated akt- <dig> in stimulated nih-3t <dig> fibroblasts by western blotting using an antibody directed against the activated, phosphorylated form of akt- <dig>  in parallel, we measured the interaction of bad and 14-3- <dig> using split-tev assays. akt- <dig> phosphorylation was determined in extracts of either starved nih-3t <dig> cells  or upon stimulation with 5% and 10% serum or with purified pdgf-bb . as a measure of the relative level of akt phosphorylation, we determined the pixel intensities of the resulting western blot bands obtained for endogenous akt and phosphorylated akt . peak levels of akt phosphorylation were detected  <dig> h post stimulation and already substantially reduced  <dig> h following stimulation. phosphorylation levels declined to baseline levels within  <dig> h. . in the corresponding split-tev assay, the bad/14-3- <dig> interaction was used as readout for the activated form of akt- <dig>  stimulations with 5% and 10% serum and the addition of pdgf substantially increased the readout. moreover, the increase was proportional to the relative activation of endogenous akt- <dig> with pdgf-bb being the most potent stimulus . thus, the split-tev assay can be used to measure this phosphorylation-dependent interaction induced by the transient activity of akt- <dig>  moreover, cells treated with increasing serum concentrations  or stimulated with pdgf-bb displayed increased renilla luciferase activity . however, the increase in renilla activity was markedly lower upon pdgf-bb treatment as compared to elevated serum concentrations . therefore, the split-tev assays are unlikely to be compromised by the stimulatory effects of the pdgf growth factor activity.

monitoring regulated bad and 14-3- <dig> interactions with a fluorescent reporter
fluorescent activated cell sorting  was used to quantify the akt-1-dependent interaction of n-tev-bad with 14-3-3ζ-c-tev. here, the readout was monitored using a nuclear targeted eyfp reporter in hek <dig>  and nih-3t <dig> cells . in both cell types a 3- to 4-fold increase in the number of yfp positive cells was observed, which was dependent on the presence of wild-type bad and constitutively active akt- <dig> . the akt-1-mediated effect was abrogated when the n-tev-bads136a mutant construct was used . in parallel, we stained dying cells with the cell-impermeable red fluorescent nuclear dye propidium iodide . under all conditions, the number of pi-positive or pi-yfp double-positive cells were not substantially altered  proving that the akt-1-mediated effects on the cellular state did not bias the split-tev assays using the eyfp reporter.

monitoring adapter interactions with nrg1-activated erbb <dig> receptors
finally, we used the well known phosphorylation-dependent interactions of cytosolic adapter proteins to nrg1-activated erbb <dig>  <cit>  to show the applicability of split-tev assays to monitor regulated interactions at the membrane of living cells. therefore, erbb <dig> was fused to n-tev and the artificial transactivator gal4-vp <dig>  separated by a tev protease cleavage site   . adapter proteins  were fused to c-tev fragments.

for the split-tev assays, we expressed a nrg- <dig> isoform  as a full-length protein  <cit> . to ensure that erbb <dig> is specifically activated at the cell membrane, nrg1-typeii-β1a was separately transfected into pc <dig> cells , whereas erbb <dig>  the adapters and the gv-dependent reporter were transfected into a second batch of pc <dig> cells  .  <dig> h post transfection cell populations  <dig> and  <dig> were mixed, and  <dig> h later the adapter/erbb <dig> receptor interactions were monitored. the experimental setup of this 2-population assay was confirmed by co-expressing eyfp in population  <dig> and ecfp in population  <dig>  fluorescence microscopy of yfp and cfp revealed the existence of two separate cellular populations with non-overlapping yellow and cyan positive cells being in close contact .

split-tev assays show that erbb4-n-tev-tevs-gv interacts with the adapters pi3kp85α-c-tev, pi3kp85β-c-tev, grb2-c-tev and shc1-c-tev only if nrg1-typeii-β1a was expressed in neighboring cells . the cytosolic protein fk506-binding protein-c-tev fusion protein  served as a negative control showing no activation in the presence or absence of nrg1-typeii-β1a . the corresponding renilla luciferase readings are highly similar between all assays showing that transfection efficiencies were similar, and that secondary stimulatory effects may have induced the assays . thus, inter- and intracellular signaling events can be monitored with appropriately designed split-tev assays in living cells.

discussion
protein modification-dependent ppis serve complex regulatory functions in cellular signaling cascades  <cit> . however, the quantitative analysis of these key cellular events still remains a challenging task. here, we apply split-tev assays to monitor constitutive and transient phosphorylation-dependent ppis that occur in the cytosol and at the membrane of living cells. thus, split-tev assays represent an alternative option towards the goal of analysing regulated ppis of full-length proteins within signaling cascades that occur both at the membrane and in the cytosol of living cells .

using split-tev, we analyzed the regulated interaction of bad with 14-3- <dig> isoforms in primary cultured neurons. cellular assays in most primary cultured cells, including neurons, still represent a major challenge due to lower transfection efficiencies and limited availability. with our transfection protocol, we routinely obtained transfection efficiencies of primary cultured neurons that did not exceed 10%. nonetheless, we were able to robustly measure the phosphorylation-dependent bad/14-3- <dig> interaction in our standard 96-well format. since observations in primary cultures may be more relevant to understand cell-type specific cellular signaling events, split-tev assays represent a particularly valuable tool to determine modification-regulated interaction profiles in these cells. although we mainly focused on luciferase-based reporters in this study, the fluorescent split-tev reporter redernuc displayed a high signal-to-noise ratio and may represent an additional readout option when cell numbers are limiting and/or transfection efficiencies are low.

in this report, the association of the pro-apoptotic bad and the adapter protein 14-3- <dig>  which only binds to phosphorylated bad, was quantified in heterologous cells and primary cultured neurons along with the effects on the cellular state evoked by the interaction itself. although the results obtained in nih-3t <dig> cells and primary cultured neurons showed the same tendency, the effect was less pronounced in primary neurons. this may be caused by the lower transfection efficiencies and/or expression levels obtained with primary neurons. in our assays, the transfection efficiencies of nih-3t <dig> cells vary between 20–30%, whereas the relative number of neurons transfected is generally lower than 10%. the cell type depending differences in transfection efficiencies may also explain the results that we obtained by facs analyses with hek <dig> and nih-3t <dig> cells using the fluorescent eyfpnuc reporter. although the results between the cell types and the different reporter systems  were highly similar, the relative robustness of the readout varied. in hek <dig>  the akt- <dig> dependent interaction of 14-3-3ζ-c-tev with n-tev-bad led to an activation of the reporter in almost 20% of all cells, whereas the maximum level of activation in nih-3t <dig> was below 2%. however, the relative induction ratios over controls  were comparable between cell lines. this difference could be due to variable numbers of plasmids taken up by individual cells, as up to five plasmids are required for the split-tev assays used. in nih-3t <dig> cells, split-tev was also successfully applied to measure endogenous phosphorylation levels of akt- <dig>  proving the high sensitivity of split-tev assays.

also, we monitored phosphorylation-dependent interactions between activated erbb <dig> receptor tyrosine kinases and several cytosolic adapter proteins in pc <dig> cells. in the presented 2-cell batch assays, erbb <dig> was stimulated by a full-length nrg <dig> variant expressed exclusively in neighbouring cells. the chosen isoform of nrg- <dig>  requires proteolytic cleavage by extracellulary proteases to yield a soluble, active form  <cit> . we conclude that the split-tev technique may be particularly suited to study weak and eventually transient protein interactions with a simple readout format even if complex membrane signaling is under investigation. given the enormous complexity of mutually dependent inter- and intracellular signaling processes, the need of scalable assay systems, such as the split-tev, is apparent. for example, the nrg <dig> gene generates at least  <dig> isoforms, which may have different signaling capabilities and/or different receptor affinities  <cit> . nrg <dig> isoforms can bind to erbb <dig> and erbb <dig> receptors with erbb <dig> having four splice variants itself. erbb receptors can form homo- and heterodimeric complexes exerting different signaling properties, making a differential receptor/adapter association analysis in living cells a valuable and highly challenging task. we have shown that split-tev assays can be designed to study pivotal inter- and intracellular signaling events in living cells with high sensitivity. given its flexibility and scalability, the split-tev technique may help to unravel the complexity of cellular signaling in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
split-tev assays may complement existing techniques to study phosphorylation-dependent and transient ppis that were induced by intrinsic kinase activities in living cells. the interactions can be monitored with full-length cytosolic proteins in heterologous cell lines as well as in primary cultured neurons. all assays were performed in multi-plate formats and could therefore be adapted to higher throughput to screen for pharmacological substances interfering with pivotal ppis within cellular signaling cascades.
