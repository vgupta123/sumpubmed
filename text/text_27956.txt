BACKGROUND
the electric eel  is a freshwater teleost  from south america, the only species identified to date within the genus electrophorus  <cit> . reaching more than seven feet in total length, e. electricus is most famous for its ability to generate strong voltage discharges  from electric organ  tissues for use in predation and defense. because of this remarkable ability, e. electricus has played a prominent role in the history of science – in physics, for early insights into the nature of electricity, and in biochemistry, as a rich source of tissue for extensive biochemical investigations of ion channels and pumps  <cit> .

over  <dig> species of electric fishes have been identified  <cit> , the vast majority of which are capable of generating only weak electric organ discharges  for the purpose of navigation and communication. like other members of gymnotiformes, e. electricus produces weak eods  for navigation and communication. however, it is unique within gymnotiformes in possessing three distinct eos , and it is the only gymnotiform capable of a strong-voltage eod. in e. electricus, strong eods are produced from the main eo and the anterior two-thirds of the more ventrally-positioned hunter’s eo; weak eods are produced from the sachs’ organ and the posterior one-third of the hunter’s organ . all three eos of e. electricus are derived developmentally from a germinal zone located on the ventral margin of the hypaxial musculature  <cit> . interestingly, the ability to produce eods is not limited to the gymnotiformes; indeed, electric organs have evolved independently from skeletal muscle at least six times in fishes  <cit> .figure  <dig>

despite the importance of electric fishes in the history of science, genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic approaches towards understanding the molecular nature of electrocytes  have only lately been undertaken  <cit> . in a recent report from this consortium, we described a small group of protein-coding genes that showed similar patterns of expression in electric organs as compared to skeletal muscle from three distinct lineages in which the electrogenic phenotype evolved independently  <cit> . included in this study was the first draft genome sequence of e. electricus, but a detailed analysis of gene content and tissue-specific expression in this electric fish species remained to be described. in this report, we describe the first comprehensive analysis of genes and multi-organ gene expression of e. electricus. our gene set enrichment analysis using gene ontology terms found that genes highly expressed in eos are enriched in functions pertaining to transmembrane transport, receptor signaling, and hormone binding. we performed the first analysis of microrna  expression in an electric fish and show that all three eos in e. electricus express a unique repertoire of mirnas, including a novel mirna and three conserved mirnas involved with muscle development inhibition in mammals. the results build a framework for comprehensively understanding the molecular nature of an electrocyte and provide a foundation for future work on electric organs in electric fish.

RESULTS
e. electricus genome features
we used next-generation sequencing technologies to sequence and assemble the genome of e. electricus and the transcriptome of the three eos and five other tissues: brain, spinal cord, heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney, as described previously  <cit>  . a set of  <dig>  gene models representing an estimated  <dig>  protein-coding genes was annotated from the genome and transcriptome. comparison between the genomes of e. electricus and danio rerio, the nearest related sequenced fish genome, showed considerable local synteny . the average intron size in e. electricus was similar to that of the other sequenced non-pufferfish teleosts and was ca. one-third that of d. rerio .

e. electricus transcriptome analysis
our comparison of genes expressed in eight organs of e. electricus  <cit>  showed that the mrna expression profiles of electrocytes found in the three eos  were distinct from all other cell types, with a greater similarity in gene expression to skeletal and heart muscle as compared to kidney, brain or spinal cord . this finding was consistent with the known myogenic origin of electrocytes in most species  <cit> . variance filtering of the gene models predicted in our first computational annotation removed ~ 3/ <dig> of the genes with low covariance among tissues. a subsequent k-means clustering  revealed sets of tissue-specific co-transcriptionally regulated genes . of particular interest were clusters  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which represented genes over-expressed only in eos , genes over-expressed in skeletal and heart muscle , genes over-expressed in both skeletal muscle and eo , genes over-expressed in skeletal muscle, heart and eo , and genes over-expressed in brain, spinal cord and eo  . clusters  <dig> and  <dig> represented a shared identity between electrocytes and myocytes, while clusters  <dig> and  <dig> represented sets of genes that were down- or up-regulated in electrocytes compared to myocytes and may hold clues to the unique structure and function of the eo.figure  <dig>

in order to understand what functions were enriched and best characterized in our tissue-specific expression clusters, we performed a gene ontology  enrichment analysis on each of the  <dig> tissue-specific clusters. this analysis revealed enriched functions that were consistent with expectations based on the tissues in the tissue-specific clusters . for example, gaba-a receptor activity, ionotropic glutamate receptor activity, and extracellular-glutamate-gated ion channel activity appear enriched in clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  both of which are gene clusters over-expressed in brain and spinal cord. in cluster  <dig> , enriched go terms are consistent with fish kidney , including several go terms involved with transmembrane transport as well as heme binding.

go analysis of cluster  <dig>  showed an enrichment of go terms involved with transmembrane transporting , while enriched go terms of cluster  <dig>  consisted of calcium-transporting atpase activity, voltage-gated calcium channel activity, and calcium ion binding, highlighting the well-known role of ca2+ in muscle contraction. in cluster  <dig> , the most enriched go terms involved the general category of transcriptional regulation, including sequence-specific dna binding, ligand-activated sequence-specific dna binding, and sequence-specific dna binding transcription factor activity, as well as go terms involved with acetylcholine receptor activity. in cluster  <dig> , the enriched go terms were involved in metabolism, such as nadp binding, nad  + transhydrogenase activity, and phosphofructokinase activity, as well as insulin-like growth factor  i and ii binding. in cluster  <dig> , the enriched go terms interestingly included voltage-gated ca2+ activity and ca2+ binding. additionally, cluster  <dig> shows enrichment in receptor binding, receptor activity, and hyaluronic acid binding.figure  <dig>

topgo was further used to generate go graphs for each of the five primary clusters of interest  using enriched go terms  as input . the findings were consistent with those of figure  <dig>  but additionally highlight highly represented categories unique to each cluster. especially informative are the go graphs generated for clusters  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the go graph generated for the enriched go terms in cluster  <dig>  has a large, highly represented group broadly characterized as metabolism . additionally, broad categories including actin/tropomyosin binding are also over-represented in cluster 6; this is intriguing, as the electrocytes have lost their contractile machinery. also, skeletal muscle cells and electrocytes are activated by acetylcholine, and this is reflected in the graph, including the go terms for acetylcholine-activated cation-selective channel activity and acetylcholine receptor activity.

similar to the results from cluster  <dig>  the go graph generated for the enriched terms in cluster  <dig>  had a highly represented, broad category of metabolism . finally, the cluster  <dig>  go graph has a highly represented group characterized as transmembrane transport . this group includes go terms such as voltage-gated sodium channel activity and inward rectifier k+ channel activity, which are directly involved in electric organ discharge . cluster  <dig> also includes go terms involved in hormone/androgen binding; this go term is physiologically relevant as eod has been shown to be regulated in part by the presence of sex hormones  <cit> .

hoxc cluster expression in eo
one surprise arising from the 8-tissue profiling was the elevated expression of hoxc10a, hoxc11a, hoxc12a and hoxc13a genes in all three electric organs . hox family members are well-known components of the regulatory machinery that specifies the anterior-posterior body axis of animals, and in many cases the spatial expression patterns of hox genes within tandem modules on the genome have been observed to correlate with spatial distribution of expression along that axis  <cit> . we observed the same set of hox genes  from the hoxca cluster to be over-expressed in two other gymnotiformes  and one mormyrid  as well ; interestingly, these hoxc genes are not highly expressed in the eo of the electric catfish malapterurus electricus . jawed vertebrates have four paralogous hox cluster genes , among which only the hoxc cluster was shown to be dispensable for body plan development. the entire cluster was lost in elasmobranch fishes and its deletion in mice caused only minor transformations of axial identity  <cit> . whether these are retained in adults to specify the predominant posterior location of the electrocytes in gymnotiformes and mormyrids  or have another function is not known. our observation raises the possibility of neofunctionalization of posterior hoxca genes in some species of electric fishes.

analysis of binding sites for highly upregulated transcription factors in eo
a significant future goal is to understand the mechanisms underlying eo development and maintenance. as a step toward that goal, a plausible hypothesis is that transcription factors highly upregulated in eo regulate distinctive characteristics of eo. based on this hypothesis, candidates for this set of important transcription factors were identified by their high expression ratios  in eo compared to skeletal muscle . within this set, a subset of transcription factors were particularly promising candidates because they were also highly expressed in eo compared to all five non-eo tissues including skeletal muscle: egr <dig> , six2a , hoxc11a , foxj <dig> , ar , pou3f <dig> , lbx <dig> , and hoxc10a .

one possible explanation for how cluster  <dig> genes become upregulated in eo is enrichment of binding sites within their promoters for one or more transcription factors that are themselves highly expressed in eo. to test this hypothesis, we examined putative promoter regions within cluster  <dig> genes for binding sites of  <dig> transcription factors highly expressed in eo relative to skeletal muscle, using  <dig> randomly-sampled genes as a background control . their dna binding sites were frequently found in putative promoter regions of cluster  <dig> genes . from testing the density of binding sites in promoters of all cluster  <dig> genes as a group compared with background controls, the smallest p-values suggesting binding site enrichment were found for transcription factors prrx1b  and lbx <dig>  . from the subset of  <dig> of the cluster  <dig> genes most highly expressed in eo relative to skeletal muscle , the smallest p-values suggesting enrichment were found for transcription factors prrx1b  and emx <dig> . we then compared the number of occurrences of each transcription factor binding site in the promoters of the  <dig> most highly expressed cluster  <dig> genes individually against our background control and found p-values smaller than  <dig>  for emx <dig>  lbx <dig>  pou3f <dig> , prrx1b, and sox <dig>  . these results suggest particular highly upregulated transcription factors that might contribute to upregulation of cluster  <dig> genes in eo through selective enrichment of their dna binding sites and are possible targets for further study. it is important to note, however, that none of these p-values remained significant at a 5% fdr after multiple testing correction, and that the magnitude of change compared to background for the genes/binding sites discussed was generally relatively small.

parallel evolution in the kir <dig> channel and the na+/k + −atpase
it has been reported that some electrocyte-specific ion channels involved in generating the electric discharge appear to be evolving at a higher than expected rate in electric fishes . two teleost-specific members  of the inward rectifying k+ channel  family are abundant in e. electricus electrocytes. a hallmark of kir <dig> channels is a highly conserved aspartate residue at the inner mouth of the channel that binds mg2+ and polyamines and plugs the channel at depolarizing voltages imparting rectification  <cit> . in the non-rectifying members of the kir family, there is an asparagine residue instead at that site. within the channels encoded by the gymnotiform kcnj2b and kcnj12b, both have an asparagine at the mg2+ binding site, suggesting that the gymnotiform electrocyte has a unique intracellular environment. in addition, the α <dig> isoform of the sodium pump, which is highly over-expressed in the electrocyte, shows an amino acid substitution at a conserved site . in an interesting case of parallel evolution, the same substitution occurs in squid, although there it is due to rna editing rather than a permanent change in the codon. this amino acid change is thought to enhance sodium transport  <cit> .

reduced vision and loss of opsin genes in e. electricus
diurnally active teleost fishes generally have four physiologically distinct cone types in their retinae; one with long, one with medium, and two with short wavelength-sensitive opsins  <cit> . in contrast, e. electricus is nocturnally active and often lives in muddy rivers and streams where the ambient light is strong in longer wavelengths  <cit> . we searched the e. electricus genome for opsin genes; interestingly, we found only long , and medium  but no short-wave sensitive  cone opsin genes . although possible, it is unlikely that this pattern is due to incomplete sequencing coverage of the genome as we also recovered a gene for the rod photopigment rhodopsin and numerous other teleost non-photopigment opsins such as melanopsin. we hypothesized that the lack of short-wave sensitive cone opsin genes may be shared with other species that live in similarly muddy and murky conditions. indeed, when we probed an est database of a species in a sister group of gymnotiformes, a non-electrogenic catfish  <cit> , we observed the same cone opsin profile as e. electricus.

mirna analysis: novel sequences and eo-specific expression
mirnas are an evolutionarily ancient class of small non-coding rnas that regulate many gene networks during animal development  <cit> . mirna composition and expression levels have been used as a molecular taxonomy approach for categorization of tissue types, description of cellular physiological states and even classification of disease states  <cit> . it has also been suggested that expansion of mirna families has played a central role in the remarkable morphological complexity among vertebrates  <cit> . to investigate the potential role of mirnas in electrocyte phenotype and function, we isolated and sequenced small rnas from the spinal cord, brain, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and all three eos of e. electricus. we identified  <dig> conserved mirnas belonging to  <dig> mirna families expressed in one or more of the eight tissues  <cit> . we also identified  <dig> novel mirnas from the set of unmatched reads with perfect matches to the e. electricus genome . as shown in other organisms, conserved mirnas tend to be more robustly expressed than species-specific mirnas  <cit>  . however, all novel mirnas found in e. electricus showed tissue-specific expression patterns, suggesting that they may serve specific functions in e. electricus.figure  <dig>

to investigate the role of mirnas in the eo, we performed hierarchical clustering of mirna expression across the eight e. electricus tissues. mirna expression patterns clustered nervous tissue from the brain and spinal cord separately from cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, and eos, and clustered eos more closely with skeletal muscle than cardiac muscle . indeed, from the  <dig> total mirnas identified  only  <dig> showed high differential expression between skeletal muscle and the three eos . conserved mirnas with lower expression in eo than in muscles have annotated roles in muscle development and differentiation in other organisms  <cit> . three of these mirnas are muscle-specific, also called “myomirs” , because they play critical roles in muscle development and function. in contrast, mirnas with higher expression in eo than in muscle include multiple mirnas with roles including inhibition of muscle differentiation   <cit> .figure  <dig>

the most upregulated mirna in eo compared to muscle is the novel mirna mir- <dig> . this electrocyte specific “electromir” was 30-fold higher in all three eos compared to skeletal muscle and was not detected in brain, spinal cord, kidney, or heart tissues of e. electricus. notably, mir- <dig> is expressed from a locus that is important to electrocyte function, an intron of the inward-rectifier k+ channel gene kcnj12b that is abundant in electrocytes. though it is expressed from a region overlapping the kcnj12b gene, mir- <dig> is expressed in the antisense direction from an intronic sequence that is unique to e. electricus . this “electromir” mir- <dig> has no known homologue in any fish or mammal to date.

to further probe the importance of the differentially expressed mirnas in eo function, we sequenced mirna libraries from the eo and skeletal muscle of a second electric fish, s. macrurus. this comparison revealed interesting differences and similarities between the two gymnotiformes species . electromir mir- <dig>  which is highly transcribed in e. electricus eo from the k+ channel intron, is not detected in s. macrurus, suggesting that it may be specific to e. electricus. in addition, our results indicate that, in contrast to the downregulation observed in e. electricus eo, s. macrurus eo expresses most myo-mirs at levels similar to those found in skeletal muscle. the continued expression of myomirs in s. macrurus eo is consistent with a more ‘muscle-like’ phenotype in this fish  <cit> . in contrast to myomirs, mirnas with annotated roles in inhibiting muscle differentiation are commonly upregulated in the eo of e. electricus and s. macrurus. these mirnas include mir-218a, which inhibits cardiac muscle development  <cit> , and the bicistronically-encoded mir-365a and mir-193a, which inhibit skeletal muscle development  <cit> .

discussion
the analyses presented here describe molecular comparison of e. electricus electric organs to muscle and other tissues and build off of this consortium’s previous work exploring the convergent evolution of electric organs in independent fish lineages  <cit> . analyses of the e. electricus genome identified a number of interesting characteristics. the e. electricus genome is approximately ~ <dig> mb in size, which is roughly half of that of d. rerio. by comparing gene models across available fish genomes, we found that e. electricus intron lengths were about one third that of d. rerio , which likely is a significant contributing factor to the difference in genome sizes among the sequenced non-pufferfish teleosts and d. rerio. we also found a number of genomic changes that contribute to the adaptation of e. electricus environment and physiology. for example, within the α <dig> subunit of the sodium pump, which is highly abundant in eo, there is an amino acid substitution that has been demonstrated previously to occur in squid and is thought to enhance sodium transport  <cit>  . given the important role of sodium transport in eod, this substitution may be important for electrocytes to rapidly relieve high internal  after depolarization. of interest, this finding seems to be specific to e. electricus, as e. virescens and s. macrurus do not share this substitution. as another example, e. electricus lives in muddy rivers and streams where short wavelength light is more easily filtered out  <cit> . we were unable to identify short-wave light sensitive opsin genes in the e. electricus genome despite being able to identify long and medium-wave opsin genes. upon examination of the non-electrogenic catfish that resides in a similar environment  <cit> , we observed a similar opsin profile. thus, the loss of short wavelength-sensitive opsins is likely adaptive as it allows for a greater number of photoreceptors with opsins in the most useful portions of the visual spectrum. the absence of short wavelength-sensitive opsins has also been reported in most mammals living under dim light conditions or which, like bats and cetaceans, utilize other specialized sensory systems   <cit> . it is interesting to note that catfish took a different path in adapting to nocturnal living by developing taste buds all over their body to ‘taste’ the environment  <cit> , much as electric fish sense their surroundings using electroreceptors.

one main goal of our research was to characterize the genes expressed in each of our eight tissues, with particular focus on understanding the unique repertoire of genes expressed in eo compared to skeletal muscle. to that end, we clustered our genes by similarity of expression , and within the resulting clusters employed go term enrichment techniques to characterize enriched functions . the eo-specific cluster  showed unique aspects of eo that are not shared with muscle . within this cluster, we found an abundance of genes with “transmembrane transporting” function and a lack of “cytoskeletal binding” and other contraction-related terms. this result reflected the tradeoff between contractility-related physiological function and increased electrogenic output. conversely, we identified an enrichment of metabolism-related genes within all myogenic tissues , which suggested that the basic metabolic processes in muscle are retained in electrocytes from myogenic precursors. recent efforts from this consortium have identified igf signaling as an important element in the independent evolution of electric organs  <cit> . interestingly, our functional enrichment analysis revealed enrichment for igf binding in myogenic tissues . looking into this further, although igf binding was enriched both in muscles and eo of e. electricus in the analyses presented here, only the regulators of this signaling pathway were up-regulated in electric organs compared to skeletal muscle in e. electricus, in other gymnotiformes, and in two other lineages of fishes with independently evolved electric organs  <cit> , indicating igf signaling likely has a specialized role in eo over muscle. as we previously reported  <cit> , our hypothesis is that igf signaling contributes to the increase in cell size of electrocytes over muscle fibers.

within the cluster of genes co-expressed in eo, brain, and spinal cord  we found enrichment for terms pertaining to ca2+ transport and binding. this may highlight a gain of an additional ca2+ function in eo that utilizes genes expressed typically in brain and spinal cord despite no need for ca2+ for contraction . however, we cannot rule out the possibility that nerve contamination in eo tissue  contributed to this result, a possibility that would require additional experimentation to rule out.

a crucial step in our greater quest to elucidate the mechanisms by which electric organs have evolved is understanding the underlying principles of how genes are regulated in eo compared to muscle. given that several transcription factors are highly upregulated in eo, we hypothesized that there may be enrichment of these transcription factor binding sites in the promoters of genes that are also highly expressed in eo. however, our attempts at identifying enriched binding motifs within the promoters of genes highly expressed in eo  failed to identify a “smoking gun”; thus, it is reasonable to suspect that other mechanisms beyond enrichment of dna binding sites for highly expressed transcription factors in eo might be responsible for regulation of cluster  <dig> genes. first, binding sites for transcription factors that are not upregulated might be enriched in cluster  <dig> genes and lead to transcriptional upregulation in eo. this mechanism, however, does not explain the restriction of cluster  <dig> gene upregulation to only eo. as an additional mechanism, factors regulating gene transcription, including chromatin state, might differentially affect availability of these binding sites in cluster  <dig> genes compared to availability in genes of other clusters. the upregulation of seven transcription factor genes  in eo from four electric fishes   <cit>  suggests their particular importance in eo identity. the lack of enrichment of binding sites for these seven, however, suggests that other mechanisms beyond transcription factor upregulation are involved in expression of cluster  <dig> genes—an exciting area for future research studies.

mirnas play important roles in regulating gene networks throughout animal development  <cit> . we aimed to characterize mirna expression in our eight tissues of interest, with particular focus on muscle and eo and with the goal to determine whether there was a potential role of mirna in eo development or maintenance. our analysis revealed nearly  <dig> conserved mirnas with known functions and  <dig> novel mirnas; these novel mirnas showed tissue-specific expression patterns which indicated they may be serving tissue-specific functions in e. electricus. of particular interest were the  <dig> mirnas that showed high differential expression among skeletal muscle and three eos , and, to gauge whether our findings were e. electricus-specific or shared among gymnotiformes, we also performed mirna sequencing and expression analysis on s. macrurus. of particular note were three conserved muscle-specific mirnas that were highly expressed in eo relative to skeletal muscle  in both gymnotiformes tested; these mirna have known roles in inhibiting muscle differentiation  <cit> . interestingly, we identified a novel “electromir” abundantly expressed in e. electricus eo but not identified in s. macrurus eo, implying that this novel mirna arose for e. electricus-specific electrocyte development and function . the upregulation of conserved mirnas with known roles in blocking muscle development in the eo of both e. electricus and s. macrurus provides evidence that mirnas are part of a common toolkit involved in the development and maintenance of the electrocyte phenotype in gymnotiformes. uncovering the functional role of mirnas that are uniquely expressed in e. electrophorus eos could shed light on the molecular mechanisms involved in the modification of the muscle program to give rise to such a specialized tissue as the eo.

CONCLUSIONS
we describe here an analysis of the first sequenced genome of an electric fish  and of mrna and mirna libraries from eight organs including the three electric organs. this study, which builds upon previous work from this group focusing on shared protein-coding gene expression patterns between eo and skeletal muscle in multiple independent lineages of electric fish  <cit> , provides a focused and thorough examination of both novel genomic characteristics as well as protein- and microrna-encoding gene expression patterns and gene set enrichment in a panel of diverse organs from the strong voltage electric eel. genes expressed in electric organs were enriched for functions involving transmembrane transport, whereas skeletal muscle showed enrichment for contraction-related functions, reflecting the specialization of electrocytes for electrogenesis over contraction. gene expression shared between skeletal muscle and electric organs had functional enrichment for genes relating to metabolism, suggesting that metabolic characteristics of each cell type are similar even though the chemical energy is transduced to a different degree in terms of mechanical versus electrical energy. the first comprehensive analysis of mirna expression in electric fish identified three conserved mirnas that have known roles in inhibiting muscle development as highly expressed in electrocytes, suggesting that mirnas may be playing an important role in electrocyte development and maintenance. interestingly, one of the  <dig> novel mirnas identified was highly specific to eo and was transcribed from the reverse strand of an intron within the potassium channel that is also highly expressed in eo. future studies will build from the work presented here to understand more deeply the function and evolution of genes expressed in electric organs, including the molecular and evolutionary distinction of the strong voltage electric organ unique to e. electricus in the gymnotiformes lineage.
