BACKGROUND
the mitochondrial genomes of flowering plants exhibit a number of characteristics that distinguish them from the mitochondrial genomes of other eukaryotes  <cit> . they are large and variable in size with ample non-coding content  <cit> , including substantial amounts of "promiscuous" dna of nuclear and chloroplast origin  <cit>  as well as sequences of horizontal origin acquired from the mitochondrial genomes of other land plants  <cit> . angiosperm mitochondrial genomes also contain numerous introns, some of which have been split such that the resulting gene fragments must be transcribed separately and then trans-spliced together  <cit> . gene expression also relies on extensive c-to-u  rna editing, in which substitution of specific pyrimidines in the mrna sequence restores phylogenetically conserved codons  <cit> . plant mitochondrial genomes generally experience some of the slowest documented rates of nucleotide substitution  <cit>  but are subject to rapid structural evolution  <cit> . high frequency intra- and intermolecular recombination among large repeated sequences is the rule, generating a heterogeneous pool of genome configurations within a single individual  <cit> . the size and complexity of plant mitochondrial genomes, especially when compared with animals and fungi, make them powerful models for exploring the forces affecting eukaryotic genome structure and evolution.

the genomes of plant mitochondria, like any organelle genome, depend on highly integrated functional coordination with the nucleus. for example, translation of mitochondrially-encoded genes requires a mix of nuclear and mitochondrially encoded components. plant mitochondrial genomes contain genes for their own rrna subunits as well as for some of the ribosomal proteins and trnas required for translation , but many necessary ribosomal protein and trna genes are located in the nuclear genome, so their gene products must be imported into the mitochondrion  <cit> . the trna population within plant mitochondria represents a particularly complex assemblage derived from at least  <dig> anciently divergent classes of genes  <cit> : 1) "native" trnas encoded in the mitochondrial genome and inherited from the α-proteobacterial progenitor of mitochondria, 2) chloroplast-like trnas, which are also encoded in the mitochondrial genome but which were acquired by functional gene transfer from the chloroplast genome during land plant evolution, and 3) nuclear-encoded trnas imported from the cytosol.

this mixture of trna genes is phylogenetically dynamic. sequenced plant mitochondrial genomes differ in both the number and the identity of trna genes that they contain   <cit> . likewise, ribosomal protein gene content in the mitochondrial genome is highly variable among plant lineages. the process of mitochondrial gene loss and functional transfer to the nucleus is active and ongoing in plants, and  <dig> of the  <dig> protein genes that have been subject to frequent loss across the angiosperm phylogeny encode ribosomal proteins  <cit> .

the caryophyllaceae represents one angiosperm lineage with a relatively high rate of mitochondrial gene loss/transfer. adams et al.  <cit>  used southern blots to show that  <dig> genera from this family  lack most mitochondrial protein genes outside the core set of  <dig> genes that are nearly universally conserved throughout angiosperms, and we recently reported that  <dig> species from a third genus  are similarly reduced in gene content  <cit> . the genus silene is of particular interest with respect to mitochondrial genome evolution and transmission  <cit> . this large genus exhibits substantial diversity in breeding system, including a high frequency of gynodioecy , which is often the result of mitochondrial mutations that induce cytoplasmic male sterility  <cit> . furthermore, silene species differ markedly in mitochondrial mutation rate  <cit>  and in the amount of mitochondrial sequence polymorphism that they maintain  <cit> . previous analyses of silene mitochondrial genomes, however, have been limited to individual gene sequences.

in this study, we report the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of silene latifolia, which confirms earlier findings of reduced mitochondrial protein gene content in the caryophyllaceae. we also found a reduction in trna gene content that is unprecedented in plants as well as a major increase in the substitution rate for some rrna genes. in addition, we use paired-end sequence data and southern blot hybridizations to analyze the complex structural dynamics of this genome, which are driven by a large recombining repeat sequence that is present in  <dig> copies. these methods could be used more broadly to explore the complex dynamics of mitochondrial genomes in established plant model systems.

methods
study species and plant material
silene latifolia poir.  is a short-lived, herbaceous perennial that is widespread in its native eurasia  <cit> . frequently associated with human disturbance, it is also introduced and invasive in other regions, including north america  <cit> . like other members of silene section elisanthe, s. latifolia has a dioecious breeding system with xy chromosomal sex determination  <cit> .

we grew seeds from a single maternal family in the greenhouse. these seeds were collected by d.r. sowell from a common garden experiment in oxford, england, but the maternal plant was derived from seed originally collected on the apple orchard falls trail in bedford county, virginia, usa. a voucher specimen from this family was deposited in the massey herbarium at virginia polytechnic institute and state university . fifteen weeks after the seeds were sown, we harvested  <dig> g of flowers and fresh green leaves from a total of  <dig> plants.

mitochondrial dna extraction, sequencing, assembly, and finishing
we followed previously published protocols for plant organelle dna extraction  <cit> , which yielded approximately  <dig> μg of mitochondrial dna. we confirmed the purity of the dna by digesting a  <dig> ng sample with psti and observing a well-defined electrophoretic banding pattern on an agarose gel.

library construction, cloning, shotgun sequencing, and genome assembly were performed by the genome center at washington university in st. louis. the genomic dna was fragmented using a hydroshear , end polished, and run on a  <dig> % agarose gel. a fraction of that gel corresponding to a 4- <dig>  kb size range was excised, purified and ligated into the psmart vector system . after transformation,  <dig> subclones were purified, cycle sequenced from both ends with bigdye v <dig>  , and analyzed on an abi  <dig> capillary sequencer, providing an average of 7× genome sequence coverage.

shotgun sequence data were assembled with phrap followed by manual sorting in consed to resolve misassemblies  <cit> . assembly gaps were closed by sequencing subclones with paired-end reads that mapped to the ends of adjacent contigs. regions with low quality or single read coverage were augmented by pcr and sanger sequencing of total cellular dna.

genome annotation
protein, rrna, and trna genes as well as regions of chloroplast origin were identified using blast and trnascan-se as described previously  <cit> . regions that were not annotated as belonging to one of these categories were used to search against the ncbi non-redundant nucleotide and protein databases  with blastn  and blastx . perfectly repeated sequences were identified with reputer  <cit> . the annotated genome sequence was deposited in genbank .

sequence analysis
previous studies have shown substantial variation in substitution rates among mitochondrial genes within the genus silene  <cit> . to quantify differences in substitution rate, we analyzed individual protein and rrna genes in a phylogenetic context with paml v <dig>   <cit> . for each gene, we included sequences from  <dig> seed plant species for which complete mitochondrial genome sequences are available. in these analyses, phylogenetic relationships among the species were constrained according to previous studies  <cit> . for protein genes, branch lengths were estimated in terms of both synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions per site with the program codeml as described previously  <cit> . for rrna genes, branch lengths were estimated in terms of substitutions per site with the program baseml. we employed a k <dig>  model of substitution for rrn <dig>  and an hky model for rrn <dig>  and rrn <dig> . for all  <dig> genes, we modeled rate variation among sites with a gamma distribution. these substitution models were chosen based on the results of likelihood ratio tests between pairs of competing models. because the annotated boundaries of rrna genes differ slightly across species, we trimmed all sequences to the shortest annotated length.

our analysis revealed a substantial elevation in substitution rate for rrn <dig> in s. latifolia. to determine the structural consequences of these substitutions we used the rnaeval program within the vienna rna package v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  to calculate the free energy of the predicted secondary structure for plant mitochondrial 5s rrna  <cit> . to test for selection for conservation of secondary structure in s. latifolia, we generated  <dig>  sequences by randomly placing  <dig> substitutions  into the beta vulgaris rrn <dig> sequence. beta vulgaris was chosen because it is the most closely related species with an available rrn <dig> sequence, and it appears to have maintained the ancestral sequence of core eudicots. we compared the free energy of the conserved 5s rrna secondary structure for s. latifolia to the distribution of values from the  <dig>  simulated sequences to determine whether the s. latifolia structure was more highly conserved than expected by chance.

southern blot hybridizations
we used southern blots to assess the existence and relative abundance of alternative genome conformations resulting from intramolecular recombination between large repeated sequences. total cellular dna was purified from individual fresh leaves using a sorbitol extraction method  <cit> . samples were taken from  <dig> individuals from each of  <dig> full-sib families. each of these families was generated by crossing a female from the family used for genome sequencing with a male from an unrelated family. between  <dig>  and  <dig> μg of genomic dna was digested with ecori , electrophoresed overnight on a  <dig> % agarose gel, and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane  by capillary blotting. two probes were generated to target single copy regions flanking large repeated sequences. the probes correspond to genomic positions  <dig> - <dig>  nt  and 5636- <dig> nt  and were generated with the following pcr primers: leftf <dig> 5'- agtctgcctttgtccgactg; leftr <dig> 5'- tccccttggggttcttatct; rightf <dig> 5'-tctttctttgcgctttcgat; rightr <dig> 5'-cattggcctttgcttcctt. the probes were labeled with digoxigenin  using roche's pcr labeling kit. the genomic blots were hybridized in an easyhyb buffer  with the dig-labeled probe at 42°c overnight, washed at high stringency , and detected using cdpstar . an exposure time of  <dig> to  <dig> minutes was sufficient to achieve clear bands on ecl film . preliminary data showed that, when amplified directly from genomic dna, the "right" probe yielded non-specific hybridization, so the pcr fragment was cloned in pgem t easy vector . the resulting plasmid was used as a template to generate the probe with the same pcr primers. the "left" probe was amplified directly from genomic dna.

RESULTS
genome size and organization
the sequenced s. latifolia mitochondrial genome can be mapped as a  <dig>  bp "master" circle with a total complexity of  <dig>  bp if only a single copy of perfectly repeated sequences greater than  <dig> bp is included . the majority of the repeated sequence in the genome is represented by a  <dig> bp "core" repeat sequence that is present in  <dig> identical copies, all of which are in the same  orientation relative to each other. most of the remaining repeated sequence is found in "extensions" of the core repeat. the extensions are identical stretches of sequence between  <dig> and  <dig> bp shared by  <dig> or more  of the flanking sequences on either the "left" or "right" side of the core repeat . with the exception of this 6-copy repeat and its extensions, the s. latifolia mitochondrial genome is relatively devoid of repeated sequences, containing only  <dig> other repeat families greater than  <dig> bp . each of these is a 2-copy repeat.

the master circle depicted in figure  <dig> represents only one of many possible genome conformations. no single circle is fully consistent with all the sequencing reads because there are numerous paired-end conflicts, i.e., cases where  <dig> reads from the same subclone map too far apart or in the wrong orientation. with default filtering settings in consed, these conflicts are exclusively associated with the large 6-copy repeat sequence, suggesting active intra- and intermolecular recombination among repeats  <cit> .

with  <dig> copies of the core repeat, there are  <dig> possible pairs of flanking sequences if all core repeats recombine with each other. of these,  <dig> pairs are supported by multiple subclones from our shotgun sequence data. the lack of evidence for the remaining  <dig> flanking pairs could reflect a reduced frequency or complete absence of these recombination products, but it may also be the result of stochastic sampling and/or cloning bias given our relatively low  sequencing coverage. to distinguish between these possibilities, we first performed  pcr with all possible pairwise combinations of primers designed for the left and right single-copy regions that flank each core repeat plus its repeat extensions. we detected all  <dig> possible flanking sequence pairs in dna extracted from a single leaf . we then utilized southern blots to assess the relative abundance of the various recombination products and confirm that the results from the pcr experiment were not simply an artefact of pcr-mediated recombination  <cit> . we separately hybridized probes representing one "left" single-copy flanking sequence and one "right" single-copy flanking sequence  to genomic dna digested with ecori. in each case, we detected  <dig> strong bands, corresponding to the expected sizes of the  <dig> possible recombination products . all  <dig> bands are of similar intensity, suggesting that the alternative conformations of the s. latifolia mitochondrial genome exist at relatively equal frequencies. the "right" probe also unexpectedly hybridized to a  <dig>  kb fragment, producing a seventh, fainter band that was present in a subset of the individuals . studies are ongoing to assess the possibility that this seventh band reflects the existence of sublimons and substoichiometric shifting in s. latifolia  <cit> .

gene content
protein genes
the s. latifolia mitochondrial genome contains intact and putatively functional copies for all  <dig> of the protein genes that are nearly universally conserved across the large sample of angiosperm mitochondrial genomes examined to date   <cit> . in contrast, the genome appears to lack functional copies for most of the  <dig> other protein genes that were ancestrally present in angiosperm mitochondrial genomes, but which have been subsequently lost, and for the most part, functionally transferred to the nucleus, many times during the course of angiosperm evolution  <cit> .

eleven of these  <dig> genes have little or no remnant in the genome, while most of the other  <dig> genes  appear to be pseudogenes. of this group, only rpl <dig> is fully intact relative to other angiosperms. it is possible that rps <dig> and rps <dig> are functional, but both of these genes show evidence of degeneration. the first exon  of rps <dig> has been lost, and the much larger second exon  exhibits a substantial 3' extension before the first in-frame stop codon relative to other angiosperms. the 5' portion of rps <dig> is altered by a frameshift mutation that is corrected after  <dig> bp by a second frameshift indel. the remaining genes either lack substantial regions that are conserved in other angiosperms  or are truncated by internal stop codons . based on these results, we have identified putatively functional genes and pseudogenes in figure  <dig>  though a more definitive classification will require detailed analysis of gene expression and function. regardless, it is apparent that the s. latifolia mitochondrial genome has lost a large fraction of the protein genes that were part of the ancestral angiosperm mitochondrial genome.

trna genes
the s. latifolia mitochondrial genome contains substantially fewer trna genes than any angiosperm mitochondrial genome sequenced to date. a search of the genome with blastn and trnascan-se identified only  <dig> trna genes, and at least  <dig> of these  are potential pseudogenes based on the presence of multiple substitutions and insertions in their anticodon loops. a third gene  shows an elevated substitution rate, but its anticodon and secondary structure appear largely intact . five of the  <dig> genes  are of chloroplast origin, representing apparently ancient cpdna transfers that pre-date the divergence between silene and beta. collectively, the genes encode a set of trnas that, even after including the potential pseudogenes and assuming expanded wobble pairing rules  <cit> , can translate only  <dig> of the  <dig> sense codons, encoding only  <dig> of the  <dig> amino acids . by comparison, mitochondrially-encoded trnas in beta vulgaris  can potentially recognize  <dig> codons, encoding  <dig> amino acids. therefore, it is likely that an unusually large fraction of the s. latifolia mitochondrial trna population is encoded in the nuclear genome and imported from the cytosol.

1the c in the first anticodon position of trni is assumed to be post-transcriptionally converted to lysidine, which pairs with a.

2trnfm transfers formylmethionine and therefore is assumed to recognize only the aug start codon. the genome also contains a gene with homology to the chloroplast trnm gene , but it has experienced a large expansion in its anticodon loop, making its functionality  uncertain .

3the genome contains a native trnp gene as well as a homolog of the chloroplast trnp gene. the chloroplast-derived copy is likely a pseudogene in s. latifolia, as it is believed to be in some other angiosperm mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . its anticodon loop has experienced multiple substitutions, including one that converts the ancestral ugg anticodon to agg .

rrna genes
like other angiosperm mitochondrial genomes, the s. latifolia genome contains genes encoding  <dig> ribosomal rna species . two divergent copies of the rrn <dig> gene are present, although one is likely non-functional, exhibiting  <dig> substantial insertions  and multiple substitutions that greatly reduce the stability of the widely conserved 5s rrna secondary structure .

intron and rna editing content
the s. latifolia mitochondrial genome contains a total of  <dig> group ii introns,  <dig> of which are trans-spliced. all  <dig> introns are found in protein genes, and all but one occur in genes that encode subunits of complex i . the s. latifolia lineage has lost the second nad <dig> intron and both of the cox <dig> introns found in other angiosperms  <cit> . it also lacks the group i intron in cox <dig>  which has been widely distributed across the angiosperm phylogeny by numerous horizontal transfer events  <cit> . a previous study identified a total of  <dig> c-to-u rna editing sites within the genome's protein genes, which is fewer than typically found in angiosperm mitochondrial genome but substantially more than observed in the rapidly evolving congeners s. noctiflora and s. conica  <cit> .

intergenic regions
a blast search of intergenic regions from the s. latifolia mitochondrial genome found that  <dig>  kb  of this sequence exhibits significant similarity to other land plant mitochondrial genomes . much of this conserved sequence is directly flanking annotated genes and likely represents regulatory elements, utrs and trans-spliced introns  <cit> . the genome also contains  <dig> open reading frames  related to the dna and rna polymerase genes found on linear mitochondrial plasmids in angiosperms and other eukaryotes  <cit> . these polymerase genes have also been integrated into the mitochondrial genomes in a number of other angiosperms  <cit> .

by searching the complete mitochondrial genome sequence against a collection of diverse chloroplast genomes, we identified a total of  <dig> bp of apparent chloroplast origin distributed in  <dig> fragments ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. the total chloroplast contribution represents  <dig> % of the genome, which is on the low end of the range of approximately  <dig> to 12% detected in other sequenced angiosperm mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . as found in other angiosperms, the s. latifolia mitochondrial genome also contains numerous sequences of apparent nuclear origin, including many regions with homology to  angiosperm transposable elements. nevertheless, based on our search criteria, more than  <dig>  kb of intergenic sequence  lacks detectable homology with any dna or protein sequence in the ncbi nt/nr databases.

nucleotide composition and codon usage
the s. latifolia mitochondrial genome has a  <dig> % gc content, which is slightly below the range of  <dig> % to  <dig> % observed in other sequenced angiosperm mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . the patterns of codon usage in protein genes  are very similar to other angiosperm mitochondrial genomes  <cit> , despite the significant changes in trna gene content in the s. latifolia genome.

substitution rates
based on a phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> complete plant mitochondrial genomes, silene latifolia consistently shows higher substitution rates than its sister lineage, beta vulgaris . for the most part, these differences are minor, and the substitution rates in s. latifolia are consistent with the low rates that generally characterize plant mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . there are, however,  <dig> notable outliers with more extreme elevations in substitution rate: the protein gene atp <dig> and the putatively functional copy of the ribosomal rrna gene rrn <dig> . elevated substitution rates for atp <dig> have previously been reported throughout silene  <cit> , but this study represents the first analysis of rrn <dig> in the genus.

despite their elevated substitution rates, both atp <dig> and rrn <dig> exhibit evidence of purifying selection, suggesting that they are still functionally expressed in the mitochondria. while the observed synonymous substitution rate in atp <dig> is more than 5-fold higher than in any other protein gene in s. latifolia, this is the only gene without a single inferred non-synonymous substitution, suggesting strong purifying selection on amino acid sequence . in the case of the ribosomal rrna gene rrn <dig> ,  <dig> of the  <dig> inferred substitutions occur in loops within the conserved secondary structure   <cit> . moreover, the  <dig> substitutions within helices are structurally conservative. two of those substitutions compensate for each other by altering both bases in a single pairing, resulting in a c:g to g:c change at positions 27: <dig> . the third substitution found at a conserved helix position  should still allow for base pairing . the one predicted change in secondary structure in s. latifolia results from a t-to-g substitution at position  <dig>  this position normally represents the first base of the terminal loop on that branch, but the substitution should allow it to pair with c <dig> and extend the preceding helix . as a result, the predicted secondary structure is slightly more stable in s. latifolia  than in other angiosperms . a simulation test that randomly placed mutations in rrn <dig> showed that, given the number of substitutions in s. latifolia, the conservation of secondary structure is much stronger than expected by chance . therefore, it appears that, despite its elevated substitution rate in s. latifolia, rrn <dig> is still under selection to maintain folding stability. in contrast, a second rrn <dig> copy in s. latifolia is likely a pseudogene, as it contains  <dig> insertions as well as  <dig> nucleotide substitutions that disrupt conserved base pairing in helices .

gene conversion between mitochondrial and chloroplast sequences
the distribution of substitutions contributing to the elevated rrn <dig> divergence in s. latifolia is noticeably clustered . one cluster of substitutions is likely the result of a gene conversion event in which a segment of at least  <dig> bp of rrn <dig> sequence was converted by a homologous chloroplast rrn <dig> gene . the boundaries of this apparent conversion tract correspond precisely to the beginning and end of helix  <dig>  in the secondary structure model for 16s rrna in escherichia coli  <cit> . therefore, the result of the gene conversion appears to have been a clean exchange of the entirety of this helix. the region appears to have been further modified by multiple substitutions and indels since the conversion event. evidence of this conversion is also present in s. vulgaris, but not in s. acaulis, indicating that it occurred after the split between the two silene subgenera but before the divergence of the major lineages in subgenus behenantha  <cit> . we did not find evidence of cpdna-mediated conversion in any other silene mitochondrial genes, including the rapidly evolving rrn <dig> and atp <dig> genes.

discussion
mitochondrial gene loss
the vast majority of genes in plant mitochondrial genomes can be placed into one of two functional categories: 1) bioenergetics, i.e., oxidative phosphorylation and atp synthesis  and 2) translational machinery . analysis of the phylogenetic distribution of protein genes across seed plants has clearly shown that ribosomal proteins are subject to more rapid rates of loss than genes involved in bioenergetics  <cit> . the complete sequence of the s. latifolia mitochondrial genome provides the first evidence that mitochondrial trna genes, another component of the organelle's translational machinery, can also be lost rapidly and in large numbers in plants. this finding is consistent with broader patterns in eukaryotic evolution, as numerous independent lineages have experienced the loss of most or even all of their mitochondrially-encoded trnas  <cit> . the present study also extends earlier work that found reduced protein gene content in  <dig> other genera in the caryophyllaceae  <cit> . the similar reduction in protein gene content in these  <dig> taxa suggests that much of the observed protein gene loss probably occurred prior to the diversification of this family, although some degree of parallel loss within the family is also possible.

protein genes that are lost from mitochondrial genomes can experience a variety of fates. for example, the evolutionary history of eukaryotes has been characterized by a massive physical transfer of genes from the mitochondrial genome to the nucleus. this process is ongoing in plants, and there are a number of well-established cases of such endosymbiotic gene transfer that have occurred since the divergence of angiosperms  <cit> . losses can also occur when a gene is functionally replaced by an anciently divergent homolog  <cit> , and when a protein or even an entire multi-subunit complex is no longer functionally required . in silene, an analysis of the s. vulgaris transcriptome  revealed evidence of nuclear copies for at least  <dig> of the protein genes that appear to have been functionally lost from the s. latifolia mitochondrial genome.

to the best of our knowledge, a functional transfer of a mitochondrial trna gene to the nucleus has never been documented. instead, mitochondrial trna gene loss is typically offset by importing trnas of eukaryotic nuclear origin from the cytosol  <cit> . therefore, it is likely that silene mitochondria import a greatly expanded set of nuclear trnas relative to other plants--a prediction that could be tested by purifying and sequencing silene organelle trnas.

in some specific cases, however, more complex evolutionary changes may be required to explain the loss of mitochondrially-encoded trnas. for example, in plant mitochondria, the function of trna-gln is dependent on coordinated enzymatic processes. aminoacyl trna synthetases play an essential role in translation by matching trnas with their corresponding amino acids, but plant organelles generally lack a gln trna synthetase. instead, trna-gln is typically aminoacylated by a glu trna synthetase followed by a chemical modification  to convert glu to gln  <cit> .

the gene encoding trna-gln  is present in all sequenced seed plant mitochondrial genomes with the exception of s. latifolia. the loss of the mitochondrially-encoded copy of trna-gln in s. latifolia raises several possibilities. first, it is conceivable that aminoacylation and amidation are carried out in the same fashion with an imported cytosolic trna-gln. this may be unlikely, however, because it would require associated changes in trna recognition for multiple enzymes. second, it is possible that, unlike other plants, s. latifolia imports the cytosolic gln trna synthetase into its mitochondria, allowing for direct aminoacylation of an imported trna-gln without the use of a glu intermediate. finally, it is possible that s. latifolia has experienced an unprecedented transfer of a functional trna gene  from the mitochondrial genome to the nucleus, where it is expressed and its product targeted back to the mitochondria. all of these possibilities should be investigated to better understand the mechanisms involved in the co-evolution of organellar and nuclear gene content.

it is intriguing that extensive gene loss in two components of silene mitochondrial translation machinery has been associated with accelerated evolutionary rates in a third component, rrna genes. this pattern raises the possibility of a correlated reduction in functional constraint across these  <dig> translational components. a general relaxation of selection on organelle translation has been observed in cases such as the chloroplasts of non-photosynthetic plants where the organelle's functional role has been greatly reduced  <cit> . however, we have no a priori reason to expect relaxed selection on mitochondrial gene expression in silene, and the distribution of substitutions in rrn <dig> suggests that its secondary structure is under strong selection to maintain function. broader comparative and functional analyses would be of value in assessing the extent to which correlated evolutionary pressures act on these  <dig> components of mitochondrial translation machinery.

an alternative interpretation of our results is that, rather than being lost, certain genes have been functionally retained in the mitochondrial genome but escaped detection by our annotation methods. for example, cryptic genes could result from accelerated rates of evolution or the proliferation of introns and rna editing sites  <cit> . although these explanations are unlikely given the generally slow rate of plant mtdna sequence evolution and the trend towards a reduced frequency of introns and rna editing in silene  <cit> , they certainly cannot be ruled out. likewise, it is possible that some of the gene fragments that we have classified as pseudogenes are functional. mitochondrial trnas often exhibit aberrant or non-canonical secondary structures, making detection of genes and the assessment of functionality more difficult  <cit> . under any of these scenarios, however, it is still evident that the s. latifolia lineage has experienced a period of significant evolutionary change in its mitochondrially-encoded translation machinery.

mitochondrial substitution rates and gene conversion with chloroplast genes
given that the divergence between mitochondria  and chloroplasts  spans billions of years of evolution  <cit> , the notion that gene conversion is occurring between their respective genomes is rather astonishing. nevertheless, examples of conversion between the mitochondrial atp <dig> and chloroplast atpa genes have been documented in multiple angiosperm lineages  <cit> . the s. latifolia mitochondrial genome sequence provides compelling evidence for a similar history of conversion in an rrna gene. evidence of recombination between divergent rrna sequences has also been found in free-living bacteria and archaea  <cit> , including one other example of a chimeric proteobacterial/cyanobacterial small subunit rrna  <cit> .

in all documented cases of apparent conversion between mitochondrial and chloroplast genes, the mitochondrial gene acted as the recipient, which may reflect the propensity of angiosperm mitochondrial genomes to acquire and retain "promiscuous sequences", including those of chloroplast origin. if a conversion event in silene did result from a copy of chloroplast rrn <dig> that had been incorporated into the mitochondrial genome, the promiscuous sequence must have been subsequently lost, because it is no longer present in the s. latifolia mitochondrial genome.

the history of gene conversion in s. latifolia rrn <dig> was readily detectable because the conversion tract  introduced a distinct cluster of  <dig> substitutions . these changes contributed to an accelerated rrn <dig> substitution rate in silene . although we did not identify other clusters of substitutions that could be readily explained by gene conversion with homologous chloroplast sequence, it is conceivable that more localized conversion events occurred but escaped detection. it would be difficult if not impossible to distinguish conversion events that introduce only  <dig> or  <dig> substitutions from de novo point mutations. it has been hypothesized that increases in the frequency of gene conversion with reverse transcribed mitochondrial mrna  might explain elevated evolutionary rates in some angiosperm mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . given the evidence for gene conversion between mitochondrial and chloroplast genes, the role of dna-mediated conversion between divergent homologs  should be investigated as another potential source of mutational input in plant mitochondrial genomes.

repeats, recombination, and genome structure
with rare exception  <cit> , the structure of angiosperm mitochondrial genomes is characterized by the presence of large repeated sequences that facilitate intra-and intermolecular recombination  <cit> . these repeats are generally present in  <dig> or sometimes  <dig> copies. in this study, we identified an unprecedented 6-copy family of large, actively recombining repeats in the s. latifolia mitochondrial genome. given a repeat family of this size and recombinational activity, there are  <dig> different possible conformations for the idealized "master circle", which differ in the precise order of the  <dig> single-copy regions. the genome structure depicted in figure  <dig> represents one of these possible conformations. however, the genome organization is much more complex than any single circular representation for at least  <dig> reasons. first, a 6-copy family of recombining repeats will potentially generate hundreds of possible subgenomic circles containing anywhere from  <dig> to  <dig> repeat loci, as well as a theoretically infinite number of supergenomic circles through multimerization. second, plant mitochondrial genomes have been shown to exist in vivo as a complex assemblage of linear, circular and branched molecules  <cit> .

as observed in cases of repeat families with lower copy number  <cit> , our southern blot hybridizations confirm the co-existence of multiple alternative genome conformations. the similar intensity of each band  suggests that recombination among the repeats is sufficiently frequent that the many possible pairs of flanking sequences occur at relatively equal levels, a condition defined as "recombinational equilibrium"  <cit> . moreover, the repeat copies appear to be completely identical in sequence, providing further evidence for a high rate of homogenization through recombination/gene conversion.

for this study, we utilized southern blots and in silico predictions from a completely sequenced plant mitochondrial genome to provide a semi-quantitative assessment of recombination activity. extending these methods to other sequenced genomes that differ in the number and size of repeat families could provide valuable comparative data on recombination activity in plant mitochondria. moreover, the advent of dna sequencing technologies  that produce deep sequencing coverage of large span paired-end libraries can provide an opportunity to generate quantitative estimates of the relative abundance of alternative genome conformations.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, the patterns of gene loss and divergence in the s. latifolia mitochondrial genome suggest a markedly expanded role for nuclear gene products in the translation of mitochondrial genes. furthermore, the novel, recombinationally active repeat structure of this genome represents a complex elaboration of one of the long list of unique features that distinguish plant mitochondrial genomes. with ongoing efforts to sequence the mitochondrial genomes of other silene species that differ profoundly in mitochondrial mutation rates and breeding system, the s. latifolia mitochondrial genome should provide a valuable comparative model for investigating the evolutionary forces that shape genome organization.
