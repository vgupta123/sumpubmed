BACKGROUND
dengue viruses are linear, single-stranded positive rna viruses rna) with an approximate size of about  <dig> kb. they are members of the genus flavivirus, family flaviviridae. dengue viruses are classified into four serotypes, which share 68-76% similarity in nucleotide sequence and 63-68% similarity in amino acid sequence  <cit> . the four serotypes of dengue virus can cause dengue fever , dengue hemorrhagic fever , and dengue shock syndrome , which are transmitted by aedes aegypti mosquitoes  <cit> . the world health organization reported that up to  <dig> million infections occur annually, with  <dig>  cases of dhf and  <dig>  deaths, mainly among children. since  <dig>  the number of countries reporting outbreaks of dhf has increased by more than 4-fold and continues to rise  <cit> .

the replication of dengue viral genome relies on an rna polymerase that has a poor proofreading capability, resulting in the accumulation of mutations in the genome. the resultant variants in the dengue viral population are called quasispecies  <cit> . quasispecies are believed to influence virus survival and evolution as well as disease pathogenesis. the study of viral quasispecies by whole genome sequencing has been hindered by the slow speed of conventional sequencing technique and the requirement for culturing or cloning the virus, which allows adaptation and selection to occur. recently, massively parallel pyrosequencing technology, such as the genome sequencer flx  system, has been used to study quasispecies of many viruses, including hiv, hepatitis b virus, and h5n <dig>  <cit> . pyrosequencing is cost-effective and fast, and the library preparation technology, called "empcr", can prepare hundreds of thousands of template fragments without cloning.

gs flx provides longer sequence lengths than previous platforms, with an average of  <dig> to  <dig> bases. moreover, gs flx has enhanced accuracy, with single-read accuracies of more than  <dig> % and very rare substitution errors   <cit> . bases with low quality scores increase the chance of error, especially in long homopolymer regions  <cit> . this study used the gs flx sequencing system to research quasispecies in the whole genome of dengue virus. we investigated the efficiency of the gs flx system and its template preparation procedure by simulating quasispecies. prototype strains of the four dengue virus serotypes were mixed at specific ratios before being sequenced and analyzed for whole genome coverage, coverage bias and frequencies of variations.

RESULTS
gs flx sequencing data
the samples of four mixed dengue virus serotypes were sequenced twice. templates were prepared as five overlapping dna fragments of approximately  <dig>  bp in the first sequencing run, and as two overlapping dna fragments of approximately  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp in the second sequencing run. from the first run  and the second run ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads with average lengths  <dig> and  <dig> bp were obtained, respectively . the read lengths from both runs were approximately normally distributed, with a tail on the left .

sequence alignment and data cleaning
duplicate reads were removed from both data sets. there were  <dig>   and  <dig>   unique reads from data  <dig> and data  <dig>  respectively. reads that contained ambiguous bases "n" were excluded from further analysis. the frequency of reads containing ambiguous bases "n" was  <dig> % in data  <dig> and  <dig> % in data  <dig>  the remaining reads were aligned to the complete genomes of the prototype strains and to dengue reference sequences. only  <dig> reads  in data  <dig> and  <dig> reads  in data  <dig> could not be aligned to the reference sequences. these unaligned reads were excluded. all reads were from randomly fragmented dengue genomes; therefore, most of them should align to their reference genomes from the first until the last base . as expected, most reads could be aligned with 90-100% length-alignment ;  <dig>  in data  <dig> and  <dig>  in data  <dig> had less than 80% length-alignment. we investigated further and found that the poorly aligned section of the sequence was mainly at the end of reads where the quality scores dropped. however, we also found some reads where one part could be aligned to one region and the other part could be aligned to another region of either the same or different serotypes. these reads could be interpreted as a large deletion or a recombination between strains or serotypes of dengue virus. this study used separately cultured dengue viruses; therefore, it was unlikely that recombination between serotypes had occurred. those reads with percent-length-alignment less than 80% were thus excluded from further analysis.

data analysis
dengue serotype and genotype mapping
reads that passed the exclusion criteria during data cleaning were classified into their corresponding serotypes based on their best match from the blast result. the best match was based on both percent length-alignment and match score, as provided by the blast algorithm. there were  <dig> reads  in data  <dig> and  <dig> reads  in data  <dig> that had the same best match score for more than one serotype/strain. these reads came from sequences in regions that are well conserved between dengue strains or serotypes. a summary of these data is shown in table  <dig>  reads mapped to denv <dig> were further classified into different genotypes based on alleles at the known mutated positions.

construction of a consensus sequence
a consensus sequence of each serotype was generated based on the major alleles at each position. the consensus sequences of all four serotypes from the two data sets exactly matched, except for one base at position  <dig>  of denv <dig>  further investigation showed that this position had a variation comprising two alleles. both data sets had the same set of alleles, and the minor allele frequency was nearly  <dig> . the major allele in data  <dig> became the minor allele in data  <dig> because of a small difference in allele frequency. therefore, when we constructed the consensus sequence based on the major allele, the base at this position was different.

when comparing the constructed consensus sequences against those deposited in genbank, the percent identities were more than 99% for serotypes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and more than 95% for serotype  <dig>  for serotype  <dig>  the full genome of the strain we used did not exist in the genbank database; therefore, we chose the most similar strain, as mentioned in the methods.

we sent the pcr fragments we used as templates for sanger-based sequencing and compared the results with the constructed consensus sequences. all bases read from sanger-based sequencing matched with the constructed consensus sequences. at the positions where there were base differences between the constructed consensus sequences and those in the genbank database, the sanger-based sequencing result confirmed the result obtained from the gs flx .

coverage depth and bias
we calculated the coverage depths of all four serotypes using reads that were mapped to their proper serotypes . the reads from gs flx covered the whole genome of all four serotypes, but the coverage depth varied. there were higher coverage peaks at the regions where the primers overlapped between each fragment. thus, we could use them as markers for the boundaries of each fragment. in data  <dig>  there were regions with significantly lower coverage depths, i.e. denv <dig> fragment  <dig> and  <dig>  and denv <dig> fragment  <dig>  to reduce the fluctuation of coverage depth, we reduced the number of template fragments from five to two. the coverage depth plot of data  <dig> clearly varied less than that of data  <dig> . the higher coverage peaks at the regions of primer overlap could still be observed around the boundary of the two fragments.

comparison of calculated frequencies and the input ratios
the calculated frequency of each serotype was close to the input ratios, except the frequency of denv <dig> in data  <dig> . we simulated the population of denv <dig> quasispecies using four genotypes of strain  <dig> and ngc at different input ratios. the calculated frequencies were in agreement with the expected values. the minimum frequency that could be reliably detected from both sequencing runs was 1%.

discussion
in this study, we assessed the feasibility of using  <dig> pyrosequencing to study quasispecies of the whole genome of dengue virus. we performed two sequencing runs with templates prepared from different sized pcr products. in the first run, we amplified the dengue genome as five fragments, with approximate sizes of  <dig>  kb. the  <dig>  kb product size gave a good yield and required only a few reactions to meet the amount needed for template preparation. however, there was an issue when performing dna fragmentation using a nebulizer on small  <dig>  kb dna fragments. the standard protocol for library preparation did not work well. the sizes of the randomly fragmented dna templates were still bigger than those recommended for sequencing. dna fragments of  <dig>  kb were too short for the standard protocol. therefore, the nitrogen gas pressure in the nebulization step was changed to  <dig> psi for  <dig> minute  <dig> seconds. this modified protocol generated random dna fragments with sizes in the recommended range, but the high nitrogen gas pressure caused a large amount of dna fragment loss, as previously reported  <cit> . another issue with the  <dig>  kb dna fragments was the fluctuation of coverage depth. technical issues, such as dna fragmentation of small pcr products and human errors when pooling many fragments together, could contribute to the fluctuation in coverage. to alleviate the problem, we reduced the number of templates from five to two. as a result, the coverage of data  <dig> fluctuated less than data  <dig> .

we found some reads where one part could be mapped to one serotype and the other part to another serotype, suggesting recombination. natural recombination was reported in denv <dig> strains  <cit> ; however, only evidence for intra-serotype recombination among dengue viruses has been reported, not for inter-serotype recombination  <cit> . in our study, we used dengue virus prototype strains from cell cultures. it was unlikely that inter-serotype recombination could have occurred. we hypothesize that this was an artifact and could lead to misinterpretation of sequencing pools of clinical samples. these sequences could have occurred from the self-ligation of small nebulized dna fragments during the step of adding adaptor a/b. according to the manual provided by roche applied science, the adaptor will ligate to a blunt ended dna fragment. therefore, blunt end dna templates themselves may become ligated to each other before the adaptor ligates to both of their ends.

recently, many viral quasispecies studies used next-generation sequencing  for study of viral diversity, for example hiv, hepatitis b virus, hepatitis c virus, and influenza h5n <dig> virus. however, most studies were done on specific genes or regions, not the whole genome. for the hiv studies,  <dig> pyrosequencing was used to identify rare variation at low frequency, usually focusing on drug resistance mutations  <cit> . only specific regions or genes were used for sequencing with ngs using amplicon sequencing  <cit>  and shotgun sequencing with dna fragment size ~ <dig>  kb  <cit> . the study of hepatitis b virus also use  <dig> pyrosequencing to detect drug resistant mutations in specific genes, using amplicon sequencing with a multiplex identifier sequence  <cit> . samples for the study were collected from hbv patients' plasma. moreover, pyrosequencing was used to identify intra-host hepatitis c variation using amplicon sequencing on the hypervariable region  <cit> . for the influenza h5n <dig> study, the whole genome of influenza h5n <dig> was sequencing by gs flx, with the goal of developing a diagnostic system for h5n <dig>  for the influenza genome, a single stranded shotgun library protocol was used for library construction  <cit> . those studies used pcr amplicons as templates; however, amplifying the whole genome to get pcr products suitable for  <dig> sequencing could be tedious, even for a small genome such as dengue virus. this study demonstrated that ngs could be used for studying quasispecies of dengue virus and validated the sensitivity of detection using simulated quasispecies.

CONCLUSIONS
pooled templates of four serotypes of dengue virus were sequenced by gs flx system. the obtained sequences covered the whole genome of dengue virus. more than 99% of all reads could be mapped back to the original serotypes. the data from both sequencing runs correlated well with each other. the method could reliably detect a dengue genotype present in a mixture with a frequency of more than 1%. the calculated ratios were in agreement with the input ratios. this study showed that gs flx system and our template preparation procedure could be used to study quasispecies of the whole genome of dengue virus.
