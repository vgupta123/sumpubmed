BACKGROUND
tuberculosis  remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the world, especially in the developing countries  <cit> . the disease is caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis  and approximately one third of the world's population has been infected by this pathogen. in a recent report, world health organization  estimated that there are  <dig>  million new tb cases around the world in  <dig>  <cit> .

in response to mtb infection, induction of cytokines by immune cells is an important defense mechanism. the infected macrophages secrete intercellular signaling factors, proinflammatory cytokines, to mediate the inflammatory response leading to the formation of granuloma and induction of t-cell mediated immunity  <cit> . in order to understand tb pathogenesis, signaling pathways induced by mycobacteria have long been a subject of interest. mitogen activated protein kinases  including extracellular signal-regulated kinase  <dig> and  <dig> , p <dig> mapk, and c-jun n-terminal kinase  have been implicated as important cellular signaling molecules activated by mycobacteria  <cit> . previous reports have shown that p <dig> mapk and erk1/ <dig> are required in the induction of tnf-α expression in human monocytes infected with m. tuberculosis h37rv  <cit> . we have further revealed the significant role of mapks in the signal transduction events of mycobacterial activation of primary human blood monocytes  leading to cytokine expressions via the interaction with pkr  <cit> . however, the subsequent events as to how mapk is regulated and how such regulation affects cytokine production in response to mycobacteria remain to be elucidated.

since mapks are activated by phosphorylation, dephosphorylation of mapks seems to be an efficient process to inactivate their activities. it can be achieved by specific protein kinase phosphatases which can remove the phosphate group from mapks. examples of these phosphatases include tyrosine phosphatases, serine/threonine phosphatases, and dual-specificity phosphatases . some dusps are also known as mapk phosphatases   <cit> . currently, there are at least  <dig> mkps identified, while mkp- <dig> is the most studied member of the family. the regulatory role of mkp- <dig> on cytokine induction is best demonstrated by mkp- <dig> knock-out  macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharide , a cell wall component of gram-negative bacteria. mkp- <dig> ko macrophages showed prolonged phosphorylation of p <dig> mapk and jnk as well as increased production of tnf-α in response to lps treatment  <cit> . consistent with these results, another group further revealed that lps-treated mkp- <dig> ko bone marrow-derived macrophages show increased ap- <dig> dna-binding activity  <cit> . also, they showed that lps-induced mkp- <dig> expression is dependent on myeloid differentiation factor  <dig>  and tir domain-containing adaptor inducing ifn-β   <cit> , thus demonstrating the role of mkp- <dig> in signal transduction.

not only lps, other tlr inducers including cpg, peptidoglycan, poly ic, and pam3cys can regulate cytokine expressions including tnf-α, il- <dig> via mkp- <dig> activities  <cit> . in these processes, mkp- <dig> serves to mitigate the undesirable effects of septic shock and maintain organ functions by restraining the inflammatory responses following bacterial infection. another example of mkp- <dig> function is the immune response to staphylococcus aureus , a gram positive bacteria. there are higher levels of cytokine production including tnf-α, il- <dig>  and mip-1α in mkp- <dig> ko mice infected with s. aureus  <cit> . also, the mice would have a rapid development of multi-organ dysfunction as well as faster mortality rate upon challenge with heat-killed s. aureus  <cit> . taken together, these results suggest that mkp- <dig> protects the host from overactivation of the immune system in response to gram negative or gram positive bacteria.

in the past, it was believed that different mkp/dusp family members have overlapping functions. however, the emergence of dusp <dig> turned the concept up side down  <cit> . it was shown that dusp <dig> behaves differently and is opposite to the function as stated above. in dusp <dig> ko cells, they produced less inflammatory mediators, implying that dusp <dig> may play a role in mediating instead of limiting inflammation. for instances, when dusp <dig> ko macrophages were treated with lps, there were less tnf, il- <dig>  nitric oxide, il-12-producing cells when compared to those of the wild type counterparts  <cit> . when the dusp <dig> ko bone marrow-derived mast cells were first sensitized with immunoglobulin e  receptor  and then stimulated with dinitrophenol-heat stable antigen, they produced lower tnf mrna levels, diminished il- <dig> production, less phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig>  p <dig> mapk, and less transcriptional activities by elk <dig> and nfat-ap- <dig>  <cit> .

these unexpected positive regulations of immune cell functions by dusp <dig> have been hypothesized to be due to crosstalks between mapks  <cit> . stimulation of ko mast cells and macrophages showed increases in phosphorylation of jnk. moreover, inhibition of jnk by small molecule inhibitors showed increases in phosphorylation of erk  <cit> . the authors also showed that there were physical interactions of dusp <dig> with erk <dig>  dusp <dig> with jnk <dig>  as well as dusp <dig> and p <dig> mapk after stimulation of the cells with dinitrophenol-heat stable antigen. nevertheless, the details of the crosstalks between mapks and phosphatases need further investigation. thus, the mkp family plays a critical role in the regulation of immune responses.

innate immune response protects the host from mtb infection by secretion of cytokines including tnf-α in immune cells. meanwhile, mapk is one of the critical proteins in the regulation of immunity and cytokine expression. since mapk is regulated by mkp- <dig> in response to lps and the activation of mapk is important in bcg-induced cytokine expression, we hypothesize that mkp- <dig> plays a critical role in the immune regulation of bcg in human monocytes. we examined the involvement of mkp- <dig> in bcg-induced mapk activation and its consequent cytokine expression. here, we present evidences that mkp- <dig> plays an unexpected role in the regulation of cytokine induction by bcg through its control of mapk phosphorylation.

RESULTS
different inducers show differential induction of mkp-1
it has been reported that many inducers including growth factors, lps, peptidoglycan, and dexamethasone can stimulate the expression of mkp- <dig> in human macrophages, microglia, mast cells or fibroblasts  <cit> . to investigate the role of different tlr inducers in mkp- <dig> induction process in human blood monocytes, the level of mkp- <dig> mrna was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction  method. pbmo were isolated from primary human blood mononuclear cells and stimulated with pam3cys , poly ic , or lps  for  <dig> and  <dig> hours. following exposure to pam3cys or lps, there were significant inductions of mkp- <dig> mrna levels within  <dig> hour of treatment . these effects on mkp- <dig> induction continued for  <dig> hours post-treatment with pam3cys . in contrast, poly ic did not induce mkp- <dig> . the results indicate that different inducers showed differential up-regulation of mkp- <dig> expression.

lps induces mkp- <dig> transcription
lps has been extensively used to demonstrate the role of mkp- <dig> in immune response both in vivo and in vitro  <cit> . to establish a foundation for interpretation of subsequent experimental results, lps was used as a positive control for the induction of mkp- <dig> expression. to determine the levels of mkp- <dig> in response to lps, kinetics of mkp- <dig> transcription were determined by qpcr. there was a significant induction of mkp- <dig> mrna, which peaked as early as  <dig> hour upon lps stimulation, and the levels gradually decreased over a course of  <dig> hours. these results showed that lps induced mkp- <dig> expression .

bcg induces mkp- <dig> expression
next, to demonstrate the induction of specific phosphatases by bcg, kinetics of mkp- <dig> expression in pbmo was studied by using qpcr during bcg treatment. similar to the results produced by lps, upon the addition of bcg , there was a significant induction of mkp- <dig> mrna within  <dig> hour of bcg treatment as determined by taqman probe specific for mkp- <dig> . the effects lasted for at least  <dig> hours .

to examine whether the changes of protein production were in parallel to that of the mrna levels, the protein levels of mkp- <dig> were measured by western blotting. in response to bcg, pbmo produced the mkp- <dig> protein as early as  <dig> minutes after treatment. the protein levels were maintained for  <dig> hours and dropped to basal levels at  <dig> hours . the results demonstrated that there was mkp- <dig> induction in response to bcg activation in human monocytes.

bcg-induced mkp- <dig> expression is dependent on p <dig> mapk and erk1/2
it has been shown that inhibition of p <dig> mapk either by specific inhibitor or sirna reduced the expression of mkp- <dig> in lps- or peptidoglycan-treated macrophages  <cit> . to determine the mechanisms involved in the bcg-induced mkp- <dig> expression, pbmo were pretreated with several inhibitors including pd <dig> , sb <dig> , sp <dig> , and cape  for  <dig> hour. a range of concentrations of each inhibitor was used to test their optimal concentrations and effects on cell viability and kinase inhibitions. bcg was added afterwards and total rna was harvested. the results demonstrated that, with the inhibition of erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk activities by their corresponding relatively specific inhibitors, mkp- <dig> expressions were significantly reduced . in addition, using higher dose of sb <dig>  we showed that the inhibition is increased further . on the contrary, pretreatment of the cells with cape and sp <dig> did not affect the induction of mkp- <dig> by bcg . these results suggest that bcg-induced mkp- <dig> expression is dependent on both p <dig> mapk and erk1/ <dig> 

transfection of mkp- <dig> sirna into pbmo can reduce bcg-induced mkp- <dig> production
throughout the above experiments, the primary goal was to examine the induction of mkp- <dig> by bcg in human monocytes. thus, to further examine the role of mkp- <dig> in bcg-induced signaling, transfection of sirna into pbmo was used to knockdown the activity of mkp- <dig>  to demonstrate that the mkp- <dig> sirna can indeed knockdown the target gene, pbmo were first transfected with control or mkp- <dig> sirna and then treated with bcg for  <dig> hours. levels of mkp- <dig> mrna were measured by rt-pcr method. in figure 4a, bcg stimulated mkp- <dig> expression . in mkp- <dig> sirna transfected monocytes, induction of mkp- <dig> by bcg was significantly decreased . the results showed that the sirna does abrogate the levels of mkp- <dig> mrna.

to further determine whether mkp- <dig> sirna affects bcg-induced mkp- <dig> at protein levels, pbmo were treated as above and mkp- <dig> proteins were measured by western blotting. the results showed that bcg could induce mkp- <dig> proteins as usual for cells transfected with control sirna . however, the levels of bcg-induced mkp- <dig> protein expression were reduced in cells transfected with mkp- <dig> sirna . together, the results suggest that mkp- <dig> sirna not only reduced the mkp- <dig> mrna in bcg treatment but also abrogated the bcg-induced mkp- <dig> protein.

lps-induced cytokine expression is increased by mkp- <dig> sirna
as stated in the literature  <cit> , mkp- <dig> ko mice showed increased tnf-α production in response to lps. on the basis of the above mkp- <dig> sirna results, lps was then used as a control to demonstrate the effects of this mkp- <dig> sirna system.

pbmo were first transfected with control or mkp- <dig> sirna for  <dig> hours and then stimulated with lps for the indicated time periods. likewise, lps induced mkp- <dig> within  <dig> hour treatment and the effects lasted for at least  <dig> hours . the use of mkp- <dig> sirna can reduce the levels of mkp- <dig> mrna induced by lps . on the contrary, tnf-α levels were increased in mkp- <dig> sirna transfected monocytes upon challenge with lps . the increases in cytokine expression induced by lps in mkp- <dig> sirna transfected cells suggest that the sirna system is effective in knocking down the mkp- <dig> expression and mkp- <dig> acts as a negative regulator in lps-induced tnf-α expression.

bcg-induced cytokine expression is decreased by mkp- <dig> sirna
to investigate the effect of mkp- <dig> sirna on bcg-induced cytokine expression, the levels of tnf-α, il- <dig> and il- <dig> mrna were measured by qpcr method. pbmo were transfected with either control or mkp- <dig> sirna. following exposure to bcg with control sirna, there were significant inductions of tnf-α, il- <dig> and il- <dig> mrna levels for  <dig> hours after treatment as previously reported . next, the effects of mkp- <dig> sirna were examined on the cytokine expression induced by bcg. surprisingly, there was a significant abrogation of bcg-induced tnf-α expression by mkp- <dig> sirna . with the knockdown of mkp- <dig>  the level of bcg-induced tnf-α was only 60% compared to that of the control cells, while bcg-induced il- <dig> and il- <dig> were unchanged in mkp- <dig> sirna transfected cells. the results revealed that mkp- <dig> plays a role in the induction of tnf-α expression upon bcg stimulation, which may be different from that of its conventional functions in which mkp- <dig> acts as a negative regulator in lps-induced signaling pathways  <cit> .

bcg-induced mapk phosphorylation is decreased by mkp- <dig> sirna
the unexpected observations in cytokine expression lead to the investigation on the effects of mkp- <dig> sirna on bcg-induced mapk activation. mkp- <dig> was found to have a preferential substrate binding to p <dig> mapk and jnk than erk1/ <dig>  <cit> . the phosphorylation status of mapks was assessed in control or mkp- <dig> sirna transfected pbmo. western blotting results demonstrated that bcg-induced both p <dig> mapk and erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation in  <dig> minutes  and peaked at  <dig> minutes, and then returned to basal levels in cells treated with the control sirna . similar to the results of cytokine expression, phosphorylation of both p <dig> mapk and erk1/ <dig> in response to bcg was decreased in monocytes transfected with mkp- <dig> sirna instead of the expected increase in phosphorylation . the results suggest that mkp- <dig> knockdown would result in reduced mapk phosphorylation by bcg, implying that the reduced level of tnf-α production in bcg stimulated monocytes is due to reduced phosphorylation of mapks by mkp- <dig> sirna.

discussion
this report presented evidences that a novel function of mkp- <dig> is uncovered in cytokine regulation in response to mycobacterial infection. bcg induces mkp- <dig> as a rapid response . the induction mechanism of mkp- <dig> by bcg is dependent on both erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk . using sirna approach, the functions of mkp- <dig> can be examined in primary human monocytes. the results showed that the bcg-induced mapks activation as well as cytokine expression are downstream of mkp- <dig> . thus, mkp- <dig> is a critical signaling molecule that is involved in bcg-induced cytokine expression.

previous reports have shown that mkp- <dig> induced by lps or peptidoglycan is dependent on p <dig> mapk  <cit> . accordingly, bcg-induced mkp- <dig> can be inhibited by both p <dig> mapk and erk1/ <dig> inhibitors. interestingly, it has been shown that degradation of mkp- <dig> is reduced after erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> . it can be hypothesized that bcg-induced mkp- <dig> proteins can be stabilized by erk1/ <dig> and the detailed mechanisms involved require more exploration. also, since the inhibition of mkp- <dig> expression by both inhibitors  was not complete, it is believed that other proteins may be involved in the bcg-induced mkp- <dig> expression.

on the basis of the literature results on lps effects , the original expectation for this project is that mkp- <dig> acts as a negative regulator. lps-stimulated mkp- <dig> ko peritoneal macrophages showed prolonged phosphorylation of p <dig> mapk and jnk as well as increased production of tnf-α  <cit> . in doing so, lps-induced mkp- <dig> could prevent prolonged tnf-α production as in sepsis which may lead to severe damage to the host. it was expected that bcg induces mkp- <dig> and its induction would correlate with the dephosphorylation of mapks including p <dig> mapk. by blocking the mkp- <dig> using sirna, it was expected to have increased p <dig> mapk phosphorylation and prolonged tnf-α production in response to bcg. nevertheless, our results shown here are diametrically opposite. one possibility for the unexpected results may be due to non-specific effects of transfection or sirna. however, this was not the case since there was a prolonged and increased tnf-α expression after the mkp- <dig> sirna-transfected monocytes were treated with lps .

there is now a new hypothesis to explain such paradoxical effects of mkp- <dig> in tnf-α regulation in which the phosphatase plays a role in positive regulation of tnf-α production in response to bcg as in the case of dusp <dig>  <cit> . the structures of mkp- <dig> and dusp <dig> are similar, with which they both contain a mapk-interacting domain and a phosphatase catalytic site. by contrast, other dusp may have extra domains, e.g., pest  <cit> . here, we postulate that the function of mkp- <dig> in bcg-induced signaling is similar to that of the dusp2/pac <dig> 

actually, the discovery of dusp <dig> has initially created some paradoxical questions. as described, dusp <dig> behaves differently from other mkp family members  <cit> . in dusp <dig> ko macrophages treated with lps, they produced less inflammatory mediators including less tnf, il- <dig>  nitric oxide, and il-12-producing cells, when compared to that of the wild type counterparts  <cit> . indeed, the results of these published studies on dusp <dig> studies are quite similar to that of our reported results here.

it is plausible that these unexpected positive regulations of immune cell functions by dusp <dig> were due to crosstalks between mapks  <cit> . it was shown that there are interactions between jnk and erk1/ <dig> pathways  <cit> . here, we showed that the sustained activation of jnk blocks erk activation . in the dusp <dig> situation, stimulation of ko mast cells and macrophages shows increased phosphorylation of jnk, and inhibition of jnk by its own specific inhibitor restores phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig>  <cit> .

in the bcg-mkp- <dig> situation, there is an early phosphorylation of p <dig> mapk and erk1/ <dig>  therefore, it is possible that jnk may play a role in the crosstalk interaction of mapk. however, our preliminary data suggest that the level of phosphorylated jnk was not increased in pbmo transfected with mkp- <dig> sirna . thus, the details of the crosstalk between mapks need further investigation. here, we present a model to summarize the results and to hypothesize the existence of an as yet unidentified intermediary factor or factors in the pathways downstream of mkp- <dig> effects in the bcg-induced signaling cascade. the unexpected antimycobacterial role of mkp- <dig>  may be explained by events similar to the dusp <dig> effects. in this case, bcg induces mkp- <dig> expression while also activates mapks including p <dig> mapk and erk1/ <dig>  downstream of mkp- <dig>  there is an inhibition of unknown pathways or kinases. the unknown factor in turn inhibits mapks activation, which ultimately leads to more tnf-α induction .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, mkp- <dig> plays a critical role in the regulation of cytokine expression upon mycobacterial infection. inhibition of unknown pathways or kinases downstream of mkp- <dig>  which in turn inhibits mapks activation, may be used to explain the novel function of mkp- <dig> in enhancing mapk activity and consequent tnf-α expression following bcg treatment . taken together, the role of mapk crosstalks need further exploration.
