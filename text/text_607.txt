BACKGROUND
t cell receptors  display remarkable versatility in their ability to specifically recognize a wide array of structurally and chemically diverse antigens. this is highlighted by a number of studies showing that, in addition to well-characterized recognition of peptide-major histocompatibility complex   <cit> , many tcrs engage mhc-like molecules cd <dig>  which present a variety of lipid antigens  <cit> , and mr <dig>  which presents vitamin b metabolites  <cit> . at the sequence level, these tcrs can be restricted or diverse in their germ-line chain usage, depending in part on the t cell type, antigen, and antigen-presenting molecule  <cit> .

the understanding of the molecular basis of tcr interactions with cd <dig> and mr <dig> has been greatly advanced by a number of crystallographic studies that have elucidated the interface sites, key contacts, and binding modes of several of these complexes. this includes type i and type ii natural killer t cell  tcr interactions with cd1d-lipid , mucosal-associated invariant t cell  tcr interfaces with unliganded  <cit>  and ligand-bound mr <dig>  <cit> , and recent studies of two γδ tcrs bound to cd1d-lipid  <cit> . while these have provided a clear view of the antigen recognition underlying several of the invariant and diverse t cell subsets, owing to their variety and the effort required in experimental structure determination, the crystal structures of a number of key complexes have not yet been solved.

here we describe the adaptation of the tcr docking algorithm, tcrflexdock, previously shown to produce highly accurate tcr-pmhc structural predictions  <cit> , to predict complexes of tcrs with cd <dig> and mr <dig> with antigen . we assessed unbound docking performance using four known structures of tcrs with cd1d, showing that for most cases accurate models were produced. we also predicted the complex between a mait tcr and mr1-ag, an interaction that has not yet been structurally described, and assessing models against a related mait tcr bound to mr1-ag, found strong agreement between predicted complex and the likely conserved binding mode. applying tcrflexdock to predict the structure of two germline-encoded, mycolyl lipid-reactive  tcrs bound to cd1b, we produced models that provide insight into both their shared sequence features and distinct antigen specificities.

RESULTS
prediction of tcr-cd1d and tcr-mr <dig> complexes
searching for existing unbound and bound tcr and mhc-like protein structures in the protein data bank   <cit> , we identified four tcr-cd1d-ag test cases  representing various classes of tcrs . additional complexes of the same class with essentially identical docking orientations  were not included. we also identified a case with an unbound mait tcr  that binds mr <dig> presenting the antigen 6fp , with a nearly identical sequence to the α chain from a structure of another mait tcr  bound to mr1-6-fp ; two residues are substituted near the n-term of the cdr3α loop. given the likely “common mode of mait tcr-mr <dig> docking”  <cit> , supported by additional mait tcr complexes with bovine mr <dig> and trbv <dig> tcr variants  <cit> , we evaluated docking predictions of the unbound trbv <dig> mait tcr to mr1-6fp using the conserved α chain and mr <dig> in the bound structure, to determine whether the α chain binding conformation is recapitulated by docking, and to predict how the distinctive trbv <dig> chain engages mr1-ag. collectively, these tcr-cd1d-ag and tcr-mr1-ag structures represent a wide variety of docking modes , with greater variability than the tcr-pmhc complexes we considered in our previous work  <cit> .table  <dig>

we performed flexible protein docking using tcrflexdock to predict the complexes in table  <dig> using the unbound tcr and cd1d-ag/mr1-ag structures; results are shown in table  <dig>  with test cases represented by their complex pdb ids from table  <dig>  scores versus interface root-mean-square distances  for cases with hits are shown in figure  <dig>  we assessed models using capri criteria  <cit> , classifying them as incorrect, acceptable, medium accuracy, or high accuracy, and defined hits, as in our previous study of tcr-pmhc docking  <cit> , as those with medium or high accuracy. for two out of the four cd1d test cases in table  <dig> , hits were identified in the top  <dig> predictions, ranked as in our previous work by zrank  <dig> . for test case 4mng , relatively few hit predictions were generated, and these were not well-ranked . despite its rigid-body classification due to minimal binding conformational changes, this case was challenging due to its atypical docking orientation featuring only the δ tcr chain contacting cd1d-sulfatide  <cit> , resulting in a significant distance from the docking start position as well as a smaller interface area which is unfavorable for the docking scoring function. however, near-hits  were highly ranked for this case, with a top rank of  <dig>  for test case 3huj, no hits were found among the  <dig> tcrflexdock models, which was likely due to its outlier binding mode and distance from the starting docking orientation . performance in this case was improved by employing alternative docking start sites closer to its bound orientation, as noted below.table  <dig>

for the mait tcr-mr1-6fp case, the predictions were remarkably consistent with a conserved mait tcr α chain binding conformation, with the top-ranked model involving the trbv <dig> tcr classified a hit with respect to the bound crystal structure with the trbv <dig> tcr, and the third-ranked model having the lowest rmsd  from the bound structure among all docking models. this model, shown in figure  <dig>  exhibits nearly perfect matches with tcrα backbone and key side chains in the crystal structure . in contrast, the modeled trbv <dig> and crystal structure trbv <dig> chains differ somewhat in cdr loop structure and overall orientation. this is consistent with cdr3β swapping experiments between the trbv <dig> and trbv <dig> mait tcrs considered here that ablated mr1-ag binding, which implied a trbv germline context dependence for cdr3β loops   <cit> . furthermore there are relatively few favorable side chain contacts between modeled trbv <dig> β chain and mr <dig>  in agreement with alanine scanning mutagenesis data  <cit>  that found no individual β chain cdr mutants of this mait tcr that significantly altered mr <dig> recognition.figure  <dig>

to investigate whether the tcr cdr loop backbone structure had a significant relationship with overall docking accuracy for these cases, we compared rmsd for modeled versus bound tcr residue backbone atoms  with rigid-body ligand rmsd for the  <dig> docking models of two test cases . surprisingly, there was little relationship between these values, indicating that although a bound-like tcr backbone will improve the hit rate of the docking simulation as we previously noted  <cit> , the sampling of cdr loop conformations during docking includes bound-like conformations for both hits and non-hits, and a near-native docking position  does not necessarily lead to accurately-modeled cdr loops.

retraining the tcrflexdock scoring function
we re-trained the zrank scoring function using the previously reported set of tcr-pmhc test cases and docking results  <cit>  to determine whether such an optimized function would improve success on the tcr-cd <dig> and tcr-mr <dig> cases in table  <dig>  the re-weighted function we derived  indeed led to improved predictive performance in table 2; though the first hit for case 4mng was still ranked relatively low, its rank improved , while the near-hit was ranked  <dig> by zrt . the new tcr-pmhc derived weights had a lower van der waals attractive weight relative to the other terms compared with the previous zrank function  <cit> , likely due to the lower shape complementarity of tcr-pmhc interactions versus protein-protein interfaces in general  <cit> . the top-ranked zrt prediction for test case 4ei <dig> had a  <dig>  Å interface rmsd from native; its structure is shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  despite some deviations of the sulfatide antigen head group and cdr3β with respect to the complex crystal structure, the xv <dig> tcr variable domains as a whole, as well as several key interface side chains, are positioned similarly to those of the known complex.

utilizing alternate docking start sites
considering the distinct binding orientation of the type i nkt tcr test case 3huj , we initialized separate docking simulations, in addition to the original “start1” docking start site, from two alternative sites closer to the bound orientation to determine whether they would lead to tcrflexdock hits. we employed a “start2” site that was approximately equidistant from the 3huj and 4mng bound orientations, with a 20 Å translational shift along the cd1d helices from “start1” , as well as a “fit” site that entailed root-mean-square fitting the unbound tcr to the bound tcr position . despite substantial distance from the bound orientation , docking from the start <dig> site led to highly ranked hits using both zr <dig> and zrt scoring functions for 3huj , though some non-hits from start <dig> docking ranked higher than these hits . hits were not improved for test case 4mng, indicating as noted above that the interface characteristics rather than the docking orientation alone likely caused the docking search to yield few favorable hits. as expected from their relatively large distances to the bound conformation , for the remaining three cases the start <dig> docking start site led to no hits . when pooling results from start <dig> and start <dig> sites however, the near-native predictions were predominantly scored better by zrt for all these cases . for one test case  we also tested pooling results from two additional start sites , and zrt continued to rank the near-native models best .figure  <dig>

prediction of tcr complexes with cd1b-gmm and cd1b-ma
recently the unbound crystal structures of two clones of germline mycolyl-lipid reactive  αβ tcrs were reported  <cit> : clone  <dig> , which binds cd1b-ma, and clone  <dig>  which binds cd1b-gmm. as the complex structures have not been reported, and the structure of cd1b-gmm was reported in a previous study  <cit> , we used tcrflexdock to predict these two structures representing this class of interactions. as the α chains are nearly identical between the two gem tcr clones and likely dominate the interactions with cd1b-ag  <cit> , we computed the distances between the models ranked in the top  <dig> by zrt for the two tcrs based on the rmsds between their germline cdrα loop positions . we found that the 4g8e and 4g8f models  were highly similar to each other, with many of the top  <dig> models less than 4 Å apart. 4g8e model  <dig> and 4g8f model  <dig> exhibited the highest similarity in germ line cdrα positioning  over cd1b-ag, and fell into the largest cluster of models in both sets of top  <dig> predictions . on this basis, as well as notable contacts with antigen as described below, we selected these models for further analysis.

the structures of these models  provide a view of their overall recognition mode as well as several differences in tcr contacts mediating differential antigen recognition. gem tcr engagement of cd1b is similar to characterized structures of αβ tcr recognition of pmhcs, including the murine yae <dig> tcr bound to h- <dig> kb and peptide . closer examination of the modeled interfaces shows key roles for certain tcr residues in mediating antigen recognition, for instance tyr31β is positioned close to the antigen in both complexes. arg107β of the 4g8e tcr is of particular interest, due to its potential electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged head group of the ma antigen ; this residue was also highlighted based on the unbound clone  <dig> structure as it represented a notable difference between the two clones’ cdr <dig> architectures  <cit> . while these models provide a likely mechanism of cd1b-ag engagement, other sets of 4g8e and 4g8f models were identified that shared docking orientations with tcr-pmhc and mait-mr1-ag interfaces .figure  <dig>

discussion
we have demonstrated that our tcr docking algorithm, tcrflexdock, is capable of producing accurate models of tcrs recognizing mhc-like molecules presenting a variety of non-peptide ligands. by retraining our scoring function, we were able to improve the re-ranking performance for test cases representing this class of complexes. further improvements, for instance to improve the ranking of hits for the 4mng or 3huj cases and performance using pooled results from alternate docking start sites, could potentially be achieved through inclusion of other terms , and further optimization of the pair potential parameters and antigen atom typing. additionally, though antigen bond torsion angles were minimized during rosetta docking simulations, explicit inclusion of lipid head group rotamers  could represent another route for improving docking performance.

we report models of cd1b-bound gem tcrs from tcrflexdock that account for a likely shared docking orientation as well fine differences in antigen recognition. the docking searches for these cases were focused on the cd1b site analogous to the pmhc interface engaged by most tcrs; while outlier tcr binding modes have been observed for some non-mhc ligands  <cit>  and would reduce change of docking success , mutagenesis evidence strongly suggests that tcrs engage cd1b-ag with a footprint similar to tcr-pmhc interactions  <cit> . two previously reported tcr-cd1b-ag modeling attempts  were based on homology with tcr-pmhc complex structures  <cit> , rather than a flexible docking search; notably, in one of these studies the tcr loops exhibited considerable clash with antigen in the modeled complexes  <cit> , a challenge that is explicitly addressed during the conformational search of tcrflexdock. within our set of tcr-cd1b-ag models, the dominant cluster was similar to the class i mhc-bound yae <dig> tcr . however, we did identify alternative models, including several that were similar to the trbv <dig> mait tcr-mr1-ag and els <dig> tcr-hla-peptide complexes. as noted by others  <cit> , the mait, els <dig> and gem tcrs share trav1- <dig> genes and the former two exhibit similar docking orientations over their respective ligands  <cit> , yet given the structural and residue-level differences between cd1b, mr <dig> and mhc, there is a significant possibility that tcr-cd1b-ag interactions exhibit a distinct binding conformation, as we identified using tcrflexdock. experimental structural characterization of gem tcr-cd1b-ag complexes will allow determination of which models are most accurate.

while this manuscript was under review, the x-ray structure of a trbv20-containing mait tcr  in complex with mr <dig> and antigen was reported  <cit> . though the antigens of our docking simulation and the solved structure are not identical , we evaluated interface backbone rmsd between our models and the solved structure , and the top-ranked model by zrt score indeed had a low interface rmsd with respect to the experimentally determined complex structure .

CONCLUSIONS
these updates to the tcrflexdock algorithm, as well as the docking test cases we assembled, represent an advance in modeling tcr-ligand recognition, extending capabilities beyond tcr-pmhc modeling methods reported by ourselves  <cit>  and others  <cit>  to modeling complexes with lipid and metabolite antigens presented by mhc-like molecules. our models of mait tcr-mr1-ag and gem tcr-cd1b-ag complexes, which have not been described crystallographically, provide likely mechanisms of ligand engagement by these tcrs, and highlight the ability of advanced protein docking algorithms to complement experimental techniques in probing the structural basis of molecular recognition. these methods can be applied to model other tcrs bound to mhc-like ligands, as more of these interactions and tcrs become characterized, such as a γδ tcr clone that was recently found to engage the endothelial protein c receptor  <cit> .
