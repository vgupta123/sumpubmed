BACKGROUND
the genome of wild-type and laboratory strains of saccharomyces cerevisiae  has significant genetic variability. in general, natural isolates are often polyploid or aneuploid and have high degree of genetic variability and an essentially asexual life cycle  <cit> . indeed, environmental perturbation often selects strains that display local gene amplifications, changes in chromosome copy number or gross chromosomal rearrangements, such as intra- or inter-chromosomal translocations, mediated by transposon-related sequences  <cit> .

recent comparative genomics studies showed that wild-type yeast strains cluster according to technological application rather than geographical distribution  <cit> . however, the species as a whole is not domesticated and consists of both wild-type and comercial populations. for example, specialized sake and wine strains were derived from natural populations not associated with alcoholic beverages, rather than the opposite  <cit> . also, yeast strains are found in diverse habitats, namely in oak exudates  <cit> , gut of insects  <cit> , plant leaves and in grape berries  <cit> . interestingly, damaged grape barriers, but not undamaged berries, are an important source of yeast strains  <cit> . the diversity of yeast strains in viticultural regions is rather high, suggesting the occurrence of specific natural strains associated with particular terroirs  <cit> .

simple sequence repeat  analysis, used to determine phylogenetic relationships between  <dig> yeast strains isolated from  <dig> worldwide geographical origins  <cit> , showed that macro geographical differentiation of strains from asia, europe and africa accounted for only 28% of the observed genetic variation, suggesting clonal reproduction and local domestication. the close association between vine migration and wine yeast favors the hypothesis that yeast may have followed man and vine as a commensal member of grapevine micro flora. ssrs were also used to distinguish populations from vineyards in close geographical locations and showed that genetic differences among yeast populations were apparent from gradations in allele frequencies rather than from distinctive "diagnostic" genotypes  <cit> .

the continuous utilization of yeast strains for industrial purposes introduced artificial selective pressure that may have also influenced genome features and novel specialization routes. in fact, yeast has been identified as an emerging human pathogen that can cause clinically relevant infections in immune compromised patients  <cit> . such pathogenic strains are phylogenetically related to baking strains, grow at higher temperature, produce extracellular proteases, are capable of pseudohyphal growth and may be resistant to antifungal treatment  <cit> . also, the genome of the pathogenic s. cerevisiae strain yjm <dig> has very high percentage of sequence polymorphisms , which may be a primary cause of phenotypic variation  <cit> .

the wide ecological, geographical, clinical and industrial distribution of yeast strains and the genome diversity already uncovered suggests that it is a good model system to understand genome diversity in natural populations and elucidate the relevance of such diversity for adaptation to changing environments and to new ecological niches. one of the first comprehensive studies on genetic variation of yeast strains, carried out using high-density oligonucleotide arrays containing up to  <dig>  oligonucleotide probes from the yeast genomic sequence, unveiled differences at the level of single nucleotide polymorphisms and gene copy number alterations  <cit> . a similar approach revealed unexpected differences in  <dig> genes between the s288c and cen.pk113-7d laboratory strains, involving differential gene amplification, gene absence or sequence polymorphisms  <cit> .

in order to shed new light on the genome diversity of natural populations of yeast, we have isolated more than  <dig> strains, genotyped them and identified clusters that distinguished the various genotypes. we then selected representatives of these clusters and compared their genomes with the genomes of clinical and commercial strains. for this, we used spotted dna microarrays containing probes for the complete gene set of the s288c reference strain. we compared the genomes of five commercial winemaking strains, eight strains isolated from winemaking environments of two wine producing regions in portugal, namely the bairrada and vinho verde appellations of origin, and three clinical strains. the laboratorial strain s288c was used as reference for relative genome profiling. our results highlighted differences between the laboratorial strain and the wild-type isolates linked to sub-telomeric instability and retrotransposon activity. these elements shaped differently the genomes of yeast strains from wine and clinical environments. the study also identified functional classes of genes where the copy number variations were associated with strains from wine- or clinical-related environments. no correlation was found between geographical origin and relative genome profile in the larger group of wine-related strains.

RESULTS
strains and overview of genomic variability
a total of  <dig> wild-type strains plus the reference s288c strain were used in this study . the wine strains were selected amongst isolates of wine cellars and vineyards of bairrada and vinho verde wine regions, in portugal. strains um <dig> and um <dig> were selected among  <dig> strains isolated from the vinho verde region  <cit>  for their distinctive genetic  and enzymatic  profiles. strains from the bairrada region were selected from  <dig> isolates collected during two consecutive years of grape harvest and wine production and represented major strain clusters of inter-delta region pcr genotyping profiles  . commercial yeast strains used in industrial wine must fermentations were lalvin ec- <dig>  used in the vinho verde region, and lalvin icv d <dig>  ioc 18– <dig>  aeb fermol rouge and davis lalvin  <dig>  commonly used in the bairrada region. these commercial strains were initially selected from french wine producing regions  and are used world-wide. finally, three strains, isolated from patients suffering from opportunistic fungal infections were also included in this study. these strains were selected from a clinical strain collection on the basis of their inter-delta genotyping profiles . the inter-delta profiles of j <dig> and j <dig> were very similar and these strains were used to ascertain how the inter-delta region relatedness, used to genotype the strain collection, correlated with the genomic variability.

since natural hybridization between species of the saccharomyces sensu stricto group can occur  <cit>  and, indeed, several s. cerevisiae × s. kudriavzevii, s. bayanus × s. cerevisiae and s. bayanus × s. cerevisiae × s. kudriavzevii, have been described among wine strains  <cit> , all strains were tested for their hybrid nature. for this, met <dig> locus restriction fragment analysis was used. s. cerevisiae-specific profiles identical to those of the reference strain s288c were detected in all cases, suggesting that the strains selected for acgh analysis were authentic s. cerevisiae. these results were corroborated by an additional analysis of  <dig> polymorphic s. cerevisiae-specific simple sequence repeats . finally, pcr-rflp profiling of the opy <dig>  kin <dig>  met <dig>  kel <dig> and cyr <dig> loci, which are located on chromosomes ii, iii, v, vii and x, respectively, confirmed the above data, thus unequivocally demonstrating that the strains used had a s. cerevisiae-specific profile and were not hybrids .

for acgh analysis, genomic dna from each strain was fluorescently labeled and competitively hybridized with genomic dna from the reference strain s288c, with duplicate experiments in reverse cy-dye labeling  design .

hierarchical cluster analysis of the acgh data showed high genome variability , and the laboratory strain s288c was clearly differentiated from the other  <dig> strains. clinical strains  were clearly differentiated from the wine strains clusters . high similarity between the genomes of two of the clinical strains, j <dig> and j <dig> was expected from their identical inter-delta region profiles  and microsatellite patterns , and such genome similarity was confirmed by acgh profile similarity . other pairs of strains with distinct inter-delta region profiles showed the high similarity in the clustering tree, namely, aeb fermol rouge and 06l1ff <dig>  davis lalvin  <dig> and 06l6ff <dig> or um <dig> and um <dig> 

environmental and commercial wine strains formed three clusters  and differences between them were as high as those observed between wine and clinical strains. divergence among wine yeast was not correlated to geographical origin, since strains bb <dig> and 06l6ff <dig>  were more similar to strains um <dig> and um <dig>  than to strains bb <dig>  06l3ff <dig> and 06l1ff <dig> . furthermore, commercial strains isolated from french winemaking regions grouped together with strains from the bairrada and vinho verde regions. there was also no separation of strains isolated from vineyards , from cellars  or from commercial strains .

genome variability is associated with ty elements and telomeres
yeast genomes evolve through dynamic processes and often contain gene duplications and deletions or even chromosomal segment rearrangements. genome instability occurs throughout the genome, but is more frequent in particular regions, such as near ty elements, due to reciprocal translocations, or at sub-telomeric regions, possibly caused by high-frequency of ectopic recombination  <cit> . to investigate the presence of regions of increased genome variability we used the "cluster along chromosomes"  method of the cgh miner software package  <cit> . this software highlighted the occurrence of clusters of altered data in a set of samples relatively to controls, using a moving data window to calculate an average log ratio value, while controlling the false discovery rate , according to user defined parameters. karyoscope maps that indicated the location of regions with alterations in orf copy number  for each strain were obtained using cgh miner analysis as previously described by dunn and colleagues  <cit> , with the chromosomal coordinates of s288c genome. since some acgh probes interrogated duplicated or multicopy orfs, namely orfs of ty elements, those karyoscope maps display the average dosage of the repeated orfs rather than the dosage of each of the repeated orfs. a moving window of three orfs was chosen as the lowest statistically meaningful interval for averaging the hybridization signal, thus defining the resolution of the analysis.

the karyoscope maps displaying the relative hybridization data derived for each strain revealed that the majority of the genome alterations corresponded to deletions relative to strain s288c, while orf amplifications were rare . orf amplification clusters were found in some strains, mostly located in sub-telomeric regions  and within  <dig> kb of the s288c respective chromosome end, but only few corresponded to genes with annotated function. clusters of depleted orfs were found in sub-telomeric regions and contained large percentage of ty elements and hypothetical orfs . in the group of wine strains, up to one third of the observed gene copy number alterations were found in sub-telomeric regions  – within  <dig> kb from the s288c chromosome ends, using the criterion of edwards-ingram and colleagues  <cit> . on average, the clinical strains showed slightly higher percentage  of depleted orfs localized near the telomeres. however, this is mostly explained by the massive loss of chromosomes vii and x right arms in strains j <dig> and j <dig> . the depletion of orfs around the centromeric regions- within  <dig> kb of the centromere, according to the criterion of schacherer and colleagues  <cit> - was reduced and only slightly above average in some of the wine strains.

a clear differentiation between clinical and wine related strains was observed when the frequency of transposable elements within the orfs with depleted copy number  was considered. ty elements comprised 36% of the orfs absent in all wine strains, which meant that approximately one third of the orfs associated with retrotransposon activity  in s288c were absent in these strains. the genomes of the clinical strains, however, contained most of the ty elements identified in the genomic sequence of s288c, since only 7% of the orfs absent in all three of them were classified in this category.

highly variable genomic regions in wine and clinical strains
the differences between wine and clinical strains were further highlighted with the consensus plots obtained from the intersection of the individual karyoscope maps of the thirteen wine fermentation strains , compared to the three clinical isolates . these plots represented the relative amount of samples with copy number alterations, showing the percentage of strains with a given amplification or deletion. most of the deletion clusters identified in wine strains co-localized with absent ty elements , while in clinical isolates a significant number of depletions were associated with sub-telomeric instability . variable regions affected different sub-functional categories of genes in wine and clinical strains. for example, carbohydrate transporters and glycosidases were the main functional groups of genes absent in clinical strains, but genes involved in vesicle transport, telomere maintenance and alcohol metabolism were also identified among the lost sub-telomeric genes. the functional categories most affected by gene copy number variability in wine strains were related to vitamin metabolism, dna recombination, polysaccharide metabolism, regulation of meiotic cell cycle and reproduction, and were frequently located in the vicinity of ty element insertion sites.

asp <dig> and yrf <dig> gene families differentiate wild-type and laboratory strains
the karyoscope maps constructed by the moving average window algorithm  highlighted genes with copy number alterations. of the  <dig> orfs identified as altered by the clac algorithm, in at least one of the strains, significance analysis confirmed  <dig> orf alterations. from these, 30% corresponded to ty elements, mostly located in depleted hybridization clusters in wine strains . another third of orfs with copy number variation were hypothetical orfs and were contiguous to deleted ty elements in wine strains. annotated variable orfs constituted the remaining third of significantly altered orfs and the respective acgh values  were depicted in figure 6a for further discussion.

general trends in copy number alterations included both amplified and depleted genes. genes with the same trend in copy number alteration across all strains were highlighted in grey. among the genes depleted in all strains, relative to the reference strain s288c, were four copies of tandemly-repeated cell-wall asparaginase genes , which are induced in response to nitrogen starvation  <cit> . also, orfs ylr161w, ylr156w and ylr159w, that code for putative proteins of unknown function and of identical sequence, were depleted in all strains. these genes are located in the right arm of chromosome xii near a ribosomal dna region, in a chromosome locus corresponding to a large cluster of depleted orfs flanking ty elements, and were indicated in the karyoscope consensus maps of both wine and clinical strains .

the relative hybridization values of significantly altered genes  identified another set of homologous genes whose copy number was altered in all wild-type strains. indeed, five genes of the yrf <dig> family, which are located in telomeric y' elements and encode dna helicases , were present in the genome of s288c, but were depleted or, at least, partially depleted in environmental, clinical and commercial strains. the missing yrf <dig> genes were part of the depleted orf clusters located at the telomeres of the right arms of chromosomes v, vii, xii and xv , together with several hypothetical orfs.

gene yil014c-a, coding for a putative protein of unknown function, was deleted in all strains except in j <dig>  the same was observed for the tandem repeated genes ena <dig> and ena <dig>  which code for a p-type atpase sodium pump involved in the efflux of sodium and lithium ions, required for salt tolerance, which were depleted in all strains except 06l3ff <dig>  gene ena <dig> was only depleted in strain j <dig> 

a group of genes with increased copy number in almost all strains was also identified . among them, imd <dig>  imd <dig>  pho <dig>  pho <dig> were signaled by the clac algorithm as belonging to clusters of sub-telomeric genes amplified in strains lalvin ec- <dig>  lalvin icv  <dig> and um <dig>  but acgh values suggested that they could also be amplified in other strains . pho <dig> and pho <dig> genes, which code for acid phosphatases and are induced by phosphate starvation, increased their copy number by a factor of  <dig> in strain um <dig> relative to s288c, while in strain lalvin ec- <dig> the fold increase in hybridization signal was more compatible with its duplication. the copy number of the imd <dig> gene increased by a factor of  <dig> in lalvin ec- <dig> and um <dig> strains, as well as in strain lalvin icv d <dig>  although the latter was not highlighted as duplicated by cgh-miner. in strain lalvin icv d <dig>  rds <dig>  was part of an amplified cluster of genes on chromosome iii and the acgh signal indicated a 3-fold increase relative to s288c. the acgh values for this gene  further suggested that it was also amplified in other strains .

interestingly, both imd <dig> and imd <dig> genes code for inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase and confer resistance to mycophenolic acid, which is produced by the fungus penicillium stoloniferum and inhibits de novo purine synthesis. these genes, together with rds <dig>  are involved in resistance to compounds that inhibit eukaryotic cell proliferation and increased copy numbers point to a survival advantage in competitive ecosystems in presence of organisms that secrete mycophenolic acid or cycloheximide, as growth inhibitors.

gene copy number alterations and the origin of strains
several genes showed different copy number alterations in wine and in clinical strains . for example, the genes hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and two orfs of hxt <dig>  were depleted in most wine strains, with the exception of um <dig>  lalvin ec- <dig> and aeb fermol rouge, but did not show copy number variation in the clinical strains . these genes code for putative hexose transporters which are non-functional in strain s288c. similar copy number changes across the analyzed strains were identified for hpf <dig> and fsp <dig>  which code for proteins with glucosidase activity: hpf <dig> codes for a haze-protective mannoprotein that reduces the particle size of aggregated proteins in white wines, while fsp <dig> is induced under nitrogen limitation. also, the gene enb <dig>  which codes for a trans-membrane iron transporter of the major facilitator superfamily and is expressed under iron deprivation conditions, was included in this group. the absence of these genes was particularly notorious in strains isolated from the bairrada region and in the commercial strain davis lalvin  <dig> .

the genes fdh <dig>  fit <dig>  fre <dig> and phr <dig> were absent in the clinical isolates j <dig> and j <dig> and in strain 06l3ff <dig>  fdh <dig> codes for a formate dehydrogenase, fit <dig> codes for a mannoprotein involved in the retention of siderophore-iron in the cell wall, fre <dig> codes for a putative ferric reductase induced by low iron levels, and phr codes for a dna photolyase induced by dna damage . these genes do not share a common function, but belong to a set of contiguous orfs located in the sub-telomeric region of the right arm of chromosome v, which was deleted in many of the strains . this cluster of deleted orfs included fit <dig>  which was also deleted in the above mentioned strains and in 06l1ff <dig>  but showed acgh values compatible with amplification of copy number in many of the natural wine strains and in j <dig>  although redundant, considering the existence of other functional homologues, variability in copy number of these genes may affect the capacity of yeast to thrive in environments with high levels of exogenous formaldehyde, produced from plant material or from degradation of environmental pollutants, and in environments with low iron availability.

a group of genes coding for proteins with alcohol dehydrogenase activity were missing in strains j <dig> and j <dig>  but were amplified in many of the wine strains . for example, adh <dig> and aad <dig>  which belong to a cluster of amplified orfs identified in chromosome iii in strain lalvin icv d <dig> by clac analysis , showed increased copy number in strains bb <dig> and davis lalvin  <dig>  aad <dig> and aad <dig> were depleted in strains j <dig> and j <dig>  since these genes code for proteins involved in ethanol tolerance, their increase in copy number may confer high resistance to ethanol, which is one of the most important phenotypes for grape must fermentation. rds <dig> was also included in this group of genes because of the similar copy number variation profile within the analyzed strains, probably due to its location in the same cluster of altered orfs as adh <dig> and aad <dig>  in chromosome iii.

a large set of genes were consistently deleted in the three clinical isolates . the cog <dig>  hsp <dig>  msp <dig>  nce <dig> genes  are implicated in protein transport and localization, while arr <dig> and dip <dig> are arsenite and amino acid transporters, respectively. these genes that were absent in clinical strains were amplified in some of the wine strains, namely 06l3ff <dig>  06l1ff <dig> and aeb fermol rouge. the relative abundance of these genes in the latter strains explained, at least in part, why their genome profiles differed from those of the other wine strains .

other genes were absent in clinical and in many wine strains . for example, genes involved in carbohydrate transport  and sugar metabolism  belonged to this category. strains lalvin ec- <dig> and ioc 18– <dig> were the only wine strains with a decreased copy number in agp <dig>  which codes for an amino acid permease, and dak <dig>  participating in the glycerol catabolic process, while strain 06l6ff <dig> constituted an exception within the wine strains, since it showed identical copy number of all of these genes relatively to strain s288c.

gene copy number signatures for wine must fermentation
many of the variable genes coded for transporters, permeases, or flocculation proteins, contributing to a genomic signature of the wine strains. among these genes, the maltose transporter gene, mal <dig>  and the mal-activator protein gene, mal <dig>  were particularly interesting because they are important for maltose assimilation and mal <dig> is non-functional in the laboratory s288c strain  <cit> . these genes were absent in the commercial wine strains and in some of the environmental isolates. also, only some of the commercial wine strains , showed acgh values compatible with copy number increase of cup1- <dig>  genes involved in flocculation mediated by cell wall protein-carbohydrate interactions, namely flo <dig>  flo <dig>  flo <dig> and flo <dig>  were in general depleted in the wine strains, and also in two of the clinical strains. evidences for variability in copy number of the homologous genes were found in almost all strains, with exception of lalvin icv d <dig>  where the acgh values indicated that these genes were deleted. finally, copy number variability among wine strains was also found in genes pau <dig>  pau <dig> and pau <dig> that code for hypothetical proteins with structural similarity to the seripauperin family.

discussion
acgh profiles grouped yeast strains from different geographical origins
the genome variability uncovered within the environmental, clinical and commercial strains was pronounced and did not show any correlation between genome characteristics and ecosystem or geographical origin. interestingly, this study unveiled high genomic similarity between the commercial strains and isolates from regions where these commercial strains were used in wine must fermentation. for instance, strains um <dig> and um <dig> from the vinho verde region share a similar genome hybridization profile  and grouped with strain lalvin ec- <dig> , which is frequently used in the production of sparkling vinho verde. strain ioc 18– <dig>  which is used in bottle-fermentations, is widely used in the bairrada sparkling wine production, and grouped with some of the bairrada isolates . close associations were also found between aeb fermol rouge and strains 06l1ff <dig>  06l3ff <dig>  and bb <dig>  from cellars and vineyards of the bairrada region, respectively . strains 06l6ff <dig>  06l3ff <dig> and bb <dig> are more related to davis lalvin  <dig> than to any other commercial strain. aeb fermol rouge, isolated in france, and davis lalvin  <dig>  obtained from the usa , are both used in the bairrada cellars to ferment wine musts due to their high fermentation performance with grapes from this region.

the continuous use of commercial yeast strains in large quantities and during successive years may lead to some genetic homogenization of resident strains that belong to the autochthonous yeast flora. this is supported by the fact that strain um <dig> was collected in  <dig>   <dig> meters from a winery where strain lalvin ec- <dig> was used in that year, whereas strain um <dig> was collected, in  <dig>   <dig> meters from a winery where the same commercial strain was used since  <dig>  <cit> . however, since the bairrada isolates come from cellars where no commercial strains were used, and the vineyards were not located in the vicinity of cellars , a contamination with commercial yeast does not explain the similarities between environmental isolates and some commercial strains. instead, the winemaker's experience for the production of wines with the most desirable expression of the region's terroir may, indirectly, be responsible for this genomic resemblance. by favoring phenotypic characteristics in the autochthonous strains, which adapted during centuries of positive selection by farming and wine producing activities, the wine producer may have selected commercial yeast according to the same required phenotypes, and this resemblance in phenotype is reflected, to some extent, in similar gene copy number characteristics.

large scale genome alterations
s. cerevisiae strains that were mainly obtained from winemaking environment, are homothallic, mostly homozygous , with low to high  sporulation ability and are predominantly diploid  <cit> . aneuploid strains have also been described  <cit> . although no evidence for polyploidy was detected in the strains analyzed in this study, the karyoscope maps of the clinical isolates j <dig> and j <dig>  showed a systematic depletion in hybridization signal throughout the entire length of chromosomes iii, vii and x. this depletion was only statistically significant at the right arm-ends, ruling out the hypothesis that these strains were aneuploid for the referred chromosomes. also, no evidence for aneuploidy was found in the other strains.

one explanation for the karyoscopes of strains j <dig> and j <dig> may be the presence of heterologous chromosomes originated from a different strain, albeit similar to s. cerevisiae s288c. the latter hypothesis is supported by the frequent occurrence of saccharomyces sp. hybrids, which originate from mating of different saccharomyces species that form viable, although sterile, zygotes  <cit> . these hybrids are sometimes selected for industrial beer or wine fermentations due to phenotypic advantages  <cit> , but inter-specific hybrids were also found in diverse spontaneous fermentations  <cit> . however, the strains used in our study, including the clinical isolates, were not hybrids . therefore, differences in chromosome copy number, that is, structural heteromorphisms, of chromosomes iii, vii and x, may be the explanation for the obtained patterns of relative hybridization.

specific trends of genome instability distinguished wine and clinical isolates
consensus maps highlighted the most variable regions of the yeast genome, relatively to the laboratory s288c strain. high variability was associated with the sub-telomeric regions of some chromosomes, irrespective of the strain's origin. in particular, a large fraction of strains, either from wine or clinical background, had orf deletions located at the right end of chromosome i, left end of chromosome vi, and right end of chromosomes vii and x . comparative genome studies performed by winzeler and colleagues  <cit>  showed that inter-species genome variability is biased toward sub-telomeric regions, where genes related to carbon source metabolism and transport are located. apparently, telomere variability is important for adaptation to new environments and to different metabolic sources to overcome environmental stress.

retrotransposons are also known as regions of high genome diversity between yeast strains and species  <cit> . our data further supports the hypothesis that they may be selected for generating genomic variability in response to environmental stimuli, since they were affected differently in wine and clinical strains . wine must fermentation isolates differed dramatically in ty element composition from the reference laboratorial strain, as indicated by the relative absence of about one third of these elements, together with orfs flanking their insertion sites. on the other hand, clinical strains were similar to s288c in composition of ty element and ty element associated orfs.

this raised the question of whether clinical strains and s288c share a common ancestor or whether the reduced number of ty elements and the flanking genes in the wine strains could result from selective pressures that affect particular regions of the genome in response to adaptation to particular environments. genome comparison between the clinical isolate yjm <dig> and s288c undertaken by wei and colleagues  <cit> , showed a close association between repeat sequences sites in s288c and deleted regions in yjm <dig> 

a comparison of the consensus plots of the strains used in this study with the sequences of the chromosomes of yjm <dig>  showed that the clusters of depleted orfs associated with ty elements in the former  were also missing in the yjm <dig> genome . on the other hand, the consensus plot obtained for the clinical strains coincided with the comparative analysis carried out by wei and colleagues  <cit> . in particular, in the sub-telomeric variability found in several chromosomes and in the clusters of deleted orfs associated with ty element insertion sites in chromosomes x and xii . since yjm <dig> is not a wine fermenting strain, but is associated to a pathogenic phenotype, the resemblance of genomic alterations related to ty element content between this strain and those isolated from vineyards was surprising and deserves further study.

variability in copy number of transposable elements has been previously reported within the hemiascomycetous yeast clade  <cit> , and particularly in this group of organisms  <cit> . this is in line with previous studies that showed low copy number of these elements relative to s288c in wild-type wine, lager and "flor" yeast  <cit> , as well as in laboratory strains other than s288c  <cit> . the high variability in ty element composition observed in this study supports the hypothesis that retrotransposition is relevant for adaptation, at least in the saccharomyces sensu stricto clade. sequences flanking transposable elements generate variability in the yeast genome  <cit> , probably due to the ectopic recombination involving ty element repetitive sequences, since ty elements play a role in the mobilization of genome fragments throughout the genome, resulting frequently in chromosomal rearrangements and gene duplications  <cit> . variability of ty element content is supported by retrotransposon activity loss or acquisition in some lineages of saccharomyces sensu stricto, correlating with speciation, according to liti and colleagues  <cit> . interestingly, these authors carried out a population survey of ltr-retrotransposons in the saccharomyces sensu stricto complex and showed that ty elements may be absent in groups of geographical isolates and are often lost or horizontally transferred in an apparent homeostatic control of the total number of repetitive elements.

gene copy number alterations differentiate laboratorial and environmental strains
the absence of the tandem repeated asp <dig> region, located in chromosome xii, as well as the ena region of chromosome iv, were observed both in wine and clinical strains . nevertheless, such deletions were found in various strains and are not specific of wine or clinical phenotypes  <cit> . variability in copy number of the asp <dig> genes was found in a comparative hybridization study of  <dig> strains isolated from ale and lager brewing fermentations, suggesting that the presence or absence of these genes could discriminate fermentative yeast  <cit> . however, the absence of these genes in the wine yeasts analyzed in this study, including commercial and clinical isolates, only discriminated the laboratorial strain s288c from the environmental isolates, indicating that the use of asparagine as an alternative nitrogen source is not important in natural niches from were the wild-type strains were isolated.

depletion of the genes of the yrf <dig> family also differentiated the environmental from the laboratorial reference strain. these dna helicase genes are induced in strains with deficient telomerase activity, as part of a mechanism of telomere rescue  <cit> . these genes are present in sub-telomeric y' elements, but seem to be dispensable, since a study on the survival and fitness of an s. paradoxus isolate without telomerase and in the absence of y' elements was similar to that of other well characterized strains  <cit> . although y' elements are conserved between strains and species of saccharomyces  <cit> , copy number of the yrf <dig> family of genes varied remarkably in the group of strains surveyed in this study .

variation in fermentation related genes
genes involved in maltose metabolism, namely mal <dig> and mal <dig>  were depleted relative to s288c in most commercial wine strains, while some of the non-commercial isolates showed deletion of both or just one of these genes. in a similar genomic profile study of commercial wine strains, dunn and colleagues  <cit>  found intra-strain copy number variation of mal <dig> and mal <dig> genes and did not include them in their "commercial wine yeast genome signature". this signature also highlighted the deletion of two copies of cup <dig> relatively to the genome of s288c. however, they found variability in copy number of these genes within isolates of the same commercial wine strain. similarly, these genes were deleted in most of the wine related strains studied here, but not in bb <dig> and aeb fermol rouge in which cup1- <dig> was apparently amplified. these genes code for a protein that binds copper and mediates resistance to high concentrations of copper and cadmium and this locus is variably amplified in different yeast strains  <cit>  and is not exclusive of wine fermentation strains.

variability of copy number among the wine strains was also found in genes of the seripauperin family, namely pau <dig>  pau <dig> and pau <dig>  these genes are encoded mainly in subtelomeric regions and are strongly regulated by anaerobiosis during alcoholic fermentation  <cit> . they play a role in sterol lipid transport and hence their relevance for ethanol tolerance during anaerobic growth. while pau <dig> was depleted in all wine strains relative to s288c, pau <dig> and pau <dig> copy number increased in some of the wine strains, as well as in all clinical isolates, but decreased in others, namely in isolates whose genomic profiles were similar to those of aeb fermol rouge. pau <dig> is involved in the response to toxins  <cit> , but no function is yet known for pau <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
our data showed that telomeric recombination and ty element insertion were the main genome diversity features of the clinical, commercial and environmental isolates used in this study. among the variable genes, mostly depleted, were genes involved in metabolic functions related to cellular homeostasis or transport of different solutes such as ions, sugars and metals. clusters of depleted orfs also contained ribosomal proteins, general transcription factors and transcription activators, translation initiation factors, helicases and zinc-finger genes.

in the clinical strains, genes associated to pathogenesis, namely those involved in pseudohyphal growth and invasiveness, did not show copy number alterations. this confirmed previous studies by klingberg and colleagues  <cit> , who did not find specific virulence factors separating clinical from non-clinical yeast strains. despite this, llanos and colleagues  <cit>  found that clinical isolates have a typical pathogenic phenotype when compared with industrial yeasts. for example, secretion of proteases and phospholipases, growth at 42°c and pseudohyphal growth are more pronounced in clinical isolates. some strains isolated from infections may be opportunistic colonizers of the human environment and not commensals of humans. indeed, a recent survey of  <dig> yeast invasive infections revealed that 50% of them were caused by saccharomyces boulardii, which is used as a probiotic preparation for the treatment of antibiotic-related diarrhea  <cit> .

the genomic variability found in this study supported other studies showing duplication and deletion of sub-telomeric genes involved in secondary metabolism linked to environmental adaptation  <cit> . in this study, the sub-telomeric genes whose copy number changed, namely mal, flo, hxt, pho, imd, sor, pau, fit and arr family genes, did not identify specific alterations of environmental or of commercial wine strains. also, our list of genes with variable copy number showed differences with the "commercial wine yeast signature" published by dun and colleagues.  <cit> . however, some of the genes identified in our study confirmed the trend of genome alterations of wine strains highlighted by the "commercial wine yeast signature". for example, the imd and pho genes were amplified and the mal genes were deleted in both studies. genome variability associated with retrotransposon mobility was characteristic of wine strains. therefore, these variability mechanisms may have a positive impact on the fitness of strains during colonization of new environment. in other words, this present study highlights the usefulness of yeast as a model system to study genomic variability in the context of environmental and evolutionary genomics.
