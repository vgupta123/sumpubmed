BACKGROUND
the identification of proteins by tandem mass spectrometry  is an important step in many proteomics studies  <cit> . the introduction of orthogonal peptide separation techniques coupled to the mass spectrometer, such as multidimensional protein identification technology   <cit>  and combined fractional diagonal chromatography   <cit> , has significantly increased the potential throughput of tandem mass spectrometry experiments, enabling the identification of 100s or 1000s of proteins from a single sample. yet, this potential has not been fully realized because the vast amount of primary data generates computational burdens, notably time-consuming and processor-intensive tandem mass spectra interpretation. the most widely-used interpretation programs, such as sequest  <cit> , x!tandem  <cit>  and mascot  <cit> , use amino acid sequence databases that are expanding in size daily. recently, heuristic programs such as x!tandem  <cit>  and pfsm  <cit>  have been reported to reduce search times by 80–90%. even so, an emerging goal for the biologist is to identify the post-translational modifications or mutations in proteins that are often the basis for disease states  <cit> . search time would grow exponentially if the search space is increased to account for all possible modifications.

one approach for reducing search time is to remove ms/ms spectra that are unlikely to be identified. currently, up to 90% of tandem mass spectra recorded in a typical multiple dimensional chromatography  ms/ms run cannot be identified by database search methods. there are multiple reasons for this, including the presence of non-peptide signals derived from chemical or electronic sources. of the spectra that do represent peptide signals, many remain unidentified because the spectra are of poor quality, or because the cognate proteins contain amino acid polymorphisms, post-translational modifications, or splice variants that are not anticipated by the search programs. other proteins are simply not present in the sequence databases.

recently, attempts have been made to infer spectral quality by combining a finite number of spectral features into a score that discriminates low from high quality spectra  <cit> . in general, the methods rely on combining a finite number of spectral features into a score that is a measure of spectral quality and discriminates high quality from low quality spectra. for discriminant function definition, a training dataset partitioned by cross-correlation score  or containing pre-annotated spectra  is used. early efforts focused on defining general discriminant function primarily used for the rejection of low quality spectra prior to database searching  <cit> . more recently, nesvizhskii and coworkers  described an approach where a new discriminant function is defined for each dataset for finding high quality spectra that have not been annotated by a first pass database search  <cit> . bern and coworkers  also prioritized spectra for intensive interpretation efforts and used regression analysis to generate a continuous score measuring the number of b- and y-ions in a spectrum  <cit> .

here, we present a statistical model that assesses the quality of tandem mass spectrum from any lcn/ms/ms run  prior to database searching. in previous work, authors have suggested arbitrary cut-off scores that may be used as a guideline to determine whether a spectrum is a likely candidate for further analysis, but such an approach is undesirable because average spectral quality typically varies with different samples, experiment formats, instruments and laboratories. furthermore, even if the discriminant function has been adapted for a particular dataset, arbitrary cut-off scores are difficult to interpret in relation to their ability to reject low quality spectra. we therefore build on previous efforts and present a freely-available program that assigns the probability that a tandem mass spectrum will yield a positive peptide identification. we show that our assigned probability is indeed a good estimate of the observed value and therefore is of practical use in a proteomics lab using different instrument platforms or different types of experimental samples. msmseval is useful for reducing search processing time and for selecting high quality unidentified spectra for further assessment.

RESULTS
algorithm development
experimental datasets
two groups of experimental ms/ms datasets were used to train and evaluate the spectral quality evaluation algorithm.

1) the ucd dataset was generated in-house and consisted of  <dig>  ms/ms spectra from  <dig> lcn/ms/ms runs, including commercial standard proteins, cultured cell extracts, and human vascular proteins, were acquired from different samples over a  <dig> month period. three different database search strategies were used to annotate the dataset.

briefly, sequest  <cit> /peptideprophet  <cit> /proteinprophet  <cit>  was used to identify spectra whose annotated amino acid sequences were presented in the uniprotkb/swiss-prot database . inspect  <cit>  was used to identify peptides based on sequence tags and pepnovo  <cit> /spider  <cit>  used a combined de novo/tag approach . the three strategies represent distinct approaches to identifying peptides from experimental tandem mass spectra .

if a spectrum is matched by any of the three search methods described, these were regarded as annotated. of the  <dig>  spectra,  <dig>  were annotated and therefore classed as identifiable . the presence of mislabeled spectra in the training data could degrade the accuracy of prediction of the resulting classifier  <cit> . to minimize this, we applied a 9-fold cross-validation/k-nearest neighbor strategy .

the  <dig> runs were randomly divided into training and test datasets such that the training dataset consisted of  <dig> runs with  <dig>  identified and  <dig>  unidentified, while the test dataset consisted of  <dig> runs with  <dig>  identified and  <dig>  unidentified.

2) isb dataset. the second dataset was the publicly available isb dataset consisting of  <dig> lc/ms/ms runs of artificially generated protein mixture digests  <cit> . we used this dataset to compare identification probabilities predicted using our program to the identification frequencies observed by tsur and coworkers who used a "blind" approach resulting in the identification of many modified proteins  <cit> . this dataset consists of  <dig>  ms/ms spectra. initial efforts using sequest by isb annotated  <dig>  spectra, while tsur and coworkers  <cit>  were able to annotate an additional  <dig>  spectra. note that the number of spectra in the dataset appear to differ from those available from the website. this is because the dta files generated by keller and coworkers  <cit>  clustered adjacent ms/ms scans of similar parent mass. because our algorithm evaluates scans individually without clustering, the spectra annotations from isb and tsur and coworkers  <cit>  were "declustered" to generate our dataset.

spectral features
a set of spectral features, similar to those used by previous workers, was used to measure the quality of ms/ms spectra. we applied a unique normalization procedure in an attempt to capture specific information from b or y ions that may be present. the intensity of peaks was initially normalized by assigning to each peak its intensity rank within a local segment, i, of  <dig> m/z for each spectrum, this value being chosen because there normally will be no more than one y and b ion within such a segment unless the charge state of the precursor ion is  <dig> or greater. this improves the signal-to-noise ratio for the whole spectrum by taking advantage of the fact that b or y ions are typically the most intense ions within any local region of a peptide tandem mass spectrum  <cit> . we tested all features in combination, details are reported in appendix  <dig> 

in order to eliminate potential feature bias between spectra generated from singly and multiply charged precursors, these were distinguished using a similar algorithm similar to that described by hansen and co-workers  <cit> , and the maximum m/z value, was adjusted to the mass of the precursor ion for spectra derived from singly charged ions. we found no significant performance differences when we streamed our data into + <dig>  + <dig>  and + <dig> sets, in agreement with previous reports  <cit> . the definition of each spectral feature can be found in the experimental methods section.

combining spectral features by logistic regression
the next step is to combine spectral features in order to make predictions on their general quality. numerous classification algorithms may be used. in general, non-linear classifiers such as quadratic discriminant analysis  or multi-layered artificial neural networks tend to provide better classification than linear classifiers such as linear discriminant analysis  if the dataset is not linearly separable. to test whether non-linear classifiers are likely to be advantageous in this case, the training dataset was used to train a quadratic discriminant function and a linear discriminant function. the functions were then evaluated using our ucd test dataset. in this case, no significant difference was observed  and as result a linear classifier was chosen for its simplicity in application and interpretation.

logistic regression is a method that allows the discrimination between two or more groups of samples based on a vector of given variables for each sample through a logistic function. the basis of the method is similar to that of linear discriminant analysis  in combining spectral features by a weighted linear function, such that,

where xi are the spectral features described previously and ci the corresponding coefficients. however, unlike lda, logistic regression express d as a probability of being "true" through the use of a logistic function, such that,

where θ is a value between  <dig> and  <dig>  indicating the probability of a spectrum with value d being "true" or in our case, being an identifiable spectrum. the principle of maximum likelihood is applied by iteratively finding the best estimates for coefficients ci such that the training data best fit equation  <dig>  unlike lda, the discriminant function d is maximized by maximum likelihood, relaxing the assumptions required to construct the model. for example, the features do not need to be normally distributed and the number of identifiable and unidentifiable training samples need not be similar. further, because the maximization of the logistic function is probability based, the significance of features can be easily evaluated through analysis of the t-statistic, given the standard errors of the estimated coefficients.

we selected spectral features for the final model in an iterative process, removing features that did not contribute significantly to the final discriminant model. a logistic regression model was computed using all features available, using the computed coefficient and t-statistic for each variable to interpret their contribution to the model. it was found that intnratio20% and h2oratio did not contribute significantly based on our training set . these features were then removed and the discriminant model recalculated.

statistical modeling of the identifiable and unidentifiable spectra distributions
once the features of a spectrum are combined into a discriminant score, a statistical model can be used to assess the likelihood of that spectrum being identifiable or unidentifiable based on the spectra distributions of the complete dataset. the first step is to build models for the identifiable and the unidentifiable spectra.

where + corresponds to "identifiable spectrum", μ+ and σ+ are the mean and standard deviation of the distribution respectively. the conditional probability p, where – corresponds to "unidentifiable spectrum" is similarly computed using the mean and standard deviation of the unidentifiable spectra distribution.

since the estimated distributions will not match the observed distributions for each new dataset, the problem may now be treated as learning a mixture of two gaussian distributions. an efficient algorithm that is commonly applied to perform unsupervised learning of mixture models is the expectation-maximization  algorithm  <cit> . this algorithm calculates the maximum likelihood estimation for fitting a given model. the peptideprophet  <cit>  software for predicting likelihoods for a correctly annotated ms/ms spectrum uses a similar approach. in this case, the em algorithm is initialized using the prior probabilities and parameters of the distributions estimated from our combined test dataset . the em algorithm optimizes these by iteratively calculating the expected probability assignment, p for each spectrum, using equation  <dig> and bayes' law

the prior probability for the unidentifiable spectra is ). the distribution parameters are calculated similarly but use ) as the likelihood estimate for a spectrum being unidentifiable.

the em algorithm is allowed to run until there are no significant changes to the estimated parameters between iterations. supplementary figure  <dig>  show examples of the algorithm used to fit datasets with different spectra distributions. in general the predicted identifiable and unidentifiable spectra distributions match the observed well, especially for the ucd dataset. for the isb example, the unidentified spectra distribution is less well modeled; this may be a consequence of the smaller number of spectra available, or may reflect the need to include an additional distribution for effective modeling. nevertheless, the predicted model still provides a reasonable estimate and importantly, the identifiable distribution is modeled well which is of principal importance for finding high quality spectra.

illustrative examples
removal of low quality unidentifiable spectra
we demonstrate the use of the assigned probabilities as a method for removing spectra that are unlikely to be identifiable from the test datasets. runs of the ucd test dataset and isb dataset were each analyzed and modeled separately using msmseval. to demonstrate the accuracy of the algorithm, the estimated fraction of identifiable spectra removed at various points  is plotted against the actual observed fractions .

for the ucd test dataset , it can be seen that observed and predicted fractions for the identified spectra show reasonable agreement. the error bars indicate that there is some variance in the prediction between the datasets, this is likely due to the diversity of runs within the test dataset. as expected, the variance between runs from the isb dataset is lower than for the ucd dataset . this is because runs within the isb dataset contain a low number of proteins, are of similar constituents and was presumably acquired during a single study. in the ucd case the data comprised of diverse real world examples from an active proteomics lab. it is also observed that the predicted fraction slightly underestimates the observed fraction, probably because spectra annotated by sequest were not filtered by peptideprophet  and as a result there are a higher number of low quality identified spectra. nevertheless, in both cases, the fraction of unidentified spectra removed is significantly higher than identified for fractions less than one.

guide for finding modified spectra
to demonstrate that the model is reliable in predicting the probability that a spectrum is identifiable, p, the estimated probability is plotted against the observed probability for the isb dataset . spectra were sorted based on the predicted p, and for bins of  <dig> spectra, the average p was calculated and plotted against the fraction of observed identifiable spectra in those same bin. figure 3a shows that when p is plotted against spectra that were only annotated using sequest , the observed probabilities underestimate the predicted probabilities  =  <dig>  are being identified when one would expect 90%). however with the addition of the spectra representing mostly modified peptide annotated by tsur and coworkers   <cit> , it can be seen that the observed probability becomes significantly closer to the predicted probability .

despite the improvement, the estimated probability still appears to over-estimate the observed, particularly for higher p. to investigate whether this discrepancy all remaining unidentified spectra with p >  <dig>   were further analysed as described in the experimental section. of these spectra,  <dig> were deemed to be correctly annotated confirming that there were indeed unannotated high quality spectra that were still unidentified. the newly annotated spectra belonged to one of the following three categories :

1) two new proteins. a number of spectra were annotated as peptides of bovine alpha-s <dig> and alpha-s2-casein which are proteins not from the original set of  <dig> standard proteins.  <dig> and  <dig> spectra were assigned to unique tryptic fragments of one of these proteins by sequest and inspect respectively against a uniprot database  giving very strong evidence that the annotations are correct. the bovine beta-casein preparation from sigma c <dig> is only > 90% pure, while alpha casein is also present in bovine milk.

2) further spectra of unmodified peptides of one of the  <dig> standard proteins were annotated. these were found by increasing the tolerance for mass errors allowed in our searches.

3) spectra of modified peptides of one of the  <dig> standard proteins. it is perhaps surprising that previous efforts by tsur and coworkers  <cit>  did not identify these spectra, however this could be due to a number of factors including the use of different parameters  or a different version of inspect. the majority of modifications observed were multiple methionine oxidations. however, we also observed amino acid polymorphisms. for example the mutation of gln- <dig> into pro in rabbit myosin heavy chain. there is sufficient evidence that this annotation is correct as it is observed  <dig> times in the inspect blind search, in all cases with a p-value below  <dig> . in addition, the mutation of glutamine into proline is reasonable given that it only requires the mutation of a single dna base.

notably, the inclusion of the newly annotated spectra into figure 3a increases the correspondence between the predicted p and the observed probability . in fact,  <dig> % of all spectra in the isb dataset with a predicted p of greater than  <dig>  have now been annotated .

discussion
our results and previous work show that the ability to assess the quality of tandem mass spectra independent of database searching can improve throughput and performance of ms-based proteomics projects. we demonstrated the use of msmseval on data from different real life sources, and show that computed probabilities reflect the observed values, and are therefore useful for removing low quality spectra prior to database searching, and/or for locating high quality unassigned spectra. for instance, removing 50% of poor quality  spectra would result in removal of only ~2%  to ~1%  of high quality . notably, our algorithm automatically adjusts the p values to the slight variations of spectral quality distributions in the different datasets.

ideally, the spectral quality discriminant function should be retrained for each type of data acquired on different instruments  <cit> . the em algorithm automatically adapts the statistical models to different discriminant functions and will account for variations between datasets. nevertheless, the use of a new discriminant function specific to each dataset should provide greater accuracy, and our software implementation, msmseval, provides the ability to use newly trained discriminant functions. furthermore, while generally the em algorithm will converge on the correct local minimum given a large sample size , it is acknowledge that skewed datasets such as those with very few identifiable spectra will pose a greater challenge for the em algorithm to converge at the correct solution. to increase the robustness of the em algorithm, options are available in the software to constrain the gaussian mixture model parameters. like the discriminant function, such constrains can be altered based on new training datasets.

while the major contribution of this work is the development of a method to statistically model the quality distribution of tandem mass spectra, we have also shown that there are indeed significant numbers of high quality spectra that remain unannotated in multidimensional lc/ms/ms experiments and that these can be retrieved by msmseval with high confidence. using the well annotated isb dataset, we show that this may reflect the presence of unknown contaminants, amino acid polymorphisms, or post-translational modifications. currently attempts are being made to annotate high quality unidentified samples from our ucd dataset. as many of the samples are from "real life" human vascular proteins, it is anticipated that the range of unknown proteins, posttranslational modifications and amino acid polymorphisms will be significantly greater than those present in standard datasets such as the isb dataset. efforts to annotate such spectra will require the use of translated genome sequences in combination with blind searches for unanticipated modifications. these analyses are extremely time consuming  and the use of spectra quality assessment is a major step towards enabling such searches.

CONCLUSIONS
a probability based method of assessing the quality of peptide tandem mass spectra has been developed by empirically modeling the distribution of spectra within a single or multidimensional lc/ms/ms run based on selected spectral features. the ability to rapidly and accurately estimate the quality of a tandem mass spectrum brings significant benefits to high-throughput proteomics, 1) the fraction of potentially identifiable spectra that may be removed can be estimated when rejecting low quality spectra, and 2) the probability that a given spectrum will be identifiable will allow greater selectivity when focusing efforts toward identifying unannotated high quality spectra.
