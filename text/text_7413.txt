BACKGROUND
viruses are an important component of aquatic food webs. they contribute significantly to the mortality of marine microorganisms and consequently alter species composition and influence the flow of carbon and energy within an ecosystem  <cit> . as such, accurate and reproducible estimates of virus abundance from environmental samples are essential to our understanding of aquatic biology and biogeochemistry. the earliest estimates of virus-like particles  in aquatic samples relied on transmission electron microscopy   <cit> . however, the high cost, limited availability, and laborious nature of tem quickly led investigators to switch to epifluorescence microscopy approaches  <cit>  using nuclepore™ track-etched polycarbonate membranes   <cit>  and methods originally described for enumerating bacteria  <cit> . due to slow flow rates, nuclepore membranes were subsequently replaced by anodisc™ inorganic  membranes    <cit> . anodisc membranes are available in  <dig> and  <dig> mm diameters. the  <dig> mm membrane with a built-in support ring is commonly used to determine vlp abundances in natural systems and is recommended in several published protocols  <cit> . however, the establishment of a protocol using the  <dig> mm membranes, lacking a support ring, has the advantages of significantly reducing processing costs  and the amount of sample required.

RESULTS
a practical limitation of the  <dig> mm anodisc membranes is the lack of a peripheral support ring to facilitate handling of the membranes. to alleviate this limitation, we constructed custom filter holders and used modifications of traditional protocols for enumeration of vlp. the feasibility of using nuclepore filters for viral enumerations was also revisited using modified protocols to reduce filtration times. in part, our motivation to reevaluate the feasibility of nuclepore membranes for vlp enumeration was prompted by production problems of anodisc membranes  <cit> , which have been subsequently resolved but serve as a reminder that the availability of alternate protocols would be useful.

construction of custom filter holders for  <dig> mm anodisc membranes
filter towers were constructed using the inlet portion of a  <dig> mm swinnex filter holder  that was bonded to a makeshift funnel, the conical end of a  <dig> ml disposable centrifuge tube . the funnel was necessary as the inlet portion could only hold ~ <dig> μl of liquid and the surface tension caused by the luer-lock was too great to permit an even passage of liquid under vacuum. briefly, the luer-lock was cut off of the swinnex fitting inlet to maximize the opening. next, the tip of the  <dig> ml tube was removed and the end of the tube subsequently finely sanded so that when inserted into the inlet and assembled with the outlet it would not come in contact with the filter membrane. the two pieces were bonded using a cyanoacrylate-type glue and allowed to cure for  <dig> hours. for filtration, the inlet/funnel was screwed onto the outlet portion of the swinnex, which was connected to a vacuum source. this filtration apparatus is inexpensive  and in combination with a manifold, allows for high throughput filtration.

enumeration of vlp using  <dig> mm anodisc membranes
our protocol for preparing virus slides using  <dig> mm anodisc membranes is based on that of ortmann and suttle , with modifications of the staining procedure. back-staining is the standard protocol for anodisc  <dig> membranes and involves placing the membrane sample side up onto a drop of stain, incubating, then removing excess stain by either wicking  <cit>  or applying vacuum  <cit> . however, back-staining is technically challenging due to the small size and absence of a support ring on the  <dig> mm membranes. thus, samples were pre-stained prior to filtration. the detailed protocol is as follows: i) a virus sample was brought up to a final volume of  <dig> μl using  <dig> -μm filtered diluent . ii)  <dig> μl of sybr gold  was added to the sample and then incubated for  <dig> min in the dark. iii) a backing filter  was placed onto the screen of the swinnex outlet and overlaid with sterile milliq water . vacuum pressure  was applied to pull the water through and stopped immediately so not to dry out the filter. iv) the backing filter was overlaid with milliq water  again and a  <dig> mm anodisc placed on top of the water. v) the vacuum was then applied to pull the water through and sandwich the filters together. vi) with the vacuum still on, the modified swinnex inlet  was carefully screwed on and tightened with sufficient torque; excessive torque would crack the membrane and insufficient torque caused particles to be preferentially filtered towards the periphery of the membrane. vii) the sample was added to the center of the funnel. after all the liquid had visually disappeared, the vacuum was continued for an additional  <dig> seconds. viii) with the vacuum still on, the swinnex inlet was carefully unscrewed, leaving the gasket and the two filters on the outlet. ix) the vacuum was cut and the three pieces  were removed as one and placed on whatman  paper to dry for one min. x). using forceps and a needle, the gasket was removed and the filters separated. xi) the anodisc was mounted on a glass slide with anti-fade solution . filtration time was <  <dig> min per ml. parallel samples were also prepared with a post-stain rinse, where  <dig> μl of  <dig> -μm filtered media or seawater was added to the funnel and pulled through with the vacuum.

enumeration was performed on a leica dmrxa using filter cube l <dig> . for each slide,  <dig> fields and at least  <dig> particles were counted. to calculate the concentration of virus particles ml- <dig>  the average number of particles per field was multiplied by the dilution factor and microscope conversion factor and then divided by the volume of sample filtered . the microscope conversion factor was calculated as the filterable area of the membrane divided by the area of each individual field. variance in the filterable area using the meniscus loading method for the  <dig> mm anodisc filters and the swinnex filter holders for the  <dig> mm filters was  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively.

comparison of vlp counts using anodisc membranes and evaluation of staining methods
vlp concentrations were determined from three sample types with both anodisc membranes: a viral lysate of a marine cyanobacterium, open ocean surface seawater and coastal surface seawater. three replicate slides were prepared for each sample type and method. previous studies have recommended a rinse step following staining of anodisc  <dig> mm membranes when processing natural samples with high organic matter content  to reduce background fluorescence  <cit> . thus, we conducted a comparison of rinsing and no rinsing for both anodisc membrane sizes across the three sample types. we also compared staining approaches  for the anodisc  <dig> mm membranes. the cyanophage viral lysates gave indistinguishable vlp counts  regardless of membrane diameter, staining and rinsing procedure. the two environmental samples showed variation among the methods tested that were due to the rinse step. viral abundances determined using the two anodisc membranes were significantly different  when the post-rinse step was omitted. however, differences were not significant between the two membrane types when the post-rinse step was applied  . replicate seawater samples had a higher coefficient of variation  than phage lysates . the higher variance amongst the replicate seawater samples is attributed to sample microheterogeneity. microbial heterogeneity in natural aquatic samples is well known; bacteria and viruses have been shown to form aggregates or be in close association with organic particles  <cit> .

discrepancies in vlp counts due to staining method and post-rinsing are most likely a reflection of differences in concentration and composition of viral communities  as well as organic material in the natural samples. for example, coastal environments and other highly productive systems typically contain a higher proportion of eukaryotic algae in the plankton then do oligotrophic systems, such as the open ocean  <cit> . viruses that infect algae are routinely isolated and have been shown to be quite large in size  and contain large genomes  <cit> . a higher proportion of smaller, less fluorescent viruses in the open ocean could contribute to lower vlp counts after post-rinsing. the issue of including a post-rinse in the processing of natural samples for vlp enumeration is environment dependent and beyond the scope of this report, which is designed to illustrate the comparability of sample processing with the  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm anodisc membranes.

analysis of nuclepore membranes
the same samples described in the previous section were also processed using nuclepore filters. due to the low flow rate of nuclepore membranes, filtering times have been traditionally quite long . to maximize flow rates, existing protocols were modified. specialized backing filters and filter holders were used and details are provided in the methods section. vlp enumeration from natural samples using nuclepore membranes were generally an order of magnitude lower than parallel enumerations conducted using the anodisc membranes . furthermore, analysis of nuclepore filtrate subsequently passed through anodisc membranes indicated vlp were passing through these membranes. thus, nuclepore membrane pore sizes were analyzed using scanning electron micrographs as described in the methods section. pore sizes were consistent in membranes pre- and post-filtration. however, the pore sizes for nuclepore  <dig> membranes were not uniform and ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nm in size with the majority of pores being <  <dig> nm ; the nuclepore  <dig> membranes were also not uniform and ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nm in size with the majority of pores being <  <dig> nm  .

CONCLUSIONS
modifications of existing protocols allow the reliable use of anodisc  <dig> membranes for enumeration of vlp using epifluorescence microscopy. in parallel studies, we found that nuclepore filters  consistently yielded lower observable vlp. these low counts may be attributed to non-uniform pore sizes that were evident by scanning electron microscopy of these filters . however, more rigorous parallel comparisons of the nuclepore and anodisc membranes are necessary to determine this conclusively. differences in vlp abundance estimates between anodisc  <dig> and  <dig> membranes were evident with environmental samples if a post-rinse step was not included in sample processing. while rinsing of membranes gave the most consistent results across the two anodisc membranes, it may result in loss of enumeration of vlp depending upon the environment from which the sample was derived. given the heterogeneity of natural virus populations, individual investigators will need to consider the issue of applying a post-rinse on a case-by-case basis.
