BACKGROUND
photorhabdus is a genus of gram negative bioluminescent bacteria that are members of the enterobacteriaceae and are therefore close relatives of important mammalian pathogens such as escherichia coli and salmonella. photorhabdus have a complex life-style that involves a pathogenic interaction with insect larvae and a mutualistic interaction with nematodes from the family heterorhabditis . the bacteria can be normally found colonizing the gut of the infective juvenile  stage of the nematode. the ij is a free-living, soil-dwelling stage of the nematode whose role is to seek out and infect susceptible insect larvae. once inside the insect the ij regurgitate their bacterial symbionts into the insect hemolymph and, here, the bacteria divide exponentially  <cit> . the bacteria produce a range of activities, including hydrolytic enzymes, that contribute to the efficient conversion of the insects internal organs and tissues into bacterial biomass and the insect eventually dies of septicemia 48- <dig> hours post-infection  <cit> . at this point the ij recovers to become an adult hermaphrodite that feeds on the bacterial biomass and lays eggs that develop through juvenile stages  before adulthood. after 2- <dig> rounds of nematode reproduction uncharacterized environmental signals stimulate the formation of an alternative l <dig> stage nematode called the ij. the ij is initially colonized by 1- <dig> photorhabdus cells in a complex transmission process that has only recently been phenomonologically described  <cit> . these founder cells grow and divide resulting in a final population of photorhabdus in the ij of between 50- <dig> colony forming units . the ijs then emerge from the insect cadaver ready to search for more susceptible insect larvae.

the heterorhabditis nematode is bacteriophorous and, during growth and development, the nematode feeds on the bacterial biomass present within the cadaver. therefore the photorhabdus cells must be able to satisfy the nutritional requirments of the nematode population. the genetic basis of the nutritional interaction between photorhabdus and heterorhabditis is not well understood. there is some evidence that crystalline inclusion proteins  produced by photorhabdus have a role in nematode nutrition. mutations in the cipa and cipb genes of photorhabdus luminescens nc <dig> resulted in a strain that was unable to support nematode growth and development  <cit> . however the cipa and cipb mutations were pleiotropic making it difficult to confidently define a role for these proteins in nematode nutrition. nonetheless it has been shown that overproduction of cipa and cipb in e. coli can improve the growth and development of steinernema nematodes implying some role for these proteins in nematode nutrition  <cit> . a mutation in another gene, ngra, encoding a phosphopantetheinyl  trabsferase, was also shown to prevent nematode growth and development  <cit> . the ngra gene was shown to be required for the production of small bioactve molecules such as siderophores and antibiotics  <cit> . interestingly the stilbene antibiotic produced by all strains of photorhabdus ) has been shown to be important as a signal for the nematode and is involved in stimulating the recovery of the ij to the adult hermaphrodite  <cit> . moreover we have also recently shown that a mutation in the exbd gene of photorhabdus temperata k <dig> was unable to support the growth and development of its nematode partner, h. downesi  <cit> . the exbd gene encodes a component of the tonb complex which is important in mediating the active uptake of siderophore-iron complexes via their cognate outer membrane receptors  <cit> . the defect in symbiosis of the k <dig> exbd mutant was rescued by the addition of fecl <dig> to the media suggesting that siderophore-mediated iron uptake was important for nematode growth and development  <cit> .

iron is an essential nutrient that is generally found in the insoluble ferric  form  <cit> . many bacteria produce siderophores, molecules with very high affinities for fe3+, in order to be able to successfully compete for fe3+ in their environments  <cit> . the siderophores bind the fe3+ and then bind to specific receptors on the surface of the bacteria. the siderophore-iron complex is then transported into the cell before the fe3+ is reduced to fe2+ and stored as a complex with iron-binding proteins such as bacterioferritin or used for the assembly of important cofactors such as fe-s clusters  <cit> . bacteria also have mechanisms to transport the low levels of ferrous  iron that may be available in their environments. these transport pathways include the feoabc permease and the yfeabcd divalent cation transporter  <cit> . in this study we wanted to undertake a comprehenisive analysis of the role of iron in the symbiosis between the sequenced strain of photorhabdus  and its invertebrate hosts i.e. the insect and the nematode partner, h. bacteriophora. therefore we constructed targeted mutants in genes predicted to play important roles in the uptake of both fe3+ and fe2+ and we tested these mutants for their ability to interact with the different invertebrate partners of photorhabdus.

RESULTS
genetic analysis of iron uptake systems in p. luminescens tt01
we have previously shown that the exbd gene is important for both virulence and symbiosis in p. temperata  k <dig>  <cit> . the exbd gene encodes a component of the tonb complex  that is required for siderophore-mediated ferric  iron uptake in many bacteria  <cit> . the genome sequence of p. luminescens  tt <dig> has been available since  <dig> at which time it was noted that the genome contained the largest known set of iron, heme, hemin and siderophore receptors  <cit> . this suggested an important role for iron acquisition in the life cycle of p. luminescens and we decided to undertake an analysis of the role of iron uptake in the sequenced strain. in silico analysis of the genome sequence of pl tt <dig> identified a single tonb gene  and a single genetic locus containing exbd  and exbb  . to compare the role of the tonb complex in both pl and pt we constructed a deletion mutation in the exbd gene of pl tt <dig> . it would be expected that the Δexbd mutant strain would be crippled for iron uptake via any siderophore-mediated pathway. in pt k <dig> the exbd::km mutation resulted in an increase in the size of the halo produced on cas indicator agar indicating accumulation of a siderophore in the agar . we have previously shown that this siderophore is likely to be photobactin, a catechol siderophore that was originally identified in p. luminescens nc <dig>  <cit> . although the pl tt <dig> genome is predicted to encode a variety of siderophores, it is interesting that the phb genes, encoding the proteins required for photobactin biosynthesis, are not present  <cit> . moreover, the pl tt <dig> Δexbd mutation was observed to have no affect on siderophore production as observed by no change in halo size on cas agar . therefore, pl tt <dig> does not appear to be limited for iron during growth on lb agar. nonetheless we would expect that the Δexbd mutant would be limited in its ability to scavenge for iron under iron-limiting conditions. to test this we cultured pl tt <dig> and the Δexbd mutant in lb supplemented with  <dig> μm 2'-2'-dipyridyl , an iron chelator, and measured growth . in the absence of dip, the growth curves of both the wt and the Δexbd mutant were identical. however, in the presence of dip, it was clear that the Δexbd mutant grew at a slower rate than the wt confirming that the Δexbd mutant was less efficient at scavenging iron.

bacteria can also utilize the small amounts of soluble ferrous  iron that are present in their environments, usually in a manner that is independent of the tonb complex. we identified genes encoding two potential tonb-independent fe2+ uptake systems, the feoabc system and the yfeabcd system in the pl tt <dig> genome . the feoabc system is encoded by the feoabc operon in which feob is predicted to be a gtpase directly involved in fe2+ transport  <cit> . on the other hand yfeabcd is an abc transporter that mediates uptake of divalent cations, including fe2+  <cit> . to test for the role of these genes in pl tt <dig> we constructed Δfeoabc and Δyfeabcd mutant strains . we also combined mutations to produce the double mutants Δfeo Δyfe, Δexbd Δyfe and Δexbd Δfeo and an Δexbd Δyfe Δfeo triple mutant. these iron transport mutants were then tested for their ability to grow on iron-restricted medium i.e. lb agar supplemented with increasing levels of dip. all strains could grow equally well in the absence of dip and, as expected, all strains carrying the Δexbd allele showed reduced growth, compared to the wt, on media containing  <dig> μm dip . in addition, the yfeabcd locus may also play an important role in iron uptake as the Δyfe mutant did not grow as well as wt in the presence of  <dig> μm dip. moreover the affects of the Δyfe and Δexbd mutations appear to be additive confirming that the yfe abc transporter and the tonb complex function independently . on the other hand, the Δfeo mutant was unaffected at all concentrations of dip suggesting that this system does not play a significant role in iron scavenging under these conditions. interestingly the Δexbd Δyfe Δfeo triple mutant was still able to grow on lb agar plates  suggesting that pl tt <dig> has additional mechanisms for scavenging iron.

role of iron uptake in pathogenicity
to determine the affect of the iron transport mutations on virulence we injected approximately  <dig> cfu of each strain into  <dig> galleria mellonella larvae. pl tt <dig> killed the insects in around  <dig> h, as did both the Δyfe and Δfeo mutant strains . on the other hand no insects injected with the Δexbd mutant died over the  <dig> h period of the experiment . the Δexbd mutant was also avirulent when injected into larvae of another insect model, the tobacco hornworm, manduca sexta . importantly, in manduca, the virulence of the Δexbd mutant could be rescued by the pre-injection of  <dig> mm fecl <dig> into the insect . we have shown that the injection of  <dig> mm fecl <dig> was not toxic to the insect . remarkably, whilst the Δfeo mutant was equally as virulent as the wt in manduca, the Δyfe mutant was avirulent in this insect host . this suggests that the requirement of the yfeabcd operon as a virulence factor is dependent on the insect host. moreover virulence of the Δyfe mutant could be rescued by the pre-injection of fecl <dig> confirming that the ability to scavenge for iron is an important virulence factor in pl tt <dig> .

role of iron uptake in symbiosis
in this study we wanted to determine the affect of the iron homeostasis mutations in pl tt <dig> on nematode growth and development. therefore lipid agar plates were inoculated with the strains to be tested  and,  <dig> days later, the bacterial biomass was seeded with  <dig> surface-sterilised h. bacteriophora ijs. we observed that all of the pl tt <dig> mutants, even the Δexbd Δyfe Δfeo triple mutant, were as competent as, if not better than, the wt in their ability to support the growth and development of their nematode partner as measured by the ij yield i.e. total number of ijs collected/number of ijs inoculated . this is in sharp contrast to what we had previously observed with pt k <dig> exbd::km where we reported that h. downesi nematodes failed to reproduce on the mutant bacteria  <cit> .

nematode development culminates in the formation of a new generation of ijs that are colonized by the bacteria on which the nematodes have been cultured. therefore, in order to ensure the symbiotic cycle had been completed, the ijs recovered from these symbiosis assays were surface sterilised, crushed individually and the lysate was spread onto lb agar. in this way it was determined that there were, on average,  <dig> cfu of pl tt <dig> present in the gut of each ij . moreover the Δexbd and Δfeo mutant strains were able to colonize the ij as well as the wt . however the Δyfe and Δexbd Δyfe Δfeo mutants appeared to colonize the nematodes at a level that was significantly lower than wt  suggesting that the yfeabcd locus may be important during colonization of the ij .

yfeabcd  is an abc divalent cation transporter that has been shown to transport both fe2+ and mn2+  <cit> . in addition, both yfeabcd and mn2+ have been implicated in resistance to reactive oxygen species   <cit> . photorhabdus have been reported to be very sensitive to the low levels of ros  generated in lb agar plates after exposure of the plates to fluorescent light  <cit> . therefore the low numbers of cfu obtained with the Δyfe mutant could be explained by poor plating efficiencies due to an increased sensitivity to ros. to test this we crushed ijs grown on either pl tt <dig> or Δyfe and plated the lysate on lb agar supplemented with  <dig> %  pyruvate . there was no difference in the number of wt pl tt <dig> recovered from ijs when the lysate was plated on either lb agar or lb agar supplemented with pyruvate . on the other hand, the number of cfu recovered from ijs grown on the Δyfe mutant increased to wt levels when the lysate was plated on lb agar supplemented with pyruvate . similar results were obtained when the lb agar plates were supplemented with catalase  or if the plates were stored in the dark before use . therefore the Δyfe mutant does colonize the ij to the same level as pl tt <dig> although the Δyfe mutant appears to be more sensitive to ros than the wt. interestingly we did not see any difference in the sensitivity of wt or the Δyfe mutant to ros when the strains were grown on lb agar and exposed to 30%  h2o <dig> . therefore the Δyfe mutant is not inherently more sensitive to oxidative stress and the increased sensitivity to ros appears to be dependent on growth within the ij, suggesting a role for the yfeabcd transporter in this environment.

bioassays using h. downesi reveals symbiosis defect in pl tt <dig> dexbd
we had previously shown that the exbd gene in pt k <dig> was required for the growth and development of h. downesi  <cit> . in this study we report that h. bacteriophora grows normally on the equivalent mutation in pl tt <dig> . therefore is the h. downesi nematode more sensitive to the exbd mutation or is the pt k <dig> exbd::km mutant less capable of supporting nematode growth and development in general? to test this we set up a set of bioassays whereby pl tt <dig> Δexbd and pt k <dig> exbd::km were incubated separately with their cognate nematode partner or the nematode partner of the other bacterium. for  <dig> days after inoculation we monitored nematode growth and reproduction and observed that h. downesi did not grow on the pt k <dig> exbd::km mutant, as expected, but did grow normally when cultured with pt k <dig>  pl tt <dig> or pl tt <dig> Δexbd . in contrast h. bacteriophora grew well on all strains tested suggesting that pt k <dig> exbd::km is not generally compromised in its ability to support nematode growth and reproduction. therefore it does appear that the h. downesi nematode has a more stringent requirement for iron compared to h. bacteriophora.

discussion
in this study we have genetically tested the role of iron uptake in the interactions between photorhabdus and its invertebrate hosts. we have constructed targeted deletions of genes on the p. luminescens tt <dig> genome that are predicted to be important in both ferric  and ferrous  iron uptake and we have tested these mutants for phenotypes associated with virulence against insect larvae and symbiosis with h. bacteriophora nematodes. our results confirm that iron uptake is important during virulence of the insect and also reveal some interesting features of the role of divalent cation uptake during the pathogenic and mutualistic interactions of photorhabdus.

in this study we have shown that the tt <dig> Δexbd mutation is avirulent in the two different insect models that were tested. the exbd gene encodes for a protein that is part of the tonb complex that is found in many gram negative bacteria. this inner membrane protein complex  effectively transduces energy  from the inner membrane, across the periplasm, to the outer membrane  <cit> . the tonb complex interacts with outer membrane proteins  and the energy is used to facilitate the uptake of molecules through these outer membrane proteins. bioinformatics can be used to identify proteins that interact with tonb based on the presence of a specific amino acid sequence called the tonb box. in this way  <dig> tonb-dependent receptors, the majority of which  are predicted to be involved in iron uptake, have been identified in tt <dig>  <cit> . in this study we have shown that the lack of virulence associated with the Δexbd mutation was due to the inability of this mutant to scavenge iron within the insect environment as virulence could be rescued by the pre-injection of fecl <dig>  circulating iron in the insect is bound to transferrin and it has been shown that the transcription of the transferrin gene is increased in m. sexta after a microbial challenge suggesting that reducing the availability of iron is part of the insect innate immune response . we have previously shown that a mutation in the exbd gene of pt k <dig> was attenuated in virulence due to a decrease in the growth rate in the insect  <cit> . our data suggests the pl tt <dig> Δexbd mutant strain is unable to grow in the insect implying that pt k <dig> is better at scavenging iron in the insect. although we have not investigated the reasons for this difference we have confirmed that, similar to what has been reported in other pathogens, tonb complex-mediated iron-uptake is critical for the virulence of photorhabdus.

nutritional interactions are one of the major driving forces in symbiotic associations  <cit>  and our data suggests that iron is an important nutrient in photorhabdus-heterorhabditis interactions. during growth and development the nematodes feed on the bacterial biomass implying that this biomass must be able to satisfy all of the nematodes nutritional requirements, including the requirement for iron. we have previously shown that iron uptake in pt k <dig> is required for the normal growth and development of hd nematodes  <cit> . therefore the pt k <dig> exbd::km mutant was not able to support hd growth and development but this defect could be rescued by the addition of fe3+ to the media  <cit> . however, in contrast to this previous work, we have now shown that the exbd gene in pl tt <dig> is not required for the normal growth and development of the hb nematode. cross-feeding experiments, where the hb nematode was grown on pt k <dig> and the hd nematode was grown on pl tt <dig>  suggested that the nematode was responsible for this difference in iron dependency as the hb nematode grew equally well on the pt k <dig> exbd::km mutant and the pl tt <dig> exbd mutant. in addition, although the hd nematode was observed to grow and develop on both pl tt <dig> and the pl tt <dig> exbd mutant, we did observe that the development of hd ij nematodes growing on the pl tt <dig> exbd mutant was significantly delayed compared to hb growing on the same bacteria . this suggests that the hd nematode might be more sensitive to the presence of the exbd mutation  in their symbiotic bacteria. such differences in sensitivity to iron levels may be one of the driving forces in the evolution and diversification of the photorhabdus-heterorhabditis system.

the feob protein is an inner membrane fe2+ permease that requires the feoa-dependent hydrolysis of gtp  <cit> . the feo transporter is present in many bacteria and has been reported to have a role in the anaerobic-microaerophilic environment of the gastrointestinal tract of mammals. in this study we show that the feoabc transporter has no apparent role in either the pathogenic or mutualistic life-styles of photorhabdus. the yfeabcd operon  and afeabcd in actinobacillus) encodes an atp-dependent divalent cation transporter with affinity for fe2+ and mn2+  <cit> . the yfe/sit/afe transporter has been shown to have an important role in the virulence of many pathogens and a recent survey in e. coli has revealed a strong correlation between the presence of the yfeabcd operon and virulence  <cit> . in this study we have shown that the yfeabcd operon is important for the virulence of p. luminescens is some insect hosts. therefore the Δyfe mutant was as virulent as the wt bacteria in one lepidopteran insect host, g. mellonella, but was completely avirulent in another lepidopteran host, m. sexta. this implicates the yfeabcd operon as a possible host-range determining locus in p. luminescens. the defect in virulence observed with the Δyfe mutant was rescued by the pre-loading the insect with fe3+ but not mn2+ suggesting that the role of the yfe transporter in insect virulence is associated with iron homeostasis .

in this study we have also shown that the yfe transporter may have a role during the symbiotic interaction with the nematode, in particular during the colonization of the ij. we observed that the Δyfe mutant has a very low plating efficiency, compared to wt, on lb agar when isolated directly from the ij nematode. this low plating efficiency was rescued by the addition of either pyruvate or catalase, known scavengers of h2o <dig>  to the lb agar plates. therefore the Δyfe mutant appears more sensitive to h2o <dig> than the wt bacteria. the yfe transporter can mediate the uptake of mn2+ and it has been shown that mn2+ can protect the cells from ros  <cit> . although it was thought that part of this protective affect was due to the ability of mn2+ to act as a chemical scavenger of ros, recent evidence suggests that the role of mn2+ during oxidative stress in e. coli is as an enzyme co-factor   <cit> . many bacteria contain a dedicated nramp-like mn2+ transporter called mnth  <cit> . in e. coli the expression of mnth can be induced by oxidative stress and it has been reported that mnth yfe double mutants in salmonella, apec and shigella are sensitive to h2o <dig>  <cit> . therefore mn2+ uptake appears to be critical in some cells for their ability to survive exposure to h2o <dig>  interestingly analysis of the pl tt <dig> genome reveals that there is no mnth homologue in pl tt <dig> and, therefore, the yfe transporter is the only means by which pl tt <dig> is predicted to be able to obtain mn2+ from the environment. however we could not detect any inherent increase in the sensitivity of the Δyfe mutant to h2o <dig> during growth on lb agar plates. this suggests that there is something specific about the conditions within the nematode that induces the h2o2-sensitive phenotype in pl tt <dig> Δyfe. recent studies in the model nematode caenorhabditis elegans  have shown that this nematode produces  <dig> intestinally localized nramp-like proteins that are involved in mn2+ transport from the gut lumen  <cit> . therefore, the levels of mn2+ available to pl tt <dig> within the gut of the ij are likely to be very low. this, combined with the absence of a high-affinity mn2+ transporter, would be expected to result in a significant reduction in the level of intracellular mn2+ in the Δyfe mutant that would presumably also limit the ability of the bacterium to respond to an oxidative stress.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we show that siderophore-mediated iron uptake is important for the virulence of p. luminescens to insect larvae. this is similar to what has been reported for other pathogens and further highlights the relevance of photorhabdus as a model for studying bacteria-host interactions  <cit> . moreover, in contrast to what we previously reported in another species of photorhabdus   <cit> , we show that siderophore-mediated iron uptake in p. luminescens tt <dig> is not required for the growth and development of the nematode. therefore it appears that different photorhabdus-heterorhabditis complexes have specific requirements for iron. in addition we show that the yfeabcd operon  is required for virulence in some, but not all, insect hosts. although the yfe transporter can mediate the uptake of either fe2+ or mn2+ we have shown that this transporter is involved in iron uptake during pathogenicity. on the other hand we present data that suggests that the yfe transporter may be involved in mn2+-uptake during growth in the gut lumen of the ij nematode. therefore, the substrate specificity of the yfe transporter in p. luminescens tt <dig> appears to be dependent on the invertebrate host colonized by the bacteria.
