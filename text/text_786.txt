BACKGROUND
serial analysis of gene expression  introduced by velculescu et al.  <cit>  is a powerful open source method for profiling transcripts expressed in a given tissue. in this technique, mrna transcripts are converted to cdna and then processed 5' to the poly a+ tail to isolate short cdna fragments called "tags." these tags are linked together into long concatemers and sequenced. the length of a sage tag is either  <dig>  or  <dig>  basepairs  following a known restriction site. sage results are recorded as a list of distinct tags whose tag frequency can be tabulated to yield a quantitative measure of gene expression. the frequency counts of each sage tag reflect the abundance of the respective mrna transcript expressed in the transcriptome of the tissue or cell type under study. unlike microarray technology, which is limited to a finite number of known gene sequences arrayed on a chip, sage detects all transcripts expressed in a tissue sample and provides more quantitative information than microarrays. however, the disadvantages of sage are that the technique is expensive, time and labor intensive, and prone to sequencing errors  <cit> . therefore, the total number of sage libraries produced for a study is generally smaller than a microarray study.

annotation for a sage tag is a major task for sage data analysis. many resources have been developed for mapping sage tags to genes, for instance, the sagemap from the national center for biotechnology information   <cit>  and the sage genie from national institutes of health cancer genome anatomy project  <cit> . although these tools are useful, they rely on high quality databases to make confident tag-to-gene mapping. with only  <dig> bps  per a short sage  tag, it is impossible to directly screen a tag against the whole genome since  <dig> bps are insufficient to identify a unique genomic locus. unigene clusters  is the most frequently used database for searching corresponding transcriptome  of a sage tag. if a tag cannot be mapped to a unigene cluster, it is impossible to determine if the tag is spurious , or represents a rare or novel gene not found in the unigene databases. therefore, it defeats the purpose of detecting unknown genes using sage tags. on the other hand, a longsage tag  is sufficiently long – making it possible to screen longsage tags directly against the whole genome to identify its unique locus with a reasonable chance of success.

due to the short length of a sage tag, it is common to see that a sage tag, especially the shortsage tags, maps to multiple unigene clusters which may be genes or ests,. when multiple genes or ests are found for a single tag, it is impossible to differentiate the tag count for genes/ests that have the same sage tag sequence. therefore, when such shortsage tag is found to express differentially between two samples, it cannot be determined which gene or est is expressing differentially. this can lead to serious problems in interpreting gene expression levels between different tissues or states. the longer tags from the longsage libraries may help correct this problem in addition to providing the opportunity to identify new and unique genes.

although longsage libraries possess several inherent advantages vis-à-vis shortsage libraries, to date, available studies that compared the information content of shortsage and longsage are limited  <cit> . in addition, previous studies focused more on the tag annotation issue than other topics. lu et al. generated four longsage libraries using colon cell lines with/without a p <dig> mutation under either normal oxygen or hypoxia conditions. based on these four longsage libraries, they generated four shortsage libraries by extracting the 10-bp tags from the longsage tags. they limited their analyses on the confident tags, that is, the tags with counts >  <dig>  they concluded that the shortsage more efficiently identifies differentially expressed genes than longsage. they also found that only 4–7% of the redundant confident shortsage tags can be resolved by confident longsage tags. similarly, van ruissen et al.  <cit>  did not find improvement on sage tag annotation by longsage tag. that is, both shortsage and longsage have about 30% of tags with reliable annotation. overall, these studies seem to favor shortsage libraries.

in this study, we investigated various issues related to the information content of longsage and shortsage libraries. different from lu et al.  <cit> , we utilized two types of shortsage libraries. one is modified from the longsage libraries as lu et al. did. the other is the real shortsage library sequenced from the samples. we generated four sage libraries  using human brain tissue samples of two alzheimer cases and two controls. we attempted to address the following:  determine the number of tags that can be matched to unigene clusters using longsage and shortsage tags;  evaluate tags that we were unable to assign to unigene clusters;  compare the number of significant differentially expressed genes that can be derived from longsage and shortsage libraries; and  investigate the use and potential advantages of longsage tags in identifying novel genes not listed in unigene database.

RESULTS
*library abbreviation is as the following: longsage ad , tsage ad , longsage control , tsage control , shortsage ad ; shortsage control .

**the information of truncated long sage  libraries for ad and control are listed in the parenthesis.

applying the same strategy described in lu et al.  <cit> , we evaluated the tag-to-gene relationship using confident longsage tags, which are defined for the tags with counts >  <dig>  under this constraint, we still observed more longsage tags in l_ad than l_ctrl. interestingly, we observed similar frequencies of redundant short tags. we found that only about  <dig>  –  <dig> % of tsage tags mapped to multiple longsage tags . further, more than 70% of confident tags can be mapped to unigene cluster, indicating that the overall low tag-to-gene mapping for each library is mainly coming from those tags with tag counts <  <dig> .

aredundant tags refer to tsage tags matching to more than one longsage tag with counts greater than  <dig> 

as expected, the tag-gene relationship is more specific for the longsage tags than the short sage tags. figure  <dig> depicts the distribution of tags based on the number of their corresponding unigene clusters for each compared dataset. the longsage library shows a large percentage of orphan tags  in comparison to tsage and shortsage that have about 18% of orphan tags. this is expected, as the probability of mapping to a unigene cluster is much smaller for a long sage tag due to the extra seven bps. three compared libraries show a similar percentage of tags mapping to a single unigene cluster, that is,  <dig> % for the longsage,  <dig> % for the tsage, and  <dig> % for the shortsage libraries. however,  <dig> % of longsage tags are either orphan tags or map to a single unigene cluster, while both tsage and shortsage libraries still have about 50% of tags mapping to more than one unigene clusters. the maximum number of unigene clusters that correspond to a single tag was  <dig> for the longsage tags, and  <dig> for both tsage and shortsage tags. this may imply that there is a higher chance of obtaining false matches for a shortsage tag than a longsage tag. for instance, of the  <dig>  longsage tags that map to a single unigene cluster, only  <dig>  tags map to a single unigene cluster after converting to the tsage tags, and the rest contribute to the pool of tags that map to more than one cluster which may represent false matches. as theorized, the increased specificity in gene mapping offered by the longsage tags is substantial, compared to shortsage tags.

when we compared the expression pattern between ad and control for three types of libraries: longsage, tsage, and shortsage, both longsage and tsage libraries share strong similarity . this is reasonable as they were based on the same samples. unexpectedly, s_ad and s_ctrl show very similar expression levels for the majority of genes, which is different from the case and control samples used for longsage and tsage libraries. our testing results reflected the expression patterns in figure  <dig>  we detected  <dig> longsage tags,  <dig> tsage tags, and  <dig> shortsage tags with significant differential expression between ad and control . clearly, we detected fewer tags in the shortsage dataset than the other two. although significant, this difference could be due to gene expression variation between samples with the same disease status.

since both longsage and tsage libraries were derived from the same samples, we used these two datasets to measure the relative ability of long and short sage libraries to detect altered gene expression. we found that the  <dig> significant differentially expressed tsage tags were derived from  <dig> significant and  <dig>  non-significant longsage tags. we assigned each tsage tag to one of three categories that are defined based on the testing results of its corresponding long tags:  positive group, if all corresponding longsage tags for the tsage tag are significant;  negative group, if all corresponding longsage tags for the tsage tag are not significant; or  either group, if the corresponding longsage tags for the tsage tag are a combination of significant and non-significant. figure  <dig> depicts the relationship between the  <dig> significant tsage tags and their corresponding longsage tags in these three groups. the  <dig> tsage tags distributed as  <dig> tsage tags in the positive group,  <dig> in negative group, and  <dig> in the either group. interestingly, each tsage tag in the positive group was derived from a single longsage tag, but the tag in both negative and either groups was derived from at least two longsage tags. the maximum number of corresponding longsage tags for a tsage tag was  <dig> for the negative group and  <dig> for the either group. we also examined the number of unigene clusters that mapped to each of the  <dig> significant tsage tags. the tsage tags in the positive group mapped up to seven unigene clusters, while the tags in the negative group and either group mapped up to  <dig> and  <dig> clusters, respectively. overall, the significant tsage tags in both negative and either groups tend to map to more longsage tags and known genes.

one of the most interesting findings is the analysis of orphan tags. the blast  analysis for the  <dig> randomly selected orphan tags revealed  <dig> orphan tags with at least  <dig> bps in the tag completely matched to a gene sequence in human  <cit> . this frequency  is close to the probability of obtaining one gene sequence perfectly matched to  <dig> bps of a given tag under an assumed human genome size of  <dig>  ×  <dig> bps  and equal frequency of each nucleotide occurred at a base. the number of matched gene sequences for an orphan tag increases as the number of matched bps decreases . a total of  <dig> gene sequences were identified through this approach. since the tag sequence used in the blast analysis consists of four bps  from the restriction site and  <dig> bps  from the sage tag, we also restricted our selection to tags that have at least all  <dig> bps in the tag region which match to a gene sequence. the reason for this is that sequencing errors are more likely in the restriction sites rather than in the tag region. under these criteria, the ending position of the matched segment in the tag sequence is always  <dig> and the starting position needs to be less than or equal to five. we found nine orphan tags that met these criteria . four of nine orphan tags matched to a single human gene sequence – with  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> matched bps, which are more likely to be the real transcripts for these four orphan tags.

discussion
the use of sage libraries has been advocated, but technical complexity has limited their use. in addition, the value of long vs. short tag sage has not been widely explored. a few facts for a sage study are listed below. first, the tsage libraries share similar numbers of unique tags and tag counts with the "real" shortsage libraries. the small differences between tsage and shortsage libraries may be simply due to the variation between samples. these outcomes imply one advantage for the longsage libraries as they can be analyzed in two ways . second, to reach a similar number of total tag counts, longsage libraries, due to greater tag length, need to sequence more clones than shortsage libraries, resulting in increased time and cost. third, a large number of orphan tags exist in both longsage and shortsage libraries. in fact, longsage libraries have more orphan tags than shortsage libraries – due to their greater specificity in gene mapping.

identifying differentially expressed genes between tissue samples is often the goal in conducting expression studies. conclusions on what constitutes a significant change in gene expression are usually guided by the p-values derived from statistical tests. one important feature of our study is our investigation on the potential and serious problem of identifying wrong genes using sage libraries, especially shortsage libraries. are genes or ests corresponding to a significant differentially expressed tag real? by utilizing both longsage and tsage libraries, we showed that likely only  <dig> out of  <dig> significant tsage tags  are the presumed true significant tags, because they were derived from significant longsage tags. on the other hand, the  <dig> significant tsage tags in the negative group are probably not truly differentially expressed, because none of their corresponding longsage tags are significant. since the tag count for a tsage tag is the sum of tag counts from its corresponding longsage tags, a false positive result of a tsage tag may simply be due to its mapping to multiple longsage tags. in a real setting, this problem will exist for a tag that maps to multiple genes or ests. when there are only shortsage data available, we will not be able to dissect the tag-gene relationship as described here. we may make a wrong decision by concluding a significant short sage tag by simply looking at the p-value, even if the p-values are very small.

since all  <dig> tsage tags in the positive group  map to a single longsage tag that has high specificity in tag-to-gene mapping, one potential solution is to take into account the number of unigene clusters mapped to a tag in the decision making process. among the  <dig> tsage tags in the positive group , 67% of tags match to two unigene clusters. on the other hand, 53% of tsage tags in the negative group  mapped to more than two unigene clusters. if we treat the tags that map to two or fewer unigene clusters as the presumed true significant tags, we will only include 47% of false ones, which is better than including all tags with false positive results.

through this paper, our tag-to-gene mapping analysis relies on the unigene database. however, a unigene cluster does not always imply a gene. it is possible that multiple unigene clusters refer to the same gene. in our longsage tags analysis, we found that  <dig> % of longsage tags are either orphan tags or mapped to a single unigene cluster, which is less likely to produce ambiguity of tag-to-gene mapping. for the remaining  <dig> % of longsage tags,  <dig> %  map to two unigene clusters. while it is not our main focus to dissect the property of each unigene cluster in this paper, we found that  <dig> % of  <dig> longsage tags have the same description for the two clusters even though their unigene ids are different. therefore, it is possible that some of these longsage tags are in fact mapping to a single gene, which may increase the specificity of tag-to-gene mapping for longsage tags.

the large number of orphan tags also represents the limitation of the unigene database. we showed that there is a potential to use long sage tags to identify novel genes that are not listed in the unigene database. unlike the short sage tag, the long sage tag has a sufficient number of nucleotides – allowing us to perform blast analysis to search for novel genes. in this study, our criteria in blast analysis is to search for at least  <dig> bps of a sage tag matched to a human gene sequence without any gaps. under this search, we were able to identify  <dig> genes for  <dig> orphan tags. more specifically, nine orphan tags were found to have the full  <dig> bps within the tag region, matching to a human gene sequence, and the number of genes identified reduced to  <dig>  the best results in our blast search are the four orphan tags that matched to a single gene sequence by  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> bps. considering the probability of obtaining one matched gene sequence is as low as  <dig> % for  <dig> bps,  <dig> % for  <dig> bps, and 4% for  <dig> bps for a genome size of  <dig>  ×  <dig> bps, it is highly possible that these are real genes corresponding to these four orphan tags. from this blast study, we should be able to resolve 4–9% of orphan tags. although we surveyed only  <dig> orphan tags, these results are encouraging because we will potentially be able to expand the number of known genes using the longsage library.

although our sage libraries cannot represent other sage studies, it provides a good example that one can filter significant tags based on the number of their corresponding genes. in general, it would seem reasonable to use, at most, two corresponding genes as a cutoff to filter significant shortsage tags. further, if a project aims to be more exclusive in the process of gene selection, one can use the most conservative approach to exclude all significant tags that map to more than one gene.

CONCLUSIONS
the longsage exhibits advantages over shortsage libraries in several aspects. longsage tags appear to have higher specificity in gene mapping than shortsage tags. longsage tags show an advantage over shortsage in identifying novel genes by blast analysis, which may help to reduce the number of orphan tags. most importantly, longsage libraries have advantages in identifying genes that are truly expressed differently between samples, compared to shortsage libraries. in addition we will still be able to perform analysis based on shortsage tags using longsage libraries. this makes the extra costs and experimental time that a longsage library needs worthwhile.
