BACKGROUND
laribacter hongkongensis is a gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, motile, s-shaped, asaccharolytic, urease-positive bacillus that belongs to the neisseriaceae family of β-proteobacteria
 <cit> . it was first isolated from the blood and thoracic empyema of an alcoholic liver cirrhosis patient in hong kong
 <cit> . recently, it was also recovered from the blood culture of a korean patient with liver cirrhosis as a result of wilson’s disease
 <cit> . these cases make chronic liver disease a distinct possible risk factor for invasive l. hongkongensis infections, where intestinal mucosal edema and local immunosuppression secondary to portal venous congestion vasculopathy due to liver cirrhosis predisposed the patients to l. hongkongensis invasion through the gastrointestinal mucosa. in addition to invasive bacteremic infections, l. hongkongensis is also associated with community-acquired gastroenteritis and traveler’s diarrhea
 <cit> . l. hongkongensis is likely to be globally distributed, as travel histories from patients suggested its presence in at least four continents: asia, europe, africa and central america
 <cit> . l. hongkongensis has been found in up to 60% of the intestines of commonly consumed freshwater fish of the carp family
 <cit> . it has also been isolated from drinking water reservoirs and chinese tiger frogs in hong kong and little egrets in hangzhou
 <cit> . pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing showed that the fish and patient isolates fell into separate clusters, suggesting that some clones could be more virulent or adapted to human
 <cit> . these data strongly suggest that this bacterium is a potential diarrheal pathogen that warrants further investigations.

for any gastrointestinal tract pathogen, after transmission through the oral route, the first challenge that the bacterium has to face is the hostile acidic environment of the stomach. when the bacterium invades the intestinal mucosa, it has to survive the attack of submucosal macrophages, which sometimes may be related to its resistance to the acidic environment in endocytic vacuoles. more importantly, for a successful pathogen, the ability of resisting acidic environments is definitely crucial for its survival in different environment and transition from environments to humans. various gastrointestinal bacteria have developed different mechanisms to overcome this hostile environment and evade host defense. for example, helicobacter pylori and verotoxigenic escherichia coli o <dig> have developed unique mechanisms to overcome such an acidic environment
 <cit> . for h. pylori, urease converts urea to carbon dioxide and ammonia and increases the local ph of the bacterium, which is essential for its pathogenesis
 <cit> . during the process of analyzing the l. hongkongensis genome, a complete urease cassette, which includes eight open reading frames, encoding three urease structural proteins  and five accessory proteins  , was observed
 <cit> . in addition, two adjacent arc gene cassettes, each of them consisting of four genes, arca, arcb, arcc and arcd , were also found
 <cit> . arca, arcb and arcc encode the three enzymes, arginine deiminase , ornithine carbamoyltransferase and carbamate kinase, of the adi pathway; and arcd encodes a membrane bound arginine-ornithine antiporter. these enzymes of the adi pathway convert l-arginine to carbon dioxide, atp, and ammonia, which increases the ph of the environment and have been shown to be important for survival of various bacteria in acidic environments
 <cit> . we hypothesize that the urease cassette and/or the arc gene cassettes are important for l. hongkongensis to survive in acidic environments and macrophages. in this study, we tested this hypothesis by systematically knocking out genes in the urease cassette and the two arc gene cassettes in l. hongkongensis and examining their effects in the survival of the single, double and triple knockout mutants in acidic environment in vitro, in macrophages and in a mouse model.

methods
ethics statement

bacterial strains and growth conditions
the bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in table 
 <dig>  the parental l. hongkongensis strain hlhk <dig>  was a clinical isolate from a patient in hong kong
 <cit> , for which the complete genome has been sequenced
 <cit> . streptomycin -resistant hlhk <dig> strain was obtained by serial passage of hlhk <dig> cells on luria broth  agar with increasing concentrations of sm, starting at 10 μg/ml, and increased up to 100 μg/ml. unless stated otherwise, all hlhk <dig> and its derivate strains used in this study were sm resistant. hlhk <dig> and its derivatives were grown in brain heart infusion  broth or on bhi agar  plates  whereas all other e. coli strains were grown in lb or on lb agar  plates . media were supplemented with antibiotics  when appropriate: ampicillin  , kanamycin  , chloramphenicol  , tetracycline   and sm . growth phase and bacterial cell density were determined by measuring absorbance spectrophotometrically at optical density  <dig> 

construction of non-polar deletion mutant strains
primers used for deletion mutagenesis are listed in table 
 <dig>  to generate unmarked, non-polar deletion of urea, suicide plasmid pds <dig> was used for constructing in-frame deletion mutants by homologous recombination
 <cit> . 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of urea were amplified by pcr from chromosomal dna of hlhk <dig>  using primers urea-uf/ur and urea-df/dr, respectively, and the individual pcr products were mixed to generate an in-frame deletion pattern of urea by an overlapping pcr method. the overlapping amplicon containing the in-frame deletion pattern was cloned into puc <dig> followed by pds <dig>  resulting in the final construct of pds132-urea, which was electro-transformed into pir-positive e. coli sm <dig> λ pir
 <cit> . pds132-urea was transferred into hlhk <dig> from transformed sm <dig> λ pir by bacterial conjugation. exconjugants having single recombination with suicide vector pds <dig> were first selected on bha with antibiotics . after that, the positive enconjugants with single recombination were further cultured and selected on lba with 10% sucrose  at room temperature to obtain the final double recombinants
 <cit> . sucrose-resistant colonies were screened by pcr using primers urea-uf/dr and inner-urea-f/r, which were specific for the deleted sequence. all mutant strains were confirmed by dna sequencing.

similarly, non-polar deletion of the urec, ured and uree were constructed respectively as described above . instead of using suicide plasmid pds <dig>  arca <dig>  arca <dig>  arca1/arca <dig> double mutant and urea/arca1/arca <dig> triple mutant strains were constructed using suicide plasmid pcvd442
 <cit> , and amp was used as the selection marker.

qualitative analysis of urease enzyme activity
thirty human strains, including hlhk <dig>  and mutant strains hlhk9∆urea, hlhk9∆urec, hlhk9∆ured and hlhk9∆uree, were grown at 37°c overnight. bacterial cultures were diluted 1: <dig> in bhi containing sm and further cultured at 37°c with shaking, until early-exponential phase . one hundred microliter of bacterial cultures was used to inoculate 2 ml urease test broth
 <cit> . the mixtures were incubated at 37°c without shaking. the color change in urease test broth was monitored at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 48 h with the uninoculated urease test as negative control
 <cit> .

qualitative analysis of adi activity
a chemical colorimetric method, based on the production of l-citrulline from l-arginine, was used to measure adi activity of whole-cell lysates of  <dig> human strains, including hlhk <dig>  and mutant strains hlhk9∆arca <dig>  hlhk9∆arca <dig> and hlhk9∆arca1/arca <dig> <cit> . briefly, 10 ml overnight culture of test strains were re-suspended in 2 ml extraction solution  and lysed by glass beads . one milliliter of supernatants were mixed with  <dig>  ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer  and incubated at 37°c for 1 h. afterwards, 250 μl of 1: <dig>  mixture of 95% h2so <dig> and 85% h3po <dig>  and 250 μl of 3% diacetylmonooxime solution were added into the samples, followed by boiling for 15 min. citrulline standard and the uninoculated reagents were used as positive and blank controls, respectively. the development of an orange color was monitored among the tested strains.

in vitro susceptibility of l. hongkongensis to acid ph
one hundred microliter of overnight cultures of hlhk <dig> and derivative mutant strains were inoculated into 5 ml of fresh bhi respectively and grown to exponential phase , washed with sterile water, and harvested by centrifugation. the ph of the phosphate buffered saline  was adjusted to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> by adding 1 n hcl in the presence or absence of 50 mm urea  and 50 mm arginine . about  <dig> colony-forming units  per ml of bacterial cells were resuspended in pbs of ph  <dig> to  <dig> respectively and incubated at 37°c for 1 h. furthermore, survival of hlhk <dig>  hlhk9∆urea, hlhk9∆arca1/arca <dig> and hlhk9∆urea/arca1/arca <dig> were also monitored at ph  <dig> after  <dig> and 5 h incubation respectively. following incubation, bacterial cells were washed three times in pbs , and serial dilutions of each culture were spread in duplicate on bha to determine the number of viable cells
 <cit> . the experiments were performed in triplicate from three independent experiments.

intracellular survival assays in j <dig> macrophages
j <dig> macrophages  were grown in dmem  supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum  at 37°c in an atmosphere of 5% co <dig>  infection assays were performed as described previously
 <cit> . j <dig> macrophages were seeded to 24-well tissue culture plates at 4 ×  <dig> cells per well and incubated at 37°c with 5% co <dig> for 24 h before infection. log-phase bacterial cultures  of the wild type l. hongkongensis hlhk <dig> and mutants were washed twice with sterile phosphate-buffered saline  and resuspended in antibiotic-free media. infection was carried out by inoculating 1 ×  <dig> bacterial cells to each well at a multiplicity of infection of about 10: <dig> and incubated at 37°c for 1 h to allow adhesion and invasion to occur. after that, the culture supernatants were aspirated and the cells were washed three times with sterile pbs. gentamicin  was then added to each well at a concentration of 100 μg/ml and incubated at 37°c for 1 h to kill the extracellular bacteria followed by washing with sterile pbs and replacing the medium with serum-free dmem containing 25 μg/ml of gentamicin. after  <dig> and 8 h post-infection, macrophages were lysed with 1% triton x- <dig>  for cfus counts. the cfus recovered from cell lysates after 2 h of phagocytosis were considered as the initial inocula and were used as the baseline values for intracellular survival analysis. cfus recovered at 8 h were used to calculate the recovery rate of bacterial cells in macrophages. experiments were repeated in triplicate to calculate the mean of intracellular survival of bacteria.

rna isolation and real-time quantitative rt-pcr
at 2 h and 8 h post infection, the macrophage monolayers were washed with pbs and lysed with 1% triton x- <dig> . total rna was then extracted respectively using rneasy mini kit , followed by treating with rnase-free dnase i  at 37°c for 20 min. reverse transcription was performed using the superscript iii kit . real-time rt-pcr assay was performed in abi7900ht fast real time pcr machine  with faststart dna master sybr green i mix reagent kit , as described by the manufacturer. the sequences of the primers used in the quantitative reverse transcription-pcr  were listed in table 
 <dig>  the mrna levels of arca <dig> and arca <dig> and urea genes were measured by quantitation of cdna and the calculated threshold cycle  corresponding to the target gene was calculated as  <dig> and normalized to that of rpob gene
 <cit> .

survival of l. hongkongensis in mouse model
one hundred microliters of overnight cultures of hlhk <dig> and mutant strains hlhk9∆urea, hlhk9∆arca1/arca <dig> and hlhk9∆urea/arca1/arca <dig> were inoculated into 5 ml of fresh bhi respectively and grown to exponential phase . the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at  <dig>  g for 15 min and resuspended in pbs to about  <dig> cfus/ml. five hundred microliters of bacterial suspension were orally inoculated to groups  of 6- to 8-week-old female balb/c mice which were starved for 6 h previously. mice were sacrificed 120 min after inoculation and the terminal ileum were removed aseptically and homogenized in 5 ml pbs. serial dilutions of the homogenates were plated in duplicate on bha with sm  to determine the number of viable cells
 <cit> . the data were collected from three independent experiments.

pcr amplification and dna sequencing of arca <dig> and arca2
extracted dna from the 30 l. hongkongensis human strains previously isolated from stool specimens of patients with community-acquired gastroenteritis
 <cit> , was used as template for amplification of arca <dig> and arca <dig> genes, using specific primers lpw16076/ <dig> and lpw16078/ <dig>  respectively. the pcr mixture  contained l. hongkongensis dna, 1× pcr buffer ii,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>  200 μm of each dntps and  <dig>  unit amplitaq gold dna polymerase . all samples underwent denaturation at 95°c for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°c for 1 min, 60°c for 1 min and 72°c for 1 min, with a final extension at 72°c for 10 min in an automated thermal cycler . five microliters of each amplified product was electrophoresed in 2%  agarose gel and tris-borate-edta buffer, with molecular size marker  in parallel, at  <dig> volts for 1 h. five pcr products were randomly selected, gel-purified and sequenced with an abi prism  <dig> dna analyzer , using the pcr primers.

statistical analysis
statistical analyses were performed using prism  <dig>  . cfu counts were logarithmically transformed prior to analysis. unless stated otherwise, data generated were expressed as mean +/- standard error of the mean . statistically significance was calculated using the unpaired student’s t-test. p <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant .

RESULTS
examination of l. hongkongensis strains for urease activity
with the exception of native urease-negative l. hongkongensis hlhk <dig>  the urease test broth incubated with all human strains, including hlhk <dig>  began to turn pink after 4 h , and the color became more intense after 24 h of incubation. similar to the natural urease-negative strain hlhk <dig>  mutant strains hlhk9∆urea, hlhk9∆urec, hlhk9∆ured and hlhk9∆uree elicited no color change after prolonged incubation . these results indicated that these four urease genes were all essential for the urease enzyme activity.

examination of l. hongkongensis strains for adi activity
in the qualitative assay, similar to the positive control , cellular extracts prepared from all  <dig> human strains, including wild type l. hongkongensis hlhk <dig>  also generated an orange color, confirming that citrulline was being produced . cell extracts from both single knockout mutant strains, hlhk9∆arca <dig> and hlhk9∆arca <dig>  also yielded an orange color, whereas deletion of both arca <dig> and arca <dig> abolished the adi activity . these results showed that both the arca <dig> and arca <dig> genes encode functional adi enzymes, which could complement the functions of each other.

in vitro susceptibility of urease-negative mutants to acid
hlhk <dig> and mutant strains hlhk9∆urea, hlhk9∆urec, hlhk9∆ured and hlhk9∆uree were subjected to a range of acidic phs  in the presence and absence of 50 mm urea, respectively. since the four urease mutant strains exhibited similar survival abilities under different acidic conditions, only the viable counts of hlhk9∆urea are shown. in the absence of urea, both the parental and mutant strains survived equally well at ph  <dig> and above, but all strains did not survive at ph  <dig> and  <dig> . in the presence of urea, there were no significant difference in the survival levels of hlhk <dig> and urease mutant strains after incubation at ph  <dig> and  <dig> for 1 h, with viable counts of all strains declining slightly at ph  <dig> . when the ph was further decreased to ph  <dig> and  <dig>  the survival counts of hlhk <dig> reduced about 6-log, and the mutant strain could barely be recovered  . these demonstrated that the urease system has a contribution to the survival of l. hongkongensis at ph  <dig> and below.

in vitro susceptibility of adi-negative mutants to acid
to study the role of the two arc loci of l. hongkongensis under acidic conditions, wild type l. hongkongensis hlhk <dig>  hlhk9∆arca <dig>  hlhk9∆arca <dig>  hlhk9∆arca1/arca <dig> were exposed to different acidic phs  in the presence and absence of 50 mm of l-arginine, respectively. in the absence of l-arginine, survival of the three mutants were similar to that of hlhk <dig> at ≥ph  <dig>  and they became susceptible at ≤ph  <dig> . in the presence of l-arginine, wild type l. hongkongensis hlhk <dig>  hlhk9∆arca <dig> and hlhk9∆arca <dig> survived well under all tested phs, suggesting that the two copies of the arca gene performed complementary functions in l. hongkongensis . on the other hand, the survival of hlhk9∆arca1/arca <dig> decreased about 2-log at ph  <dig>  and it was barely recovered at ph  <dig> and  <dig>  . this indicated that the adi pathway played a crucial role in the survival of l. hongkongensis under acidic conditions.

in vitro susceptibility of urease- and adi-negative triple knockout mutant to acid
given the above results that both the urease and adi pathway contribute towards the overall acid tolerance of l. hongkongensis, we constructed a triple knockout mutant strain hlhk9∆urea/arca1/arca <dig> and compared its survival abilities with hlhk <dig>  hlhk9∆urea and hlhk9∆arca1/arca <dig> under different acidic conditions in the presence of 50 mm each of l-arginine and urea. the parental and mutant strains displayed similar susceptibilities at ph  <dig> . at ph  <dig>  the survival count of hlhk9∆urea was similar to that of hlhk <dig> but there was about 2-log reduction in that of hlhk9∆arca1/arca <dig>  and hlhk9∆urea/arca1/arca <dig>  , and the reduction trend became more pronounced after  <dig> and 5 h incubation . at ph  <dig> and  <dig>  the survival counts of hlhk9∆urea started to decrease , whereas there were dramatic decreases in the survival counts of hlhk9∆arca1/arca <dig>  and triple knockout mutant hlhk9∆urea/arca1/arca <dig> strains, which were almost completely killed  . these showed that the adi pathway of l. hongkongensis played a more important role than the urease in resisting acidic environments.

intracellular survival in j <dig> macrophages and mrna expression level analyses
survival of wild type l. hongkongensis hlhk <dig>  hlhk9∆urea, hlhk9∆arca1/arca <dig> and hlhk9∆urea/arca1/arca <dig> in j <dig> macrophages were shown in figure 
4a. survival of hlhk9∆urea/arca1/arca <dig> and hlhk9∆arca1/arca <dig> in macrophages were markedly decreased  but that of hlhk9∆urea was slightly decreased , compared to wild type l. hongkongensis hlhk <dig>  the decrease of survival was more prominent in hlhk9∆urea/arca1/arca <dig>  compared to hlhk9∆arca1/arca <dig>  and hlhk9∆urea ; and in hlhk9∆arca1/arca <dig>  compared to hlhk9∆urea . given the above results, we further investigated the expression level of adi genes  and urea gene of wild type l. hongkongensis hlhk <dig> survived in macrophages using real-time quantitative rt-pcr assay. at 8 h post infection, the mrna levels of arca <dig>  arca <dig> and urea genes were markedly increased compared to those at 2 h post infection  .

survival of l. hongkongensis strains in balb/c mice
to further investigate the role of urease and adi pathway in acid tolerance of l. hongkongensis, we compared the survival ability of hlhk <dig>  mutant strains hlhk9∆urea, hlhk9∆arca1/arca <dig> and hlhk9∆urea/arca1/arca <dig> after transit through the stomach of mice. using this mouse model, hlhk9∆urea exhibited similar survival abilities as hlhk <dig> . in contrast, the viable counts of hlhk9∆arca1/arca <dig> and hlhk9∆urea/arca1/arca <dig> were reduced by  <dig> -log and  <dig> -log respectively, compared to that of hlhk <dig>  . this also indicated that the adi pathway played a more significant role than urease in the survival of l. hongkongensis under the acidic conditions encountered during passage through the mouse gastric environment.

pcr amplification and dna sequencing of arca <dig> and arca2
a specific 739-bp fragment of arca <dig> and a specific 712-bp fragment of arca <dig> of l. hongkongensis were amplified from the dna extracts of all  <dig> human strains, indicating that both arca <dig> and arca <dig> were present in all  <dig> human strains. dna sequencing of the pcr products from five randomly selected l. hongkongensis strains confirmed that the amplified products were arca <dig> and arca <dig> respectively. sequence analyses showed that there were  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotide differences and one amino acid difference between the 739-bp fragments and the deduced amino acid sequences of the arca <dig> genes from these five selected strains and the corresponding region of hlhk <dig>  similarly, there were  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotide differences but no amino acid difference between the 712-bp fragments of the arca <dig> genes from these five strains and the corresponding region of hlhk <dig>  sequence analysis also revealed that most of the conserved residues were present in the partial fragments of arca <dig> and arca <dig>  compared to adi sequences of other bacteria.

discussion
we showed that the arc gene cassettes are more important than the urease gene cassette for acid resistance and survival in macrophages in l. hongkongensis. although both urease and arc gene cassettes have previously been reported to play roles in acid resistance in bacteria, urease function appears to be more important in gastrointestinal tract bacteria such as h. pylori, yersinia enterocolitica and klebsiella pneumoniae <cit> . in fact, the mechanisms of acid resistance are similar in both reactions, which result in production of ammonia, thereby increasing the ph of the immediate environment of the bacterium. as for survival in macrophages, adi pathway has been shown to contribute to survival in macrophages in salmonella typhimurium
 <cit> , but not in listeria monocytogenes <cit> ; and urease has been shown to contribute to survival in macrophages in h. pylori <cit> , but not in brucella suis and brucella abortus <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to compare the relative importance of these two acid resistance and intracellular survival mechanisms using in vitro and in vivo models, although these two gene cassettes are present in many gastrointestinal tract bacteria, such as y. enterocolitica and enterobacter cloacae. by constructing a series of urease knockout mutants, we found that both structural and accessory genes in the urease gene cassette are crucial for the urease activity; which is in line with previous studies performed in other bacterial species
 <cit> . contrary to our initial hypothesis, we observed only a small reduction in survival abilities of the urease knockout mutants in acidic media  and macrophages as well as during gastric passage in the mouse model. this is consistent with our previous recovery of a strain of urease-negative l. hongkongensis  from an 84-year old male with gastroenteritis. sequencing of the urease cassette of hlhk <dig> showed that all eight of the component genes were present with no deletions or frame shift mutations; although there were a number of polymorphic sites that resulted in amino acid changes compared to gene homologues present in hlhk <dig> . on the other hand, the adi-deficient mutant hlhk9∆arca1/arca <dig> showed marked reduction in survival abilities in acidic media and macrophages as well as in the mouse model, indicating that arc gene cassettes play a more important role than urease gene cassettes for acid resistance in l. hongkongensis. in fact, the survival abilities of the triple knockout mutant strain hlhk9∆urea/arca1/arca <dig> were only marginally lower than those of the adi-deficient double mutant strain hlhk9∆arca1/arca <dig> in acidic media and macrophages, and both mutant strains had equivalent survival abilities in the mouse model, which further supports the conclusion that adi play a more important role.

the gene duplication of the arc gene cassettes could be a result of their functional importance in l. hongkongensis. one of the important mechanisms of virulence evolution in bacteria and fungi is gene duplication
 <cit> . l. hongkongensis is the only bacterium known to possess two adjacent arc gene cassettes. the l. hongkongensis mutant strain containing deletions of the arca genes in both arc cassettes exhibited a marked reduction in survival abilities compared to the mutant strains containing single deletion of either one of the two arca genes, indicating that both arc gene cassettes are functional and contribute to acid resistance. phylogenetic analysis showed that the two copies of arc in l. hongkongensis are clustered in all the four trees constructed using arca, arcb arcc and arcd <cit> . this strongly suggests that the two arc gene cassettes result from a gene cassette duplication event. interestingly, in our previous study on differential gene expression in l. hongkongensis at different temperatures, it was observed that the two copies of argb, encoding two isoenzymes of n-acetyl-l-glutamate kinase from the arginine biosynthesis pathway, which have distinct biochemical properties, are also clustered phylogenetically
 <cit> . this indicates that these two copies of argb probably also arose as a result of gene duplication. subsequent evolution enabled the two copies of argb to adapt to different temperatures and habitats. these coincidental findings of gene duplication in two different pathways of arginine metabolism, enabling the bacterium to better adapt to different environmental conditions, argb for temperature adaptation and arc gene cassette for acid resistance, is intriguing.

the present study further strengthened the feasibility of using a conjugation mediated gene deletion system based on a suicide vector in the neisseriaceae family of β-proteobacteria, a strategy which has been widely used in γ-proteobacteria, such as e. coli, salmonella typhimurium and vibrio cholera <cit> . in our previous studies on plasmid transformation and gene expression system in l. hongkongensis, we observed that plasmids commonly used for expression systems in e. coli did not replicate in l. hongkongensis <cit> . therefore, an e. coli- l. hongkongensis shuttle vector, based on a l. hongkongensis plasmid backbone and origin of replication, was constructed
 <cit> . in our subsequent gene deletion experiments in l. hongkongensis, we used a pbk-cmv plasmid that harbored 1000 bp of genomic upstream and downstream of the target gene, but lacked the target gene, which was transformed into l. hongkongensis. this gene deletion system was successfully used to delete several l. hongkongensis genes, such as the flgg flagellar gene. however attempts to delete the urea, ureb, urec and urei genes were all unsuccessful . therefore, the present gene deletion system, which was first used in e. coli <cit> , and also recently used in chromobacterium violaceum, another pathogenic bacterium of the neisseriaceae family
 <cit> , was used for knocking-out genes from the urease and arc gene cassettes. further experiments will elucidate whether this gene deletion system is also useful for knocking out genes in other important bacteria of the neisseriaceae family, such as the neisseria gonorrhoeae and neisseria meningitidis.

CONCLUSIONS
adi pathway is far more important than urease for acid resistance and intracellular survival in l. hongkongensis. the gene duplication of the arc gene cassettes could be a result of their functional importance in l. hongkongensis.
