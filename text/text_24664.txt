BACKGROUND
bread wheat  is the most common cultivated wheat in the world. its flour can be processed into a wide range of food products such as bread, pasta, biscuits, unleavened flat bread , etc. the end use quality of products is mainly dependent on processing quality, which is largely determined by balance composition of biochemical molecules in seed such as seed storage proteins  <cit> , starch  <cit> , phenolic compounds  <cit> , etc. there is a continuous increasing demand for good quality products both by consumers and baking industries. for improvement of processing quality it is important to understand the genome-wide expression of genes and their temporal and spatial distributions. of several approaches for genome-wide study, microarrays comprising a large amount of probe sets of transcripts can be useful for the identification of differentially expressed genes in diverse or contrasting set of genotypes for trait of interest. in this study, two traditionally known good and two poor chapatti making indian wheat varieties were used to identify the candidate genes whose expression changed due to chapatti quality using wheat microarrays.

transcriptome analysis has been used to improve genome-wide understanding of molecular mechanism of gene expression. in wheat, it has been done using either the 8k wheat microarray chips  <cit>  or 61k wheat microarray chips  <cit> . recently, the next generation sequencing has become an important technological platform for investigating genome-wide transcriptional regulation of metabolic pathways  <cit> . however, in a polyploid crop such as bread wheat, sequence assembly and annotation are very challenging due to occurrence of multiple copies of gene sequences . a reference bread wheat genome sequence, and cost-effective and faster high throughput computation system is required for making advances in wheat genomics. despite several complications associated with microarray experiments  <cit> , it still provides a faster and cost-effective method for genome-wide transcriptome study than the next generation sequencing approach.

wheat microarrays have been successfully used for the identification of potential candidate genes under a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses. for example, it has been used for studying the change in transcriptome patterns under biotic stresses such as fusarium head blight  <cit> , leaf rust  <cit> , and insect attack  <cit> . similarly, it has also been used for abiotic stress conditions such as cold  <cit> , drought tolerance  <cit> , high nitrogen level  <cit> , etc. change in transcriptional profiling during seed development was studied using wheat microarrays  <cit> . it has been also used to study metabolic biosynthesis pathway such as starch  <cit>  and reactive oxygen species   <cit> . wheat microarrays have been used to screen and identify seed-specific genes using digital differential display  tools  <cit> . the translocation breakpoints were mapped using wheat microarrays  <cit> . the application of microarrays for gene expression analysis has been discussed in detail elsewhere  <cit> .

the gene expression analysis through seed developmental stages is important for understanding temporal distribution of gene expression, as the seed matures. three stages of major transitions in gene expression have been reported  <cit> . the first major transition is within  <dig> days after anthesis  where extensive cell division, expansion and differentiation occur to make milky endosperm  <cit> . the second major transition occurs at  <dig> daa where starch and seed storage proteins accumulate within cells to make semi-solid endosperm  <cit> . the third major transition starts at  <dig> daa where deposition of storage reserve decreases  <cit>  followed by physiological maturity to turn caryopsis brown. however, the duration of the above stages may change depending upon environmental conditions during seed development. for example, laudencia-chingcuanco et al. <cit>  observed three stages of gene expression patterns during seed development i.e.  <dig> to  <dig> daa ,  <dig> to  <dig> daa , and  <dig> to  <dig> daa . similarly, hierarchical clustering of transcriptome data from  <dig> to  <dig> daa revealed three major groups of expressed genes i.e.  <dig> to  <dig> daa,  <dig> to  <dig> daa, and  <dig> to  <dig> daa  <cit> . therefore, genome-wide transcriptome study in at least three seed developmental stages is important for the identification of candidate genes whose expression changed during seed development for the improvement of processing quality.

several statistical approaches are useful for the analysis of gene expression data from microarrays  <cit> . among them, two-way anova  is the most common analysis method where two categorical explanatory variables of an experiment can be simultaneously analysed by any combination of one level of one variable and one level of the other variable. in this analysis, variation in the expression of a gene which is affected by the level of other gene   can be determined  <cit> . in this study gene-specific two-way anova was implemented to identify candidate genes whose expression changed due to processing quality , seed development, and interaction .

two traditionally known good chapatti making varieties, c <dig>  <cit>  and lok <dig> were used to identify differentially expressed genes in comparison to two varieties, sonalika  <cit>  and wh <dig>  poor chapatti making varieties using wheat microarrays. the genes involved in seed development and interaction  were also studied. since the four varieties might differ for other traits, the involvement of the candidate genes with other traits cannot be rule out in this study. several processing quality related key genes such as seed storage protein genes , which were known to effect processing quality of several end-use products such as bread, biscuit, noodles, etc., shown very high difference in their expression between good and poor chapatti making varieties at early stage of seed development . in addition, many novel candidate genes were identified between the two groups. it is evident that majority of the reported genes involved in processing quality were also involved in interaction of quality and seed development. this information would be helpful to design experiments for gene regulation at specific development stage and for the identification of variations within genes such as single nucleotide polymorphisms  useful for the improvement of processing quality in wheat through molecular breeding.

RESULTS
genome-wide transcriptome analysis was done between good and poor quality varieties at three seed developmental stages  to identify the candidate genes whose expressions changed due to quality, development, and interaction . a total of  <dig>  probe sets  qualified gene expression quality criterion where at least 100% of samples in any one out of  <dig> conditions  had values between  <dig>  and  <dig> th percentile in the normalized data. gene specific two-way anova analysis with multiple test corrections  of the  <dig>  probe sets identified  <dig>  probe sets , which satisfied the corrected p value of  <dig>  . a similar number of the expressed genes  were identified by laudencia-chingcuanco et al. <cit>  among wheat genotypes during cold acclimation and vernalization using gene-specific anova. the analysis partitioned the variation in expression of the probe sets into quality , development , interaction  , and expected by chance i.e. errors  . the number of probe sets passed the test in this study is higher than the number reported by wan et al. <cit>  who had identified  <dig>  probe sets showing significant differential expression through development in a single wheat variety. in this study, a large number of genes were involved in quality and seed development referring to the involvement of many pathways and cellular processes.

fold change analysis of the expression data of the  <dig>  probe sets identified  <dig> probe sets, whose expressions were at least 10-fold between good and poor quality varieties in at least one of the three sources of variations  . among them,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> probe sets were involved in quality, development, and interaction , respectively .

the probe sets were identified through gene specific two-way anova analysis.

identification of candidate genes whose expression changed due to quality
total of  <dig> probe sets were identified for quality which showed at least ten-fold differential expression between good and poor quality varieties in at least one of the three condition pairs  . using blastx similarity search of the sequence of the  <dig> probe sets at ncbi, the putative gene function was assigned to  <dig> , hypothetical proteins to  <dig>  probe sets, and the function was not assigned to the remaining  <dig> probe sets. out of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> probe sets were differentially expressed at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> daa, respectively and the remaining  <dig> probe sets were differentially expressed in either two or three seed developmental stages .

the majority of the probe sets also involved in seed development stage and interaction  as identified through gene-specific two-way anova analysis. the function to the probe sets was assigned through blastx at ncbi website.

+ = involved, - = not involved.

out of the  <dig>   <dig> probe sets , were mainly related to seed storage protein genes . these genes were gliadin , glutenin , and avenin. avenin is oat counterpart to gliadin. glutenin and gliadin proteins make gluten matrix in dough which determines visco-elastic properties of wheat dough during processing. they mainly determine the processing quality of wheat end-use products  <cit> . high molecular weight glutenin subunit  contributes mainly to gluten elasticity property and gliadins to its viscosity property  <cit> . hmw-gs was strongly correlated with bread making quality of wheat  <cit> . gliadin contributes to gluten functional property  <cit> . xu et al. <cit>  suggested that gliadin plays an important role in adjusting and controlling gluten’s viscoelastic properties rather than only just a diluent of gluten’s functional properties. interestingly, at later stages of seed development , these probe sets did not show much difference in expression between good and poor quality varieties.

the differential expression of the  <dig> probe sets of seed storage protein genes, key genes for processing quality, were analysed in pairwise among the four varieties to study variation in expression level among them . it indicates that wh <dig> is more diverse than sonalika with that of c <dig> and lok <dig> at expression level of seed storage protein genes. therefore, among them, the poor chapatti making quality, wh <dig> can be used with either of two good chapatti making varieties, c <dig> or lok <dig> for molecular breeding.

the remaining probe sets showed similarity to transcription factors , peroxidase, trypsin inhibitor, proteinase, amylases , kinases and phosphatase , etc. high differential expression of peroxidase, proteinase, and amylases in good chapatti varieties may have effect on processing quality. these enzymes are being extensively used in baking and food industries for making good quality end-use products.

cluster analysis of the  <dig> probe sets into  <dig> groups identified the co-expressed genes having similar expression patterns in good and poor varieties in three seed developmental stages . in cluster i, the probe sets showed down-regulation in good quality varieties at early stage of seed development  and did not show any change at later stage of seed development. in cluster ii, the probe sets showed up-regulation in good quality varieties at early stage of seed development  and did not show any change at later stage of seed development. in cluster iii, five probe sets showed down-regulation in good quality varieties in all three seed developmental stages. in cluster iv, the probe sets showed up-regulation in good quality varieties at later stage of seed development . in cluster v, the majority of the probe sets showed up-regulation in good quality varieties at early stage of seed development. out of  <dig>   <dig> probe sets in cluster v were related to seed storage protein genes and others to beta-amylase and hypothetical proteins. one probe set for seed storage protein gene  was clustered separately in cluster ii. cluster analysis distinctly grouped key genes for processing quality in cluster v indicating their similar expression patterns in good quality varieties i.e. up-regulated at early stage of seed development . the role of the remaining four clusters cannot be validated to processing quality in the present study, but they represent potential candidate genes for marker development through association studies.

identification of candidate genes whose expression changed due to seed development
total  <dig> probe sets were identified for seed development whose expression changed at least ten-fold between good and poor quality varieties in at least one of the three condition pairs  . using blastx similarity search of the sequence of the  <dig> probe sets at ncbi, the putative gene function was assigned to  <dig> probe sets , hypothetical proteins to  <dig>  probe sets, and similarity of the remaining  <dig> probe sets was not found in the database. out of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> probe sets showed differential expression in  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> daa, respectively and the remaining  <dig> probe sets were differentially expressed in at least two seed development stages . further analysis revealed that out of  <dig>  the expression of  <dig> probe sets was also changed due to quality .

out of  <dig>  the majority of probe sets  were dominated by seed storage protein genes such as gliadin , glutenin  and hmw glutenin subunit, and avenin-like. other genes were related to grain hardness such as puroindolines and grain softness proteins, starch biosynthesis metabolism such as granule bound starch synthase-i , alpha- and beta-amylase inhibitors, peroxidase, trypsin inhibitor, etc. .

four probe sets related to genes for grain hardness and softness showed differential expression from about ten-fold  to about 43-fold  in early stage of seed development i.e.  <dig> daa and one probe set  showed about 22-fold differential expression at later stage of seed development i.e.  <dig> daa between good and poor varieties . grain hardness is considered as a single important trait that determines the quality of end-use products such as bread and cookies or biscuit  <cit> . puroindoline genes coding puroindoline a and b are major contributor of grain hardness. if puroindoline a and b are functional, the grain is soft or both or either one of them are mutated or absent, the grain is very hard  <cit> . out of five, two probe sets  represent grain softness proteins. jolly et al. <cit>  reported the linkage of the genes of grain softness proteins to the grain hardness locus . however, no direct or indirect relationship of this protein to grain texture has been established  <cit> .

the wheat microarray contains probe sets of more than  <dig> genes of starch metabolism. in this study, only gbss  and beta-amylase showed at least 10-fold differential expression between the contrasting varieties. beta amylase  expression was involved in quality and seed development as well as in their interactions . its differential expression  was only present in early stage of seed development . beta-amylase is responsible for starch hydrolysis at the time of seed germination by releasing maltose  of the second α- <dig>  glycosidic bonds from the non-reducing end. it accumulates during grain maturation, but remains inactive till germination.

gbss is believed to be responsible for synthesis of amylose in seed  to late maturity  was observed between good and poor quality varieties. the expression of the gbss gene was involved in both qualities as well as in seed development, but not in interaction of quality and development .

cluster analysis of the  <dig> probe sets showing at least ten-fold differential expression into  <dig> clusters identified the co-expressed genes having similar expression patterns in different seed development stages in good and poor varieties . cluster analysis of the  <dig> probe sets grouped the probe sets in the same cluster having similar expression patterns . in cluster i, the probe sets showed up-regulation in good quality varieties in early stage of seed development  and did not show any much change at later stage of seed development. in cluster ii, the majority of the probe sets showed up-regulation in good quality varieties at later stages of seed development . in cluster iii, the probe sets showed down-regulation in good quality varieties at early stage i.e.  <dig> daa . in clusters iv and v, the probe sets showed up-regulation in good varieties at early stage seed development i.e.  <dig> daa. the key genes for processing quality, mainly seed storage protein genes were clustered in both cluster iv and v.

identification of candidate genes involved in interaction 
total  <dig> probe sets was identified for interaction  showing at least ten-fold expression between good and poor varieties in at least one of the three condition pairs  . these probe sets were involved in development. of them,  <dig> probe sets also involved in quality . further analysis revealed that  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> probe sets  were differentially expressed in  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> daa, respectively .

cluster analysis of the  <dig> probe sets grouped the probe sets in the same cluster having similar expression patterns . in cluster i, the probe sets showed up-regulation in poor varieties at early stage of seed development  and did not show any change at later stage of seed development. in cluster ii, the probe sets showed down-regulation in poor varieties at early stage of seed development  and did not show any change at later stage of seed development. the most of probe sets for seed storage protein genes were grouped in cluster ii. in cluster iii, there was a single probe set  oxygenase family protein) showing up-regulation in poor varieties at  <dig> and  <dig> daa . in cluster iv, the probe sets showed up-regulation in good varieties at later stage seed development . in cluster v, the majority of the probe sets showed up-regulation in good varieties at early stage of seed development.

spatial distribution of the expression of  <dig> probe sets related to processing quality across  <dig> development stages
using gene-specific two-way anova analysis,  <dig> probe sets were identified for processing quality showing at least 10-fold differential expression between good and poor quality varieties. the expression level of these probe sets were analysed across  <dig>  samples which were available online and representing ten developmental stages including seedling, tillering, and flower development stages through meta-analysis using genevestigator software. the heatmap produced after the analysis revealed expression potential of the individual probe sets in  <dig> development stages . cluster analysis of the expression potential of the probe sets distinctly grouped the probe sets into three major clusters i.e. i, ii and iii of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> probe sets, respectively .

in cluster i the expression level of the  <dig> probe sets was global as they were present in the majority of the ten developmental stages . about 42%  of the probe sets was annotated with blastx and showing homology to genes related to cellular and molecular mechanisms such as granule-bound starch synthase i , bowman-birk type trypsin inhibitor, aspartic proteinase nepenthesin- <dig>  cell division protease, peroxidase, sugar transporter, transcription factors ,  <dig> kda proline-rich protein, low temperature specific wheat gene ptacr <dig>  peroxisomal acyl-coenzyme a oxidase  <dig>  etc. about of 51%  of the probe sets were hypothetical proteins to aegilops tauschii and triticum urartu and the significant similarity was not found for the other three probe sets.

except eight probe sets, the expression level of other  <dig> probe sets in cluster ii was low i.e. white or grey color in the heatmap . majority of the probe sets  was annotated with blastx and showed homology to kinases , dna-directed rna polymerase, serine/threonine protein phosphatase, beta-fructofuranosidase, alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitor, transcription factor iif, etc. forty percentage  of the  <dig> probe set was hypothetical proteins and the significant similarity was not found for the other two probe sets.

in cluster iii the expression level of the probe sets were strong in ripening and the majority of them had also expression in germination stage . majority of the probe sets  were related to seed storage protein genes such as gliadins , glutenin , and avenin like proteins. the seven probe sets were related to beta-amylase, trypsin inhibitor, serine/threonine protein kinase and deoxymugineic acid dioxygenase. five probe sets were hypothetical proteins to aegilops tauschii and triticum urartu. the significant similarity was not found for the remaining one probe set.

spatial distribution of the expression of  <dig> probe sets related to processing quality across  <dig> tissues/organs
the expression level of the  <dig> probe sets related to processing quality were analysed across  <dig>  samples which were available online and representing  <dig> tissues including root, shoot, flag leaf, endosperm, embryo, coleoptile, and mesocotyl through meta-analysis using genevestigator software. the heatmap produced after the analysis revealed expression potential of the individual probe sets in different tissues . cluster analysis of the expression potential of the probe sets distinctly grouped the probe sets into three major clusters i.e. i, ii, and iii of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> probe sets, respectively , which was very similar to the clusters produced for the development stages . the percentage of probe sets grouped in both clusters  was very similar i.e.  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> % . briefly, the expression level of the probe sets in cluster i was very strong  and global as they were present in the most of the  <dig> tissues. except a few probe sets, the expression level of the majority of the probe sets in cluster ii and iii were specific to one to two tissues . majority of the probe sets in cluster iii were related to seed storage protein genes such as gliadins , glutenin , and avenin like proteins.

the heatmaps providing information on spatial distribution of the genes would assist in designing functional genomics experiments specific to a particular growth stage or tissue. the correct interpretation of results is very important for formulating new hypothesis and models, and designing proper experiments to test them  <cit> .

pathway analysis of the  <dig>  probe sets
the  <dig>  probe sets  which passed the gene-specific two-way anova  were mapped to metabolism pathways by using mapman software on the triticum aestivum mapping data, “taes_affy_0709”. the genes of several metabolic pathways such as starch , myo-inositol, sugar and sugar-alcohol, and cell wall were up-regulated at early stage of seed development  in good quality varieties . the genes of photo systems  and calvin cycle were down-regulated in early stage of seed development  in good quality varieties . the activities of other metabolic pathway genes were more differentiated at  <dig> daa between good and poor varieties , but less at later stages  of seed development . this indicates that genes for seed development and processing quality are regulated at early stage of seed development.

validation of differential expression by quantitative rt-pcr
the expression profiles of a few randomly chosen genes were validated by quantitative rt-pcr. a set of reference genes has been recently proposed for common wheat such as gene for cell division control protein, aaa-superfamily of atpases , adp-ribosylation factor, arf , and rnase l inhibitor-like protein   <cit> . for this study one house-keeping gene such as arf was used as a reference gene for quantitative validation of the expression data. the two differentially expressed genes, pre-α/β-gliadin and γ-gliadin, were randomly chosen for validation of the microarray data . the individual ct values of the house-keeping gene at the three seed development stages,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> daa, in the two diverse chapatti making varieties, c <dig> and sonalika were used for normalization. the two target genes showed similar difference in their expressions through seed developmental stages between the varieties, which are largely in agreement with the microarray data . for example, the expressions of pre-α/β-gliadin and γ-gliadin genes were very high in the variety c <dig> than the variety sonalika at early stage seed development,  <dig> daa . hence, the microarray data were validated by qualitative pcr.

CONCLUSIONS
genome-wide transcriptome analysis with help of two-way anova in developing caryopsis identified a substantial number of differentially  expressed genes in two diverse sets of indian wheat varieties for chapatti quality. many key processing quality related genes such as different subunits of glutenin and gliadins, puroindolines, grain softness protein, alpha and beta amylases, proteases, peroxidase, gbss, etc. were identified. in addition, many other candidate genes related to cellular and molecular functions were also identified. the anova analysis revealed that the expression of majority of the candidate genes for good chapatti was involved in interaction of quality and development. most of these probe sets showed differential expression at early stage of seed development i.e. temporal expression. meta-analysis revealed that the majority of the genes expressed in one or a few growth stages indicating spatial distribution of their expressions. the differential expression of the two candidate genes, pre-α/β-gliadin and γ-gliadin between good and poor chapatti quality varieties was validated by quantitative real time pcr. therefore, this study able to identify several known processing quality related genes and many additional candidate genes for good chapatti and their interactions with development and temporal and spatial distributions. gene identified for processing quality and information on temporal and spatial distributions of their expressions would be useful for designing programs for improvement of processing quality either by changing expression  of genes or development of single nucleotide polymorphisms  markers using bi-parental mapping populations for molecular breeding.
