BACKGROUND
the hexose transporter gene family in saccharomyces cerevisiae contains the sugar transporter genes hxt <dig> to hxt <dig>  gal <dig> and the glucose sensor genes snf <dig> and rgt <dig>  <cit> . the proteins encoded by hxt <dig> to hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> to hxt <dig> are considered to be the major hexose transporters in s. cerevisiae. the mc996a yeast strain lacking these six transporters and the protein encoded by hxt <dig>  is unable to grow on glucose  <cit> . based on their km values and their ability to restore growth on glucose when the respective genes are expressed individually in the hxt null mutant strain, these transporters have been classified as high , moderately low  and low  affinity transporters. however, hxt2p in cells grown on low glucose concentrations exhibits both high and low affinity transport kinetics  <cit> . gal2p is able to transport glucose with high affinity but the gene encoding it is expressed only when galactose is present  <cit> . in the cen.pk2-1c strain, deletion of only hxt <dig> to hxt <dig> is not enough to completely abolish growth on glucose, fructose or mannose  <cit> . only deletion of all seventeen of the hxt genes and gal <dig> produces a strain unable to grow on these sugars, and overexpression of any individual gene encoding a hexose transporter, except hxt <dig> in this multiple deletant restores growth on at least one of the hexoses: glucose, fructose, mannose or galactose  <cit> .

the major glucose transporters are regulated at transcriptional level by the extracellular glucose concentration  <cit> . the transcription factor rgt1p represses the genes encoding these transporters in the absence of glucose, but it is also required for full induction of hxt <dig> on high levels of glucose  <cit> . paralogous proteins mth1p and std1p are necessary for rgt1p to act as a repressor. release of the repression requires removal of mth1p and std1p as well as phosphorylation of rgt <dig>  the glucose signal mediated by the snf3p and rgt2p sensors stimulates the degradation of mth1p and std1p, while the glucose signal mediated by the g-protein-coupled receptor gpr1p leads to activation of protein kinase a, which phosphorylates rgt <dig> and releases the repression of hxt genes  <cit> . in addition, high affinity transporters are repressed in high levels of glucose via the snf1p-mig1p glucose repression pathway. mig1p binds directly to the promoters of hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> and also represses the expression of mth <dig> and snf <dig>  <cit> .

expression of hxt <dig> is regulated by growth rate rather than the external glucose concentration  <cit> . it is expressed upon decrease in the growth rate of cells in glucose batch cultivations, at low dilution rates in glucose-limited chemostat cultivations, on non-fermentable carbon sources and during sporulation  <cit> . the regulation is mediated by stre and hap elements in the promoter region of hxt <dig>  the stre elements are needed for induction at low growth rates and during growth on ethanol, and the hap elements for growth on ethanol or glycerol  <cit> . the hxt5p transporter shows moderately low affinity for glucose  <cit> .

the hexose transporters encoded by hxt <dig> to hxt <dig> have not been studied to the same extent as the major hxt genes. many of the functions assigned to these transporters do not directly relate to sugar utilisation. diderich and co-workers  <cit>  were not able to detect the expression of these genes when probing total rna from glucose-limited chemostat cultivations. it is known, however, that the regulation of all but hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> is controlled by glucose  <cit> . the transporters encoded by hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> are also shown to be involved in pleiotropic drug resistance  <cit> , and the promoter of hxt <dig> is a target for mac1p transcription factor, which regulates high-affinity copper uptake genes under copper-deficient conditions  <cit> . greatrix and co-workers  <cit>  demonstrated that hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> are induced in the presence of non-fermentable carbon sources, and that hxt <dig> is upregulated when yeast cells are grown on medium containing raffinose and galactose at ph  <dig>  but not at ph  <dig> . in addition, hxt9p and hxt10p are able to transport arsenic trioxide into the cell, as do the major hexose transporters  <cit> .

in addition to regulation at transcriptional level, inactivation of hxt proteins takes place under certain conditions such as starvation or in the presence of high concentrations of glucose  <cit> . degradation via endocytosis, autophaghy, and transport to the vacuole has been shown for hxt2p, hxt5p, hxt6p and hxt7p  <cit> .

in glucose-limited chemostats, the specific glucose consumption rate is inversely related to the oxygen provided to the system  <cit> . under oxygen-limited or anaerobic conditions, energy is provided by respiro-fermentative and fermentative metabolism, respectively. the biomass yield on glucose is lower and the cells must transport more glucose per unit time to be able to grow at the same rate in anaerobic or oxygen-limited conditions as when the metabolism is fully respirative. it is not clear what modifications in the cell are responsible for the higher glucose uptake. in addition, in spite of numerous studies, the mechanism controlling glycolysis in yeast is still unknown. control of individual steps or enzymes of this pathway, such as the phosphorylation of glucose and the control of phosphofructokinase have been extensively studied  <cit> . however, it is likely that the control is distributed over a number of steps, since the overexpression of individual glycolytic enzymes, or of all, did not enhance glycolytic flux  <cit> . glucose transport has been suggested to play a major role in the control of glycolysis  <cit> , and shown to be highly important for the dynamics of glycolysis with substantial control over the frequency of glycolytic oscillations  <cit> . additionally, glucose transport may control the flux of glycolysis, even at high external glucose concentrations if transport capacity is reduced, as is the case in a strain that expresses a chimera between hxt1p and hxt7p and no other hexose transporter  <cit> .

previously, we have assessed the role of oxygen in the physiology of s. cerevisiae by studying the metabolite and transcript levels related to central carbon metabolism  <cit> . in the present study we extend the analysis to glucose transport to determine if and how hexose transporters are affected when oxygen becomes limiting for growth. we probed cells from glucose-limited chemostat cultivations of cen.pk113-1a at five different oxygen levels for the expression of hxt <dig> to hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> to hxt <dig>  gal <dig>  snf <dig> and rgt <dig>  in addition, we studied the expression of these genes under conditions in which oxygen was removed from cultivations receiving it or introduced to anaerobic cultivations.

RESULTS
transcription of hxt genes in cells at steady state exposed to different oxygen levels
five different inflow gas oxygen levels  were used to study the response in expression of genes encoding hexose transporters and glucose sensors to external oxygen in glucose-limited chemostat cultures of cen.pk113-1a. the specific glucose consumption rates were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  cmmol g biomass- <dig> h- <dig> for chemostat cultures receiving  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % oxygen, respectively  <cit> . extracellular glucose was not detected. the strongest expression signals were obtained from hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and hxt <dig>  the signals of hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and gal <dig> transcripts were below the detection limit in these conditions.

statistical differences  in the expression levels of all the hexose transporter encoding genes were detected between at least some of the oxygen concentrations studied . hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> were significantly more highly expressed in aerobic conditions compared to hypoxic  or anaerobic conditions. each of these genes showed some increase in expression already at  <dig> % o <dig>  hxt <dig> also had higher transcript levels in anaerobic conditions compared to the hypoxic conditions of  <dig>  and  <dig> % o <dig>  hxt <dig>  hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> had higher expression in  <dig> % o <dig> and fully aerobic conditions compared to lower oxygen levels, whereas hxt <dig> had higher expression at 1% or more o <dig>  the signals from hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and combined hxt <dig> and hxt <dig>  were higher in at least two out of three hypoxic conditions than in either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. the highest transcript levels of hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> were seen in  <dig> % o <dig>  whereas the expression of hxt15/ <dig> was reduced at this level of oxygen provision. hxt <dig> had similar high expression in  <dig> and  <dig> % o <dig>  none of the hexose transporter genes were upregulated in anaerobic compared to aerobic conditions. the signal for the gene encoding the snf3p sensor was higher in aerobic compared to anaerobic conditions, and highest in  <dig> % o <dig>  whereas the signal of the rgt <dig> transcripts was lowest under the hypoxic conditions of  <dig>  and 1% o <dig> 

expression of transporter encoding genes after a change between aerobic and anaerobic conditions
the expression of hexose transporter and glucose sensor genes following a change in oxygen provision was studied by switching oxygen provision off or on, in aerobic and anaerobic cultivations, respectively. following the change from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, samples were taken until a new steady state was achieved . after the switch from anaerobic to aerobic conditions, the cultivations started to oscillate after  <dig> hours and the steady state could not be reached. the results are thus reported only for the first  <dig> hours .

clear changes as a response to the removal of oxygen from respiratory cells were seen in the transcript levels of hxt <dig> to hxt <dig>  although the time scales of the responses varied . two of these genes  were upregulated and four  downregulated either transiently or permanently as a response to lack of oxygen. the transcript levels of hxt <dig>  hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> had changed already during the first  <dig> minutes, while a response in hxt <dig> expression was seen only after  <dig> min but within one hour. changes observed in hxt <dig> expression were the slowest to occur; a significant response was seen after  <dig> hours.

when oxygen was introduced to the anaerobic cultivations , two of the genes encoding major hexose transporters  were downregulated and two  were upregulated. hxt <dig> was upregulated only after a transient downregulation during the first  <dig> hours after oxygen was provided. hxt <dig> was slightly upregulated after initial  downregulation. expression of hxt <dig>  hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> exhibited rapid responses to a change in environmental oxygen, i.e within  <dig> min, the earliest sample taken after the change.

the responses of the transporter genes hxt <dig> to hxt <dig> were weaker than those of the major hexose transporters . in general, these genes were upregulated when oxygen was introduced to anaerobic cultivations, and either downregulated or did not respond when oxygen was removed from aerobic cultures. the expression of hxt15/ <dig>  increased only transiently when the culture was adapting to aerobic conditions and permanently following the shift to anaerobic conditions. of the sensor genes, expression of snf <dig> was not affected by change in the oxygen concentration, but rgt <dig> was downregulated when the cultures experienced lack of oxygen.

expression of transporter encoding genes after a change between hypoxic and anaerobic conditions
the response in expression of hxt and glucose sensor genes was also assessed following a shift from hypoxic  to anaerobic and from anaerobic to hypoxic conditions. samples were taken until a new steady state was achieved.

the response in the expression of the hexose transporter encoding genes to oxygen depletion was different when the starting point was hypoxic and not fully aerobic . when oxygen was replaced with nitrogen in the cultures which had been hypoxic, most of the hxt genes were downregulated . the expression of hxt <dig>  hxt <dig>  hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and hxt15/ <dig> was transiently upregulated in cells after  <dig> min in anaerobic conditions, but downregulated already after  <dig> min. only hxt <dig> was transiently upregulated for a longer period . hxt <dig> was upregulated towards the end of the adaptation to the anaerobic conditions, around  <dig> hours after oxygen was depleted.

when hypoxic conditions were introduced to anaerobic cultivations  the immediate  responses were similar to those observed when fully aerobic conditions were introduced , but the subsequent responses differed. only the expression of hxt <dig>  hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and hxt15/ <dig> changed significantly as the cells approached the hypoxic steady state. hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and hxt15/ <dig> were upregulated whereas hxt <dig> was downregulated. hxt <dig> and rgt <dig> were transiently downregulated during the first  <dig> and 2– <dig> hours, respectively, following the switch to hypoxic conditions.

promoter analysis of the hxt genes induced in hypoxic conditions
the promoter regions  of the genes encoding hxt3p, hxt6p, hxt13p, and hxt15/16p transporters were sequenced in the cen.pk113-1a strain. the upstream sequences of hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and hxt15/ <dig> were identical to those of strain s288c, whose genomic sequence is found in the data banks. in the promoter region of hxt <dig> there were five separate nucleotides in cen.pk113-1a that differed from the published sequence of strain s288c. the dna pattern  <cit>  web-based tool was used to search the promoters of hxt <dig>  hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and hxt15/ <dig> for binding sites of transcription factors known to be involved in hypoxic control. these were lore ; 5' actcaacaa 3'  <cit>  and hre ; 5' brcgtgvbbb 3'  <cit> . two lore sequences were found in the hxt <dig> promoter and one in the hxt15/ <dig> promoter , whereas one hre site was found in the hxt <dig> promoter of both s288c and cen.pk113-1a strains.

discussion
most of the published data indicate that the expression of the hexose transporter encoding genes of s. cerevisiae is mainly regulated by extracellular glucose concentration. in the present paper, the expression of these genes was studied under various oxygen concentrations in glucose-limited chemostats with an extracellular glucose concentration below detection limit and thus not affecting the transcription of hxt genes  <cit> . when oxygen becomes limiting in a glucose-limited chemostat cultivation, the glucose uptake rate per cell increases. we addressed the question of how the expression level of hexose transporter encoding genes is modified as a result of increased specific glucose consumption rate under oxygen restricted conditions.

in aerobic glucose-limited chemostat cultures grown at a dilution rate of  <dig>  h- <dig>  both high and moderately low affinity glucose uptake is detected  <cit> . a similar result was observed here; expression of the moderately low affinity transporter genes hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> and of the high affinity transporter genes hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> was seen. expression of hxt <dig> and hxt <dig>  encoding low affinity transporters was also detected, but on a very low level. in their chemostat study, diderich and co-workers  <cit>  only detected the expression of hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and hxt <dig>  this is most probably due to differences in the sensitivity of the techniques used. we were also able to detect the expression of all other hexose transporter genes except hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and gal <dig>  although some were only expressed at a very low level.

in anaerobic conditions, the expression of hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and hxt <dig>  encoding moderately low affinity transporters was significantly reduced compared to aerobic conditions . this was also seen during transition from aerobic or hypoxic growth to anaerobic growth and agrees with earlier studies which detected only high affinity transport activity in anaerobic glucose-limited chemostat cultivations  <cit> . in addition to the decreased expression levels of the moderately low affinity transporter encoding genes, the activity of hxt2p may be modulated towards higher affinity, as both high and moderately low affinity components have been observed in a strain expressing only this transporter gene  <cit> .

interestingly, the expression of none of the hexose transporter encoding genes was increased in anaerobic compared to aerobic conditions. however, the decrease in the moderately low affinity uptake may result in a relative increase in high affinity uptake, which may allow the higher specific glucose consumption rate to occur in anaerobic conditions. in contrast, trhxt <dig>  encoding a glucose transporter, is induced by anoxia but not by hypoxia in the filamentous fungus trichoderma reesei  <cit> . this may represent a difference between facultative anaerobic and strictly aerobic fungi.

earlier studies have shown that hxt <dig> is expressed at a higher level in aerobic than in anaerobic conditions  <cit> . our studies show that the transcription of hxt <dig> was significantly reduced not only in anaerobic, but also in hypoxic, compared to aerobic conditions. in addition, the regulation of hxt <dig> following a change in oxygen provision differed from that of other hxt genes. when hypoxic condition became anaerobic, there was a long , transient upregulation of expression of this gene, that was opposite to the final response of downregulation. it is known that the transcription of hxt <dig> is not regulated by extracellular glucose concentration, but by growth rate, and that the expression is under the control of stre and hap elements in its promoter  <cit> . the reduction in specific growth rate for up to  <dig> h following a shift from hypoxic to anaerobic conditions may have contributed to the transient upregulation of hxt <dig>  but it should be noted that transient upregulation was not observed following the change from aerobic to anaerobic conditions even though the specific growth rate was similarly reduced. hap2/3/4/5p elements are needed for the induction of transcription of respiratory genes, like the ones encoding the subunits of cytochrome c oxidase  and enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle   <cit> . these elements are also likely to be involved in the aerobic induction of hxt <dig> seen in this study.

the change in specific growth rate after a change in oxygen provision may also have affected the expression of other hexose transporter encoding genes, directly or inderectly. however, responses to increased oxygen provision  which occurred within less than  <dig> hours were independent of specific growth rate, which only increased after this time. further, specific growth rate increased  <dig> hours after a change to either  <dig>  or  <dig> % oxygen, but for those genes whose transcription was affected by the change between  <dig> and  <dig> hours after it occurred, during which time the specific growth rate was increased, the response was generally not the same with  <dig>  as with  <dig> % oxygen. thus it is unlikely that the increase in specific growth rate contributed as much as the increase in oxygen availability in regulation of the hexose transport genes. the decrease in specific growth rate which occurred following a change to anaerobic conditions was also unlikely to be as important as the reduction in oxygen availability in affecting transcription of the hexose transport genes, since a similar reduction in specific growth rate was observed regardless of the initial concentration of oxygen provided, but changes in gene transcription were dependent on the initial oxygen provision.

in hypoxic  conditions, the expression of four of the hxt genes was higher than in aerobic conditions. even with  <dig> % oxygen, compared to aerobic conditions, the expression of hxt <dig>  hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and hxt15/ <dig> was higher, whereas the expression of hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> was lower. in our earlier study we observed that the expression levels of 50% of the  <dig> genes of central carbon metabolism which were studied were different under  <dig> % oxygen provision compared to full aeration  <cit> , suggesting that the cell is able to recognise the reduced oxygen level, even though the cultures still maintain a high biomass concentration and a high oxygen uptake rate. reduced transcript levels of hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> and increased transcript levels of hxt <dig> have previously been observed during respiro-fermentative metabolism at high dilution rates in chemostat cultures  <cit> .

the expression of the high affinity transporter encoding gene hxt <dig> was relatively strong in all the hypoxic oxygen levels studied compared to aerobic or anaerobic conditions. this was seen in both steady state and non-steady state cultures. in contrast, the expression of the other high affinity transporter encoding gene, hxt <dig> was very similar in aerobic cultivations and in those receiving  <dig> % oxygen and was low in cultures with less or no oxygen, especially in the culture receiving  <dig> % oxygen. this observation agrees with the earlier observation that even though hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> are 99% identical in their coding regions, they are not co-regulated  <cit>  indeed, their promoter regions are only 51% identical.

hxt <dig> and hxt15/ <dig> exhibited their highest relative expression in hypoxic steady states and also showed clear responses to a shift in oxygen concentration. these genes were induced when hypoxia was introduced after anaerobic conditions and repressed when hypoxic cultivations became anaerobic. the transient responses following shifts between fully aerobic and anaerobic conditions were smaller, reflecting the comparable expression level of these two genes under the two conditions. hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> have previously been shown to be slightly induced by non-fermentable carbon sources  <cit> . in the promoter regions of hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> there are lore   <cit>  sequences with one mismatch to the consensus. these elements could be responsible for the induction in the hypoxic conditions, although the site is located - <dig> bp from the start codon of the genes. the promoter of hxt <dig>  on the other hand, contains an hre  sequence, which is responsible for the regulation of hypoxic genes in mammalian cells   <cit> . it has recently been speculated that this element is also present in the yeast genome  <cit> .

only small differences in the expression levels of hxt <dig>  hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> were seen, either between different steady states or as a response to a change in oxygen concentration. in addition to regulation by glucose concentration , the expression levels are known to be affected by change in ph , and hxt <dig> has been indicated to be involved in multidrug resistance  <cit> .

most of the hxt genes had different expression in different oxygen concentrations, either during the steady states or following a change between anaerobic and hypoxic or aerobic conditions. transcription of hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and hxt <dig> was high in aerobic and that of hxt <dig>  hxt <dig> and hxt15/ <dig> was high in hypoxic conditions. additionally, the three former transporter encoding genes clearly had lower expression levels in oxygen-restricted conditions. however, questions concerning the significance of the hypoxic induction, and why the moderately low affinity transporters are expressed in glucose-limited chemostats with very low extracellular glucose concentration, remain to be addressed in future studies. it is tempting to speculate, that the hypoxic induction of expression, in particular that of hxt <dig>  encoding a known high affinity transporter, indicates a response to enhance sugar uptake upon oxygen limitation. the fact that the relative transcript levels of this gene are lower in fully anaerobic compared to hypoxic cultures may not represent the situation at the protein level on the plasma membrane. the decreased amount of moderately low affinity transporters, achieved by both regulating the expression of these genes and by degradation of the respective protein, under conditions of low oxygen may provide additional membrane space for the high affinity transporters to occupy the membrane and thus increase the glucose uptake rate.

CONCLUSIONS
the expression of hexose transporter encoding genes was affected by change in oxygen provision. the expression of genes encoding moderately low affinity transporters was lower in anaerobic than aerobic conditions. as the expression of none of the hexose transporter encoding genes was increased in anaerobic compared to aerobic conditions it seems that the decrease in the moderately low affinity uptake and consequently the relative increase of high affinity uptake may itself allow a higher specific glucose consumption rate to occur in oxygen restricted and anaerobic conditions. further, the gene encoding the high affinity transporter hxt6p and the genes encoding hxt13p and hxt15/16p were upregulated in hypoxic conditions, and the expression of moderately low affinity transporters, particularly that of hxt <dig>  was reduced with only  <dig> % oxygen compared to fully aerobic conditions. the regulation of hexose transporter encoding genes is thus different in oxygen restricted conditions compared to fully anaerobic conditions.
