BACKGROUND
in terms of tonnage, world-wide production of barley ranks fourth among cultivated cereals. more than 60% of the barley produced is used by the brewing industry. barley seed germination is the foundation of malting and brewing industry. hence it is not surprising that barley has evolved as a model for seed germination research. the total protein content in barley seed varies between  <dig> and 15%  <cit> . the amount and composition of barley proteins influence the suitability and quality of grain for its end uses, with approximately a third of the proteins being present in the final beer  <cit> .

hordeins, the storage proteins in barley, account for nearly 80% of the total proteins  <cit> . two- dimension gel electrophoresis  was used to separate barley seed proteins . seed tissue sub-proteomes including plasma membrane, endosperm, embryo, and aleurone layer have been analyzed using 2-de combined with mass spectrometry which led to the identification of hundreds of proteins  <cit> . some of the recent advances in the proteomics field such as shotgun proteomics have not been explored in barley. in shot gun proteomics , complex peptide fractions generated after protein proteolytic digestion can be resolved using different fractionation strategies, which offer high-throughput analyses of the proteome of an organ, organelle or a cell type, and provide a snapshot of the major protein constituents  <cit> . one of the recent trends in shotgun proteomics is the use of label-free methods for protein quantitation  <cit> . a number of reports on the use of gel-free label-free quantitative proteomics have been conducted in plants including arabidopsis  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , soybeans  <cit> , barley  <cit>  and corn  <cit> .

wild barley, hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum, the progenitor of cultivated barley has two-rows of seeds  in each head . a single recessive gene, vrs <dig>  has been shown to cause the six-row phenotype  <cit> . morphologically, two-row barley kernels tend to be symmetrical, while six-row barley has symmetrical center but lateral rows are shorter, thinner and slightly twisted . intuitively, a six-rowed spike can stably produce three times the usual grain number compared to a two-rowed type and hence may have been selected by plant breeders. from a brewers’ view-point, six-row barley may be less desirable compared to a two-row owing to non-uniformity of the seed size of the former. furthermore, six-row barley tend to have more protein content and hence less starch than the latter  <cit> . through rigorous breeding efforts a number of two-row and six-row barley cultivars with desirable malting quality and disease resistance traits have been commercialized. however, the differences in the protein constituents between six-row and two-row barley seeds have not been investigated. in this study a shot gun proteomics strategy was employed in order to provide a deeper characterization of the barley seed proteome. spectral counting analysis was undertaken to identify differentially abundant proteins in the seeds of two-rowed conrad and six-rowed lacey barley cultivars.

RESULTS
mature dry seeds of barley are the primary raw materials for the malting and brewing industry. in this study we undertook a deep proteome analysis of the fully matured dry seeds of the two-row, conrad and six-row, lacey cultivar. averaging the triplicate peptide profiles from these two lines generated  <dig>  spectra that could be mapped to  <dig> proteins with unique uniprot identifiers. eleven of these protein sequences showed matches to the decoy database. this indicates that the false discovery rate in the current study is  <dig> %. six proteins that were identified as keratin  or trypsin  were removed from the analysis, thus giving a set of  <dig> proteins for further detailed analysis. using a similar nanolc ms/ms strategy for seed proteome analysis,  <dig> non-redundant proteins were reported for soybeans  <cit>  and  <dig> for quinoa  <cit> . this 3– <dig> fold higher number of seed proteins identified in our analysis indicates that the seed protein extraction, digestion and nanolc ms/ms analysis were superior to those reported for soybeans  <cit>  and quinoa  <cit> . in one of the most comprehensive proteome exploration studies using multidimensional protein identification technology ,  <dig> seed proteins were reported in rice  <cit> . recently, deep proteome analysis of the gerantoplasts from the inner integuments of the developing seeds of jatropha curcas using an in-solution digestion followed by lc ms/ms identified  <dig> proteins  <cit> . a comparison of the seed proteomes of the various opaque mutants of maize identified nearly  <dig> proteins using the lc ms/ms strategy  <cit> . thus the number of proteins identified in the current study is comparable to other deep proteome studies in the recently published literature.

protein profiling studies in barley were conducted even before the inception of the concept of proteomics  <cit> . nearly  <dig> different studies have been reported on barley seed proteome analysis using the 2de coupled with the maldi-tof peptide mass fingerprinting and/or mass spectrometry. information provided in these aforementioned studies, especially protein descriptions, molecular weight and isoelectric point , were used to compare with the results from the current study . nearly 85%  of the proteins reported in the earlier studies  were identified in this analysis. a comparison between the 2de and a gel-free mudpit analysis in rice indicated that about 29% of the proteins identified were unique to the former, suggesting that inclusion of two different techniques can be complementary and provide a more comprehensive proteome coverage  <cit> . the comparative analysis undertaken here indicates 15% of the proteins were unique to the 2de technique and begs the question of identity of those proteins. an obvious case in point relates to the study of barley peroxidases  <cit>  . the three reported peroxidases in the european cultivar sloop were not present in the two american cultivars used in this study. in the current study six different peroxidases were identified, but based on their theoretical pi and mw none of them seem to be close to those reported earlier  <cit> . thus some of the proteins may be unique to the cultivars investigated. other commonly missing proteins in the current study compared with studies summarized in table  <dig> included barwin, small heat shock proteins, cold regulated protein, and isoflavone reductase. these stress response proteins may be influenced by the environment in which the plants were grown and conditions during seed set.table  <dig> overlap between protein identification from other barley seed proteome studies compared with the current study




in one of the earlier seed proteome studies, plasma membrane proteins from barley aleurone were enriched using reverse-phase chromatography, sds-page and lc-ms/ms  <cit> . of the  <dig> proteins with trans-membrane  domains,  <dig> were identified in our analysis. using the barley uniprot identifiers, the information for tm domain  was retrieved from the uniportkb database and identified  <dig> proteins with one or more tm domains . this suggests that the methodology used for the protein extraction in the current study is compatible even for the more tenacious membrane proteins.

the grand average of hydropathicity  index for the  <dig> proteins identified in this study was compared using the histogram function in excel . proteins with negative gravy scores are hydrophilic and those with positive values are hydrophobic. the majority of proteins had a gravy score ranging between − <dig>  and  <dig>  indicating that most of them are hydrophilic. the asymmetric distribution of the gravy values  confirmed the left-heavy tails of the distribution. a similar distribution of the proteins in rice seeds was reported  <cit> . the tendency of the barley seed proteome for hydrophilicity suggests that these water soluble proteins may be active in physiological processes during imbibition and subsequently during germination.fig.  <dig> distribution of barley seed proteins based on their hydropathicity. full-length protein sequences were used to calculate the grand average of hydropathicity . negative values indicate hydrophilic proteins and positive values indicate hydrophobic proteins. histogram was generated using ms excel




traditional proteomics strategies such as 2de are conducted to examine particular groups of proteins based on their solubility or pi etc. for example, soluble seed proteins were extracted using a weak buffer at neutral ph since many of the well-studied seed proteins  were isolated under these conditions and minimized the extraction of seed storage proteins that would otherwise dominate the 2-de profile and mask the lower abundance proteins  <cit> . the use of extraction buffer containing tris–hcl and kcl in the current study was not favorable for solubilizing the abundant seed storage proteins like hordeins. this in turn favored the identification of lower abundance proteins. another strategy for proteome analysis was to separate proteins by focusing them for a defined pi range  <cit> . using the top-down proteomics strategy described here, the theoretical pi values of the  <dig> proteins ranged from 4– <dig> . the pi value distribution showed a bi-modal pattern with the majority of the seed proteins in the 4– <dig> range. nearly  <dig> proteins were in the  <dig> – <dig> pi range. a second peak was observed in the alkaline pi range with more than  <dig> proteins with a pi of  <dig> – <dig>  this unbiased technique  thus enabled a deeper analysis of the seed proteome.fig.  <dig> distribution of barley seed proteins based on their isolectric points. theoretical pi values of the proteins were obtained from the uniprot database. the pi values were binned into  <dig>  units and histogram was generated using ms excel




for the  <dig> unique proteins of barley in the uniprotkb database, meaningful annotations were available for only about  <dig> proteins . uncharacterized proteins comprised about 60%  of the seed proteome while the remaining 19%  of the proteome comprised of predicted proteins. to improve the annotations, barley uniref identifiers were mapped to the uniref <dig> and uniref <dig> data sets. the  <dig> barley uniprot identifiers mapped to  <dig> entries from the uniref <dig> database and  <dig> entries in the uniref <dig> database. using the mapping information to the uniref <dig> and uniref <dig> databases, we manually added descriptions for nearly  <dig> proteins .

identified seed proteins were classified by gene ontology  terms in three broad domains – biological process, cellular component and molecular function. about  <dig> proteins were associated with one or more go terms, while  <dig> proteins did not have any go annotations. in the molecular function category,  <dig> proteins were associated with  <dig> gos. in the biological process category,  <dig> proteins were associated with  <dig> go terms, and the cellular compartment or localization category,  <dig> proteins were associated with  <dig> go terms. the large number of go terms is attributed to the differences in the amount of information available for some of the well characterized proteins with detailed annotations. a careful analysis of the go terms showed that the number of unique go identifiers were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for the domains of biological process, molecular function and cellular compartment, respectively. to further reduce this complexity and provide an easy visual of the major go terms associated with the seed proteome, the categorizer program was used  <cit> . in conjunction with the plant go slim terms as the background, this analysis indicated that there were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> go terms associated with the biological process, molecular function and cellular compartment, respectively . nearly a quarter of the proteome was associated with metabolic processes , 18% of the proteins were associated with biosynthetic processes and about 12% were related to proteins responsive to stress. while proteins associated with translation were identified in the seed proteome, we did not identify many proteins associated with transcriptional machinery. this is consistent with earlier reports that the dry seeds accumulate translatable rna  that is produced during seed development  <cit>  and that de novo transcription is not essential for early stages of seed germination  <cit> .fig.  <dig> pie charts of gene ontologies  of the barley seed proteins. for each of the go categories only terms with more than 2% of the total were included for this analysis. the numbers on the chart represent the percentage of proteins in each go category




go enrichment analysis
identifying enriched gos among the seed proteins aids in determining key biological processes, vital molecular functions and organelles within seeds in which these proteins localize. since detailed annotations for many of the genes in the barley genome were not available, rice orthologs of the barley seed proteins were identified. a total of  <dig> rice proteins matching barley  were retrieved by blast analysis. among these,  <dig> unique tigr gene identifiers were retrieved and these proteins had detailed go annotations. these unique rice proteins were subjected to singular enrichment analysis  in agrigo to identify enriched gos  <cit> . this analysis is designed to identify enriched go terms in a list of probe sets or gene identifiers. finding enriched go terms corresponds to finding enriched biological facts, and term enrichment level is judged by comparing the query list to a background population  from which the query list is derived. a total of  <dig> enriched go terms were identified, of which  <dig> were associated with biological processes,  <dig> with molecular function and  <dig> with cellular component .

consistent with the go analysis, proteins associated with metabolism were enriched and  <dig> proteins in particular associated with carbohydrate metabolism . among the  <dig> proteins associated with the amino acid metabolic process,  <dig>  of them were involved in various amino acid biosynthetic pathways and the remainder  <dig> were proteins associated with aminoacyl trna synthase activity. all the  <dig> proteins associated with cellular homeostasis were in fact important in redox regulation, further supporting the recent findings about the role of reactive oxygen species in seed dormancy and germination  <cit> . more than  <dig> proteins were associated with translation and nearly 60% of these proteins were structural components of the ribosome machinery. one of the interesting enriched go terms was transport that included  <dig> proteins involved in intracellular trafficking, signal recognition particle, transport of metal ions, lipids, and nutrients. among the  <dig> proteins involved in the generation of precursor metabolites and energy, the majority of them were associated with glycolysis, tricaboxylic acid cycle or gluconeogenesis.fig.  <dig> gene ontology enrichment analysis of barley seed proteins using agrigo. each box shows the go term number, the p-value in parenthesis, go term. the first pair of numerals represents the number of proteins in the input list associated with that go term and the number of proteins in the input list. the second pair of numerals represents the number of proteins associated with the particular go term in the rice database and the total number of rice proteins with go annotations in the rice database. the box colors indicate levels of statistical significance with yellow =  <dig> ; orange = e- <dig> and red = e- <dig>  dotted arrows indicate two or more significant nodes, and dashed arrows indicate one significant node




the enriched go terms associated with molecular function were considerably fewer compared with the biological processes . of the  <dig> proteins associated with nucleoside-triphosphatase activity,  <dig> proteins had gtpase activity. among the  <dig> proteins with transferase activity,  <dig> proteins were kinases suggesting that phosphorylation of seed proteins may play an important role during the transition from quiescence to imbibition and germination in barley. the importance of phosphorylation during seed imbibition and germination has been demonstrated in maize  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and oak  <cit> . the three major steps of protein synthesis namely – initiation, elongation and termination were represented in the seed proteome. of the  <dig> proteins associated with translation factor activity, nine were associated with initiation, eight proteins were elongation factors, while one protein had translation termination activity.

the cellular component go enrichment terms were consistent with the major go categories that were identified using the barley identifiers . the largest number of proteins were localized to the cytoplasm  while nuclear proteins were not significantly enriched in the seed proteome. this again indicates that the vast majority of the seed proteome consists of soluble proteins consistent with the hydropathicity profile described earlier. interestingly, the second largest group of  <dig> proteins were associated with plasma membrane, and may be involved in the process of protein mobilization during germination  <cit> . the third largest group of  <dig> proteins were associated with ribosomes, further confirming the importance of protein translation in seeds.

differences in two-row versus six-row barley seed proteome
spectral counting is based on the rationale that peptides from more abundant proteins will be selected more frequently for fragmentation and will thus produce a higher number of ms/ms spectra. thus, the number of ms/ms scans is tabulated, and the protein abundance is inferred from the total number of ms/ms spectra that match peptides from the protein  <cit> . spectral counting is becoming popular in label-free quantification due to its simple procedure that does not require chromatographic peak integration or retention time alignment  <cit> .

in this study we examined the differentially abundant proteins in the two-rowed conrad when compared with the six-rowed lacey seed samples. differential expression was based on statistical significance of the averaged differences in the spectral counts between the two cultivars . it should be noted that the overall seed protein profiles as observed on a one-dimensional sds-page was similar for the two cultivars . of the  <dig> proteins,  <dig> proteins differed in their abundances between the two cultivars . eleven of these proteins were in higher abundance in lacey and nine of them in conrad. it is interesting to note that two different sucrose synthase proteins showed opposite patterns of abundance in the two cultivars. the gene encoding the larger proteins ss <dig> is localized to chromosome  <dig>  and the gene for the homologous shorter version, ss <dig>  is on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . both of these proteins are more abundant in the endosperm tissues than in aleurone layer  <cit> . however, the biological significance of their differential abundance in the two-rowed conrad versus the six-rowed lacey is not clear.table  <dig> differentially abundant proteins between two-rowed conrad and six-rowed lacey cultivars based on spectral counting analysis




it was reported that milling energy, another measure of grain hardness, correlates negatively with malting quality in barley  <cit> . therefore, the development of softer cultivars may benefit malting quality traits. hordoindolines are proteins homologous to the puroindolines of wheat, which are important for determining the grain hardiness  and endosperm texture  <cit> . in barley there are three hordoindolines – hin-a, hin-b <dig> and hin-b <dig>  <cit> . in this study we found a significantly higher level of hin-a and hin-b <dig> in conrad, while the levels of hin-b <dig> were higher in lacey . on the contrary, hin-a and hin-b <dig> protein abundances did not vary in two-rowed shikaku hakada and six-rowed ichibanboshi cultivars  <cit>  leading the authors to conclude that these two protein isoforms were not important for determining grain hardness. hin-b <dig> protein, particularly hinb-2b, was reported by these authors as important contributors for grain hardness. lines with the hinb-2b alleles showed much higher average hardness index   than those with the hinb-2a alleles  in f <dig> lines from the cross between shikoku hadaka  <dig>  and shikoku hadaka  <dig>   <cit> . the ms peptide sequence data indicates that both conrad and lacey have hina-b/hinb-1a/hinb-2a alleles. hardness index calculated using the single kernel characterization system  analysis showed a significantly higher value for conrad compared to lacey . the difference in the seed hardness values between the six-rowed lacey and two-rowed conrad was about  <dig> units, similar to the difference reported in the f <dig> lines  <cit> . based on these contradictory data we speculate that developing protein markers  for hordoindolines may provide a more reliable screen for the grain hardness trait in barley.fig.  <dig> spectral count analysis of the barley hardoindoline proteins in the seeds of two-rowed conrad and six-rowed lacey cultivar. the number of spectra for hin-a, hin-b <dig> and hin-b <dig> for conrad and lacey cultivars from three biological replicates are shown here





CONCLUSIONS
in this study a deep proteome analysis of barley seeds was undertaken using shotgun nano hplc ms/ms. more than  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins identified were annotated as ‘uncharacterized proteins’ or ‘predicted proteins’, suggesting that curation of barley genes needs a significant improvement. identifying the orthologous proteins from the well-curated rice genome aided in conducting go enrichment analysis. the comparative proteomics analysis between the six-rowed and two-rowed barley cultivars indicated only  <dig> proteins were differentially abundant between the two cultivars. variation in the abundances of hordoindoline proteins was one of the key differences between the two-rowed conrad and six-rowed lacey. the type of hordoindoline proteins may contribute to the differences between the seed hardness of these two cultivars. this suggests that differences in protein profiles can provide a useful tool for examining more complex traits such as malting quality. efforts are underway toward using this technique during various stages of malt production for identifying novel protein markers for predicting barley malting quality.
