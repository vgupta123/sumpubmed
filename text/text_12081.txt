BACKGROUND
recent advances in sequencing genomes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes  <cit>  and the explosion of the development and use of genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions  <cit>  are expected to facilitate the selection of targets for metabolic engineering  <cit> ] . the unicellular green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been an attractive organism for exploration of metabolic engineering hypotheses due to its capability to flexibly regulate alternative biochemical pathways to produce biofuels  <cit> . however, the optimal selection of the enzymatic targets has been so far hindered by the lack of a comprehensive knowledge of the encoded genes that carry out the metabolic activities of the organism. although the released genome sequence of c. renihardtii by the joint genome institute   <cit>  provided the needed resource to predict nearly  <dig>  genes in this organism, it alone does not reveal the underlying principles of metabolic network function, nor does it disclose the functions of the predicted “parts-list” of the organism. to define genes and map their products to function, computational algorithms have been extensively applied to annotate the accumulated genomic data from many organisms including c. reinhartii <cit> . most of these approaches are unable to predict the transcript structures precisely and accurately in a uniform manner due to 1) the incompleteness of the est data, 2) the lack of comparative genomic information, particularly in less widely studied species, and 3) the complexity of the rules governing transcription initiation, termination and splicing events. even for the well-studied nematode c. elegans, for which a high quality genome sequence has been available for over  <dig> years, inconsistencies still remain in defining the orf structures  <cit> ]. previous large-scale studies on c. reinhardtii, have included microarray  <cit> ], proteomics  <cit> , and, more recently, rnaseq experiments  <cit>  which have provided valuable expression data based on earlier releases of jgi annotations. currently, the jgi v <dig>  predicted c. reinhardtii orfeome remains for the most part unverified; therefore, the functional annotation and experimental structural verification of the encoded orfs are urgently needed prior to use in functional studies including metabolic engineering experiments.

we previously reported the functional annotation of the gene products involved in central metabolism of c. reinhardtii using jgi v <dig>  gene models  <cit>  in which we improved the existing functional and structural annotations of the orf models. in the re-evaluation of the central metabolic orfs, for which the orfs are generally the best characterized in the proteome, we observed that as much as 10% of the orfs were annotated with structuralerrors. the errors included incorrect 5’ or 3’ boundary annotations, which we identified through race  <cit> .

in this study, we computationally assigned enzyme functions to the predicted and newly released jgi v <dig>  protein-coding orf models and targeted the enzymatic orfeome for structural verification. our results, in addition to structural verification, provide expression evidence for the enzymatic gene products, predict their subcellular localization, and identify the orf models that may need to be re-annotated.

RESULTS
functional annotation of jgi v <dig>  transcripts
we used the new jgi “filtered transcript models” released through the jgi portal  for both functional assignments and structural annotation verifications. enzymatic functional assignments to the c. reinhardtii orfs were made by associating enzyme commission  numbers through reciprocal blast searches against the uniprot enzyme database  <cit>    supplemented with aracyc database entries  <cit>  . the best match for each translated orf was identified  and the ec number from the uniprot best match  was transferred on to the jgi predicted orf. we extended the ec assignments to the respective paralogs of the orfs by clustering orfs for the jgi filtered models. altogether, we were able to assign  <dig> ec numbers to  <dig>  jgi orfs . kegg currently provides  <dig> enzymatic annotations for the jgi v <dig>  transcripts, of which there are  <dig> shared with our annotation. theassignments given in this study provide an additional  <dig> ec numbers not present in kegg. the list of the enzymatic jgi v <dig>  gene models with their assigned ec numbers are provided in additional file  <dig> 

in order to provide additional functional information, wolf psort  <cit>  was implemented to assign subcellular localizations to each translated jgi v <dig>  enzymatic orf. wolf psort is a high-performance localization prediction algorithm evolved from psort  <cit>  , psort ii  <cit>  and ipsort  <cit> ; it combines localization features from these algorithms together with amino acid composition in a weighted k-nearest neighbors framework. based on the cross-validation results, wolf psort makes reliable predictions for nucleus, mitochondria, cytosol, plasma membrane, extracellular and  chloroplast. for other subcellular compartments, the performance is not as good, but still informative  <cit>  . compared to other methods, wolf psort has been shown to have good performance for most subcellular localizations  <cit> . importantly, predictions are not made on the basis of signal sequences that can introduce vulnerability to errors in sequence and/or annotations on the 5' end of the gene  <cit> . furthermore, due to the unique phylogenetic position of c. reinhardtii and a lack of extensive go annotation, alternative methods such as multiloc <dig>  <cit> , which use go annotation for refinement of predictions, would not be applicable here.

the results  are presented as the number of nearest neighbors in different subcellular compartments for each protein. the default value for the total number of nearest neighbors  is  <dig>  even though c. reinhardtii is in the plant lineage, it has retained key animal genes  <cit>  and is a unicellular organism that shares ancestry at the branching point of plants and animals. we therefore performed two wolf psort runs in which c. reinhardtii was considered either as a plant or animal. because c. reinhardtii is closer to plants than animals  <cit> , predictions made when considering it as a plant are likely to be more accurate. however, because wolf psort uses homology to known proteins, and some c. reinhardtii proteins may be closer to those in animals than plants  <cit> , the predictions assuming an animal lineage provide alternative assignments, particularly for cases where ambiguous predictions are made for the proteins assuming plant origins. to summarize the obtained results , we have binned the encoded proteins based on the assigned probability values for each protein, such that, if more than 50% of the nearest neighbors of the protein belong to a given compartment, that protein is assigned to a single compartment as its primary localization site. in cases where different localization predictions made based on animal and plant assumptions both meet an 85% cutoff, we took the higher confidence prediction as the final localization assignment . using this integration scheme, the largest compartment is the chloroplast when c. reinhardtii is considered a plant, and the second largest is the mitochondrion . these localization predictions agree with the fact that these genes are all related to metabolism. to verify the performance of our predictions, we manually curated a number of experimentally derived c. reinhardtii subcellular protein localizations recently reported by weinkoop et al. <cit> . due to the limited number of localizations that could be transferred to v <dig>  annotations from this study, we were only able to evaluate  <dig> orfs in our set. our predicted localizations of all  <dig> orfs agreed with the experimentally determined localizations. although the number is too small for adequate statistical analysis, it still shows the high quality of the predictions.

experimental verification of c. reinhardtii enzymatic orfeome
our ec annotation of the jgi v <dig>  transcript models identified  <dig>  predicted transcripts with putative enzymatic functions. to experimentally verify structural annotation of the enzymatic orfs, we carried out targeted transcriptome sequencing experiments after we amplified the orfs by reverse transcription-pcr  . the generated amplicons were sequenced using the 454flx platform before and after cloning of the amplicons into a gateway vector. the sequences of the clones were further verified by conventional sanger sequencing.

in order to perform the verification experiments, we grew c. reinhardtii under permissive condition by providing light, organic carbon sources and other nutrients . total rna from cells undergoing exponential growth was isolated and reverse transcribed to serve as a template for amplification of the orfs for which we designed gateway-tailed primers. following amplification, we carried out next generation sequencing  of the amplicons. the obtained  <dig> reads were then aligned to the jgi v <dig>  orf reference sequences to assess annotation accuracy. the aligned orfs were binned according to their percent coverage; i.e., based on the percentage of the entire length of the orf reference sequence that could be covered by the contigs assembled from the  <dig> reads.

for 78% of the jgi v <dig>  orf reference sequences, the  <dig> reads provided 95-100% coverage , of this set approximately 92% had a coverage rate of 99-100%, demonstrating high verification rates. approximately 10% of the orf models showed coverage of 50-95%. the remaining 12% were covered less than 50% and of this set, 7% of the orf models had less than 20% of their length verified by 454-reads.

as an alternative method of verifying the orfs, we end-sequenced the cloned pcr products by conventional high-throughput sanger sequencing. from  <dig>  jgi v <dig>  orfs tested, we were able to obtain  <dig> orf sequence tags  that were aligned to the 5’ end of the orf models, and  <dig> osts that could be aligned to the 3’ ends. altogether, 42%  orfs had osts that verified both ends of the orf models. we could assemble full-length contigs for  <dig> orfs .

overall, we obtained expression evidence for  <dig>  of  <dig>  orf models with assigned enzymatic functions based on targeted transcriptome sequencing results and sequencing of the clones, though clearly not all of these orf models can be considered verified. we consider an orf model to be verified if  <dig> to 100% of its reference sequence could be covered by 454-reads, or if a full-length contig generated from sanger sequencing of an obtained clone completely matched the reference sequence. for 73% of the orf models, the 454-reads give confirmation at the 98-100% level. sanger sequencing of the clones could verify an additional  <dig> orf models . these models can therefore be considered verified, though it should be noted that even 100% coverage of an orf model does not exclude the possibility of the presence of exons that were not annotated. the high coverage rates do, however, guarantee that the annotated exons are expressed. furthermore, incomplete coverage by 454-reads does not necessarily imply inaccurate annotation; in some cases, less than 100% coverage could be the result of low expression level of the transcript and consequently low sequencing depth. we note that due to the amplification of the transcripts, the targeted transcriptome method that we have used is expected to normalize the abundance of the amplicons to a degree.

while end verification by sanger sequencing can confidently verify the 5’ and 3’ ends, this method provides no information on the internal exon structure of long orfs . we also find that the overall success rate of sequencing clones using the sanger method is significantly lower than the  <dig> sequencing of amplicons. cloning bottlenecks, failure to generate contigs due to end reads not covering the internal segments, and random sequencing failures could be among the contributing factors. direct sequencing of amplicons through  <dig> or other parallel sequencing methods clearly bypasses these limitations.

CONCLUSIONS
a central challenge in the post-genomic era is the mapping of the genotype-phenotype relationship. for biochemical networks, the functional connections between genotype and phenotype are deciphered through the use of the available high-throughput experimental and computational platforms. each technology can be used to generate a vast amount of data particular to some aspects of a given biochemical network. ultimately the gathered data could be used to manipulate the biochemical systems for biotechnological and medical purposes. however, such efforts rest upon the availability of accurate structural and functional annotations, as well as the availability of the biological resources, such as orf clones. in this study, we have carried out both computational functional annotation and direct experimental verification of structural annotations of jgi v <dig>  enzymatic orfs, which include both metabolic and non-metabolic enzymes. we carried out targeted amplification of the orfs by rt-pcr and sequenced the products  to verify the orf structures. the approach of using targeted amplification of orfs offers several advantages over other high-throughput approaches that are not targeted; importantly, it establishes the cis-connectivity between the 5’ and 3’ ends of the orf. such cis-connectivity cannot be established from whole transcriptome sequencing, tiling array analysis or other high-throughput transcriptome survey methodologies . in addition, the generated amplicons can be cloned, as we have done so here, to provide reagents for downstream large- or small-scale experiments, which can be used to define genotype to phenotype maps as well as accomplishing bio-engineering tasks. with an ever-increasing number of organisms whose genome sequences are becoming available , the need for structural and functional annotation and their verification is clear. the approach and experiments carried out in this study can be readily extended to other species to facilitate functional annotation and structural verification of their gene models.
