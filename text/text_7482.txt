BACKGROUND
multidrug resistant escherichia coli clones of the phylogenetic group d causing extraintestinal human infections are increasingly reported all over the world  <cit> . among them, e. coli clonal groups d-st <dig>  and d-st <dig>  are widely spread among different hosts, often causing urinary tract infections  and conferring resistance to antibiotics  <cit> . isolates belonging to the d-st <dig> have been involved in the spread of genes encoding extended spectrum β-lactamases  , cephamycinases , carbapenemases  or methylases   <cit> . recent studies have reported variants of st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> among esbl and non-esbl-producing strains from specific locations  <cit> . the presence of genes possibly involved in biofilm production detected in some of these surveys  suggests the ability of these clones to adhere and form biofilm, which could be favouring their persistence; however, such ability has not been specifically evaluated  <cit> . biofilm growing ability of bacteria is commonly assessed by a quantitative measure of their adherence to microtiter plates, although electron microscopy analyses provide more accurate information on the biofilm structure and presence of matrix  <cit> .

in this study, we aim to characterize the intraclonal diversity of extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli  isolates from phylogenetic group d  isolated from different geographic locations and sources, and to assess their ability to adhere and form biofilm on abiotic surfaces in order to evidence a possible contribution of biofilm formation to their persistence and epidemicity.

methods
bacterial isolates
we analysed thirty-five e. coli isolates belonging to st <dig> , st <dig> complex  and st <dig> complex  isolated from multiple sources and countries. they include either isolates associated with nosocomial or community outbreaks in different countries  <cit>  or isolates collected from non-clinical sources from distinct countries and showing variable antibiotic resistance profiles, selected from published papers by the end of  <dig>  they were recovered from nosocomial  and community-acquired infections , healthy volunteers , food products  or animals  and produced diverse esbl or ampc enzymes. their epidemiological features are shown in table  <dig>  isolates were taken as part of standard patient care and no ethical approval was required for their use.

virulence genes profile
screening of  <dig> virulence factors  including adhesins, toxins, siderophores, polysaccharide coatings and others  presumptively associated with expec isolates was performed by pcr as previously described  <cit> . the fisher’s exact test was used for each comparison, a p value < <dig>  being considered to reveal significant differences. a strain satisfied the criteria for being expec if it carried two or more of the following genes: papa, papc, sfa/focde, afa/drabc, iuta and kpsmii <cit> .

adhesion and biofilm-producing assays
the ability of d-e.coli strains to in vitro adhere was investigated by a modified quantitative biofilm production assay, as previously described  <cit> . the e. coli strain cft <dig> and the culture medium supplemented with 1%  glucose were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. assays were performed in quintuplicate and repeated at least  <dig> times. the cut-off optical density  was defined as three standard deviations above the mean od of the negative control , and strains were classified as non-adherent , weakly adherent , moderately adherent , or strongly adherent . the ultrastructural analysis of biofilm was performed by a field emission scanning electron microscope  . briefly, adjusted inocula  of each strain diluted with  <dig>  ml of fresh lb supplemented with 1%  glucose were added to 24-well plates with round glass coverslips  put into each well and incubated at 37°c for 24 h. the content of each well was removed and the round coverslips were washed with pbs  twice. biofilms grown on coverslips were fixed with  <dig> % glutaraldehyde in na-cacodylate  <dig>  m  buffer solution  for 2 h at room temperature. following three washing steps with the same buffer solution, samples were dehydrated through graded ethanol  and dried with hexamethyldisilazane  for 1 h30'. samples were air dried overnight and coated by sputtering with a gold target  <cit> .

RESULTS
diversity among clonal groups of e. coli phylogroup d
isolates belonging to the three analysed sts exhibited inter and intraclonal variability regarding the vf profile and the ability to form biofilm. on the basis of their virulence scores, all st <dig>  and all st <dig> , and only sporadic st <dig>  isolates were classified as expec . while most st <dig> and st <dig> carried pap alleles , iha, kpsmtii-k <dig> and ompt, st <dig> isolates frequently contained fyua, malx and trat, suggesting the presence of different genomic islands among e. coli phylogroup d isolates.

ap values  are shown in bold when p <  <dig> . b expec status defined by the presence of two or more among papa, papc, sfa/foc, afa/drabc, iuta and kpsmtii, as suggested  <cit> .

most of the isolates exhibited a weak adherence ability to abiotic surfaces  while a few strains were classified as moderately adherent  or strongly adherent  , and were considered as presumptive biofilm producers. among all the strains resulting to be moderately or strongly adherent, fesem observations revealed the presence of aggregates and eps matrix, both compatible with a biofilm development, only in two st <dig>  and three st <dig>  isolates . these isolates corresponded to diverse clonal variants exhibiting variable virulence gene profiles, preventing from establishing a link between this phenotype and a given virulence gene or virulence gene profile.

the presence of a characteristic virulence gene profile for isolates of different e. coli clonal groups confirms results obtained in previous studies  <cit> . however, small differences in the virulence profile observed among closely related isolates might be explained by the plasticity of the genomic islands where these genes are commonly clustered  <cit> . most of the isolates were associated with extraintestinal infections , including the non-expec st <dig> isolates. the lack of correspondence between expec status and the ability to cause extraintestinal disease further suggests that other non-explored virulence factors might influence their pathogenicity  <cit> . our results indicate that biofilm production seems not to be directly related with their epidemiological success, as already observed for the pandemic st <dig> e. coli clone  <cit> . moreover, when observed in particular strains, this feature could not be linked to a specific virulence gene or virulence profile.

intraclonal diversity of st <dig> isolates
thirteen isolates corresponding to  <dig> pfge types were classified in different serogroups , and clustered in two groups on the basis of the similarity of the xbai restriction profiles. cluster i comprised closely related isolates  causing hospital or community acquired infections that exhibited a common virulence gene profile . cluster ii  included two indistinguishable isolates recovered from different samples of ready-to-eat salads in portugal and from poultry meat in norway. they differ in the presence of iron, iss, bmae  and gafd , and the lack of iha, sat and papgii, observed for isolates of cluster i. all st <dig> isolates exhibited resistance to streptomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and they were frequently resistant to tetracycline , and to chloramphenicol . none of the isolates produced esbl, but one encoded cmy- <dig> 

isolates belonging to cluster i seem to have been circulating among different continents since at least  <dig>  as reflects this and other studies  <cit> . despite of the small sample analysed, differences among st <dig> isolates from human and non-human origins suggest independent evolution of particular e. coli variants in different hosts.

intraclonal diversity of st <dig> isolates
these isolates corresponded to serogroups o <dig>  or o <dig> , and they mainly were biotype c , which seem to be more commonly observed than those of biotype a   <cit> . most isolates analysed  were recovered from patients and healthy individuals in france, spain, korea and the usa and shared a pool of ten virulence genes  . the st <dig> isolate belonged to o <dig> serotype and shared eight out of the ten frequent vfs, suggesting a common origin. most isolates were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole , streptomycin , ciprofloxacin , tetracycline  and nalidixic acid . resistance against kanamycin , gentamicin , tobramycin , netilmicin  or chloramphenicol  was also observed. esbl or ampc production was sporadically detected .

the study highlights the spread of st <dig> isolates of biotype c with highly similar virulence gene profile in different continents over almost three decades, supporting previous observations in specific countries  <cit> . unfortunately, clonal relatedness among different strains could not be analysed due to the spontaneous lysis of dna, also reported by other groups  <cit> .

intraclonal diversity of st <dig> isolates
isolates of this clonal complex  were recovered from human infections , and exhibited a common virulence profile  . most isolates belonging to cluster i  identified in hospitalized patients from portugal, spain, norway and kuwait contained additionally iuta and sat  whereas cluster ii  showed consistently kpsmtiii but not iuta and sat. cluster iii comprised only one isolate from norway corresponding to a single locus variant of st <dig> . st <dig> isolates were commonly resistant to streptomycin, sulphonamides, trimethoprim , kanamycin, tetracycline, nalidixic acid , gentamicin , tobramycin , ciprofloxacin  and chloramphenicol  .

these results suggest that several st <dig> variants seem to be circulating in distinct countries. in contrast with st <dig> and st <dig>  isolates frequently produced either esbls  or ampc  enzymes, which might have facilitated the selection and successful spread of diverse st <dig> variants  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
factors responsible for the increased ability of particular e. coli clones to successfully spread and persist are poorly understood, and our work represents one of the few studies exploring the phenotypic traits involved in the increased epidemicity of emerging antibiotic resistant e. coli clonal groups  <cit> . the results highlight the inter and intraclonal diversity of e. coli clones of phylogroup d and further suggest the circulation of highly transmissible st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> variants, some of them being particularly widespread in different geographic areas and settings. the lack of association between the ability to produce biofilm exhibited by a few strains and specific virulence gene or virulence gene profiles points out the need to further explore factors involved in the selection of particular epidemic variants with enhanced ability to colonize and persist for extended periods of time.
