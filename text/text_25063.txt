BACKGROUND
arabidopsis: life in the fast lane
less than a decade ago “arabidopsis and its poorly known relatives” was the title chosen to introduce the closest relatives of arabidopsis thaliana to a broader readership  <cit> . this review summarized both the systematics and taxonomy of the genus and also the ecologically important traits to be studied in a. thaliana’s “wild” relatives. its necessity was obvious because until  <dig>  a huge number of species  were recognized in arabidopsis in the traditional sense. arabidopsis’ taxonomical history was compiled in detail more than 10 years ago  <cit> , and nine arabidopsis species with several subspecies were recognized by this time. based on this work and unraveling the evolutionary history of the genus arabis  <cit> , which differs morphologically from arabidopsis only in the position of the cotyledons relative to the radicle in the seeds, a new systematic concept was presented 10- <dig> years ago  <cit> . several species and subspecies have since been added either because molecular studies provided new resolution  <cit>  or because description of new species  <cit>  led to changes in their respective taxonomic rank   <cit> .

arabidopsis has been estimated to comprise of at least nine species and six subspecies  <cit> , or up to  <dig>  species and nine subspecies  <cit>  depending on the taxonomic approach and the identifier. the most recent studies, e.g. on a. arenosa and its segregates  <cit> , and taxonomic entities within the genus arabidopsis are summarized in table  <dig>  note that few of them will probably not be considered in future either because of insufficient diagnostic morphological characters or because they do not represent monophyletic lineages. russian arabidopsis taxa  <cit> , however, may be considered more carefully in future, based on current morphological and molecular analysis .table  <dig>

monophyly is generally accepted among arabidopsis taxa by plant scientists at present. however, considering that a. thaliana is a model system taxonomic recognition of new species as arabidopsis is acknowledged much faster than comparable systematic-taxonomic changes in other genera. one such contrary example from the brassicaceae family is the genus noccaea which includes important model species for heavy metal tolerance and hyperaccumulation. noccaea caerulescens required more than 30 years to be recognized appropriately within the correct evolutionary framework  <cit> . systematics and taxonomy in the genus arabidopsis is thus ever-debatable and in constant need of further improvement.

developing a comprehensive systematic framework
to date there is limited genetic information across the entire genus which allows for adequate taxonomic and systematic comparison. the first study highlighting centers of genetic variation in europe for the main evolutionary lineages also provided evidence for extensive shared plastidic variation among species  <cit> . the female component of nuclear-encoded self-incompatibility genes  also revealed trans-specific polymorphism among some of the same species  <cit> .

some major evolutionary lineages have been identified in the arabidopsis genus  <cit> , namely the following groups: a. halleri, a. lyrata and a. arenosa. three other genetically isolated diploid species have been identified, a. croatica, a. cebennensis and a. pedemontana. a few allopolyploids are also well studied: a. suecica with a. arenosa and a. thaliana as parental species  <cit> , and a. kamchatica with a. lyrata and a. halleri  as parents  <cit> . another taxonomically not yet introduced tetraploid taxon  is found in lower austria, which is either the result of hybridization and genome doubling between a. arenosa and a. lyrata , or genome duplication of diploid a. lyrata  with subsequent introgression from tetraploid a. arenosa  <cit> .

for some of these major lineages and their subspecies there are more detailed genetic studies available covering either a broader geographic scale or larger sets of taxa. for a. halleri it has been shown that all five subspecies are closely related to each other, and that one major center of genetic diversity is located in the eastern austrian alps  <cit> . it has also been concluded for a. halleri that metallicolous populations have been founded separately from distinct non-metallicolous populations without suffering from founder effects  <cit> . the same authors provided a comprehensive phylogeographic scenario  <cit> ; and although the accessions studied were not characterized taxonomically, many helpful comments linking taxonomy with genetic data were provided. for a. lyrata there are several studies available showing general phylogeographic patterns and hybrid speciation on a large scale  <cit> . local-scale phylogeographic studies in north america highlighted switches in mating system  <cit> . population-based analysis with a few selected populations provided the first evidence for population genetic structure at varying geographic scales  <cit> . at a more local scale and focusing on different aspects of adaptation there are numerous contributions covering a. lyrata  <cit> , and comprehensive reviews have recently been presented to summarize many more aspects  <cit> . there is very limited information regarding a. arenosa, one of the most diverse evolutionary lineages in arabidopsis  <cit> , with only one phylogeographic-systematic study at a broad geographic scale  <cit> . nevertheless, a. arenosa has proven to be an excellent model to study the formation and evolution of allopolyploids  <cit>  and plant adaptation  <cit> .

a recently published review  <cit>  emphasized the need for all-encompassing evolutionary studies within the genus arabidopsis that provide a broader framework on genus-wide genetic diversity and differentiation, in order to enable researchers to study molecular mechanisms of speciation-related processes in interspecific comparative approaches. our goal here was to provide a reliable phylogenetic-systematic base line using ribosomal dna sequence variation from the internal transcribed spacers  <dig> and  <dig> and the trnlf region of the plastid genome  <cit> . these data were combined with population genetic variation based on a set of nuclear-encoded microsatellite loci shown to be highly sensitive for resolving arabidopsis lineages  <cit> . finally, since genome size and chromosome numbers are important cytological characters that significantly influence various organismal traits, we conducted a comprehensive scan of cytological variation via the homoploid nuclear dna content within and among the principal gene pools in arabidopsis.

here we explore the gene pools of arabidopsis taxa using a battery of molecular markers and their cytology to identify clearly genetically distinct units over their entire geographic distribution, develop a schematic phylogeographic-systematic scenario based on this data and lastly, comment on any discrepancies between these resolved gene pools and existing taxonomic identifiers.

RESULTS
our results indicate the existence of several major gene pools or species groups; confirming several taxonomically recognized species and subspecies . however, it is also obvious that gene flow and/or shared ancestry blur some distinct evolutionary units in several cases, both between ploidy levels and among species.figure  <dig> 
sampling distribution. geographic distribution of the analyzed arabidopsis taxa. a) circumpolar perspective of sample distribution, b) european sampling of accessions. detailed accession data are provided with additional file  <dig> 



the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms  was not sufficient to resolve taxa below the species level, most likely because the genus’ radiation within the last  <dig>  million years is too recent.

its sequence data recognize major gene pools
the recognition of major gene pools or evolutionary lineages is best illustrated by the splitstree analysis based on the its . six major groups with deep splits were detected: 1) a. halleri and its subspecies, 2) a. lyrata and its segregates and subspecies, including all a. kamchatica accessions, 3) a. arenosa and its various segregates, subspecies and related taxa , 4) diploid a. croatica, which is closest to a. arenosa, 5) a. cebennensis, which is sister to 6) a. pedemontana. notably, the its failed to resolve taxa within evolutionary lineages. for example, a few a. arenosa accessions cluster within a. lyrata or a. croatica . this is best explained by interploidy and interspecies gene flow and/or shared ancestry, as commented on earlier  <cit> . all analyzed a. suecica accessions carried its types, which clustered with a. thaliana its types . the complete alignment can be viewed in additional file  <dig> figure  <dig>

nuclear dna content supports the distinction of major its gene pools
the major gene pools identified by its sequences were also significantly differentiated by their homoploid nuclear dna content . disregarding a. thaliana, with a basic chromosome number of n =  <dig>  and on average 47% less dna than the other diploid accessions, the homoploid nuclear dna content varied  <dig> –fold among diploid and  <dig> –fold among tetraploid accessions, respectively. the differences among major gene pools were highly significant among diploid  and marginally significant among tetraploid  accessions. at the diploid level, accessions of a. arenosa possessed the lowest nuclear dna content, followed by a. croatica , a. lyrata , a. halleri  and, finally, a. pedemontana  and a. cebennensis . interestingly, a. croatica and a. arenosa was the only species pair with non-significant differentiation in nuclear dna contents. among tetraploids, a. lyrata exhibited on average 5% lower nuclear dna content than a. arenosa, although it still fell within the range of a. arenosa variation.figure  <dig>

in contrast to among-group nuclear dna content, variation was markedly reduced within the major gene pools and differences among accessions were minimal . in tetraploids, the variation was  <dig> –fold and  <dig> –fold among a. lyrata and a. arenosa accessions, respectively.

absolute genome size estimates are also provided for all taxa in table  <dig> in a brassicaceae-wide screen. the 1c-value of a. thaliana ecotype columbia is about  <dig>  pg. the estimated physical size of its genome is currently about  <dig> mbp, . our estimated 1c-value of  <dig>  pg for north american a. lyrata indicates a respective genome size of approximately  <dig> mbp and is very close to the published physical size  of the a. lyrata genome  <cit> . the discrepancy of about 5% could be explained by missing sequence data from centromeric regions.

chloroplast sequence data recognize some major gene pools but indicates shared polymorphism
in contrast to the its, plastid trnlf sequences did not fully resolve all evolutionary lineages. the tcs network recognized  <dig> suprahaplotypes and two additional suprahaplotypes from a. thaliana/a. suecica . central suprahaplotypes in the network with the highest frequency of occurrence  were largely shared among lineages . in agreement with placement of the root , haplotype a was the most ancestral , and it was shared among all lineages. suprahaplotypes b and c were shared among the three major lineages , and suprahaplotypes d and e were shared by a. halleri and a. arenosa only. insufficient resolution in the chloroplast suggests the presence of shared ancestral gene pools and subsequent incomplete lineage sorting  <cit> ; and/or hybridization and introgression which in some cases resulted in stable allopolyploids . in particular, hybridization and introgression may not be resolved by its data because of rapid and ongoing concerted evolution  <cit> . past interploidy and interspecific gene flow has been demonstrated among european arabidopsis species  <cit> , and introgression zones can indeed have larger geographic extension and long-term persistence  <cit> . one notable detail taken from the tcs network is that connecting haplotypes were rarely missing. this might be anindicator for  limited bottlenecks and large past effective population sizes  <cit> . the trnlf alignment is shown in additional file  <dig>  and a summary of all suprahaplotypes and their distribution among taxa is shown in additional file  <dig> figure  <dig>

microsatellite analyses characterize distinctive taxa and cytotypes
a summary statistics table for microsatellite alleles within the various taxa is given with table  <dig>  and displays total number of alleles, mean number of alleles per locus, number of unique alleles, and number of rare alleles . these data show that tetraploids have a significantly higher number of alleles per locus per individual   than diploids, as one would expect. the highest numbers of total alleles were found within widely distributed diploid a. lyrata subsp. petraea, tetraploid a. arenosa subsp. arenosa and subsp. borbasii, but also with diploid a. carpatica and tetraploid a. petrogena subsp. exoleta, which highlights the importance of the a. arenosa gene pool as highly diverse  <cit> . accordingly, the same taxa did not only carry the highest numbers of unique alleles but also rare alleles . it is also demonstrated by the summary statistics that local endemics such as a. pedemontana, a. cebennensis, or a. croatica  had much lower numbers for any genetic scoring value . this was also true for north american a. lyrata subsp. lyrata and a. arenicola.table  <dig>

gene diversity statistics for microsatellite variation among tetraploid populations was not calculated, but respective data are analyzed and displayed with hierarchical structure analysis .



structure analysis combining diploids and tetraploids recognized five major groups: 1) a. lyrata, 2) a. arenosa , 3) a. halleri, 4) a. pedemontana and 5) a. cebennensis . two of these groups  consist of diploids and tetraploids, and structure was rerun to analyze these two groups separately . in this separate analysis, a. lyrata could be split into k =  <dig> populations i) north american a. lyrata subsp. lyrata and a. arenicola, ii) diploid a. umbrosa and tetraploid a. septentrionalis, and iii) european a. lyrata subsp. petraea .figure  <dig> 
genetic assignment analysis of microsatellite data in the genus
arabidopsis. genetic assignment analysis of microsatellite data running structure  <cit> . a) total diploid data set separated from the total dataset, b) total dataset comprising all diploids and tetraploids, c) tetraploid dataset. for all datasets and analyses ,  and  significantly recognized groups have been analyzed further individually  upper part,  lower part,  lower part. the a. lyrata group is highlighted in orange and yellow, a. arenosa in green, and a. halleri in blue, respectively. the optimal k-values for the various datasets are given with additional file  <dig>  the total dataset  upper part has been divided into an analysis with k =  <dig> and k =  <dig> 



a. arenosa, on the other hand, fell into k =  <dig> populations; all tetraploid a. arenosa including tetraploid a. neglecta and a. petrogena are set apart from the diploid taxa. vice versa the diploid a. carpatica and diploid a. petrogena formed distinct groups, respectively. the remaining diploids a. neglecta, a. croatica and a. nitida are combined to form one group. interestingly, structure was indifferent to the level of ploidy and the results are total in agreement with the its data. however, the initial round of analysis  produced minor incongruencies such as the occurrence of distinct a. pedemontana genetic variation in other species such as a. umbrosa. this similarity is immediately eliminated when increasing k to the next higher values .

when the structure analysis is strictly confined to each ploidy level separately, the results are more congruent with better resolution . in the diploid a. lyrata dataset , a. arenicola was again not separated from a. lyrata subsp. lyrata, but a. umbrosa and a. lyrata subsp. petraea were still distinguished from each other . note that we report multiple k’s here and their corresponding barplots in figure  <dig> to reflect the fact that delta k was frequently either very similar between two independent runs, or because the less optimal k was more biologically meaningful. both the optimal k, and the next-best optimal k in the structure analysis are thus reported.

the diploid a. arenosa group was structured with k = 3/ <dig>  and a. carpatica, a. petrogena subsp. petrogena, a. neglecta subsp. neglecta and a. croatica were significantly recognized. arabidopsis nitida  was less clearly recognized. the five subspecies of a. halleri  were grouped with some genetic clusters that distinguished a) a. halleri subsp. ovirensis, b) a. halleri subsp. tatrica/gemmifera, and c) a more complex and mixed cluster of a. halleri subsp. halleri . with subsp. dacica the results should be interpreted with caution since only three individuals were analyzed. in summary the structure within a. halleri subsp. halleri is not clear and possibly indicates the need for taxonomic re-evaluation after comprehensive phylogeographic analysis  <cit> .

analysis of the tetraploid dataset resulted in two unambiguously detectable genetic clusters only  and distinguished a. lyrata from a. arenosa. however, it is interesting to see that a. septentrionalis carried approximately 50% genetic admixture from the a. arenosa genetic cluster. when analyzing tetraploid a. lyrata separately , again a. septentrionalis was significantly different from tetraploid a. lyrata subsp. petraea from scotland and austria. in contrast, the tetraploid a. arenosa group was structured much less clearly . at best, two groups could be identified: a) mountainous a. arenosa subsp. borbasii and high-alpine a. arenosa var. intermedia, and b) remaining a. arenosa subsp. arenosa, a. petrogena subsp. exoleta and a. neglecta subsp. robusta. it should be noted that neither its data nor plastid dna data differentiated these groups further.

genetic diversity is similar in all major groups
gene diversity and nucleotide diversity is similar among the various groups of taxa . microsatellite gene diversity is highest in a. lyrata and a. arenosa and significantly lower in a. halleri. but this pattern is reverted when considering plastid dna, where a. arenosa shows significantly lower diversity values compared to the a. lyrata and a. halleri groups. its diversity values could be summarized in that a. lyrata comprises the most diverse group. thus, there is some coincidence with wide distribution ranges  and high overall genetic variation. however, considering that the a. arenosa group has a much smaller total distribution range compared to the others, it is remarkable that levels of genetic diversity are also high. for the two local endemics, a. cebennensis and a. pedemontana, genetic diversity values are consistently lower.

mating system affects genetic diversity in the various species and populations. however, detailed information on sporophytic self-incompatibility and mating system is available for a. lyrata and a. halleri only  <cit> . both are self-incompatible with few exceptions . also for the a. arenosa lineage there are only reports of a fully self-incompatibility system  <cit>  and there is only one questionable report of a selfing population, so far  <cit> . two of the proven allopolyploids  are self-compatible  <cit> . for many of the remaining taxa and cytotypes no data were available, and we added our results from many inbreeding experiments at heidelberg botanical garden  to table  <dig>  most of these taxa are also self-incompatible, and only for a. arenicola was self-compatibility shown, which is well-reflected in lowest number of alleles per locus  and gene and nucleotide diversity of any marker system used herein . gene diversity  and nucleotide diversity  are for both a. arenicola and a. lyrata subsp. lyrata significantly lower than the respective mean values of the whole lyrata group . the self-incompatible mating system demonstrated for a. cebennensis in our cultivation experiments might not fit with its low values of number of alleles per locus  or gene diversity . however, these low numbers might be also explained simply by its narrow endemic distribution and small population sizes.

polyploidy characterizes species groups differently
mapping of polyploidy levels across the different taxa in our sample reveals that some lineages consist of diploids only . the origins of tetraploid lineages are less clear e.g. tetraploid a. lyrata occurs at low frequency in great britain and austria and there is evidence of introgression from tetraploid close relatives such as a. arenosa  <cit> . distinguishing between a simple doubling of diploid a. lyrata genomes within a single ancestral population , or the establishment of polyploid lineages as a result of hybridization and genome doubling between two divergent species  requires further investigation in this system.

for others such as tetraploid a. septentrionalis, no evidence has been presented for a hybrid origin. the most diverse group of taxa with respect to ploidy variation is the tetraploid and diploid lineages within a. arenosa. of the ten listed taxonomic units within a. arenosa, five are tetraploids . as a source of raw material for natural selection to shape novel genes, this genome duplication may well have contributed to genomic instability, leading to genome rearrangement and a driver of speciation in this group.

only for the very rare a. umezawana  is no chromosome data available, and unfortunately no leaf material was available for microsatellite analysis. since sequence data  do not favor any hybrid origin and the various a. halleri segregates are exclusively diploid, a. umezawana probably also represents a diploid taxon. for a. croatica there are diploid and tetraploid chromosome number reports, but the few reports of tetraploids in the field  <cit>  suggest misidentifications as for a. arenosa .

discussion
we have provided some historical evolutionary context for many of the non-model lineages that comprise the arabidopsis genus. its data provided the most robust signature to separate the main evolutionary lineages : 1) arabidopsis thaliana, 2) a. cebennensis, 3) a. pedemontana, 4) a. lyrata and its segregates/subspecies, 5) a. arenosa with numerous different species and cytotypes and a. croatica more distinct from the remainder, and 6) a. halleri and its subspecies. this summary excludes two hybrid species, namely arabidopsis suecica and a. kamchatica “bridging” a. thaliana/a. arenosa and a. halleri/a. lyrata, respectively. these taxa will be discussed subsequently, since there is increasing evidence of substantial gene flow over various species and/or ploidy levels  <cit> .

taxonomy and systematics of arabidopsis halleri and its relatives
delimitation of arabidopsis halleri is still debated among taxonomists. up to five subspecies have been recognized  <cit>  though two of these, a. halleri subsp. gemmifera  o’kane & al-shehbaz and a. halleri subsp. ovirensis  o’kane & al-shehbaz, are accepted by some authors as separate species, a. gemmifera  kadota and a. ovirensis  a. p. iljinsk., respectively  <cit> .

to date, three predominantly central european subspecies were recognized  <cit> : subsp. halleri, subsp. tatrica  kolník, and subsp. dacica  kolník. the third, asian a. halleri subsp. gemmifera is geographically separated from the other two subspecies  <cit> . we did not detect these three subspecies here. a. halleri subsp. gemmifera formed a cluster with a. halleri subsp. tatrica. arabidopsis halleri subsp. ovirensis was originally described as endemic to the eastern austrian high mountain range at mount hochobir . reports from other localities are most likely based on misidentifications . unique sequence types  in the populations from mount hochobir are in agreement with this narrow endemic distribution  <cit> . based on microsatellite data, a. halleri subsp. halleri is characterized by different distinct genetic clusters, which is in congruence with the multiple a. halleri gene pools shown earlier  <cit> : here there were two gene pools with admixture between them, and arabidopsis halleri subsp. dacica did not form a separate genetic cluster. limited taxon sampling prohibits further interpretation. although subsp. tatrica did not show genetic distinctiveness in this study, there is “genetic evidence” for the subspecies a. halleri subsp. tatrica  <cit> . based on the data presented here, we suggest recognizing five subspecies within a. halleri: gemmifera, tatrica, halleri, ovirensis, and dacica, of which a. halleri subsp. ovirensis is a genetically distinct local endemic taxon and of which a. halleri subsp. tatrica and subsp. dacica need further and detailed phylogeographic analysis. we had limited access to material from a. umezawana, but based on trnlf and its data it is closest to the various subspecies of a. halleri.

the evolutionary history of arabidopsis halleri can be summarized as follows: it has previously been shown that all five subspecies are closely related to each other, and that one major center of genetic diversity is located in the eastern austrian alps  <cit> . the latter  <cit>  explained this center of genetic diversity by secondary contact and admixture of different european gene pools. similar to the heavy-metal hyper accumulator n. caerulescens  <cit> , it was concluded that a. halleri metallicolous populations were founded independently from non-metallicolous populations without suffering from founder effects  <cit> . we think that radiation within a. halleri is likely to have occurred during pleistocene glaciation and deglaciation cycles  <cit> , which also fits with estimates  <cit>  suggesting it to be  <dig>   years ago for subsp. halleri. note that this study lacks other subspecies, so a deeper evolutionary split is possible. furthermore, microsatellite data suggest that a. halleri subsp. gemmifera may have originated from a. halleri subsp. tatrica from the tatra mountains.

systematics of arabidopsis arenosa spp. in relation to resolved gene pools
a. arenosa represents a diploid-tetraploid species complex composed of mainly biennial and predominantly outcrossing individuals  <cit> . the species complex has a distribution range covering most of eastern europe and is found in colline to high-alpine habitats exhibiting wide ecological amplitude, spanning from coastal sand dunes to high-alpine screes. depending on the author, the a. arenosa complex comprises several taxa at various taxonomic levels the complex has been treated as one species, a. arenosa, with two subspecies of partly overlapping distribution ranges in central europe  <cit> : the tetraploid subsp. arenosa, also occurring in northern europe, growing mainly on siliceous bedrock and sandy soil, and the tetraploid subsp. borbasii, growing predominantly on calcareous bedrock in mountainous regions. diploid a. neglecta was described mainly from the carpathians and rarely from the alps, where its occurrence is doubtful, since in the alps this taxon was referred to as cardaminopsis arenosa var. intermedia  <cit> . however, we clearly show that this taxon is closer to tetraploid a. arenosa subsp. borbasii. based on morphological and karyological data, several additional  diploid carpathian taxa were proposed at the species and subspecies level, and attributed to the genus cardaminopsis  <cit> . some of these names were never published, however, and kept as “nomina provisoria”   <cit> . taxonomic concepts in the a. arenosa species complex are still strongly debated  <cit> , and we have endeavored to provide clarification here. the lack of resolution for the slower mutating its and trnlf regions suggests that  radiation within the pleistocene is plausible for this species complex . our structure results distinguish mountainous-alpine tetraploid a. arenosa subsp. borbasii and a. arenosa subsp. arenosa var. intermedia from the remaining tetraploid taxa. diploid taxa are resolved into a. neglecta subsp. neglecta, a. carpatica, a. petrogena subsp. petrogena, and arabidopsis nitida. diploid a. croatica is also well separated and shows clear affinities with the a. arenosa species group as a whole .

the a. arenosa species complex exhibits the highest levels of genetic diversity within the genus. only a. lyrata subsp. petraea has comparative values here. in tetraploid a. arenosa subsp. arenosa/subsp. borbasii these levels might be explained by  local, periglacial survival,  lack of genetic bottlenecks and maintenance of large effective population sizes during postglacial migration into formerly glaciated regions, and  gene flow between different taxa and/or ploidy levels  <cit> . in the cases of a. carpatica and a. petrogena subsp. exoleta, the high levels might be an indicator for past and ongoing speciation within the a. arenosa complex in the western carpathians  <cit> .

taxonomy and systematics of a. lyrata and its close relatives
worldwide, the phylogeography of a. lyrata largely reflects its recent introduction by humans. three biogeographically defined groups have been recognized: eurasia, the amphi-pacific region, and north america  <cit> . however, the most widely used taxonomy recognizes only two corresponding subspecies , with a third subspecies representing the allopolyploid a. kamchatica  <cit> . additional eurasian taxa such as a. septentrionalis and a. umbrosa have been treated synonymously under a. lyrata subsp. petraea   <cit> . our data clearly shows that the north american taxa a. lyrata subsp. lyrata and a. arenicola are close relatives, and that the self-compatible a. arenicola probably originated postglacially from a. lyrata populations  <cit> .

in accordance with the panarctic flora taxonomic concept microsatellites recognized two arctic taxa: a. petraea subsp. umbrosa and a. petraea subsp. septentrionalis . both taxa provide a bridge by connecting the european a. lyrata subsp. petraea with the two north american taxa geographically . remarkably, a. petraea subsp. septentrionalis represents a tetraploid taxon and given the high genetic similarity of subsp. umbrosa with subsp. septentrionalis, the latter is most probably an autotetraploid.

local endemics and hybrid taxa
a. cebennensis, a. pedemontana and a. croatica have distinct highly endemic european distribution ranges . the species also differ markedly in their ecological preferences and morphology, all of which correlates with the deeper phylogenetic splits inferred among these taxa  and the biogeographic affinity of a. pedemontana and a. cebennensis to a. halleri and of a. croatica to a. arenosa and a. lyrata. arabidopsis pedemontana and a. cebennensis share some traits with a. halleri, such as extensive clonal growth, preference for higher moisture, longevity and occurrence at high. additionally, there is also a striking correlation with phenology, with increasing plant height from a. halleri, a. pedemontana towards a. cebennensis , and increased preference of continuously available and cool streaming water in the same sequence of species .figure  <dig>

these parallel traits support an evolutionary vicariance scenario in potential refugia west of the main distribution area of a. halleri, which itself is distributed along the whole alpine mountain chain. the western and relict occurrence of a. pedemontana and a. cebennensis may reflect adaptation to refugia during warming phases, i.e. high-and sub-alpine spring habitats with cool streaming water. our data did not provide enough power for divergence time estimates, but it seems likely that speciation in a. pedemontana and a. cebennensis occurred during early pleistocene glaciation and deglaciation cycles.

a. croatica, on the other hand, is morphologically and ecologically much closer to diploid taxa of a. lyrata and a. arenosa. as such, it could be regarded as a derivative of the ancestral gene pool of these respective diploid species    <cit> .

we did not consider in detail here hybrid taxa such as a. kamchatica and a. suecica. but it is notable that there is increasing evidence of substantial interspecies and interploidal gene flow  <cit> . it is accepted that a. kamchatica has a multiple polytopic origin  <cit> , and there is increasing evidence that a. suecica does not result from a single hybridization event  <cit>  but rather, multiple events with genetically distinct parents , demonstrated and summarized earlier  <cit> . the first sightings of diploid a. arenosa from the baltic sea area is now documented , and future genomic analyses will highlight the relationships with putative parental populations of a. arenosa and a. thaliana. as noted here, a. petraea subsp. septentrionalis is very likely of hybrid origin, consistent with botanical notes - with limited sampling and one russian population only - which concluded “…  may have originated from a different refugium probably located more in the east”  <cit> . genomic analyses of these endemic and hybrid systems will provide further insight into their evolutionary dynamics.

genome size variation in arabidopsis
we did not focus in detail on a. thaliana, but as we saw in this study published estimates of nuclear dna content size in a. thaliana also show some genomic variation among wild accessions   <cit> . absolute values in pg are discussed critically in the same work, and differ largely from other estimates  <cit> . published results from larger-scale studies were obtained by comparing a. halleri and a. lyrata while focusing on allopolyploid a. kamchatica  <cit> , plants from the latter had a slightly smaller genome size than the sum of its diploid parents. the same study could differentiate genome sizes at the subspecies level, by comparing a. kamchatica subsp. kamchatica and subsp. kawasakiana . data from a. kamchatica  <cit>  showed only small differences compared to data from much smaller sample sizes  <cit>  and focusing on a. lyrata. another large-scale study  <cit>  focused on european a. lyrata and a. arenosa and demonstrated slightly but significantly larger nuclear dna content in a. lyrata compared to a. arenosa and its segregates . however, in general there is only a limited number of genome size studies within the genus arabidopsis. published genome size with the smallest genome size found in a. arenosa  and the largest genome size observed in a. cebennensis  confirm our results  <cit> .

some discrepancies are apparent among published studies when comparing absolute values of genome sizes either given in pg or in mbp but this is mostly due to deviations in methodology   <cit> .

taxonomic remarks
we do not formally propose new taxonomical combinations but rather highlight some changes  which need to be implemented pending completion of more detailed morphological and phylogeographic analyses.

arabidopsis arenosa subsp. arenosa var. intermedia
this taxon is best kept as subsp. of a. arenosa, namely a. arenosa subsp. intermedia. this reflects at best that all tetraploid segregates of the a. arenosa group closely belong to each other, but also considers the morphological distinctiveness and local alpine occurrence of a. arenosa subsp. intermedia.

arabidopsis umezawana
we have no evidence of a hybrid origin , but instead convincing evidence that it falls into the a. halleri group. consequently the taxon is at best treated as a subspecies, namely a. halleri subsp. umezawana.

arabidopsis arenicola
this taxon is closest related to north american a. lyrata subsp. lyrata. consequently, it should be treated as subspecies under a north american a. lyrata, namely a. lyrata subsp. arenicola. morphological differences are weak: compared to a. lyrata subsp. lyrata fruits are terete or only slightly flattened, and cotyledons are incumbent  <cit> .

a. lyrata subsp. petraea
arabidopsis petraea subsp. septentrionalis and a. petraea subsp. umbrosa have already been described and characterized within the pan arctic flora project as subspecies within a. petraea. there are two different options to solve this taxonomic/phylogenetic incongruence. 1) european a. lyrata subsp. petraea is treated as a. petraea subsp. petraea, thereby taking geographical and genetic affinities into account and not changing taxonomy of subsp. septentrionalis and umbrosa. 2) treating members of the a. lyrata group on subspecies level and establishing the new combinations a. lyrata subsp. septentrionalis and a. lyrata subsp. umbrosa. we prefer the second option, since this would minimize future confusion and misuse of species names  <cit> . clearly more and detailed studies of these two taxa are needed. from the herein presented microsatellite analysis it could be hypothesized that the a. halleri genome is also introgressed into both species. the structure analysis shows some affinities with the purple genetic cluster and linking in particular subsp. septentrionalis and umbrosa with some populations of a. halleri and a. pedemontana , but see comments given above with a. pedemontana.

CONCLUSIONS
we characterized in detail the three main arabidopsis evolutionary lineages: a. halleri, a. lyrata and a. arenosa, including their respective subspecies in an attempt to present a genus-wide overview on genetic variation and taxon delimitation. the relationship among these three lineages is not completely certain due to the power of resolution across the assays used here, but there is some tendency that the lyrata lineage is more closely related to arenosa than to halleri, consistent with being sister taxa. three additional well-defined endemic species, a. pedemontana, a. cebennensis and a. croatica do form separate evolutionary lineages, with the latter  most likely positioned at the base of the a. arenosa lineage. the other two endemics are distantly related to any other lineage, but ecologically and morphologically closer to a. halleri. aside from these evolutionary lineages, there is a need to characterize some taxa in much more detail, such as the arctic taxa of a. lyrata and members of the a. arenosa species aggregate. one other conclusion which stems from the extensive chloroplast haplotype sharing observed among all major evolutionary lineages is the need to qualify and quantify the extent of gene flow within the entire genus.
