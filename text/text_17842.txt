BACKGROUND
sweetpotato  is the seventh most important food crop in the world  <cit> . it has a worldwide production of approximately  <dig> million metric tons and is the third most important root/tuber crop after potato  and cassava . world production is centered in southeast asia, with china being the largest producer, while sub-saharan africa ranks second  <cit> . sweetpotato is used as a source of starch, ethanol, and animal fodder in most of asia while it is considered a subsistence crop in africa. the usa, japan, australia, new zealand, south africa and israel are among the few producing countries that grow sweetpotato as a vegetable to market in developed economies. global demand for sweetpotato is on the rise due to its high nutritional value. the nutrition action health letter from the center for science in the public interest, usa  <cit> , rates sweetpotatoes as the highest ranking vegetable for human nutrition.

the most economically important physiological process in sweetpotato production is storage root  development. sweetpotatoes are commercially propagated through vegetative cuttings. these cuttings produce adventitious roots that give rise to the srs  <cit> . adventitious roots originate from primordia located on the nodes, as well as from the cut ends, i.e., “wound” roots  <cit> . initially, white fibrous roots  develop and some of these subsequently develop into srs. depending on the number of frs induced to form srs, sweetpotato plants will yield either a high  or low number of srs that may even be reduced to one very large sr per plant  <cit> . togari  <cit>  described the sequence of anatomical events leading to sr initiation in varieties okinawan and beinakzi and reported that the regular vascular cambium layer first appears 20 days after transplanting , followed by the initial development of secondary anomalous cambium  features at  <dig> dat. togari  <cit>  also documented the incidence of stele lignification and proposed that lignification prevents sr initiation. wilson and lowe  <cit>  also suggested that only the appearance of ac can prevent stele lignification.

recently, we demonstrated in both georgia jet and beauregard sweetpotato varieties , that the period spanning  <dig> to  <dig> dat is critical in determining whether adventitious roots become lignified or initiate as srs, and that the appearance of ac marks the initial phase of sr formation  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of adventitious roots to become srs are, however, poorly understood. expression studies have been used in an effort to elucidate factors involved in sr formation. you et al.  <cit>  constructed a cdna library of early-stage srs, and identified  <dig> genes differentially expressed between frs  and srs. among them were a no apical meristem -like and a mads-box  protein gene, both of which were down-regulated in srs. mcgregor  <cit>  found several nac family transcriptional regulator proteins that were down regulated in storage roots, similar to the nam-like protein described by you et al.  <cit> . mcgregor  <cit>  also identified up-regulated expression of two nam-like genes, as well as sporamin genes and genes involved in starch biosynthesis, in storage roots that developed six weeks after planting compared to fibrous roots. several additional mads-box genes  expressed in root tissues have been isolated from sweetpotato, and their possible roles in root development have been deduced  <cit> . tanaka et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> genes with differential expression among frs, thick roots, and srs. one of the genes, srf <dig>  encoded a receptor-like kinase with high expression around the primary cambium and xylem meristem. in addition, tanaka et al.  <cit>  suggested three sweetpotato class  <dig> knotted1-like homeobox  genes as possible regulators of cytokinin levels in srs.

de-novo assembly of transcript sequences produced by next-generation sequencing  technologies offers a rapid approach to obtaining expressed gene sequences for non-model organisms. indeed, most recently, ngs was used by several research groups to obtain leaf, stem and root transcriptome data for different sweetpotato cultivars  <cit> . tao et al.  <cit>  used illumina ngs, employing a combination of different tissues at different developmental stages, to generate  <dig>  annotated transcripts, and identified differentially expressed transcripts in different tissues, including roots. xie et al.  <cit>  analyzed the transcriptome of a purple sweetpotato, obtaining a total of  <dig>  unigenes, and suggested udp-glucose-flavonoid 3-o-glucosyltransferase as one of the key enzymes in anthocyanin biosynthesis and that anthocyanin-3-glucoside might be one of the major components for anthocyanin pigments in the purple sweetpotato.

the presently described study focused on the identification of the molecular mechanisms involved in the initiation of sr formation in the leading sweetpotato variety in israel, georgia jet, by performing a detailed transcriptomic analysis of initiating srs  using ngs platforms. a two-step approach was undertaken:  generating a database for the sweetpotato root transcriptome using 454-roche sequencing of a cdna library created from pooled samples of two root types: frs and isrs;  comparing the expression profiles of isrs and frs, using the illumina genome analyzer to sequence non-normalized cdna libraries of the two root types and mapping the data onto the root transcriptome database. use of the 454-roche platform generated a total of  <dig>  reads,  <dig> % of which were clustered into  <dig>  contigs that matched  <dig>  known genes. the differential expression profiles between the two root types obtained by the illumina platform indicated down-regulation of classical root functions, such as transport and response to the environment, and of lignin biosynthesis in isrs, along with up-regulation of carbohydrate metabolism and starch biosynthesis. in addition, the data suggest delicate control of stem cell maintenance and differentiation in sweetpotato vascular development associated with the initiation of sr formation.

RESULTS
insight into the transcriptome of sweetpotato roots
defining the transcriptome using  <dig> sequencing and de-novo assembly
to obtain insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the initiation of sr formation in sweetpotato, and to identify candidate genes involved in this process, a two-stage approach was adopted. first, a database of the sweetpotato  root transcriptome was generated, using 454-roche sequencing of a cdna library created from pooled rna samples of two root types: isrs and non-initiating frs. roots were divided into either isrs or frs following microscopic analysis, as shown in figure  <dig>  second, the expression profiles of isrs and frs were compared, using the illumina genome analyzer, to sequence non-normalized cdna libraries of the two root types and the data were mapped onto the root transcriptome database.

a total of  <dig>  high-quality reads were generated with an average read length of 310 bp. the total number of bases  was  <dig> e +  <dig>  the mira assembly clustered  <dig> %  of the  <dig> sequence reads into  <dig>  contigs. the sequence length distribution is illustrated in figure  <dig>  the average length of the contigs was 519 ±  <dig> bases. the remaining  <dig>   sequences were retained as singletons. the clustered contig data are available via a web page connected to the volcani center, agricultural research organization web page at http://batata.agri.gov.il/.

functional annotation by sequence comparison with public databases
the transcriptomic data were used to query public genomic databases  using blastx. of the  <dig>  contigs,  <dig>   matched known genes at a cut-off e value ≤  <dig> e- <dig>  annotations of the two best hits for each contig are given at http://batata.agri.gov.il/ and in additional file  <dig>  e-value distribution for the top blast result for each sequence is given in figure  <dig>  the e-value distribution of the top hits in the nr database revealed that  <dig> % of the mapped sequences show significant homology , and 22% of the sequences showed greater than 80% similarity. these results indicated a high level of homology between our sequences and those found in the blast database. similarity distribution of the contigs to their blast results is illustrated in figure  <dig>  species distribution of the blast results is given in additional file  <dig>  demonstrating that most sweetpotato sequences exhibited similarity to vitis vinifera, ricinus communis and populus trichocarpa sequences , as well as to members of the solanaceae family. similarity to sequences of arabidopsis thaliana was less than 10%. the relatively low number of hits detected with ipomoea batatas  may be attributed to the low number of publicly available sequences in the database. the sweetpotato root transcript sequences generated in this study thus add to the recently accumulated sweetpotato sequences  <cit>  which can be used for the discovery of new genes involved in root development and functioning and in the initiation of sr formation.

functional classification by gene ontology  and by the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes 
to assess whether the sweetpotato root transcriptomic data were indeed representative of roots and srs, the annotated contigs were assigned to molecular functions using go. blastogo  <cit>  was used to obtain blast results for our contigs against the ncbi nr database and then again to obtain go annotations for the blast results. ontologizer  <cit>  was used to perform the go functional classification for the contigs. of the  <dig>  contigs that matched known genes,  <dig>  sequences could be grouped into  <dig>  different go categories, and all parental go terms  were assigned . of the go annotations,  <dig> % were associated with bp,  <dig> % were associated with mf, and  <dig> % were associated with cc . the contigs were further classified using goslim  <cit>  and results are presented in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  there was a high representation of cellular process, metabolic process, primary metabolic process, biosynthetic process, macromolecular metabolic process, response to stimulus, localization and transport in the parental category bp, high representation of binding , catalytic, transporter and transcription regulator activities in the mf parental category, and high representation of cell, intracellular, cytoplasm, organelle and membrane-bound organelle in the cc category. similar results have been recently demonstrated for sweetpotato  <cit>  and other root transcriptomes, including rice  <cit> , wild rice  <cit>  and avena barbata <cit> , supporting the quality of our georgia jet sweetpotato root transcriptome data.

to assign the detected contigs to biological pathways, the  <dig>  contig sequences were compared using blastx with an e-value cutoff of <10e- <dig> against the kegg biological pathways database. the contigs were mapped to  <dig> kegg pathways, as demonstrated in additional file  <dig>  figure  <dig> summarizes the top  <dig> represented biological pathways including at least  <dig> contigs. the highly represented pathways contained starch and sucrose metabolism, purine metabolism, methane metabolism, t-cell receptor signaling pathway, glycolysis, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, phenylalanine metabolism and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis.

taken together, the generated database of sweetpotato root transcripts  contains genes involved in:  classical root functions, such as binding and transport  as well as responses to the environment , in addition to metabolic processes with high representation of oxidation-reduction processes;  metabolic processes and regulation of metabolic processes as well as functions related to development. these results demonstrate the value of the generated transcriptomic data to serve as a database and a reference for continued study aimed at detecting early transcriptome changes in sweetpotato adventitious roots upon initiation of sr formation, as detailed below.

early transcriptome changes in sweetpotato adventitious roots upon initiation of sr formation
high-throughput sequencing at the cdna level, using illumina ga-iix technology, was carried out to compare the transcription profiles of two bar-coded samples:  a pooled sample of frs and  a pooled sample, of the same age, of isrs;  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads  were obtained for the frs and isrs samples, respectively. the reads were mapped against the set of  <dig>  flx contigs described above, as detailed in ‘methods’. to enable a direct comparison between the two samples, the read count per est contig was normalized as described in ‘methods’. the results of total normalized read counts in the fr and isr samples are presented in additional file  <dig> and are available via our sweetpotato database http://batata.agri.gov.il/. the reads were found to map to  <dig>  contigs out of the  <dig>  contigs that served as the database, i.e.  <dig> % .

a contig was considered differentially expressed between the isr and fr samples if two conditions were met:  at least  <dig> reads were mapped to this contig in at least one of the samples and  no reads were mapped to the contig in the other sample, or the fold change between read number in each sample was at least  <dig> . thus, a total of  <dig>  contigs were found to exhibit differential expression between the two samples. of these,  <dig>   contigs were up-regulated in isrs compared to frs and  <dig>   contigs were up-regulated in frs compared to isrs ;  <dig> contigs were found to exhibit at least 10-fold higher read number in isrs compared to frs and  <dig>  contigs were found to exhibit at least 10-fold higher read number in frs compared to isr .

genes involved in sporamin accumulation and carbohydrate metabolism are highly up-regulated during initiation of sr formation
the list of  <dig> contigs exhibiting highest differential expression  in isrs compared to frs is summarized in table  <dig>  in this list, expression values in the isr sample, expressed as normalized read number, range between  <dig> and  <dig>  reads per contig and the fold-change in expression compared to the fr sample ranges between 46- and  <dig> -fold . it should be noted that, for contigs that had no reads in the fr sample, read number was changed from zero to one to enable ‘fold-change’ calculation . highest fold-change expression levels were obtained for contigs representing various members of the sporamin and β-amylase genes, exhibiting 174- to  <dig> -fold change in expression. the products of these two genes are known to accumulate to high levels in sweetpotato srs, with sporamin and β-amylase accounting for about 60% and 5% of total soluble proteins in sweetpotato srs, respectively  <cit> . up-regulation of a contig representing an expansin gene in the isr sample was apparent  exhibiting  <dig> fold-change in expression. expansins are known as cell wall-loosening proteins affecting cell expansion in plants and were shown to be involved in root development . in the present work,  <dig> contigs representing expansin gene sequences were detected by illumina cdna sequencing . of these,  <dig> exhibited higher expression in isrs compared with frs, including  <dig> contigs  that showed high read number . our data thus suggest the involvement of expansin in initiation of sr formation and contradict previous findings by noh et al.  <cit>  showing that down-regulation of the ibexp <dig> expansin gene  in ipomoea batatas cv. yulmi enhanced sr development of sweetpotato.

expression values are expressed as normalized read number. ‘fold change’ is calculated as isr reads/fr reads. one annotation is given for each contig. annotations of the two best hits for each contig  are available in additional file  <dig>  isr, initiating storage root, fr fibrous root. * - read counts were changed from zero to one to enable ‘fold change’ calculation .

in addition, included in this list are genes involved in starch biosynthesis, coding for α and β subunits of adp glucose pyrophosphorylase  and phosphoglucomutase. this list includes a significant number of contigs without annotation . looking into the expression levels  of additional starch biosynthesis genes not included in table  <dig>  high expression of contigs representing several members of granule-bound starch synthase was detected . the high expression level  of a contig exhibiting homology to ferredoxin suggests its involvement in the redox modulation and activation of agpase  <cit> .

to follow changes in starch levels in the roots of georgia jet during the first 4 weeks after transplanting, spanning the timing of sr initiation  <cit> , we evaluated starch concentrations in the root system at several time points after transplanting . samples were taken from the entire root system, since up to 3 weeks after transplanting sr initiation could not be distinguished by microscopic analysis of root cross sections. the data indicated a peak of starch accumulation  at the initiation of sr formation, between  <dig> and 4 weeks after transplanting . starch levels of non-initiated, 2-month-old frs were found to be relatively low , suggesting that the increased starch in the pooled root sample was contributed by the isrs. these data are in agreement with the elevated expression of genes involved in starch biosynthesis detected by our illumina sequencing . to the best of our knowledge, the accumulated results represent novel data with respect to early elevation in expression of starch biosynthesis genes as well as starch accumulation, marking the initial phase of sr development.

regulators of meristematic tissue identity and maintenance, as well as of cell division, are up-regulated in isrs
a contig representing a class i knotted1-like protein  homologous to ipomoea nil pkn <dig>  mrna  and ibkn <dig> of ipomoea batatas  showed 60-fold higher expression in isrs compared to frs . knotted1-like homeobox  transcription factors are regulators involved in the establishment and maintenance of plant meristems, such as the shoot apical meristem . the cambium is a stem-like tissue  <cit> ; the term cambium refers to one or several layers of initials, analogous to the stem cells proposed for other meristems . divisions of these initials then produce phloem or xylem mother cells, which in turn can undergo several rounds of cell division before differentiating  <cit> . schrader et al.  <cit>  identified molecular markers that characterize the cambial zone in poplar, including genes that regulate meristem identity and mark the cambium initials, and genes that control cell division and mark xylem mother cells. of these genes, knox genes such as the poplar pttknox <dig>  pttknox <dig> and pttknox <dig> showed high expression in cambial samples  <cit> .

as indicated previously by wilson and lowe  <cit> , and as demonstrated by us  <cit>  for both the leading israeli sweetpotato variety georgia jet and an important usa variety, beauregard, initiation of sr formation is marked by the development of ac cells adjacent to xylem elements, starting  <dig> to 4 weeks after transplanting. repeated division of these cambium cells leads to the formation of rows of thin-walled parenchyma cells that will form the storage tissue of the sr  <cit> . several contigs homologous to knox genes were detected by us in the sweetpotato root transcriptome, with specific members exhibiting higher expression in isrs compared to frs . it is interesting to note that all identified members of the class i knotted1-like proteins exhibited at least twofold higher expression in isrs compared to frs, while genes belonging to the class ii knotted1-like family exhibited a versatile expression pattern . knoxi genes have been previously shown to be involved in the development of sweetpotato srs  <cit> , regulating cytokinin levels in that organ. tanaka et al.  <cit>  identified three different knoxi gene fragments—ibkn <dig>  ibkn <dig> and ibkn3—in sweetpotato sr. phylogenetic analysis of putative amino acid sequences showed that ibkn <dig> is homologous to the shoot meristemless  gene of arabidopsis thaliana, while ibkn <dig> and ibkn <dig> are homologous to the bp gene. expressions of ibkn <dig>  ibkn <dig> and ibkn <dig> were faint or undetectable in fibrous, non-storage roots  <cit> . mele eta al.  <cit>  suggested in arabidopsis that the bp gene regulates the lignin pathway, thus repressing premature cell differentiation. the class i knotted1-like genes found by us to be up-regulated in isrs included ibkn <dig> and ibkn <dig> homologues as well as additional family members .

expression is given as the normalized number of reads derived from the illumina sequencing data as detailed in ‘methods’. isr, initiating storage root, fr, fibrous root.

almost all of the cell-division-regulating genes that were detected in this work showed higher expression in isrs compared to frs, including genes encoding cyclin a-like and cyclin d-like proteins and five cyclin-dependent kinases . these results are in agreement with the observed increase in the number of ac cells in sweetpotato isr tissue sections  and with reports of accelerated cell division upon sr initiation in other sweetpotato varieties  <cit> . these results are novel and additional work is needed to characterize the spatial expression of these genes in root sections at different time points during and following sr initiation.

genes down-regulated during initiation of sr formation
to identify root functions and processes that are down-regulated during the development of frs into srs, we looked into genes represented by contigs that exhibit significantly higher fold-change expression in frs compared to isrs. the list of  <dig> contigs exhibiting highest differential expression in frs compared to isrs is summarized in table  <dig>  this list contains a relatively large number of non-annotated contigs, in addition to contigs that represent genes involved in root development and function as well as defense, such as a metallothionein-like protein which has been shown in rice to be involved in root formation  <cit>  and was found to exhibit a high read number . metallothioneins are cysteine-rich metal-binding proteins of low molecular mass that are mainly involved in maintaining metal homeostasis, metal detoxification and stress/defense responses  <cit> . additional genes known to be involved in stress response  and found to exhibit down-regulated expression in isrs compared to frs included an osmotin-like protein  and pathogenesis-related protein pr10a , as well as a cysteine protease shown to be involved in senescence and the osmotic stress response  <cit> .

expression values are expressed as normalized read number. ‘fold change’ is calculated as fr reads/isr reads. one annotation is given for each contig. annotations of the two best hits for each contig  are available in additional file  <dig>  isr, initiating storage root, fr, fibrous root. * - read counts were changed from zero to one to enable ‘fold change’ calculation.

in addition, contig s_pbl_c <dig>  which showed an over 100-fold higher read number in frs compared with srs, was found to exhibit significant homology to peroxidase 10-like mrna  of vitis vinifera  and ricinus communis , involved in the phenylpropanoid and lignin biosynthesis pathways. angiosperm lignins are complex phenolic polymers that consist mostly of guaiacyl and syringyl units, together with small or trace amounts of p hydroxyphenyl units. monolignols are synthesized in the cytosol and transported to the cell wall, where their oxidation generates lignins  <cit> . from a functional point of view, lignins impart strength to cell walls, facilitate water transport, and impede the degradation of wall polysaccharides, thus acting as a major line of defense against pathogens, insects, and other herbivores  <cit> . in sweetpotato, togari  <cit>  proposed a direct link between lignification and sr initiation, suggesting that lignification inhibits sr development. the relationship between stele lignification and inability of adventitious roots to develop into srs has also been observed by wilson and lowe  <cit> , belehu et al.  <cit>  and villordon et al.  <cit> . togari  <cit>  suggested that genetic and environmental factors influence the balance between cambium development and lignification, which in turn determines to a large degree the final sr yield. indeed, looking into the expression levels of contigs representing additional lignin biosynthesis genes not included in table  <dig>  such as s_pbl_c <dig>  s_pbl_c <dig> and s_pbl_lrc <dig>  representing coumaroyl-coa synthase, caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferase and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, respectively, more than sevenfold reduced expression in isrs compared to frs was detected . this gene-expression pattern parallels the reduced lignification observed in tissue sections of isrs compared to frs . in this context of potential cross talk between establishment and development of the cambium meristem on the one hand, and lignification on the other, it is interesting to note that data from studies on a specific peach class i knotted-like gene  suggest that knope <dig> prevents cell lignification by repressing lignin genes during peach stem primary growth  <cit> .

validation of differential expression between isrs and frs revealed by the use of illumina-based sequencing at the cdna level
the validity of the expression differences detected by illumina-based sequencing was examined at the rna level, using on-line quantitative  rt-pcr. results for nine selected contigs are presented , representing five groups of genes that were found to be differentially expressed by the illumina results: a gene encoding sporamin, a sweetpotato storage protein accounting for about 60% of total soluble proteins, genes encoding enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis , genes regulating meristem identity , a gene involved in cell division regulation  and genes encoding enzymes of lignin biosynthesis . results are presented as relative expression values of the respective genes in the isr sample relative to their expression in the fr sample. in all cases tested, the qrt-pcr analyses confirmed the results of the illumina analyses , namely elevated expression of gene sequences involved in starch biosynthesis and sporamin accumulation, of the gene encoding cdk and of genes belonging to the class-i knotted-like homeobox protein family, and down-regulation of genes encoding enzymes of lignin biosynthesis in isrs. however, some of the relative expression values differed between the two expression analysis methods. for example, relative expression values detected by the illumina and qrt-pcr methods for cdk, 4cl and cad were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. it should be noted that the illumina-based expression results were derived from one biological replicate of the isr sample and one biological replicate of the fr sample , while the qrt-pcr results were derived from at least four biological replicates . overall, the qrt-pcr results validated the illumina-based cdna sequencing results, allowing for the interpretation of global gene expression trends. independent validations are still required to accurately measure the expression of each gene of interest.

analysis of over-represented go terms in the subset of differentially expressed contigs, in either isrs or frs, relative to the root transcriptome database
the differentially expressed contigs in isrs and frs were analyzed for go-category enrichment relative to the root transcriptome database using agrigo  <cit> . the results for the up-regulated contigs in isrs are presented in figure  <dig> and additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  the up-regulated contigs in isrs were found to contain  <dig> significantly enriched  go functional terms in the biology process category, including three ‘level 3’ and four ‘level 4’ terms . the highly enriched  “carbohydrate metabolic process” term included several contigs of starch phosphorylase, phosphoglucomutase, starch branching enzyme and  <dig> -β-glucosidase, and its daughter terms included “monosaccharide metabolic process”  and “starch biosynthetic process” . the results thus point to enrichment in isrs of carbohydrate metabolism and starch biosynthesis functions, in accordance with the biochemical analysis results indicating starch accumulation at the time of sr initiation . an additional and interesting enriched term was “protein folding” , a ‘level 7’ term that included contigs of cyclophilin, peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, calnexin constans interacting protein  <dig>  heat-shock protein and chaperones, and was connected to the term “protein thiol-disulfide exchange” .

as for molecular function, the up-regulated contigs belonged to  <dig> significantly enriched go terms, including the ‘level 1’ term “nutrient reservoir activity” , containing several contigs of sporamin a and sporamin b precursors, the ‘level 2’ terms “lipid binding” , “enzyme inhibitor activity” , and the ‘level 3’ terms “transferase activity, transferring sulfur-containing groups”  and “peptidase inhibitor activity” . the most significantly enriched term was the ‘level 6’ term “phosphofructokinase activity” . “glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase , containing several contigs of adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase subunits α and β, was also significantly enriched . the go terms of “plastid”  and “chloroplast”  and their daughter terms were the most highly enriched in the cellular component category , in accordance with involvement of amyloplasts in sr starch accumulation. the “apoplast” term  was also found to be significantly enriched in the isr sample .

the up-regulated contigs in frs were found to represent a larger number of different enriched go functional categories  compared to isrs . among the enriched terms represented by the up-regulated contigs in frs, a total of  <dig> terms were included in the bp category, containing the ‘level 2’ terms “oxidation reduction” , “small molecule metabolic process” , “response to stress” , “response to biotic stimulus” , “response to chemical stimulus”  and “secondary metabolic process” , and the ‘level 3’ terms “response to endogenous stimulus”  and “transport” , which in turn included “transmembrane transport” . the enriched “secondary metabolic process” term exhibited high enrichment in “phenylpropanoid metabolic process” , “phenylpropanoid biosynthetic process” , “coumarin metabolic process” , “coumarin biosynthetic process” , “lignin metabolic process” , “phenylpropanoid catabolic process”  and “lignin catabolic process” . an interesting group of enriched functional terms  included: “meristem determinacy” , “meristem maintenance”  and “inflorescence meristem growth” , which contained several contigs representing at least three ultrapetala 1-like proteins. ultrapetala 1-like protein is a putative transcription factor that acts as a key negative regulator of cell accumulation in arabidopsis shoot and floral meristems  <cit> . the higher-plant shoot apical meristem is a dynamic structure that continuously produces cells which become incorporated into new leaves, stems and flowers. the maintenance of a constant flow of cells through the meristem depends on coordination of two antagonistic processes: self-renewal of the stem cell population and initiation of the lateral organs. this coordination is stringently controlled by gene networks that contain both positive and negative components. carles et al.  <cit>  defined the ultrapetala <dig>  gene as a key negative regulator of cell accumulation in arabidopsis shoot and floral meristems, because mutations in ult <dig> caused enlargement of inflorescence and floral meristems, the production of supernumerary flowers and floral organs, and a delay in floral meristem termination.

in the mf category, the up-regulated contigs belonged to  <dig> significantly enriched go terms, including electron carrier, transporter, antioxidant and catalytic activities, and binding. catalytic activity included “oxidoreductase activity” , which in turn included “oxidoreductase activity, acting on diphenols and related substances as donors, oxygen as acceptor” , “oxidoreductase activity, acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen, nadh or nadph as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen”  and “trans-cinnamate  <dig> monooxygenase activity” , as well as “oxidoreductase activity, acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen, 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom each of oxygen into both donors” , “naringenin 3-dioxygenase activity”  and “leucocyanidin oxygenase activity” . catalytic activity also included transferase activity which, in turn, included “glucosyltransferase activity” , “anthocyanidin 3-o-glucosyltransferase activity”  and “transferase activity, transferring acyl groups other than amino-acyl groups”  and “hydroxycinnamoyltransferase activity” . binding included “heme binding” , “cofactor binding” , including “fad binding”  as well as “transcription factor activity” .

it is interesting to note that the enriched term “transcription factor activity” included several ethylene-responsive factors, such as a homologue of tomato ethylene responsive transcriptional coactivator , ap2/erf domain-containing contigs, homologues of dehydration-responsive element binding protein, and ethylene-responsive transcription factor  <dig>  and erf <dig>  indicating involvement of ethylene in sweetpotato root development. the growth of secondary xylem and phloem depends on the division of cells in the vascular cambium and results in an increase in the diameter of the root. results of genome-wide expression profiling of xylem and phloem cambium isolated from the root hypocotyl of arabidopsis suggested a role for several members of the ap <dig> as well as myb transcription factor families, in addition to other transcription factors, as regulators of xylem or phloem cell differentiation and activity  <cit> . this “transcription factor activity” go term also contained r2r <dig> myb class transcription factor homologues, several gras <dig> and gras <dig> homologues, two bel <dig> homeotic protein homologues and a constans-like protein homologue. members of the gras family, such as the short-root protein, are key regulators of root radial patterning , meristem maintenance and asymmetric cell division , and have been found to be differentially expressed in srs of the sweetpotato cv. xushu <cit> .

the go terms “large ribosomal subunit” , “extracellular region”  and “intrinsic to membrane”  were found to be significantly enriched in the cc category .

analysis of kegg pathway enrichment in differentially expressed contigs of either isrs or frs, relative to the root transcriptome database
the differentially expressed contigs in isrs and frs were analyzed for kegg pathway enrichment, relative to the rest of the root transcriptome database, using fisher’s exact test and fdr correction  <cit> , and the results are presented in table  <dig>  four and fifteen pathways were found to be significantly enriched  in isr and fr, respectively.

enrichment analysis was done using fisher’s exact tests. p-value is given as an adjusted value following fdr correction .

looking into kegg-enriched pathways in isrs, enrichment of sulfur metabolism was apparent, with  <dig> enzymes exhibiting up-regulated expression in isrs compared to frs , including contigs representing sulfite reductase . interestingly, sulfite reductase has been recently suggested as a candidate gene with potential function in cassava sr formation  <cit> . reduced levels of sulfite reductase in the arabidopsis mutant sir <dig> with decreased activity of the enzyme led to decreased hexose and starch contents  <cit> . it is thus tempting to suggest that sulfite reductase may also have a role in the control of sr starch accumulation during sr initiation. the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway was also found to be significantly enriched in isrs . in cassava, regulatory changes in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway were demonstrated following sr development  <cit> . down-regulation of enolase, l-lactate dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase was suggested in cassava to slow down the entry of carbon into the citrate cycle, pyruvate metabolism and propanoate metabolism, leading to less glucose-6p converted to glycerate-3p and glucose-1p, and in most of the glucose-6p being transported into the amyloplast for starch and sucrose synthesis  <cit> . in sweetpotato, over twofold down-regulation of several contigs of pyruvate decarboxylase and lactate dehydrogenase was detected following initiation of sr formation , as well as more than twofold up-regulation of contigs of phosphoglucomutase , indicating the possibility of similar regulation.

among the significantly enriched pathways in frs, high enrichment was observed for the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway . the first three biosynthetic reactions in this pathway, referred to as the general phenylpropanoid pathway, produce p-coumaroyl coa, which is a major branch-point metabolite between the production of the flavonoids and the pathway that produces monolignols, lignans and hydroxy-cinnamate conjugates . the first of these reactions is the deamination of phenylalanine by phenylalanine ammonia-lyase  to generate trans-cinnamic acid. cinnamic acid is then para-hydroxylated by cinnamate 4-hydroxylase  to produce p-coumaric acid , which is then activated to its corresponding coa thioester by 4-coumarate coa ligase . all phenylalanine-derived units destined to be incorporated into the lignin polymer must be hydroxylated by c4h, because the p-hydroxy group is required for the activation of monolignols to their corresponding free radicals, and for polymerization into lignin. the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway map is presented in figure  <dig>  with the enzymes exhibiting up-regulated expression in isrs and frs marked in green and red, respectively. over twofold up-regulation in frs of contigs representing c4h and 4cl, as well as of contigs of coniferyl-alcohol glucosyltransferase was apparent . in addition, high expression of pal was detected in the fr sample, whereas an over fourfold reduction in read number was observed in the isr sample . the presence of several contigs representing these enzymes may indicate the presence of isoenzymes. 4cl catalyzes the formation of coa esters of caffeic acid, ferulic acid, 5-hydroxyferulic acid, and sinapic acid, in addition to p-coumaric acid . the plethora of additional potential substrates may explain why there are many 4cl isoenzymes in most plants. in addition to the different substrate specificities, the genes may have a distinct spatiotemporal expression pattern . looking into the read number of contigs representing genes of the lignin pathway, such as cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase , more than fivefold lower expression was detected in the isr vs. fr sample . taken together, the results indicate down-regulation in the expression of key genes of the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway upon the change in root fate from fr to a storage organ, which may be responsible for the significant reduction in lignin levels , representing novel data not previously described in sweetpotato. indeed, it has been demonstrated in arabidopsis and tobacco that down-regulating 4cl results in reduced lignin content  <cit> . hu et al.  <cit>  showed that down-regulating the expression of 4cl in transgenic aspen  by antisense inhibition causes up to 45% reduction in lignin. reductions in lignin content in arabidopsis plants carrying a mutation in the second enzyme of this pathway, c4h, were shown to accumulate decreased levels of several different classes of phenylpropanoid end products and to exhibit reduced lignin deposition, altered lignin monomer content and a collapsed xylem phenotype  <cit> .

isr, initiating storage root; fr, fibrous root. enzyme annotation was obtained from the sequence annotation and go classification data.

cross-talk between primary and secondary metabolism is well documented  <cit> . to activate the lignin biosynthesis pathway, carbon flow should be delivered from carbohydrate metabolism into the phenylpropanoid pathway by producing sufficient phenylalanine via the shikimate pathway. 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase  catalyzes the first step of the shikimate pathway, using phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose 4-phosphate derived from glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, respectively. it was thus interesting to note that more than fourfold down-regulation in read number of six contigs  representing this gene, was detected in isr compared to fr , suggesting reduction in carbon flow toward phenylpropanoid biosynthesis upon sr initiation.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, the generation of a database of georgia jet sweetpotato root transcriptome, together with a comparison of the expression profiles of isrs and frs, enabled the identification of genes involved in the earliest stage of sr formation. down-regulation in the expression of key genes of the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway upon the change in root fate from fr to a storage organ is indicated, which may be responsible for the significant reduction in lignin levels, representing novel data not previously described in sweetpotato.

the results highlight a reduction in carbon flow toward phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and its delivery into carbohydrate metabolism and starch biosynthesis as major events involved in sr initiation. specific genes in these pathways were pointed out, providing potential targets for sweetpotato genetic engineering. the results also emphasize the potential importance of delicate control at the level of gene expression of regulators of meristematic tissue identity and maintenance, up-regulation of cell-division regulators and down-regulation of specific gras family members, in the sr-initiation process, providing novel data with respect to the specific genes involved. in addition, this study adds a valuable resource of sweetpotato root transcript sequences to the available data, facilitating the identification of genes of interest in this food crop which is among the top seven most important food crops in the world.
