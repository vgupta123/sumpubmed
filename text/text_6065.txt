BACKGROUND
salmonellosis is one of the important causes of food-borne diseases throughout the world  <cit> . salmonella enterica contains more than  <dig>  serotypes among which typhimurium is an important causative agent of gastroenteritis. adhesion of bacteria to the host epithelial cells is a prerequisite step in establishing infection. specific adhesion requires the interaction of specialized complementary molecules in a ligand-receptor interaction between bacterial surfaces and host tissues  <cit> . proteinaceous hair-like structures called fimbriae on the surface of bacteria have been implicated in such an event  <cit> . many members of the family enterobacteriaceae including salmonella produce type  <dig> fimbriae, the most commonly found type of fimbrial appendages  <cit> . type  <dig> fimbriae comprise a family of rod-shaped organelles which are  <dig> nm in diameter and  <dig> – <dig>  μm long  <cit> . type  <dig> fimbriae adhere to different cell types including erythrocytes, leukocytes, intestinal cells, respiratory cells, protozoa, yeast, fungal hyphae, and plant root hairs  <cit> . several studies indicated that type  <dig> fimbriae also contribute to virulence  <cit> . for example, type  <dig> fimbriae expressing s. typhimurium caused persistent infection in swine  <cit> . type  <dig> fimbriae may also modulate the bacterial tropism to the gut of the host  <cit> , and type 1-fimbriated salmonella were more virulent than the fim-minus ones  <cit> . the fact that more than 80% of salmonella isolates produce this fimbrial type suggests that type  <dig> fimbriae play an important role at some stage in the life cycle of bacteria  <cit> .

phenotypic variation of the expression of type  <dig> fimbriae in s. typhimurium was first characterized by old et al.  <cit> . they described a biphasic growth pattern associated with the outgrowth of fimbriate bacteria incubated in static, liquid broth culture. briefly, strongly type  <dig> fimbriate phase s. typhimurium cells were isolated following serial passage every  <dig> h in static broth culture. non-fimbriate phase bacteria were obtained by growth on solid media.

current data indicate that the phenotypic expression of type  <dig> fimbriae in s. typhimurium is the result of the interaction and cooperation of several genes in the fim gene cluster  <cit> . the fimz transcriptional factor activates the fima expression by binding to the fima promoter, and in addition, fimz also positively regulates its own transcription  <cit> . fimz requires another co-activator fimy to activate fima expression, however, no evidence has revealed any interaction of fimy and the fima promoter  <cit> . interestingly, fimy gene possesses five rarely used arginine codon which is recognized by an arginine trna gene fimu. a s. typhimurium fimu mutant did not produce type  <dig> fimbriae and the fimy translation was inhibited  <cit> . fimu modulates the fimy expression in the translational level. a fimw deleted strain, on the contrary, overproduced type  <dig> fimbriae as compared to the parental strain. this negative regulation was proposed to be mediated through an inhibitory effect on the fimz protein by a fimw-fimz protein-protein interaction  <cit> . other than gene products within the fim gene cluster, mcfarland et al. recently reported that a knockout mutation in lrp, encoding the leucine-responsive regulatory protein , was non-fimbriated  <cit> . they demonstrated that lrp positively regulated type  <dig> fimbrial expression by binding to the promoter region of fimz  <cit> . other gene products that may play a role in type  <dig> fimbrial expression were seldom characterized. our long-term goal in the laboratory is focused on finding any genetic determinants, other than those previously described within the fim gene cluster, which may also play a role in the phenotypic expression of type  <dig> fimbriae in s. typhimurium. initially we were interested in characterizing the genetic elements that may be associated with the ability of s. typhimurium to switch type  <dig> fimbrial expressions in response to solid agar and static broth culture conditions. we used transposon mutagenesis to generate a library for s. typhimurium and screened mutants that exhibited different type  <dig> fimbrial phenotypes than the parental strain between solid agar and static broth culture conditions. the flanking dna fragments of the transposon insertion sites in the mutants of interest were cloned and sequenced. herein, we report on the genetic determinants in s. typhimurium that may play a role in the regulation of type  <dig> fimbrial expression between solid agar and static broth culture conditions.

RESULTS
construction of a transposon mutant library of s. typhimurium
in order to identify any genetic determinant that is responsible for s. typhimurium to regulate type  <dig> fimbrial expression between solid agar and static broth cultures, we used a transposon mutagenesis technique to construct a transposon library. we obtained a library with approximately  <dig>  clones.

screening of s. typhimurium transposon mutants that exhibited different type  <dig> fimbrial phenotypes than the parental strain
in total,  <dig>  transposon mutants were screened for those which exhibited different type  <dig> fimbrial phenotypes as compared to the parental strain s. typhimurium lb <dig>  the expression of type  <dig> fimbriae was determined by yeast agglutination test. s. typhimurium lb <dig>  when grown in static broth culture for 36– <dig> h, agglutinated candida albicans on a glass slide. these bacterial cells produced type  <dig> fimbriae on the outer membrane when negatively stained with phosphotungstic acid and observed under electron microscopy . on the contrary, s. typhimurium lb <dig> did not agglutinate c. albicans on a glass slide when bacterial cells were prepared from solid agar medium grown for 16– <dig> h. the absence of agglutination correlated with the fact that no type  <dig> fimbriae were observed by electron microscopy . fifty-four mutants verified by southern blot to have a single unique transposon insertion were selected for further investigation . for those strains with multiple transposon insertions  were currently excluded from the present study. this could be due to partial digestion of the genomic dna or multiple transposons inserted into one bacterial strain. these  <dig> mutants no longer exhibited the same type  <dig> fimbrial phenotype as the parental strain, among which  <dig> mutants produced type  <dig> fimbriae in both culture conditions, while another  <dig> mutants produced type  <dig> fimbriae in neither culture condition. the genes inactivated in the mutants were identified by cloning and sequencing the dna fragments adjacent to the transposon insertion sites. the dna sequences were used to search against the genomic sequence of s. typhimurium. the position of the transposon insertion site was determined along with whether or not a transposon insertion site was located in or near an open reading frame , as predicted by the annotated genomic sequences. in the present study, we only focused on those mutants that demonstrated disruptions in orfs; these types of mutation are expected to disrupt the functions of the orfs involved. table  <dig> lists those mutants. transposons which disrupted between orfs were excluded in the present study.

a: the gene that was disrupted by the transposon insertion is listed. the annotation of s. typhimurium lt <dig> genome is used if the transposon insertion was present in a gene which is uncharacterized and unnamed.

classification of the mutants according to the functions or putative functions of genes disrupted by the transposon insertions
the  <dig> mutants listed in table  <dig> were classified according to the functions or putative functions of the orfs disrupted by the transposons. we classified the mutants into the  <dig> categories: fimbrial biosynthesis and regulation, putative cytoplasmic protein, global regulator protein, cell membrane associated protein, cell envelope associated protein, periplasmic protein, ribosome modulation factor, type iii secretion system protein, prophage-derived protein, sensor protein, transcription termination factor, and enzymes. nine mutants that had defects in fima, fimc, fimd, fimh, fimy, fimz, lpfb, pefi, and stbc were placed in the fimbrial biosynthesis and regulation category. fima is the major subunit of the type  <dig> fimbrial shaft, while the adhesion protein, fimh, confers the binding specificity of type  <dig> fimbriae  <cit> . fimc and fimd serve as the chaperone and molecular usher for type  <dig> fimbriae  <cit> . fimz and fimy are positive regulators of fima  <cit> . since all these genes are involved in type  <dig> fimbrial biosynthesis and regulation, disruption of these genes caused the mutants to produce no fimbriae at all in either culture condition. three mutants produced type  <dig> fimbriae in both culture conditions and had transposons inserted in other fimbrial related genes. k <dig> had a defect in lpfb, the chaperone protein for long polar fimbriae  <cit> . k <dig> had a defect in pefi, which involves the regulation of plasmid-encoded fimbriae  <cit> . k <dig> had a transposon inserted in stbc that encodes an outer membrane usher protein for stb fimbriae in s. typhimurium. the usher protein facilitates anchoring the developing fimbrial structure to the outer membrane  <cit> .

the k <dig> and k <dig> mutants exhibited type  <dig> fimbriae in both static broth and on solid agar media. the gene products involved are putative cytoplasmic proteins, and their functions remain to be characterized. the k <dig> mutant had a transposon inserted in the hupa gene whose product is the histone-like dna-binding protein, hu, a small, basic, thermostable protein involving dna replication  <cit> . the k <dig> mutant and another mutant k <dig> that has disruption in lrp encoding leucine-responsive regulatory protein  did not exhibit type  <dig> fimbriae in either culture condition. membrane associated proteins possess transmembrane domains. k <dig> had interruption of yhjv encoding protein similar to the tryptophan/tyrosine permease family in escherichia coli  <cit> . the putative protein affected in k <dig> is a sodium/glucose cotransporter protein which belongs to a superfamily of membrane proteins responsible for the uphill transport of substrates coupled to the downhill transport of na+  <cit> . the mgtb and nark genes, defective in k <dig> and k <dig> respectively, are involved in mg2+ and nitrate/nitrite transportation, respectively  <cit> . disruption of the rmf gene impaired the 70s ribosome dimerization and resulted in inhibition of s. typhimurium to produce type  <dig> fimbriae as seen in k <dig>  <cit> . the ssab, ssav, and invb belong to members of the type iii secretion system, which is important in the pathogenesis of s. typhimurium. the ssab and ssav mutants did not produce type  <dig> fimbriae in either culture condition, whereas the invb mutant produced type  <dig> fimbriae in both culture conditions. two mutants, k <dig> and k <dig>  possessed insertions in genes involved in synthesis of putative phage tail proteins  <cit> . k <dig> had an insertion in the gene encoding for a type iii translocated protein, ssei, carried by the prophage gifsy- <dig>  <cit> . two mutants, k <dig> and k <dig>  had transposons inserted into genes which encode the sensor part of the two-component regulatory system. ssra is associated with the type iii secretion system for the pathogenicity island ii  <cit> , while yehu in s. typhimurium remains to be characterized. nusa binds to the rna polymerase core enzyme and functions as a transcription termination factor  <cit> . the k <dig> carrying transposon in nusa did not produce type  <dig> fimbriae in either culture condition.

among the mutants,  <dig> of  <dig> mutants  were in the category of enzymes comprising the largest group of the mutants. the enzymes detected in these mutants could be further divided into endoribonuclease , restriction-modification enzyme , protease , trna modification enzyme , the enzyme for lipopolysaccharide synthesis , and primarily the enzymes required for general metabolism.

complementation test
a: phenotypic expression of type  <dig> fimbriae was determined by mannose-sensitive yeast agglutination test.

reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  analysis
total rna from the parental strain s. typhimurium lb <dig>  k <dig> ubib mutant, and k <dig> ubib  were prepared and analyzed for fima mrna and 16s rrna expression by rt-pcr. figure  <dig> showed the rt-pcr analysis results. as for the parental strain lb <dig>  the fima expression obtained from the static broth was approximately  <dig>  fold  of that obtained from the agar culture condition. for the k <dig> ubib mutant, expression of fima  was about 60%  of the fima . when k <dig> ubib strain harboured the plasmid pubib, fima expression  was about  <dig>  fold  of fima . as a control, 16s rrna was constantly expressed in all the strains tested.

discussion
it is not surprising that many bacterial fimbriae have the ability to switch expression from a fimbriate to a non-fimbriate phenotype. since bacterial population may face unpredictable milieu during their life cycle, having cells in both fimbriate and non-fimbriate phases offers the bacterial population an advantage of surviving in the diverse situations it will encounter  <cit> . the mechanisms that control the fimbrial regulation have been described in detail for only few fimbrial types. for example, the regulation in e. coli type  <dig> fimbriae is primarily controlled by inversion of a 314-bp segment of dna  upstream of the fima gene coding for the major fimbrial subunit  <cit> . accessory proteins including the integration host factor , lrp and the histone-like nucleoid-structuring  protein, also bind to the fim switch region to re-orientate the dna into a configuration favourable for inversion  <cit> . interestingly, the e. coli k- <dig> strain also possesses the sfm gene cluster , which is the orthologue of s. typhimurium fim gene cluster  <cit> . nevertheless not much characterization has been performed on sfm. the control system for type  <dig> fimbriae in s. typhimurium differs from that of e. coli. no dna inversion event has been detected and several fim gene products have been implicated as regulators of type  <dig> fimbrial expression  <cit> . previous studies did not reveal that global regulator like ihf or h-ns play a role in s. typhimurium type  <dig> fimbrial expression. in order to explore other elements outside the fim gene cluster that might also participate in type  <dig> fimbrial expression, we constructed a transposon library of s. typhimurium. from the mutants that no longer exhibited the same type  <dig> fimbrial phenotypes as the parental strain whether grown on solid agar and in static broth cultures,  <dig> groups were classified according to the putative functions of the genes that were interrupted by the transposons. not surprisingly, several mutants that had defects in the fim genes did not produce type <dig> fimbriae in either condition. the mutants possessing transposons in fima, fimc, fimd, fimh, fimz, and fimy all exhibited the predicted phenotypes. these fim genes are required for type  <dig> fimbrial biogenesis or regulation, and disruption of these genes causes the bacteria to be non-fimbriate in either condition. interestingly, the present study identified  <dig> mutants that had defective genes for other fimbrial systems, and they produced type  <dig> fimbriae in both culture conditions. k <dig> had a transposon inserted in stbc that encodes the fimbrial usher protein for stb fimbriae  <cit> . k <dig> had insertion in fimbrial chaperone protein for long polar fimbriae . those two gene products are involved in fimbrial biogenesis. how disruption of the outer membrane usher gene, stbc, of the stb fimbrial system affects another fimbrial system poses an interesting research topic. we did try to complement the stbc mutant with a recombinant plasmid possessing the stbc coding sequence. however, the stbc mutant exhibited resistance to a battery of antibiotics, including ampicillin and chloramphenicol those frequently used in molecular cloning. this unexpected finding impeded us to transforming available plasmids into this strain for the time being. pefi identified in k <dig> is the homolog of papi in e. coli. pefi negatively regulates the production of pefa, the major fimbrial subunit of plasmid-encoded fimbriae   <cit> . cross-talk between different fimbrial systems within the same microorganism has been demonstrated previously. for example, minor fimbrin of type  <dig> and f1c fimbriae of e. coli can be reciprocally exchanged to generate hybrid fimbriae with changed receptor specificities  <cit> . the regulator papb of pyelonephritis-associated pili  prevents inversion of the fim switch controlling the expression of type  <dig> fimbriae in the same e. coli strain  <cit> . recently nuccio et al. also demonstrated that the presence of type  <dig> fimbrial biosynthesis genes interfered with the expression of plasmid-encoded fimbriae in s. typhimurium  <cit> . although additional research is required to elucidate the interaction of different fimbrial systems, our results did stress the observation that different types of fimbriae may coordinate for their own benefit.

a global regulator, lrp, has been demonstrated to play a role in the regulation of both type  <dig> fimbriae and p fimbriae of e. coli and pef of s. typhimurium. recently mcfarland et al. demonstrated that an lrp knockout s. typhimurium strain did not produce type  <dig> fimbriae and lrp is a positive regulator for fim gene expression by interacting with the fimz promoter region  <cit> . fimz is a positive regulator for fima  <cit> . their data suggested that a positive contribution of fim gene expression by lrp/fimz promoter interaction may be due to the displacement of h-ns, a repressor for fimz  <cit> . the k <dig> mutant with the transposon inserted into lrp did not produce type  <dig> fimbriae in either culture condition. our result concurred with their finding. the role that lrp plays in terms of type  <dig> fimbrial regulation in s. typhimurium becomes apparent.

several s. typhimurium strains had transposons inserted in the genes that encode enzymes. the k <dig> strain had a defect in cafa that encodes a ribonuclease named rnase g in e. coli. umitsuki et al. reported that rnase g was involved in the in vivo degradation of adhe mrna which encodes a fermentative alcohol dehydrogenase, adhe  <cit> . a mutation at cafa resulted in accumulation of adhe mrna and prolonged the half-life of its mrna. interestingly, the k <dig> strain had a mutation in the gene that encodes alcohol dehydrogenase. the k <dig> strain constitutively expressed type  <dig> fimbriae. overexpression of adhe inhibited type  <dig> fimbrial expression, while the absence of adhe caused type  <dig> fimbrial expression on solid agar or in static broth. how an enzyme involved in metabolism influences fimbrial expression is not clear, but previous studies demonstrated that type  <dig> fimbrial expression was linked to the nutrient status of the bacterial encounter. broth culture supplemented with glucose favours shigella flexneri remaining in a non-fimbriate state  <cit> . morgenroth and duguid described a s. typhimurium biotype called the firn strain; it is non-type  <dig> fimbriate, non-inositol-fermenting, and non-rhamnose-fermenting  <cit> . the genes controlling fimbrial expression may be linked to the genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. interestingly, similar to the k <dig> strain, a variety of mutants in the present study having transposons inserted in the genes encoding "house-keeping" enzymes all constitutively exhibited type  <dig> fimbriae. barak et al. used transposon mutagenesis to identify genetic determinants required for s. newport to attach to plant tissue  <cit> . they also found that alcohol dehydrogenase, hydrolase, bacteriophage protein, and several membrane associated proteins, including transporter protein, similar to our findings, were the essential components for this salmonella serotype to adhere to plant tissue  <cit> . the ability of salmonella to colonize plant tissue and modulate type  <dig> fimbrial expression may share a common regulatory network.

a complementation test allowed us to examine if providing the coding sequence of the gene carried in a plasmid back to the mutant stain defective in such a gene would switch the phenotype of type  <dig> fimbrial expression to that originally observed. a comprehensive complementation test is not within the scope of the present study; however, we did test some strains. the complemented k <dig> cafa , k <dig> miaa , and k <dig> nusa  strains did not exhibit the type  <dig> fimbrial phenotype as the parental strain. polar effect caused by the transposon could be one of the reasons. another possibility could be due to the gene dosage effect conferred by the cloning vector. the k <dig> res  strain did repress the type  <dig> fimbrial production on solid agar as the parental strain lb <dig>  however, in static broth culture, the complemented strain did not exhibit type  <dig> fimbriae. the res gene, encoding for the restriction subunit of type iii restriction-modification  system of s. typhimurium, locates upstream of the mod gene which encodes the methyltransferase subunit of r-m system. since res subunit requires mod to form a complex to recognize and cleave dna  <cit> , failure of mod expression caused by polar effect could account for the partially complemented phenotype of the k5res  strain. nusa is a transcription termination factor and under some circumstance it may also function as a transcription elongation factor  <cit> . the ability of nusa to enhance rna polymerase pausing would result in tight coupling of transcription and translation, thus interferes with the rho-mrna interactions and consequently blocks termination of transcription  <cit> . the transposon inserted in nusa in k <dig> strain could cause transcription/translation coupling defect in a variety of genes including those that may affect fim expression. the pnusa transformed in k <dig> strain may not produce precise stoichiometric ration of nusa, leading k <dig> nusa  strain remained unchanged as the k <dig> nusa strain. miaa is an isopentenylpyrophosphate transferase that is required for trna modification. ericson and björk demonstrated that a miaa mutant in s. typhimurium lt <dig> which was deficient in 2-methylthio-n6- adenosine  in its trna induced pleiotropic effects on bacterial physiology such as reduced growth rate and polypeptide chain elongation rate  <cit> . non-fimbriate phenotype exhibited by k <dig> miaa strain in both culture conditions could be the result of such pleiotropic effects. the k <dig> ubib mutant transformed with the pubib plasmid restored the type  <dig> fimbrial phenotype as the parental strain lb <dig>  the k <dig> ubib  cultured on agar did not agglutinate yeast cells. although signals of both lb <dig> and k <dig> ubib  from agar could be detected by densitometry in rt-pcr assay, we argued that such fima amount would not be enough for scoring positive in yeast agglutination test. our complementation assay did prove that the ubib mutant could exhibit the same phenotype as lb <dig> when it harboured a plasmid containing the coding sequence of ubib. the ubib in s. typhimurium could encode a nadh-flavin-reductase, whose homologue in e. coli has been proved to be required for the first monooxygenase step in ubiquinone biosynthesis  <cit> . how a gene involving in biosynthesis of ubiquinone, an essential component of electron transport chain influences type  <dig> fimbrial expression is currently unknown. however, leonard et al. reported that ubib protein contains motifs found in eukaryotic-type protein kinase  <cit> . it was speculated that phosphorylation may be required for ubiquinone biosynthesis-activating proteins  <cit> . possibly ubib would also phosphorylate another substrate protein that affects fima expression. the function of ubib in s. typhimurium and the relationship of ubib and fim expression demands more careful characterization. our data clearly showed that an ubib mutant produced fima at the condition that either favours or inhibits type  <dig> fimbrial expression and complementing this mutant with a plasmid possessing ubib coding sequence restored it to the phenotype similar to the parental strain.

the present study revealed that the genetic determinants other than the fim genes could have the potential to affect type  <dig> fimbrial expression in response to different standard laboratory culture conditions. however, a battery of genes identified by transposon mutagenesis still requires detail characterization to validate its linkage to fimbrial expression. the phenotype caused by polar effect is one of the drawbacks in this kind of study. validation of the genes of interest that are associated with type  <dig> fimbrial expression in s. typhimurium is presently under investigation in our laboratory.

CONCLUSIONS
the ability to switch between fimbrial expressions in bacteria may be beneficial for survival. fimbriate bacteria may facilitate colonizing host cells at certain stages of infection, while non-fimbriate bacteria may also have their own role to play, for example, as in avoiding recognition by phagocytes, or allowing the bacteria to shed and colonize another site on the host. compared to e. coli, salmonella has a higher survival rate in the external environment, which promotes transmission to a new host  <cit> . persistent infection of salmonella in the environment is enhanced by adhesion and biofilm formation, both of which involve fimbrial appendages  <cit> . how s. typhimurium fluctuates between type  <dig> fimbriate phase and non-fimbriate phase in vivo remains to be uncovered. nonetheless the present study reveals that several genetic determinants may be associated with the ability of s. typhimurium to modulate type  <dig> fimbrial expression between solid agar and static broth culture conditions. these two laboratory culture conditions may to some extent mimic the environmental milieu that salmonella would encounter. we report here that other gene products besides those in the fim gene cluster are also required for type  <dig> fimbrial expression. how each gene influences type  <dig> fimbrial expression is an interesting research topic which warrants further investigation.
