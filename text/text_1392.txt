BACKGROUND
cerebral strokes due to ischemic, embolic and hemorrhagic insults are common neurological conditions that cause brain damage and functional loss. associated with or subsequent to these insults are broad host responses at molecular and cellular levels involving both the neuronal and non-neuronal components of the brain. for instance, stroke-related anatomical/pathological changes may include infiltration of blood cells, angiogenesis and activation/proliferation of glial cells  <cit> . in addition, recent studies indicate that neurogenesis may be induced or activated following vascular insults, which may be important for neuronal regeneration and functional recovery  <cit> . thus, understanding the cellular mechanism underlying stroke-associated neurogenesis is of neurobiological as well as neurological/medical implications.

one of the key issues related to stroke-induced neurogenesis concerns the origin of cells that may give rise to new neurons. it is currently considered that neurogenesis in the adult brain occurs in restricted areas under physiological conditions, namely the subventricular zone  and subgranular zone   <cit> . however, stroke and trauma-induced neurogenesis have been described in broad brain regions/sites than the svz/sgz  <cit> . of interest, bone marrow cells may differentiate into various types of peripheral cells and likely neurons as well  <cit> . there is evidence from humans and laboratory animals that new neurons in the brain may arise from putative blood-borne cells  <cit> . it appears that putative bone marrow cells may be particularly important for adult neurogenesis following stroke or traumatic brain injury  <cit> . less is known with regard to the seeding and early phase of proliferation or neuronal differentiation of bone marrow cells in the stroke-injured brain. to address these issues, we isolated bone marrow mononuclear cells  from adult mice, pre-labeled them with a lipophilic red fluorescence dye pkh <dig>  <cit> , and tracked these cells in vivo following transfusion into mice with middle cerebral coagulation. we detected colocalization around the infarct site of pkh26-labeled cells with the endogenous cell division marker, proliferating cell nuclear antigen , and with the immature neuronal marker doublecortin   <cit> . these data appear to support that bone marrow cells may be one of the important sources of stem cells involved in neurogenesis following acute cerebral vascular injury, and that transplantation of these cells is of potential clinical utility in the management of stroke.

RESULTS
cytofluorometric characterization of bone marrow cell preparations
four fluorescence-activated cell sorting  analyses were used to determine the expression of various signature antigen markers of mesenchymal stem cells on the isolated cells . in brief,  <dig> % of the isolated cells expressed cd <dig> ;  <dig> % expressed cd <dig> ;  <dig> % expressed stem cell marker, sca- <dig> ; and  <dig> % expressed cd <dig> . taken together, the data implicated that the isolated bone marrow cells exhibited a panel of surface antigens characteristic of the haemopoietic stem cell population  <cit> . in other words, the bone marrow cells derived from balb/c mouse long bones appeared to be largely bmmcs according to established evaluation protocols  <cit> .

distribution of transplanted bone marrow cells around cerebral infarct
in the present study we established focal cerebral ischemia/infarction under visually guided local occlusion of cerebral artery. to confirm the effect of unilateral electric coagulation of the middle cerebral artery, a group of animals were sacrificed  <dig> hours after the surgery, and their brains were removed without perfusion and were cut in ~ <dig> mm thick coronal slices . gross appearance of focal ischemia was evident in the operated hemisphere, with a pale infarct area located around the lateral-middle portion of cerebrum. in h.e. stained sections from these brains, signs of tissue necrosis were present in and around the infarct, including vacuolation, shrunken neurons and eosinophilic cytoplasm .

in our pilot studies, we looked pkh <dig> fluorescent signal  <dig> to  <dig> weeks post bone marrow cells transplantation in the ischemic and control brains. fluorescent cells were detectable in the former group up to ~ <dig> weeks, but tended to fade afterwards . in normal control brain, only a very few fluorescent cells were encountered , suggesting increased infiltration of blood cells after vascular injury. for these reasons, histological and immunohistochemical analyses were carried out at  <dig> and  <dig> weeks post cell transplant. thus, at the one week surviving time point, a large number of pkh26-labeled cells were found in the ischemic brains, which were located primarily around the border of the infarct area and the peripheral healthy regions in the cortex, or the infarct penumbra . these cells were small in size and appeared often in group or cluster . no apparent cellular processes were visible on these cells. in all examined brain sections from animals received pbs as vehicle control, no pkh26-labeled cells were found .

colocalization of transplanted bone marrow cells with pcna
immunolabeling for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen  was used to detect in situ cell proliferative activity in the ischemic mouse cortex. a large number of pcna immunoreactive nuclei were present at the junction of the infarct site to the peripheral, relatively healthy, areas at  <dig>  and  <dig>  weeks post cerebral artery occlusion. fewer labeled cells were also seen interior to this border  . pcna immunoreactive profiles were all cell nuclei as confirmed by haematoxylin counterstain, and they exhibited variable labeling intensity and sizes. in addition, some of pcna labeled nuclei appeared to occur in pair .

in order to explore if transplanted bone marrow cells might be a part of the proliferating cells seen around the infarct areas, we carried out double labeling analysis for colocalization of pcna  and pkh <dig>  in the brains examined  <dig> week after bone marrow cell transplant, most pkh26-labeled cells were found to colocalize with pcna  immunoreactivity. similar to the above described distribution of cells labeled by pkh <dig> or pcna, the double-labeled cells occurred predominantly around the infarct penumbra. many of the double-labeled cells appeared in pair or in small cluster, optimal for a morphochemical pattern of actively proliferating cells .

colocalization of transplanted bone marrow cells with doublecortin
doublecortin  is an immature neuronal marker expressed by newborn neurons in the subventricular and subgranular zones in the adult mammalian brain  <cit> . dcx labeling can be used to detect recently-generated immature neurons after traumatic injury ischemia in the brain including the cerebral cortex  <cit> . we used this marker to explore if transplanted bone marrow cells might differentiate toward neuronal phenotype in the ischemic mouse cerebral cortex. in double fluorescent preparations, we did not detect clear colocalization of dcx among pkh26-labeled cells at  <dig> week post bone marrow cell transplant . however, in sections from animals survived for two weeks, some pkh26-labeled cells appeared to colocalize with dcx. these double-labeled cells were again found around the infarct penumbra. some of the double-labeled cells had relatively large somal size with visible dendrite-like processes, suggestive of a neuronal morphology . among the colocalized cells, those with larger somata expressed weaker pkh <dig> fluorescence relative to the ones with smaller size . thus, there appeared to be a trend of reduction or dilution of pkh <dig> labeling with cell growth. overall, the morphology of the double-labeled cells resembled interneurons rather large pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex  <cit> . in longer surviving time point , we failed to detect double-labeled cells likely because of the fading of pkh <dig> fluorescence with time .

discussion
significant advance has been made during recent years in the field of stem cell therapy  <cit> . because pluripotent bone marrow stem cells can be obtained from a given individual and transplanted in a form of autograft following potential in vitro expansion, these cells are considered to be of particular medical use for tissue/organ repair  <cit> . in many peripheral organs, transplantation of bone marrows stromal cells appear to facilitate tissue regeneration and improve functional recovery following acute injury and even under certain chronic degenerative conditions  <cit> . bone marrow stem cells are also considered to be useful in the treatment of acute brain injury and certain degenerative neurological disorders  <cit> . in animal models of cerebral stroke and traumatic injury bone marrow cell therapy show beneficial effects, as evidenced by improved histological outcome and neurological performance  <cit> .

evidence exists in supportive of an involvement of putative blood-borne cells, likely stromal stem cells, in neurogenesis in mature mammalian brain. in humans as well as animals, mature neurons containing y-chromosome are detected in the cerebrum of females that have received blood from males  <cit> . it appears that bone marrow stem cells might contribute to adult neurogenesis more significantly following brain injury. a number of previous studies report that transplanted bone marrow cells pre-labeled with brdu or retrovirus colocalize with mature neuronal  markers, such as map- <dig> and neun, in the cerebrum following ischemic injury  <cit> . however, few studies have investigated the early stage of development or transdifferentiation of the transplanted bone marrow cells in injured host brain.

in the present study, bone marrow cells are isolated from adult mouse long bone, and are subsequently characterized using a panel of haemopoietic stem cell markers. the isolated bone marrow cells express cd <dig> , cd <dig> , sca- <dig>  and cd <dig> , therefore confirming a phenotype of mesenchymal stem cells. then, a lipophilic marker pkh <dig> is used to pre-label the isolated bone marrow stem cells, which allow us to track a large population of these cells in vivo for a few weeks following transplantation. in the ischemic mouse cerebral cortex, most of the pkh26-labeled bone marrow stem cells are localized to the periphery or the penumbra of ischemic infarct. this distribution pattern suggests that the cells are likely released from the blood vessels of the neighboring healthy cortex, or alternatively that the cells survive better around the infarct penumbra because of a relatively intact blood supply. of note, we observe a considerable amount of proliferative activity in the same peri-infarct region, as reflected by pcna expression. moreover, there exists a great degree of colocalization between pcna and pkh <dig> around the infarct penumbra. therefore, the transplanted bone marrow stem cells might undergo in situ proliferation after they have seeded in the ischemic cerebral parenchyma.

importantly, by two weeks post transfusion many pkh26-labeled cells in the peri-infarct region colocalize with dcx, a marker of immature neurons  <cit> . the double-labeled cells are relatively small, have round or oval somata, and develop dendrite-like processes. the morphology of these double-labeled cells is more reminiscent of cortical interneurons rather than pyramidal neurons. a previous study also shows that bone-marrow cell derived neurons exhibit stellate, ramified or triangular morphologies  <cit> . another study demonstrates that newborn neurons in ischemic rat cortex co-express various markers of cortical interneurons  <cit> . thus, our findings are consistent with a notion that the transdifferentiated neurons from bone-marrow cells in the injured cerebrum are morphologically resembled cortical interneurons.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, following in vitro labeling of a large number of cells with the lipophilic marker pkh <dig>  the present study demonstrates that transplanted bone morrow cells relocate to and reside mostly around the infarct penumbra in a mouse model of ischemic cerebral stroke. these transplanted bone marrow cells might undergo certain extent of in situ proliferation, and they appear to transdifferentiate into putative cortical neurons during the first few weeks of experimental vascular injury.
