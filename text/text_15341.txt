BACKGROUND
common wheat  is the most important and widespread cultivated food crop in the world. the approximate global output of wheat was  <dig>  million tons in  <dig>  <cit> . wheat is an essential source of protein, vitamins, and minerals for humans. therefore, many studies, including genetic, genomic, and proteomic studies, have concentrated on improving wheat productivity. the genome of hexaploid wheat contains  <dig>  mb of dna originating from the natural hybridization of three genomes; a, b, and d  <cit> . it originated from the spontaneous hybridization of tetraploid emmer wheat  with diploid goat grass , while the triticum urartu  and bb genomes from an unknown species  naturally combined to form tetraploid emmer wheat  <cit> . the a, b, and d genomes show extensive and high conservation  <cit> . although the genome survey sequences of wheat  <cit> , triticum urartu  <cit> , and aegilops tauschii  <cit>  have been published, the reference sequences of the wheat genome have not been completed because of its complex polyploidy and homology. despite the lack of reference sequence information, major efforts are underway to increase the output of wheat by genetically analyzing its traits and increasing the genetic diversity of the breeding materials. at the same time, studies on the wheat proteome are underway, including research on transcription factors   <cit> .

transcription factors are proteins that are expressed in different organs, and at different developmental stages, in plants and animals. these proteins regulate the gene expression level by binding to cis-regulatory elements in the promoters of target genes to control various biological processes such as growth, cell division, and responses to the environment or stress  <cit> . the sequence region of tfs that binds to the target genes is the dna-binding domain . usually, tfs can be grouped into families according to the structural features of conserved dbds. some tf databases group tfs based on these families. a genome-wide comparative analysis of tfs in arabidopsis thaliana and other eukaryotic genomes was completed by riechmann et al., revealing  <dig> tfs in the a. thaliana genome  <cit> . subsequently, several plant tf databases have been established and are continuously updated; e.g., the riken arabidopsis transcription factor database   <cit> , the plant transcription factor database   <cit> , and the plant transcription factor database   <cit> . the latest version of plntfdb  contains tfs from  <dig> plant species, and includes tf databases of rice, sorghum, and maize  <cit> . planttfdb v <dig>  provides tf databases for  <dig> plant species, including african rice, barley, and wheat  <cit> .

in  <dig>  romeuf et al. constructed the first publicly available wheat tf database, the database of wheat transcription factors , by blastx alignment against rice tf sequences in the database of rice transcription factors   <cit> . wdbtf contains  <dig> putative wheat tf sequences belonging to  <dig> subfamilies. in the database, expression data and tissue source information are provided for individual sequences, and this information can be used to identify tissue-specific wheat tfs. however, the data in wdbtf have not been updated since  <dig>  the subsequently published wheat tf set in planttfdb v <dig>  included  <dig> tf sequences  <cit> . planttfdb v <dig>  listed additional information for each tf, including functional information such as the domain features, gene ontology  terms, and phylogenetic tree of the tf family. this database was updated to version  <dig>  in  <dig>  <cit> . at present, planttfdb v <dig>  includes information for  <dig> wheat tfs, which provides users with data to study their functions. however, the wheat tf sequences in planttfdb v <dig>  are not accompanied by data on tissue and developmental expression patterns, which is useful for studying the function and evolution of tfs  <cit> . thus, it is necessary to list tfs with information about their developmental- and tissue-specific expression patterns.

the objectives of this research were as follows:  to construct a wheat tf database that includes developmental- and tissue-specific expression information for individual tf sequences; and  to identify tfs that are specific to particular developmental stages and tissues.

RESULTS
in total,  <dig> wheat tfs obtained by hmm searches were classified into  <dig> families. among them,  <dig> families contained more than  <dig> tfs, which was the average number of tfs per family. there were  <dig> tfs predicted from singletons, accounting for  <dig> % of the  <dig> tfs . the number of tfs in each tf family in our database, wheattfdb, is shown in table  <dig>  the myeloblastosis  superfamily, including the myb and myb-related families, was the largest family, with  <dig> myb and  <dig> myb-related members. there were more than  <dig> members of the following families: ethylene responsive factor ; b3; basic helix-loop-helix ; basic region/leucine zipper motif ; nam, ataf, and cuc ; nuclear transcription factor y, gamma ; and wrky tf. the arr-b, srs, and ult families each had a single tf. there were no tfs in the hb-phd, homeodomain leucine zipper , hairy-related transcription-factor-like , leafy , nuclear transcription factor, x-box binding  <dig> , and nozzle/sporocyteless  families; therefore, these six families were removed from wheattfdb.table  <dig>

we surveyed the original developmental stage information of the  <dig> tfs. the details of the tfs expressed at different developmental stages are listed in additional file 2: table s <dig>  this table contains several columns: family, tf id, and presence at the dormant seed, germinating seed, reproductive, ripening, seedling, vegetative, and “unclear” developmental stages. the “family” column represents the  <dig> tf families mentioned above. the “tf id” column shows the accession numbers of the  <dig> tf sequences in wheattfdb. the presence of the tf at a given developmental stage is indicated by the value “1” in the relevant column . based on this definition, we identified  <dig> tfs at six developmental stages that regulate biological processes. these tfs included tatf <dig> in the alfin-like family; tatf <dig> in the bzip family; tatf <dig>  tatf <dig>  and tatf <dig> in the nf-yc family; tatf <dig> and tatf <dig> in the erf family; and tatf <dig> in the trihelix family . of the  <dig> tfs, we initially identified  <dig> putative developmental stage-specific tfs. the developmental stage information of these  <dig> putative specific tfs was validated by blast searches in the ncbi est database . we obtained  <dig>  subject sequences in the ncbi est database with the  <dig> putative tf sequences . however, only  <dig> of the subject sequences were matched sequences . we validated and updated the developmental stage information of the  <dig> putative specific sequences in additional file 2: table s <dig>  according to the blast results listed in additional file 4: table s <dig>  then, we obtained developmental stage information for the filtered-out tfs. as identified by hmm searches,  <dig> tfs were identified from the filtered-out sequences. each redundant tf sequence was clustered and matched to a tf sequence in the identified  <dig> tf set. then, we retrieved information on the developmental stage of the  <dig> filtered-out tfs. this resulted in new developmental stage information for  <dig> of the filtered-out sequences. this developmental stage data was added to additional file 2: table s <dig> .

when the value in the ninth column in additional file 2: table s <dig> was  <dig>  the tf was a stage-specific tf. we obtained  <dig> developmental stage-specific sequences in this study . the six large tf families  contained  <dig> tfs, accounting for  <dig> % of the  <dig> tfs. the arr-b, co-like, albumin d-binding protein , and ult families were unspecific wheat tf families, because these families did not include any specific tfs.table  <dig>

we identified  <dig> specific tf sequences at the dormant seed stage. the myb superfamily, erf, bzip, wrky, and mitochondrial transcription termination factor  families accounted for  <dig>  of the  <dig> specific tfs at the dormant seed stage. at the germinating seed stage, there were six stage-specific tfs belonging to four families; the nf-yc, hb-other, tubby , and cold shock domain  families had  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> sequence, respectively. we found  <dig> specific sequences in  <dig> families at the reproductive stage; the families with the most abundant transcripts were the b <dig>  erf, bhlh, mterf, and myb families, which together accounted for  <dig>  of the  <dig> tfs. in ripening wheat, there were  <dig> stage-specific sequences in  <dig> families, and the erf, nac, mterf, gras, hb-other, and myb families accounted for  <dig> % of the  <dig> sequences. at the seedling stage,  <dig> tfs belonging to  <dig> families were stage-specific tfs. of these,  <dig> tfs  belonged to the six most abundant families; the myb superfamily, and the erf, nac, wrky, bhlh, and bzip families. at the vegetative stage,  <dig> tfs belonging to  <dig> families were stage-specific, and the erf, nac, myb, wrky, nf-yc, and double b-box  families accounted for  <dig> % of the  <dig> stage-specific sequences. when the sum of “each tf present at dormant seed, germinating seed, reproductive, ripening, seedling, and vegetative stage” was equal to zero, and the value in the “unclear developmental stage” column was  <dig>  the developmental stage of the tf was unclear. there were  <dig> unclear tfs among the  <dig> tfs. the developmental stage information for these tfs should be confirmed in future research.

the tissue source information for the  <dig> tfs is summarized in additional file 6: table s <dig>  when the value in the ninth column was  <dig>  the tf was designated as a tissue-specific tf. we initially distinguished  <dig> putative tissue-specific tfs among the  <dig> wheat tfs . then, the tissue information of the  <dig> putative specific tfs was validated by blast searches in the ncbi wheat est database. we matched  <dig>  subject sequences with the  <dig> original ests that were putative tissue-specific sequences . there were  <dig> matched sequences among  <dig>  subject sequences . among these  <dig> sequences,  <dig> sequences had different tissue information from that listed with the  <dig> putative tissue-specific tfs. we updated the tissue information for these  <dig> specific tfs in additional file 6: table s <dig> . we also analyzed the tissue information for the  <dig> filtered-out tfs. in total,  <dig> new tissue information items for the filtered sequences were added to additional file 6: table s <dig> . finally,  <dig> tissue-specific sequences were obtained.

table  <dig> shows the number of wheat tissue-specific tfs in the  <dig> families. the first six subfamilies  contained  <dig>  of the  <dig> tfs, with each family containing more than  <dig> tfs. the arr-b, co-like, dbp, and ult families were unspecific tf families, and contained no tissue-specific tfs. as shown in table  <dig>   <dig> sequences belonging to  <dig> families were specific tfs in the crown. when we analyzed the families of the  <dig> crown-specific tfs, the three largest tissue-specific tf families in crown were the bhlh, wrky, and mterf families, containing  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> sequences, respectively. in the wheat flower,  <dig> tfs belonging to  <dig> families were tissue-specific tfs. of these,  <dig>  belonged to the myb superfamily and the b <dig>  erf, mterf, nac, and wrky families. in total,  <dig> specific tfs belonging to  <dig> families were identified in the wheat leaf. the nac, erf, myb superfamily, wrky, tify, and bhlh families were the six most abundant tf families, accounting for  <dig> % of the  <dig> leaf-specific tfs. there were  <dig> sequences belonging to  <dig> families that were specifically expressed in the wheat root. among them,  <dig>  were from the erf, bhlh, wrky, and bzip families and the myb superfamily. forty-two sequences in  <dig> families were specifically expressed in the wheat stem. the larger families, the myb superfamily and the mterf and bhlh families, accounted for  <dig>  of the total stem-specific wheat tfs. there were  <dig> tfs in  <dig> families that were exclusively expressed in the seed. the nac, erf, and hb-other families and the myb superfamily were the four largest families, accounting for  <dig> % of the  <dig> tfs. grünbaum’s seven-set venn diagram shows the distribution of tfs among the crown, flower, leaf, root, seed, stem, and other wheat tissues . additional file 5: figure s <dig> facilitates the interpretation of figure  <dig>  <cit> . the number of wheat tfs identified in the crown, flower, leaf, root, seed, stem, and other tissues was  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . twenty-nine tfs were expressed in the crown, flower, leaf, root, seed, and stem , including tatf <dig> in the arf family; tatf <dig> in the bhlh family; and tatf <dig> in the trihelix family. when the value of “sum of each tf appears at crown, flower, leaf, root, seed, and stem” was equal to zero and the value in the column for “other tissue” was  <dig>  the tissue type of the tf was designated as “other tissue”. of the  <dig> tfs in wheat,  <dig> were in the “other tissue” group .table  <dig>

the redundancies of tfs among wdbtf, planttfdb, and wheattfdb are shown in table  <dig>  wheattfdb did not have any redundant tfs above a similarity threshold of 95%, and planttfdb did not have any similar sequences at the 100% threshold. wdbtf showed various degrees of redundancy at the four similarity thresholds. there were  <dig> redundant tfs at a similarity threshold of 100%. at each similarity threshold, more redundant sequences were identified in wdbtf than in planttfdb and wheattfdb. the similarities in the three wheat tf databases were evaluated using the cdhit program. in all three databases, the number of similar sequences decreased as the similarity threshold increased. at the four similarity thresholds, the number of similar tfs was higher in wdbtf than in wheattfdb. there were  <dig> redundant sequences among the three tf databases at a similarity threshold of 100% . the  <dig> redundant tfs consisted of  <dig> sequences from wheattfdb,  <dig> from planttfdb, and  <dig> tfs from wdbtf, which were clustered as similar sequences at a similarity threshold of 100%.table  <dig>

in our new wheat tf database, wheattfdb, we have provided functional information for each individual tf, including the protein domain identification and go term assignment, which were obtained for the  <dig> identified tfs using interproscan v <dig> – <dig> . these annotations have been integrated into the page for each tfs in wheattfdb. additional file 9: table s <dig> shows the genomic sequence information for the tfs, including their id and chromosomal location. some tfs were mapped to several sites on different chromosomes because of similarity among the genomes of wheat and duplication of genes during evolution .

we constructed a wheat transcription factor database, wheattfdb , based on the  <dig> identified tfs. the tfs in wheattfdb are grouped into  <dig> families, as shown on the wheattfdb home page . the tf family names listed on the home page have been hyperlinked to individual tf family pages. the individual tf family pages show information about the tissue sources and developmental stages of each tf , and each tf is linked to its annotation page. the annotation page of each tf integrates information on domain structure, go annotation, protein features, and sequence . the additional files and tf sequences mentioned above have been deposited on the download page of wheattfdb .figure  <dig> 
the web interface of wheattfdb. the home page for wheattfdb shows the list of  <dig> wheat tf families . a typical page for a tf family displays the information of tissue resource and developmental stages of each tf . the annotation information of individual tfs mainly contains four categories: domain structures and repeats, detailed signature matches in intrerpro v <dig> , gene ontology term and sequence .



discussion
the wdbtf and wheat tf datasets in planttfdb v <dig>  provide useful information for studying the functions of tf sequences. to identify the tissue- and developmental stage-specific tfs, we constructed a new wheat tf database, wheattfdb. in wdbtf, wheat tfs were identified based on their dna-binding motifs. twelve dna-binding with one finger  genes were confirmed to be involved in wheat grain development  <cit> . the putative tfs belonging to the other  <dig> subfamilies still need to be verified experimentally. the accuracy of wheat tfs in planttfdb v <dig>  was tested using the methods described by iida et al.  <cit>  and riano-pachon et al.  <cit> . the results showed that the wheat tfs had acceptable accuracy  <cit> . the hmm profiles used in plntfdb and planttfdb have been verified, and have been used widely to identify tfs in other plants, for example rice, maize, and sorghum  <cit> . in this study, we used the same strategy to identify wheat tfs for wheattfdb as that used for plntfdb and planttfdb; therefore, the tf families in wheattfdb have acceptable accuracy, consistent with that of plntfdb and planttfdb.

we analyzed the redundancies and similarities within and among the three wheat tf databases . the redundancy in wdbtf is much higher than that in wheattfdb and planttfdb, as indicated by the higher number of redundant sequences in wdbtf at each threshold . the similarities at each threshold indicate that wdbtf is most similar to wheattfdb, and least similar to planttfdb, among the three databases. the three wheat tf databases provide  <dig> non-redundant tfs at a similarity of 100%. this value is the sum of the  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> tfs in each database, after subtracting the  <dig> redundant tfs. the  <dig> non-redundant tfs consist of  <dig> tfs from wheattfddb,  <dig> tfs from planttfdb, and  <dig> tfs from wdbtf. there are  <dig> tfs in wheattfdb that differ from those from planttfdb and wdbtf . therefore,  <dig> new tfs have been added to wheattfdb, compared with those published in planttfdb and wdbtf. there are  <dig> tfs in planttfdb and  <dig> tfs in wdbtf that are not listed in wheattfdb.

we calculated the percentages of tfs in the wheat genome in wheattfdb and wdbtf, and compared these values with those in other cereals . there are  <dig>  protein-coding genes in wheat, close to the number predicted by paux and rachel et al.  <cit> . when the number of tfs was divided by  <dig>  genes , the percentage of tfs was higher in wdbtf than in wheattfdb and planttfdb v <dig>  , because wdbtf has the highest number of tfs among the three wheat tf databases. in total, the three wheat tf databases predict  <dig> tfs, accounting for  <dig> % of the  <dig>  wheat protein-coding genes. this percentage is higher than that expected for plants   <cit> . this result indicates that the three wheat tf databases contain redundant sequences, especially wdbtf . thus, further experimental evidence is needed to confirm whether a predicted tf sequence is a tf or not.

transcription factors have been shown to regulate gene expression, and are often expressed in specific tissues or at during specific developmental stages  <cit> . some research on wheat tfs has focused on the function and/or evolution of several members of a particular tf family under various stress conditions  <cit> . there have also been studies on the molecular mechanisms of the responses of specific tfs to various abiotic or biotic conditions; such information may be used to improve the yield and quality of wheat through molecular breeding  <cit> . however, the systematic identification of wheat specific tfs in all of the tf families had not been performed. in this study, we identified  <dig> tfs specific to different developmental stages and  <dig> tissue-specific tfs, accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the  <dig> wheat tfs, respectively. these results may facilitate studies on transcription regulation and on the evolution of specific wheat tfs.

a family-level analysis of  <dig> wheat tfs showed that the myb superfamily and the erf and nac families are the three largest tf families in common wheat. these three tf families accounted for  <dig> % of the  <dig> wheat tfs analyzed. members of these families are abundant in arabidopsis, rice, and maize  <cit> . the myb superfamily is the largest group of tfs in wheat and maize  <cit> . the members of the myb superfamily have been well studied in plants. many studies have suggested that tfs in the myb superfamily play central roles in the response to abiotic stresses and in developmental processes. katiyar et al. identified  <dig> myb genes that were expressed in the seedlings of rice,  <dig> of which were differentially regulated under drought stress. a comparison of the chromosomal distribution, tandem repeats, and phylogenetic relationships of myb family genes in rice and arabidopsis revealed their evolution via duplication  <cit> . in  <dig>  zhang et al. studied  <dig> myb genes isolated from the roots, stems, leaves, anthers, and pistils of chinese spring wheat. this was the first comprehensive study of the myb family in the triticeae. the expression analysis showed that  <dig> genes were involved in the response to salinity,  <dig> genes were involved in the response to polyethylene glycol , and  <dig> genes were involved in resistance to low temperatures  <cit> . our analyses suggest that members of the myb superfamily are specifically expressed in different tissues and at different developmental stages in wheat. our results showed that, in the myb superfamily,  <dig> tissue-specific tfs were abundantly expressed in the seed , root , leaf , and flower , while fewer myb tfs were expressed in the stem  and crown  . additionally,  <dig> developmental stage-specific tfs of the myb superfamily were more abundantly expressed at the seedling , vegetative , and reproductive  stages than at the ripening , dormant seed , and germinating seed  stages .

our data also showed that the erf family, which contains  <dig> tfs, is the second largest tf family in wheat. the erf family is a subfamily of the apetala <dig> /erf family, which plays crucial roles in the ethylene signaling pathways and in a variety of developmental processes. over-expression of members of the erf family has been shown to increase plant resistance to certain pathogens and abiotic stresses. the taerf <dig> tf was identified in wheat leaves at the seedling stage. this tf was shown to be involved in the early stages of the defense response blumeria graminis via salicylic acid  signaling, and in the later stages of the defense response to fusarium graminearum and rhizoctonia cerealis via ethylene/jasmonic acid signaling pathways  <cit> . tapie1-overexpressing transgenic wheat showed significantly enhanced resistance to both r. cerealis and freezing stress, as a result of activation of defense- and stress-related genes downstream of the ethylene signaling pathway, and altered physiology  <cit> . in this study, the erf family members showed some tissue- and developmental stage-specificity. there were  <dig> tissue-specific erf sequences expressed abundantly in the flower , leaf , root , and seed , but fewer erf sequences in the stem  and crown  . these distributions are similar to those reported by zhuang et al.  <cit> . there were  <dig> developmental stage-specific tfs in the erf family that were abundantly expressed at the vegetative , seedling , and reproductive  stages, but fewer expressed at the dormant seed  and germinating seed  stages .

the third largest tf family in wheat is the nac family. in wheat, members of the nac family are involved in the defense response against the stripe rust pathogen and abiotic stresses. tanac <dig> in the nac family was shown to be induced via infection with the strip rust pathogen, methyl jasmonate, abscisic acid, ethylene, and some environmental stimuli   <cit> . in another study, the tanac <dig> transcript in leaves was induced by infection with the stripe rust pathogen and by methyl jasmonate and ethylene  <cit> . members of the nac family also show some tissue- and developmental stage-specificity. in wheat seedlings, the expression of tanac <dig> was higher in roots than in leaves and stems  <cit> . tanac <dig> was strongly expressed in developing wheat seeds, but weakly expressed in the stems and flowers  <cit> . our analyses showed that nac family members exhibit tissue- and developmental stage-specificity in wheat. in this study,  <dig> developmental stage-specific members of the nac family were most abundantly expressed at the vegetative , seedling , reproductive , and ripening  stages, while few nac family members were expressed at the dormant seed  and germinating seed  stages . also,  <dig> tissue-specific tf members of the nac family were abundantly expressed in the seed , leaf , and flower , but few nac family members were expressed in the stem  and crown  . these expression patterns are similar to those reported for tanac <dig> and tanac <dig>  understanding the biological function and distribution information of these specific tfs at the family level can provide useful information for future agricultural improvements.

CONCLUSIONS
approximately  <dig> % of the genes  in the wheat genome were identified as tfs and were clustered into  <dig> tf families. we have constructed a new wheat tf database, wheattfdb, which integrates individual tf annotations with information on domain architecture, protein features, go terms, developmental stage and tissue information, and genomic sequences. this represents an updated comprehensive database of wheat tfs, and includes genomic sequences, and information about developmental stages and tissues. based on the developmental and tissue information in wheattfdb, we identified  <dig> developmental stage-specific tfs and  <dig> tissue-specific tfs. analyses at the family level revealed that the myb superfamily and the nac and erf families are the three largest groups of wheat tfs. members of these groups were widely expressed in different tissues and at different developmental stages. these data will be useful for identifying target tfs involved in the stress response at a particular developmental stage, and will be useful for functional genomic studies on wheat tfs aimed at understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying stress responses.
