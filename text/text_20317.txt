BACKGROUND
gene expression is regulated in various ways throughout the process of mrna metabolism. in the nucleus, newly transcribed mrna precursors undergo maturation via processing steps, such as 5' end capping, splicing, 3' end cleavage and polyadenylation. after being exported to the cytoplasm, the expression of mrnas is further modulated by the regulation of their localization, stability and rate of translation.

in polarized cells, some mrnas are localized at specific sites in the cytoplasm and are translated locally, thus enabling the spatiotemporal regulation of protein expression. in neurons, for example, several mrnas that harbor localization signals, which are often detected at their 3'-untranslated regions , are selectively transported to dendrites, while most mrnas remain in the soma  <cit> . neuronal rna granules are dendritic mrna transport machines that contain ribosomes, rna-associated proteins and several translation factors, and they are transported by kif <dig> along microtubules  <cit> . during cytoplasmic transport, mrnas are considered to be translationally dormant because rna granules lack trnas and other factors required to initiate translation  <cit> .

staufen <dig> , a mammalian ortholog of the staufen protein in drosophila melanogaster, is a double-stranded rna -binding protein. stau <dig> is expressed strongly in the brain and moderately in the heart  <cit> . in neurons, stau <dig> is localized in the somatodendritic compartment and associates with rna granules  <cit> . the overexpression of stau <dig> in neurons increases the amount of poly + mrnas in dendrites  <cit> . the depletion of stau <dig> in mature hippocampal neurons by rna interference  reduces the number of dendritic spines, suggesting that stau <dig> regulates the targeting, translation and/or stabilization of the mrnas involved in spine morphogenesis  <cit> . although interactions of stau <dig> with the mrna binding proteins tap and the y14-magoh heterodimer  <cit>  have been reported, little is currently known concerning the functions of stau <dig> in mrna regulation. there are four splicing variants  of stau <dig> . among the stau <dig> isoforms, nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling proteins, stau <dig> and stau <dig> are exported from the nucleus through crm1-dependent and -independent pathways, while stau <dig> and stau <dig> use only the crm1-independent pathway . beyond that, functional differences among the isoforms are not well known.

upf <dig>  an rna helicase, was originally identified as an essential factor for nonsense- mediated mrna decay   <cit> . nmd is an mrna surveillance mechanism that degrades mrnas containing a premature termination codon to block the production of c-terminally-truncated proteins, which are potentially harmful to cells  <cit> . tethering of upf <dig> to the 3'-utr of an mrna, namely downstream of the termination codon, triggers mrna decay in hela cells  <cit> .

staufen <dig> , a paralog of stau <dig>  has been shown to induce the degradation of several mrnas, such as adp-ribosylation factor  <dig> , in hela and c2c <dig> cells  <cit> . this mrna decay mechanism resembles certain aspects of nmd  and is thus referred to as stau1-mediated mrna decay . however, whether stau <dig> also triggers smd remains unknown.

in this study, we identified upf <dig> as a stau2-interacting protein. we found that stau <dig> interacts directly with upf <dig> in an rna-independent manner. moreover, as expected from a previous report  <cit> , we found that tethering stau <dig> to the 3'-utr of an mrna has little effect on its expression in hela cells. in contrast, we found that tethering stau <dig> to the 3'-utr increases mrna and protein levels in 293f cells. intriguingly, upf <dig> is only required for the upregulation of protein expression. these data suggest that stau <dig> differentially regulates mrna fate in a context-dependent manner.

RESULTS
identification of upf <dig> as a stau2-interacting partner
to identify proteins that interact with stau <dig>  we sought cell lines in which stau <dig> was endogenously expressed and appeared to function. the expression of stau <dig> mrna in 293f and hela cells was confirmed by rt-pcr . furthermore, at least two among four splice isoforms of stau <dig>  <cit>  were detected by western blotting in both 293f and hela cell extracts, and these became undetectable upon treatment with stau2-targeting sirnas .

we established a 293f-derived cell line that stably expresses gst-fused stau <dig>  and purified stau2-containing complexes from the cell extract by gst pull-down. the 293f cell line is a variant of the hek  <dig> cell line, which can grow in freestyle  <dig> expression medium  as suspension culture at high concentration . we took advantage of the characteristics for massive culture. given that the hek  <dig> cell line has been suspected to be of a neuronal cell lineage rather than a kidney epithelial cell lineage  <cit>  and that stau <dig> has been reported to be involved in mrna regulation in neurons  <cit> , interaction counterparts in the 293f cell line were also attractive targets. we chose stau <dig> as bait from four stau <dig> isoforms. as stau <dig> is exported from the nucleus by two different pathways  <cit>  and it has an extended c-terminal domain , we expected that it might interact with a greater variety of proteins than other isoforms. stau <dig> is a component of rna granules, which are huge ribonucleoprotein  complexes containing a variety of proteins and rnas  <cit> . hence, it is likely that stau <dig> associates with a variety of proteins, some of which indirectly interact via rnas, thus making it difficult to identify direct binding partners of stau <dig>  to identify protein factors that directly bind to stau <dig> but not proteins that indirectly interact via rnas, we treated cell lysates with rnase a before purification. gst-stau2-containing complexes were then isolated from the cell extract and separated by sds-page. as shown in figure 1c, three prominent bands migrating between 150- and 100-kda were detected only in the gst-stau <dig> pull-down sample. these three bands were identified as rna helicase a , upf <dig> and mov <dig> by mass spectrometric analysis  and western blotting . these three proteins co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous stau <dig> from hela cell lysates treated with rnase a . thus, three rna helicases, rha, upf <dig> and mov <dig>  were identified as stau2-interacting partners. as rnase a primarily digests single-stranded rnas  <cit> , we cannot exclude the possibility that some structured rnas mediate the interaction between stau <dig> and these rna helicases.

stau <dig> interacts directly with upf1
upf <dig> has been reported to interact with stau <dig> to degrade a subset of mrnas  <cit> . to address whether stau <dig> has the equivalent function, we examined the interaction between stau <dig> and upf <dig>  we purified recombinant stau <dig> and upf <dig> proteins from 293f cells and examined their interaction in vitro. as shown in figure 2a, the recombinant stau <dig> and upf <dig> proteins interacted directly.

upf <dig> consists of a proline/glycine -rich region at its n-terminus followed by two zinc -finger domains, seven rna helicase motifs and a serine/glutamine -rich region at its c-terminus   <cit> . to determine which domain is involved in the interaction of upf <dig> with stau <dig>  two deletion mutants of upf <dig>  upf <dig>  and upf <dig> , were prepared . each gst-tagged upf <dig> deletion mutant was co-expressed with flag-stau <dig> in 293f cells and was pulled down from the lysates. the deletion mutant upf <dig> , but not upf <dig> , co-precipitated with stau <dig> , indicating that the n-terminal region of upf <dig>  which contains the pg-rich region and the two zn-finger domains, is sufficient for interaction with stau <dig> 

a similar method was used to identify the domain of stau <dig> that interacts with upf <dig>  combinations or individual dsrbds tagged with green fluorescent protein  were co-expressed with gst-upf <dig> in 293f cells, and their binding was tested by pull-down assays. stau <dig> deletion mutants containing either dsrbd <dig> or dsrbd <dig> co-precipitated with upf <dig> , suggesting that stau <dig> interacts with upf <dig> via dsrbd <dig> and/or dsrbd <dig>  although we cannot exclude the possibility some of the small fragments were prevented from interacting with upf <dig> by steric hindrance caused by gfp fusion.

tethering of stau <dig> to the 3'-utr of a reporter mrna enhances protein expression in 293f cells
tethering either upf <dig>  <cit>  or stau <dig>  <cit>  to a 3'-utr elicits mrna decay in hela cells, whereas stau <dig> has been reported to have little effect on the mrna level  <cit> . it has also been reported that stau <dig> and upf <dig> associate with polysomes in neurons  <cit>  and hela cells  <cit> , respectively, suggesting that they play roles in translational regulation. therefore, to address whether stau <dig> and upf <dig> cooperatively regulate gene expression, we examined whether stau <dig> and upf <dig> affect the expression of a luciferase gene when tethered to the 3'-utr of its mrna. we constructed a reporter plasmid containing a renilla luciferase  mrna with eight repeats of the ms <dig> phage coat protein binding sequence in its 3'-utr  . because both stau <dig>  <cit>  and upf <dig>  <cit>  have been reported to interact with exon-exon junction complex  components, the reporter did not contain introns to minimize the effect of ejc formation. when ms2-fused upf <dig>  stau <dig> or stau <dig> was co-expressed in hela cells with the rluc-8xms2bs reporter together with firefly luciferase , upf <dig> and stau <dig> reduced the rluc activity by approximately 50% and 30%, respectively, relative to the control . on the other hand, stau <dig> had little effect on reporter gene expression . thus, using our reporter system, we obtained results that are consistent with previously reported data in hela cells  <cit> .

we next performed the same tethering assays using adherent culture of 293f cells. unexpectedly, we found that expressing either ms2-stau <dig> or ms2-stau <dig> enhanced the expression of the reporter gene by approximately 60% or 70%, respectively, relative to the control . these results indicate that tethering stau <dig> to the 3'-utr of a reporter mrna enhances protein expression in 293f cells, but not in hela cells, suggesting that stau <dig> differentially regulates gene expression in a cell type-specific manner. interestingly, the direct tethering of ms2-upf <dig> had little effect on reporter expression in 293f cells . this may indicate that the ability of upf <dig> to trigger mrna decay is attenuated in 293f cells.

stau <dig> tethered to the 3'-utr of an mrna enhances protein expression in a upf1-dependent manner in 293f cells
we next investigated whether the enhancement of protein expression by stau <dig> observed in 293f cells is dependent on upf <dig>  we depleted upf <dig> from 293f cells by rnai and examined the effect of stau <dig> tethered to the 3'-utr of rluc-8xms2bs. stau <dig> failed to enhance the expression of the reporter gene in upf1-depleted 293f cells . upf <dig> depletion using another sirna also diminished the ability of stau <dig> to enhance reporter gene expression . depletion of rha, another rna helicase that we identified as a stau2-interacting partner , did not affect the ability of stau <dig> to enhance reporter gene expression . these results indicate that stau <dig> enhances protein expression by binding to the 3'-utr of mrnas in a upf1-dependent manner.

stau <dig> tethered to the 3'-utr increases mrna levels independently of upf <dig> in 293f cells
to determine whether the enhancement of protein expression by stau <dig> is due to facilitated translation or an increase in mrna stability, we examined the steady-state level of a reporter mrna in the presence or absence of ms2-fusion proteins. we first examined mrna expression using the rluc-8xms2bs reporter. however, we were not able to detect clear single bands suitable for quantitative determination , as is often observed in transient expression experiments. to stabilize the expression of reporter mrna and enable precise quantification, we established a 293f-derived cell line stably expressing a reporter mrna encoding gfp with 8xms2bs in its 3'-utr  . this reporter system is not suitable for monitoring changes in protein levels because gfp has a long half-life  in mammalian cells  <cit> . nevertheless, we detected moderate increases in the level of gfp in 293f-gfp-8xms2bs cells in which ms2-stau <dig> had been expressed for  <dig> h by western blot analysis  and fluorescence microscopy , supporting the results of the ms2-tethering assay using the rluc-8xms2bs reporter. next, we expressed ms2-fused upf <dig>  stau <dig> or stau <dig> in 293f-gfp-8xms2bs cells and quantitated the reporter mrna by northern blot analysis . both stau <dig> and stau <dig> increased the steady-state level of the reporter mrna by approximately three-fold relative to the control, whereas upf <dig> had little effect . this result indicates that stau <dig> and stau <dig> stabilize mrna by binding to the 3'-utr in 293f cells.

we next examined whether upf <dig> is required for stau2-mediated mrna stabilization. stau <dig> tethered to the 3'-utr moderately increased the gfp protein level in control sirna-treated cells, but not in upf1-depleted cells , supporting the results of the ms2-tethering assay using the rluc-8xms2bs reporter. therefore, we then examined whether upf <dig> is required for stau2-mediated mrna stabilization using this system. stau <dig> tethered to the 3'-utr stabilized the mrna in upf1-depleted cells and in control sirna-treated cells , indicating that when bound to a 3'-utr, stau <dig> can stabilize an mrna independently of upf <dig> in 293f cells.

discussion
in this study, we identified upf <dig> as a stau2-interacting partner by affinity chromatography . stau <dig> was found to interact directly with upf <dig> in an rna-independent manner through its dsrbd <dig> and dsrbd <dig> domains . it has been shown that in vitro, dsrbd <dig> has strong dsrna-binding activity, whereas dsrbd <dig> does not interact with dsrna  <cit> . although the possibility that the affinity between stau <dig> and upf <dig> might be regulated through the binding of dsrna to dsrbd <dig> cannot be excluded, stau <dig> can interact with upf <dig> even in the absence of dsrna. the dsrbd <dig> and dsrbd <dig> domains are conserved among all four stau <dig> isoforms , it is less likely that interaction with upf <dig> is specific to stau <dig>  which we used in this study. given that a shorter isoform, probably stau <dig>  is most abundantly expressed in 293f cells , we assume that stau <dig> is also involved in upf1-dependent mrna regulation in 293f cells. stau <dig>  a paralog of stau <dig>  has been reported to interact with upf <dig> via a different domain that resides within dsrbd <dig> and the tubulin-binding domain  <cit> . however, our results , together with a previous report  <cit> , indicate that upf <dig> uses the same domain  to interact with both stau <dig> and stau <dig>  different binding modes of stau <dig> and stau <dig> to upf <dig> might be responsible for the different results they produced in hela cells .

it has been shown that stau <dig> mediates mrna decay by recruiting upf <dig> to target mrnas  <cit> , although the target protein levels have not been examined. we found that tethering stau <dig> to the 3'-utr of a reporter mrna has little effect on its protein level in hela cells , consistent with the results reported by monshausen et al. showing that stau <dig> does not efficiently degrade mrnas when tethered to their 3'-utr in hela cells  <cit> . thus, although we do not yet know why, stau <dig> is not likely to trigger mrna decay in hela cells, or at least it does so less efficiently than stau <dig>  the results from our immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that stau <dig> interacts with upf <dig> in hela cells . therefore, a possible explanation for these different effects is that the different domains that stau <dig> and stau <dig> use to interact with upf <dig> might differentially regulate its activity.

in contrast to the data obtained in hela cells, we found that tethering stau <dig> to the 3'-utr of a target mrna increased the target's mrna  and protein  levels in 293f cells. stau <dig> was able to stabilize mrna, even in the upf1-depleted condition . although we do not yet know the mechanism underlying this mrna stabilization, stau <dig> may recruit mrna-associated proteins that protect the mrna from degradation. maher-laporte et al. isolated stau2-containing ribosome-free rnps from the embryonic rat brain and identified poly -binding protein cytoplasmic  <dig>  and y box-binding protein  <dig>  in the particles  <cit> . both pabpc <dig>  <cit>  and yb <dig>  <cit>  have been reported to be able to stabilize mrna. possibly, in 293f cells and in neurons, stau2-bound mrnas are stabilized in rnps containing pabpc <dig> and yb <dig> during transport or until the time when the translation products are required.

in contrast to mrna stabilization mediated by stau <dig>  its enhancement of protein expression is dependent on upf <dig> in 293f cells . this suggests that mrnas stabilized by stau <dig> are translationally dormant and that stau <dig> can upregulate protein expression at the translational level in a upf1-dependent manner, possibly via the recruitment of upf <dig> to target mrnas. as far as we know, this is the second report indicating that upf <dig> functions positively in gene expression. ajamian et al. showed that overexpressing upf <dig> enhances, whereas depleting upf <dig> reduces, hiv- <dig> expression at the rna and protein levels in hela cells. this enhancement requires the atpase activity of upf <dig> but not its ability to interact with upf <dig>  <cit> . it would be interesting to examine whether the atpase activity of upf <dig> is required for the upregulation of protein synthesis by the stau2-upf <dig> complex in 293f cells.

the results of our tethering assays indicate that stau <dig>  stau <dig> and upf <dig> regulate mrna differently in hela and 293f cells . smd, which has been reported to function in hela  <cit>  and c2c <dig>  <cit>  cells, is unlikely to operate in 293f cells. although we do not yet know what causes this difference among cell types, this difference in smd function is attributable, at least in part, to differences in the activity of upf <dig> because upf <dig> does not trigger mrna decay in 293f cells when directly tethered to the 3'-utr . the atpase activity of upf <dig> is required for it to trigger mrna decay  <cit> . a recent structural study by chakrabarti et al. showed that binding to upf <dig> induces a conformational change in upf <dig> that turns on its atpase activity  <cit> . the phosphorylation of upf <dig> is also required for nmd  <cit> , although its effects on upf1's atpase activity are still unknown. in addition, the efficiency of nmd has been reported to vary among different yeast strains  <cit> , mammalian tissues  <cit>  and even among different single cell-derived cell lines  <cit> . to test the possibility that the activity of upf <dig> is differentially regulated in different cell lines, it would be tempting to look for differences in the association between upf <dig> and upf <dig> and in the phosphorylation of upf <dig> in hela versus 293f cells.

in addition to upf <dig>  we identified two rna helicases, rha and mov <dig>  as stau2-interacting partners , both of which are reportedly involved in translational regulation  <cit> . interestingly, rha was identified as a component of stau1-containing rnps in 293t cells  <cit> , suggesting that rha is a common interacting partner of stau <dig> and stau <dig>  given that rha facilitates the translation of several mrnas such as jund mrna thorough the structured post-transcriptional control element at their 5'-utr  <cit> , it would be interesting to examine the effects of tethering of stau <dig> or stau <dig> to a structured 5'-utr on the mrna translation.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we examined the roles of stau <dig> in mrna regulation using artificial reporter systems. our findings indicate that stau <dig>  when bound to a 3'-utr, enhances mrna translation and stabilizes the mrna through upf1-dependent and -independent mechanisms respectively in a cell-type specific manner. as far as we know, mrnas that bind directly to stau <dig> have not yet been identified. to understand mrna regulation by stau <dig> in more detail and to elucidate its physiological roles, mrnas that are recognized specifically by stau <dig> should be identified in future studies.
