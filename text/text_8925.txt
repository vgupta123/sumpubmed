BACKGROUND
retinitis pigmentosa  is the leading cause of inherited blindness. in recent years, progress has been made in the identification of genetic defects and molecular mechanisms that underlie rp  <cit> . the rd <dig> mouse is among the best-characterized animal models of rp  <cit> . it is distinguished by early onset and rapid degeneration of rod photoreceptors with cell death beginning around postnatal day  <dig> , during the period of photoreceptor differentiation, and completed by p <dig>  <cit> . cone cell degeneration occurs slowly over the following year  <cit> . the rd <dig> mutation is autosomal recessive, occurring in the β-subunit of the rod-specific cgmp phosphodiesterase <dig>  gene  <cit> . the defect in pde <dig> causes a failure in the hydrolysis of cgmp, resulting in a doubling of cytoplasmic cgmp levels by p <dig> in rd <dig> whole retina compared to wild type  and a nearly 10-fold increase by p <dig>  <cit> .

cgmp is an important second messenger involved in regulation of many functions including phototransduction as well as neuronal differentiation, smooth muscle contractility, and olfactory stimulation  <cit> . in the outer segment of a mature normal photoreceptor, cgmp facilitates the opening of ion channels permeable to sodium leading to depolarization of the cell. these channels are also permeable to calcium, which may play several roles including negative feedback of cgmp. in the rd <dig> retina, photoreceptors degenerate just as the outer segment begins to form. although the significance of cgmp in phototransduction is well established, little is known about the role of cgmp in developing photoreceptors or how it leads to degeneration in the rd <dig> retina.

we have used microarray analysis to investigate differences in gene expression between the rd <dig> and wt mouse retinas during the period preceding cell death from p <dig>  prior to any identified morphological or biochemical differences, through p <dig>  when early degenerative changes are present but prior to onset of cell death. during this period,  <dig> differentially expressed genes were identified. we confirmed two genes to be differentially expressed at all  <dig> time points: the mutant gene, pde6b, and rab acceptor  <dig>  . rabac <dig> codes for an integral membrane protein, pra <dig>  that interacts with numerous small prenylated gtpases in the rab family  <cit> , consistent with a role in vesicular trafficking. the specific function of pra <dig> in photoreceptors, however, has not been elucidated.

here we present the first description of pra <dig> in the retina, establishing the localization of pra <dig> protein in developing wt and rd <dig> mouse retinas. we demonstrate that its expression in photoreceptors is significantly decreased and mislocalized in rd <dig> retina compared to wt, prior to rod photoreceptor degeneration and consistent with a role of pra <dig> in rod differentiation.

RESULTS
identification of differentially expressed genes
gene expression profiles of rd <dig> mouse retina were compared to those of wt retina at four time points: p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig>  this time span was selected such that the earliest time point precedes any reported morphological or biochemical changes in rd <dig> retina compared to wt and the latest time point precedes onset of cell death. at least four samples were examined for microarray analysis at each time point. genes that showed  <dig>  fold or greater change, with false discovery rate confidence interval  p-values less than  <dig> were included, resulting in the identification of  <dig> differentially expressed genes in rd <dig> compared to wt retina between p <dig> and p <dig> . of these genes,  <dig> were downregulated and  <dig> were upregulated at one or more time points. only  <dig> genes, all in the crystallin family, were included in both groups. these  <dig> genes were upregulated at p <dig> but downregulated at p <dig>  and in one case also at p <dig> 

characterization of functional groups
functional groups of differentially expressed genes were derived from gene ontology  terms . analysis identified approximately two-thirds of the differentially expressed genes to be associated with only six functional categories: cell cycle, development , metabolism, signal transduction, transcription, and transport. consistent with the timing of retinal degeneration in the rd <dig> mouse, only  <dig> genes associated with apoptosis were differentially expressed at early developmental ages, whereas most genes associated with visual transduction were differentially expressed only at the later time points, p <dig> or p <dig> 

functional analysis shows differences in genes identified at p <dig> compared to p <dig> . at p <dig>  forty-five genes were downregulated, of which 24% were associated with metabolism, 18% with transport, and 9% each with transcription, development, and signal transduction . all differentially expressed genes at p <dig> were down regulated. forty-two genes were differentially expressed at p <dig>  three-quarters of which were downregulated . of the genes downregulated at p <dig>  26% were associated with transport, 13% with signal transduction, and 10% with metabolism. genes associated with cell adhesion and visual perception, not seen at p <dig>  comprise another 13% and 10% of downregulated genes, respectively. fewer genes associated with transcription and development were identified at p <dig> compared to p <dig>  more than half of the upregulated genes were members of the crystallin family that were not observed at p <dig>  consistent with previous studies demonstrating upregulation of retinal crystallins in the degenerating rd <dig> retina  <cit> .

quantitative analysis of differentially expressed genes
quantitative real-time pcr  was used to validate microarray results for  <dig> genes at one or more time points . nearly all of the tested genes that were identified as differentially expressed in the microarray were confirmed by qpcr. however, some genes not detected in the microarray results were found to be differentially expressed at additional time points, consistent with the greater sensitivity of this technique. of the genes that were analyzed, only two genes were significantly downregulated at all developmental time points examined: the rd <dig> mutant gene, pde6b,  and rabac <dig> . rabac <dig> was downregulated by a factor of 2– <dig> fold at all four time points. its protein product, pra <dig>  was clearly observed in wt retina at p <dig> and p <dig> by western blot analysis , but was greatly reduced in rd <dig> retinas at p <dig> and p <dig> . pra <dig> has not previously been investigated in the retina and was selected for further studies.

localization of pra <dig> in developing wt and rd <dig> retinas
we used an immunohistochemical approach to determine the localization of pra <dig> protein in wt and rd <dig> mouse retinal tissue at four time points during development: p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig>  at all ages examined, no pra1-like immunoreactivity  was observed when the primary antibody was omitted . pra1-lir was localized to the perinuclear region, associated with the golgi apparatus, of most inner retinal neurons in all ages of the wt retina. at p <dig>  this was most apparent in the ganglion cell layer , with staining progressively more intense in the nuclear layers at p <dig> and p <dig>  punctate labeling was also seen throughout both plexiform layers .

in the outer retina at p <dig>  the wt retina appeared to have brighter and more defined pra1-lir in developing inner segments compared to a fainter and more diffuse pattern in the rd <dig> inner segments . a noticeable streaking pattern of pra1-lir through the distal portion of the outer nuclear layer  to the region of the developing is was also seen, which correlates with the timing of growth and differentiation of the photoreceptor apical processes. this streaking pattern was much more defined in the wt compared to rd <dig> retina and, at higher magnification, appeared to be a chain of small vesicle-like punctae . no differences in pra1-lir were seen in the inner retinal layers of wt compared to rd <dig> retinas.

at p <dig>  in both wt and rd <dig> retinas, pra <dig> staining appeared more intense compared to corresponding tissue at p <dig>  overall at p <dig>  the rd <dig> retina appeared to have fainter pra1-lir compared to wt tissue . pra1-lir appeared more intense in the proximal half of the is layer of wt retina with more diffuse pra1-lir in the distal is . no comparable distinction was seen in the rd <dig> retina with large pra1-lir punctae distributed diffusely throughout the is region . as observed at p <dig>  the streaking pattern of pra1-lir through the onl to the is region was present, but to a greater degree in p <dig> retina. in the p <dig> wt retina, the streaks appeared longer and more defined  while in the streaks in the rd <dig> retina appeared shorter in length and less intense . the inner retina of both wt and rd <dig> tissue appeared to have the same general pattern of pra1-lir with intense staining in the perinuclear space of ganglion cells and some inl cells as well as punctate staining throughout the inl. pra1-lir punctae were seen throughout the outer plexiform layer  and more diffusely in the inner plexiform layer .

pra1-lir in p <dig> tissue appeared similar to that at p <dig>  with a few notable differences . as above, p <dig> wt tissue was overall brighter in appearance when compared to the rd <dig> age-matched tissue. intense pra1-lir could be observed in the proximal half of the is layer with more diffuse label extending throughout the distal portion of the is layer . the intense pra1-lir observed in the proximal half of the wt is layer was absent in the rd <dig> is layer. instead, only diffuse pra1-lir was observed in the is layer of rd <dig> mouse retina . the p <dig> wt retina, like the p <dig> wt retina, had a clearly delineated streaking pattern of pra1-lir from the onl to the is margin. in contrast, the pra1-lir streaking pattern was less intense in p <dig> rd <dig> retina compared to age-matched wt retina, although it was more distinct compared to p <dig> rd <dig> retinas. by p <dig>  pra1-lir in the inl was concentrated at the perinuclear region of most cells with punctate staining still apparent in the opl. no difference was seen between wt and rd <dig> in the inner retina.

in p <dig> wt retina, intense pra1-lir was observed at the proximal margin of the is layer, where photoreceptor golgi membranes reside, with moderately intense pra1-lir in the distal is layer. the os layer appeared to include sparse pra1-lir with little staining in the opl compared to p <dig> retinas . the streak-like pattern seen in the onl at younger ages was not present in the mature p <dig> retina. the pattern of pra1-lir in the inner retina appeared similar to p <dig>  perinuclear staining was apparent in most inl cells. pra1-lir showed a similar pattern of staining in the surviving inner retina of age-matched rd <dig> littermates at p <dig>  however, the ganglion cell layer  of rd <dig> retina at p <dig> appeared to have less intense pra1-lir in the perinuclear region compared to wt . in addition to perinuclear staining still present in the inl of the rd <dig> retina, pra1-lir was present in processes throughout the inl. diffuse punctae were also seen throughout the ipl. the residual onl, containing cone cell nuclei, had little pra1-lir, while the area distal to the remaining onl had a few areas of bright punctae exhibiting pra1-lir in the region of residual cone is.

relationship of pra1-lir to golgi and cilia
because golgi apparatus is localized to the proximal is of photoreceptors and is disrupted during rd <dig> photoreceptor differentiation  <cit> , we double labeled p <dig> retinas with pra <dig> and the cis-golgi marker, gm- <dig>  no crossreactivity was seen between the antibodies, although nonspecific labeling of blood vessels was observed with mouse monoclonal gm- <dig> staining . in wt retinas, gm-130-lir intensely labeled the developing inner segment at the border of the onl . pra1-lir colocalized with gm-130-lir at the is margin, although the golgi marker was more extensive. in contrast, no overlap was seen in the distal portion of the is where pra1-lir was distributed diffusely. the punctate streak-like pattern that was observed with pra1-lir in the onl appeared as a continuous line labeled with both markers: some segments single labeled with each marker and some double labeled segments. this streak-like pattern is consistent with the migration of golgi from the perinuclear region to the is during photoreceptor differentiation. in the inner retina, intense gm- <dig> staining was localized in the perinuclear region of most cells and, in a few cases, in processes within the inl. most pra1-lir overlapped with the golgi marker, although some pra1-lir fine processes and punctae in both plexiform layers and diffuse label within somata at the outer margin of the inl were negative for gm-130-lir. conversely, gm-130-lir appeared more extensive than pra <dig> staining in the perinuclear region of many cells. the overall pattern of gm-130-lir was similar in double labeled p <dig> rd <dig> retinas except in the is region . gm-130-lir was distributed more extensively with both single and double labeled punctae in the distal portion of the rd <dig> is , which was never seen in the wt.


pra <dig> has been shown to interact with rab <dig>  <cit> , which is also associated with golgi and post-golgi trafficking of rhodopsin  <cit> . because available antibodies to pra <dig> and rab <dig> were raised in the same species, cross-reactivity prevented colocalization using immunohistochemical techniques. however, double labeling of rab6-lir with gm-130-lir at p <dig> showed close apposition of the two markers with minimal overlap in either wt or rd <dig> photoreceptors , as might be expected from their predicted localization to trans- and cis-golgi, respectively  <cit> . rab6-lir had a punctate appearance, consistent with a vesicular pattern. similar to gm-130-lir, rab6-lir was limited to the inner portion of the is in the wt retina, but extended apically through the entire is in the rd <dig> retina.

in order to determine whether pra <dig> localization extends through the photoreceptor cilia, p <dig> wt retinas were double labeled with antibodies against pra <dig> and rp <dig>  a microtubule associated protein present in the os portion of the photoreceptor axoneme  <cit> . pra1-lir punctae were often observed in close apposition to rp1-lir , with little or no rp1-lir colocalization. sparse pra <dig> punctae were seen, however, in the os beyond rp1-lir . no label was detected in control experiments omitting primary antibodies .

quantitative analysis of pra1-lir
at all time points, pra1-lir appeared more intense in the wt outer retina than in the rd <dig> retina. in order to confirm this observation, we performed quantitative analysis using image j software to determine the average intensity of the is layer for littermate pairs of wt and rd <dig> tissue. for all developmental time points examined, the average pra1-lir intensity of the is layer in wt tissue increased with age and was greater than that of the age-matched rd <dig> is layer intensity . less pra1-lir was observed in the is layer of rd <dig> retinas when compared to littermate wt retinas at all ages, although variability precluded significance at p <dig>  to determine whether differential expression of pra <dig> was limited to the outer retina, we also looked at the average intensity of pra1-lir in the inner plexiform layer  at each developmental time point. in this analysis we found that the average intensity of pra1-lir was very similar in wt and rd <dig> retinas with some difference seen only at p <dig> .

discussion
the rd <dig> mouse is a model of retinal degeneration
the rd <dig> mouse retina has been of interest as a model of inherited retinal degenerative diseases since it was first identified in  <dig>  <cit> . the initial molecular trigger in the rd <dig> retina, defective pde6β leading to increased cgmp, is well understood  <cit> . the final events that underlie cell death have been the target of many investigations . a virtual black box obscures the molecular processes that link these two events. in order to investigate the earliest events that are downstream of the pde6b mutation in rd <dig> photoreceptors, we selected time points starting at p <dig>  which is more than a week after pde6b gene expression but prior to any identified biochemical or morphological differences, and concluding at p <dig>  prior to the initiation of photoreceptor cell death.

previous studies in rd <dig> whole retina during this time window have shown that the cytoplasmic cgmp level is twice the wt level by p <dig> with an increase of nearly 10-fold by p <dig>  <cit> . electron microscopical studies  <cit>  have identified abnormal pathology in the rd <dig> retina, including retardation of is growth as early as p <dig>  <cit> , golgi disruption by p <dig>  and formation of widespread scattered vacuole-like structures by p <dig>  <cit> . the mitochondrial matrix begins to disintegrate in photoreceptor is by p6- <dig>  in some cases prior to the appearance of outer segment disks  <cit> . at the rod ribbon synapse, a normal dyad configuration is formed with horizontal cells at p <dig>  but the triad configuration incorporating a bipolar process seen in the wt retina at p <dig> fails to form in the rd <dig> retina  <cit> .

our microarray analysis of differentially expressed genes during this early time frame identified only  <dig> of  <dig> genes associated with apoptosis, consistent with our effort to target the earliest molecular changes that may provide the initial trigger for degeneration. several studies using microarray analysis of rd <dig> retina at later time points, focusing on initiation of cell death, have been previously reported  <cit> . using cluster analysis to investigate temporal patterns in groups of genes, rohrer and colleagues identified differential expression beginning by p <dig>  <cit> . hackam, et al. identified temporally distinct pathways by comparing peak rod degeneration at p <dig> to early  and later  cone degeneration  <cit> . genes involved in transport mechanisms and signaling pathways were differentially expressed at p <dig> as well as in our study at earlier time points.

the link between the mutant gene and rd <dig> pathology remains poorly understood
cgmp regulates the cgmp-gated  ion channel in the mature retina, which regulates ca2+ and na+ entry in response to light. efforts to measure ca2+ in the degenerating rd <dig> retina have provided support for the hypothesis that the loss of function of pde6β induces apoptosis as a result of high levels of ca2+ influx through the cng ion channel  <cit> . this hypothesis is further supported by experiments in which loss of functional cng channels slows the degeneration in pde6b mutants  <cit> .

several observations raise the question as to whether pde6β may play an unexplored role in photoreceptor development, independent of its role in phototransduction in the mature retina, and whether such a role could contribute to the initiation of cell death. first, pde6b is expressed at embryonic day  <dig>  in the mouse retina, much earlier than other genes involved in phototransduction, such as rhodopsin expression that becomes apparent at p <dig>  pde6b is even expressed prior to nrl, a transcription factor that activates expression of rod-specific genes and is expressed at p <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, pde6a and pde6g are first expressed more than a week after pde6b at p <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that any possible role that pde6β might play during embryonic development may be through an atypical structural conformation. other members of the pde family, including the cone pde6α’, function as homodimers. the inhibitory gamma subunits are unique to the pde <dig> subfamily. further research is needed to explore the possibility that pde6β could play a functional role during early photoreceptor development, possibly by forming a homodimer.

secondly, the doubling of cgmp levels in whole rd <dig> retina by p <dig>  <cit>  indicates that pde6β is functional in wt retina prior to this age, a time at which expression of rhodopsin and other genes associated with phototransduction is first initiated  <cit> . in addition, pathological changes described above can be observed prior to outer segment differentiation and prior to expression of genes required for assembly of the phototransduction machinery. finally, although best known in the retina for its role in phototransduction, cgmp is an important signaling molecule throughout the cns. it functions in signaling pathways involved in neuronal differentiation and gene expression, modulation of neurotransmitter release, learning and memory, brain seizure activity, and neurotoxicity  <cit> . cgmp is known to act on three signaling pathways: cgmp-gated ion channels, inhibitory feedback onto pde, and activation of phosphokinase g . increased phosphorylation of pkg substrates has been observed in the rd <dig> retina compared to the wt retina at p <dig>  consistent with multiple signaling roles for cgmp in the retina  <cit> . although specific substrates for pkg have not been clearly identified in photoreceptors  <cit> , signaling through pkg is known to regulate gene transcription  <cit> .

together, these observations support the hypothesis that pde6β plays a role in regulation of cgmp signaling during pre- and/or early postnatal photoreceptor differentiation that is independent of its role in phototransduction in the mature outer segment. our analysis of functional groups of the differentially regulated genes supports this hypothesis. first, only  <dig> of the differentially expressed genes, excluding the mutant gene, were associated with visual transduction, and most of these were only expressed at the later time points. secondly, the differentially expressed genes are predominantly in functional groups that are consistent with a role in development and differentiation, including development, transport, cell cycle, signal transduction, transcription, and metabolism. transport is particularly important during photoreceptor differentiation as the cell must transport membranes and proteins in order to elongate both its axon and inner segment, followed by assembly of the outer segment. within this category, we identified rabac <dig>  which was of particular interest as the only gene in the dataset other than the mutant pde6b gene, identified as downregulated at all four time points examined.

pra <dig> is important for vesicular trafficking
pra <dig>  the protein product of rabac <dig>  is comprised of  <dig> amino acids and an estimated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda  <cit> . structural studies have identified two integral membrane domains  <cit> , although fractionation studies have localized pra <dig> to both the cytoplasm and the golgi complex  <cit> . pra <dig> interacts with numerous small gtpases, all of which are prenylated  <cit>  and has been proposed to play a role in vesicular trafficking.

martincic et al.  <cit>  hypothesized that pra <dig> might function in vesicular docking and fusion based on its initial binding partners, rab3a and vamp <dig>  since this initial study five specific hypotheses have been proposed. the observation that pra <dig> binds to prenylated gtpases and occurs as a cytoplasmic protein suggested that pra <dig> might act as an escort protein, transporting prenylated gtpases through the cell by masking the prenyl moiety  <cit> . secondly, pra <dig> may function as a golgi sorting protein by facilitating the insertion of small gtpases into the membranes of transport vesicles and instructing them where to go in the cell  <cit> . sivars and colleagues  <cit>  proposed a third function of pra <dig> as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor  displacement factor  that aids in recycling rabs during vesicular trafficking. an additional role for pra <dig> in lipid transport, modulation of lipid homeostasis, and cell migration has been proposed based on proteomic analysis of pra <dig> depleted nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells  <cit>  and further supported by studies implicating pra <dig> in the fusion of transport vesicles with the plasma membrane  <cit> . finally, evidence supports a role for pra <dig> in transport and assembly of viral proteins, although in some cases it may play an inhibitory role  <cit> . these proposed functions for pra <dig> are in no way mutually exclusive and in many cases are overlapping.

pra <dig> is significantly downregulated during early photoreceptor differentiation in the rd <dig> retina
we present here the first report describing the expression and localization of pra <dig> protein in the developing and mature wt and rd <dig> mouse retinas. in the developing wt retina, colocalization with gm-130-lir indicates that pra <dig> is localized to the photoreceptor golgi apparatus as it translocates from the perikarya to the proximal is during photoreceptor differentiation. pra <dig> is also inferred to be in proximity with rab <dig> during photoreceptor differentiation. diffuse pra1-lir that does not colocalize with the golgi marker is seen in the distal is of wt photoreceptors starting at p <dig>  in the mature retina, pra <dig> positive punctae extend up to, but not overlapping with, the proximal end of the os axoneme as labeled by rp1-lir. only very sparse punctae are seen in the os. both plexiform layers also contain pra <dig> positive punctae independent of gm- <dig> staining during postnatal retinal development. in the wt opl, pra1-lir appears less intense at p <dig>  suggesting that it may play a role in neurite outgrowth and/or synapse formation that is not required for maintenance in the adult. this observation is of particular interest in light of the failure of the rd <dig> rod photoreceptors to form a triad synapse with bipolar dendrites  <cit> . together, these observations are consistent with a role for pra <dig> in vesicular and lipid trafficking from the golgi to vesicles directed both toward the cilia and the synapse. pra1-lir also colocalizes with the golgi marker in the perinuclear region of most cells in the gcl and the inl.

by both western blot at p2-p <dig> and immunohistochemistry at p6-p <dig>  pra <dig> expression appears less intense in rd <dig> compared to age-matched, wt retinas. mislocalization of pra1-lir in the is layer is seen in the rd <dig> retina at all ages examined. compared to wt, rd <dig> retinas display a less intense, diffuse pattern of staining in the is with some large punctae distributed throughout. colocalization of pra1- and gm-130-lir is seen in some, but not all, of these is punctae. this observation is consistent with em pathology in the rd <dig> retina showing defects characteristic of vesicular trafficking  <cit> .

in developing mouse retina, the decrease in pra1-lir in the rd <dig> is layer compared to wt is apparent at all ages examined, and is statistically different by p <dig>  staining in the residual rd <dig> outer retina at p <dig> suggests that pra1-lir is also present in cone photoreceptors. the pra1-lir intensity in the perinuclear region of the rd <dig> gcl is also reduced at p <dig>  consistent with a possible role of pra <dig> in neurite remodeling and sprouting. virtually all of the proteins altered in pra1-depleted nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells that are linked to changes in cell migration  <cit>  are also known to be important in neurite outgrowth. in the inner retina we found similar average intensities of pra1-lir at all time points examined except at p <dig>  most likely an anomalous result due to small sample size. this suggests that the 2– <dig> fold reduction in rabac <dig> mrna measured by qpcr in whole retina is largely due to loss of expression in photoreceptors, with less overall change in protein expression in the inner retina.

pra <dig> may play a role in vesicular trafficking during photoreceptor differentiation
rod photoreceptors are highly specialized cells that exhibit unambiguous cellular polarity. polarity of these cells is established during cell differentiation and maintained by the sorting of lipid membranes and proteins to their appropriate targets through a process of vesicular trafficking. using xenopus as a model system, four members of the rab gtpase family, rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig>  and rab <dig>  have been identified in vesicular trafficking of rhodopsin from the golgi to the connecting cilium at the base of the outer segments  <cit> . two of these, rab <dig> and rab <dig>  bind directly to pra <dig> in yeast two hybrid screens  <cit> . rab proteins have also been highlighted in proteomics analyses of the bovine rod outer segment  <cit>  and of the mouse photoreceptor sensory cilium complex  <cit> . these studies have focused on maintenance of the mature photoreceptor cell. whether the same rabs play a role in vesicular sorting during photoreceptor development has not yet been explored.

defects in vesicular trafficking have been implicated in retinal degenerative diseases. mutation in rab escort protein  <dig>  a protein responsible for modifying small gtpases, has been linked to choroideremia, a disease characterized by degeneration of the choroid followed by photoreceptor degeneration  <cit> . defects in rab <dig> trafficking have been documented in bardet-biedl syndrome, a cilliopathy characterized by developmental defects including degeneration of the photoreceptors  <cit> . the association between vesicular trafficking defects and retinal degenerative disease is consistent with the early pathology observed in the rd <dig> mouse. pra <dig> has been proposed to regulate the recruitment of rab effector proteins as well as proteins involved in proper tethering and fusion of vesicles to their target membrane, such as vamp <dig>  <cit> . a defect in recruitment by pra <dig> of rab effectors and proteins involved in the downstream events of vesicular trafficking could correlate to the defects in vesicular trafficking reported in rd <dig> retinas  <cit> .

alternatively, figueroa and colleagues  <cit>  have proposed that pra <dig> could act as a chaperone protein to shuttle small gtpases through cells to their target locations. pra <dig> was found to bind to other small prenylated gtpases besides rabs, including rhoa, a small gtpase involved in actin remodeling, and k-ras and h-ras, small gtpases involved in cell growth, differentiation, and survival  <cit> . for k-ras, the rate of dissociation from the plasma membrane has been shown to be reduced or enhanced by knockdown or overexpression of pra <dig>  respectively  <cit> . as with defects in vesicular trafficking, a defect in shuttling small gtpases required for differentiation throughout photoreceptors could correlate to the early pathology observed in the rd <dig> mouse retina.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that pde6β may have a function during photoreceptor development distinct from its phototransduction role in mature os. our data demonstrate a significant downregulation in rabac <dig> gene expression and in pra <dig> protein expression by p <dig> in the rd <dig> retina. these data support the hypothesis that pra <dig> plays an important role in organization of the golgi and vesicular trafficking during the early stages of rod photoreceptor cell differentiation and suggest that the decrease in pra <dig> expression in the rd <dig> retina may serve as a link coupling the genetic mutation in pde6b to the very early defects in membrane trafficking and the delay in rod photoreceptor cell differentiation that are subsequently followed by cell death. the interaction of pde6β and cgmp signaling pathways with pra <dig> is an important area for future investigation.
