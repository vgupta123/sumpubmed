BACKGROUND
increasingly, experiments in many areas of biological research simultaneously record activity changes in hundreds or even thousands of variables  over a time window t  <cit> . due to both internal and external noise, the recorded activity is stochastic. traditionally all collected data variables are subjected to statistical analysis although, in most cases, not all of them change in response to applied stimuli  <cit> . including large numbers of non-responsive variables in the analysis can simply bury the true information carried by a small number of responsive ones leading to the erroneous conclusion that no changes have occurred. in other words, due to the current technology development in biology we often face too much rather than too little data and paradoxically this may sometimes actually impose constraints which prevent us from detecting important information patterns contained within it  <cit> . in this way important information can be lost. it is therefore of crucial importance to find a way of first filtering out non-responsive variables before performing any further statistical analysis  <cit> .

in  <cit>  we have already proposed a way to handle this problem. manova  <cit>  is applied to analyze data collected from multi-electrode array electrophysiological recordings of activity changes in ensembles of  <dig> or more different neurons. to assess whether there are significant changes in activity during exposure to a defined sensory stimulus, it is proposed that we have to look at the significance score  of each subset of all of them. intuitively, it is argued in  <cit>  that the highest value of the significance score corresponds to the area where changes occur. it can readily be seen that this approach could be easily generalized to other types of multivariate biological data such as from gene microarrays or from brain imaging experiments where application of conventional statistical approaches may seriously limit identification of important significant changes. it could also play an important role in the development of systems biology approaches to modeling and understanding complex functional units of biological activity.

however, despite the fact that the approach is interesting and promising, all results presented in  <cit>  are numerical and lacking a rigorous theoretical treatment. on the other hand, the algorithm proposed in  <cit>  is actually an np hard problem: it requires calculation of the significance score for every subset of the recorded area  and therefore involves considerable computing power for large data sets which makes analysis difficult and time-consuming, if not impossible. in the current paper our primary purpose is to address the following issues:

 <dig>  does the area  containing the highest values of significance scores correspond to that where actual changes occur?

 <dig>  does the significance score vanish when more and more non-responsive units are included in the analysis?

 <dig>  can we avoid calculating the significance score of all subsets, i.e. solve the np hard problem?

 <dig>  can the solution to the problem offer more effective analysis of complex biological multivariate data sets?

we first address these issues in a theoretically treatable model. in general, the set with the highest significance score does not coincide with, but is a subset of, the changed area. however, a single variable exhibits different properties dependent upon whether it belongs to the changed area or not. based upon this difference in properties exhibited by variables we propose the application of an easily implemented algorithm. this algorithm, which we have called hottor , enables us to find the hot-spot and its complexity is only proportional to the total number of variables. increasing the number of non-responsive variables does not reduce the significance score.

another interesting finding from our results is the advantage of a system which contains negatively correlated variables compared with one that is positively correlated. it is concluded that the significance score is a decreasing function of the correlation between variables, i.e. it is easier to detect the changes in spatio-temporal patterns if the system is negatively correlated. this also supports one of our long-term working hypotheses that brain neural networks are negatively correlated  <cit>  and which we have recently confirmed using multi-array recording approaches in sensory systems  <cit> .

our approach is first tested on simulated data. it is shown that the hottor algorithm can successfully single out hot-spot variables. we have then applied it to a few examples of biological data sets, including multi-electrode array recording of local field potentials from the brain, gene microarray data and functional magnetic resonance imaging  of the brain. in all cases we find that the hottor algorithm outperforms the conventional anova algorithm or, the most commonly used statistical software statistical parametric mapping  for the case of fmri data.

RESULTS
fig.  <dig> presents a toy example where the hottor algorithm has been applied. the upper panel shows the trajectory of our selection procedure of the hottor algorithm, when ρ <  <dig>  the significance score increases when we complete our calculation of  <dig> variables. we then compare the significance score of each newly picked variable with that of our reference. it is clearly seen that we have successfully found all the changed variables. we have also tested our algorithm with ρ >  <dig> and ρ =  <dig> cases .

when dealing with real-world data, we have to use statistic quantities to check whether adding a variable will increase or decrease the overall score. this is not easily done analytically but we can resort to numerical calculations.

next we test our algorithm on data from a total of  <dig> recording variables generated randomly. the first  <dig> variables of x <dig> follow a multivariate normal distribution with mean =  <dig> . the first  <dig> variables of x <dig> are multivariate normal distributed with mean =  <dig>  the rest of the variables of both x <dig> and x <dig> follow a multivariate normal distribution with mean =  <dig>  the covariance matrix is given by

different from the toy example above, here we face the situation of having to check statistically whether s < s or s > s. this is simply carried out in the following way: the confidence intervals for s and s are constructed at a % significant level. by comparing the upper limit or lower limit of the confidence intervals of s and s, we can determine whether s <s or s > s attain a % significance level. now the hottor algorithm is directly applicable to the data set. the following figure shows the detection process. in fig.  <dig> upper panel, two variables , whose significance scores are smaller than the maximum of all the previous variables, are also statistically different  from them. hence these two variables are included in aq. in the second step, one variable  increases the score, but it is not statistically significant and is not included in aq+. at the end of the process, the hot-spot  could be detected by using hottor algorithm.

in all the examples above, the covariance matrix is fixed in advance. we now consider the case that the covariance matrix is generated randomly. in fig.  <dig> upper panel right, we depict the detected results for  <dig> trials. it is readily seen that the detection is an unbiased algorithm, with a variance as indicated in the figure. the bottom left panel shows the variables which are not significant, but wrongly picked up by the hottor algorithm. fig.  <dig> bottom right panel is a receiver operating characteristic  curve  <cit>  for true positive rate against false negative rate. it is obvious that the algorithm has very good performance to detect the significantly changed variables. all our results above confirm that hottor is capable of picking up changed variables in a complex spatio-temporal data set.

finally we have applied our algorithm to biological data collected from electrophysiological microelectrode array recording and gene microarray experiments to assess whether it is more successful in identifying areas of significant change in comparison with conventional approaches .

in the first example, sheep, under halothane  anaesthesia, were implanted with two chronic 64-channel multielectrode arrays in the right and left inferotemporal cortices, respectively. recordings were made from the unanaesthetised sheep while they performed an operant discrimination task in which different pairs of sheep faces were presented and a correct panel-press response elicited a food reward. the recordings were done by using customized  <dig> channel multi-electrode arrays of bundled tungsten electrodes each separated by  <dig> μm. these multi-electrode arrays were implanted chronically under anaesthesia in both hemispheres of the brain in the infero-temporal cortex region. local event-related lfps are recorded simultaneously from  <dig> chronically implanted electrodes. lfp time series data are sampled at  <dig> samples/s from around  <dig> seconds prior to stimulus onset to  <dig>  seconds after the stimulus onset in each trial of a session, and stored as 16-bit numbers. experiments were carried out in accordance with the uk  <dig> animals  act. a conventional anova test failed to show significant stimulus related changes in any of the  <dig> electrodes; the maximum computed f-value is  <dig> , which is far less than the significance value  <dig> . however when hottor analysis was applied significant changes were found in  <dig> of the  <dig> channels in the right brain hemisphere  and  <dig> of the  <dig> channels in the left.

in a second example a set of microarray data  <cit>  was obtained from a web source  <cit> . microarray data derived from immune b-cells of normal and abnormal human patients were again compared using anova and the hottor algorithm. for simplicity, only  <dig> genes were analyzed and whereas anova failed to identify significant changes in any of them  the hottor algorithm identified changes in eight of them . the genes showing significant changes can be found in the file  <cit> .

in a final example we analyzed data from a functional magnetic resonance imaging  experiment  <cit> . the study chosen aimed to identify brain regions showing activation changes while women and men viewed images of people they were romantically in love with  <cit> . the mri images were taken every  <dig> seconds from  <dig> different slices for  <dig> s before and during exposure to the test pictures. this gives  <dig> images before and during the stimulus with each image captured at  <dig> ×  <dig> pixel resolution. for the purposes of analysis each image pixel was treated as a variable, so we had  <dig> variables with  <dig> replications. to do this we first divided the image into smaller pieces . an analysis of the data using the algorithm revealed a number of significant changes associated with seeing the image of the loved-one . it confirmed significant alterations in activity in the right amygdala, the caudate nucleus and the right retrosplenial cortex as had been reported in the original paper using a standard statistical approach , although the sizes of the areas were slightly different  <cit> . however, the hottor algorithm also identified a new area that was changed significantly, the medial thalamus, which is consistent with patterns of changes reported in other regions.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a novel statistical algorithm to detect hot-spots in complex spatio-temporal data sets derived from biological experiments which avoids the problems inherent with current statistical tests where only small numbers of variables are changing within large scale data sets. such conditions are increasingly encountered in biological experiments that now have the capacity to measure many thousands of variables simultaneously. the algorithm is based upon our theoretical results which found that hot-spots in data are characterized by the non-continuity of the derivative of the significance score. it has been applied successfully to both artificially generated data and real biological data from multi-array electrophysiology, gene array and fmri experiments. the algorithm is particularly effective in identifying changes in spatio-temporal patterns where variable activity is negatively correlated such as we have found recently using multi-array recordings from brain sensory networks  <cit> .

in all of the cases where real biological data has used the algorithm is successful in identifying more significant changes than current standard statistical approaches. changes of a spatio-temporal pattern in a system of negative correlations between units can be more easily detected than that of positive correlations.

when analyzing the local field potentials data, it requires the data to be stationary; at least the data is stationary in a short time interval. the minimum value for sample size n should be larger than the total number of variables. in the present model, the proposed algorithm does not take into account spatio-temporal dependences among the data. the model could include possible geometric or temporal relationships in the data, which would improve the performance and reduce the time cost. the more general case for this method will be investigated in the later publications.

in summary, this new statistical algorithm should provide a powerful new analytical tool to extract the maximum information from complex biological multivariate data.
