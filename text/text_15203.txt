BACKGROUND
mucor circinelloides  is a β-carotene producing fungus and, besides the related blakeslea trispora and phycomyces blakesleeanus, it has been used as a model organism in carotenogenic studies  <cit>  carotenoids and other terpenoids of the fungal cell, such as ergosterol or the prenyl groups of ubiquinone and the farnesylated and geranylgeranylated proteins, are synthesised via the acetate-mevalonate pathway, in which the conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa  to mevalonate is thought to be a rate-limiting step  <cit> . this reaction is catalysed by the hmg-coa reductase , which is therefore considered to be a key enzyme of the terpenoid biosynthesis. characterization of this enzyme and the encoding gene can serve valuable information for the exploitation and improvement of the carotenoid production by mucoral fungi. at the same time, these studies may lead us to better understand various physiological and cell biological processes, such as morphogenesis, synthesis of different metabolites, response to environmental changes  or fungal pathogenesis, in which hmg-coa has been found to have a central role  <cit>  via its participation in the terpenoid biosynthesis, hmg-coa reductase affects so important features of the fungal cell as ergosterol content, membrane structure and fluidity or signalling and regulation processes . moreover, ergosterol is an important component of the fungal cell membrane and the main target of the clinically used antifungal agents. previously, it was reported that treatment with lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of hmg-coa reductase, caused altered processing of mras <dig> protein, blockage of mras <dig> accumulation, decreased growth and sporangiospore germination and apoptosis-like cell death in mucor <cit> .

in the m. circinelloides genome, three genes that potentially encode hmg-coa reductases can be identified  <cit> . however, information on their role in the different biological processes has not been available until to date. therefore, the aim of the present study was to detect differences in their transcript levels and responses to changes of various environmental conditions, which may be relevant from both physiological and biotechnological points of view, such as growth temperature, salinity of the medium, carbon source and oxygen tension. another objective was to examine whether any of the three genes have a special effect on the carotenoid and ergosterol content of the fungus. to answer these questions, transcription of the genes was analysed by real-time quantitative pcr  and mutant strains overexpressing the different isogenes were also constructed.

RESULTS
hmg-coa reductases of m. circinelloides
using blast searches in the mucor genome database , three potential hmg-coa reductase genes were found at the following locations, scaffold_02: 2759562-2763160; scaffold_03: 4299175- <dig> and scaffold_04: 4237143- <dig> and named as hmgr <dig>  hmgr <dig> and hmgr <dig>  respectively. based on these sequence data, specific primers were designed  and the three genes and the appropriate cdnas were isolated. the gene sequences were deposited to ncbi genbank  the three hmgr genes encode the putative hmgr <dig>  hmgr <dig> and hmgr <dig> proteins, which consist of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> amino acids and have  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kda, calculated molecular mass, respectively. main features of the three proteins are summarized in additional file 1: table s <dig>  hmg-coa reductases are membrane-anchored proteins, wherein three main regions can be distinguished: the n-terminal hydrophobic domain containing several transmembrane segments  <cit> , the conserved c-terminal catalytic domain and, between them, a short linker region. these regions, including the putative transmembrane helices and the sterol-sensing domain  in the n-terminal part, were identified . number of the putative transmembrane domains varies in the three proteins, transmembrane domain prediction found six, nine and five transmembrane helices in hmgr <dig>  hmgr <dig> and hmgr <dig>  respectively. the putative pi of three proteins was found to be  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for hmgr <dig>  hmgr <dig> and hmgr <dig>  respectively. the hmg-coa binding motif cenvigympip  <cit>  and the two putative nadh binding sites were found in the catalytic domains of the three proteins . ruiz-albert et al.  <cit>  predicted a short c-terminal pest sequence as a signal for the rapid protein degradation in the hmg-coa reductase of p. blakesleeanus. this signal was found in neither of the hmg-coa reductases of m. circinelloides.

the whole hmgr <dig> protein shows  <dig> and 57% amino acid identity to hmgr <dig> and hmgr <dig>  respectively, while hmgr <dig> and hmgr <dig> have a 55% overall identity to each other. at the same time, the catalytic domain of hmgr <dig> shows  <dig> and 81% sequence identity to those of hmgr <dig> and hmgr <dig>  respectively; the catalytic domain of hmgr <dig> proved to be identical with that of hmgr <dig> in 87%. an alignment and comparison of the amino acid sequences of the three mucor proteins are shown in .

relative transcript levels of the hmgr genes during the cultivation period
rna extractions were performed at different times of cultivation. at  <dig> h postinoculation, germ tubes are just developed while branched hyphae appear at about  <dig> h postinoculation . during the cultivation period, transcript levels of hmgr <dig> and hmgr <dig> showed similar patterns; both reached high amounts already at  <dig> h postinoculation indicating that these transcripts are present in the germinating spores . during the whole cultivation cycle, hmgr <dig> showed the highest relative transcript level at  <dig> h postinoculation, while those of hmgr <dig> and hmgr <dig> reached their maximum values at  <dig> h after the inoculation. additional file 1: figure s <dig> shows the transcript levels of the genes relative to the transcript level of hmgr <dig> at  <dig> hours. in comparison with the other genes, hmgr <dig> showed the highest and hmgr <dig> the lowest relative transcript levels during the whole cultivation cycle. although hmgr <dig> had very low transcript levels in all further experiments , reverse transcription pcr clearly proved the transcription of all three genes .

relative transcript levels of the hmgr genes at different temperatures
relative transcript levels of the three hmgr genes detected after  <dig> days of cultivation at different temperatures are shown in figure  <dig>  the transcript abundance of hmgr <dig> did not run parallel to that of the actin gene, but there was a steady relative decrease with the increasing growth temperatures. apart from slight fluctuations, amounts of the transcripts of hmgr <dig> and hmgr <dig> did not changed at the different temperatures. additional file 1: figure s <dig> shows the transcript levels of the genes relative to the transcript level of hmgr <dig> at 25°c.

effect of salt stress on the transcript levels of the hmgr genes
m. circinelloides was grown for  <dig> days on ynb supplemented with nacl to the final concentrations of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> g/l. transcript levels of all three genes responded to the addition of nacl into the culture medium. transcript level of hmgr <dig> increased in the presence of  <dig> g/l nacl while that of hmgr <dig> continuously increased with the elevating salt concentrations . presentation of the transcript levels of the genes relative to that of the hmgr <dig> in the untreated control indicates that hmgr <dig> had extremely high relative transcript levels on salt containing media in comparison with the other two genes .

relative transcript levels of the hmgr genes on different carbon sources
m. circinelloides was cultivated on solid ynb containing glucose, maltose, sodium acetate, trehalose, or dihydroxyacetone as single carbon sources for  <dig> days . all three genes displayed high transcript levels on sodium acetate and dihydroxyacetone. in case of hmgr <dig> and hmgr <dig>  glucose also induced high transcript abundance. interestingly, relative transcript level of hmgr <dig> on glucose did not differ significantly from those reached on maltose and trehalose. in comparison with the other genes, hmgr <dig> displayed the highest relative transcript levels on all carbon sources .

relative transcript levels of the hmgr genes under aerobic and anaerobic conditions
morphological dimorphism is a characteristic feature of m. circinelloides. in the absence of oxygen and/or at high hexose concentration in the medium, filamentous growth of the fungus switches to a yeast-like form . after growing for  <dig> days under anaerobic condition, relative transcript level of hmgr <dig> significantly decreased, while the transcript concentration of hmgr <dig> was found to be more than three times higher than that observed during aerobic growth . at the same time, transcript levels of hmgr <dig> measured after aerobic and anaerobic growth did not differ significantly. if the anaerobic condition was ceased by placing the cultures in the presence of oxygen for  <dig> hour to induce the shift from the yeast-like morphology to the mycelial form , relative transcript levels of all genes increased, and this increment was the most explicit in the case of hmgr <dig> and hmgr <dig>  if the transcript levels of the genes were correlated to that of the hmgr <dig> at aerobic growth, hmgr <dig> and hmgr <dig> had the highest transcript level during aerobic and anaerobic growth, respectively .

elevation of the copy number of the hmgr genes
m. circinelloides protoplasts were transformed with the circular plasmids, png <dig>  png <dig> and png <dig> containing hmgr <dig>  hmgr <dig> and hmgr <dig>  respectively . transformation frequencies were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> transformant colonies per  <dig> protoplasts for png <dig>  png <dig> and png <dig>  respectively. pcr analysis of the transformants demonstrated that all of them contained the transferred plasmids .

copy number of the transferred plasmids slightly fluctuated in the transformants during the consecutive cultivation cycles . genes introduced into the transformants in extra copies displayed elevated relative transcript levels, while the transcript concentration of the other isoforms did not change significantly . total carotenoid content increased in the transformants harbouring png <dig> and png <dig>  while the ergosterol content only changed slightly in the transformants that contained hmgr <dig> in extra copies .

copy number of the plasmids as well as carotenoid and ergosterol content were measured in three independent transformants. in each case, carotenoid and ergosterol extractions and dna purification were carried out from the same mycelial samples after cultivating the strains on ynb for  <dig> days under continuous light. carotenoid and ergosterol contents are presented as averages ± standard deviation. values followed by * significantly differed from the corresponding value of the ms <dig> strain according to the two-sample t-test .

to test the sensitivity of the different transformants and ms <dig> to statins, mic <dig>  values of fluvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were determined for these strains . sensitivity to statins decreased in the transformants containing png <dig> and png <dig> possibly due to the gene dose effect.

discussion
in this study, transcript levels of three hmg-coa reductase genes of the carotene producing zygomycete fungus mucor circinelloides were examined. this enzyme may be encoded by various numbers of isogenes in the different organisms. animals generally have one hmgr gene; by contrasts, plant genomes may contain multiple genes  <cit> . among fungi, one hmgr gene was found in schizosaccharomyces pombe <cit> , while two isogenes were described in saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> . zygomycetes may contain one or more hmg-coa reductases. in absidia glauca, b. trispora, p. blakesleeanus and rhizomucor miehei, only one gene has been detected  <cit>  while the genome of rhizopus oryzae contains two putative hmgr genes  <cit> ; earlier, burmester and czempinksi  <cit>  also reported two genes in m. mucedo and parasitella parasitica. it can be suggested that a gene duplication event occurred in an ancestor of the zygomycetes and one of the genes was lost in certain lineages, while subsequent duplications occurred in other lineages during the divergence of this fungal group  <cit> . however, expression and regulation of these genes in zygomycetes have not yet been studied. in our tests, presence of the transcripts was proven for all three genes of m. circinelloides and they responded differentially to the changes in the tested cultivation conditions.

in case of hmgr <dig> and hmgr <dig>  patterns of the relative transcript levels differed from that of hmgr <dig> during the cultivation of the fungus. transcripts of hmgr <dig> could be detected only in the mycelium , while those of hmgr <dig> and hmgr <dig> are already present in the germinating spores and achieve high abundance in the young hyphae, i.e. at  <dig> h postinoculation . although it is suggested that hmg-coa reductase and mevalonate pathway affect fungal morphogenesis and polarized growth  <cit> , there are very limited information on their role in the germination of spores and development of hyphae. in an early study, basson et al.  <cit>  reported that s. cerevisiae cells containing mutant alleles of both hmg <dig> and hmg <dig> were unable to undergo spore germination and vegetative growth.

it is known that membrane fluidity and structure, which are affected by the activity of hmg-coa reductase through its role in the ergosterol biosynthesis, are important factors of the adaptation to the changing temperature of the environment. at the same time, cultivation temperature also affects the carotenoid production of mucor <cit> . therefore, we examined the effect of the temperature on the transcript levels of the hmgr genes. the three genes responded differently to the temperature changes . especially, hmgr <dig> showed a temperature dependent transcript abundance, where increasing temperatures caused decreasing relative transcript levels. in case of hmgr <dig> and hmgr <dig>  such temperature dependence in the relative transcript levels was not observed.

previously, hmgr activity and protein level were found to be essential for the adaptation of certain fungi to the changing salinity of the environment  <cit> . thus, we examined whether salt stress has any effect on the transcription of the hmgr genes of m. circinelloides. presence of  <dig> g/l nacl in the medium upregulated all three genes, moreover concentration of hmgr <dig> transcripts increased proportionally with the increasing salt concentrations . modification of the amount and the composition of sterols in the cell membrane is an important factor of the adaptation to the osmotic changes of the environment  <cit> . previously, hmg-coa reductase was found to be regulated by environmental salinity in both salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant yeasts  <cit> . in that study, protein level and activity of hmg-coa reductase in the salt-sensitive s. cerevisiae and the moderately halotolerant a. pullulans increased when these fungi were grown under high salt concentrations.

no data have been found about the effect of different carbon sources on the expression of hmgr genes. therefore, transcription of these genes was examined after cultivating the fungus on five different carbon sources  found to stimulate the carotenoid production  <cit> . all three genes showed high relative transcript levels on sodium acetate and dihydroxyacetone. these compounds take part in the glycolysis and thus, may provide precursors for the mevalonate pathway. acetate was found to affect terpenoid biosynthesis in blakesleea and phycomyces <cit>  and stimulated the hmgr enzyme activity in borrelia burgdorferi <cit> . in case of hmgr <dig> and hmgr <dig>  high transcript levels were detected on glucose also, which is known to be a good carbon source for terpenoid biosynthesis and carotenoid production in mucor <cit> .

compared to the transcript levels detected under aerobic growth, transcript levels of hmgr <dig> and hmgr <dig> changed oppositely under anaerobiosis, while that of hmgr <dig> did not altered significantly . if the relative transcript levels of the genes were compared , hmgr <dig> had the highest transcript level under aerobic cultivation condition during the whole life cycle of the fungus . at the same time, transcripts of hmgr <dig> had a moderate relative abundance under aerobic conditions but the gene displayed the highest relative transcript level compared to the other two genes under anaerobiosis . these results indicate that oxygen level of the environment regulates the hmgr genes of mucor. it is well known that the biosynthesis of ergosterol has high oxygen demand and regulatory effect of low-oxygen conditions on the transcription of the hmgr genes has also been proven in s. cerevisiae, aspergillus fumigatus, cryptococcus neoformans and s. pombe <cit> . somewhat similarly to the situation detected in mucor, availability of oxygen affects the two hmgr genes of s. cerevisiae in an opposite manner: hmg <dig> shows a stable and strong expression during aerobic growth while hmg <dig> transcription is repressed; on the contrary, transcription of hmg <dig> decreases and that of hmg <dig> increases radically when oxygen is depleted  <cit> .

in spite of the increased transcript level of hmgr <dig>  the whole average ergosterol content radically decreased in the anaerobically grown cells  compared to that of the aerobically grown mycelium . similar situation was previously observed in m. genevensis <cit> , which had < <dig>  and  <dig> mg/g  ergosterol content during anaerobic and aerobic growth, respectively.

in the transformation experiments, copy number of the hmgr genes was increased to overexpress them via the gene dose effect and carotenoid and ergosterol content as well as sensitivity to statins were analysed in the transformants. as carotenoids are synthesized through the mevalonate pathway, hmg-coa reductase may affect the carotenoid level and manipulation of the encoding genes has been successfully used to increase the carotenoid content in some organisms  <cit> . it is known that statins are competitive inhibitors of hmg-coa reductase and their antifungal effect, especially against opportunistic human pathogenic fungi, is an intensively studied area  <cit> . in several studies, zygomycetes were proven to be sensitive to these drugs  <cit>  and lovastatin was found to induce apoptosis-like process in mucor <cit> . previously, the hmgr gene of the closely related r. miehei was expressed in m. circinelloides <cit> . in that study, expression of the exogenous hmgr did not affect the carotenoid content of mucor but improved its resistance to fluvastatin. overexpression of both hmgr <dig> and hmgr <dig> raised the carotenoid content  and the resistance of the fungus to statins . these results indicate that the product of the two genes may participate in the same processes or have overlapping functions but their regulations are different, as discussed above. elevation of the copy number of hmgr <dig> only moderately increased the relative transcript level of the gene and did not affect any tested feature. to decide whether hmgr <dig> has any specific role in the cell needs further studies.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, transcription of the three hmg-coa reductase genes of the β-carotene producing model organism, m. circinelloides, was analysed. transcripts could be detected for all three genes but their transcription seems to be under different regulations suggesting functional differences among them. they seem to be especially involved in the adaptation to the changing oxygen tension and osmotic conditions of the environment as well as to statin treatment; overexpression of hmgr <dig> and hmgr <dig> significantly affected the carotenoid content. as the enzymes encoded by these genes have central roles in the terpene biosynthesis, exploration of their function and regulation is useful for further basic studies, e.g. to clarify the background of such important processes as fungal morphogenesis or adaptation to changing environment and in later applied research, e.g to improve the biosynthesis of carotenoids and other terpenoid compounds.
