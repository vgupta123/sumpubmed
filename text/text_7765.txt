BACKGROUND
neosporosis is an infectious disease primarily of cattle and dogs, caused by neospora caninum. n. caninum is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite, which was first recognized in dogs in norway  <cit> , and has been found to infect a wide variety of mammals such as cattle, sheep, goats, deer and horses  <cit> . owing to the similarity of n. caninum to toxoplasma gondii, neosporosis was misdiagnosed as t. gondii infection for many years  <cit> . dogs are the definitive host of n. caninum and cattle are usually its intermediate host. neosporosis now appears to a major cause of abortion in dairy cattle worldwide and causes to huge economic loss to dairy industry  <cit> . most studies of n. caninum have been focused on infections in dairy cattle  <cit> .

n. caninum was identified by immunohistochemistry in two aborted fetuses from argentina in  <dig>  <cit> . there are several developmental stages of the parasite, which differ in size and distribution. the rapidly dividing tachyzoite stage is found within many different cells of the host. tissue cysts are found primarily in nervous tissue and the oocyst stage is in feces excreted from definitive hosts of the parasite. the main mechanism of infection is due either the reactivation of latent tissue cysts or result from the ingestion of oocysts during the gestation period. currently, there is no effective method of control or medical treatment of neosporosis, except the use of intensive farm management practices to reduce the likelihood of infection.

n. caninum possesses specialized secretory organelles called rhoptries, micronemes, and dense granules. proteins secreted from these organelles are considered to play an essential role in intracellular parasitism by this protozoan  <cit> . dense granule antigens  of n. caninum are major components of both the vacuoles surrounding tachyzoites and the cyst wall that surround slower-growing bradyzoites  <cit> , and therefore ncgras might be promising diagnostic tools and important protective antigens. proteins displayed on the surfaces of intracellular pathogens are believed to play critical roles in infection. the n. caninum surface associate antigen  <dig>  and ncsag <dig> related sequence  <dig>  have been identified as major surface antigen proteins of n. caninum tachyzoites, and were demonstrated to be immune-dominant and involved in interactions between the tachyzoite and the host cell  <cit> . their predominant antigenicity was also demonstrated by their recognition by antisera from neospora-infected animals  <cit> .

various diagnostic methods for neosporosis have been developed. for instance, the indirect fluorescent antibody test  was employed to detect anti-n. caninum antibodies in sera of cattle, to evaluate the infection status  <cit> . besides ifat, other serological diagnostic tools such as immunoblotting  <cit> , agglutination tests  <cit>  and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays   <cit>  are also available. for serological evaluation of neosporosis, total proteins of the parasite or recombinant antigens are generally used. recombinant antigens are easily produced in large quantities and can be standardized readily.

with the aims of achieving a reliable diagnosis and developing vaccines, many proteins of n. caninum have been studied. however, the number of recombinant proteins that have been investigated as vaccine candidates is limited. the surface protein ncsrs <dig>  expressed in recombinant vaccinia virus, offered adequate protection against transplacental passage and was found to limit parasite dissemination  <cit> . other proteins, such as ncsag <dig>  <cit>  and ncmic <dig>  <cit>  were also reported to have high antigenicity. a number of proteins from n. caninum have been expressed as inclusion bodies in e. coli, but proteins refolded in vitro may not have the complete original structure, resulting in limited antigenicity.

in this paper, we report the expression and purification of recombinant n. caninum proteins, ncgra <dig>  ncsrs <dig>  and ncsag <dig>  as soluble proteins in e. coli or silkworms. furthermore, a diagnostic method for neosporosis was developed using the recombinant proteins.

RESULTS
expression of mbp-ncgra <dig>  mbp-ncsrs <dig> and ncsag <dig>  and purification
the genes for ncgra <dig> and ncsrs <dig> were amplified by polymerase chain reaction  using appropriate primers  and cloned into a pmal system, with which recombinant proteins could be expressed as fusion proteins with maltose binding protein , as described in figure 1a. mbp-ncgra <dig> and mbp-ncsrs <dig> were expressed as soluble forms in e. coli. the periplasmic fraction and culture supernatant were collected and purified with talon co2+-immobilized resin. the purified proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride  membranes for western blot. the molecular weight of the fusion protein mbp-ncgra <dig> was estimated at approximately 64 kda , which was in agreement with that deduced from its amino acid sequence. the other purified protein, mbp-ncsrs <dig>  with an estimated molecular weight of 90 kda, was also confirmed . ncsag <dig> gene was cloned into a bacmid system and expressed in silkworms . recombinant ncsag <dig> was purified as a single band at about 38 kda , which matched its estimated molecular weight.

antigenicity of recombinant neospora caninum proteins and optimization of assay
to check the antigenicity of the expressed n. caninum proteins and to optimize the amount of protein used for immobilization, an indirect elisa was performed. purified mbp-ncgra <dig>  mbp-ncsrs <dig>  or ncsag <dig> was diluted to final concentrations of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  μg/ml, and immobilized on a microplate at 4°c overnight, respectively. after blocking, neosporosis-negative or -positive cattle sera were added, followed by anti-bovine antibody hrp, and detected by the addition of  <dig> ', <dig> '-tetramethylbenzidine  substrate. high signal intensity was observed in the wells to which serum from neosporosis-positive cattle had been added . on the other hand, only a low signal was detected for neosporosis-negative samples. this demonstrates that the recombinant n. caninum proteins retained the properties of the native proteins of n. caninum, and that mbp-ncgra <dig>  mbp-ncsrs <dig>  and ncsag <dig> have antigenicity sufficient for immunization.

to optimize the amounts of proteins used for immobilization, each recombinant protein at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  μg/ml was analyzed. based on the results, the percent positive value , which was defined as the ratio of the mean absorbance value of sample serum to that of the positive control, as a percentage, was calculated for each concentration of protein. concentrations at which the lowest pp values were obtained were considered to be most suitable. for mbp-ncgra <dig>  the pp values were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  μg/ml, respectively, suggesting that mbp-ncgra <dig> worked well at  <dig> –2 μg/ml and the most suitable concentration should be around  <dig>  μg/ml. for mbp-ncsrs <dig>  the pp values were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . mbp-ncsrs <dig> worked soundly within the range of  <dig>  μg/ml to 2 μg/ml, and  <dig>  μg/ml gave the lowest pp value. pp values for ncsag <dig> at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  μg/ml were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . ncsag <dig> at a lower concentration of  <dig> –1 μg/ml is appropriate for the detection of anti–n. caninum antibodies in cattle serum.

we also optimized the protein concentrations for co-immobilization by a similar method, as described above. a protein cocktail solution including mbp-ncgra <dig>  mbp-ncsrs <dig>  and ncsag <dig> at concentrations of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  μg/ml, respectively, gave an ideal result, and was adopted as the detector for neosporosis.

evaluation of neospora caninum detection
an indirect elisa method was designed to detect bovine n. caninum-specific antibodies in serum with the recombinant n. caninum protein cocktail described above. anti-neospora antibodies–recombinant n. caninum proteins was formed a complex with hrp-conjugated anti-bovine antibodies. the result was observed visually, and the optical density at a wavelength of 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader.

thirty-two serum samples, comprising  <dig> positive and  <dig> negative sera, were employed to evaluate the n. caninum detector. the samples were also tested with individual of mbp-ncgra <dig>  mbp-ncsrs <dig>  ncsag <dig>  or a commercial n. caninum isocom elisa kit . if the pp value was smaller than  <dig>  the cattle were determined to be negative; if it was equal to or greater than  <dig>  the cattle were thought to be infected with n. caninum. as shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  among the  <dig> neosporosis-positive samples,  <dig> were distinguished and only no. <dig> serum sample was misclassified. none of the  <dig> neosporosis-negative serum samples was misclassified with the cocktail detector. on the basis of these data, the sensitivity of this assay was found to be  <dig> % and the specificity 100%, when compared with the commercial n. caninum iscom elisa kit.

*the concentrations of mbp-ncgra <dig>  mbp-ncsrs <dig> and ncsag <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  μg/ml for both individual and co-immobilization.

elisas were also carried out with single protein immobilized for the  <dig> serum samples. when we only immobilized mbp-ncgra <dig>  two serum samples, no.  <dig> and no.  <dig> serum samples were misclassified, giving a sensitivity of  <dig> % . similar result to protein cocktail was obtained when only either mbp-ncsrs <dig> or ncsag <dig> was immobilized, however, pp values for most serum samples were lower than immobilization of protein cocktail. co-immobilization of three proteins improved the reliability of the assay with a single protein.

diagnosis of neosporosis with serum samples from dairy cattle
another group, comprising  <dig> serum samples from dairy farms in the shizuoka prefecture of japan, was also tested with both the method developed in this study and the n. caninum iscom elisa kit. the diagnostic results matched very well, and one serum sample was found to be positive for infection with n. caninum using both methods. an additional file shows this in more detail . the pp values of all the serum samples tested by the method developed in this study and by a commercial iscom elisa kit were compared. the new method showed high values in the positive area  in most positive samples .

discussion
neosporosis is a very common disease worldwide, and losses to livestock farms that result from neosporosis-related abortions are a huge problem. given that no therapy or effective vaccine is available currently, diagnosis and protection are very important to dairy farms. in this study, we developed a diagnostic method based on recombinant n. caninum proteins, mbp-ncgra <dig>  mbp-ncsrs <dig>  and ncsag <dig>  an elisa with co-immobilization of those three proteins gave ideal results in both the development and validation steps. we also tried to immobilize those proteins separately; however, the results were not as good as with co-immobilization. for instance, one more positive sample was misclassified when we immobilized only mbp-ncgra <dig> for use in the elisa. individual immobilization of mbp-ncsrs <dig> or ncsag <dig> resulted in lower pp values for positive serum samples than co-immobilization of three proteins.

other proteins, such as ncmic <dig>  <cit> , ncmic <dig>  <cit> , and gra <dig>  <cit>  have also been reported to have antigenicity. therefore addition of those proteins to the diagnostic test might increase the sensitivity of the assay. in addition, some assays use inactivated total proteins of the parasite as a detector for the diagnosis of neosporosis. however, given that some proteins of n. caninum have high similarity to those of t. gondii <cit> , total proteins of parasites might result in misclassification. ncgra <dig>  ncsrs <dig> and ncsag <dig> have identities of 33%, 43% and 51% to those of t. gondii, respectively. according to the report of nishikawa et al.  <cit> , no cross-reaction was observed between ncsrs <dig> and that of t. gondii. therefore, they could be used to distinguish these two infectious diseases.

two proteins were expressed in an e. coli protein expression system, which is a cost-effective method of producing large quantities of high-quality recombinant proteins  <cit> . however, this approach is often insufficient for soluble expression of recombinant proteins. the structural genomics center has estimated that up to 50% of all prokaryotic proteins are insoluble when expressed in e. coli <cit> . so far, many proteins of n. caninum have been expressed in e. coli, and most of them were expressed as inclusion bodies  <cit> . in this case, refolding procedures are necessary in order to obtain biofunctional proteins. although some proteins recover their activity after refolding treatments, it is still difficult to reproduce the complete properties of the native protein.

we expressed soluble ncgra <dig> and ncsrs <dig> by fusing them with mbp, which is capable of functioning as a general molecular chaperone in the context of a fusion protein  <cit> . moreover, mbp did not hinder the immunoassay used in this study, which suggests that it may aid the production of protein on a large scale. we also tried to express ncsag <dig>  but unfortunately we could not obtain a soluble fraction. however, use of the bmnpv bacmid expression system, with both the cysteine-protease and chitinase genes deleted , led to successful expression of ncsag <dig> in silkworm larvae as a soluble fraction, with less protein degradation. the viral protease and chitinase activities in the hemolymph of the silkworm larvae were reduced by  <dig> and 50%, respectively  <cit> .

given that the tachyzoite is a very infectious stage of n. caninum, many studies of vaccination and detection have been focused on this stage. ncgra <dig> is usually contained in dense granules, and it is highly expressed in culture-derived tachyzoites, therefore it has been studied as a potential vaccine candidate. however, so far there has been no study on the diagnosis of neosporosis that has used this protein as a detector. in this study, this protein bound to n. caninum-specific antibodies in serum samples from cattle, which suggests that ncgra <dig> is a good candidate protein for use in diagnostic assays. the combination of ncgra <dig>  ncsrs <dig>  and ncsag <dig> resulted in reliable detection of neosporosis.

the new method showed high values in the positive area in most positive samples than a commercial iscom elisa kit, which suggests that this method may show a higher level of response to anti neospora antibodies than the commercial elisa kit. among the  <dig> samples tested, only one positive sample, no. <dig> serum sample, was misclassified as negative using our method . however, the pp value of this sample calculated with the commercial elisa kit was  <dig> , which was very close to the boundary value for interpretation; that obtained with our method was  <dig> .

in addition to cattle, naturally occurring neonatal or fetal infections caused by neospora-like protozoa have been described in dogs, goats  <cit> , horses  <cit> , and sheep  <cit> . therefore, this diagnostic method may have wide applicability to other animal species.

CONCLUSIONS
a diagnostic method employing recombinant proteins of n. caninum was developed. the method showed high sensitivity and specificity, suggesting its applicability to the practical diagnosis of neosporosis.
