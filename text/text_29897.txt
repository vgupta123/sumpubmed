BACKGROUND
variability in human mitochondrial dna  offers valuable information to trace the genetic history of humans, because of the high rate of mutation and absence of recombination. analyses of the frequency of variation and distribution of mtdna haplogroups have been used to evaluate current models concerning the process of colonization of world. south asia, particularly india, lies on the path of the earliest human dispersal from africa  <cit>  and hence this holds an important site of information on early human migrations.

macrohaplogroups 'm' and 'n' have evolved almost in parallel from a founder haplogroup l <dig>  a number of mtdna studies based on hvs i in indian populations have been carried out, and some information have been made available about the genetic structure of indian gene pool  <cit> . macrohaplogroup n in india has already been defined  <cit> , and recently the macrohaplogroup m among the indian populations has also been characterized  <cit> .

the origin of mtdna macrohaplogroup m has been an issue of controversy. macrohaplogroup m is found mainly in asia, and its various clades makeup the great majority of indian and mongoloid lineages. it was hypothesized that its high frequency and diversity in ethiopia may indicate an african origin for the entire m  <cit> . nevertheless, m is geographically limited to africa, while it is prevalent in asia. if m originated in africa, then it must have occurred at an ancient time, since it had to spread throughout asia and the new world. however, it is paradoxical that m crossed such a vast distance and failed to accomplish other populations of africa, except ethiopians and few egyptians. the lack of time depth and classification of subhalogroups in the case of most of the lineages in the recent paper  <cit>  tends us to reconstruct the phylogeny of macrohaplogroup m, which harbors more than 60% of the indian mtdna lineage  <cit> .

RESULTS
in this study we defined one novel haplogroup m <dig>  and revised the classification of haplogroups m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig>  the remaining haplogroups are also classified into subhaplogroups  by including our complete sequence information . the geographical distributions of these samples with their haplogroup affiliation are given in fig.  <dig> and the populations and their linguistic affiliations are described in table  <dig> 

we have revised the classification of haplogroup m <dig> that was previously characterized by a coding region mutation  <dig> and two control region substitutions  <dig> and  <dig>  in our survey of > <dig> samples across india, we found a considerable number of samples that have mutations at nps  <dig> and  <dig> but don't have mutation at  <dig> . this suggests that  <dig> and  <dig> are the basal mutations of this haplogroup, and  <dig> might have originated later and this represent subhaplogroup m3a. haplogroup, m <dig> was previously characterized by only the hvs i mutation , but now we have defined this haplogroup by two coding region mutations , and an additional control region mutation  .

further, we have defined several subhaplogroups based on the sharing mutations between our own and sun et al.  <cit>  data . subhaplogroup m3a defined by a coding region mutation at  <dig>  m4a defined by two coding  and three control region  mutations. subhaplogroup m6b defined by two coding region mutations . m33a defined by two coding substitution ; and m34a by six coding region  and three control region  mutations. m37a defined by a single coding  and two control region  mutations. m40a defined by a coding  and three control region  mutations. interestingly, haplogroups m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> shared a common coding region mutation  from the root of haplogroup m  and later differentiated by coding and control region mutations . we have defined one novel haplogroup, designated as m <dig>  by six coding  and three control  region mutations with the t <dig> sequence of sun et al.  <cit>  . m <dig> has also been tentatively classified in three subhaplogroups m41a, m41b and m41c. one complete sequence o <dig> from andamanese specific haplogroup m31a has also been included here that defines subhaplogroup m31a <dig> by a single coding  as well as a control region  substitution. our reanalysis of this lineage suggests population-specific two clear-cut subclades of m31a in this island. m31a <dig> specific mutations  <dig> and  <dig> are exclusively present in onge and jarwa populations while  <dig> defining m31a <dig> clade is present in only greater andamanese individuals . all the coding region diagnostic mutations of macrohaplogroup m subhaplogroups are listed in table  <dig> 

we have also calculated the age estimates for all m branches  both by using the estimated mutation calibration rate of mishmar et al.  <cit> , which has been recently applied in most of the mtdna studies  <cit> , and ρ  and a mutation rate of one transition per  <dig>  years between nps 16090– <dig>  <cit> . standard errors for coalescence time calculation were calculated following saillard et al  <cit> . we found some conflict between the age estimated by both of the methods. since, the complete sequences do not reflect the actual population size and geographical distribution, former method  <cit>  has been used for colescent time estimation. the detailed coalescent time list is given in additional file  <dig> 

it is interesting to note that most of the new m lineages are deep rooting, and more likely arose in situ in the indian subcontinent just after the arrival of the anatomically modern humans . as shown in the figure  <dig>  it is apparent that all the autochthonous lineages under analysis emerge directly from the root of the macrohaplogroup m. there is no intermediate lineage shared by any two haplogroups, except for haplogroup m4' <dig> . the star-like and non-overlapping pattern  indicates that all the lineages have originated independently from the root of the macrohaplogroup m, thus supporting a rapid dispersal of modern humans along the asian coast after they left africa, followed by a long period of isolation  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, based on well-resolved mtdna macrohaplogroup m phylogeny, it can be confirmed with the recent studies  <cit>  that a rapid dispersal of modern human took place in one wave along the asian coast. the deep roots of m phylogeny clearly ascertain the relic of indian lineages as compared to other m sub lineages suggesting 'in-situ' origin of these sub-haplogroups in south asia, most likely in india. these deep rooting lineages are not language specific and spread over all the language groups in india. moreover, our reanalysis of andamanese-specific lineage m <dig> suggests population specific two clear-cut subclades. onge and jarwa share m31a <dig> branch while m31a <dig> clade is present only in great andamanese individuals .
