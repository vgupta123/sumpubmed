BACKGROUND
quantitative models describing gene expression in terms of quantity, speed and timing in different environmental contexts are essential for the study of many biological processes. thermodynamic models are based on the assumption that the level of gene expression is proportional to the equilibrium probability that rna polymerase  is bound to the promoter of the interested gene and these probabilities can be computed in a statistical mechanics framework. in prokaryotes under well studied assumptions, a function is available to relate each particular form of interaction among transcription factors  and rnap to the level of the expression of the target gene  <cit> . such functions are termed “regulation factors”  <cit> . there are to date few discussions on the extent to which these regulation factors hold for eukaryotes  <cit> .

in this paper we propose a method to select regulation factors, i.e. to infer the form of tf-tf and tf-rnap interactions for each target gene. this method enables the investigation of regulation factors from empirical data in eukaryotic systems. applying this method to a time course microarray dataset of retinoid acid induced differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells   <cit> , we clearly distinguish different interaction forms among oct <dig>  sox <dig> and nanog, and their roles as activators, repressors and helpers on each target gene. the detailed characterization of interaction forms among multiple transcription factors allows us to build a core transcription network in escs using a bottom-up approach.

escs are derived from early mammalian embryos and can be propagated through apparently unlimited, undifferentiated proliferation  in cultured cell lines . escs possess several notable properties that account for their exceptional scientific and medical importance. escs have remarkable potential to develop into many different cell types in the body  and therefore they may be used to study both normal and abnormal body developments. a major challenge in the study of escs is to explain how the complex gene network is wired to control their properties of pluripotency and self-renewal. transcriptional control is thought to be a key control mechanism for escs to maintain their undifferentiated state  <cit> . regulatory proteins and relevant genomic sequences work together to precisely tune the expression levels of thousands of target genes in escs. the interactions among these regulatory proteins and their interactions with particular genomic sequences collectively define a transcription network. understanding of the part of the network at work in escs, i.e. the functional state of the transcription network in escs, can reveal how the undifferentiated state of escs is maintained, and how it can be disrupted to initiate different routes of differentiation.

RESULTS
simulation data
we use three regulatory patterns to test our new algorithm . under the first regulatory pattern , we do two simulations . first, tf's expression increases linearly over time: real_tf_exp = 500+500t, where t= <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in the second simulation the tf's expression increases exponentially over time: real_tf_exp = 500+200logt, where t= <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  because there is only one tf in consideration, there are only two candidate regulatory models, either repression  or activation . in both simulations our method correctly picks model  <dig> . two simulations are performed under the second regulatory pattern . for each simulation, our method consistently identifies the correct regulatory model out of five candidate models . under the third regulatory pattern, we do a two-step analysis. in the first step, we apply the method to identify the regulatory relationship between tfs a and b , i.e. one tf controls the expression of another tf. after a regulatory model is determined between a and b, we use the expression pattern of b derived from the step  <dig> to identify the interaction form between tfs b and c. there are two candidate models for step  <dig> and five candidate models for step  <dig>  altogether  <dig> potential regulatory models exist among the four genes. in two independent simulations, our method has both identified the correct regulatory models .

sensitivity analysis
we check to what extent the choices of parameters affect the method performance. regulatory model  <dig>  is chosen to perform the sensitivity analysis. we vary ktf, kg, kd and qp in wide ranges, for example an  <dig> fold range for ktf, and re-run our algorithm. results in table  <dig> show that the method can robustly identify the correct regulatory model even if the parameters are varied by  <dig> fold. the only exceptions are the cases where the synthesis rates of mrna are set to be too slow – below  <dig> mrna molecule per  <dig> minute, as compared to the default of  <dig> mrna per minute from empirical data. we therefore do not suggest using a very small synthesis rate.

numbers in bold represent the highest correlations under each parameter set. the results indicate that the correct model can be identified even with drastic variation in parameters used in the model.

interaction models for oct <dig> and nanog in mouse embryonic stem cells
oct <dig>  sox <dig> and nanog are the key transcription factors to maintain pluripotency escs. nanog is known to be jointly regulated by oct <dig> and sox <dig> 

time course microarray data have been generated for retinoid acid induced differentiation of mouse escs  <cit> . genes that are jointly regulated by oct <dig> and nanog have been reliably identified  <cit> . among these target genes, nine genes  are represented on the affymetrix u <dig> microarray and therefore their time course data are available  <cit> . we first apply the interaction-identifier method to identify the regulatory model for nanog, following the same procedure as we did for the synthetic data. the time course expression data suggest that oct <dig> and sox <dig> help each other to stabilize onto the regulatory sequence and attract the rnap . we then identify the regulatory models for the oct <dig> and nanog regulated genes. although these nine genes are all regulated by oct <dig> and nanog in escs, they are not regulated under the same mechanism. jarid <dig>  sall <dig>  rif <dig> and gbx <dig>  are regulated under model  <dig> , where oct <dig> and nanog are synergistic activators. rest and zic <dig> are both regulated under model  <dig>  with one tf being an activator and the other a helper . atbf <dig> is regulated under model  <dig> where oct <dig> and nanog are independent repressors . foxc <dig> is regulated under model  <dig> where nanog is a helper and oct <dig> is a repressor . these results suggest that atbf <dig> and foxc <dig> are probably involved in lineage differentiation and therefore need to be repressed by key transcription factors in escs. indeed, foxc <dig> is involved in ocular development  <cit>  and abf <dig> mrna is found to be abundant in prostate  <cit> . finally, none of the models being considered derives an expression pattern similar to the observed expression pattern of smarcad <dig> . this may suggest that besides oct <dig> and nanog, there are other mechanisms responsible for the transcriptional control of smarcad <dig> 

discussion
new algorithms combining the strengths of both mechanistic modeling and statistical inference approaches to identify genetic regulatory networks are in demand. the methodology proposed in this study is one step towards this goal. this new method integrates three pieces of information together to infer a genetic regulatory network: a) mechanistic models of transcription factor binding and rna transcription  <cit> , b) prior knowledge of network components based on chip-chip data, c) time course expression data. furthermore, this method combines two methodologies together, kinetic modelling and correlation analysis. in the following, we further compare this new method with previous efforts in the same vein and explain the rationale and assumptions of this new approach.

we choose to represent the expression levels as continuous instead of discrete variables in this study. reverse engineering approaches have been developed to infer boolean networks underlying changes in the gene expression levels, assuming that expression levels of different genes can be categorized into different states  <cit> . in reality, gene expression levels reflected by microarray data tend to be continuous rather than discrete. furthermore, continuous signals have a greater capacity over discrete signals in implementing different control functions, such as signal transformation and transduction, precise feedback and feed forward loops and maintaining homeostasis  <cit> . an implicit assumption of using continuous concentrations of the chemical species  is that the stochastic fluctuations due to single molecules are ignored. in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, noises in gene expression levels have been observed and suggested to be an evolvable trait, which possibly plays a role in cellular phenotypic variation and cellular differentiation  <cit> . both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression  and fluctuations in other cellular components  contribute substantially to overall phenotypic variation  <cit> . in this study, the mrna signals obtained are effectively averages of pooled populations of cells; where the influence of stochastic noise of single molecules on chemical concentration  are presumably effectively decreased.

three other assumptions are made in the methodological framework. first the form of the interaction among tfs and rnap are assumed to be invariant for the different conditions under which the gene expression data are obtained. this assumption can be violated when the experimental conditions are dramatically different from each other, for example, under different stress conditions. this assumption is better satisfied by using data from one biological process, for example, a developmental process. for this reason we suggest using time course gene expression data rather than data generated from different experimental conditions. even for time course data, the users should exercise caution, because the regulation factor can still change in some circumstances, such as when the cell goes through different phases of the cell cycle  <cit> . the second assumption is that the transcriptome is at equilibrium state at each time point when the gene expression is measured. this assumption is satisfied by most of the time course microarray data that the authors are aware of, and users can check this assumption by examining the reproducibility of the data among biological replicates. the third and the biggest assumption is that the thermodynamic models derived and tested for prokaryotes can be applied to eukaryote systems. this is essentially ignoring a number of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that eukaryotes utilize, such as chromatin modification and enhancer effects. however as an approximation, the interaction-identifier method is still useful to analyze the biophysical properties of known tfs. another point in favor of the validity of this method is that the absolute value of the model-derived gene expression level does not influence the correlation calculation. only the pattern of change of the expression levels over time influence the correlation calculation. many of the eukaryotic specific regulatory features, such as the distance between the enhancer and the promoter, are invariant for the target gene over the time course, and therefore such features should not affect the selection of the corrected model.

previously, models were developed to infer genetic regulatory networks from time series data that are generated before the equilibrium is reached  <cit> . there are, however, a lot more experiments generating gene expression data at steady states in a time series manner. in this paper we demonstrate that steady state time series data can be utilized to effectively characterize the interaction forms among multiple transcription factors. the interaction-identifier method should therefore be applicable to analyze a larger number of biological processes where steady state time course data are available. 

CONCLUSIONS
we developed interaction-identifier methods for identifying interaction forms of tfs. we applied it to analyze the combinatorial control of the key transcription factors in mouse escs. escs are pluripotent cells derived from the inner cell mass of the mammalian blastocyst. they are capable of indefinite self-renewing expansion in culture. depending on culture conditions, these cells can differentiate into a variety of cell types  <cit> . the ability to steer esc differentiation into specific cell types holds great promise for regenerative medicine  <cit> . a few transcription factors have shown to be key transcriptional regulators in escs. these include oct <dig>  sox <dig>  nanog and others  <cit> . large scale genomic data have been generated for these regulators, including chip-pet   <cit>  and time course microarray data  <cit> . albeit the availability of the high-throughput genomic data, the regulatory circuit in esc still await quantitative and realistic models to be described. we regard a realistic model for quantifying the effect of combinatorial control of multiple esc regulators as a firm building block towards understanding the whole network. in this paper we explored interaction-identifier method to infer the interaction patterns between multiple esc regulators. in particular, interaction-identifier method identifies that oct <dig> and sox <dig> help each other to stabilize onto dna and attract the rnap. this indicates that the dna-bound oct <dig> will be less in sox <dig> knock-down escs, and vice versa. this is in line with the fact that the knock-down of either of the two transcription factors will decrease the expression levels of the mutual target genes and start the differentiation process  <cit> . we have subsequently categorized the mutual targets of oct <dig> and nanog according to the pattern of their combinatorial effect. although oct <dig> and nanog often serve as activators for maintaining the expression of esc specific genes, they also inhibit genes for lineage specific differentiation. little is known about how oct <dig> and nanog switch their tasks between activators and repressors. among all the identified regulatory patterns, oct <dig> and sox <dig> generally do not attract rnap at the same time, but rather one serves as the helper to the other . only in one case oct <dig> and nanog both interact with rnap, where both serve as repressors . this result suggests that when both of the two transcription factors interact with rnap, they perform an inhibition task.
