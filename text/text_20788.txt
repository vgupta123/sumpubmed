BACKGROUND
marine photosynthetic plankton are responsible for approximately half of global carbon fixation  <cit> . prasinophytes are a major lineage of unicellular green algae that can contribute significantly to marine primary production . in the oceans, prasinophyte genera within class ii are particularly widespread. these algae include the picoplanktonic  genera bathycoccus, micromonas and ostreococcus which have small genomes  and less gene family expansion than observed in other viridiplantae groups , specifically chlorophyte algae and streptophytes  <cit> . like chlorophytes, prasinophytes provide insights into ancestral viridiplantae gene families. for example, key transcription factors formerly considered innovations in vascular plants are present in micromonas although absent from model chlorophytes, such as chlamydomonas reinhardtii and non-vascular plants like physcomitrella patens   <cit> .fig.  <dig> relationships of photosynthetic eukaryotes in the archaeplastida. the cladogram was inferred with the cprev + g model using maximum likelihood methods and a concatenated alignment of  <dig> plastid-genome encoded proteins. bootstrap support >50 % is shown. plastid genome information is lacking for o. lucimarinus and rcc <dig>  therefore, branching within the ostreococcus clade is based on branching in the 18s rrna gene tree  <cit>  and is represented with dashed lines



the first described eukaryotic picoplankter was chromulina pusilla  <cit> , later renamed micromonas pusilla. micromonas forms at least seven phylogenetically distinct clades, six of which have cultured representatives . these clades appear to often co-exist in mid- to low- latitude systems  <cit> , with the exception of micromonas clade e <dig> which is found in polar environments but not lower latitude surface oceans  <cit> . abundance of the latter has reportedly increased in the canadian arctic in association with climate induced changes  <cit> . like micromonas, the genus bathycoccus is also found from tropical to polar systems, but is much less phylogenetically diverse  <cit> . their sister genus ostreococcus is found only in mid- and low- latitude waters and has several established clades with distinct environmental distributions  <cit> .

morphologically the three genera have marked differences. all have a single chloroplast and lack visible cell walls. unlike bathycoccus and other known prasinophytes, micromonas and ostreococcus do not have scales  <cit> . additionally, bathycoccus and ostreococcus are non-motile while micromonas has a flagellum  and is larger than the former two taxa. genomes have been sequenced for micromonas species representing clades d  and a   <cit> . in addition, three ostreococcus and one bathycoccus species have completely sequenced genomes , while targeted bathycoccus metagenomes have been sequenced from coastal chile  <cit>  and the tropical atlantic ocean  <cit> . the micromonas nuclear genomes are  <dig> mb  and 21 mb , while the genomes of bathycoccus prasinos  and various ostreococcus  are smaller . genomes of all three genera contain two chromosomes with lower gc% than the overall average . the larger low-gc region  is a proposed sex chromosome, while the other is much smaller and has few recognizable genes  <cit> . the rcc <dig> genome sequence is gapless, with telomere to telomere sequenced chromosomes  <cit> . in contrast the ccmp <dig> genome was published as a high quality draft genome  in  <dig> scaffolds representing  <dig> chromosomes.

to further develop genomic resources for class ii prasinophytes , we finished sequences from four ccmp <dig> chromosomes and developed new gene models for both ccmp <dig> and rcc <dig> using evidence-based methods, including directional illumina rna-seq and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry  proteomics. analyses of these datasets revealed characteristics of gene architecture, novel repetitive introns and deviations in splice donor sequence. we also analyzed the predicted proteome of polar clade e <dig> isolate ccmp <dig> and generated genomic information for a more basal class ii prasinophyte by growing and sequencing the transcriptome of dolichomastix tenuilepis. our comparative studies identified proteins that are likely involved in scale formation and features of the land plant ancestor as well as essential components of photosynthesis. among these is the presence of a bacterial-like peptidoglycan pathway that has been retained in lineages from across the archaeplastida supergroup , but selectively lost in multiple independent events. our studies highlight the complementarity of two evolutionary distinct green algal groups, represented by micromonas and chlamydomonas, for investigating plant systems and provide new insights into the development of the green lineage.

RESULTS
genome improvement and evidence-based gene models
we finished four chromosomes in ccmp <dig> which reduced the total number of gaps in the genome sequence from  <dig> to  <dig>  specifically, scaffolds  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were finished by closing all gaps, improving low quality regions and resolving repeat structures. these four chromosomes now represent  <dig> , <dig> base pairs  of finished sequence . of the other scaffolds in the initially published genome build  <cit> , scaffolds  <dig>  and  <dig>  are not considered to be full chromosomes, because the former represents an unresolved repeat unit on scaffold  <dig> and the latter is rdna. the newly finished chromosome  <dig> is the smallest  in the genome, and has 51 % gc. chromosome  <dig> contains the lgc , which spans  <dig>  mb of its total  <dig>  mb. the remainder of chromosome  <dig> is 63 % gc, similar to the overall genome average . the total chromosome count is  <dig> for rcc <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig> for ccmp <dig>  we performed transmission electron microscopy on ccmp <dig> and rcc <dig> which showed similar morphologies and structures, with the chloroplast occupying more than half the cell .fig.  <dig> 
micromonas pusilla and m. commoda cellular structures and gene model sets. transmission electron micrographs of ccmp <dig>  and rcc <dig>  show the chloroplast  comprising more than half the cell, the pyrenoid , nucleus  and flagellum  with microtubules visible . in rcc <dig> the beginning of the flagellar hair  is also visible as are the thylakoid membranes in ccmp <dig> . evidence for new gene models in ccmp <dig>  and rcc <dig>  is shown based on: function: predicted protein had a functional domain hit in interproscan; transcribed: predicted gene model was expressed  in the rna-seq experiment; lc-ms peptides: at least one peptide matching the predicted protein was identified in the lc-ms/ms analysis; conserved: blastp hits were found in ncbi’s nr database . the total number of genes with no evidence:  <dig>  and  <dig> . note that for rcc <dig> the lower number of gene models supported by lc-ms/ms data  than in ccmp <dig>  is due to generation of fewer peptides



two forms of biological evidence for protein-encoding genes were generated for each micromonas species. three hundred and twenty six million paired-end rna-seq reads were generated for each micromonas isolate alongside  <dig>   and  <dig>   peptide spectra generated by lc-ms/ms. these forms of evidence were used to score, select and modify the best gene model for each locus from an “allgenes” model set generated using multiple prediction algorithms  <cit>  and to generate new models at previously unannotated loci. the new ccmp <dig> protein-encoding gene model set contains  <dig> fewer genes than the initially published gene catalog  <cit>  . the reduction was primarily due to merging of adjacent gene models according to new transcriptional evidence and resulted in longer average gene length. in rcc <dig>  average protein-encoding gene size increased largely due to 5′ coding region extension . removal of unsupported rcc <dig> gene models, gene merging, and creation or addition of models based on new evidence resulted in a set that contained  <dig> more protein-encoding gene models than the prior catalog  <cit> . average exon size increased by  <dig>  and 23 %  because of additional untranslated region  sequence and because average coding length increased . overall, the new models were  <dig>  and 21 %  longer than the original models.table  <dig> comparison of the evidence-based  protein coding gene model sets predicted here for the nuclear genomes of micromonas pusilla  and micromonas commoda  and the original model sets  published in worden et al.  <dig>  <cit> 

note that for average transcript and coding lengths introns have been removed. for the eb sets gene characteristics were computed on  <dig>  and  <dig>  proteins, to which  <dig> and  <dig> models were later added, respectively, due to new rna-seq support. abbreviation: n.c., not computed



four independent tests were used to assess gene models and validity of predicted proteins. specifically,  conservation of predicted proteins was examined using blastp searches  against ncbi’s non-redundant protein set ;  transcription was verified using rna-seq data;  translation was verified using lc-ms/ms support; and  predicted function was characterized using interproscan  <cit> . the vast majority  of ccmp <dig> protein-encoding gene models had supporting evidence, while  <dig> did not . ninety-eight percent of genes were confirmed using rna-seq, and 96 % were supported by at least two types of evidence. of the  <dig> predicted proteins with only interproscan evidence,  <dig> were related sel- <dig> like repeat  proteins. for rcc <dig>  97 % of models were confirmed with rna-seq and 94 % were supported by at least two evidence types , while  <dig> gene models had no evidence. twelve predicted proteins from mixed families of unknown function  had only interproscan support.

gene overlap
for both species, gene density is lower than average on the smallest chromosomes . gene density is also lower in the lgc, but unlike the smallest chromosomes, lgc genes are often organized in convergent overlapping pairs . these have overlapping 3′ utrs and relatively large intergenic distances to their respective upstream  neighbors. in the ccmp <dig> lgc,  <dig> of  <dig> genes occur as cops, with an average intergenic distance of  <dig>   nucleotides  between the cop and non-cop neighbors. the average intergenic distance on the other  <dig> chromosomes is 211 ± 398 nt. similarly, in the rcc <dig> lgc,  <dig> of  <dig> genes occur in cops, with intergenic distances of 898 ± 810 nt that contrast with the average for the other  <dig> chromosomes of 167 ± 238 nt. cop numbers are likely underestimated because we required est evidence  as validation of overlapping models. visual inspection of the rna-seq evidence indicates that many more tail to tail overlaps occur among lgc genes. overlap between protein-coding genes in eukaryotes has been suggested as a mechanism for reciprocal regulation  <cit> . for single cell organisms such as micromonas, physical separation of cytoplasmic biochemical pathways is only feasible through temporal regulation and indeed rhythmic patterns in gene expression have been found in ostreococcus  <cit>  and ccmp <dig>  <cit> . further studies are needed to establish whether reciprocal regulation of cops provides a mechanism for temporal partitioning of cellular processes and expressional programs in unicellular organisms.

architectural and intronic novelties
ccmp <dig> and rcc <dig> have two clear differences in gene architecture; both are related to intron characteristics. we identified numerous gc splice donors in ccmp <dig>  that were largely absent in initial predictions. this is likely because most prediction programs require gt/ag splice donor/acceptor pairs while the short read sequence aligner used here  <cit>  accommodates both gt and gc splice donors. to our knowledge, only the marine haptophyte alga emiliania huxleyi has more gc splice donors   <cit>  than ccmp <dig>  unlike ccmp <dig>  the  <dig>  % gc splice donors in rcc <dig>  is nearly identical to other viridiplantae, such as the streptophytes arabidopsis thaliana  and brassica rapa  .

ccmp <dig> also has twice as many introns as rcc <dig>  although both species contain similar numbers of nucleus-encoded genes . many of the introns in ccmp <dig> are introner elements , a type of spliceosomal intron that has recognizable branch points, but also has high sequence identity throughout the genome   <cit> . ie fragment the gene models produced by some prediction algorithms. to identify ie here, predicted introns in ccmp <dig> were clustered to identify those with sequence similarity. a motif finder was used to identify sequence motifs; two groups of non-overlapping motifs were found: a four motif group that identified ie <dig>  ie <dig>  and ie <dig> as reported in , and a three motif group that recognizes ie <dig> . we will refer to these as d-ie <dig> and d-ie <dig> , respectively.

the non-overlapping motif sets had  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides between those present in an intron  and were used to identify a total of  <dig>  complete d-ie:  <dig>  d-ie <dig> matched all of the motifs in the four motif group and  <dig> d-ie <dig> matched all the motifs in the three motif group. in addition to complete matches to the four motif  group,  <dig>  partial d-ies were identified. among these,  <dig> matched three of the four d-ie <dig> motifs,  <dig> matched two d-ie <dig> motifs, and  <dig>  matched only one d-ie <dig> motif . two full d-ie1s and one d-ie <dig> matched all four  motifs, but with an internal duplication, possibly due to a merge of two originally complete d-ie1s. partial d-ie <dig> elements were also found. these contained only two  motifs or just one . in  <dig> of the  <dig>  cases where a d-ie <dig> contained only one motif, that motif was present in multiple copies. mixed-motif partials, with motifs from d-ie <dig> and d-ie <dig>  occurred seven times. the large number of partial motifs inside introns indicates that both d-ie <dig> and d-ie <dig> are diverging from their source sequence and that much of the specific primary sequence of the ie is not necessary for splicing, supporting hypotheses put forth in  <cit> .fig.  <dig> introner elements  and intron splice donor features.  d-ie <dig> and d-ie <dig> contain four and three motif groups, respectively. minimum and maximum nucleotide stretches intervening between motifs are indicated.  ccmp <dig> contains a high percentage of gc splice donors in ie containing introns  as well as regular spliceosomal introns . splice donor motifs are shown for gt and gc motifs in both rsis and ies .  the motif of the rcc <dig> abc-ie 

sequences matching motifs from both ie <dig> and ie <dig> were omitted 



while the vast majority of d-ie are intronic and oriented in the same direction as the gene containing them,  <dig> intronic ies appear to be on the opposite strand. seven of these were complete d-ie . additionally,  <dig> complete and  <dig> partial ie  appear to be intergenic . some d-ie overlapped coding  or noncoding  exons, most of which  were located on the opposite strand. the majority  were d-ie <dig> partials that only contained motif  <dig>  suggesting possible integration into the cds. motif  <dig> does not encompass branch points, and is therefore unlikely to function as an independent intron. these deviations may also represent lingering issues with gene models or potentially other aspects of micromonas ie dynamics and their proposed propagation at r-loops  <cit> . overall,  <dig>  d-ie  are located in  <dig>  introns of the new model set, 90 % of which are supported by spliced transcript data. although  <dig> of these introns contain two or three ie , most ie containing introns have a single complete d-ie <dig> 

presence of d-ies  is connected to higher percentages of gc splice donors, 79 % of which occur in d-ie1-containing introns. still, 54 % of d-ie <dig> have gt splice donors, indicating that selection may act against the gc splice donor. only 15 % of introns containing complete d-ie <dig> have gc splice donors, while introns that contain a full d-ie <dig> have gc splice donors 46 % of the time. interestingly, sequence proximal to d-ie splice donors is much more conserved than for rsis, regardless of gc or gt donor state .

we applied the same analysis approach to evaluate abc-ies in rcc <dig>  <cit> . one hundred sixty four abc-ies were identified, less than the  <dig> reported elsewhere  <cit> . unlike d-ies, a single highly conserved motif captured these sequences, all of which were intronic. the ies further differ from the abundant families in ccmp <dig> because they are on average shorter  than rsis , more akin to introner-like elements in fungi  <cit> . overall, our results demonstrate that d-ie are an order of magnitude more abundant than repetitive introns reported in genomes of other species, in particular fungi  and rcc <dig>  <cit> .

micromonas proteome comparisons and designation of a new species
protein families in the two genome-sequenced micromonas were compared using two approaches. previous studies have performed global analyses on niche differentiation between the two micromonas  <cit>  and other mamiellophyceae  <cit>  using best blast approaches. here, orthomcl analysis  <cit>  showed that a total of  <dig>  predicted protein families were present in both ccmp <dig> and rcc <dig>  encompassing  <dig>  and  <dig>  proteins, respectively . forty additional families  and  <dig>  ‘singleton’ proteins were present in ccmp <dig> only. eighty-six families  and  <dig>  singletons were present in rcc <dig> only. we minimized the probability of grouping proteins inaccurately  in this analysis by requiring that at least 60 % of the length of the shorter protein overlap with the longer pair member. however, this approach could result in missed orthologs. therefore, we also used a lenient reciprocal best blastp hit approach , which identified  <dig>  putative orthologs. thus, on average 19 %  to 36 %  of predicted proteins can be considered present in one micromonas but not the other, depending on the method used. one gene family expansion in ccmp <dig> relative to rcc <dig> involved slr proteins. eighty-four are present in ccmp <dig>  compared to nine in rcc <dig>  slr proteins are widespread in eukaryotes and bacteria, typically have low similarity levels, and are involved in a wide range of processes, including cellular stress, regulation of mitosis, and assembly of membrane-bound protein complexes  <cit> . the significant expansion in m. pusilla  provides an example of expansion that may relate to basic biological differences between these two isolates.fig.  <dig> core, shared, and unique protein-encoding gene families. values indicate the total number of protein families  and in parentheses the gene count contained within those families for  m. commoda rcc <dig> and m. pusilla ccmp <dig>  unique singleton genes are not represented in this panel, and only one representative was kept for identical paralogs in ccmp <dig>  and rcc <dig> . b comparison of rcc <dig>  ccmp <dig>  and transcriptome-based ccmp <dig> protein sequences. numbers in parentheses are genes for which no paralog was identified. c comparison of micromonas , dolichomastix tenuilepis, bathycoccus prasinos, and ostreococcus . note that an individual gene family in outer lobes can be composed of two or more predicted proteins from one species



collectively, the differences observed here and in prior studies  <cit>  clearly support clade a  and clade d  as being different species. therefore, here we name rcc <dig> micromonas commoda based on molecular diagnoses and the protocols of the international code of nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants. the species name refers to the fact that rcc <dig> is easy to grow in an axenic state in the laboratory. this naming will avoid confusion in the literature  <cit>  where clade a strains such as rcc <dig> or its close relatives  are incorrectly termed micromonas pusilla.

comparative genomics of marine green algae
we also compared micromonas with other class ii prasinophytes using predicted proteomes from either genomes or rna-seq transcriptome assemblies. first, we compared the proteomes predicted for m. pusilla ccmp <dig> and m. commoda rcc <dig> to a protein set predicted from the ccmp <dig> transcriptome  <cit> , which represents the polar micromonas clade e <dig>  <cit> . after removing duplicates from the transcriptome assembly, a total of  <dig>  ccmp <dig> proteins were analyzed, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  amino acids . the relative overabundance of short proteins indicates that the transcriptome-based gene assemblies were often incomplete.

orthomcl was used to create core, shared and unique protein families between ccmp <dig>  rcc <dig>  and ccmp <dig> . ‘unique’ features in transcriptome-based predicted proteomes can only be determined if the respective proteins are absent from genome-sequenced taxa, but not the reverse: absence from a transcriptome-based proteome can reflect either absence from the genome, or lack of transcription at the time of sampling. a total of  <dig>  families were shared between micromonas clades a, d and e <dig> . an additional  <dig>  families were shared by ccmp <dig> and rcc <dig>  possibly reflecting incomplete coverage of the ccmp <dig> proteome. ccmp <dig> and rcc <dig> shared  <dig> gene families not present in ccmp <dig>  and  <dig> gene families were exclusive to ccmp <dig> and ccmp <dig>  this suggests ccmp <dig> is somewhat less diverged from rcc <dig> than from ccmp <dig>  at least in terms of gene content.

ccmp <dig> contained putative paralogs absent from ccmp <dig> and rcc <dig>  one group contained three genes encoding one or more discoidin domains . the transcripts from these are divergent, making it unlikely that they represent alternative spliceoforms of a single gene. none of the proteins have predicted transmembrane domains or signal peptides, but the protein predictions do not start with methionine and are likely to be 5′ incomplete. discoidin proteins are involved in binding of cell-surface attached carbohydrates and are present in eukaryotes and prokaryotes  <cit> . a recent publication proposed that ccmp <dig> is capable of phagotrophy  <cit> , in which case it seems possible that these proteins may function in substrate recognition. absence of these domains in the other micromonas clades analyzed would then be consistent with the fact that only photoautotrophic growth has been observed for the clade a and d isolates.

the number of “unique” genes and families in each micromonas clade is extensive and raises questions on similarity levels between orthologs shared between two or more clades. on average, amino acid identity between micromonas orthologs was low, for example when  <dig>  reciprocal best blast hits  were aligned between ccmp <dig> and rcc <dig>  on average only 60 % of amino acid residues were identical over the length of the alignment . average coverage was 78 %, based on the fraction of aligned regions in the shorter sequence. results were similar for orthologs shared between ccmp <dig> and rcc <dig> and those shared between ccmp <dig> and ccmp <dig>  in contrast, the  <dig>  orthomcl-identified orthologs in o. lucimarinus and ostreococcus sp. rcc <dig> averaged  <dig> % identity and 93 % coverage. comparison of o. lucimarinus and ccmp <dig> orthologs  showed 54 % identity with 83 % average overlap. this makes ortholog coverage between o. lucimarinus and ccmp <dig> higher than between rcc <dig> and ccmp <dig>  while further investigation is necessary, these results suggest there may be less evolutionary divergence between core genes shared by the most basal micromonas   <cit>  and its sister group ostreococcus , than with the more derived micromonas clades a and e <dig> table  <dig> ortholog similarities among prasinophytes with sequenced genomes

the gene fraction represents the ortholog count divided by the total number of predicted proteins in the smaller member of the pair 



scaled or naked
to understand differentiation between scaled and naked prasinophytes as well as other genus level differences, four additional proteome sets were created and compared. the first three sets comprised  all micromonas ,  all ostreococcus  and  the predicted proteome from the b. prasinos genome  <cit> . the fourth set contained just a predicted proteome  of the more basal class ii prasinophyte dolichomastix tenuilepis . members of the dolichomastix genus are motile  <cit>  and are present in the arctic and temperate oceans  <cit> . the four class ii prasinophyte genera shared  <dig>  of  <dig>  protein families . d. tenuilepis caused the largest reduction in core numbers and, when excluded, the class ii prasinophyte core is just 9 % smaller than the micromonas core set . the d. tenuilepis protein set consisted of  <dig>  unique proteins, of which 25 % were between  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids long . in contrast, only 2 % of ccmp <dig> and rcc <dig> protein predictions are < <dig> amino acids, with the smallest being  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, respectively. this suggests issues with the predicted d. tenuilepis proteome arising from library construction, rna sequencing or assembly methods  <cit> . alternatively, incomplete protein predictions might have caused issues connected to orthomcl criteria on protein overlap. hence, a conservative estimate of the class ii prasinophyte core excludes d. tenuilepis, resulting in  <dig>  shared families .

both bathycoccus and dolichomastix form scales  <cit>  as do nearly all prasinophytes described to date  <cit> , making their absence in micromonas and ostreococcus unusual. the biosynthetic pathway for scale formation is unknown  <cit> , but four gene families have been reported as expanded in b. prasinos, compared to other genome-sequenced class ii prasinophytes: sialyltransferases, sialidases , ankyrin-repeat proteins, and zinc finger proteins  <cit> . here, of  <dig> gene families shared between b. prasinos and d. tenuilepis that were not found in the other sequenced genera,  <dig> were sialyltransferases , and  <dig> were neuraminidases . the sialyltransferase families contained  <dig> b. prasinos and  <dig> d. tenuilepis proteins and the total number in these organisms was even higher,  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. sialyltransferases were otherwise found only in m. commoda and o. rcc <dig> , making these genes reasonable candidates for investigation of scale formation.

about half of the  <dig> b. prasinos and  <dig> d. tenuilepis neuraminidases belonged to families shared between the two species, but none were shared with naked prasinophytes. no neuraminidases were found in rcc <dig>  o. tauri, and o. rcc <dig>  one neuraminidase was present in ccmp <dig>  o. lucimarinus contained four other neuraminidases. blastp of the b. prasinos proteins against the ncbi nr database revealed just single neuraminidase proteins in the trebouxiophyceae chlorella variabilis, coccomyxa subellipsoidea c- <dig>  auxenochlorella protothecoides, and helicosporidium sp. atcc  <dig>  hence, these proteins provide a second example of enrichment that is potentially related to scale formation.

another protein present only in b. prasinos and d. tenuilepis was a golgi-targeted xyloglucan fucosyltransferase. xyloglucan is a hemicellulose that makes up ~20 % of the primary cell wall of vascular plants  <cit> . other enzymes for xyloglucan synthesis such as xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase/hydrolase  and β1 → 4-glucan synthase are present in charophyte algae  <cit> , but not in b. prasinos or the d. tenuilepis transcriptome. a. thaliana fucosyltransferase  <dig>  has been shown to fucosylate xyloglucan and at least two of the remaining nine atfut proteins appear to have some function in cell wall formation  <cit> , suggestive of a possible role of fut in wall or scale formation in these prasinophytes. in contrast to prior genome-based studies on scale formation  <cit> , we did not find enrichment of ankyrin repeats or zinc fingers in the families shared only between the scaled taxa. many zinc finger and ankyrin repeat genes were found in micromonas  and ostreococcus . the majority of these were in families present in all the prasinophytes analyzed.

when the class ii prasinophyte proteomes were analyzed together, 19 %  of the  <dig>  protein families identified were exclusive to micromonas . this is higher than the fraction of proteins unique to the three ostreococcus , which represent three of the four ostreococcus clades  <cit> , b. prasinos , and d. tenuilepis . for the latter two, inclusion of genomes or transcriptomes from other members of the genus might expand the observed values. these results highlight the greater gene diversification within the micromonas genus compared to ostreococcus and likely more extensive genome reduction prior to divergence within the ostreococcus genus.

each genome sequenced class ii prasinophyte genus has low redundancy within protein families. among the families identified here, only 4 % of those that contain ccmp <dig> proteins have more than one ccmp <dig> protein . the same is true for rcc <dig>  b. prasinos, o. tauri, and o. lucimarinus while o. rcc <dig> shows even less expansion . low gene family expansion makes these organisms strong candidates for future experimental work on protein function.

the viridiplantae ancestor
presence/absence patterns between prasinophyte protein families provide insights into the evolution of the viridiplantae as a whole. this is true at the level of individual protein families, biosynthesis pathways  <cit>  and the ancestral suite of photosynthesis-related machinery. one such protein is phytochrome, a master regulator in plants that is present in m. pusilla and d. tenuilepis, but not in m. commoda, the m. sp. ccmp <dig> transcriptome, ostreococcus, bathycoccus or chlorophyte algae. the prasinophyte phytochromes share conserved signaling mechanisms with land plants but detect shorter wavelengths  <cit> . here, the ‘unique’ overlap of families containing micromonas representatives and other class ii prasinophytes was greatest with dolichomastix . our analysis identified multiple enzymes involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis  in protein families shared by d. tenuilepis and two of three micromonas species .fig.  <dig> peptidoglycan biosynthesis. a proteins involved in the peptidoglycan biosynthetic pathway and final crosslinking steps . b peptidoglycan pathway proteins in the archaeplastida, showing mure, ddl, mray and murg are present throughout the viridiplantae. the full pg pathway complement with the exception of pbp occurs in several major plant lineages. the final column indicates the gene for plant peptidoglycan associated streptophyte protein  identified herein, a putative assignment based on its exclusive presence in plants with the complete or nearly complete pg-pathway



peptidoglycan  formation involves ten core enzymes, seven of which participate in the conversion of udp-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine  to glcnac-n-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide-pyrophosphoryl-undecaprenol  <cit>  . in bacteria, including cyanobacteria, this compound is transferred to the periplasm by murg and mray, and multiple linear strands are then cross-linked by penicillin-binding proteins  to form the 3-dimensional structure of the cell wall pg layer  <cit> . glaucophyte algae, which also belong to the archaeplastida , maintain the pg-wall of the cyanobacterial endosymbiont around their chloroplast  <cit> . however, pg has not been observed in plastids of other archaeplastida groups and is presumed lost, resulting in modifications of the mechanisms for chloroplast division or wall formation that are not understood  <cit> . in the vascular plant a. thaliana, only four pg pathway genes remain: mure, mray, murg, and ddl  <cit>  . indeed, among streptophytes, the complete set of enzymes has only been reported in p. patens  <cit>  and selaginella moellendorffii , a non-seed species that belongs to the oldest extant vascular plant division  <cit> . a pg-layer has not been observed in chloroplasts of these taxa.

we identified complete pg pathways in m. pusilla, m. sp. ccmp <dig>  and prasinophytes from class iii and vii . most genes are also present in the d. tenuilepis transcriptome. in contrast, m. commoda has only mure, mray, murg and pbp, and the three ostreococcus as well as bathycoccus only contain ddl and mure . two of these enzymes  were reported previously in rcc <dig>   <cit> . chlorophyte algae also have only a few pg-pathway genes and show differences between coccomyxa subellipsoidea versus c. reinhardtii and volvox carteri . a pg layer has not been observed around the chloroplast of micromonas  or other prasinophytes, at least by conventional transmission electron microscopy imaging. the gene patterns observed here with expanded taxon sampling illustrate differences in the pg-pathway ranging from complete retention  to differential pg-pathway losses between some micromonas species, other class ii prasinophytes and chlorophyte algae . these findings led us to investigate pg biosynthesis in a broader sampling of archaeplastida lineages.

we characterized pg pathway gene complements in the viridiplantae by searching protein families in the phytozome database, version  <dig>  <cit> . the mosses physcomitrella patens, sphagnum fallax, and selaginella moellendorffii contained the complete pathway, including pbp, as expected based on prior literature on p. patens  <cit> . each gene in the pathway was represented by a single phytozome gene family, except pbp, which was not represented . surprisingly, we also identified a full complement of pg pathway genes except pbp in taxa distributed throughout the streptophytes . most of these protein sequences are derived from automated gene predictions, therefore we verified expression using the predicted protein sequence as a tblastn query against est databases . evidence for expression was found for all genes, although not necessarily from all species . representative orthologs of each pg pathway protein have predicted chloroplast transit peptides  and atmure has been shown to localize to the plastid, where it is thought to function in chloroplast biogenesis  <cit> .

for the vascular seed plants that did not contain the full pathway , four genes were usually present: mure , mray  and murg , as well as ddl . this four-gene subset encodes enzymes that function in the second half of the pg-biosynthesis pathway. interestingly, ddl creates the d-alanyl-d-alanine dipeptide that is linked to the murnac tripeptide by murf , but murf itself is not part of the subset, suggesting an as yet unrecognized functional equivalent may exist.

unlike the patchiness seen across the viridiplantae, none of the relevant enzymes are harbored in available red algal genomes, while all are present in the glaucophyte gloeochaete wittrockiana . the latter finding corresponds well with the detection of a pg-wall in glaucophyte chloroplasts as well as several enzymes involved in the pg-pathway  <cit> . collectively, our results indicate that members of several prasinophyte classes represent a more ancestral archaeplastidal state than a variety of land plants, the more reduced class ii prasinophytes  and chlorophyte algae. moreover, rather than a very limited presence within the viridiplantae  <cit> , the majority of the pg pathway has been retained throughout plant evolution and selective losses have occurred in multiple independent events .

penicillin inhibits pbp activity in bacteria and fosfomycin acts earlier in the pg-pathway, on mura  <cit> . we performed exploratory experiments on micromonas using these antibiotics. m. pusilla grew slower than m. commoda in our experiments . controls followed the expected  <cit>  increase in chlorophyll-derived red fluorescence  and forward angle light scatter  that occurs during the light period, and their reduction as division begins at night fall . the only significant change from controls occurred at the 8 h time point in m. pusilla, where red was lower  in the penicillin treatment than the control and this reduction appeared to persist in subsequent timepoints. other differences were not significant  in part due to the low power of duplicates in statistical analyses. nevertheless, general trends throughout the time course were identified. cell division appeared to cease in the m. pusilla penicillin treatment based on the growth rate  and, independently, the lack of reduction in fals . these results are suggestive of an active role for pbp in m. pusilla and are consistent with experiments on other archaeplastida that contain pbp. in glaucophytes including gloeochaete, antibiotics cause cessation of chloroplast division and loss of pigments   <cit> . in p. patens antibiotic treatment results in fewer chloroplasts and development of macrochloroplasts  <cit> . in knockout experiments on p. patens mure and pbp, a macrochloroplast phenotype is observed in the former and inhibition of division in the latter  <cit> . thus, the pg-pathway has been proposed to function in chloroplast division in glaucophytes and moss. additional experiments with greater replication as well as visualization with chemical-fixation free electron microscopy are important next steps to test our hypothesis that the pg-pathway has similar roles in multiple prasinophyte lineages.fig.  <dig> antibiotic treatments in exploratory experiments on m. pusilla and m. commoda. treatments with 10 mm fosfomycin and penicillin show changes between the penicillin treatment and control at each time point but, apart from the 8 h time point , these differences are not significant . antibiotics were added 1 h after lights on  to cultures acclimated to a 14 h light/10 h dark cycle. thus, 14 h was 1 h after lights off and the 18 h timepoint was 5 h into the dark period. a growth rate of ccmp <dig> and rcc <dig> in controls and treatments. chlorophyll-derived red fluorescence in b ccmp <dig> and  rcc <dig> normalized to bead standards. forward angle light scatter , an indicator of cell size in  ccmp <dig> and  rcc <dig> normalized to bead standards. error bars reflect the standard deviation of biological duplicates



we also investigated whether plant species with the complete pg biosynthesis pathway  share other genes that are absent from the reduced pg-pathway taxa. to this end, we searched phytozome for shared families that are absent from organisms with just the 4-gene pg subset. phytozome gene family # <dig> matched these criteria, all but one of its  <dig> members  contain a c-terminal lysm domain . seventeen members also have a conserved n-terminal  <dig> amino acid domain  that is almost entirely hydrophobic and is predicted to form an alpha-helical transmembrane region, with the lysm domain on the outside. in bacteria, the lysm domain binds peptidoglycan  <cit> . in plants, lysm domain-containing proteins are thought to be involved in sensing bacterial peptidoglycan  <cit>  and chitin  <cit>  by recognizing n-acetylglucosamine moieties  <cit> . when we performed additional motif searches against phytozome using the transmembrane and lysm motifs together, we found the bi-domain protein in all embryophytes that contained the pg synthesis pathway, regardless of pbp status . most of these taxa have one or two orthologs and the mosses sphagnum fallax and p. patens have three. we named this bi-domain protein “peptidoglycan pathway associated streptophyte protein ” because it was not detected in the ncbi nr database  or in the glaucophyte and prasinophytes studied here. phylogenetic analyses of mure , mura and ppasp showed branching patterns that follow known relationships among plants . the presence/absence patterns of pbp and ppasp across the archaeplastida suggest that ppasp evolved or was acquired around the time that streptophytes diverged from the ancestor shared with chlorophyte and prasinophyte algae. ppasp would then have been differentially lost in taxa from multiple plant lineages, alongside other pg-pathway components.

the discovery of several vascular plant lineages containing most of the pg-pathway, and presence of the shared four-gene pg-subset in others, is suggestive of selective retention and implies a cellular function. the proteins necessary for transmembrane transport and synthesis of the lipid intermediates  are present in all plants. we speculate that plants with the full pg pathway  synthesize the pg lipid intermediate, which is then localized between the inner and outer chloroplast membranes. ppasp does not appear to contain a transit peptide, but could be inserted into the outer chloroplast membrane to interact with the n-acetylglucosamine moieties of the pentapeptide . if the ppasp innovation in terrestrial plants is connected to the pg-pathway it may serve as an alternative modality to pg-formation  by incorporating pathway intermediates into as yet uncharacterized components of the plastid wall. our findings raise new questions regarding the pg-pathway role in extant plants and prasinophytes by highlighting complexity in retention of cyanobacterial machinery that likely influences chloroplast division or wall structure.

the core of photosynthesis
one approach to understanding photosynthesis and plant evolution has been identification of nucleus-encoded proteins shared across the viridiplantae  and other photosynthetic lineages but absent from non-photosynthetic organisms. to this end, the “greencut”  <cit>  and subsequently the “greencut2”  <cit>  were created, the latter using genomes from  <dig> taxa including diatoms, a red alga, chlorophyte algae , prasinophyte algae , moss, spike moss and several seed plants. the greencut <dig> provides the results as  <dig> c. reinhardtii proteins and their  <dig> orthologs in a. thaliana . micromonas was not used for generation of the greencut <dig>  but a survey was performed using the a. thaliana greencut <dig> orthologs against ccmp <dig> and the authors concluded that ~10 %  of greencut <dig> proteins were missing from m. pusilla  <cit> .

we used orthomcl to group c. reinhardtii and a. thaliana greencut <dig> proteins. this resulted in  <dig> families containing  <dig> and  <dig> of their proteins, respectively. four reported greencut <dig> proteins  were removed because they did not cluster using our criteria of 30 % overlap  and blastp e-value ≤10− <dig>  cgl <dig> has been identified as a potential false positive previously  <cit> . of  <dig> greencut <dig> families,  <dig>  and  <dig>  were detected in m. commoda and m. pusilla respectively . of those missing, none were in existing chloroplast genome data and five were absent from both genome-sequenced micromonas species. however, one of these five was present in m. sp. ccmp <dig>  two in d. tenuilepis, and the other two in ostreococcus . o. lucimarinus and o. rcc <dig> protein sets contained  <dig> and  <dig> greencut <dig> families, respectively, and  <dig> were present in b. prasinos. these losses were proposed to represent specialization to life in the marine environment  <cit> . however, the ostreococcus and bathycoccus genomes are also known to be highly reduced. our collective analyses show that  <dig>  % of our greencut <dig> proteins  are present in marine prasinophytes. a single family  emerged from the greencut <dig> set as being unique to terrestrial green lineage organisms, a putative nickel/cobalt transporter present in chlorophytes and land plants .fig.  <dig> the greencut can be divided in ancestral, core and land specific sets. a proteins with unknown functions , known functions  and predicted functions  are depicted based on  <cit> . ‘other’ refers to a domain or motif suggesting a general function but not a specific functional category. b cellular location of a. thaliana protein families in the ancestral and core  sets based on targetp analysis. mixed: members of an ortholog group show different targeting signals. c functional categories of core and ancestral genes  <cit> , showing that proteins involved in pigment synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and cofactors are all maintained in the core set and do not appear to have undergone differential losses



the core set of nucleus encoded proteins present in prasinophytes, chlorophytes and streptophytes  gives insight into the essence of photosynthesis in the viridiplantae, its control by the eukaryotic host that endosymbiosed a cyanobacterium and the composition of the green algal progenitor. therefore, we created an ancestral greencut <dig>  that is based on greencut <dig> proteins found in any prasinophyte  as well as in chlorophytes and streptophytes  . proteins differentially ‘missing’ from prasinophytes provide information on features that may relate to adaptation to life on land or merely the extreme genome reduction in ostreococcus and bathycoccus. indeed, a protein set essential to photosynthetic processes should have orthologs in all relevant taxa. we identified these proteins by removing any families that were missing in one or more genome-sequenced taxa and termed them the “core greencut2” . signal peptides targeting the chloroplast are predicted on the majority of a. thaliana proteins in the ancestral  and core  protein families . the m. pusilla and m. commoda ortholog groups show  <dig> %  and 53 %  chloroplast targeting for these sets. the percentage of micromonas proteins with consistent targetp-based localization predictions was lower than for arabidopsis, resulting in the lower percentages assigned to the chloroplast-targeted category . among the core set were all cgreencut <dig> proteins with assigned functions in pigment, carbohydrate metabolism and cofactor synthesis . these results emphasize that a more reduced set comprising  <dig> cgreencut <dig> protein families  are critical to photosynthesis in the green lineage.

CONCLUSIONS
the plant lineage as a whole contributes hugely to the uptake of atmospheric co <dig> and food resources in the ocean and land. our studies reveal a high level of diversity in class ii prasinophytes. micromonas pusilla  and micromonas commoda  have large differences in their genomic organization, each having repetitive intron families  not present in the other  <cit> , and ccmp <dig> alone having a high fraction of gc splice donors. protein families are often not shared between these and/or with other class ii prasinophytes such as the polar micromonas species and particularly ostreococcus and bathycoccus, the more diminutive genome-sequenced genera. our comparative genome analyses provide candidate genes for future studies on structural and niche defining aspects of these taxa. perhaps most surprising is that two of the three micromonas species analyzed, as well as d. tenuilepis, have the complete peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway, including the penicillin binding protein responsible for the final crosslinking step. likewise, in multiple land plants and other prasinophyte algae this pathway is maintained nearly in its entirety , although previously known only in p. patens and largely lacking in a. thaliana and other plants. together with the greencut <dig>  agreencut <dig> and cgreencut <dig> protein sets, our evidence-based comparative analyses provide a springboard for investigation of key aspects of photosynthesis, requirements for plant adaptation to a terrestrial environment and adaptive processes in marine green algae.
