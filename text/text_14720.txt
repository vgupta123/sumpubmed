BACKGROUND
early in the 1980s, enterodiol  and enterolactone  were first detected in the serum, urine and bile of humans and several animals  <cit> . they were classified as phytoestrogens due to their origins from plants and their estrogenic as well as antiestrogenic activities in humans. epidemiologic and pharmacologic studies have shown that end and particularly its oxidation product enl have preventive effects on osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, hyperlipemia, breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer and menopausal syndrome  <cit> . unlike other plant-derived lignans, they are also known as mammalian lignan or enterolignan, because they are mainly found in mammals. numerous studies have indicated that end and enl can be produced from several plants, such as flaxseed, by bacteria in the intestinal tract of humans and animals. thompson et al. tested  <dig> common plant foods and found that flaxseed flour and its defatted meal produced the highest yield of end and enl in vitro, up to  <dig> times higher than that from others  <cit> .

flaxseed is the dried seed of linum usitatissimum l., which is widely distributed in northern china, with an annual output of  <dig>  tons . the important precursors of end and enl synthesis include secoisolariciresinol diglucoside , secoisolariciresinol , matairesinol , lariciresinol  and pinoresinol   <cit> . among these precursors, sdg is the most abundant lignan in flaxseed, with a content of around  <dig> - <dig>  mg g- <dig>  in whole flaxseeds, and  <dig> - <dig>  mg g- <dig>  in the defatted flour  <cit> .

although de novo synthesis of end and enl has been reported  <cit> , the processes of synthesis are very complex and expensive, requiring more than ten major steps. more importantly, the reagents used in the reactions for the synthesis include lialh <dig>  meoh and several other chemicals, which are toxic and harmful to the environment. therefore, biotransformation of precursors in plants to end or enl is highly desirable.

biotransformation of sdg to end and enl by human intestinal bacteria has been extensively studied, the pathway consisting of glycoside hydrolysis, demethylation, and dehydroxylation of sdg and its intermediates  <cit> . bacteria that can produce end and enl on plant lignans under strictly anaerobic conditions have been isolated from human feces  <cit>  . however, sufficient yields for marketing scale production of end and enl by these microbes have not been achieved, largely due to the difficulty to create and maintain the strictly anaerobic culture conditions under which the bacteria can grow and conduct the biotransformation.

in china, flaxseeds are mainly used as oil crop. the defatted waste, though a rich source of lignans, is mostly used as animal feed. to establish a method for producing enterolignans from defatted flaxseeds by bacterial biotransformation, we screened human fecal samples and obtained cultures that can efficiently produce end. after  <dig> rounds of selection by successive subcultures of human fecal bacterial microbiota in media containing defatted flaxseeds as the only carbon source, we obtained a group of mixed bacteria that could metabolize flaxseeds to produce end under both anaerobic and aerobic culture conditions. in this paper, we report the method and discuss its potential applications for large scale production of enterolignans.

RESULTS
determining culture media for bacterial production of end from defatted flaxseeds
to select the human intestinal bacteria that could efficiently metabolize flaxseed lignans to produce end without the need of strictly anaerobic culture conditions, we compared three types of culture media .

when the cultures were terminated, end could be detected in media a and b, but not c, with the yield of end in medium b being considerably higher than that in medium a . these results indicated that a nitrogen source  was necessary to support the bacteria that could transform flaxseed lignans into end. based on these results, we chose medium b for bacterial cultures.

optimization of culture conditions for large-scale production of end
for large-scale production of end, we increased the volume of medium b from  <dig> ml to  <dig> liter with  <dig> g defatted flaxseeds in  <dig> liter erlenmeyer flasks. in one of the erlenmeyer flasks,  <dig> ml liquid paraffin was added on top of the culture medium; in another erlenmeyer flask, no liquid paraffin was added, for comparison of effects of anaerobic vs aerobic culture conditions on end production. the culture was continued at 37°c for  <dig> days and then terminated for analysis of end production. interestingly, cultures with or without liquid paraffin added on top of the culture had similar yields of end and the concentration of end reached  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg l- <dig> in both cases, demonstrating that biotransformation of flaxseed lignans into end in our system did not require strict anaerobic conditions.

enrichment of end
we treated the cultures  with  <dig> fold volumes of 95% ethanol to terminate the culture and to precipitate the macromolecule substances in the culture. we then evaporated the supernatant at 50°c under reduced pressure and retrieved a ca.  <dig> g pellet from a  <dig> liter culture. we dissolved the pellet in  <dig> ml of 5% ethanol, chromatographed the solution on  <dig> g of xad- <dig> macroporous resin column, and successively eluted the column with  <dig>  liter of 5%-50% ethanol solutions, with 5% ethanol concentration gradient increases. each elute was analyzed by hplc. as shown in fig.  <dig>  end was mainly eluted by 40% ethanol; the end production could reach up to  <dig>  mg g- <dig>  the produced end was identified as -end with reference to the published data ;  <cit> ).

selection of end-producing bacteria by successive subcultures
in the first few passages, there was a great diversity of microbes in the culture as examined by gram staining and pfge analysis . starting with passage  <dig> , the microbial diversity became gradually reduced. end- <dig> was the last passage that could still produce end, although the product took a longer time to appear  and the yield was also significantly decreased . when end- <dig> was diluted for further passages, end was hardly detected. therefore, we speculated that end- <dig> contained the minimal number of bacterial members that would be necessary to cooperate in producing end.

pulsed field gel electrophoresis  analysis of end-49
a  <dig>  ml aliquot of the end- <dig> culture was spread on an lb plate and well isolated single colonies were picked up the following day. we then took  <dig> colonies with seemingly different morphologies and isolated genomic dna from them for pfge analysis. based on their similarities of pfge patterns with spei cleavage, we categorized the  <dig> bacterial strains into five distinct groups , with group i containing as many as  <dig> of the  <dig> strains . the remaining  <dig> strains were categorized into four groups .

phylogenetic characterization of group i strains
the dominance of group i strains in the minimal bacterial consortium that was still capable of producing end from defatted flaxseeds suggests that this bacterial lineage might be the main player in the biotransformation to produce end. to assess their roles in this biochemical process, we randomly picked seven group i colonies , grew them on defatted flaxseeds and analyzed the culture for the presence of end. no end was detected from any of the seven group i strains. instead, we detected seco, a key intermediate in the transformation of flaxseed lignans  to end , from all seven tested group i strains. after one day of incubation, seco concentration was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg l - <dig>  when the incubation continued, the maximum concentration reached  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg l- <dig>  no end or seco was detected from the group ii-v strains. we initiated genomic analysis of these bacteria, beginning with s <dig> through s <dig>  using the endonuclease i-ceui, which reflects phylogenetic relationships among bacteria  <cit> . all seven strains had indistinguishable i-ceui cleavage patterns after pfge , and this pattern is very similar to bacteria in the genus klebsiella  <cit> ; no difference in cleavage pattern by spei, xbai or avrii was seen either among the seven strains . comparisons of 16s rrna sequence of s <dig> with those of sequenced bacterial genomes in genbank revealed close phylogenetic relatedness of s <dig> to klebsiella strains; the 16s rrna sequence has been deposited to genbank with the accession number of gq <dig>  genomic analysis is under way to determine the identity and relative abundance of all members in end- <dig> 

discussion
the likely health values of enterolignans and, on the other hand, difficulties in its large scale industrial production at low cost and without environmental pollution call for biotransformation technologies to convert plant lignans to them. numerous bacterial isolates that can conduct the biotransformation have been reported  <cit> . however, most of the reported bacteria require strict anaerobic conditions to grow and metabolize plant lignans to produce enterolignans, which significantly restricts large scale production. here in this study, we report highly efficient production of end from defatted flaxseeds through biotransformation by human intestinal bacteria without having to culture the bacteria under anaerobic conditions. the method described here has four advantages. first, instead of pure lignans , defatted flaxseed flour was used as the substrate for end production. as flaxseeds are widely available around the world and the defatted by-products of flaxseeds are usually used as animal feeds or even treated as waste, our study provides a very economic and eco-friendly method of end production using these low cost materials. second, the high efficiency of end production by our bacterial culture system without the need of strictly anaerobic conditions makes large scale production much easier. third, no extra carbon source would be needed in the culture, which is especially advantageous, because the most energy-efficient carbon sources, e.g., glucose, normally repress the utilization of other energy sources by microorganisms. therefore, in the absence of common carbon sources, the biotransformation of flaxseeds into end would be remarkably enhanced. fourth, this method is entirely harmless to the environment, as the solvents used in this procedure were only water and ethanol, both of which could be recycled.

in this study, a bacterial consortium, end- <dig>  was obtained from human intestinal microbiota through successive subcultures. end- <dig> was highly efficient in converting flaxseed lignans into end, producing up to  <dig>  mg g- <dig>  much higher than previously reported  <dig>  mg g- <dig> . end- <dig> consists of at least five genomically different bacterial lineages as estimated on the basis of pfge analysis. as none of the single-colony isolated bacterial strains could produce end, we postulate that the biotransformation was conducted jointly by several different bacteria, including some or all the pfge-resolved group i-v strains and possibly some bacteria that escaped detection in this study. the next-generation sequencing technologies  may eventually help identify the end-producers by determining the whole genome sequences of all bacteria in the consortium and facilitate the elucidation of the pathways of end production by these bacteria.

end and enl have two enantiomeric mirror image forms, which can be inter-converted by intestinal bacteria. in our study, end produced by "end-49" was -form, consistent with the published work  <cit>  in which sdg from flaxseed was transformed to -enl via -seco. additionally, researchers have confirmed that the absolute configurations at c- <dig> and c- <dig> of end and enl were not changed during the microbial metabolism  <cit> . therefore, obviously, in our study, sdg was converted to -end by human intestinal microbiota via -seco as a metabolic intermediate.

the method described in this study had been optimized and could be used to obtain bacterial consortia that can convert plant lignans into end or related products. using this method, we screened fecal specimens from  <dig> young adults and detected end or its dehydrogenized product in all cases , consistent with previous reports that bacteria that can convert plant lignans into end or related products are common members of the human intestinal microbiota  <cit>  and they are readily obtainable for use in the bio-production of end.

CONCLUSIONS
biotransformation is a very economic, efficient and environmentally friendly way of mass-producing enterodiol from defatted flaxseeds.
