BACKGROUND
leaf senescence is a major physiological process that affects vegetative and productive developmental processes in plants, and delayed senescence can prolong the leaf life span and increase seed yield  <cit> . in the leaf senescence process, leaves lose their chloroplasts, convert the photosynthetic products into carbohydrates, and transport them into sink organs, such as seeds  <cit> . the conversion from leaf maturation to senescence is complex and associated with changes in genome-wide gene expression levels and several senescence-associated genes  have been discovered in many plant species  <cit> . approximately  <dig>  sags were identification from  <dig> species and ~ <dig>  % were found in arabidopsis thaliana. additionally, over  <dig> transcription factors, such as nam, ataf, and cuc , as well as wrky, squamosa promoter-binding protein , apetala <dig> , and myb, are involved in leaf senescence regulation .

the phytohormone response pathway is important in the leaf senescence regulatory network. cytokinin and auxin  can delay leaf senescence, while ethylene, abscisic acid , jasmonic acid , and salicylic acid  can promote leaf senescence  <cit> . recently, molecular mechanisms involved in the control of leaf senescence by phytohormones have attracted attention. nac members are transcription factors involved in plant leaf senescence  <cit> . nac <dig> was induced by ethylene insensitive <dig> , which could improve leaf senescence in arabidopsis. aux is an negative regulatory factor in leaf senescence, while auxin response factor transcription factors could bind to the promoters of the aux genes and regulate their expression levels  <cit> . additionally, aba, ja, sa, and brassinosteroids are involved in regulating plant development and senescence .

plant mirnas are small non-coding rnas, 21-nucleotide  in length, which play critical roles in the regulation of their target genes by cleaving target transcripts at the post-transcriptional level  <cit> . mir <dig> participates in the leaf senescence feed-forward pathway, together with ein <dig> and oresara <dig>   <cit> . recently, chlorophyll catabolic genes  and acs <dig>  were found to be involved in this feed-forward loop  <cit> . both ein <dig> and ore <dig> could directly bind to the promoters of the ccgs and activate gene expression during ethylene-mediated chlorophyll degradation. mir <dig> is a senescence-associated mirna that represses the onset of senescence. five teosinte branched/cycloidea/pcf  transcription factors were regulated by mir <dig> and function in leaf developmental regulation . meanwhile, tcps directly regulate lipoxygenase  <dig> , which encodes a key enzyme of ja biosynthesis, and a high level of mir <dig> leads to delayed leaf senescence in arabidopsis  <cit> . additionally, other mirnas and their targets, for example, osa-mir <dig>  osa-mir160/mir <dig>  osa-mir <dig> and osa-mir <dig>  targeting mrnas coding for myb/tcp, auxin response factor, salicylic acid-induced protein  <dig>  and ap <dig> proteins, respectively, were also found to be involved in leaf senescence through phytohormone signaling pathways in rice  <cit> .

hybrid maize has a long active photosynthetic period that is mainly achieved by having a higher chlorophyll content during senescence, or by maintaining a higher photosynthetic activity level during chlorophyll loss, which increases grain yield. in this study, two inbred lines with distinct leaf senescence characteristics, early leaf senescence, in the namesake early leaf senescence- <dig> , and stay-green, delay-in-leaf-senescence, in the elite inbred line yu87- <dig>  were selected as the materials to determine the potential roles of mirnas and their target genes in leaf senescence, and to explore the network between them. the information will increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of leaf senescence.fig.  <dig> leaves and chlorophyll content over the course of leaf senescence developmet. a phenotypes of maize ear leaves at different days after pollination . each sample was selected randomly from uniform plants. representative plants were photographed to show the progressive yellowing process of leaves over the lifespan. b chlorophyll content in the leaves of inbred lines els- <dig> and 87- <dig>  the chlorophyll contents decreased with age in both materials but at different rates. the data were derived from triplicate experiments with the standard deviation plotted. chit, total chlorophyll content. bars represent mean ± se, n ≥  <dig> *, p <  <dig> ;**, p <  <dig> ;***, p <  <dig> 



RESULTS
characterization of leaf senescence in two inbred lines
to characterize the senescence behavior of els- <dig> and yu87- <dig>  the phenotypes of ear leaves at 10dap, 20dap, 25dap, and 30dap were observed in the field. the leaves of the two lines all remained green and had the same performance from  <dig> to  <dig> dap. however, the leaves of inbred line esl- <dig> lost their green color during the 20– <dig> dap period, while the leaves of inbred line yu87- <dig> stayed green during this stage . after  <dig> dap, the inbred line esl- <dig> had already lost most of its leaf chlorophyll, while the top sections inbred line yu87- <dig> leaves had just turned yellow.

interestingly, in the inbred line, els- <dig> yellowing occurred faster on the top part of the leaves than in the middle and base parts from  <dig> to 30dap. the chlorophyll a content sharply dropped from  <dig> mg/l at 25dap to  <dig>  mg/l at 30dap in the leaves of the inbred line els- <dig>  while only a slight reduction of chlorophyll a, from  <dig>  mg/l to  <dig>  mg/l, was observed in the leaves of inbred line yu87- <dig> during the same time period. the change in the chlorophyll b content was different from that of chlorophyll a. in the leaves of inbred line els- <dig>  chlorophyll b decreased faster and earlier than chlorophyll a . a reduction, from  <dig>  mg/l to  <dig>  mg/l, of chlorophyll b was detected at 20dap in els- <dig>  the total chlorophyll content decreased in both inbred lines with age, and the variation trend was more acute in the leaves of inbred line els- <dig> than in yu87- <dig> from  <dig> to 30dap. the phenotypes and the chlorophyll data showed that the leaf senescence of inbred line els- <dig> was earlier than the normal inbred line yu87- <dig> 

deep sequencing of small rnas and their population distributions
four small rna pools for the ear leaves collected at  <dig> and  <dig> dap from the inbred lines els- <dig> and yu87- <dig> were sequenced using the illumina deep-sequencing technique to identify mirnas involved in leaf senescence. in total,  <dig> , <dig> reads were obtained from the four samples. after eliminating the other non-coding rnas  and aligning the clean reads to the maize b <dig> genome ,  <dig>  candidate mirna reads remained, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  reads, with  <dig> . <dig> average reads per timepoint . in all four samples, the 24-nt rnas were the most abundant and more than half of the srna ranged in length from  <dig> to 24nt .fig.  <dig> length distribution and abundance of srnas in the samples. the 24-nt rnas were the most abundant and more than half of the srnas ranged in length from  <dig> to 24nt . mirnas were 21–22nt, while sirnas were 24nt



known and novel mirna identification during leaf senescence
the expression levels of mirnas at  <dig> and  <dig> dap in the inbred lines els- <dig> and yu87- <dig> were analyzed and compared using the reads data from the deep sequencing. after filtering out inferior reads ,  <dig> mirnas belonging to  <dig> mirna families were identified . the expression patterns of  <dig> mirnas were consistent between els- <dig> and yu87- <dig> from  <dig> to 30dap, with  <dig> mirnas up-regulated and  <dig> mirnas down-regulated. the other  <dig> mirnas were expressed differently in the two inbred lines.

according to the analysis of the un-annotated small rnas,  <dig> novel candidate mirna loci were identified . the majority of newly identified mirnas were 20-23nt in length , matching the size of the canonical mirnas processed by dicer-like proteins.table  <dig> novel mirnas abundance identified by small rna libraries



differential expression of mirnas between the two inbred lines
to investigate the mirnas involved in leaf senescence from  <dig> to 30dap, the expression profiles of mirnas at  <dig> and 30dap in the leaves of inbred line els- <dig> were analyzed. the stay-green line yu87- <dig> was also analyzed as the control. the mirnas in the leaves of the inbred line els- <dig> with expression levels, in log2-fold changes, were greater than  <dig>  or less than − <dig> , were considered potentially differentially expressed mirnas that might participate in leaf senescence. among those identified in the leaves of inbred line els- <dig>  differentially expressed mirnas whose |log2-fold change| was > <dig>  in the leaves of inbred line yu87- <dig> were removed, and  <dig> candidate mirnas were finally identified in the leaves of inbred line els- <dig>  these  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas, belonging to nine mirna families, zma-mir <dig>  zma-mir <dig>  zma-mir <dig>  zma-mir <dig>  zma-mir <dig>  zma-mir <dig>  zma-mir <dig>  zma-mir <dig>  and zma-mir <dig>  were selected as candidate sa-mirnas . among them, zma-mir <dig>  zma-mir <dig> and zma-mir <dig> were down-regulated in both inbred lines, while zma-mir <dig>  zma-mir <dig>  zma-mir <dig>  zma-mir <dig>  and zma-mir <dig> were up-regulated in both inbred lines between  <dig> and 30dap.fig.  <dig> expression levels of senescence-associated mirnas in the leaves of inbred lines els- <dig> and yu87- <dig>  in total,  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas were identified as candidate sa-mirnas. red indicates up-regulated gene expression and blue represents down-regulated. the scale is log <dig> 



validation of mirna expression profiling in leaf senescence
to validate the sequencing results and the mirna expression patterns, the expression profiles of eight sa-mirnas were validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  . the differential expression levels of mirnas from  <dig> to  <dig> dap had similar trends by deep sequencing compared with the results of qrt-pcr.fig.  <dig>

based on the profiles, almost all of the mirnas were down-regulated in the ear leaves of the inbred line els- <dig>  except mir <dig> and mir <dig>  which had high expression levels on 30dap and mir <dig>  which had a low expression level on 10dap. as for inbred line yu87- <dig>  the mirna expression trend was more complex. among the candidate mirnas, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> were up-regulated from  <dig> to 30dap, and mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> were down-regulated from  <dig> to 30dap.

among the target genes profiled in the ear leaves of the inbred line els- <dig>  the gene expression trends were opposite those of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  suggesting that these mirna target genes were subjected to a negative regulation by the mirnas, most likely through a target cleavage pathway. in contrast, the expression trends of mir <dig> and mir <dig> were not opposite those of their target genes. a specific mirna may have multiple targets and their expression levels may be subjected to transcriptional regulations, in addition to the post-transcriptional regulations by mirnas. similarly, the expression trends of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> were negatively correlated with those of their target genes in the inbred line yu87- <dig>  while the expression levels of mir <dig> and mir <dig> were positively correlated with their target genes. therefore, the effects of mirnas and their targets were complicated and not always directly negatively correlated, as normally predicted.

target genes of mirnas identified by degradome sequencing
to find the potential target genes for the different mirnas, a genome-wide degradome sequencing analysis was performed using high-throughput degradome sequencing technology . based on an analysis using the blastx algorithm, the targets of the candidate mirnas were detected in the degradome libraries, and most of them, such as the sbp and myb transcription factors, leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinases , ap2-like factor, zinc finger proteins, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e <dig> and beta-galactosidase, were involved in aging. a functional analysis indicated that  <dig> % of the target genes were classified as transcriptional regulators and  <dig> % were translational regulators . additionally,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the genes were classified as metabolizes, signal transducers, and stress responders, respectively.fig.  <dig> functional classifications of the mirnas’ target genes



discussion
maize is a major food and energy crop for human consumption, stock feed, and bioenergy production. as an integral part of plant development, leaf senescence involves a whole-plant senescence process in which minerals and carbohydrates are mobilized and translocated to the storage organs from the vegetative plant parts  <cit> . early leaf senescence caused by intrinsic or environmental factors results in a photosynthetic decline and precocious whole-plant aging  <cit> . because the relationship between senescence and crop productivity is complex  <cit> , and hybrid maize plants always have a short grain-filling period, early leaf senescence seriously affects grain yields. in the leaf senescence process, the most obvious phenotypic characteristic was leaf yellowing, which results from the preferential breakdown of chlorophyll and chloroplasts  <cit> . compared with the inbred line yu87- <dig>  the inbred line esl- <dig> showed a faster decline in chlorophyll a and b levels at 25dap and later, which is similar to the levels seen in lines in which pollination is prevented  <cit> , indicating that the source/sink ratio might cause the leaf senescence in the inbred line esl- <dig> 

previous research considered leaf senescence as a complicated and highly regulated developmental process, and many sags were identified in arabidopsis, wheat, rice, and maize  <cit> . in addition to the sags, several other genetic regulatory mechanisms involved in leaf senescence have been identified. the mirna pathway was the last mechanism that was discovered to be responsible for leaf senescence and its regulatory network. mir <dig> and mir <dig> were identified to target ore <dig> and tcp transcription factors, and both are negative regulators of leaf aging . in this study, 16mirnas were identified as being differentially expressed between the early leaf senescence line els- <dig> and the normal green-stayed inbred line yu87- <dig>  the target genes of the leaf sa-mirnas were identified by degradome sequencing and categorized as being involved in transcriptional regulation and other biological processes.

the receptor-like kinases  are cell surface receptors, and most plant rlks have extracellular receptor, single-pass transmembrane, and intracellular kinase domains  <cit> . several rlks are involved in a diverse range of developmental and stress signal transduction pathways, such as brassica srk in self-incompatibility  <cit>  and rice xa <dig> in resistance to bacterial pathogens  <cit> . the transcription levels of pvsark in bean and atsiak in arabidopsis increased in senescent leaves  <cit> . the rlpk <dig> gene, cloned in an artificially induced senescent soybean mutant, encodes a lrr-rlk protein  <cit> . the rna interference-mediated knock down of rlpk <dig> dramatically retarded both the natural and nutrient deficiency-induced leaf senescence in transgenic soybean, and its leaves showed higher chlorophyll contents and a deeper green color. these results indicated that lrr-rlks might be involved in the regulation of chloroplast development and chlorophyll accumulation. in the present study, two differentially expressed mirnas, zma-mir167d and zma-mir171a, which were predicted to target genes encoding lrr-rlks protein, were identified as down-regulated in the leaves of inbred lines els- <dig> and yu87- <dig>  at the late stage of leaf development , the expression levels of zma-mir167d and zma-mir171a were higher in the leaves of the inbred line els- <dig> than in yu87- <dig>  higher levels of zma-mir167d and zma-mir171a might decrease the expression of lrr-rlks, which was predicted to promote leaf senescence.

transcription factors often act as switches causing differential gene expression levels by binding to specific cis elements in the promoters of the target genes, which results in their activation and/or suppression. using a leaf senescence est library, guo  <cit>  collected ~ <dig> senescence-associated transcription factors, which belonged to the nac, wrky, ap <dig>  myb, zinc finger proteins, and bzip families. ap <dig> is involved in fruit ripening and plant senescence regulation in an ethylene/aba-dependent way  <cit> . osa-mir172a, osa-mir172c, and osa-mir172d were identified as targeting genes of ap2-like factors in the leaves of rice  <cit> . high levels of osa-mir172a, osa-mir172c, and osa-mir172d depressed the expression levels of ap2-like factor genes, which retarded leaf senescence. in correlation to this study, the expression levels of zma-mir172c in the leaves of the inbred line els- <dig> were lower than in the inbred line yu87- <dig> during the late stage of leaf development . additionally, zma-mir172c negatively regulated its target genes, which encoded ap <dig> proteins, as identified through degradome sequencing . based on the phenotypes of els- <dig> and yu87- <dig> observed in this study, we concluded that mirna-mediated leaf senescence, as an additional mechanism, exists in maize.

myb genes were first identified as oncogenes derived from retroviruses in animal cells that encoded transcription factor proteins and shared the conserved myb dna-binding domain  <cit> . in plants, myb proteins are divided into four classes depending on the number of myb dna-binding repeats: myb-related, r2r3-myb, r1r2r3-myb, and atypical myb family  <cit> . in the past decade, many researchers have focused on the roles of myb transcription factors in growth control, hormone signaling, and stress response, and a few studies implicated myb transcription factors in the regulation of leaf senescence. mybh- <dig>  a mybh mutant line, exhibits a delayed-senescence phenotype, while over expressing mybh causes premature leaf senescence and enhances the expression of leaf senescence marker genes  <cit> . the aux-responsive phenotype is enhanced in mybh overexpression lines and was reduced in a mybh knockout line, suggesting that mybh mediated leaf senescence by aux homeostasis. the ectopic expression of a myb-related transcription factor, atmybl, triggered early leaf senescence in a. thaliana  <cit> . guo and gan  <cit>  found that atmyb <dig> regulates whole-plant senescence by inhibiting cytokinin-mediated branching during the late stages of arabidopsis development. in the present study, zma-mir159d was identified as a differentially expressed mirna, which was predicted to target genes encoding the myb transcription factor by degradome sequencing. the expression level of zma-mir159d was down-regulated in the leaves of the inbred line els- <dig>  while it had a higher expression level in the leaves of the inbred line yu87- <dig> during the 25-30dap . the different expression profiles might be one of the reasons for the rapid decrease in the chlorophyll content that induced the earlier leaf senescence in the inbred line els- <dig> 

the gene ontology of the sa-mirnas target genes, identified by degradome sequencing, have been analyzed. unlike the major targets of the conserved mirnas, which were mainly involved in transcriptional and translational regulation, the target genes of sa-mirnas had distinct functions. in the present study, the newly predicted mirnas, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  were characterized as targeting the gene transcripts encoding psba and 30s ribosomal proteins for regulation. psba encodes a photosystem q  protein involved in the photosynthetic electron transport in photosystem ii, and leaf senescence was promoted in tobacco homoplasmic psba deletion mutants  <cit> . ribosomal proteins in plants regulate cell growth and death  <cit> . individual ribosomal proteins, and changes in their expression levels, participate in and modulate a wide variety of activities associated with cell growth and death. the 30s ribosomal protein was identified via a proteome study in maize leaves and was characterized as a nitrogen-related senescence protein  <cit> . combined with the tissue-specific expression model and the target specificity, it is highly possible that the novel mirnas were transiently and spatially expressed to fulfill the special functions needed.

in this study, six mirnas regulating nodes, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  pre-mir <dig>  and pre-mir <dig>  were highlighted as key regulators of leaf senescence because of their differential expression profiles between els- <dig> and yu87- <dig>  and a candidate mirna-dependent leaf senescence pathway was established based on the differentially expressed mirnas and their potential functions discussed . the mirnas associated with leaf senescence in this study mainly functioned through three pathways: plant hormone regulation, chlorophyll metabolism, and energy metabolism. even though the mechanisms underlying these pathways and their effects on leaf senescence are not clean, our data provide valuable information for understanding the roles of mirnas in leaf senescence regulation.fig.  <dig> the mirna-dependent gene expression network. the mirna-dependent leaf senescence pathway was obtained based on the differential expression levels and their potential functions. green indicates up-regulation with leaf senescence and red indicates down-regulation



CONCLUSIONS
the inbred line els- <dig> in maize is an early leaf-senescence line with rapidly declining chlorophyll a and b levels at 25dap and later. using deep rna-sequencing and degradome sequencing,  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas were identified between the two inbred lines in this study. these differentially expressed mirnas were candidate sa-mirnas with potential roles in the leaf senescence regulatory network. mirna analyses indicated that these sa-mirnas mainly targeted the sbp and myb transcription factors, lrr-rlks, ap2-like factor, zinc finger proteins, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e <dig>  and beta-galactosidase. their targets were speculated to regulate leaf senescence mainly by controlling chlorophyll degradation and transcription factor-mediated phytohormone pathways.
