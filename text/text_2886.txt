BACKGROUND
the modular structure of biochemical reaction networks greatly facilitates the systematic investigation of their design principles  <cit> . in this way it is often possible to identify small functional units called network motifs  <cit>  which convey a particular functionality. a thorough understanding of the relationship between network design and functionality is not only important for a smart modification and regulation of existing networks, but it is also essential to design novel circuits with prescribed functionality  <cit> .

regulatory properties of cellular networks arise from an interplay between positive and/or negative feedback reactions. these feedback reactions can be effective at the transcriptional level, at the posttranslational level or through allosteric interactions. for example, in transcriptional networks feed forward loops can act as a low pass filter  <cit>  or as a fold-change detector  <cit>  depending on the sign of the genetic interactions. signal transduction cascades often utilize post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles to generate ultrasensitivity  <cit>  or bistability  <cit> . this behavior is advantageous for cell fate decisions where irreversible switch-like transitions are required, e.g. during maturation  <cit>  or cell-cycle progression  <cit> . metabolic enzymes are often regulated through allosteric interactions with positive and/or negative effector molecules. a classical example is the allosteric product activation of the glycolytic enzyme phospho-fructokinase  which may lead to an oscillatory behavior of the glycolytic pathway  <cit> .

so far, the relation between particular molecular reaction mechanisms and the resulting macroscopes behavior has been mainly investigated in well-mixed reaction systems where the dynamics is conveniently described by ordinary differential equations  <cit> . however, if the enzymes in reversible modification cycles are located in different cellular compartments diffusive coupling between neighboring enzyme/substrate molecules may generate steep gradients  <cit>  resulting in front-like wave propagation of phosphoproteins  <cit> . in that way spatially distributed signaling pathways may create step-like activation profiles that can affect the downstream response of the system in a threshold based manner  <cit> . hence, spatial coupling can significantly alter the macroscopic behavior of biochemical reaction systems  <cit>  and bring about new functionality to network motifs  <cit> .

in reaction-diffusion systems spiral shaped concentration waves and stationary turing patterns are among the most fascinating spatiotemporal structures. while spiral waves can occur in systems with excitable and oscillatory reaction dynamics  <cit>  turing patterns typically emerge in activator-inhibitor systems with long range inhibition  <cit> . here, we investigate the effect of different mechanisms of product activation on the generation of such reaction-diffusion patterns in an enzymatic reaction system centered around the pfk which is a central part of the glycolytic pathway. under well-stirred conditions this system exhibits oscillatory behavior in both cell free extracts  <cit>  and in living cells  <cit> , and diffusive coupling was shown to generate waves of glycolytic activity in yeast extracts  <cit> . recently, we have observed a novel type of spiral wave behavior in that system  <cit> . by increasing the overall protein concentration of the extract a transition from outward to inward rotating spiral waves  was induced. while outward propagating waves have been observed in several biological systems  <cit>  inward rotating spiral waves were, so far, only observed in purely chemical systems  <cit> .

although we could reproduce the inward propagating waves in numerical simulations with the goldbeter model  <cit>  the underlying molecular mechanism for their generation is still unclear. the simulations have shown that the negative feedback on the pfk activity, as provided by its substrate atp, is not required to generate anti-waves. therefore, we focus here on the allosteric activation of the pfk by its product adp. specifically, we address the question whether the symmetry model of monod, wyman and changeux   <cit> , as employed in the goldbeter model, is necessary to generate inward propagating waves or whether a more simple hill kinetics, as it was used by sel'kov  <cit>  to model the pfk activation, is suffcient. since the regulatory properties of the pfk play a key role for the emergence of oscillatory behavior in glycolysis  <cit> , in particular in yeast extracts  <cit> , these simple models have been remarkably successful in describing general aspects of glycolytic oscillations  <cit> .

the spatio-temporal dynamics of the two pfk effectors adp and atp is described by a reaction-diffusion system of the type

  ∂tu=d∇x2u+f, u∈ℝ <dig>  p∈ℝk, 

where d is a  diffusion matrix and p denotes the kinetic parameters. the reaction mechanism is encoded in the form of the function f. due to the diffusive coupling, the analysis of wave patterns in eq.  <dig> is more complicated than the investigation of reaction mechanisms under well-mixed conditions. however, near an oscillatory instability due to a supercritical hopf bifurcation the spatiotemporal dynamics of eq.  <dig> is well described by the complex ginzburg landau equation   <cit> 

  ∂ta=∇x2a+a−|a|2a, 

whose solution types are well known  <cit> . here, the complex amplitude a describes slow spatio-temporal modulations around the unstable steady state. at the level of the cgle the details of the molecular reaction mechanism are encoded in the dependence of the two real parameters c <dig> = c <dig> and c <dig> = c <dig> on the original system parameters p and d in eq.  <dig>  to find the mapping between the two sets of parameters is tedious, but straight-forward  <cit>  . the transition between inward and outward propagating waves is marked by the curve c <dig> - c <dig> =  <dig>  <cit>  where the region c <dig> - c <dig> > <dig> corresponds to inward propagating waves in eq.  <dig> 

by explicitly calculating the two cgle coefficients c <dig> and c <dig> we show that inward propagating waves can arise in the goldbeter model due to the sequential binding of product molecules to the allosteric enzyme as implied in the mwc mechanism. in contrast, in the limit of an in finitely large binding a finity, as implicitly assumed in the sel'kov model, the formation of inward propagating waves is sup-pressed by a turing instability. we also find a relation between enzyme cooperativity and the occurrence of inward propagating waves. however, it is not the absolute magnitude of the cooperativity which is important here , but the sensitivity of the co-operativity with respect to changes in the activator concentration. finally, we observe that the sequential activation mechanism has a stabilizing effect on the wave dynamics. together, this shows that in the presence of diffusive coupling the particular choice of a molecular mechanism can have a significant impact on the type and the stability of spatio-temporal patterns even though the dynamics under well-mixed conditions is qualitatively the same.

model definitions
sel'kov model
in the sel'kov model it is assumed that the pfk is an oligomeric enzyme which has n independent binding sites for the product adp , but only one binding site for the substrate atp   <cit> . simultaneous binding of n product molecules activates the enzyme which allows for subsequent substrate binding and conversion into product with specific rate k. hence, the sel'kov model distinguishes only three enzyme states: an inactive state  which has neither substrate nor product molecules bound and two fully activated states which can have either zero  or one  substrate molecule bound . substrate molecules are sup-plied at rate νi and product molecules are used by downstream reactions with specific rate kd. the inhibition of the pfk by atp at high atp concentrations is neglected in the sel'kov model.

under steady-state conditions for the enzyme binding reactions the local dynamics of the pfk effectors atp and adp is described by the  set of equations  <cit> 

  ddtα=v−σϕs, ddtγ=qσϕs−γ 

  ϕs=αγn1+γn 

where ϕs denotes the fractional saturation. substrate  and product  concentrations are measured in terms of the michaelis-menten constant km=/ks+ and the apparent dissociation constant for product binding kpapp=1/n. the other parameters are given by ν=νi/kmkd,  σ=ke0/kmkd and q=km/kpapp. time is measured in units of 1/kd and e <dig> denotes the total enzyme concentration.

mwc model
based on experimental evidence goldbeter proposed an alternative approach to describe the allosteric regulation of the pfk  <cit>  which utilizes the monod-wyman-changeux mechanism  <cit> . here, the free form of the oligomeric enzyme performs concerted transitions between a catalytically active  and a catalytically inactive  conformation where the allosteric constant l = k+/k- defines the equilibrium between both conformations in the absence of any ligands . the enzyme is activated by sequential binding of product molecules with dissociation constant kp= for each binding step. hence, there are n +  <dig> active enzyme forms r0m to which substrate molecules can bind to form n +  <dig> enzyme-substrate complexes r1m. each complex can release product molecules at the specific rate k.

similar as in the sel'kov model substrate molecules are supplied at rate νi and product molecules leave the system with specific rate kd such that the local dynamics of atp and adp is described by the same set of equations as in eqs.  <dig> with ϕs  being replaced by 

  ϕm=αnl+n. 

the parameters have the same meaning as in eqs.  <dig> if the apparent dissociation constant kpapp is replaced by the true dissociation constant kp .

compared with the original goldbeter model we have neglected the cooperativity with respect to substrate binding and the inhibitory effect of atp on the pfk activity . with these simplifications we treat the sel'kov and the goldbeter model on an equal footing which allows for a direct comparison between their pfk activation mechanisms. since our model retains the mwc mechanism for pfk activation as an essential part we shall call it the mwc model. we also remark that the pfk actually exhibits sigmoidal behavior with respect to its second substrate fructose-6-phosphate while it does not show any co-operativity with respect to atp  <cit> . hence, the simplifying assumption of a hyperbolic dependence of the pfk activity on atp as a substrate seems to be reasonable.

diffusion and unified description
the simplest way to incorporate diffusive coupling between the pfk effectors atp and adp is to add 'diffusion terms' in eqs.  <dig> with constant  diffusion coefficients. thereby, we neglect complications arising from allosteric interactions between the pfk effectors and the enzyme which may lead to cross-diffusion terms  and a dependence of the effective diffusion coefficients on the effector concentrations  <cit> . for a recent review of the effects of cross-diffusion on pattern formation see ref.  <cit> .

due to the structural similarity between the two expressions in eqs.  <dig> and  <dig> it is convenient to rewrite the effective pfk reaction rate in a unified form. the resulting reaction-diffusion equations read

  ∂tα=δ∇x2α+ν−σϕi 

  ∂tγ=∇x2γ+qσϕi−γϕi=αnli+n,  i=s, m 

where the parameter δ ≡ datp/dadp denotes the ratio between the effective diffusion coefficients of inhibitor and activator. length scales are measured in units of the activator diffusion length given by 1/ <dig> = 1/ <dig> 

eqs.  <dig> and  <dig> will be analyzed near a supercritical hopf bifurcation where the dynamics is well de-scribed by the cgle in eq.  <dig>  we are particularly interested in the type and the stability of the emerging patterns as we change from a sequential activation mechanism  to a hill-like activation mechanism . note that the hill mechanism leads to a factor γn in eq.  <dig> while the sequential mechanism produces a factor n. the latter results from the  summation over the intermediate enzyme states rl <dig>  ..., rln  .

transition from the mwc to the sel'kov model
given the structural similarity between the sel'kov and the mwc model it will be beneficial to investigate the relation between the two models in more detail. in particular, we expect that the mwc mechanism reduces to that of the sel'kov model as the affinity for subsequent product binding steps increases  such that the product activation becomes more and more cooperative.

to show this explicitly we note that under the rescaling kp → εkp with  <dig> < ε < <dig> the normalized activator concentration γ = adp/kp changes as γ →γ/ε and ϕm becomes ϕm : = ϕε  with

  ϕε=αnlmεn+n. 

hence, ϕε interpolates between ϕm and ϕs since ϕ <dig> ≡ ϕm and as ε →  <dig>  ϕε approaches ϕs provided that the product lm εn converges to ls =  <dig>  however, this means that in the mwc model the enzyme cooperativity, as measured by the allosteric constant lm , has to become increasingly large which is in agreement with the idea that the product activation becomes more cooperative as we change from the mwc to the sel'kov mechanism.

formally, we can describe this transition by

  limε→0ϕε=ϕs provided that limε→0lmεn= <dig>  

this relation between the mwc and the sel'kov model will be helpful when we analyze how the type and the stability of the spatio-temporal patterns changes as we change the pfk activation mechanism from the mwc to the hill type.

RESULTS
the diffusive coupling of locally oscillatory reactions as in eqs.  <dig> and  <dig> can generate different types of reaction-diffusion wave patterns which can be broadly classified into outward and inward propagating waves  <cit> . near a supercritical hopf bifurcation the transition between these wave types occurs for c <dig> -c <dig> =  <dig> . depending on the initial and/or boundary conditions these waves may appear in the form of circular or spiral shaped waves.

more complex dynamic behavior can occur near a benjamin-feir instability which is indicated by the condition  <dig> + c1c <dig> < <dig>  <cit> . in this bifurcation plane wave solutions become unstable against long wave length perturbations which may result in the occurrence of spatio-temporal chaos.

finally, when the spatial scale separation δ becomes sufficiently large the oscillatory instability may be suppressed and stationary turing patterns can emerge. the transition between wave dynamics and stationary patterns is indicated by the codimension-two turing-hopf bifurcation.

to compare the spatio-temporal dynamics of the sel'kov and the mwc model we have calculated the two cgle coefficients  and the turing-hopf curve for eqs.  <dig> and  <dig> as a function of the systems parameters li, εi, ν, q, n and δ . note that σ has been eliminated by the requirement for the system to be near the hopf bifurcation.

sequential vs. hill-like activation mechanism
to decouple the two limiting prescriptions in eq.  <dig> we study eqs.  <dig> and  <dig> first in the regime of low glycolytic flux as it is typically observed during oscillatory behavior  <cit> . this regime is characterized by the conditions αs = o and γsn≪ <dig> for the sel'kov and n ≪ l for the mwc model. here, αs and γs are the respective inhibitor and activator concentrations of the  steady state. in this approximation, the function ϕi in eq.  <dig> becomes  <cit> 

  ϕi≈1liα n, i=s, m. 

the parameter li can be absorbed into the definition of the new parameter combination σ¯=σ/li in eqs.  <dig> such that we can simply change from the mwc to the hill mechanism by decreasing ε from εm =  <dig> to εs =  <dig> .

as the affinity for the sequential binding of product molecules increases  the stability region of inward propagating waves  decreases . at ε =  <dig>  the transition curve between outward and inward propagating waves  has crossed the turing-hopf bifurcation line . thus, for ε ≤  <dig>  the transition to inward propagating waves occurs in the non-oscillatory regime where wave behavior  is suppressed in favor of stationary turing patterns. this shows that the inward propagating waves, as predicted by the cgle, are not necessarily observable at the level of the original reaction-diffusion system . since the binding of subsequent product molecules becomes more cooperative as ε →  <dig> the occurrence of inward propagating waves in the mwc model seems to be related to the sequential activation of the pfk  which exhibits less cooperativity because the binding a finity  is finite for ε =  <dig> 

wave stability and numerical simulations
for the mwc mechanism outward propagating waves are stable even if the activator diffuses faster than the inhibitor . however, as ε decreases these waves become unstable as indicated by the appearance of a benjamin-feir  instability . the bf in-stability  marks the region in parameter space where plane waves with a wave number k =  <dig> become unstable to long wave length perturbations. hence, in the region to the left of the bf curve no stable wave patterns are observable. how-ever, since even for  <dig> + c1c <dig> > <dig> waves with a finite wave number k ≠  <dig> also can become unstable  <cit>  there is typically a whole region of unstable wave behavior  where spatio-temporal chaos emerges . thus, increasing the cooperativity for the product activation steps  leads to a destabilization of the coherent wave behavior for δ ≤  <dig> 

away from the bf instability curve  outward propagating waves become stable even in the limit ε =  <dig> . as δ increases further these waves turn into stationary turing patterns . in contrast, for the sequential product activation mechanism  there is no benjamin-feir instability for typical numbers of pfk subunits n ≤  <dig>  <cit>  and sufficiently low values of the steady state activator concentration γs = νq . hence, there is no spatio-temporal chaos in that regime. instead, outward propagating waves are stable at low values of δ . as δ increases the direction of wave propagation changes from outward to inward such that anti-spirals become observable . at sufficiently large values of δ wave behavior is suppressed by a turing instability  similar as for the sel'kov model.

inward propagating waves and enzyme cooperatively
the fact that the occurrence of inward propagating waves depends on the binding a finity for sub-sequent product activation steps suggests that the strength of enzyme cooperativity might play a role in this respect. the amount of cooperativity can be conveniently quantified by an effective hill coefficient which is defined  as  <cit> nh =  where m ≡ ϕ/. for ϕ = ϕi  this quantity is explicitly given by

  nh=γεi+γnlili+n,   i=s,m. 

positive  cooperativity corresponds to values nh > <dig>  while nh =  <dig> indicates no cooperativity.

to perform the transition from the mwc to the hill mechanism when l is not necessarily large we introduce in eq.  <dig> an effective allosteric constant as leff ≡ lm εn = ε  +  <dig>  this definition ensures that leff has the correct limiting behavior as required by eq.  <dig>  i.e. leff = lm = l for ε =  <dig> and leff → ls =  <dig> as ε →  <dig>  note that the true allosteric constant lm increases as 1/εn when ε →  <dig> 

in figure  <dig> we relate the occurrence of inward propagating waves to the properties of the effective hill coefficient nh as described by eq.  <dig>  for the mwc model nh exhibits a single maximum as a function of the steady state activator concentration γs = νq . while oscillatory behavior  is observed on both sides of the maximum  of the hill curve inward propagating waves only occur to the left of it where dnh/dγs > <dig> . this behavior is independent of the particular choice of the other parameters l and q . as ε decreases the cooperativity of product activation increases as indicated by an in-crease in the maximum of the hill curve . concomitantly, the stability region of anti-spiral waves rapidly shrinks and subsequently shifts to small activator concentrations where the steep-ness of the hill curve is sufficiently large . this suggests that it is not the strength of the cooperativity per se, but the sensitivity of the hill coefficient with respect to changes in the activator concentration which determines whether inward propagating waves can occur or not. this is in agreement with the fact that for the sel'kov model, where nh=n/ is a monotonically decreasing function , the formation of inward propagating waves is suppressed .

discussion
beginning in the 1960s glycolytic oscillations have become one of the best studied biochemical oscillators both in cell-free extracts  <cit>  and in living cells  <cit> . later it was found in studies with yeast cell populations that glycolytic oscillations represent a collective phenomenon. the oscillations in individual cells are synchronized through the exchange of metabolic intermediates such as acetaldehyde  <cit>  or glucose  <cit> . at low cell densities the oscillations at the population level disappear  indicating a quorum sensing mechanism  <cit> . synchronized behavior was also observed in cell-free extracts where diffusive coupling of glycolytic enzymes can generate waves of glycolytic activity  <cit> . however, clear experimental evidence for metabolic waves in living cells remains scarce  <cit>  although mathematical modeling supports the feasability of such waves  <cit> .

recently, a novel type of wave dynamics, called inward rotating spiral waves, has been observed in cell-free yeast extracts  <cit> . such wave behavior has, so far, only been observed in purely chemical systems  <cit> . here, we have investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the generation of such anti-spiral waves in simple glycolytic model systems which focus on the allosteric activation of the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase . we have shown that in the goldbeter model inward rotating spiral waves can arise due to the sequential activation of the pfk implied in the monod-wyman-changeux mechanism  <cit> . in the limit of an in finitely large binding a finity where the pfk activation is described by a hill function, as in sel'kov model  <cit> , the capability to generate inward propagating waves is lost. this suggests that the mwc mechanism, as in figure 1b, can not be further implied. on the other hand, as we have shown earlier  <cit>  the capability to generate anti-waves is retained by the goldbeter model where the cooperativity with respect to substrate binding and the allosteric inhibition by atp are additionally taken into account. hence, the mwc model can be regarded as a 'core' mechanism for the generation of inward propagating waves for allosteric enzyme systems with product activation.

for well-mixed reaction systems a simple hill function is often employed to model cooperative behavior in a 'generic' way. near the onset of oscillations choosing a hill kinetics instead of a more complex activating function, as in the mwc model, does not lead to a qualitative change in the dynamics under well-stirred conditions. however, as we have shown, the choice of the activating function can significantly change the type and the stability of dynamic patterns in the presence of diffusive coupling. for example, the appearance of a benjamin-feir instability in the sel'kov model indicates the occurrence of spatio-temporal chaos which is mostly absent in the mwc model . this suggests that the intermediate enzyme forms in the mwc model, which are only partially saturated with product molecules, can stabilize the system dynamics against long wave length perturbations.

sel'kov and goldbeter have shown that for the pfk mediated reaction to become oscillatory a sufficiently strong positive enzyme cooperativity is required  <cit> . however, as far as oscillations are concerned the detailed shape of the hill coefficient curve  is not important. consequently, they occur on the ascending branch of the cooperativity curve  as well as on the descending branch  as long as nh > <dig> . interestingly, the occurrence of inward propagating waves does not seem to depend on the magnitude of the enzyme cooperativity, but on its sensitivity with respect to changes in the activator concentration. our simulations show that the formation of inward propagating waves correlates with a positive sensitivity  which indicates that for the pattern forming aspects of allosteric enzyme systems more subtle enzyme properties play a role than they do for the occurrence of oscillations.

since the glycolytic model systems in eqs.  <dig> and  <dig> are of the substrate-depletion type  <cit>  it is not surprising that both models predict the occurrence of stationary turing patterns if the spatial scale separation between inhibitor and activator dynamics becomes sufficiently large  <cit> . what is surprising is the fact that this transition already occurs for comparably small values of δ =  <dig>  ...,  <dig> if the number n of enzyme subunits is sufficiently large . this strong dependence on the enzyme cooperativity has been largely neglected in earlier work  <cit>  which mostly focused on the case n =  <dig> . however, in yeast the pfk is an octamer  for which turing pat-terns are predicted to occur for δ > <dig> in the mwc model and for δ > <dig> in the sel'kov model. the necessary spatial scale separation could be generated, for example, through preferential allosteric interactions of the pfk effectors with immobilized enzymes  <cit> , including the pfk itself. although turing patterns can be systematically generated only in chemical systems yet  <cit>  our results suggest that high oligomeric enzyme systems are promising candidates to generate such patterns also in properly designed biochemical reaction-diffusion systems.

CONCLUSIONS
in well-mixed reaction systems the systematic investigation of molecular reaction mechanisms has led to considerable insights into the design principles for the generation of a specific type of dynamic behavior such as bistability or oscillations  <cit> . here, we have expanded this approach to the case of spatially extended systems. specifically, we have demonstrated that amplitude equations are a valuable tool to investigate how the occurrence of particular spatio-temporal patterns depends on the details of the underlying molecular reaction mechanism in the presence of diffusive coupling. in that way we could provide a molecular explanation for the occurrence of inward rotating spiral waves as they were recently observed in glycolysis in cell-free yeast extracts. our results support the view that in yeast the allosteric enzyme phosphofructokinase is activated by a monod-wyman-changeux and not by a hill mechanism. they also highlight the importance of the number of enzyme subunits for a possible experimental generation of turing patterns in biological systems.
