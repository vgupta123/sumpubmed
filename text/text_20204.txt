BACKGROUND
podocalyxin  is an integral membrane protein originally identified by kerjaschki et al  <cit>  in the foot processes of the rat kidney glomerular podocytes. it was described as a sialoprotein of 140-kda based on its staining with alcian blue. the high sulfate content of this protein contributes in part to its heavily negative charge  <cit>  that is supposed to maintain open the interdigitations of the podocyte foot for the urine filtration. the importance of the negative charge of this protein is indicated by the loss of the structure and function of the podocytes by treatment with polycations or desialylation with neuraminidase  <cit> . null mice for podxl die soon after birth due to failure to develop foot processes in the glomerular epithelial cells  <cit> . podxl like proteins have been cloned from the rabbit, human, chicken and mouse  <cit> .

the podxl is also expressed in the luminal face of the vascular endothelia, hematopoietic cells and platelets  <cit> , among other tissues. the function of this protein in non-renal cells has not yet been elucidated. it has been suggested that it may function as a ligand for leucocyte adhesion molecule l-selectin  <cit>  due to its location in the postcapillary venules of the lymph node, high endothelial venules, and the fact that most of the l-selectin ligands in the vascular endothelium are sialomucins. thus, the podxl of the vascular endothelia may contribute to the migration of lymphocytes toward the lymph nodes.

the podxl proteins show a poorly conserved aminoterminal, extracellular, mucin-like domain containing multiple n- and o-linked glycosylation sites, a disulfide containing domain and conserved transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. the cytoplasmic tails showed the highest identities among these proteins and interaction with cytosolic proteins have been reported. based on structural similarities and their high content in sialic acid, sassetti et al  <cit>  proposed that cd <dig>  podxl and endoglycan, would form a family named the cd <dig> family of sialomucins. the three proteins are found in the vascular endothelia and also in early hematopoietic precursors, suggesting that their function may go from either cell anti-adherence, as it is the case in the renal podocytes, to selective adherence or control of cellular differentiation.

despite the interest of podxl no much is known about the transcriptional regulation of its gene in different cells. the binding of the wilms tumor suppressor factor  to conserved elements within the podxl gene promoter results in a potent transcriptional activation  <cit>  that seems to be relevant only for the induction and development of the kidney; however, a detailed analysis of the human podxl promoter  has not yet been performed. in the present study we have further characterized the 5' regulatory region of this gene. we found absence of a tata-box and a transcriptional regulation supported primarily by sp <dig> site. in addition, the role of cytosine methylation of the promoter region has been analyzed to elucidate whether this epigenetic mechanism might contribute to control the specific regulation of the expression of this gene.

RESULTS
features of the 5' flanking region of the human podocalyxin
the human podxl gene and  <dig> bps upstream of the putative start methionine was previously cloned and mapped to chromosome 7q32-q <dig> by kershaw et al  <cit> . we amplified by pcr a  <dig> bp-dna fragment of the 5' regulatory region of the human podxl gene comprising  <dig> bp from the transcription start site plus  <dig> bp of 5'-untranslated region, using the primers sense: -1297/- <dig> and antisense: 231/ <dig>  we started numbering from the transcription start site . computer analysis using the software "transcription factor binding site profile database"   <cit> , revealed a high g+c content of the proximal promoter region and a lack of ccaat and tata-like elements, a feature commonly found in the house-keeping genes. we also detected potential binding sites for the transcription factors ap <dig>  ; overlapped sp <dig> sites ; overlapped sp <dig> and ap <dig> sites , overlapped sp <dig> and nfkb sites , three gata- <dig> sites  and three wt- <dig> sites .

to determine the location of the promoter activity we studied the transcriptional activity of chimeric constructs of progressively 5'-deleted dna fragment  linked to the luciferase  reporter . the constructs were transiently transfected into tera- <dig>  hek <dig> and hepg <dig> cells, which podxl content differs considerably . figure  <dig> depicts the results obtained with the three types of cells. no significant transcriptional activity was detected with the fragment of + <dig> bp. the activity started on construct - <dig>  increasing with the length of the fragment up to - <dig>  thus, the basal promoter activity is located within the - <dig> to + <dig> bp region, whereas the upstream  <dig> bp confers maximal transcriptional activity. the extension of the 5' flanking sequence up to - <dig> diminished the promoter activity. all cells expressed similar amounts of sp <dig> .

regulatory role of sp <dig> on podxl promoter activity
the fragments up to the first  <dig> bp show a progressive increasing number of sp <dig> sites, suggesting their role in transcription. to test this possibility we transfected some of the constructs into the sp1-deficient drosophila-derived schneider's sl <dig> cells. as indicated in fig.  <dig>  no transcriptional activity could be detected when the constructs + <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> - <dig> and - <dig> were transfected into these cells; however, the transcriptional activity was initiated in all the constructs, except for the + <dig>  when the cells were cotransfected with a plasmid expressing sp <dig> . thus, the sp1sites seem to be essential to maintain a normal basal rate of transcription of podxl.

the dna/protein interactions were characterized by electrophoretic mobility of dna-protein complexes . the assays were performed with two different probes encompassing the -243/- <dig> and -538/- <dig> podxl fragments and nuclear extracts from cells with either low or high levels of podxl expression . nuclear extracts from meg0l and tera- <dig> cells formed retardation complexes with the -243/- <dig> and -538/- <dig> probes. the identity of proteins interacting at the potential binding sites was assessed using competitor oligonucleotides for ap <dig>  sp <dig>  gata- <dig> and nfÎºb sites and a non-specific unrelated oligonucleotide. ap <dig> as well as sp <dig> oligonucleotides prevented the formation of the same protein/dna complex within the -243/- <dig> probe , whereas no effect was observed  with any of the other oligonucleotides. no displacement of the emsa bands was appreciated with an antibody against ap <dig>  regardless of the type of nuclear extract used . with the -538/- <dig> probe no competition was observed with a 100-fold excess of oligonucleotides .

we ran supershift assays using nuclear extracts from meg0l cells on different probes: "a" probe includes -91/- <dig> overlapped sp <dig> sites ; "b" probe includes -146/- <dig> sp <dig> sites ; "c" probe includes -146/- <dig> and -167/- <dig> sites , and "d" probe that only includes -204/- <dig> sp <dig> site . as shown in fig. 5b, protein-dna complexes were formed with all the probes tested and at least one of the complexes was shifted by anti-sp <dig>  excepting those in which probe b were used. therefore, the binding of nuclear proteins to the sp1-c site may explain the supershifted complexes observed with "c" probe. when probes with mutated sp <dig> sites were used no supershifts were observed . similar results were obtained when tera- <dig> nuclear extracts were used . in agreement with the emsa assays, mutations in either sp1-a, sp1-c or sp1-d sites inhibited the activity of the podxl promoter by ~50%  whereas mutation of sp1-b did not .

effect of promoter cpg methylation on the cellular expression of podxl
dna methylation has been suggested to play a role in maintaining the stability of cell differentiation and in regulating gene transcription  <cit> . it has been recently reported that the selective demethylation of a promoter dna may be a general mechanism required for the reprogramming of somatic cell nuclei  <cit> . dna sequences rich in cpg are susceptible of methylation and therefore silencing the gene expression. computer analysis of the 5'-flanking region of the podxl gene with cpgplot program  <cit>  shows the existence of a putative cpg island, from - <dig> to the translation start site, containing  <dig> cpg dinucleotide sequences. the methylation of cytosines may control the transcriptional activity through changes in the binding activity of sp <dig> sites. thus, in order to elucidate the possible epigenetic regulation of podxl we analyzed the methylation status of individual promoter cpg sites in cells expressing either high  or low  levels of podxl . genomic dna of both cell lines were treated with bisulfite and then amplified by pcr with the specific primers described under methods. bisulfite changes all the unmethylated cytosines to uracils and the uracils are pcr-amplified as thymidines, whereas the methylated cytosines are not modified. as indicated in fig.  <dig>  tera- <dig> and meg0l cells showed different patterns of methylation. in high-podxl expressing cells the promoter region is unmethylated whereas in low-podxl expressing cells, meg0l cells, the promoter is partially methylated. the main difference was observed in the methylation of cpg boxes from  <dig> to  <dig> .

the role of methylation in controlling the podxl gene was also investigated studying the effects of a demethylating agent, 5'-aza-2' deoxycitidine , on the podxl expression. fig. 8a shows that 5-azac was unable to enhance the expression of podxl in hek <dig> cells. in contrast, a 5-azac-concentration-dependent increase of podxl was observed in meg0l cells. treatment with 5-azac did not modify the sp <dig> cellular content .

to further assess the influence of cpg methylation on the promoter activity of podxl, we methylated promoter fragments in vitro by sss i followed by their transfection into hek <dig> cells. fig.  <dig> shows the results of these experiments using either mock methylated or methylated - <dig> - <dig> and - <dig> constructs. the in vitro methylation of either construct by sss i almost abolished the promoter activity.

discussion
in this work we have analyzed the structure and function of the podxl gene promoter. this protein was originally described in the podocytes of the epithelial glomerular cells  <cit> . podxl is also present in extra-renal tissues, particularly in the vascular endothelial and hematopoietic cells. moreover, podxl has also been found in tumor cells  <cit>  and its expression has been considered as a good marker of mieloproliferative disorders  <cit> . the interest on podxl has been recently focused on its putative capacity to regulate the intercellular contacts.

the information about the regulation of the podxl gene is scarce. the wilms tumor suppressor factor  is a potent regulator of kidney induction and nephrogenesis  <cit>  that controls the expression of podxl  <cit> . however, the wt <dig> factor is downregulated in all tissues except in the glomerular epithelial cells where it is expressed throughout life. mutations in the wt <dig> gene are associated with glomerulosclerosis in patients of denys drash syndrome indicating the importance of this factor in the renal function in adulthood. moreover, nephrogenesis can be rescued in wtl-null mice by reintroducing the gene  <cit> . however, regulatory factors other than wt <dig> in renal or extra-renal tissues are undefined. the lack of tata or caat boxes in the podxl promoter, its high content of c+gs and the control by sp <dig> sites are typical features of house-keeping genes. the transcriptional activity of the progressive 5' deletions of this promoter indicated that its basic activity was located in the region  <dig> to - <dig> nts increasing as the length of the dna fragment increased . the progressive rise in the promoter activity directly correlates with the number of recognition sites for sp <dig>  suggesting its functional importance. this interpretation is supported by the absence of transcriptional activity of the podxl promoter constructs in insect cells  that lack sp <dig> transcription factor and the initiation of transcriptional activity by cotransfection of an expression plasmid encoding sp <dig> . despite differences in endogenous content of podxl, the activity of the podxl promoter was similar whether tera- <dig>  hepg <dig> or hek <dig> cells were used in the transfection experiments . this observation may find an explanation in the similar levels of sp <dig> factor found in these cells .

the nucleotide competition assays gave positive results for sp <dig> and ap <dig> whether nuclear extracts from tera- <dig> or from meg0l cells were used; however, no supershift was observed when monoclonal against ap <dig> was utilized . the competitive effect of ap <dig> oligonucleotide in the formation of protein-dna complexes may be related to the sequence similarities between sp <dig> and ap <dig> recognition sites. the emsa studies indicate that overlapped sp <dig> sites -167/- <dig> nts, -91/- <dig> nts and -204/- <dig> nts were able to interact with sp <dig>  since some of the formed complexes were supershifted by anti-sp <dig> ab and their formation was-prevented by mutating the recognition sites. moreover, the mutation of the sp <dig> sites reduced the transcriptional activity of podxl.

dna methylation is associated with malignant transformation  <cit>  of cells but knowledge of the epigenetic events in the initiation and progression of human cancer is limited. the abundant number of cpg islands in the podxl promoter suggested that methylation could be a regulatory factor. transcriptional repression of methylated genes may be mediated by the binding of certain proteins, such as mecp <dig>  <cit> . moreover, dna methylation may interfere with the binding of sp <dig> to dna  <cit> .

demethylation of the promoter dna may be a necessary step in the epigenetic reprogramming of somatic cell nuclei  <cit> . demethylation is a selective process, operating only on the promoter, but not on enhancers; both a putative sp1/sp <dig> and a gggaggg binding site are required for demethylation and the initiation of transcription. we analyzed whether methylation of the podxl promoter could influence its transcriptional activity: firstly, using demethylating agents in vivo and in second place by studying the state of methylation of the cpg islands in cultured cells expressing different amounts of podxl. as a demethylating agent we used 5-azac, structural analog of citidine, that inactivates methyltransferases upon its incorporation into dna with the result of activation of dna transcription. this inhibitor has been used successfully as a therapeutic agent in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome  <cit> . in our case, treatment of low podxl-expressing cells with 5-azac induced a dose-dependent increase on podxl content whereas no effects could be detected in cells, like hek <dig>  expressing higher levels of podxl. however, the reported effect of 5-azac in inducing the activity of genes in the absence of methylation of cpg islands indicates that these results should be taken cautiously  <cit> . the treatment with 5-azac may stabilize and increase the endogenous content of sp <dig>  <cit>  nevertheless in our case 5-azac did not modify sp <dig> cellular content. on the other hand, bisulfite treatment of genomic dna from high  or low  podxl-expressing cells showed a direct relationship between the degree of methylation of the promoter region and expression of podxl. the influence of the cpg methylation was further assessed by treating the promoter constructs - <dig> - <dig> and - <dig> with the methylase sss i prior to transfection into hek <dig> cells. these results add further evidence indicating that methylation may inhibit the activity of the podxl promoter.

CONCLUSIONS
the in vitro transcription of the human podxl promoter is dependent on the presence of sp <dig> sites. this conclusion is supported by the following observations: 1) no activity was detected when the promoter constructs were transfected into sp1-lacking insect cells in which the transcription was initiated by cotransfection of an sp <dig> expression plasmid; 2) the promoter function was impaired by mutation of the sp <dig> sites.

methylation of the cpg promoter islands seems to be a significant regulatory mechanism in controlling the transcription of podxl. the latter observation may provide an explanation for the different rates of podxl expression in different tissues of the organism.
