BACKGROUND
sesame , a member of the pedaliaceae, is a diploid  dicotyledon and one of the oldest oil seed crops, growing widely in tropical and subtropical areas  <cit> . sesame seeds are an important source of oil , protein , and carbohydrates   <cit> , and are traditionally consumed directly. they are used as active ingredients in antiseptics, bactericides, viricides, disinfectants, moth repellants, and antitubercular agents because they contain natural antioxidants such as sesamin and sesamolin  <cit> . among the primary edible oils, sesame oil has the highest antioxidant content  <cit>  and contains abundant fatty acids such as oleic acid , linoleic acid , palmitic acid , and stearic acid   <cit> . in addition, sesame oil is important in the food industry because of its distinct flavor. these characteristics have stimulated interest in the biochemical and physiological composition of sesame oil  <cit> .

previous studies on sesame have mainly focused on quantitative genetics  <cit> , traditional genetic breeding  <cit> , and genetic relationships and diversity among sesame germplasm collections  <cit> . although much effort has been devoted to cloning key genes and characterizing fatty acid elongation and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in sesame  <cit> , the molecular mechanisms behind fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism remain unclear. publicly available datasets are of limited use for future sesame research, such as elucidating the molecular mechanisms of specific traits and understanding the complexity of the transcriptome, gene expression regulation, and gene networks. progress in novel gene discovery and molecular breeding in sesame has been limited by the lack of genomic information. for example, only  <dig>  expressed sequence tag  sequences in sesame have been deposited in the dbest genbank database .

molecular markers play an important role in many aspects of plant breeding, such as identification of the genes responsible for desirable traits. molecular markers have been widely used to map important genes and assist with the breeding of oil crops. however, in sesame, only  <dig> genomic simple sequence repeat   <cit>  and  <dig> est-ssr  <cit>  markers have been developed. genetic relationships and diversity among germplasm collections have been investigated mostly using aflp, issr, and rapd markers. in sesame, marker-assisted selection and molecular breeding lag behind other crops owing to a lack of effective molecular markers. thus, a rapid and cost-effective approach to develop molecular markers for sesame is required. compared with other types of molecular markers, ssrs have many advantages, such as simplicity, effectiveness, abundance, hypervariability, reproducibility, codominant inheritance, and extensive genomic coverage  <cit> . based on the original sequences used to identify simple repeats, ssrs can be divided into genomic ssrs and est-ssrs. traditional methods to isolate and identify genomic ssrs are costly, labor-intensive, and time-consuming  <cit> . in addition, the interspecific transferability of genomic ssrs is limited because of either a disappearance of the repeat region or degeneration of the primer binding sites  <cit> . alternatively, est-ssrs are derived from expressed sequences, which are more evolutionary conserved than noncoding sequences; therefore, est-ssr markers have a relatively high transferability. with the increasing number of ests deposited in public databases, an expanding number of est-ssrs have been developed, and the polymorphism and transferability of est-ssrs have been evaluated in many plant species  <cit> .

the transcriptome is the complete set and quantity of transcripts in a cell at a specific developmental stage or under a physiological condition. the transcriptome provides information on gene expression, gene regulation, and amino acid content of proteins. therefore, transcriptome analysis is essential to interpret the functional elements of the genome and reveal the molecular constituents of cells and tissues. transcriptome or est sequencing is an efficient way to generate functional genomic-level data for non-model organisms. large collections of est sequences are invaluable for gene annotation and discovery  <cit> , comparative genomics  <cit> , development of molecular markers  <cit> , and population genomics studies of genetic variation associated with adaptive traits  <cit> . recently, an increasing number of est datasets have become available for model and non-model organisms, but relatively few ests are currently available for sesame.

numerous technologies have been developed to analyze and quantify the transcriptome. initially, a traditional sequencing method was used, but this approach is costly, time-consuming, and sensitive to cloning biases since it involves cdna library construction, cloning, and labor-intensive sanger sequencing. because of the deep coverage and single base-pair resolution provided by next-generation sequencing instruments, rna sequencing  is an efficient method to analyze transcriptome data. theoretically, any high-throughput sequencing technology can be used for rna-seq, such as the illumina genome analyzer, applied biosystems' solid, and roche  <dig> life sciences system. because of the increased read length by  <dig> pyrosequencing compared to the other two platforms  <cit> , the  <dig> system is usually adopted for non-model organisms to create a transcriptome database  <cit> , and a short-read-based technology such as the solexa platform has been used for resequencing  <cit> . recent algorithmic  <cit>  and experimental  advances are likely to increase the applicability of illumina sequencing and de novo assembly, which has been successfully and increasingly used for model  <cit>  and non-model organisms  <cit> . these technologies are efficient, inexpensive, and reliable for genome and transcriptome sequencing, and suitable for non-model organisms such as sesame.

in this study, we sampled the pooled transcriptomes of roots, leaves, shoot tips, flowers, and the developing seeds of sesame using illumina paired-end sequencing technology to generate a large-scale est database and develop a set of est-ssrs. to our knowledge, this study is the first to characterize the complete transcriptome of sesame by analyzing large-scale transcript sequences using an illumina paired-end sequencing strategy. these est datasets will serve as a valuable resource for novel gene discovery and marker-assisted selective breeding in sesame.

RESULTS
illumina paired-end sequencing and de novo assembly
to obtain a global overview of the sesame transcriptome and gene activity at nucleotide resolution, rna was extracted from five different sesame tissues including the roots, leaves, flowers, developing seeds, and shoot tips, and equally mixed. to minimize systematic bias from transcriptome sampling and illumina sequencing, and to enhance the accuracy of detecting low-abundance transcripts, three cdna libraries from the same pooled rna sample were constructed and sequenced separately using an illumina hiseq <dig> genome analyzer.

each sequenced sample yielded  <dig> Ã— 90-bp independent reads from either end of a cdna fragment. after stringent quality assessment and data filtering,  <dig> , <dig> reads in each library with  <dig> % q <dig> bases  were selected as high-quality reads for further analysis. using the soapdenovo assembly program  <cit> , next-generation short-read sequences in libraries  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were assembled into  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  contigs, respectively. the frequency distribution of these contigs in each library is shown in figure  <dig>  the contig length showed little difference between libraries; the average contig size was  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp, and  <dig> bp, and the median contig length  was  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp, and  <dig> bp in libraries  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.

using a paired-end sequencing strategy, contigs from the same transcript can be identified and the distances between these contigs evaluated. soapdenovo allowed us to map the reads back to the contigs, and connect the contigs into scaffolds using 'n' to represent unknown sequences between each pair of contigs. contigs in the three libraries were assembled into  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  scaffolds with average lengths of  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp, and  <dig> bp, and with median lengths of  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp, and  <dig> bp in libraries  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the distribution of scaffolds is shown in figure  <dig>  though  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of scaffolds did not show a gap in libraries  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively,  <dig>  mb,  <dig>  mb, and  <dig>  mb gaps , respectively, remained unclosed.

to further shorten the remaining gaps, paired-end reads were used to fill scaffold gaps. we gathered the paired-end reads with one end mapped on the unique contig and the other located in the gap region, and filled the small gaps within the scaffolds. sequences with the smallest number of ns and could not be extended on either end, were defined as unigenes. at this point, more than half of the gaps were filled. for example, in library  <dig>  only  <dig>  mb of gaps  remained unclosed , while in libraries  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb of gaps , respectively, remained unclosed. the de novo assembly in libraries  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> yielded  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of  <dig> bp,  <dig>  with an average length of  <dig> bp, and  <dig>  with an average length of  <dig> bp, respectively. the respective median unigene lengths in the three libraries were  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp, and  <dig> bp .

the contig, scaffold, and unigene size distributions for the three libraries were consistent , implying that the illumina sequencing solution was reproducible and reliable. therefore, unigenes from the three libraries were pooled and assembled into nonredundant unigenes for further analysis. in total,  <dig>  nonredundant unigenes with a total length of  <dig>  mb, ranging from  <dig> bp to  <dig>  bp, with an average length of  <dig> bp and a median length of  <dig> bp, were obtained. the length of  <dig>   nonredundant unigenes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp,  <dig>   ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp, and  <dig>   were more than  <dig>  bp in length .

annotation of all nonredundant unigenes
a sequence similarity search was conducted against the national center for biotechnology information , nonredundant protein  database, and swiss-prot protein database using the blastx algorithm specifying e values of less than 10- <dig>  we found that  <dig> %  consensus sequences showed homology with sequences in the nr database, while  <dig> %  unigenes had similarity to proteins in the swiss-prot database. altogether,  <dig> %  unigenes were successfully annotated in the nr or swiss-prot databases. additionally,  <dig> % of the unigenes over  <dig>  bp in length showed homologous matches, whereas only  <dig> % of the unigenes shorter than  <dig> bp showed matches . the remaining  <dig>  unigenes that had no matches in either the nr or swiss-prot databases underwent gene prediction analysis using estscan  <cit> , and  <dig>  unigenes were identified using orf prediction. in total,  <dig> %  of the putative protein-coding unigenes were detected by homology analysis using the nr and swiss-prot databases or estscan predictions.

to evaluate the quality and coverage of the assembled unigenes,  <dig>  nonredundant unigenes were submitted to a blastx search against the arabidopsis information resource , specifying an e value of less than 10- <dig>  in total,  <dig>  different arabidopsis loci were covered by  <dig>  sesame unigenes. no unigene encoding an rrna or transposable element was detected, suggesting that rrna or transposable element contamination did not occur in our database. the arabidopsis loci were located uniformly on five chromosomes . we further analyzed sesame unigenes and arabidopsis orthologs involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and found that unigenes coded for many enzymes involved in these pathways, including fatty acid biosynthesis initiation and saturated fatty acid elongation . these results demonstrated the reliability of illumina paired-end sequencing and de novo assembly.

based on nr annotation,  <dig>  unigenes were assigned gene ontology  terms. go-annotated unigenes belonged to the biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions clusters and were distributed across more than  <dig> categories, including biochemistry, metabolism, growth, development, and apoptosis . among the biological processes category, metabolic processes  was the most dominant group, followed by cellular processes , localization , and establishment of localization  . regarding molecular functions,  <dig> % of the unigenes were assigned to binding, followed by catalytic activity , transporter activity , and transcription regulator activity  . among the cellular components category, cell  and cell part  were the dominant groups, followed by organelles  and macromolecular complexes  .

in addition, all unigenes were subjected to a search against the cluster of orthologous groups  database for functional prediction and classification. overall,  <dig>  of the  <dig>  sequences showing nr hits were assigned to cog classifications . cog-annotated putative proteins were functionally classified into at least  <dig> molecular families such as cellular structure, biochemistry metabolism, molecular processing, and signal transduction . the cluster for general function prediction  represented the largest group, followed by transcription , replication, recombination and repair , posttranslational modification, protein turnover and chaperones , signal transduction mechanisms , carbohydrate transport and metabolism  and translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis , whereas only a few unigenes were assigned to nuclear structure and extracellular structure . in addition,  <dig> unigenes were assigned to lipid transport and metabolism .

reconstruction of oil accumulation metabolic pathways
according to the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database,  <dig>  unigenes were grouped into  <dig> cellular metabolic or signaling pathways including cellular growth, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, endocrine, and numerous biosynthesis metabolic pathways . being an important oil crop, previous research has focused mostly on fatty acid and lipid metabolism pathways. unigenes encode the majority of enzymes in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. specifically, unigenes encoded enzymes for the biosynthesis of oleic acid, stearic acid , and palmitic acid , the main constituents of sesame seed oil. additionally, six ests  encoded oleoyl-acp desaturase , which catalyzes polyunsaturation of oleoyl-acp  to linoleoyl-acp . since oleic and linoleic acids are the major components of sesame oil, fad <dig> is a potential biological target to modulate sesame oil composition.

frequency and distribution of est-ssrs in the sesame transcriptome
in total,  <dig>  sequences containing  <dig>  ssrs were identified from  <dig>  consensus sequences, with  <dig>  of the est sequences containing more than one ssr . the est-ssr frequency in the sesame transcriptome was  <dig> %, and the distribution density was  <dig>  per mb. the most abundant type of repeat motif was dinucleotide , followed by trinucleotide , tetranucleotide , hexanucleotide , and pentanucleotide  repeat units . the frequencies of est-ssrs with different numbers of tandem repeats were calculated and are shown in table  <dig>  ssrs with six tandem repeats  were the most common, followed by five tandem repeats , seven tandem repeats , eight tandem repeats , and >  <dig> tandem repeats . the dominant repeat motif in est-ssrs was ag/ct , followed by ac/gt , at/at , aag/ctt , and agg/cct  . however, very few cg/cg  repeats were identified in the databases.

identification of polymorphic markers
fifty primer pairs  were randomly selected from the  <dig>  microsatellites to evaluate their application and the polymorphism across  <dig> sesame accessions . forty-five of the  <dig> primer pairs successfully amplified fragments. among the  <dig> successful primer pairs,  <dig> produced pcr amplicons at the expected size and five generated pcr fragments longer than expected. the majority of the  <dig> microsatellite loci showed allelic polymorphism. the number of alleles per locus varied from four to  <dig> . the observed mean heterozygosity  was  <dig> , while the expected value  was  <dig>  . polymorphism information content  values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .

discussion
illumina paired-end sequencing
transcriptome sequencing is an important tool for expression pattern identification and gene discovery. numerous technologies have been developed to analyze and quantify the transcriptome. for example, traditional est sequencing methods, such as sanger sequencing, have made significant contributions to current genomics research and dbest database construction, but this approach is costly, time-consuming, and sensitive to cloning biases. next-generation sequencing  technologies present opportunities for plant genomic analyses with or without a complete genome sequence. because of the potential for high throughput, accuracy, and the low cost, ngs is widely applied to analyze transcriptomes qualitatively and quantitatively, and has been used successfully for de novo transcriptome sequencing and assembly in many organisms  <cit> .

only  <dig>  ests from a cdna library for developing sesame seeds  have been deposited in ncbi dbest databases  <cit> . in the present study, a transcriptome sequencing analysis of mixed rna from five sesame tissues  was conducted using the illumina platform. six gbp of data were generated and assembled into unigenes. this large number of reads with paired-end information produced much longer unigenes  than those in previous studies  <cit> . this increased transcriptome nucleotide coverage depth facilitated de novo assembly, enhanced the sequencing accuracy, and avoided possible contamination. for example, no transposable element contamination was detected in our database. the unigenes were subjected to blastx analysis against the tair version  <dig> database, and  <dig>  unigenes showed homology to  <dig>  arabidopsis genes. moreover, our database revealed that unigenes encoded for the majority of enzymes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis , suggesting that relatively short reads from illumina paired-end sequencing for a non-model organism can be effectively and accurately assembled.

in our study,  <dig> %  of the sesame unigenes had homologs in the nr or swiss-prot protein databases, whereas in epimedium sagittatum  <cit> , whitefly  <cit> , and sweet potato  <cit> , only  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % unigenes, respectively, had homologs in the nr database. the average unigene length in our database was  <dig> bp, while the length in the above three databases was  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp, and  <dig> bp, respectively. the higher percentage of hits found in our study was partially a result of the increased number of long sequences in our unigene database; the results for whitefly  <cit>  support this conclusion. homologs in other species were not found for the remaining  <dig> %  of the unique sequences. specifically,  <dig> % of unigenes shorter than  <dig> bp, and  <dig> % of unigenes longer than  <dig>  bp, showed no blast matches , which suggests that longer contigs were more likely to show blast hits in the protein databases. the shorter sequences may lack a characterized protein domain, or they may contain a known protein domain but not show sequence matches due to the short query sequence, resulting in false-negative results. additionally, only limited genomic and transcriptomic information is currently available for sesame, and consequently, many sesame lineage-specific genes might not be included in current databases.

many of the sesame unigenes were assigned to go categories and cog classifications . most representative unigenes were mapped to specific pathways, such as metabolism pathways, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, plant-pathogen interactions, the spliceosome, and starch and sucrose metabolism, using the kegg database . importantly, most of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acids were identified. unigenes without blastx hits may function as sesame-specific genes.

our results indicate that high-throughput rna-seq is an efficient, inexpensive, and reliable platform for transcriptomic analysis in non-model organisms. the large number of sequences generated in this study provides valuable sequence information at the transcriptomic level for novel gene discovery, or for the investigation of sesame molecular mechanisms.

est-ssr frequency and distribution in the sesame transcriptome
previously, genetic diversity analysis of sesame germplasm has mostly depended on aflp, issr, and rapd markers  <cit> . polymorphic ssr markers play an important role in genetic diversity research, population genetics, linkage mapping, comparative genomics, and association analysis. in the present study,  <dig>  perfect microsatellites exceeding  <dig> bp were identified from the sesame est dataset, and  <dig> % of the est sequences possessed ssrs. the ssr frequency in this study is consistent with the range of frequencies reported for other dicotyledonous species   <cit> . the est-ssr frequency is dependent on several factors such as genome structure or composition  <cit> , arithmetical method for ssr detection, and the parameters for exploration of microsatellites.

dinucleotide repeats were the most frequent ssr motif type. this finding is consistent with results reported for arabidopsis, peanut, canola, sugar beet, cabbage, soybean, sunflower, sweet potato, pea, and grape  <cit> , whereas trinucleotide repeats were the most abundant class of ssrs in cereals such as rice, wheat, and barley  <cit> . among the dinucleotide repeats, ag/ct  was the most frequent motif in our dataset, whereas cg/cg  motifs were very rare. among the trinucleotide repeats, the aag/ctt motif was common  among the microsatellites. our results are consistent with those for other plant species  <cit> . in plants, tc and ctt repeats are typically found in transcribed regions and occur at a high frequency in 5' utrs; ct microsatellites in 5' utrs may be involved in antisense transcription and play a role in gene regulation  <cit> .

est-ssr marker polymorphism
the majority of sesame est-ssrs generated high-quality amplicons, suggesting that ests are suitable for specific primer design. in this study,  <dig>  of the primer pairs designed from ests successfully yielded amplicons. among the successful primer pairs,  <dig> of the  <dig> amplicons were of the expected size. the deviation of five amplicons from the expected size may have been due to the presence of introns  <cit> , large insertions or repeat number variations, a lack of specificity, or assembly errors. the failure of five primer pairs to produce amplicons may have been caused by the location of the primer across splice sites, large introns, chimeric primer, or poor-quality sequences  <cit> . these results suggest that the assembled unigenes were of high quality and that the est-ssrs identified in our dataset could be used in the future.

using the est-ssrs in our dataset, the mean number of alleles per locus  and the mean he  and ho  were investigated across  <dig> sesame accessions. the pic values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the difference between he and ho at all loci may be the result of a very high self-pollination rate within the population. these findings indicated that polymorphism was relatively high, which is corroborated by sesame genomic ssrs  <cit> . since we identified  <dig>  ssrs in our dataset, more pcr primers could be designed in the future as tools for germplasm polymorphism assessment, quantitative trait loci mapping, and functional gene cloning in sesame.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a large est dataset composed of  <dig>  unigenes derived from the sesame transcriptome was assembled. these results indicated that illumina paired-end sequencing is a fast and cost-effective approach to novel gene discovery and molecular marker development in non-model organisms. based on the generated sequences,  <dig>  est-ssrs were identified and characterized as potential molecular markers. fifty primer pairs were randomly selected to detect polymorphism among  <dig> sesame accessions, and  <dig>  of these primer pairs successfully amplified fragments, revealing abundant polymorphism. the est-ssr markers developed in this study can be used for construction of high-resolution genetic linkage maps and to perform gene-based association analyses in sesame. to our knowledge, this is the first application of illumina paired-end sequencing technology to investigate the whole transcriptome of sesame and to assemble rna-seq reads without a reference genome. the dataset will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of fatty acid biosynthesis, lignan biosynthesis, and other biochemical processes in sesame.
