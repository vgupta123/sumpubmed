BACKGROUND
ruminal acidosis is an ongoing problem in the dairy and feedlot sectors. it has been shown to cause consistent economic losses in dairy farming, primarily due to the reduction in milk yield and milk fat, premature culling and increased losses as a result of death  <cit> . in both the beef and dairy industries, many authors  <cit>  have reported that ruminal acidosis is responsible for the onset of different pathologies, such as rumenitis, parakeratosis, metabolic acidosis, and laminitis. there are major challenges in improving the understanding of acute ruminal acidosis and subacute ruminal acidosis , including a wide range of responses observed under identical conditions  <cit>  and difficulties in measuring the ph of the rumen, which require procedures such as rumenocentesis, oesophageal intubation or rumen cannulation.

there have been many attempts to use indirect variables to predict the ruminal ph based on symptoms or blood and metabolic indicators  <cit> . however, none of the variables alone have predicted the ruminal status of cattle, and only a few of the authors attempted to model metabolic variables to evaluate ruminal acidosis  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to model the data obtained from the complete blood cell count, biochemical plasma profile, venous blood gas analysis, analysis of blood lipopolysaccharide  and lps-binding proteins  to identify a subset of variables that could reliably indicate the severity of the induced ruminal acidosis in heifers.

RESULTS
animal health and body weight
animal health was not compromised by the experiment as certified by a veterinarian at the end of each period. at the end of the trial, the heifers weighed an average of 382± <dig>  kg with an average daily gain of  <dig> ± <dig>  kg/d.

feed intake
the dry matter intake  was significantly affected by the treatment, the day, the interactions period x day and treatment x period x day . the interactions were significant because the challenge diets were provided only on the challenge day  as specified in the protocol to induce acidosis. the lowest dmi was observed following the high starch  treatment as a result of the ruminal ph drop  on the day after the d <dig>  and it could be explained as an attempt to avoid the effects of the very low ruminal ph. moreover, in the second period, the heifers that had experienced a ph below  <dig>  after ingesting the ms diet in the first period dramatically reduced their intake with the hs diet . the reluctance to consume diets rich in starch after experiencing ruminal acidosis could be explained as a memory effect due to previously experienced ruminal acidosis despite the two-week recovery period. this result depends not only on the memory effect but also on individual sensitivity to ruminal acidosis. heifers that consumed ms feed in the second period had less severe acidosis than the heifers that had fed on the same diet in the first period  and showed a lower reduction in the intake of hs feed in the third period .

 <dig> experimental periods.

a–b means within a row with different superscripts differ . α– β means within a row with different superscripts differ .

hgb = haemoglobin; hct = haematocrit; plt = platelet count; mpv = mean platelet volume; pco <dig> = partial pressure of carbon dioxide; po <dig> = partial pressure of oxygen; hco3− = bicarbonate level; o2hb = oxyhaemoglobin; rhb = reduced haemoglobin; so2m = measured oxygen saturation; chol = cholesterol; β-hb = β-hydroxybutyrate; ast = aspartate aminotransferase; γgt = γ-glutamyl transferase; lbp = lipopolysaccharide-binding protein.

the day  effect  was as follows: dmi , mean ph , max ph , hgb , total protein , glucose , chol , nefa , β-hb , ast  and lbp . the p value was >  <dig>  for the other variables tested.

the interaction p x d effect  was as follows: dmi , mean ph , nadir ph , hgb , po <dig> , glucose  and nefa . the p value was >  <dig>  for the other variables tested.

the interaction t x p x d effect  was as follows: dmi  and mean ph . the p value was >  <dig>  for the other variables tested.

ruminal ph
the regression coefficient between the ruminal ph values obtained using sensors and rumenocentesis was  <dig>  , indicating a degree of agreement between the two methods.

the control  treatment led to the highest nadir and mean ruminal ph values, whereas the lowest nadir ph level was reported for the hs treatment . in the first period, the heifers showed the lowest values of maximum, mean and nadir ph . the significant effects of the period and of the interactions treatment x period, period x day and treatment x period x day were due to the variations of dmi during the challenge day  and to individual ability to cope with the dietary factors that predispose animals to acidosis  <cit> .

to evaluate the level of ruminal acidosis, the mean amount of time per day that the ph was below three ruminal ph thresholds  was determined and is reported in figure  <dig>  the ruminal ph fell below  <dig>  during the first period for the hs and ms treatments when the animals experienced acute ruminal acidosis. the heifers feeding on ms during the first period had a ph between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the longest period of time, while the ph never dropped below  <dig>  in the heifers that were fed the ct treatment in the second and third periods. the ph varied between  <dig>  and  <dig> , ranging from at least  <dig> min per day on the ct diet during the third period to  <dig> min per day on the ms diet during the first period . the large differences in the amount of time the ph was below  <dig>  between periods were related to the dmi , individual sensitivity to acidosis and a possible memory effect in the animals that had previously experienced acidosis.

blood analysis
of the treatments, the heifers fed hs showed the highest concentrations of haemoglobin , haematocrit , platelet count  and aspartate aminotransferase . the lbp was higher in the heifers fed hs and ms, and the bicarbonate  level was the lowest in hs. the concentrations of hgb, hct, and plt were higher in the heifers that had ruminal acidosis for longer periods of time due to high ruminal osmotic pressure, which pulls fluid from plasma into the rumen and concentrates the blood components  <cit> . plt could be influenced by the onset of damage to the rumen mucosa as a result of acidosis, as reported by other authors  <cit> .

the concentration of lps in the peripheral blood plasma was below the assay detection limit of  <dig>  eu/ml for all treatments. this result was likely due to the high clearance rate of the lps in the kupfer cells of the liver, which resulted in the absence of lps in the peripheral blood and caused an inflammation cascade that led to the production of lbp  <cit> .

the higher levels of lbp in the heifers fed ms and hs were due to the high starch intake and reduction in the ruminal ph. some authors  <cit>  reported that the early hours following grain engorgement are characterised by the rapid growth of gram-negative bacteria, which undergo cell lysis and release lps following a reduction in the ruminal ph. the translocation of lps from the digestive tract to the bloodstream increases the lbp levels as a consequence of the systemic immune response  <cit> . the clearing of lps in the liver could explain the slight increase in ast, which is a non-specific liver enzyme  <cit>  that indicates liver alterations. the drop  in hco3- level represents a mechanism to contrast the incoming of metabolic acidosis as a result of ruminal acidosis  <cit> .

in this study, the period significantly affected the blood count, gas composition and the haematological profile . the first period, which was characterised by increased amount of time below the established ph thresholds , led to an increase  in hgb, hct, reduced haemoglobin  and lbp and showed a slightly higher  level of glucose. during the first period, there was a reduction  in the partial pressure of oxygen , oxyhaemoglobin , measured oxygen saturation , γ-glutamyl transferase  and a slight  decrease in β-hydroxybutyrate , whereas cholesterol  was similar to the second period and ast showed an intermediate value.

the variations in rhb, po <dig>  o2hb and so2m reflected the effects of the cellular buffering system, which represents one of the mechanisms to maintain the blood ph within a physiological range as reported in humans  <cit> . during ruminal lactic acidosis, excess organic acids that accumulate in the rumen are absorbed into the bloodstream at the risk of overwhelming the bicarbonate buffering system  <cit> . when the blood ph begins to drop in response to decreased hco3- levels, there is a shift in the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve and the red blood cells release oxygen to the tissues more readily, which increases the rhb and reduces the o2hb, po <dig> and so2m  <cit> . the slightly higher glucose level in the first period was a consequence of the increased dmi of hs and ms on d <dig> , which were rich in starch and led to a higher absorption of glucose in the small intestine. the low level of β-hb and cholesterol in the first period could be related to an altered energy status in the animals. as reported by other authors  <cit> , the high level of glucose could have lowered the β-hb concentration while the variation in cholesterol levels could be linked to interactions between many factors, including the dmi and the ruminal ph  <cit> .

the highest concentration of ast and γgt in the third period could be due to stress on the liver as a consequence of the considerable variations in dietary patterns during the experiment.

a canonical discriminant analysis  was applied to the four ruminal acidosis classes . the cda was characterised by two significant  axes, which accounted for 60% and 38% of the existing variation. among all the blood variables, hgb, mean platelet volume , β-hb, glucose and rhb contributed the most to the discriminant model . contrary to our expectations, lbp, an acute phase protein that was reported to increase during ruminal acidosis  <cit> , was not included in the model even though it was higher in ms and hs compared with ct . a possible reason is that lbp showed a different trend between d <dig> and d <dig>  compared to the ph trend, i.e., nadir ph . the variables selected in the model explain the status of dehydration , the production of new platelets in the bone marrow, which are possibly due to lesions at the ruminal level , the energy status  and the activation of the cellular buffering system to maintain the blood ph within a physiological range . although single variables cannot predict the presence and severity of ruminal acidosis due to the considerable variation in the ability of an animal to cope with a carbohydrate challenge, evaluating specific combinations of blood variables that can highlight the ongoing processes of adaptation to the ruminal stress in the animal appears to be a promising approach in diagnosing and monitoring ruminal acidosis.

hgb = haemoglobin; mpv = mean platelet volume; β-hb = β-hydroxybutyrate; rhb = reduced haemoglobin.

as reported in figure  <dig>  the scattergram relative to the total canonical structure expressing the correlation of hgb, mpv, β-hb, glucose and rhb with the canonical axes  showed good separation between the different ph classes, with the exception of the animals classified as normal  or at risk of ruminal acidosis , which were not distinguished. squared mahalanobis distances  obtained using cda between the ruminal acidosis groups showed that acute ruminal acidosis  was different from the sara  , n  and r groups . sara showed a significant separation from the r  and n  groups .

although can  <dig> and can  <dig> represent the interactions among the five variables considered, according to the raw canonical coefficients , the separation between the ruminal acidosis classes along the can  <dig> axis, which was particularly evident between n and a, appeared to be strongly related to β-hb  and glucose . the difference in these variables between the animals experiencing acute ruminal acidosis compared with the others was associated with the higher energy status of the animals fed high grain diets. the separation between the acidosis classes along the can  <dig> axis, which was higher between the a and s heifers, appeared to be related to β-hb  and mpv , which could represent an increase in platelet formation due to the onset of ruminal lesions. further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
many of the blood variables that were investigated showed significant differences between the three diets, although as few as five of them  were sufficient to obtain a canonical structure . cda appeared to significantly discriminate between the animals with a physiological ruminal status, sara or acute ruminal acidosis. despite these promising results regarding the use of plasma variables to evaluate the severity of short-term ruminal acidosis, additional studies are necessary to confirm the reliability of these discriminant functions during long periods of acidosis both in beef and dairy cattle.
