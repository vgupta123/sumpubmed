BACKGROUND
in insects, members of the cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel  superfamily mediate both fast excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the nervous system. the superfamily includes cation permeable nicotinic acetylcholine receptors   <cit> , γ-amino butyric acid -gated anion channels  <cit> , glutamate-gated chloride channels   <cit>  and histamine-gated chloride channels   <cit> . studies of drosophila melanogaster and apis mellifera have shown that cys-loop lgics mediate important aspects of behaviour such as escape response  <cit> , learning and memory  <cit> . members of the cys-loop superfamily of ionotropic receptors are also of considerable interest as they are targets of widely used insecticides  <cit> . for example, nachrs are targets of neonicotinoids  <cit> , a class of insect control chemicals which include imidacloprid with worldwide annual sales of approximately one billion us dollars  <cit> . also, gaba receptors, glucls and hiscls are targets of fipronil and avermectins  <cit> .

the red flour beetle, tribolium castaneum, is a highly sophisticated genetic and developmental model organism  <cit> , and is a major global pest of stored agricultural products. in the usa alone, t. castaneum contributes to over one billion us dollars worth of damage to wheat and corn every year  <cit> . tribolium has proven highly adaptable, developing resistance to a wide range of insecticides raising the need for the development of improved and novel control agents. to date, partial dna sequences of only a few t. castaneum cys-loop lgic subunits have been reported. these include a hiscl  <cit> , transcript variants of a nachr subunit orthologous to drosophila melanogaster dα <dig>  and a gaba-gated ion channel which is an ortholog of drosophila rdl  <cit> . interestingly, a mutation changing alanine  <dig> to serine in the tribolium gaba receptor is associated with cyclodiene resistance  <cit> . indeed, the same mutation is found in rdl from cyclodiene resistant strains of a wide range of insect species  <cit> . characterizing the full complement of tribolium cys-loop lgic subunits represents a critical step in identifying key components of the beetle nervous system as well pinpointing particular insecticide targets. here we have used sequence data from the t. castaneum genome project  <cit>  to provide the first description of a complete cys-loop lgic gene superfamily from an invertebrate pest species.

RESULTS
the t. castaneum cys-loop lgic superfamily consists of  <dig> subunit members
using tblastn  <cit> ,  <dig> candidate cys-loop lgics were identified in the t. castaneum genome and manually annotated. this is the third complete insect cys-loop lgic superfamily to be described after those of d. melanogaster and a. mellifera and the largest known to date since the fruit fly possesses  <dig> subunits and the honey bee has  <dig>  <cit> . rt-pcr  showed that all of the tribolium cys-loop lgic subunits are transcribed. an alignment of their protein sequences shows that the beetle subunits possess features common to members of the cys-loop lgic superfamily  <cit>  . these include:  an extracellular n-terminal domain containing distinct regions  that form the ligand binding site  <cit> ;  the dicysteine-loop  consisting of two disulphide bond-forming cysteines separated by  <dig> amino acid residues;  four transmembrane regions , the second of which  contributes most of the channel lining residues;  a highly variable intracellular loop between tm <dig> and tm <dig>  as with other cys-loop lgic subunits, the tribolium sequences also possess potential n-glycosylation sites in the extracellular n-terminal domain and phosphorylation sites in the tm3–tm <dig> intracellular loop.

a comparison of sequence identities between t. castaneum, d. melanogaster and a. mellifera cys-loop lgic subunits , as well as the use of a phylogenetic tree , indicates orthologous relationships between the beetle, honey bee and fruit fly subunits. to facilitate comparisons between the three species, tribolium subunits were named after their drosophila counterparts as previously done with apis subunits  <cit> . for example, the beetle orthologs of drosophila dα <dig>  rdl and cg <dig> were designated tcasα <dig>  tcas_rdl and tcas_ <dig> respectively.

tribolium nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits
we identified  <dig> candidate nachr subunit-encoding genes in the t. castaneum genome. this is the largest insect nachr gene family so far described as those of d. melanogaster, anopheles gambiae and a. mellifera consist of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> subunits respectively  <cit> . eleven of the tribolium nachr subunits possess the two adjacent cysteine residues in loop c  which are important for acetylcholine  binding  <cit> , defining them as α subunits. the remaining subunit was designated β since it lacks the vicinal cysteines.

tribolium possesses core groups of nachr subunits that are highly conserved between different insect species  <cit> . thus, subunit equivalents of dα1– <dig>  dβ <dig> and dβ <dig> are evident in the beetle genome . as with anopheles, apis and several other insects  <cit> , the tribolium ortholog of dβ <dig> is of the α type . interestingly, the beetle possesses an additional α subunit  in the dβ <dig> group, indicating a gene duplication in the tribolium lineage. in line with this, both tcasα <dig> and tcasα <dig> genes are tightly clustered together within  <dig> kb of each other in the beetle genome suggesting that both subunits arose from a recent duplication event from a common gene. both a. gambiae and d. melanogaster possess three subunits  that are very similar and show substantial homology to the vertebrate α <dig> nachr subunit  <cit> . in t. castaneum, two orthologs of these subunits  are also similar to human α <dig>  sharing 46% and 45% identity respectively at the protein level. the third subunit, tcasα <dig>  when compared with vertebrate nachr subunits, is most similar to α <dig> but shares only 25% identity and, along with its apis ortholog , departs strongly from dα <dig> . tribolium nachr subunits outside of the dα5– <dig> group show 19%–39% identity with vertebrate subunits. as is the case for dα <dig>  dα <dig>  dα <dig>  dα <dig>  dβ <dig> and their anopheles and apis orthologs, the corresponding tribolium subunits  have an insertion in loop f , which may contribute to imidacloprid interactions  <cit> . the dα <dig>  dα <dig> and dβ <dig> genes, as well as their anopheles orthologs, agamα <dig>  agamα <dig> and agamα <dig>  are similarly arranged and tightly clustered within  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb respectively  <cit> . immunohistochemical and coimmunoprecipitation studies show that dα <dig>  dα <dig> and dβ <dig> are integral components of certain nachrs subtypes, leading to the suggestion that clustering may facilitate coordinated expression and co-assembly of the nachr subunits  <cit> . in apis, amelα <dig> and amelα <dig> are clustered but are separated from the honey bee dβ <dig> ortholog, amelα <dig>  <cit> , while in the tribolium genome all equivalent beetle subunits, tcasα <dig>  tcasα <dig> and tcasα <dig>  are located on different linkage groups . the separation of these genes may thus result in diversification of receptor expression and coassembly. tribolium does however, show clustering of tcasα <dig> and tcasβ <dig>  which is conserved in the genomes of anopheles and apis but not drosophila  <cit> .

analysis of d. melanogaster, a. gambiae and a. mellifera nachr gene families has shown that each insect possesses at least one divergent subunit that shares relatively low sequence identity with other nachr subunits  <cit> . the four insect nachr gene families described so far each contain a different complement of divergent subunits. thus, drosophila and anopheles have one divergent subunit each but are of the β and α types respectively  <cit> , while apis and tribolium each have two subunits which are α and β in the honey bee and are both α subunits in the beetle  <cit>  . one of the tribolium divergent subunits, tcasα <dig>  possesses an atypical fxcc amino acid motif instead of yxcc found in loop c of all other insect α nachr subunits characterised to date . the nematode, caenorhabditis elegans, is the only other organism known to possess nachr subunits with the fxcc motif  <cit> . since site-directed mutagenesis has shown that a tyr to phe substitution in the heterologously expressed vertebrate α <dig> subunit results in a tenfold lower affinity for ach  <cit> , tcasα <dig> may have unusual ligand binding properties. in addition, tcasα <dig> lacks the gek motif characteristic of nachr subunits which precedes tm <dig>  and plays an important role in ion permeation and selectivity  <cit> . most notably, the absence of the highly conserved glutamic acid residue may have given rise to a receptor with distinct ion channel properties since a substitution of the equivalent glutamic acid residue in the vertebrate α <dig> nachr abolishes permeability to calcium ions but not monovalent cations  <cit> .

two tribolium nachr subunits, tcasα <dig> and tcasα <dig>  have alternatively spliced exons most likely arising from tandem exon duplication  <cit> . this alternative splicing is conserved in anopheles, apis and drosophila. thus, as with agamα <dig>  amelα <dig> and dα <dig>  <cit> , tcasα <dig> possesses two alternatives for exon  <dig>  , and similar to dα <dig>  <cit> , tcasα <dig> has two alternatives for exon  <dig> and three alternatives for exon  <dig> . analysis of sequence chromatograms shows that both alternatives for tcasα <dig> exon <dig> are transcribed while rt-pcr  detected all six possible combinations of alternate exons for tcasα <dig>  as previously observed for anopheles, apis and drosophila nachrs, alternative splicing introduces amino acid changes in functionally significant regions and thus is likely to increase nachr diversity  <cit> . thus, alternative splicing of tcasα <dig> exon <dig> substitutes residues in loop e, which may affect ligand binding  <cit> , as well as residues in the vicinity of the cys-loop which may affect receptor assembly  <cit> . for amelα <dig>  alternative splicing of exon  <dig> changes residues in the tm <dig> domain which may alter the ion channel properties of the receptor. in one example, tcasα <dig> exon 8c substitutes a highly conserved glutamic acid residue , which may affect ion conductance  <cit> . two tribolium alternate exons, tcasα <dig> exon 3a and tcasα <dig> exon 8b, have sequences that are identical to the equivalent exons in drosophila . also, tcasα <dig> exon 8b is completely conserved in anopheles and apis, indicating an evolutionarily robust function for this exon. as highlighted in fig.  <dig>  the other alternate exons of tcasα <dig> and tcasα <dig> have residues that differ from those of their drosophila counterparts which may give rise to nachr splice variants with functional properties particular to certain insect species.

five d. melanogaster nachr subunits  as well as rdl and glucl are known to undergo pre-mrna a-to-i editing  <cit> , a process which essentially converts adenosine  in the genome into guanosine  in transcripts, thereby generating mrna with a nucleotide sequence that differs from the corresponding genomic dna  <cit> . the cdna sequences of all the tribolium cys-loop lgic subunits were analyzed and potential rna editing was observed in two nachr subunits, tcasα <dig> and tcasβ <dig> . sequencing of the corresponding genomic dna verified that the nucleotide changes occur at the rna level. tcasβ <dig> is edited at a single site which alters a highly conserved lysine to an arginine residue in the vicinity of loop d, potentially affecting the subunit's ligand binding properties . editing at this site has not been observed for any other nachr subunits although residues nearby are edited in dβ <dig>  <cit> . tcasα <dig>  on the other hand, demonstrates a high degree of evolutionary conservation in rna editing as it undergoes editing that alters two amino acid residues as is also the case for the orthologs of d. melanogaster, a. mellifera and the tobacco budworm, heliothis virescens  <cit> . two of the editing sites in tcasα <dig> , corresponding to sites  <dig> and  <dig> in dα <dig>  <cit> , remove a potential n-glycosylation site which may affect receptor maturation, channel desensitization and conductance  <cit> . we analyzed the rna editing levels at sites 4– <dig> in rt-pcr products generated by primers that amplify specific splice variants . as shown in fig. 7c, the extent of editing varies between the three sites . for instance, editing at site  <dig> in the exon3b+exon8a , 3b8b and 3b8c splice variants is significantly higher than site  <dig> editing of the same isoforms . more strikingly, rna editing levels at the same site vary with the splice variant. for example, the 3a8c isoform has notably low editing levels at site  <dig> when compared to the other splice variants . in another case, the minority of transcripts with exon 3a is edited at site  <dig> while the majority of isoforms with exon 3b are edited at the same site . this suggests that rna-editing and alternative splicing are linked in generating proteome diversity. this is in accord with findings of a study investigating the relationship between the two processes in the drosophila dα <dig> nachr subunit  <cit> .

tribolium gaba-gated ion channels
the tribolium genome contains orthologs of the three known d. melanogaster gaba-gated ion channels, rdl, grd and lcch <dig>  <cit>  . rdl possesses a par sequence before tm <dig> which is characteristic of cys-loop ligand-gated anion channels  <cit>  while grd and lcch <dig> lack this sequence. this may underlie the findings that rdl forms homomeric anion channels  <cit>  whereas grd and lcch <dig> form heteromultimeric cation channels when expressed in xenopus laevis oocytes  <cit> . the par motif is also present in tcas_rdl and is absent in tcas_grd and tcas_lcch <dig>  indicating that tribolium may possess both ligand-gated anion and cation channels. however, whereas electrophysiology has clearly shown that gaba induces inhibitory chloride channels in insects, it remains to be established whether gaba-gated cation channels function in vivo  <cit> .

as is the case for drosophila rdl, exons  <dig> and  <dig> are alternatively spliced in tcas_rdl  although, whereas drosophila and apis have two alternatives for exon  <dig>  <cit> , tribolium has three. to accommodate this extra alternative exon and anticipate the possibility of additional exons in other insect species, we have revised the nomenclature of rdl splice variants. thus, rdl exons "a" and "b" are denoted exon 3a and exon 3b respectively, while exons "c" and "d" are now called exon 6a and exon 6b. we have designated the extra exon in tcas_rdl as exon 3c. exons 3a and 3b are completely conserved in drosophila rdl  <cit> , amel_rdl  <cit>  and tcas_rdl, while exon 3c of tribolium introduces two novel amino acid residues near to loop d . rt-pcr  show that all six possible combinations of alternate exons for tcas_rdl are transcribed. since studies of drosophila rdl demonstrate that alternative splicing alters affinity for gaba  <cit> , the extra choice of exon in tcas_rdl may give rise to a receptor with extended functional range when compared to orthologs in other insects. the most variation seen between a tcas_rdl alternate exon and its equivalent in drosophila is in exon 6a which differ by eight residues, most of which are located in the vicinity of loop f . this may give rise to receptor variants that have distinct ligand binding characteristics in the two insect species.

variants of tcas_grd were detected in rt-pcr products where differential use of splice sites introduces either one of two insertions in loop c which are denoted variant  <dig> or variant  <dig> . variations of drosophila or apis grd subunits have not so far been observed, although it has been noted that the fruit fly grd subunit has an unusual stretch of  <dig> amino acids which is present at the site equivalent to tcas_grd variants  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . since loop c is involved in ligand binding  <cit> , differential splicing has the potential to diversify the ligand binding properties of tcas_grd.

tribolium glutamate and histamine-gated chloride channels
as with d. melanogaster and a. mellifera, t. castaneum has one known glutamate-gated chloride channel  and two histamine-gated chloride channels . consistent with their putative function as anion channels, tcas_glucl, tcas_hiscl <dig> and tcas_hiscl <dig> all have the par motif preceding tm <dig>   <cit> . out of the ligand-gated anion channels, glucl and hiscl <dig> are the most highly conserved between the fruit fly and beetle, sharing 83% and 79% identity respectively .

exon  <dig> of tcas_glucl is alternatively spliced as is the case with drosophila glucl and apis glucl  <cit> . however, whereas the fruit fly and honey bee glucls each have two alternatives for exon  <dig>  tribolium has three . sequence chromatograms of tcas_glucl rt-pcr products  showed mixed peaks corresponding to exon  <dig> indicating multiple variants are transcribed. in order to maintain consistency with other cys-loop lgic subunits, we have revised the nomenclature of glucl alternative exons so that modules  <dig> and  <dig> correspond to exons 3a and 3b respectively. similar to rdl, alternative splicing of glucl alters amino acid residues in the vicinity of loop d which may introduce variation in ligand-binding properties. with the extra alternative exon , tcas_glucl may have a wider range in receptor functional properties when compared to glucls of other insect species.

tribolium phcl and uncharacterized cys-loop lgic subunits
the ph sensitive chloride channel  first identified in drosophila  <cit>  is well conserved in t. castaneum, showing 68% identity . the drosophila phcl has several splice variants, of which variant  <dig> introduces an insertion in the intracellular region between tm <dig> and tm <dig>  we detected a similar variant in tcas_phcl transcripts  where the peptide insertion differs by only one amino acid residue from that of drosophila phcl  <cit>  and is completely identical to the equivalent insertion in amel_phcl  <cit> . however, unlike drosophila and apis, the variant  <dig> insertion does not introduce a potential protein kinase c phosphorylation site in tcas_phcl. this may lead to the beetle phcl having distinct characteristics since phosphorylation of the large intracellular region modulates receptor assembly and function  <cit> , interestingly, we detected a second insertion at the same site which has not been observed in drosophila or apis. denoted tcas_phcl variant 3a , this insertion introduces a putative casein kinase ii phosphorylation site. tcas_phcl also has an insertion in loop c  which is likely to impact on ligand binding. the equivalent of this insertion has not been observed in drosophila but has been detected in apis with the insertion sequence and length differing considerably between beetle and honey bee .

five drosophila cys-loop lgic subunits have yet to be functionally characterized. these are cg <dig>  cg <dig>  cg <dig>  cg <dig> and cg <dig>  cg <dig> and cg <dig> appear to be closely related with grd and hiscls respectively while cg <dig>  cg <dig> and cg <dig> forms a distinct subfamily of cys-loop lgic subunits which, following on from a recent study  <cit> , we have denoted insect group  <dig> of cys-loop lgic subunits . tribolium also possesses five uncharacterized subunits. two of these, tcas_ <dig> and tcas_ <dig>  are candidate orthologs of cg <dig> and cg <dig> being notably similar to their drosophila counterparts, both sharing 54% identity . the remaining three subunits belong to insect group i  and have been denoted tcas_clgc <dig>  tcas_clgc <dig> and tcas_clgc <dig>  standing for cys-loop ligand gated ion channel. despite sharing highest sequence identities with drosophila insect group i subunits , their orthologous relationships are uncertain since, for example, tcas_clgc <dig> shows 36% identity with both cg <dig> and cg <dig> . a. mellifera possesses only one subunit, amel_ <dig>  in insect group  <dig>  <cit> , indicating that gene duplication occurred after the emergence of the hymenoptera to give rise to the three subunits present in both tribolium  and drosophila . this is in line with recent findings suggesting that the hymenoptera are basal to the coleoptera  <cit> . consistent with gene duplication occurring within insect group  <dig> just before the emergence of coleoptera, tcas_clgc <dig>  tcas_clgc <dig> and tcas_clgc <dig> are tightly clustered together in the tribolium genome, being located within  <dig> kb in linkage group  <dig>  in the more evolutionarily advanced d. melanogaster  <cit> , the three genes are separated with cg <dig> and cg <dig> being respectively located on the left and right arms of chromosome  <dig> and cg <dig> being present on chromosome x  <cit> .

discussion
insect genome sequencing projects have allowed the identification and comparison of gene superfamilies from diverse species. as part of the tribolium sequencing project  <cit> , we have described the beetle cys-loop lgic superfamily which encodes for receptors that play major roles in the nervous system and are also targets of highly successful insecticides. this is the first complete cys-loop lgic superfamily to be described from a coleoptera and an agricultural pest species, and is the third to be reported after those of the dipteran d. melanogaster  <cit>  and the hymenopteran a. mellifera  <cit> . in the three insect species, which represents over  <dig> million years of evolution  <cit> , the cys-loop lgic superfamily has remained compact with only minor changes in gene numbers. however, alternative splicing and rna a-to-i editing have considerably increased receptor diversity, effectively introducing changes in functionally significant and highly conserved regions to generate subunit isoforms particular to certain insect species. also, it is becoming apparent that each insect possesses a distinct complement of highly divergent nachr subunits whose sequences do not reflect a high degree of evolutionary constraint and thus may play diverse roles in different species. in addition, a group of cys-loop lgic subunits that appear to be particular to insects, which was noted as d. melanogaster group  <dig>  <cit> , and denoted here as insect group  <dig> to accommodate sequences from other species , may represent more recent members of the superfamily since only one subunit is found in apis and three are present after the emergence of coleoptera. it will be of interest to determine the functional role played by insect group  <dig> subunits and the ligands to which they respond.

the species-specific diversification arising from alternative splicing, rna editing and divergent subunits, as well as insect-specific subunits, represents promising receptor differences to target for the future rational design of insecticides that control pest species while sparing beneficial insects. the use of heterologous expression systems such as xenopus laevis oocytes has allowed the functional characterisation of several drosophila cys-loop lgics such as rdl  <cit> , grd and lcch <dig>  <cit> , glucl  <cit> , hiscl <dig> and hiscl <dig>  <cit>  and phcl  <cit> . similar studies of heterologously expressed ion channels from other insect species including t. castaneum, in combination with the use of three-dimensional models based on the crystal structure of molluscan acetylcholine binding proteins  <cit> , will likely prove useful in the search for novel compounds that show selectivity for receptors of certain insect species as well as in determining the mechanisms of insecticide interaction with cys-loop lgics. for insect nachrs, functional expression in heterologous systems has so far proven elusive  <cit> , although low levels of receptor activity have been observed for the locust schistocerca gregaria αl <dig> subunit expressed in xenopus oocytes  <cit> . nevertheless, drosophila nachr α subunits can form robust functional channels when coexpressed with a vertebrate β <dig> subunit  <cit>  and studies on such hybrid receptors have provided insights into the selectivity of neonicotinoids for insect nachrs over those of vertebrates, regions of subunit proteins involved in imidacloprid interactions and the actions of different neonicotinoids  <cit> . these studies have highlighted dα <dig> and dα <dig> as being sensitive to imidacloprid. also, mpα <dig>  which is the aphid myzus persicae ortholog of dα <dig>  shows high levels of imidacloprid binding when coexpressed with the rat β <dig> subunit  <cit> . the functional expression of nachrs with insect β subunits has yet to be achieved but it is worth noting that the ortholog of dβ <dig> is an α subunit  in all insects so far studied outside the drosophila genus  <cit> . since members of the dβ <dig> group are closely related to those of the dα <dig> and dα <dig> groups  and share an insertion in loop f which may contribute to imidacloprid sensitivity  <cit> , it would be of interest to determine whether tcasα <dig> is sensitive to neonicotinoids. if this is the case, it would also be worth studying tcasα <dig>  which appears to be a product of gene duplication of tcasα <dig>  and assessing how both subunits contribute to neonicotinoid sensitivity particularly in light of the finding that gene duplication has given rise to insecticide resistance at another synaptic target site, acetylcholinesterase  <cit> .

parental rnai, where rna interference arising from double-stranded rna introduced into the mother also spreads to the offspring, is highly efficient in tribolium  <cit> . the combination of genome information and the use of rnai in c. elegans has proved considerably instructive in determining roles played by genes  <cit> . thus, the beetle provides a powerful tool for studying gene function in an insect pest species. for example, rnai could be used to elucidate the roles played by tribolium cys-loop lgic subunits in various aspects of development, behaviour and response to insecticides. recently, it has been shown that a drosophila dα <dig> knockout mutant is highly resistant to spinosad  <cit> . studies have shown that t. castaneum is susceptible to spinosad, although to a lesser degree than other insect pests of stored wheat  <cit> . it will be of interest to determine the effect of silencing tcasα <dig> on the beetle's susceptibility to spinosad and perhaps validate in a pest species findings based on the drosophila genetic model organism.

CONCLUSIONS
using information from the tribolium castaneum genome sequencing project, we report, for the first time from an invertebrate pest species, a complete cys-loop lgic superfamily, which encodes for receptors that play important roles in the nervous system as well as for targets of widely-used insecticides. the present study enhances our understanding of the functional genomics of the insect cys-loop lgic superfamily. our findings reveal an emerging consensus that in over  <dig> million years of insect evolution, the cys-loop lgic superfamily has remained compact with only minor changes in gene numbers. however, alternative splicing, rna editing and the presence of divergent subunits broadens the cys-loop lgic proteome and generates species-specific receptor isoforms. thus, the paper provides several new insights into the molecular diversity of cys-loop lgics between different organisms and provides an important foundation for associating particular cys-loop lgic subtypes with development as well as for the generation of improved insecticides that target the red flour beetle.
