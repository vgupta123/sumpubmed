BACKGROUND
members of the basic helix-loop-helix  family of transcription factors, such as myf <dig>  myod, myogenin, and mrf <dig>  are crucially important in the specification and differentiation of skeletal muscle progenitors  <cit> . these myogenic regulatory factors  activate muscle-specific transcription by binding to an e-box in the promoter of numerous muscle-specific genes  <cit> . mrf genes are expressed in zebrafish somites in a characteristic temporal sequence, with myf <dig> at  <dig>  hours postfertilization   <cit> , myod at  <dig> hpf  <cit> , and myogenin at  <dig>  hpf  <cit> . the same temporal sequence occurs in mice  <cit> . these observations indicate that myf <dig> is the first mrf expressed during vertebrate myogenesis.

mechanisms that lead to myf <dig> activation at multiple sites in mouse embryos have been described  <cit> . yeast artificial chromosomes   <cit>  and bacterial artificial chromosomes   <cit>  have been used to map the promoter of mouse myf <dig>  suggesting that several different cis-regulatory elements are required to activate myf <dig> expression in different cells at different developmental times. an enhancer at - <dig>  kb is required for myf <dig> expression in the epaxial domain  <cit> . a 270-bp core enhancer at - <dig> kb directs myf <dig> expression in limbs and maintains myf <dig> expression in somites  <cit> . in xenopus, two negative regulatory elements have been identified: an interferon regulatory factor-like dna binding element that down-regulates xmyf <dig> expression in differentiating myocytes  <cit> , and a distal tcf- <dig> binding site by which wnt/β-catenin signaling restricts xmyf <dig> expression to the midline mesoderm  <cit> . a t-box binding site mediates dorsal activation of xmyf <dig> transcription and is involved in the regulation of muscle development  <cit> . using transient expression of transgenes, we previously identified some cis-elements that regulate zebrafish myf <dig>  <cit> . recently, lee et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that foxd <dig> binds to the -82/- <dig> regulatory module and regulates zebrafish myf <dig> expression during early somitogenesis. these observations highlight the complicated and dispersed nature of the upstream elements that control somite- and stage-specific expression of myf <dig> 

to elucidate the nature of this finely tuned control mechanism, we needed a transgenic line that recapitulates the specific endogenous expression pattern of myf <dig>  such a line requires a transgene that contains a very long upstream region of myf <dig>  we modified the techniques used in mice  <cit>  and present here a highly efficient method for engineering zebrafish bac. the bac is an escherichia coli f factor-based vector that is capable of propagating cloned dna fragments up to  <dig> kb long  <cit> . previously, jessen et al.  <cit>  reported a homologous recombination technique for bac cloning to generate transgenic zebrafish. this technique, however, is rather laborious because it requires a chi-based plasmid with a very large recombination targeting region. with our new method, we efficiently generate transgenic lines containing a 156-kb genomic sequence of myf <dig>  replaced with green fluorescent protein  in the coding region. we find that the 156-kb genomic sequence is long enough to recapitulate the endogenous myf <dig> transcription pattern during the somitogenesis and pharyngula development stages. to characterize the functions of individual cis-regulatory elements, we also generated several transgenic lines that carry various lengths of the zebrafish myf <dig> upstream sequence. comparing the gfp expression patterns of these lines, we identified and characterized the functions of upstream regulatory elements, including a repressive element and tissue-specific enhancers for jaw and fin muscles, bones, eyes, somites, olfactory organs, and the presomitic mesoderm. whole-mount in situ hybridization reveals that endogenous zebrafish myf <dig> transcripts are first detectable in the presomitic mesoderm  <cit> . in contrast, myf <dig> expression has not been observed by in situ hybridization in the presomitic mesoderm of mouse embryos, although weak signals have been detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction   <cit> . these comparisons illustrate the advantage of our transgenic lines for studying the initiation and regulation of myf <dig>  particularly in the presomitic mesoderm.

RESULTS
genomic organization of zebrafish myf <dig> is conserved with mammals
we cloned the myf <dig> genomic locus using a sequential screening method. we screened  <dig> primary pools of zebrafish bac library clones using pcr; one  was positive. we then screened  <dig> secondary pools derived from p <dig> and found  <dig> positive pools. subsequent screening of the positive pools identified a single myf5-positive bac clone with a 156-kb insert as indicated by pfge. we searched sequence databases from the sanger institute and identified a contig, ctg <dig>  which contains the entire sequence of the myf <dig> bac clone. blast analysis using the myf <dig> coding region and junction sequences flanking the t <dig> and sp <dig> sites showed that the bac clone spans the sequences of ctg <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig> kb, with the coding sequence starting at  <dig>  thus, the myf <dig> 5' and 3' regions contained in this bac clone extend approximately  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb, respectively, beyond the coding sequence.

radiation hybrid mapping of zebrafish myf <dig> revealed that myf <dig> is located on linkage group  <dig> , between expressed sequence tags  fb62d <dig> and fb78c <dig>  and at  <dig>  cr from est marker z <dig> . this syntenic relationship indicates that the region of zebrafish lg <dig> between est markers fa05f <dig> and fk68a <dig>  is conserved with human chromosome 12q13–12q <dig> 

dna fragments of myf5:gfp are inherited
we generated several transgenic lines by microinjecting zebrafish embryos with myf5:gfp bac segment and raising them to adulthood. we identified germ-line transmission by looking for gfp fluorescence in embryos from crossing with wild-type fish. we generated  <dig> lines with the entire myf <dig> upstream segment ,  <dig> lines with -9977/- <dig> ,  <dig> lines with -6212/- <dig> ,  <dig> lines with -2937/- <dig> ,  <dig> lines with -2456/- <dig> , and  <dig> lines with -290/- <dig> group . the f <dig> segregation frequencies for these transgenic lines ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, indicating a single insertion site of transgene for each line.

the 156-kb genomic sequence of myf <dig> drives gfp expression in muscle precursors
in embryos derived from myf5:gfp transgenic lines with the 156-kb genomic sequence , gfp fluorescence first appears very weakly at  <dig>  hpf , reaches detectable levels in the segmental plate by  <dig>  hpf , and expands to  <dig> somite pairs in  <dig> hpf embryos . at  <dig> hpf, the gfp signals are strong and mainly restricted to the somites and segmental plates and fluorescence is reduced in the more rostral  somites. prominent gfp signals also appear in the adaxial cells . the gfp mrna in embryos derived from myf5:gfp transgenic lines were also detected by using digoxigenin -labeling gfp riboprobes. the gfp transcripts were detectable at  <dig>  hpf  and  <dig>  hpf , which matches the spatial and temporal pattern of endogenous myf <dig> expression as indicated by mrna in situ hybridization   <cit> . these results indicate that expression of gfp in the myf5:gfp transgenic line recapitulates endogenous myf <dig> expression.

by  <dig> hpf, gfp fluorescence is absent from rostral  somites . cross-sections reveal that gfp-positive cells are distributed throughout the myotome . we use the f <dig> antibody to label slow muscle fibers and find that both slow and fast muscle fibers express gfp in the myf5:gfp transgenic line . in addition, we find no significant differences when comparing the gfp expression patterns of the four independent myf5:gfp lines , indicating that expression of the transgene is unaffected by its chromosomal location.

gfp expression reveals the development of head skeletal muscles
by the end of segmentation stages, pectoral fin  and myotomal , dorsal rostral myotomal , muscle precursors express gfp . by  <dig> hpf, in addition to muscle precursors of pm, m, and drm, two eye muscle precursors, the superior oblique  and inferior oblique , also express gfp  and endogenous myf <dig> transcripts . at  <dig> hpf, gfp signals are observed in almost all cranial muscle precursors, including the adductor hyomandibulae , adductor mandibulae , adductor operculi , constrictor hyoideus ventralis , dilatator operculi , inferior oblique , lateral rectus , medial rectus , sternohyoideus , superior oblique , and transverse ventralis  . compared with the broad expression of gfp fluorescence, expression in both gfp and endogenous myf <dig> transcripts is restricted to a tiny spot on each pharyngeal arch at this stage on lateral views  by using whole-mount in situ hybridization. however, either gfp or myf <dig> signals were observed at this stage on ventral views . thus, we conclude that this inconsistency between gfp mrna and fluorescence should be due to the stability of gfp that persists even though transcription of myf <dig> has ended. based on these observations, we propose that most and possibly all cranial muscle precursors transiently express myf <dig> before  <dig> hpf, although myod expression is still evident at this stage .

proximal element regulates myf <dig> expression in the presomitic mesoderm
a unique characteristic of myf <dig> expression, compared with other known mrfs, is its strong and widespread expression in the presomitic mesoderm . we used the transgenic lines to identify the regulatory sequences required for this aspect of myf <dig> expression. at  <dig> hpf, tg:gfp) embryos show strong gfp expression in adaxial cells, presomitic mesoderm, and developing somites . transgenic lines carrying shorter upstream segments, -9977/- <dig> tg:gfp) , -6212/- <dig> tg:gfp), -2937/- <dig> tg:gfp), -2456/- <dig> tg:gfp) , also show strong gfp signals in the presomitic mesoderm. however, in the transgenic line carrying the -290/- <dig> segment tg:gfp), the gfp signal in the presomitic mesoderm is weak . these results suggest that the minimal enhancer that regulates myf <dig> expression in the presomitic mesoderm is located within the -290/- <dig> segment.

nc: notochord; sc: spinal cord; psm: presomitic mesoderm; +: gfp expression; -: no expression.

repressive element located at -80/- <dig> kb blocks gfp expression in notochord driven by module -2937/-2457
we observe no gfp signal in the notochords of embryos derived from line tg:gfp). however, tg:gfp) , tg:gfp) , and tg:gfp)  embryos have gfp expression in their notochords, suggesting that an element located within -80/- <dig> kb normally represses myf <dig> expression in notochord. we also observe no gfp in notochords of embryos derived from lines tg:gfp) and tg:gfp) , suggesting that the -2937/- <dig> segment contains a notochord enhancer element. to test this hypothesis, we constructed and microinjected three different gfp expression plasmids: pegfpmtata contains a tata-box of cmv fused to egfp, pegfpm contains one copy of segment -2937/- <dig>  and pegfpm contains segment -2937/- <dig> in the opposite orientation . only  <dig> %  of pegfpmtata-injected embryos are gfp-positive, and in no cases is gfp expressed either in notochord or myocytes . however,  <dig> % of pegfpm-injected embryos and  <dig> % of pegfpm-injected embryos express gfp in both notochord and myocytes . thus, the -2937/- <dig> segment is a typical, orientation-independent enhancer module for myf <dig> expression in notochord and myocytes.

multiple modules regulate myf <dig> expression in the spinal cord, bones, eyes, and olfactory pits
in embryos derived from tg:gfp), gfp fluorescence appears in adductor mandibulae  and dorsally caudal to the hindbrain at  <dig> hpf . by  <dig> hpf, gfp fluorescence is stronger and extends farther caudally , including cells of both the surface ectoderm and spinal cord . from 21– <dig> hpf, the embryos derived from tg:gfp) show gfp fluorescence in bone, including the basihyal, sternohyal, and palatoquadrate bones, and meckel's cartilage , and in the eyes . we find no significant differences when comparing the gfp expression patterns of the four independent myf5:gfp lines , indicating that expression of the transgene is unaffected by its chromosomal location. in the head of embryos derived from tg:gfp), gfp is expressed primarily in the eyes  and olfactory placode , suggesting that eye and olfactory enhancers are located within the -2937/- <dig> segment. again, we believe that expression of the transgene is unaffected by its chromosomal location, because no significant differences were observed when comparing the gfp expression patterns of the three independent myf5:gfp lines .

discussion
stable transgenic lines provide greater sensitivity for studies of gene regulation and confirm transient transgenesis studies
to understand the complex spatial and temporal regulation of myf <dig> expression, we analyzed the function of the zebrafish myf <dig> promoter using transgenic constructs. our previous analysis of embryos injected with various lengths of myf <dig> promoter driven reporter genes  showed that -9977/- <dig>  <cit> , -6212/- <dig>  <cit> , and -2937/- <dig>  <cit>  produce gfp-positive signals in the notochord, whereas no fluorescence is observed in the notochord when embryos are injected with -2456/- <dig>  <cit> . these observations suggest that the notochord-specific element is located in the -2937/- <dig> segment, consistent with the germ-line transmission analysis of our present study .

the regulatory elements for muscle lineage-specific expression, including slow and fast myotomes, are controlled by hedgehog signaling and myocyte enhancer factor  <dig>   <cit> . we propose that the somite- and myotomal-restricted enhancer element is located within the -290/- <dig> segment . thus, it is important to look for the putative myotomal enhancers, such as hedgehog-responsive elements and mef2-binding sites within this segment. after sequence analysis, we find that there are one mef2-binding  and two gli-binding  sites located within the -290/- <dig> segment. in addition, our previous studies showed that the -82/- <dig> cassette that contains a binding site for the cognate trans-acting factor foxd <dig>  <cit>  is able to drive transient expression in somites  <cit> . on the basis of these observations, we propose that -82/- <dig> motif is a key element for driving somite specificity, and multiple elements within the -290/- <dig> segment such as mef2- and gli-binding sites are responsible for myotomal expression. together, these results demonstrate that transient analysis is suitable for rapid identification of putative cis-elements, whereas germ-line transmission studies provide great sensitivity and enable confirmation.

many myf <dig> regulatory modules are similar between mouse and zebrafish
few reports have proposed using transgenic animals to study the delicate transcriptional regulation of myf <dig>  only three species  have been documented so far. with limited information on the interactions between trans-acting factors and their binding sequences upstream of the myf <dig> gene, the alternative ways to study transcriptional mechanistic conservation are those making comparisons of sequence similarities and genomic organizations of the myf <dig> gene among these three known species. as in zebrafish, myf <dig> expression is regulated by multiple upstream sites in mouse embryos  <cit> . multiple enhancers are distributed throughout a 90-kb region of the mouse mrf4/myf <dig> locus, including a limb enhancer at -58/- <dig> kb, two head muscle enhancers at -88/- <dig> and -45/- <dig> kb, a repressive element at -58/- <dig>  kb, a central nervous system-specific enhancer at - <dig> /- <dig>  kb, a hypaxial myotome enhancer at  <dig> / <dig>  kb, an epaxial myotome enhancer at - <dig> /- <dig>  kb, and branchial enhancers at - <dig> /- <dig>  and  <dig> / <dig>  kb  <cit> . gene regulation of myf <dig> in frog is apparently quite different, because only a relatively short region of flanking dna  is sufficient to drive endogenous xenopus xmyf <dig> expression at gastrula stages. two negative regulatory elements  have been identified in the xmyf <dig> promoter  <cit> . it seems likely that each species  uses distinct mechanisms, given the developmental differences in timing and signaling.

the genomic organizations of myf <dig> regulatory modules are also conserved between mice and zebrafish. as in mouse, the zebrafish regulatory modules that are responsible for lineage-specific expression of myf <dig> are distributed throughout a large  region of the mrf4/myf <dig> locus . the locations and functions of some enhancers are similar to those of mouse myf <dig>  for example, the fin muscle enhancer and the cranial muscle enhancer at -80/- <dig> kb probably correspond to the mouse limb and head muscle enhancers at -88/- <dig> kb, a repressive one at -10/- <dig> kb is similar to the mouse repressor at -58/- <dig>  kb, and a spinal cord enhancer at -6/- <dig> kb is similar to the mouse central nervous system-specific enhancer at - <dig> /- <dig>  kb .

on the other hand, however, we also identified enhancers that have not been described in mouse, including a bone enhancer at -6/- <dig> kb, a notochord enhancer at -3/- <dig>  kb, and a presomitic mesoderm enhancer at -290/- <dig> bp . epaxial- and hypaxial-specific enhancers have been identified in mouse myf <dig>  <cit> , but we have not seen muscle lineage-specific enhancers, especially slow and fast muscle enhancers in zebrafish, with the exception of limb and head muscle enhancers. this finding suggests that more transgenic lines that carry shorter elements should be generated, especially deletions within the -80/- <dig> kb and -10/- <dig> kb regions. taken together, we propose that the regulation of zebrafish myf <dig> is more similar to mouse myf <dig> than that of xenopus.

excellent experimental materials to study transcriptional regulation on myf5
myf <dig> is the first member of the mrf family expressed during somitogenesis in zebrafish. knockdown of myf <dig> in zebrafish results in malformation of somites and brain defects, indicating that trunk and head myogenesis is impaired, underscoring the importance of understanding the regulation of myf <dig>  numerous factors have been implicated as upstream regulators of myf <dig>  including extracellular signals, such as shh, wingless , and fibroblast growth factor   <cit> . shh, produced by the notochord and floor plate of the neural tube, and wnt proteins, produced by the dorsal neural tube and surface ectoderm, have been implicated in the maintenance of mouse myf <dig>  <cit> , xenopus xmyf <dig>  <cit> , and zebrafish myf <dig>  <cit>  expression. together with our previous identification of the cognate trans-acting factor, foxd <dig>  <cit> , these results demonstrate that the complex spatial and temporal pattern of myf <dig> gene expression is regulated by multiple upstream regulatory modules.

CONCLUSIONS
we generated several transgenic lines of zebrafish that contain various lengths of zebrafish myf <dig> upstream genomic sequence linked to the gfp reporter gene. we demonstrate that the 156-kb genomic sequence  is able to recapitulate the pattern of endogenous myf <dig> expression. by dissecting this upstream region, we further show that tissue-specific regulatory elements are organized as modules in various regions of the 5'-flanking sequence. these transgenic lines not only provide excellent materials for studying the regulatory mechanism of myf <dig>  but they also will facilitate mutant screens to identify novel genes that regulate somitogenesis and more detailed studies to the morphogenesis of somites, presomitic mesoderm, and cranial muscles.
