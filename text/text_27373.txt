BACKGROUND
chlorophyll  retention in mature soybean seeds is a major problem for brazilian soybean growers. if more than 9 %  <cit>  of their harvest shows this phenotype, marketability will be compromised, resulting in serious financial losses. the “green seed problem” has been reported in oilseeds since the early 1990s, i.e. as detrimental to soybean seed and oil quality  and to canola oil quality .

retention of chl in soybean seeds is mainly associated with low rainfall and high temperatures during the maturation phase. these are common environmental conditions in tropical areas such as the brazilian cerrado biome where approximately 45 % of the brazilian soybean seed production is concentrated   <cit> . besides the climate, other factors or practices during pre- and post-harvesting, such as application of desiccants and premature harvesting followed by drying at high temperatures are also reported to result in retention of chlorophyll in soybean seeds  <cit> . in addition to these environmental factors there is also variation in the susceptibility of soybean cultivars to green seed production under stress. the cultivar brs  <dig> has been previously described as tolerant, producing less green seeds under stressful conditions whereas mg/br  <dig> was found to be more susceptible  <cit> .

during leaf senescence, the first observable change is yellowing of green tissues. yellowing is also observed during normal seed maturation which is expected to be a degreening process resulting from the conversion of chl into colourless products in a multi-step catabolic pathway similar to that described for leaf senescence . leaf senescence has been extensively studied and mutant lines exhibiting altered leaf senescence have been described for several different species e.g. arabidopsis, rice, medicago and soybean. these mutant lines are commonly known as stay green  mutants . however, in contrast to leaf senescence, very little is known about chl degradation in developing and maturing seeds. degreening in maturing seeds cannot be considered senescence but both leaf senescence and seed maturation require chl degradation for their completion.

in leaves chl degradation occurs in the chloroplast and requires six known chl-catabolic enzymes  and a metal-chelating substance  that remains to be identified  <cit> . the breakdown starts with the two-step reduction of chl b to chl a, catalysed by chl b reductase and 7-hydroxymethyl chl a reductase   <cit> . in the next step the central mg2+ ion of chl is removed by an unknown mcs to yield a mg-free chl intermediate known as pheophytin a . subsequently, pheophytinase , catalyses the hydrolysis of phein a to produce pheophorbide a   <cit> . the chlorin macrocycle of pheide a is oxygenolytically opened by pheide a oxygenase   <cit> , and the product of this reaction, red chl catabolite , is reduced to a non-phototoxic primary fluorescent chl catabolite  by rcc reductase   <cit> . thereafter, pfcc is transferred to the cytosol and stored in vacuoles as non-fluorescent chl-catabolite  <cit> 

in addition to cces and mcs, the sgr protein acts as a key regulator of chl degradation. sgr is a nuclear gene encoding a chloroplast targeted protein, and its homologs exist as either single or duplicated genes in higher plants  <cit> . most higher plant species have two or more sgr homologs , all of which are predicted to localize to the chloroplast  <cit> . in a recent study, phylogenetic analysis suggested that the soybean genes, glyma11g <dig> and glyma01g <dig>  are homologs of pssgr, atnye <dig>  atnye <dig>  and ossgr  <cit> . these genes were named d <dig>  and d <dig>  and described in soybean as two unlinked, paralogous nuclear genes, whose double-recessive mutant  results in chl retention in soybean leaves and seeds  <cit> .

the increase of environmental stress over the past decades is a growing concern worldwide especially for agricultural productivity. efforts have already been made to understand the influence of growing conditions and drying processes on the retention of green pigments in soybean seeds and how it affects the physiological and biochemical characteristics of these seeds  <cit> . so far, the molecular mechanisms of chl degradation in seeds and consequently of chl retention remain unsolved. in this study we have used maturing seeds of two soybean cultivars differing in susceptibility to stress-induced chl retention to investigate the molecular basis of chlorophyll retention in seeds. a global gene expression approach was performed in association with targeted gene expression analysis  to demonstrate that the green phenotype in stressed soybean seeds is related to impaired expression of chlorophyll catabolic genes , stay-green genes and also of some photosynthetic proteins. our results contribute both to the understanding of the physiological underpinning of chl degradation in seeds and to the identification of possible breeding targets for future soybean improvement.

RESULTS
chlorophyll content in maturing soybean seeds
plants of susceptible and tolerant soybean cultivars were grown under non-stressed conditions and during the late seed maturation phase some plants were transferred to a condition of combined heat and drought stress. seeds of both cultivars  were harvested in three stages of maturation  according to a scale proposed by sw ritchie, jj hanway and he thompson  <cit>  . r <dig> seed samples  were considered “green” if there was no sign of chl degradation and they were still completely green. at r <dig> there were no appreciable differences in chl degradation between the different cultivars and between environmental conditions . at r <dig>  when chl degradation should have started, the greenish seeds were considered “green”. at this stage there was an expected decrease in percentage of green seeds due to normal chlorophyll degradation during maturation but no significant difference was observed between cultivars or environmental conditions . at r <dig>  when seeds should be yellow and the presence of chl is a potential problem for seed quality, any sign of green pigmentation classified seeds as “green”, characterizing chlorophyll retention. at this stage, the susceptible cultivar produced, under stress, a significantly higher level of green seeds, reaching 22 % of green seeds against 1 % produced by the tolerant cultivar . for more accuracy in determining the chl retention in stressed soybean seeds, chl a and chl b were measured by hplc .fig.  <dig> percentage of green seeds produced under non-stressed  and stressed  environmental conditions by the susceptible  and tolerant  cultivars in three stages of maturation . bars represent the mean values ± se of six independent biological replicates. lowercase letters represent statistically significant differences  between different environmental conditions within the same cultivar and developmental stage and uppercase letters between different cultivars within the same environmental condition and developmental stage

as expected, the chlorophyll content decreased during maturation of both cultivars, independently of the environmental condition. chl a was present at higher levels in the seeds than chl b. the effect of stress on seed chlorophyll content was variable depending on the cultivar and stage of maturation. at r <dig>  when the presence of chlorophyll is a problem, there was only difference between stressed and non-stressed seeds of the susceptible cultivar and the levels of chl a and b in stressed seeds of this cultivar were significantly higher than in stressed seeds of the tolerant material. this indicates that the difference in susceptibility to chl retention between the two cultivars is genetic.

global gene expression profiling of stressed and non-stressed seeds of the susceptible soybean cultivar
a transcriptome analysis was carried out to identify changes in gene expression in soybean seeds of the susceptible cultivar, produced under non-stressed and combined heat and drought stress conditions during the late stages of maturation. the microarray used in this study covered  <dig>  soybean transcripts. after normalization and background removal, data was filtered to keep probe sets with a signal above  <dig> in at least one of the conditions analysed, leaving  <dig>  probe sets for further analysis.

r <dig> samples were composed of a mixture of seeds with variable levels of chl degradation, which was considered to reflect slightly different stages of maturation. based on these observations and on the results of pca analysis  we decided to use only data from the stages r <dig> and r <dig> for further analysis, in order to avoid ambiguous results.

for the differential expression analysis a comparison was made between stressed and non-stressed seeds during maturation, from r <dig> to r <dig>  in total  <dig> genes exhibited at least a 2-fold change in expression . expression of the selected genes was analysed with the seed-specific pathway of the page-man/mapman package . this pathway efficiently captures the most relevant molecular processes in seeds   <cit>  and it allows a global overview of the ontologies of the up- and down-regulated genes in stressed seeds, during the maturation process.fig.  <dig> seed mapman molecular network map. log <dig> ratios are used to express relative transcript levels in stressed versus non-stressed soybean seeds during maturation . red squares depict higher levels in stressed seeds; blue squares higher levels in non-stressed seeds. only ratios with p values lower or equal to  <dig>  are displayed



in the seed-specific pathways multiple ontologies were enriched. as was expected, the stress significantly changed expression of genes related to a large number of different cell functions. for example, photosynthesis, transcription factors such as ap2/erebp, minor cho , dna repair/synthesis, cell wall modification, seed storage proteins, flavonoids , lipid transfer proteins and ga metabolism were among the up-regulated pathways. genes related to tca, nucleotide degradation and rna binding, transcription and processing were down regulated as compared to non-stressed seeds.

we focused on genes related to photosynthesis and to genes encoding enzymes involved in the chl degradation pathway, because our aim was to find genes related to chl retention in soybean seeds. expression of selected candidate genes were further studied using rt-qpcr analysis, comparing stressed and non-stressed seeds of the two soybean cultivars at r <dig> and r <dig> maturation stages.

expression analysis of chl binding proteins in stressed and non-stressed soybean seeds
chl degradation during leaf senescence is coupled to degradation of the chl-protein complexes found in the thylakoid membrane, including psi, psii and cytochrome b6f  <cit> . although we did not measure accumulation/degradation of the chl-protein complexes, the expression of genes encoding for such proteins during the maturation process of stressed and non-stressed soybean seeds, can give us an idea of what happens with the photosystems and more specifically with the apoproteins that bind chls.

the chosen transcripts represent some of the genes encoding for chl-binding proteins, playing roles in photosystem i , photosystem ii  and cytochrome b6f . the expression of cyt b6f, lhca and psbb was higher in stressed than non-stressed seeds of the susceptible cultivar in r <dig> and there was significant difference in expression between stressed seeds of the susceptible cultivar and stressed seeds of the tolerant one. however, the expression of psbc was higher in stressed seeds of both cultivars in r <dig> . psba and psbd are genes encoding for the core proteins of psii . expression of both genes towards the end of maturation , was higher in stressed seeds of both cultivars. however, expression of psba was significantly higher in stressed seeds of the susceptible cultivar compared to stressed seeds of the tolerant one while expression of psbd was higher in non-stressed seeds of the tolerant cultivar than in non-stressed seeds of the susceptible cultivar . as the core subunits of psi also bind chl, the expression of the genes psaa and psab encoding for the proteins a <dig> and a <dig> , was also analysed. at r <dig>  expression of psaa was higher only in stressed seeds of the susceptible cultivar, while for psbb the expression was higher in stressed seeds of both cultivars .fig.  <dig> gene expression analysis by real-time quantitative pcr represented as the calibrated normalized relative quantity  for cyt b6f, lhca, psbb and psbc. gene expression is shown for non-stressed  and stressed seeds  of the susceptible  and tolerant  cultivars in three stages of maturation . bars represent the mean values ± se of three independent biological replicates. lowercase letters represent statistically significant differences  between different environmental conditions within the same cultivar and developmental stage and uppercase letters between different cultivars within the same environmental condition and developmental stage

expression of ccgs in stressed and non-stressed soybean seeds
to better understand the breakdown of chl in soybean seeds and, consequently, its retention, we analysed the expression of some of the genes encoding for enzymes in the chl degradation pathway. among the ten ccgs tested by rt-qpcr in the present study, nyc1_ <dig> and pph <dig> were the most affected by stress and most likely to be related to chl retention .fig.  <dig> gene expression analysis by real-time quantitative pcr represented as the calibrated normalized relative quantity  for nyc1_ <dig>  nyc1_ <dig>  clh, pph <dig>  pph <dig> and pph <dig>  gene expression is shown for non-stressed  and stressed seeds  of the susceptible  and tolerant  cultivars in three stages of maturation . bars represent the mean values ± se of three independent biological replicates. lowercase letters represent statistically significant differences  between different environmental conditions within the same cultivar and developmental stage and uppercase letters between different cultivars within the same environmental condition and developmental stage



the first step in chl degradation is the conversion of chl b to chl a which is catalysed by chl b reductase. defects in the synthesis of this enzyme are known to cause chl retention in leaves of rice non-yellow colouring  <dig>  mutants during senescence  <cit> . the expression of two transcripts encoding for chl b reductase  was analysed. although nyc1_ <dig> is higher expressed in stressed seeds of both cultivars in r <dig> , chl b is still present in stressed seeds of the susceptible cultivar at the end of the maturation . however, expression of nyc1_ <dig> is only higher in stressed seeds of the tolerant cultivar , which could explain why mature seeds of this cultivar don’t contain chl b . this suggests that expression of both copies of nyc <dig> might be necessary for complete conversion of chl b to a in seeds of soybean.

chl breakdown continues with the removal of mg2+ and phytol by mcs and pph/chlorophyllases , resulting in pheide a. the expression of four genes coding for clh was analysed by rt-qpcr, but only one of them was expressed in the analysed samples . the transcript level of this clh gene was higher in stressed seeds of the susceptible cultivar in r <dig> both as compared to its non-stressed seeds as to the stressed seeds of the tolerant one. there was no difference between stressed and non-stressed seeds of the tolerant cultivar . despite these results, stressed mature seeds of the susceptible cultivar didn’t completely degrade the chl . as a result, no correlation was found between clh expression and chlorophyll content .

the mechanism of mg-dechelation has not yet been fully resolved  <cit> . clh, which hydrolyses phytol from chl, was believed to be active during senescence-related chl breakdown  <cit> . however, so far clh action has been classified as essential or not essential, depending on the species. the double mutant of atclh <dig> and atclh <dig> in arabidopsis did not generate a stay-green phenotype  <cit>  which suggested that clh might not play a major role in chl degradation during leaf senescence in arabidopsis  <cit> . instead, the functional characterization of pph has indicated that this enzyme is necessary for chl breakdown in arabidopsis  <cit>  and rice  <cit> .

the analysis of pph expression in our seed samples indicates that pheophytinases may play a major role in dephytylation in seeds. the expression of pph <dig>  and pph <dig>  decreased during maturation, while pph <dig>  increased . pph <dig> expression seems to be required later in maturation, especially in stressed seeds of the tolerant cultivar. the expression of this gene was significantly higher in stressed seeds of the tolerant cultivar than in stressed seeds of the susceptible one. pphs seem to be playing a major role in phytol removal in soybean seeds produced under stress, as stressed seeds of the tolerant cultivar do not retain greenness to the same extent as stressed seeds of the susceptible one .

downstream of the degradation pathway, after phein a is converted by pph to pheide a, this intermediate is subsequently converted to the red-coloured molecule rcc in a reaction mediated by pao. the expression of two genes encoding for pao was analysed: pao <dig>  and pao <dig> . both genes were higher expressed in stressed seeds of the susceptible and tolerant cultivars mainly in r <dig>  but the expression of pao <dig> was higher in both stressed and non-stressed seeds of the tolerant cultivar than in stressed and non-stressed seeds of the susceptible cultivar . in the next step of chl degradation, the red pigment  is converted to the non-coloured but blue-fluorescing product called primary fluorescent chlorophyll catabolite by rccr. the primary fluorescent chlorophyll catabolite is further converted to non-fluorescent chl-catabolites through different mechanisms depending on the species. the expression of rccr <dig>  in r <dig> was lower in stressed than non-stressed seeds of the susceptible cultivar . also the level of expression was lower for both stressed and non-stressed seeds of the tolerant cultivar when compared with seeds of the susceptible one produced in r <dig>  independently of cultivar or stage of maturation, there was no difference in expression of rccr <dig> as result of the stresses applied .fig.  <dig> gene expression analysis by real-time quantitative pcr represented as the calibrated normalized relative quantity  for pao <dig>  pao <dig>  rccr <dig> and rccr <dig>  gene expression is shown for non-stressed  and stressed seeds  of the susceptible  and tolerant  cultivars in three stages of maturation . bars represent the mean values ± se of three independent biological replicates. lowercase letters represent statistically significant differences  between different environmental conditions within the same cultivar and developmental stage and uppercase letters between different cultivars within the same environmental condition and developmental stage



stay-green gene expression is impaired in stressed/green seeds
the expression of both d <dig>  and d <dig>  in soybean seeds increased during the progression of seed maturation, with higher levels in r <dig> . in r <dig> the expression of both genes was higher in stressed than non-stressed seeds only of the tolerant cultivar which exhibited consistently higher expression levels of both genes when compared with the susceptible cultivar.fig.  <dig> gene expression analysis by real-time quantitative pcr represented as the calibrated normalized relative quantity  for d <dig> and d <dig>  gene expression is shown for non-stressed  and stressed seeds  of the susceptible  and tolerant  cultivars in three stages of maturation . bars represent the mean values ± se of three independent biological replicates. lowercase letters represent statistically significant differences  between different environmental conditions within the same cultivar and developmental stage and uppercase letters between different cultivars within the same environmental condition and developmental stage



in general, most of the genes analysed follow a pattern of decreased expression together with a decrease in chlorophyll content during seed maturation, except for nyc1_ <dig> and  <dig>  pph <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig>  in the correlation analysis  it is evident that only expression of d <dig>  d <dig>  nyc1_ <dig> and pph <dig> showed a significant negative correlation with chlorophyll content, while all the other genes were either positively correlated or showed no correlation with chlorophyll content.fig.  <dig> heat map of correlations. each square represents the spearman correlation coefficient between expression of genes related to chlorophyll degradation and chlorophyll content. traits were classified by hierarchical clustering using the distance function 1-correlation in r. the significance of the correlations were calculated as anova p-values and are represented by asterisks 



discussion
for over a decade brazilian soybean growers have been reporting the occurrence of green seeds at the end of the maturation process and it has become a great concern to the soybean market in the last few years . however, chlorophyll retention in seeds is not unique to brazil or to soybean as it has been reported in other countries and in canola seeds . a similar phenotype to chlorophyll retention, called stay-green has been described in leaves and seeds of mutants of different species  <cit> . although several of these mutations have been described for the actual sgr gene  <cit>  there are also mutations described in ccgs resulting in a stay-green phenotype, for example: pao  <cit> , osnyc <dig>  <cit> , atpph  <cit> , and osnyc <dig>  <cit> .

although reports of chl retention in seeds can be tracked to the early nineties  <cit> , the molecular basis of this phenomenon has not yet been unravelled. using a rt-qpcr approach we demonstrate that combined heat and drought stress affect expression of genes in the chl degradation pathway, as well as genes encoding chl-binding proteins in at least one cultivar and/or stage of maturation. under these stressful environmental conditions the two soybean cultivars also behaved differently regarding the chlorophyll retention phenotype. based on our results we suggest that impairment of expression of d <dig>  d <dig>  nyc1_ <dig> and pph <dig>  is the  cause of chlorophyll retention in mature soybean seeds of the susceptible cultivar.

how can impaired expression of sgr and ccgs lead to chl retention in stressed soybean seeds
during soybean seed maturation, d <dig> and d <dig> displayed very similar patterns of expression  as has been observed also during leaf senescence  <cit> . d <dig> and d <dig> are two unlinked nuclear loci that have been assumed to be paralogues in tetraploid soybean because homozygosity at both nuclear loci is required for the stay green phenotype, unlike other species in which the mutation of one gene has been shown to be sufficient for the stay-green phenotype  <cit> .

the increase in expression of both genes correlated with chlorophyll degradation during seed maturation and the higher expression of d <dig> and d <dig> in stressed seeds of the tolerant cultivar at r <dig> supported the more efficient chl degradation of this cultivar even under stressed conditions. however, seeds of the tolerant cultivar also expressed higher levels of both stay-green genes under non-stressed conditions when compared to the susceptible cultivar. this constitutive difference in levels of expression of sgr between the two cultivars may explain the difference in the efficiency of disassembly of the chl-protein complexes and chl degradation between the two cultivars under heat and drought stress. apparently, under normal environmental conditions the higher levels of sgr transcripts in seeds of the susceptible cultivar do not cause phenotypic differences but under stressed environmental conditions it clearly leads to a chl retention phenotype suggesting cryptic genetic variation between these two genotypes  <cit> .

besides the importance of sgr in the activation of chl-protein complex disassembly and, hence, chl-degradation in leaves  <cit> , it has been shown that the sgr <dig> and sgr <dig> genes are also necessary for seed degreening in arabidopsis  <cit> . interestingly the soybean d <dig> and d <dig> genes, which are functional orthologues of sgr in other species, promoted restoration of the wild type phenotype when introduced into the arabidopsis sgr mutant nye <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, it was recently found that the arabidopsis sgr <dig> physically interacts with all six known cces  and possibly forms a highly dynamic, multi-protein complex for chl degradation during natural senescence  <cit> .

the transcription of some chl-degradation genes, especially nyc <dig> and pph, were shown to be affected by the d1d <dig> mutation in a previous study with soybean  <cit> . consistent with this, the expression of nyc1_ <dig> and pph <dig>  mirrored the expression of d <dig> and d <dig> in soybean seeds. in fact, d <dig> and d <dig> are highly correlated with expression of nyc1_ <dig> and pph <dig>  suggesting co-regulation of these genes . d <dig>  d <dig>  pph <dig> and nyc1_ <dig> are the only genes with a significant negative correlation with chlorophyll content . therefore we hypothesise that the constitutively higher expression of these four genes aid greater tolerance to heat and drought stress regarding chlorophyll degradation in the seeds during maturation. future experiments overexpressing these genes in the susceptible cultivar will be needed to test this hypothesis.

approximately 75 % of the genes are present in more than one copy in the soybean genome  <cit>  due to at least two whole genome duplication  events within the last  <dig> million years . however, it is hypothesised that functions of duplicated genes can be very divergent  <cit> . this divergence is well exemplified by the terminal flower gene. among the four homologous genes of arabidopsis terminal flower  in soybean, only one has been found to control growth habit whereas the other copies are suggested to have alternative functions as they show divergent transcriptional patterns  <cit> . this also seems to be the case for the genes involved in seed degreening, especially nyc1_ <dig> and pph <dig>  which are the only copies that where strongly affected in stressed seeds.

the chl-binding proteins, on the other hand, correlated positively with the chlorophyll content of the seeds. the disassembly of the photosystems has been consistently reported to be directly related to chl degradation during senescence. for example, the breakdown of the lhcs, is crucial for degreening during leaf senescence  <cit> , as these peripheral antennas contain most of the chl. consequently, retention of lhcs and of core subunits of the psii have been associated with the stay-green phenotype in some species . the higher expression of psbc and psbb observed in mature stressed/green seeds was also reported in the rice stay-green mutant nyc4- <dig> in which the psii subunits cp <dig> and cp <dig>  were more stable than in the wild type during senescence  <cit> .

under stressful conditions the changes in expression of psba and psbd were different in seeds of the susceptible and tolerant cultivar. however, a possible retention of d <dig> protein  requires further investigation since this protein has the highest turnover among all the psii proteins and its abundance can be affected by several processes  <cit> .

although there are no reports so far about photosystem disassembly in seeds, we expect that the degreening in seeds also depends on the disassembly of lhcs and of other chl-binding proteins. with the exception of psba, which shows constant expression during maturation in stressed seeds of the susceptible cultivar, the pattern of expression of lhca, cyt b6f and core proteins of psi and psii decreased in both non-stressed and stressed seeds during maturation. this mostly reflects the normal disassembly of the photosynthetic apparatus during the maturation process that follows chl degradation.

the role of sgr genes as regulators of chlorophyll degradation during developmental and dark-induced senescence is well established in leaves and more recently the role of these genes in embryo degreening has been described  <cit> . during arabidopsis leaf senescence sgr <dig> and sgr <dig> act antagonistically in the control of chl degradation  <cit> , while in seeds they act synergistically  <cit> . although there has been great progress in understanding chlorophyll degradation in higher plants over the last few years, the seed degreening process still awaits to be resolved. studying in vitro interactions between sgr, chl-binding proteins and cces may possibly elucidate some aspects of chl degradation during seed ripening.

CONCLUSIONS
the combination of heat and drought stress during late seed maturation resulted in a “mild” stay-green phenotype and impaired expression of sgr  <dig> and  <dig> , pph <dig> and nyc1_ <dig> in soybean seeds of a susceptible soybean cultivar. this may be a case of cryptic genetic variation between these two genotypes as the genetic variation itself does not lead to chlorophyll retention under normal environmental conditions, but under combined heat and drought stress a clear green phenotype is observed in seeds of the susceptible cultivar. in other words we suggest that the constitutively higher expression of these four genes in fully mature seeds of the tolerant cultivar allows these seeds to cope with stressful conditions and complete chlorophyll degradation. the results described here deepen our understanding of chlorophyll retention in soybean seeds. the insights gained from this research will pave the way for new research ultimately providing direction to breeding programs aiming to produce tolerant cultivars. this is particularly pertinent as the hot and dry climate conditions which cause chlorophyll retention are increasingly common in the largest soybean production areas of the world and as a result there is an increasing need for resistant germplasm.
