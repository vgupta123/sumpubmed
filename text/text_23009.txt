BACKGROUND
biotin or vitamin h is a small hydrosoluble molecule produced by plants and a large number of prokaryotic organisms. it is involved in several metabolic pathways, including gluconeogenesis or fatty acid and amino acid catabolism, as a carboxyl carrier covalently linked to a specific lysine residue of a group of decarboxylases. this residue is located in a subunit called biotin carboxyl carrier protein , and biotin is attached in an atp-dependent reaction by a highly conserved family of biotin-protein ligases, the most characterized of which is the bira enzyme from e. coli  <cit> .

in addition to its physiological relevance, biotin has the interesting ability to bind to two homologous proteins: avidin, from the avian egg, and streptavidin, from bacteria. this interaction is the strongest non-covalent binding known   <cit> . taking advantage of this property, the interaction biotin-avidin has been exploited for a large number of biotechnological applications  <cit> . currently, biotinylation of proteins is achieved by different chemical reactions. the major disadvantage of this approach is the uncontrollable binding of biotin to sites of the target protein that can be important for its biological activity  <cit> .

to overcome this limitation, new approaches that mimic the physiological biotinylation of proteins have been developed, using different peptides containing an enzymatic biotinylation site  <cit> . one of the most useful and widely used is a  <dig> amino acid long peptide   <cit>  that constitutes a specific and efficient target for the biotin-protein ligase bira of e. coli  <cit> , which attaches covalently one biotin molecule to the single lysine residue within the bap sequence. when the bap peptide is genetically fused to the protein of interest, it is possible to obtain the protein biotinylated through two alternatives: in vitro, using the tagged protein and the purified enzyme  <cit> , or in vivo in mammalian cells following co-transfection with plasmids encoding both proteins  <cit> . the in vivo approach has the advantage of producing the tagged protein and the bira enzyme at constant rates avoiding purification of both molecules.

here we show the universal applicability to both secretory and membrane bound proteins of immunological interest of a biotinylation system based on the co-expression of a target protein and an engineered version of bira enzyme encoded by a single bigenic plasmid. secretory recombinant antibody derived molecules, for instance in the popular scfv format, a membrane bound and secretory ige fc fragment or a soluble version of a membrane receptor were shown to be efficiently biotinylated in vivo, offering a wide range of biological applications.

methods
construction of plasmids
the coding sequence for the bira enzyme  was amplified by pcr from genomic dna of e. coli k <dig> strain with oligonucleotides: 5'-tgtgtgcactcgatgaaggataacaccgtgcca-3'  and 5'-agactcgagttatttttctgcactacgcaggga-3' . the amplified fragment was ligated into apali and xhoi sites of put-sec vector  <cit>  to introduce a secretion signal. the hindiii/xhoi fragment from this plasmid was ligated into pcdna <dig> vector , obtaining the pcdna3-sec-bira plasmid.

the bap sequence was obtained by annealing and elongating with dna polymerase i klenow large fragment  the two oligonucleotides: 5'-agctggatccgccggaggctctggaggcctgaacgatatttccgaagctcagaaaat-3' and 5'-atcgaattcttaagagccttcgtgccattcgattttctgagcttcgaaaat-3'. the resulting fragment encodes a  <dig> amino acid linker  between the protein of interest and the bap sequence glndifeaqkiewhe. this fragment was inserted into a pcdna <dig> vector coding for the sv <dig> protein tag  <cit> , downstream sv <dig> between restriction sites bamhi/ecori.

plasmids coding for scfvp <dig> and scfv1e <dig> have been previously described  <cit> . these plasmids were digested with hindiii and bspei restriction enzymes to introduce the scfvs upstream the sv5-bap sequence, obtaining the pcdna3-scfv-sv5-bap plasmids. every time scfvs of different specificities were required, the hindiii/bspei fragments encoding the scfvs of interest were substituted to the previous ones.

to clone the transcriptional unit of the bira gene into the plasmid codifying for the scfv-sv5-bap protein, the bglii/bbsi fragment derived from pcdna3-sec-bira was blunted with klenow enzyme and inserted into the nrui-digested scfv-sv5-bap plasmids, resulting in the bigenic scfv-sv5-bap-bira plasmids.

to construct the bigenic αd1d2-sv5-bap-bira plasmid , the ndei/bspei fragment derived from pcdna3-sdα  <cit>  was ligated with the scfv-sv5-bap-bira vector, previously digested with the ndei and bspei restriction enzymes to remove the scfv.

the sequence coding for the truncated form of ige antibody t-ige with a sv <dig> tag  was previously obtained  <cit> . the bap sequence was inserted at the c-terminus of the soluble form  between bamhi and ecori sites. for the membrane-bound format t-mlige, with the transmembrane domain  at the c-terminus, both sv <dig> and bap tags were cloned at the n-terminus between apali and bstbi sites, after amplifying the fragment sv5-bap from the template scfv1e10-sv5-bap with oligonucleotides: 5'-tctgtgcactcggaaggcaaaccaatcccaaac-3' and 5'-tctttcgaatctgcacaagagccttcgtgccattc-3'. the bigenic sv5-εch3ch4-bap-bira  and sv5-bap-εch3ch4-tm-bira  plasmids were obtained as described above for scfvs.

enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay 
nunc immune-plates maxi sorp  were coated with the specific ligands in carbonate buffer:  <dig> μg/ml chimeric 1e <dig> and p <dig> antibodies  <cit>  for scfvp <dig> and scfv1e <dig> respectively;  <dig> μg/ml anti-human ige antibody  for t-sige;  <dig> μg/ml purified human ige  for αd1d2;  <dig> μg/ml streptavidin  for biotinylated scfv9e <dig>  after  <dig> h, plates were washed with pbs-tween <dig>  <dig> % and blocked with pbs-tween <dig>  <dig> %-bsa  1%. interactions were detected using a mouse anti-sv <dig> monoclonal antibody   and, as a secondary antibody, a horseradish peroxidase -conjugated anti-mouse igg  antibody , whereas biotinylation of molecules was checked by using hrp-conjugated streptavidin . all antibodies were diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions. reaction was developed with the  <dig> ', <dig> '-tetramethylbenzidine  reagent  and read at  <dig> nm with a microplate  <dig> reader .

sds-page and western blot
samples were analyzed by 10% sds-page under reducing conditions in tris-glycine buffer. following electrophoresis, gels were blotted onto pvdf membrane  with standard conditions  <cit> . membranes were blocked with pbs-milk 5% and subsequently incubated with specific antibodies.

to estimate the relative amount of biotinylated versus non-biotinylated proteins, a gel retardation assay was used. samples  were boiled for  <dig> min, incubated for  <dig> h at 4°c with  <dig> μg of purified streptavidin  and then resolved by sds-page under reducing conditions. the resulting complexes were detected by western blot using an anti-sv <dig> mab  and an hrp-conjugated anti-mouse igg  antibody , diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions.

to detect the cytosolic protein nsp <dig>  a guinea pig anti-nsp <dig> anti-serum  <cit>  and an hrp-conjugated anti-guinea pig igg antibody  were used.

flow cytometry assays
the sp2/ <dig> stable transfectoma expressing the 1e <dig> membrane sip was incubated with undiluted dialyzed supernatants from scfvp3-expressing transfectoma for  <dig> h at 4°c, washed twice with pbs-bsa 3%, and incubated again with streptavidin-quantum dots  <dig> , diluted 1: <dig>  in pbs-bsa 3%. streptavidin binding was detected by facs with a facscalibur flow cytometer  and data were analyzed with the cellquest software. as negative controls, supernatants containing scfv1e <dig> or the non-biotinylated scfvp <dig> were used.

similarly, rbl-sx <dig> cells were incubated with supernatants from scfv9e <dig> or t-sige-expressing transfectomas. as negative controls, supernatants with the non-biotinylated proteins were used.

cells expressing transiently the t-mlige protein were washed twice with pbs and once with pbs-bsa 3% and then incubated with streptavidin-quantum dots  <dig> or a fluorescein isothiocyanate -conjugated goat anti-human ige  antibody  .

immunofluorescence microscopy

purification of biotinylated molecules
biotinylated molecules from dialyzed supernatants were purified using softlink™ soft release avidin resin  according to the manufacturer's instructions. briefly, an appropriate bed volume of resin was poured into an empty chromatography column , washed, saturated with  <dig> mm biotin and regenerated. after equilibration with modified tbs buffer , the supernatant was loaded and elution performed with  <dig> mm biotin in equilibration buffer. fractions of  <dig> μl were collected and assayed by western blot analysis. all steps were performed at room temperature.

RESULTS
to achieve site-specific biotinylation of proteins within the secretory pathway, two requirements must be fulfilled: i) the protein of interest tagged with the appropriate bap sequence, and ii) the biotin protein ligase expressed within the secretory compartment, i.e. the endoplasmic reticulum .

in all our constructs we have used the bap sequence glndifeaqkiewhe, fused to either the n- or the c-terminus of the protein. the cdna of the bira enzyme was engineered by adding at the 5' end a sequence encoding a secretion signal leader peptide  <cit>  to allow translocation of the enzyme into the er . for in vivo biotinylation of proteins within the secretory pathway in mammalian cells, we initially co-transfected two plasmids encoding the tagged protein of interest and the sec-bira enzyme. however, since the concomitant expression from two different plasmids was sometimes not well achieved , we constructed a single bigenic plasmid with two different and independent gene cassettes, one for the sec-bira enzyme and the other for the target protein. the two cassettes were assembled in the same and the opposite transcriptional orientation. since the relative orientation of the two transcriptional units was irrelevant to the expression and the biotinylation levels of the bap-tagged protein , we arbitrarily chose the vector with the two cassettes in the same orientation for all the different molecules tested .

we first tested our bigenic plasmid system with three different model scfvs expressed as secretory proteins that were derived from: i) mab p <dig>  specific for n-glycolyl-containing gangliosides  <cit> , ii) mab 1e <dig>  an anti-idiotype antibody specific for mab p <dig>  <cit>  and iii) mab 9e <dig>  specific for the α-chain of the human ige high affinity receptor   <cit> . culture supernatants from transiently transfected hek293t/ <dig> cells cultured in the presence of biotin, were first dialyzed to eliminate free biotin and then analyzed by western blot  in a gel retardation assay in the presence of streptavidin. the complex formed by streptavidin and biotinylated protein resists sds-page conditions and is retarded in relation to the non-biotinylated molecules that do not bind streptavidin. as shown in fig. 2a, almost all molecules of the three different scfvs were biotinylated, indicating the high efficiency of the method. for two scfvs, similar analysis was then repeated with supernatants from stably transfected hek <dig> cells showing similar biotinylation efficiency . in addition, both the expression  and the biotinylation levels of molecules remained almost identical over time, as shown with samples taken after  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> days of culture of the transfectoma expressing the scfv1e <dig> . no signs of increased cell death were observed for the different transfectomas, indicating that the expression of bira in the er is not toxic for cells.

the binding properties of the biotinylated scfvs were assayed by elisa, and for two of them also by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence assays , using cells displaying on their membranes the respective ligands. scfvp <dig> was tested on cells displaying the 1e <dig> idiotype, whereas the scfv9e <dig> was tested on rbl-sx <dig> cells that express the high affinity receptor fcεri. in both cases, a clear and ligand-specific binding of the biotinylated molecules was demonstrated using streptavidin coupled to quantum dots, which provided a stronger signal compared to streptavidin conjugated with traditional fluorophores .

we also co-expressed with sec-bira a recombinant truncated version of the human ige heavy chain protein either in its secretory or membrane bound form  <cit> , to investigate and compare the efficiency of in vivo biotinylation of the same target protein in the two different versions. retardation assays of the secretory  and membrane bound  molecules revealed that also in this case most of them were biotinylated . no differences in biotinylation levels were observed when the bap sequence was fused to the n- or the c-terminus of t-ige: indeed, in both forms the same er luminal sequence is present and they diverge in the position of the bap tag. the binding activity of the soluble biotinylated t-sige was not compromised by biotinylation, as its efficient binding to the high affinity fcεri on rbl-sx <dig> cells was clearly detected with streptavidin-quantum dots, both by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy . similarly, the membrane form t-mlige was effectively displayed on the cell surface and efficiently biotinylated, as revealed by fluorescent streptavidin binding .

finally, we also expressed the bap-tagged soluble version of the fcεri α-chain   <cit> , which became highly biotinylated and retained its ige binding activity .

we tested the feasibility of purification of one of the in vivo biotinylated scfvs, using a commercially available modified avidin with low binding affinity for biotin. as shown in figure  <dig>  the biotinylated scfv was eluted with high yield and purity, and ten times concentrated with respect to the culture supernatant.

as shown above, the ectopic localization in the er of the bira enzyme did not compromise its enzymatic activity, allowing biotinylation of both secretory and membrane proteins. as expected, biotinylation was dependent on the presence of the enzyme bira in the right compartment. in fact, only when the secreted scfv1e <dig> or t-sige were co-expressed with sec-bira, they became almost completely biotinylated, whereas no biotinylation took place either when scfv1e <dig> and t-sige were expressed alone or co-expressed with cytosolic bira . on the other hand, cytosolic bira was competent, as expected, in biotinylating a cytoplasmic localized protein, the rotavirus non-structural protein nsp <dig>  <cit>  .

discussion
the biotin-avidin/streptavidin binding is the strongest non-covalent interaction known in nature. this property is exploited as a biological tool for a wide range of applications, like purification or immunodetection of target molecules to which biotin is covalently attached. most approaches for biotinylation of molecules are based on chemical procedures, which have as a major disadvantage the lack of specifity for the biotin incorporation site. moreover, coupling reactions could modify residues that affect the three-dimensional conformation or the specific properties of the target molecule  <cit> . to overcome these limitations, the enzymatic biotinylation was introduced  <cit> . this technology was improved by the discovery of new sequence specific substrates for biotinylation enzymes that could be fused to the target molecules. some of these sequences are more than  <dig> amino acid long  <cit> , but shorter ones are also available. among the latters, a very convenient one is the  <dig> amino acid long biotin acceptor peptide , originally described by beckett et al.  <cit> , which contains a single lysine as a biotin acceptor residue. biotinylation can be obtained in vitro using proteins tagged with bap and incubated with the purified enzyme  <cit> ; alternatively, a similar strategy can be used in vivo by co-expressing the target protein and the biotin-protein ligase bira. to co-express them in mammalian cells, either a two plasmid co-transfection system has been used  <cit>  or a bicistronic plasmid based on the ires sequence  <cit> . for this strategy to be successful with proteins within the secretory pathway, the bira enzyme, which is a cytosolic protein, must be engineered in a way that allows its translocation to the er. we achieved such translocation using a validated secretory signal leader peptide from a mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain  <cit> . this was essential since the cytosolic version of bira did not sustain biotinylation of secreted proteins, while it did so very efficiently for cytosolic proteins like rotavirus nsp <dig>  although a two-plasmid system can be used, we arranged our system in a single bigenic plasmid, which was particularly useful for the selection of stable transfectomas co-expressing both proteins, and able to sustain high levels of biotinylation. in addition, cell viability was not compromised, allowing the continuous production of the biotinylated molecule of interest.

here we have shown the effective in vivo biotinylation of different recombinant molecules of immunological interest. however, this strategy can be applied to any other protein within the secretory pathway. the simple method we used to induce bira-driven high efficient biotinylation was effective for a number of different secretory and membrane bound proteins, with the bap tag positioned both at the c- and n-terminus. fusion of the bap peptide neither caused intracellular accumulation nor compromised secretion of the scfvs . we have also observed biotinylation of other proteins with bap inserted in defined structural internal loops .

in order to get biotinylation strictly dependent on exogenously added biotin, cells must be cultured in biotin-free medium and dialyzed serum. this is an attractive aspect of the technology, because it allows performing biotin pulse-labelling, as well as production of non-biotinylated bap-tagged proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
this methodology provides many possibilities of application. biotinylated molecules obtained by transfection of cells with the single bigenic plasmid can be simply recovered and easily purified from the culture supernatants or cell lysates using commercially available reagents, like beads with covalently immobilised monomeric avidin, from which bound proteins can be eluted using free biotin. furthermore, biotinylated membrane bound proteins can be easily detected on the surface of cells with streptavidin conjugated with different fluorophores, including quantum dots . moreover, culture supernatants containing biotinylated secreted proteins can be directly used without further purification in a number of different immunochemical techniques, such as western blot, elisa, immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry.
