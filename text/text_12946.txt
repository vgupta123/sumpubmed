BACKGROUND
fgfs constitute a superfamily of pleiotropic growth factors involved in multiple cellular processes such as mitogenesis, angiogenesis and mesoderm induction  <cit> . there are  <dig> fgfs in humans. except fgf11- <dig>  they exert their biological activities by acting as extracellular growth factors binding to receptors  of the tyrosine kinase receptor superfamily  <cit> . in addition, fgf1- <dig> and fgf11- <dig> are localized in the nucleus and function intracellularly  <cit> . intracellular fgfs bind to several proteins that play a role in fgf trafficking: fibp, which allows fgf <dig> to shuttle between the cytosol and the nucleus  <cit> , synaptotagmin- <dig>  which allows fgf <dig> exocytosis  <cit> , cystein rich fgf receptor , which forms complexes with various fgfs and allows their secretion  <cit> , and lrp- <dig> and  <dig> , which in conjunction with dab- <dig>  regulate egl-17/fgf export in c. elegans  <cit> . fgf interactors may also regulate fgf nuclear activity; this is the case of casein kinase ii regulatory subunits  <cit>  and splicing factor sf3a <dig>  <cit> , which both interact with fgf <dig>  finally, proteins of the extracellular matrix such as fibstatin and fibrinogen interact with fgf <dig>  <cit> .

let- <dig> is one of the two fgfs of c. elegans . it is essential for worm development  <cit> . like some mammalian fgfs, it acts both intra and extracellularly. the molecular motif allowing secretion  <cit>  and some of let- <dig> extracellular functions have been described  <cit>  but the intracellular functions remain poorly defined, although nuclear localization is probably of importance  <cit> . to further characterize the functions of let- <dig>  we used yeast two-hybrid screens to identify proteins that interact with this fgf. we identified several interacting proteins involved in various developmental processes or in basic biochemical events such as ribosome biogenesis, and validated some of the interactions by co-immunoprecipitation and/or colocalization.

RESULTS
identification of nematode let- <dig> binding proteins by yeast two-hybrid library screens
to identify worm proteins that interact with let- <dig>  we used the two-hybrid system in the mav <dig> yeast with let- <dig> fused to the gal- <dig> dna binding domain  as bait and two c. elegans libraries. the latter were either normalized  <cit>  to contain one representative of each expressed gene of the whole genome  or derived from a mixed stage worm population. library clones were coupled to the gal- <dig> activating domain . the bait did not show any intrinsic transcriptional activation of the three yeast reporter genes. in a screen of approximately  <dig> ×  <dig> transformants,  <dig> clones were positive for the two reporters tested, or for only one reporter but with great intensity. the gap repair technique confirmed  <dig> clones . sequencing of these clones and blastn or tblastx interrogation of databases revealed unidentified sequences  and sequences coding for proteins with known functions: ump synthase, an enzyme involved in de novo nucleic acid synthesis, cathepsin , rps- <dig> , transcription factor pal- <dig> involved in the anterior-posterior development of the male  <cit> , daf- <dig>  a chaperone of the hsp- <dig> family, involved in chemosensory transduction and insulin signalization  <cit> , col- <dig>  an isoform of collagen, and skr- <dig> , a component of the skp1p/cullin/f-box scf complex with ubiquitin ligase activity  <cit> . the latter also shows similarities with p <dig>  which is associated with cyclina/cdk <dig> complex in humans.

to confirm the results on some on the interactors we judged potentially relevant, pad interactor clones were picked individually from the orfeome library and tested directly in yeast two-hybrid system against pdb let- <dig>  pal- <dig> interacted strongly with let- <dig> . for the other interactors, only one test was clearly positive .

identification of let-756-binding proteins among orthologs of known mammalian fgf interactors
the conservation of signaling pathways between worms and mammals, as well as the conserved fgf structures in different species  <cit> , suggested that orthologs of human fgf-binding proteins could interact with let- <dig>  we used blast interrogation to determine the most conserved orthologs supposed to retain the ancestral function of the known human fgf-interactors. these orthologs were recovered from the orfeome library and tested in binary interactions . we found kin- <dig>  and rpl- <dig> positive for two reporter genes, and kin- <dig> , hsp- <dig> , f14e <dig>   and c18a <dig>   positive for one reporter gene.

identification of human let-756-binding proteins
we based our third approach on the assumption that protein interaction motifs may be conserved between species. we made a heterologous screen using a cdna human library as prey and let- <dig> as bait. the yeast two-hybrid system was used with let- <dig> fused to lexa dna binding domain as bait  for the screening of a human placenta cdna library containing the gal- <dig> activating domain . table  <dig> indicates the number of times the interactors were isolated and the strength of the interaction. identified partners were different from those unveiled by the c. elegans screens but showed similar biologic activities . mbd <dig> and zn <dig> are transcription factors, 14-3-3β  has chaperone activity, and fbli <dig>  is a protein of the zyxin family.

finally, the orthologs of human 14-3-3β , ftt-1/par- <dig> and ftt- <dig>  and the orthologs of fbl <dig>  zyx-1a and zyx-1b, were obtained from the nematode orfeome library and tested for direct interaction in yeast two-hybrid system. table 2c indicates that ftt- <dig> and ftt- <dig>  but not zyx-1a or zyx-1b, reacted with the let- <dig> bait.

confirmation of interactions by co- immunoprecipitation experiments
a number of interactors we identified have been described as false positives in various studies. it is the case for hsp family members and ribosomal proteins, and to some extent for collagen-related proteins, zn finger proteins and proteasome subunits  <cit> . to validate the interaction of let- <dig> with the candidate partners, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were done in cos- <dig> cells. cos- <dig> cells were transiently cotransfected with ha-tagged partner constructs and let-756::gfp, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-gfp. fig.  <dig> shows the result of a western blot probed first with anti-ha to reveal the co-immunoprecipitated proteins, and second with anti-gfp to normalize the transfection with let- <dig>  all tested partners immunoprecipitated with let- <dig>  although with different strength, unrelated to their level of expression . the 14-3-3β and kin- <dig> proteins were reproducibly the less efficient. to make sure that overexpression of the two tagged proteins was not responsible for the immunoprecipitation, we used tacc <dig> as an unrelated ha-tagged control. in similar condition, tacc <dig> was unable to immunoprecipitate let- <dig> 

confirmation of interactions by subcellular colocalization experiments
to further confirm fgf/partner interaction in mammalian cells, ha-tagged partners were co-expressed with let-756::gfp in cos- <dig> cells and their respective subcellular localization was examined. as already described  <cit> , let-756::gfp localized in specific regions of the nucleus where splicing factors are concentrated. immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-ha antibodies revealed pal- <dig> in foci in the nucleus that colocalized with let- <dig> . we have previously established  <cit>  that treatment of let- <dig> expressing cells with actinomycin d  displaces let- <dig> to the perinucleolar and nucleolar compartments. addition of actinomycin d did not move the pal- <dig> protein to the nucleolus as it did for let- <dig> but kept both partners in close association in nucleoplasmic foci. other partners, such as rpl- <dig>  were delocalized by transfection of let- <dig>  rpl- <dig> was localized in large foci mainly in the nucleoplasm when transfected alone  but was most often dispersed through the nucleoplasm and associated with let- <dig> when cotransfected with the fgf . ftt-1/par- <dig> and ftt- <dig> localized preferentially in the cytoplasm when transfected alone, but observed also in the nucleus when transfected together with let- <dig>  in addition, vesicles containing both let- <dig> and ftt- <dig> or ftt- <dig> were visible. kin- <dig> colocalized with let- <dig> in nuclei and exhibited a strong expression in cytoplasm whether let- <dig> was present or not whereas kin- <dig> present in nucleoplasm of untransfected let- <dig> cells moved with let- <dig> in the speckles when co-transfected. upon actinomycin d treatment both let- <dig> and kin- <dig> formed enlarged speckles and moved to the nucleolus . this stricking delocalization observed upon actinomycin d treated kin- <dig> co-transfected cells did not occurred with kin- <dig>  in other instances, the partner modified let- <dig> localization: rps- <dig> concentrated let- <dig> in large foci when both proteins were present in the nucleus . the protein encoded by c15c <dig>  did not show any gross colocalization . finally, col- <dig> was localized only at the golgi apparatus, whether let- <dig> was present or not, and cfr was localized only in the cytoplasm.

discussion
several growth factors are found in the nucleus in addition to their other localizations. this is the case for let- <dig> but not for egl- <dig>  the other c. elegans fgf  <cit> . the role of let- <dig> in the nucleus is not known. to help characterize this role we searched to identify intracellular binding partners of let- <dig>  by using different two-hybrid screens in yeast, we identified several proteins involved in various aspects of protein synthesis or degradation. further analysis by co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization confirmed the interactions identified. we demonstrated that not only let- <dig> could interact with mammalian partners as well as their orthologs  but also that orthologs of mammalian fgf partners could interact with let- <dig> . analyses of these partners could be of interest in the study of mammalian fgfs.

the majority of the proteins we identified are nuclear, which was expected since the two-hybrid system needs the fusion to be targeted to the nucleus. however, some interactions have been identified as false positive in other screens  <cit> . by performing co-immunoprecipitations and studying subcellular localization, we validated the interaction of let- <dig> with rps- <dig>  ftt-1/par- <dig>  ftt- <dig>  kin- <dig> and rpl- <dig> with high score, and with pal- <dig>  daf- <dig>  skr- <dig>  kin- <dig> and c18a <dig>  with lower strength . the function of some interacting partners is relevant to fgf biology. the 14-3-3/ftt-1/ftt- <dig> proteins, which belong to the highly conserved family of chaperone molecules transit to the nucleus and participate in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, regulating intracellular transduction  <cit> . we did not find a 14-3- <dig> conventional phosphorylated binding site on let- <dig>  however, other domains have been involved in 14-3- <dig> binding, such as nuclear localization signals . no role for ftt- <dig> or ftt- <dig> in modulating secretion has been assigned in c. elegans. it will be interesting to analyze whether interaction of these proteins with the efvsva motif of secretion described in let- <dig>  <cit>  causes its secretion. the interaction of let- <dig> with pal- <dig> is of interest because pal- <dig> is also highly conserved during evolution. it is the ortholog of caudal , cdx <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and xcad <dig>  parahox proteins. caudal proteins are involved in the transcriptional regulation of multiple genes that are involved in posterior patterning  <cit> . the interaction of let- <dig> with pal- <dig> could activate the expression of various genes involved in nematode anterior-posterior development as it is the case for the interaction of xenopus e-fgf with xcad <dig> and the resulting activation of hox genes  <cit> . in addition, pal- <dig> mutant exhibits aberrant cell position in posterior muscle cells  <cit> , a site of let- <dig> expression  <cit>  as well as in posterior hypodermis, a site of let- <dig> action  <cit> . both muscle and epidermis evolve from the c lineage. in the absence of pal- <dig>  the c blastomeres fail to develop. protein phosphorylation by the coordinated activities of protein kinases and phosphatases is central to many signal transduction pathways. the combined action of let-756/fgf, egl- <dig> receptor, clr- <dig> phosphatase  and kin- <dig> and kin- <dig>  the respective catalytic and regulatory subunits of ck <dig>  might regulate various processes involved in proliferation -as it is described for fgf <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  – or in other functions. kin- <dig> and kin- <dig> have been recently implicated in primary cilia biology  <cit> . finally, some ribosomal proteins interact with mammalian fgf  <cit>  to regulate their signaling and trafficking to the nucleus; reciprocally, fgfs may regulate ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis during the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle. in contrast to these relevant interactors, others appear irrelevant, such as mbd <dig> since no methylation occurs in c. elegans.

the interactions revealed by the two-hybrid screens are rather weak. this could be due to 1) the high stringency associated with the system using the mav 103/ <dig> yeast strains; it is worth noting that in large-scale screenings of interactions no partner for let- <dig> was found  <cit> ; 2) a bad exposure of the binding site in the fusion proteins; 3) the existence of ternary interactions as seen in the ligand – tyrosine kinase receptor – heparan sulphate complex and 4) the need for post-translational modifications of the proteins that occur in mammalian cells and not in yeast, explaining why better interactions between glycosylated let- <dig>  <cit>  and various partners were obtained in immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments than in yeast two-hybrid screens.

finally, it will be interesting to know whether the expression pattern of let- <dig>  which is mainly muscular and neuronal in the worm, overlap with that of the various partners. search in the literature  was not conclusive since the majority of the partners were found in eggs , intestine  or cuticle .

CONCLUSIONS
we have conducted the first extensive search for let- <dig> interactors and established the first interaction map of let-756/fgf with fgf binding proteins . this could help understand fgf functions. proteins of interest were involved in developmental processes or in basic biochemical events such as ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. in addition, to get insight in the evolution of the fgf interactome network, which we have illustrated in fig.  <dig>  we tested  <dig> of  <dig> orthologs of human fgf interactors , and found kin- <dig> and rpl- <dig> as new potential interactors. looking for physical interactions in a physiological system will determine which of these interactions are essential.

in conclusion, 1) combining the yeast two-hybrid screen with bioinformatics and computational biology, we have delineated potential interactors of let- <dig>  and possibly of the entire fgf family; 2) comparative genomics analysis yielded valuable insights into conserved and divergent aspects of function, regulation, and evolution since not all pathways are conserved as demonstrated by the ortholog analysis; 3) the information given herein, although not complete, might be useful for people working in the field.
