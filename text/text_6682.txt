BACKGROUND
detection of circulating tumor cells  in blood and disseminated tumor cells  in the bone marrow and/or lymph nodes, which are thought to be responsible for metastases, may allow a better prediction of the individual prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer  <cit> . recent studies of our group indicated that the molecular detection of ctc and dtc in patients with colorectal cancer  may be of prognostic value  <cit> . furthermore, immunomagnetic enrichment strategies have been developed to improve the detection and yield of ctc and dtc  <cit> . a large number of monoclonal antibodies  against the epithelial cell adhesion molecule  which is expressed only in epithelium and malignant tumors derived from epithelia have been increasingly used to enrich and isolate ctc from blood and dtc from bone marrow samples  <cit> . however, there are no data available comparing antibodies against various epcam epitopes for immunomagnetic isolation of ctc with regard to their sensitivity and specificity. therefore, it remains unclear if all anti-epcam antibodies are able to detect and to capture the same range of ctc and if they have the same clinical and prognostic impact. furthermore, it is still unknown which method of sample preparation and cell extraction is most suitable for immunomagnetic enrichment and detection of ctc.

in this study, we aimed to compare two different specific antibodies against the epitope in the egf-like domain i of epcam for immunomagnetic enrichment and subsequent detection of ctc in crc patients. we used commercially available immunomagnetic beads coated with mab berep <dig>  <cit>  and magnetic beads coated with mab ks1/ <dig>  <cit> . both monoclonal antibodies recognize specific epitopes of the extracellular domain of the epcam molecule. mab berep <dig> recognizes two  specific antigens, whereas mab ks1/ <dig> recognizes one  specific antigen of the extracellular domain of the epcam molecule  <cit> . furthermore, we examined the effect of two different cell extraction protocols on subsequent immunomagnetic enrichment and detection of tumor cells in the blood.

RESULTS
specificity of the enrichment and extraction protocols
both whole blood and mnc fractions of five healthy donors were tested regarding the specificity of cell extraction and enrichment protocols with immunomagnetic beads coated with berep <dig> and ks1/ <dig>  no ck <dig> signal was observed in all examined blood samples of healthy donors, demonstrating the specificity of the used assays.

sensitivity of the enrichment and extraction protocols
whole blood
in the tumor cell spiking experiments with whole blood samples the sensitivity of the ck <dig> rt-pcr assay was higher using immunomagnetic beads coated with mab ks1/ <dig> compared to precoated mab berep <dig> dynabeads. in serial dilution assays, a minimum number of  <dig> ht <dig> cells could be detected in  <dig> ml whole blood using the berep <dig> mab whereas  <dig> ht <dig> cells could be detected in the same volume using the ks1/ <dig> mab.

mononuclear cell fraction
extraction of mnc fraction with ficoll gradient centrifugation prior to immunomagnetic enrichment of blood samples spiked with ht <dig> cells resulted in a higher sensitivity of the ck <dig> rt-pcr assay.  <dig> ht <dig> cells spiked in  <dig> ml blood  could be detected after isolation of the mnc fraction using the mab berep <dig> dynabeads, whereas  <dig> ht <dig> cells spiked in  <dig> ml blood  were detected using the mab ks1/ <dig> coated beads.

blood spiking experiments were repeated several times to confirm the above mentioned results.

the observed higher sensitivity of tumor cell detection after isolation of the mnc fraction prior to immunomagnetic ctc enrichment prompted us to generally use ficoll gradient centrifugation before further immunomagnetic enrichment and detection of ctc in the blood of crc patients.

detection of tumor cells in blood samples of crc patients
median age of included crc patients was  <dig> years  with  <dig> females and  <dig> males. eighteen of  <dig>  patients presented with metastatic disease to the liver and were classified as uicc stage iv;  <dig> patients were uicc stage iii, and  <dig> patients stage uicc ii and i. clinical data of the patients are shown in table  <dig> 

*abbreviations: iort: intraoperative radiotherapy; f: female; m: male; pat. no.: patients number.

using two different antibodies  for immunomagnetic enrichment, ctc were detected in  <dig> of  <dig>  patients with crc. among these, immunomagnetic enrichment with mab berep <dig> beads accounted for  <dig> ck <dig> positive patients. immunomagnetic enrichment using mab ks1/ <dig> beads showed  <dig> ck <dig> positive patients. interestingly, there were no blood samples being ck  <dig> positive for both used antibodies .

ck <dig> pcr transcripts were detected in  <dig> of  <dig>  blood samples from uicc stage iv patients after immunomagnetic enrichment with mab ks1/ <dig> coated beads. when mab berep <dig> beads were used, we also observed positive ck <dig> products in  <dig> of  <dig>  uicc stage iv patients. among the  <dig> patients with uicc stage iii,  <dig> patients showed ck <dig> positive samples after enrichment of ctc with berep <dig> beads only. positive ck <dig> signals were observed in  <dig> of  <dig> patients with uicc stage i after enrichment with ks1/ <dig> coated beads only . furthermore, among  <dig> patients with uicc stage ii no samples were found positive for ck <dig> using either berep <dig> or ks1/ <dig> coated beads.

discussion
the first phase of the metastatic process of malignant epithelial tumors consists of local tumor cell migration, followed by tumor cell dissemination in the blood, invasion and homing to secondary distant organs  <cit> . despite recent developments of various therapeutic approaches, distant metastases represent the major cause of death in patients with colorectal cancer  <cit> . theoretically, postoperative metastatic recurrence should develop from isolated tumor cells or micrometastases already existing at time of surgery or they can derive from tumor cells that are hematogenously shed into circulation during surgical procedures. thus, a reliable detection method for ctc in a small volume of peripheral blood might be of high interest to improve staging and to more accurately predict patients' individual prognosis. to increase the specificity of tumor cell detection, immunomagnetic beads labeled with an epithelium-specific monoclonal antibody  haven been used to isolate ctc from blood  <cit> .

to our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the use of mab ks1/ <dig> coated beads to isolate ctc from crc patients. the sensitivity of the ks1/ <dig> coated bead system was evaluated by ht <dig> tumor cell dilution experiments and reproducibly allowed the detection of about  <dig> ht <dig> cells spiked in  <dig> ml blood. in our reference experiments, mab ks1/ <dig> retrieved  <dig> fold more tumor cells than the commonly used mab berep <dig> precoated beads  after mnc gradient enrichment.

our study also confirmed the study from guo et al. which showed better results for mnc population extraction prior to immunomagnetic isolation of tumor cells than the immunomagnetic isolation of circulating tumor cells from whole blood  <cit> . guo et al. combined immunomagnetic isolation followed by real-time rt-pcr to detect ctc in patients with colorectal cancer. this study showed that combining negative  and positive  immunomagnetic selection successively yields a high amount of ctc . as they used cea as marker gene in their analyses, the authors did not assess the cytokeratin expression of the ctc, which is in our opinion the most widely used marker for ctc  <cit> . moreover, negative enrichment with cd <dig> depletion of leucocytes may lead to a theoretical "loss" of ctc as they could stick together with the leucocytes-beads complexes. denis et al. demonstrated ctc in whole blood samples in  <dig> of  <dig> patients with metastatic crc using mab berep coated magnetic beads and subsequent analysis with rt-pcr assays for ck <dig>  ck <dig> and ck <dig> gene expression  <cit> . however, the previously described epithelial and tumor markers can also be expressed in normal peripheral blood leukocytes normally present in whole blood which may lead to false positive results  <cit> . using spiking experiments with healthy donor blood vlems et al. demonstrated that differences in sample handling and assay sensitivity influence ck <dig> detection in blood  <cit> . in the present study, isolation of ctc from crc patients was only performed in the mnc population after ficoll-gradient enrichment. in addition, ficoll-gradients purge the mnc fraction from granulocytes, which constitutively express ck <dig> mrna  <cit> . this is in accordance with our results as our nested rt-pcr retrieved consistently negative ck <dig> results in blood samples from healthy donors. automated systems for immunomagnetic ctc isolation and subsequent immunocytochemical detection are nowadays available and usually rely on the principle of epcam based enrichment methods. using the cell search system  cohen et al. demonstrated the prognostic value of ctc enumeration in the peripheral blood of metastatic crc patients  <cit> . future studies are needed to examine and compare the detection rates and prognostic differences between pcr based and immunocytochemical tumor cell detection methods after immunomagnetic enrichment of ctc.

berep <dig> and ks1/ <dig> are high affinity and specific mab frequently used to detect epcam positive cells. interestingly, we noted that ck <dig> rt-pcr products were commonly not found in both samples when analyzing blood of the same patient after enrichment with either mab berep <dig> or mab ks/ <dig>  other authors have already described heterogeneity in reactivity of epcam specific antibodies. balzar et al. suggested that different conformational states of the cell surface epcam protein might hide some epitopes leading to subpopulations of epcam and thus heterogeneous affinity  <cit> .

successful ctc enrichment depends on the level of epcam expression in the target cell  <cit> . furthermore, downregulation of cytokeratins in tumor derived cell lines and cytokeratin negative ctc have also been reported in patients with breast cancer  <cit> . these findings might hinder the adequate detection of ctc. promising results for the detection of ck <dig> positive ctc in colorectal cancer patients were shown by wong et al  <cit>  by blocking the fc region of the anti-berep <dig> antibody with a goat anti-mouse antibody during immunomagnetic enrichment. using this refined immunomagnetic enrichment method wong et al. could demonstrate a specific detection of colorectal ctc in vitro and they confirmed the clinical significance of their results in large series of colorectal cancer patients  <cit> .

the dissimilar capture of ctc by berep <dig> and ks1/ <dig> mabs in our analysis might be explained by various expression of the epcam molecule among the examined patients. nevertheless, our ks1/ <dig> system was able to retrieve  <dig> fold more ctc compared to the berep <dig> system. the use of different epcam clones might enhance the detection rate of ctc. additional investigations to assess the variations of epcam molecule expression among different patients will be of critical importance to identify a panel of suitable mabs which could be used for efficient and reliable ctc isolation.

our results also demonstrate that ficoll-gradient isolation is a decisive step prior to the immunomagnetic enrichment of ctc from peripheral blood.

CONCLUSIONS
our study for the first time shows that isolation and detection of ctc with immunomagnetic enrichment methods is critically dependent on the used epcam clone. further analysis regarding the clinical importance of heterogenous expression of the epcam molecule in ctc of crc patients is urgently needed.
