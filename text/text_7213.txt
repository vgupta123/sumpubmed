BACKGROUND
fungal β-n-acetylhexosaminidases catalyze the hydrolysis of chitobiose into its constituent monosaccharides. these enzymes are physiologically important during the life cycle of the fungus for the formation of septa, germ tubes and fruit-bodies  <cit> . these processes are important in control of fungal and insect pests  <cit>  and are relevant to human diseases  <cit> , lending considerable interest in the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes. the enzymes are also used in chemoenzymatic synthesis of biologically interesting oligosaccharides based on their effective transglycosylation of β-glcnac and β-galnac  <cit> .

crystal structures are known for several β-n-acetylhexosaminidases from the glycohydrolase  <dig> family including the monomeric bacterial enzymes from serratia marcescens  <cit>  and streptomyces plicatus  <cit> . the catalytic domain of β-n-acetylhexosaminidase is an α/β tim-barrel. crystallization with substrate analogs showed the conserved residues asp539-glu <dig> to be close to the binding site and thus predict them to play a key role in chitobiose hydrolysis with glu <dig> acting as a proton donor to the substrate, while asp <dig> restrains its acetamido group in a specific orientation by hydrogen bonding with n <dig> of the nonreducing sugar  <cit> . β-n-acetylhexosaminidase from streptomyces plicatus has been co-crystallized with the cyclic intermediate analogue n-acetylglucosamine-thiazoline. the pyranose ring of the analogue is bound in the active site in a conformation close to that of a 4c <dig> chair. within the substrate-binding pocket, tyr <dig> and asp <dig> appear important for positioning the 2-acetamido group of the substrate for nucleophilic attack at the anomeric center and for dispersing the positive charge distributed into the oxazolinium ring upon cyclization  <cit> . experiments with two mutated forms of the enzyme  provided evidence that asp <dig> stabilizes the transition states, and assists to correctly orient the 2-acetamido group for catalysis  <cit> . recently, the structure of dimeric human lysosomal β-n-acetylhexosaminidase has been solved providing new insight into the mechanism of sandhoff disease  <cit> . most mutations associated with late-onset sandhoff disease reside near the subunit interface, and are thus proposed to interfere with the correct formation of the enzyme dimer  <cit> .

the fungal β-n-acetylhexosaminidases are robust enzymes commonly used in our laboratories in chemoenzymatic syntheses of oligosaccharides  <cit> . we have previously reported the remarkable inducibility of a fungal β-n-acetylhexosaminidase from aspergillus oryzae by glcnac  <cit> . this enzyme was purified to homogeneity from the culture medium, and its sequence was determined using both direct protein sequencing and dna sequencing of a genomic clone containing the hexa gene  <cit> . in the present work, to initiate structural studies of this enzyme we performed sequence alignment and homology modeling, and constructed a molecular model of the enzyme and of its complex with the natural substrate chitobiose and with its non-cleavable analog glcnacβ1→4mannac  <cit> . several experimental approaches provide experimental verification of the overall features suggested by the model. disulfide bridging, secondary structure, and the mode of subunit assembly were determined experimentally and correlated with the model. we also constructed a model of the n-glycosylated enzyme, and compared it with kinetic properties of the native and deglycosylated enzymes.

RESULTS
molecular models of β-n-acetylhexosaminidase
we have used the primary structure of the fungal β-n-acetylhexosaminidase determined in our laboratory  <cit>  to perform homology modeling using the solved structures of these enzymes from serratia marcescens  <cit> , streptomyces plicatus  <cit>  and homo sapiens  <cit> . alignment of the amino acid sequences of the fungal enzyme and these three structurally solved enzymes reveals both areas of extensive amino acid similarity and segments that appear unique to the fungal enzyme . the shown alignment is the result of a combination of a structural alignment of the three crystal structures and the sequence alignment generated with clustalx, to exclude misalignment in sequence variable regions, as especially the chitobiase from serratia marcescens has additional domains. starting from this alignment we created a structural model of the catalytic subunit including the small n-terminal zincin-like domain using a restraint-based comparative modeling approach. in this model we grouped the six cysteins into three pairs according to the closest distance. the three cysteine pairs cys290-cys <dig>  cys448-cys <dig> and cys583-cys <dig> were adjusted into the model by repeating the modeling procedure with the additional restraints as an input for modeller. the final model had  <dig> % of residues in the most favored regions of the ramachandran plot and an acceptable overall geometry, both determined with the procheck program. the overall g-factor of the structure obtained showed a value of - <dig> . the g-factor tries to quantify the overall geometry and its value should be above - <dig> ; values below - <dig>  may indicate a wrong structure. with respect to the general shortcomings of homology modelling especially in the loop and sequence variable regions, we decided to solvate the homology structure in spc water to refine it by  <dig> ns of molecular dynamics in a npt ensemble. according to the root mean square deviation of the cα atoms the structure gets after  <dig> ns into an equilibrium state oscillating around a fixed value with a deviation of ±  <dig>  Å. the resulting catalytic subunit has a kidney-shaped structure with approximate dimensions of  <dig>  ×  <dig>  ×  <dig>  nm . all amino acids involved in catalysis are concentrated in the central tim barrel, with the catalytic glutamic acid on the upper border . an overlay with the corresponding amino acids of the three template structures with our final model shows that their position is conserved among the available structures and that the active site in our model structure was stable during the molecular dynamics refinement of the overall structure .

docked into the binding site, the natural substrate n, n'-diacetylchitobiose, participates in the hydrogen bonding between asp <dig> and tyr <dig> with the acetamido group of the non-reducing glcnac moiety. the non-reducing end of the disaccharide is locked into the active site owing to the hydrogen bonds of arg <dig>  asp <dig>  trp <dig> and glu <dig> with the c <dig> and c <dig> oh groups. the reducing end of the disaccharide is stabilized by a π-π interaction with the aromatic ring of trp <dig>  after the substrate being docked and the complex being solvated it shows an initial equilibration phase with rather high fluctuations of the observed binding energies and quite large changes in root mean square deviation of the binding site residues . however, after  <dig>  ns of md simulation the system seems to have established the binding energy gets stable with only minor fluctuation and the root mean square deviation of the binding site residues arrives back at a stable value for each of the residues that corresponds to the concrete amino acids rigidity . the mean value of the binding energy over the time interval from  <dig>  ns to  <dig> ns is  <dig>  kj/mol . the root mean square fluctuation of the protein is measured during the last  <dig> ns of the  <dig> ns md simulation, as the structure is at that time already several nanoseconds in a equilibrium state. figure  <dig> shows all active site residues belonging to the less flexible part of the protein with minimum fluctuation in time. the root mean square fluctuation of arg <dig>  tyr <dig>  asp <dig> and trp <dig> describes these residues as the most rigid part of the protein and thus these amino acids should play the key role for substrate specificity. asp <dig> and the catalytic residue glu <dig> show a little less rigidity which can be interpreted that they must be able to orient themselves to the o-glycosidic bond after substrate binding.

since initial biochemical characterization of β-n-acetylhexosaminidase from aspergillus oryzae indicated it to be a dimer, we used the physiologically relevant dimeric crystal structure of human β-n-acetylhexosaminidase  <cit>   to model the dimeric fungal enzyme according to the physiolocially valid dimerization interface i found in the crystal structure . similar like in crystal structure of human β-n-acetylhexosaminidase, the proposed dimer interface is formed mainly by loop regions at the c-terminal face of the 8-barrel, as is the active site. furthermore, the large flexible loop residues anchored by the disulphide bridge of cys <dig> with cys <dig>  an exclusive feature of the fungal enzymes, contributes to the dimer interface.

detailed examination of the dimer contact surface reveals a buried surface area per monomer of  <dig> Å <dig> and  <dig> residues containing atoms closer than  <dig>  Å to atoms of the interface partner with  <dig> residues being hydrophobic . we were able to identify  <dig> hydrogen bonds between both monomers, with the first monomer accepting  <dig> and donating  <dig>  the presence of two arg, three his, three glu and  <dig> asp explains the importance of ionic interactions between of arg and his residues of one subunit and asp and glu residues of the opposite subunit. the model thus indicates that the β-n-acetylhexosaminidase dimer may be a reversible function of ph, with acidic environments favoring dissociation into subunits. indeed, down to ph <dig>  the enzyme exists exclusively in the dimeric form, but at ph <dig>  it exists only as monomeric, but enzymatically active, subunits as revealed by gel filtration and enzyme assay  <cit> . when the dissociated enzyme is titrated back to ph <dig> , after a short incubation the dimer forms to the original extent  <cit> . this result also indicates contact areas that are easily re-established depending on the ionization state of residues with pka values near ph <dig>  the role of the ionic pairs of the above type in the formation the dimeric structure of hexosaminidases is well established. in human hexosaminidase b there is asp494-arg <dig> at the interface between the catalytic subunits in the dimer  <cit>  . notably, since in human hexosaminidases the dimerization is essential for the full catalytic activitity, mutations in the above "interface" amino acids are among the well documented human mutations that have been found in the less severe  forms of sandhoff  <cit>  and tay-sachs  <cit>  diseases. interestingly, in the dimeric structure the large flexible loop of the opposite monomer is about  <dig> nm above the c-terminal face of the 8-barrel, and the active site giving the impression of a substrate binding site lid .

six putative sites of n-glycosylation are present in the primary structure of the fungal enzyme  <cit> . digestion of β-n-acetylhexosaminidase with n-glycanase results in significant mobility shift on sds-page , indicating that one or more glycosylation sites are used on the secreted enzyme. in order to reveal the details of these important structural modifications, we have performed a detailed analysis of the actual occupaccy of all these sites using the standard n-glycanase/h218o technique  <cit>  and mass spectrometry which revealed that all six sites of n-glycosylation were indeed used in the actual hexosaminidase preparation. this conclusion was further supported by complete proteolytic digestion of hexosaminidase followed by isolation of the glycopeptides on immobilized plant lectin concanavalin a, and identification by these glycopeptides by mass spectrometry. glycopeptides that covered all six sites of n-glycosylation could be identified on the mass spectra .

the fact that all the glycopeptides described above could be efficiently recovered on the immobilized concanavalin a provided a strong indication for the high-mannose type oligosaccharides being present at the individual n-glycosylation sequences. in order to support this indication, the oligosaccharides were released by n-glycanase and analyzed using a combination of dionex oligosaccharide profiling, exoglycosidase digestion, and mass spectrometry as described in the experimental section. when we performed this analysis on oligosaccharides released from the entire hexosaminidase, we obtained the overall glycosylation of the entire enzyme indicating the hexamannosyl oligosaccharide m <dig> as the predominant structure . this overall glycosylation profile was very similar to the one we found on the two particular sites of glycosylation asn <dig> and asn <dig> . as the experimental results show a m <dig> structure as the predominant oligosaccharide, we choose this structure as the oligosaccharide to be attached to the molecular model of β-n-acetylhexosaminidase. in order to get a preliminary insight into the structural arrangement, and possible biological role of n-glycans in the fungal β-n-acetylhexosaminidase, we have sterically fitted and covalently linked the most prevalent  oligosaccharide to each site of glycosylation on our model structure. this gave rise to the model of a fully glycosylated enzyme shown as the most prevalent glycoform in fig. 2c. although the analysis of the actual glycoforms would be a much more demanding task, the model shown in fig. 2c illustrates nicely the surface exposure of the individual oligosaccharides protecting the enzyme dimer from the effects of the extracellular environment.

evidence for the status of cysteines using protein chemistry and mass spectrometry
the fungal β-n-acetylhexosaminidase is secreted into the extracellular environment, indicating the possibility for forming disulfide bonds. since there are six cysteines in the primary structure of β-n-acetylhexosaminidase, the status of their sulfhydryl groups was determined by mass spectrometry  <cit> . it has been found that the experimentally verified arrangement of the disulfide bridges corresponds exactly to that anticipated by the molecular model . moreover, these results were further confirmed by differential mapping of pepsin peptides with and without dtt reduction. using this technique reverse phase hplc identified only one peak with significant shift in the retention time. one of the components of this chromatographic peak was the peptide with m/z  <dig>  . significant decrease in its intensity with concomitant intensity increase of peaks at m/z  <dig>  and  <dig>  , observed upon addition of dtt, indicates that this peptide consists of two disulfide linked peptides. these were identified by psd measurement as peptides tyr445-phe <dig> and asn474-thr <dig> containing the cysteines  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. this confirms the identification of the disulfide bond between cys <dig> and cys <dig> 

in the model structure without disulfide bridges, cys <dig> is  <dig>  Å away from cys <dig>  the formation of the disulfide bond in the model is leading to a somewhat different position of one of the loops, easily accommodating the experimentally determined disulfide bridge with only a relatively minor change in the overall structure. as asp <dig> and trp <dig> are both amino acids forming the active site, the flexible loop between cys <dig> and cys <dig> is right beside the substrate-binding site. the behavior of this loop measured by root mean square fluctuation during the last  <dig> ns md simulation shows that it is highly flexible , which may be functionally important. the nearby disulfide bond thus stabilizes not only this loop but also the active site.

the effect of deglycosylation on enzyme activity and stability
preliminary deglycosylation experiments indicated the possibility to deglycosylate the enzyme under native conditions . we evaluated several protocols for deglycosylation using n-glycanase or endoglycosidase h under conditions compatible with optimal stability of the deglycosylated hexosaminidase . the deglycosylated enzyme remains fully active , and displays kinetic parameters indistinguishable from those of the native enzyme .

to probe the effects of deglycosylation on enzyme stability, native and deglycosylated enzymes were incubated at a range of ph values. no significant activity differences were found at alkaline or neutral ph. however, the deglycosylated enzyme is significant less stable than the native enzyme at ph values below  <dig>  the activity of the deglycosylated enzyme after incubation at ph <dig>  and  <dig>  is about 75% of the native enzyme, and at ph <dig>  the deglycosylated enzyme is only half as active as the native enzyme . this result suggests that n-linked oligosaccharides may be important for the stabilization of β-n-acetylhexosaminidase at low ph.

structure and stability determined by vibrational spectroscopy
infrared spectra of β-n-acetylhexosaminidase are characterized by two major bands at  <dig> cm- <dig>  and  <dig> cm- <dig> , associated with the amide i and ii vibrations, respectively. the position and shape of these bands are sensitive to protein conformation and secondary structure content. the second derivative, which can identify overlapping components, reveals three major bands in the amide i region. the largest component at  <dig> cm- <dig> belongs to α-helical and disordered conformations  <cit> . two other components at  <dig> cm- <dig> and  <dig> cm- <dig> are assigned to β-sheets  <cit> . the unresolved band at  <dig> cm- <dig> indicates the presence of antiparallel β-strands  <cit> , and the second part of the unresolved band at  <dig> cm- <dig> corresponds to β-turns  <cit> . characteristic side chain absorption of tyr and phe is observable at  <dig> cm- <dig> and  <dig> cm- <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the ftir spectrum of β-n-acetylhexosaminidase after deglycosylation  shows no significant shifts with respect to the native protein.

raman spectroscopy  confirms the presence of disulfide bonds by the band at  <dig> cm- <dig> due to the s-s stretching vibrations. the frequency of this band is sensitive to the local conformation of a disulfide bridge. the band at  <dig> cm- <dig> corresponds to the sulfide bridges in a conformation close to gauche-gauche-trans   <cit> . the bands in the region of stretching cs vibrations 700– <dig> cm- <dig> can be hardly resolved due to presence of three disulfide bridges and their probable flexibility with respect to ν cs vibrations. the intensity ratio of the tyrosine fermi resonance doublet  indicates that the tyrosine oh group acts as an acceptor of h-bonds suggesting that some of the tyrosines are solvent exposed  <cit> . the raman spectrum after deglycosylation  shows significant changes with respect to native protein  that are clearly revealed by the difference spectrum . almost all marker bands of aromatic side chains are affected by deglycosylation, although the secondary structure was not affected, as discussed below. thus, changes in the raman spectrum can be attributed to changes in environment of the residues, presumably due to unmasking of large surface areas of the protein by deglycosylation.

the ftir amide i and ii bands and the raman amide i band were analyzed by lsa  to quantify the secondary structure content of β-n-acetylhexosaminidase and its deglycosylated form. deglycosylation of the protein leads to small changes in secondary structure, as estimated by lsa, connected with slight decrease of β-sheets  and slight increase of α-helices – probably on the periphery of the protein. the lsa methods employs two types of α-helical structure for raman spectra: short helical segment up to eight residues called monohydrogen-bonded or disordered, and helical segments bracketed by at least four residues on each side named bihydrogen-bounded or ordered. recently we proposed that the vibrations could be affected by oligomerization or complex formation  <cit> , therefore the amount of disordered α-helix  was included to other structure in table  <dig>  if we agree with interpretation that the signal from disordered α-helix is caused mostly by dimerization of β-n-acetylhexosaminidase then carbohydrate moiety plays important role in the dimer formation. the lower stability of the deglycosylated enzyme upon prolonged incubations at acidic ph  may then be interpreted as the gradual decomposition of the enzyme dimer into the monomeric units that is fully reversible for the native but not for the deglycosylated enzyme.

discussion
we describe here results of structural analysis of dimeric, fully n-glycosylated, fungal β-n-acetylhexosaminidase isolated from the culture medium of the public collection strain of aspergillus oryzae. the unique biology  <cit>  and important biotechnological applications of this enzyme  <cit>  stimulated this work as a prerequisite for structure-function studies and enzyme engineering. to create a conceptual basis for the design of structural experiments, the amino acid sequence of the aspergillus β-n-acetylhexosaminidase determined in our laboratory  <cit>  was used to generate a molecular model of the catalytic subunit based on sequence homology to three solved β-n-acetylhexosaminidase structures  <cit> . our major experimental efforts then have been directed towards understanding the principal differences between the intracellular bacterial enzymes and the eukaryotic enzymes that have to undergo posttranslational modifications to survive better under the more aggressive conditions in lysosomes and the extracellular environment in which they function. in particular, we investigated how enzyme dimerization, disulfide bonding, and glycosylation participate in enzyme stabilization.

multimerization of enzymes represents one strategy for catalytic subunit stabilization that is often used, for example, in thermophilic organisms. consistent with this trend, the intracellular bacterial β-n-acetylhexosaminidases are monomeric whereas the extracellular secreted enzymes of fungi and humans occur as dimers. dimerization of the fungal β-n-acetylhexosaminidase appears to be a reversible process that is ph dependent. this result provides strong support for the participation of titratable functional groups at the subunit interface as predicted by the constructed dimeric structure. the experimental finding that oligosaccharide moieties may also participate in the dimerization process may represent a unique feature of the exclusively extracellular enzymes.

formation of disulfide bridges is another common way of stabilizing proteins that are secreted into the oxidative extracellular environment. the disulfide bridges detected experimentally are in complete accordance with the molecular model. one disulfide may stabilize a hinge region in a small flexible loop close to the substrate binding site. this loop is an exclusive feature of the fungal enzymes, neither present in bacterial nor mammalian structures. we hypothesize that this loop may play the role of a substrate binding site lid, as has been found previously in several enzymes including other tim barrels  <cit> , anchored by a disulfide bridge that prevents the substrate binding site from being influenced by the flexible motion of the loop. this substrate binding site lid is formed in the dimeric structure by the large flexible loop of the opposite monomer and is close above the c-terminal face of the 8-barrel, and the active site thus indicating the necessity of a functional dimer for full enzyme function.

yet another posttranslational modification known to stabilize proteins is n-glycosylation. however, experimental investigation of its role in enzyme function and stabilization is technically difficult, and only a few studies report detailed experimental analysis  <cit> . in the case studied here we had the rare possibility to fully de-n-glycosylate the enzyme under native conditions. to probe the role of extensive glycosylation in the fungal β-n-acetylhexosaminidase experimentally we used two deglycosylation methods, which are based on the use of either n-glycanase or endoglycosidase h. the former enzyme is an asparagines amidase that cleaves the n-glycosidic  bond between the asparagines and the oligosaccharide chains. this cleavage gives rise to the free β-glycosylamine, and aspartic acid that remains in the protein in the original position of the asparagines. on the other hand, the latter enzyme is a typical endoglycosidase that cleaves a glycosidic linkage between the two glcnac residues forming the chitobiose core of the n-linked oligosaccharide. such a cleavage leaves the n-glycosidic bond on asparagines, and the proximal glcnac intact.

we employed endoglycosidase h digestion which allows to efficiently remove the mannose branches while retaining the core glcnac residues to avoid the potential dangers of complete protein deglycosylation that we have previously reported  <cit> . deglycosylation had only limited effect on enzyme activity, but it significantly affected enzyme stability in acidic conditions. this role of n-glycosylation is consistent with the observation that the enzyme completely deglycosylated by n-glycanase has low stability and tends to precipitate.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have shown that complementary biochemical and biophysical methods provided structural insight into critical features of fungal β-n-acetylhexosaminidase, even in the absence of data from protein crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance. the results reported here also contain useful information for designing experiments that will use high resolution methods of protein structure analysis. dimerization of the fungal β-n-acetylhexosaminidase appears to be a reversible process that is strictly ph dependent. oligosaccharide moieties may also participate in the dimerization process which might represent a unique feature of the exclusively extracellular enzymes. deglycosylation had only limited effect on enzyme activity, but it significantly affected enzyme stability in acidic conditions. dimerization and n-glycosylation are the enzyme's strategy for catalytic subunit stabilization. one disulfide bridge, neither present in bacterial nor mammalian structures, anchors a flexible loop close to the active site that may play the role of a substrate binding site lid in the physiologically relevant dimer.
