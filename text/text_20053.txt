BACKGROUND
global climatic changes affect every continent. among the most urgent concerns we will have to face in the coming decades, the desertification, which combined to irregular rainfall intensity or frequency and extreme climatic events represent real threats for some local populations. these effects will not only impact cultivable surfaces but also limit areas where humans will be able to live, notably in developing countries where the demographic growth adds on pressure and emergency to react. in the context of sustainable development, the promotion of plants capable of growing in association with symbiotic microorganisms is of particular interest and gain increasing attention. among these, n-fixing legumes are particularly remarkable as they can develop symbiotic interactions with both bacteria  and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. overall, grain legumes contain high protein levels that can substitute the extremely high energy and water demanding animal derived protein sources that remain affordable for a great minority of humans. furthermore, their growth promotion through natural symbioses can reduce fertilizer needs thus bringing economical interest in it while limiting pollution of soils and below ground waters in a context of global warming and clean water resources impoverishment.

with the aim to promote such symbiotic legume growth in a context of global climatic changes, we have to identify symbiotic couples well adapted to a changing environment. this implies both basic and applied advances of researches on symbiosis in relation to environmental constraints. the typical rhizobium-legume symbiosis results from a complex molecular dialogue involving plant and microbial derived compounds that lead to the development of specialized root structures called nodules. in these new organs, bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonium which can then be taken up by the plant that in turn provides the bacterium with photosynthesis derived carbohydrates and a protective environment. the comprehension of molecular mechanisms involved in the establishment and functioning of these mutualistic interactions has greatly progressed during the last decade and several independent modes of infection have been identified . nevertheless, much remains to be done to decipher molecular interplay resulting in efficient symbiotic legume growth in regions subjected to a changing environment . interestingly, with recent advances in sequencing technologies, it is now possible to initiate genome wide studies on any organism that could be viewed as “models”, especially when they can be genetically manipulated. indeed, taking advantages of advances in the revolutionary next generation sequencing  technology and of basic knowledge in the symbiosis produced through extensive studies on “historical” model organisms, it is now possible for a small group to study any organism at the genome wide level. a jgi initiative to sequence whole genome of root nodule bacteria  from different biogeographical regions has led to sequencing of more than  <dig> rnbs. such structural genomic database is important for comparative and functional genomics of rnbs  <cit> . in this context, and by taking advantage of the trapping system which can, through nodule enrichment, rapidly enable isolation of symbiotic bacteria, one can now select rhizobia from any environment of interest and study them at the genome wide level. using phenotypic tests relative to their nitrogen fixation efficiency, competitivity and plant growth promotion on target legumes, their biofertilizer potential can further be tested upon inoculation which shows that both applied and basic research areas can now be simultaneously approached.

the ensifer  genus belongs to the family rhizobiaceae of alpha-proteobacteria and includes a raising number of defined species. these bacteria are rod shaped, gram negative, fast growing, motile, eps producing and can develop the symbiosis with various legumes. the host range varies however greatly with the species and depends on the symbiotic gene pool present in the microsymbiont which is mostly found on large plasmids called as psym. while some ensifer strains or species present a rather narrow host range, others have the ability to nodulate a large number of legumes such as the promiscuous rhizobial strain ngr <dig> that develops the symbiosis with at least  <dig> legume species, representing  <dig> genera  <cit> . there is need to explore such promiscuous strains from legumes growing under harsh environmental conditions. interestingly, the environment, plant species and physicochemical characteristics of soils can influence the diversity of the symbiotic microbial partners which emphasizes the need to further study rhizobial diversity from heterogeneous environments. among soil parameters, ph has been shown to play a major role in structuring the rhizobial diversity  <cit>  and appears as a major driver of the bacterial communities  <cit> . intriguingly recent studies based on multi locus sequence analyzes  have showed close proximity between ensifer strains isolated previously from desert legume shrubs  growing in the alkaline soils in the indian thar desert  <cit>  with those isolated from baja california in mexico  and merzouga in morocco  <cit>  that all share the same type of biome. surprisingly, these strains were isolated from sandy soils in baja california where wild bean had been observed  or from desert sand dune upon acacia root nodule trapping . despite the great number of sequences deposited in genbank databases that were produced from rhizobia diversity studies performed on phaseolus and acacia species, no housekeeping gene sequence identity was found outside this apparent new group of desert rhizobia. given the presence of isolates sharing the same clade on  <dig> continents that appear restricted to alkaline hot desert type of biome and the variable hosts with whom they develop effective symbioses, we decided to test whether these strains were indeed belonging to the same and yet undefined species by means of comparative genomic analyzes. using ngs as well as recent releases of comparative genomic tools and pipelines now enabling the delineation of species from genomic datasets, and rapid prediction of genes and associated functions, we sequenced the genomes of  <dig> desert rhizobial strains isolated from acacia in morocco,  <dig> strains isolated from wild bean in mexico as well as one tephrosia strain originating from the indian thar desert. these  <dig> genome sequences were combined with the sequence of another indian thar desert isolate  already released  <cit>  and compared to available genomic data from e. meliloti, e. medicae and e. fredii.

symbiotic characterization
selected strains were tested for their ability to produce nodules on their original hosts. their capacity to form nodules on other wild and cultivated legumes was also investigated using the free-draining pot method described previously  <cit> . briefly, strains were tagged with green fluorescent protein  through triparental mating  <cit>  by transferring phc <dig> plasmid carrying the gfp gene  <cit>  using the conjugation transfer machinery of helper plasmid prk <dig>  <cit> . the transformed strains were screened and purified on rhizobia defined medium   <cit>  supplemented with the antibiotics tetracycline  and streptomycin . the gfp-tagged strains were used for inoculating various legume hosts . the control and inoculated plants were maintained in the glass house. after  <dig> weeks, the inoculated plants were harvested and checked for nodulation. the expression of gfp within nodules was visualized under a fluorescent microscope  using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm.

genome sequencing, assembly and scaffold ordering
genomic dna from 50 ml exponentially growing cell cultures in ty medium was prepared following the “bacterial genomic dna isolation using ctab” procedure described by the jgi  <cit>  except that  the phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol  extraction was performed after the rnase treatment  the high molecular weight dna was recovered from the last ethanol precipitation step by fishing out the dna with glass pasteur pipette. sequencing libraries were generated using the illumina truseq dna sample preparation kit  or the nextera dna sample preparation kit  which enabled adaptor ligations of genomic dna  fragments of  <dig> or 300 bp respectively following manufacturer’s recommendations. multiplexed libraries were paired-end sequenced by  <dig> sequential runs of 100 cycles using hiseq <dig> sequencer following illumina’s recommendations on 1/ <dig> of a flow cell lane for strain lmr <dig> and 1/ <dig> of a flow cell lane for strains lmr <dig>  lem <dig>  lem <dig> and tp <dig>  image analysis and base calling were performed using the hiseq control software and real-time analysis component. demultiplexing was performed using illumina’s sequencing analysis software . the quality of the data was assessed using fastqc from the babraham institute and the illumina software sav . potential contaminants were investigated with the fastq screen software from the babraham institute. genome assembly was performed with the clc genomics workbench software  after trimming of adaptor sequences and filtering on low quality scores. scaffolds above 500 bp with an average coverage above 700×, except for lem <dig> for which a significant fraction of the scaffolds which contained notably symbiotic genes showed a mean coverage of 15×, were kept for further analyzes. for each genomic dataset, scaffolds were then ordered using the “move contigs” tool from the mauve aligner program  <cit>   as follows. first scaffolds resulting from the strain lmr <dig> genome assembly were ordered according to the complete genome of e. meliloti  <dig> with replicons in the order chromosome, psyma and psymb. the reordered scaffolds of lmr <dig> were subsequently used to order and move scaffolds of the remaining strains lmr013/lem451/lem457/tp <dig> and tw <dig> 

quantitative pcr  on genomic dna extracts
to estimate the copy number of the rrna genes in the  <dig> newly sequenced isolates, we used e. meliloti as a reference whose complete genome  is accessible. primers 16s-870f   <cit>  and fgps505′- <dig>   <cit>  enabling amplification of a conserved sequence of 162 bp within the 16s rrna gene were used to estimate its copy number in the genomes of the studied strains by qpcr. for each isolate, genomic dna was extracted upon growth in yem medium following a procedure described previously  <cit> . the genomic dna extracts were further quantified using the quant-it™ picogreen kit  following manufacturer’s recommendations. the genome copy number used in qpcr assay for  <dig> dilutions  and for each strain was estimated based on assembly length for each genome as described previously  <cit> . the qpcr assays were performed using the lightcyclerr <dig> system and chemistry  as recommended by the manufacturer. efficiencies of the primers  were calculated using the log of the calculated genome copy number in each dilution and their respective cycle threshold  for each compared strain. given the similar efficiencies of the primer couple used across strains, we could estimate the 16s rdna copy number  in the studied strains by applying for each dilution’s ct the following equation: n=10/− <dig> )/n with − <dig>  and  <dig>  corresponding respectively to the slope and intercept of the regression line obtained upon plotting the ct obtained from e. meliloti samples as a function of the logarithm of the 16s copy number in the corresponding dilutions, and n, the calculated genome copy number estimate in the corresponding dilution.

to test whether differences in the predicted symbiotic plasmid copy number could be identified from freshly grown cultures of strains lem <dig> and lem <dig>  the rich yem medium or rms complemented or not with the flavonoids naringenin or genistein shown to induce nodulation genes in phaseolus rhizobia  <cit>  were used. the copy number of single copy chromosomal genes glnii and reca were compared to that of  <dig> nodulation single copy genes  by qpcr using genomic dna extracts from these two strains upon growth in these different media. the primer pairs used were reca-f /reca-r , glnii-f /glnii-r , nodc-f /nodc-r  and nodf-f /nodf-r . using these primer pairs, the amplified products were respectively  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 138 bp. the qpcr assays were performed as described above. the primer efficiencies were calculated as described for the 16s copy number estimations . for each genomic dna extract, the copy numbers of the chromosome and of the putative symbiotic plasmids were estimated by averaging data from their respective markers and replicates.

plasmid profiles - eckhardt gels
plasmid profiles were determined by a modified eckhardt agarose gel electrophoresis technique as described previously  <cit> . briefly, strains were grown in ty medium until the optical density at 600 nm reached  <dig> , and 300 μl of culture was used per well. electrophoresis was carried out at 5 v for 30 min and 85 v for 6 h at 4 °c on a  <dig> % agarose gel containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. plasmid sizes were estimated by comparison with those of agrobacterium vitis s <dig>  a. fabrum c <dig>  e. meliloti  <dig> and rhizobium etli cfn <dig> 

genome annotation
draft genomes consisting in scaffolds ordered upon mauve analyzes were integrated into the rast pipeline and annotated using the “classic rast annotation scheme”   <cit> . this enabled the recovery of putative protein encoding genes , rrna and trnas as well as a functional description of predicted pegs using “figfam” classification group of proteins sharing the same function into subsystems allowing rapid identification of specific biological processes. in order to perform intra- and inter-species comparisons and analyze the relative gene content and associated functions, it is important to use the same number of genomes and the same gene prediction and functional assignment tools. therefore, for ensifer species for which more than  <dig> genome sequences were available at the time of writing , the complete genome sequences corresponding to the reference strains e. meliloti  <dig>  e. meliloti rm <dig> and e. medicae wsm <dig> as well as draft genomes from other randomly chosen strains  <cit>  were retrieved, integrated into the rast pipeline and re-annotated using the same method that was utilized for desert rhizobial genomes. finally, in order to estimate and retrieve core proteome data at the genus level, the draft genome sequences of  <dig> other ensifer species  available were also re-annotated using the same pipeline. the list of genomes used in this study is reported in table  <dig> table  <dig> strains used for comparative genomics and general characteristics upon rast annotation and cog analysis

estimation and comparison of the core and pan-genomes in  <dig> ensifer species
once -annotated, the  <dig> genomes for each species  were used to estimate their respective core species genomes. for this purpose, we used the spine tool recently developed by ozer and colleagues  <cit>  with options set to 100% of input genomes,  <dig> minimal percent identities of nucmer alignments. the order of genomes used for e. aridi was lmr <dig>  lem <dig>  tp <dig>  lmr <dig>  lem <dig> and tw10; for e. meliloti, we used the strain order  <dig>  kh12g, rm <dig>  hm007- <dig>  m <dig> and usda1002; for e. medicae, the order was wsm <dig>  a <dig>  kh36d, m <dig>  kh53a and m <dig> and finally for e. fredii, the strain order was usda <dig>  ccbau <dig>  ccbau <dig>  usda <dig>  ccbau <dig> and ccbau <dig>  for each species compared, the proportions of core/accessory genomes were retrieved and the peg list included in the conserved segments and corresponding to the reference genome  was retrieved and considered as the species conserved peg fractions or the core species genome.

to estimate the core genome at the ensifer genus level, the lmr <dig> bidirectional best hits  of translated proteins showing more than 70% identity for all  <dig> strains belonging to  <dig> ensifer species  were retained and retrieved. to identify genes and/or functions that were present in all  <dig> strains in an ensifer species but not conserved at the genus level, the fraction of pegs corresponding to the core genus level were subtracted from each core species genome.

for each one of the  <dig> compared ensifer species, a pan-genome analysis was also performed using blast analyzes as implemented in the gview package  <cit>  with as cutoffs, 1e- <dig> e-value, 80% identity and 80% of minimal alignment length.

functional description and comparison of  <dig> ensifer species
to get insights in functions associated to desert symbiotic bacteria, clusters of orthologous groups of proteins  numbers were identified by reverse position specific blast  against the cog database  <cit>  using the webmga server  <cit> . cog number with e-values below  <dig>  and their respective functional class and category were retrieved for all predicted pegs and the  <dig> core species genomes. furthermore, the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  resources  <cit>  were also used to assign kegg orthology  identifiers from core proteomes, reconstruct pathways and modules to gain insights on species conserved functional units. finally, prophage and insertions sequences  were predicted from pseudo-assembled genomes using the phast  <cit>  and issaga  <cit> .

genome based species delineation and phylogeny
to test whether the  <dig> desert strains sequenced belong to the same species, the average nucleotide identity   <cit> , in silico based dna-dna hybridization  estimates  <cit>  and correlations between tetranucleotide signatures using jspecies  <cit>  were calculated from draft genome sequences for all pair-wise comparisons  <cit> . for the ani calculation, alignment options used were 70% minimal identity over more than 700 bp in fragment windows of 1000 bp with a 200 bp step size on reciprocal best hits . for the ddh estimation, we used the genome to genome distance calculator  with the blast+ alignment method which uses the generalized linear model with the recommended formula . the resulting probability that ddh > 70% was calculated by logistic regression as described by meier-kolthoff and colleagues  <cit> .

the phylogenetic positioning of the desert ensifer strains among alpha-rhizobia was analyzed by neighbor joining  using  <dig> concatenated genes from various strains, species and genera  that showed bbh against the lmr <dig> proteome and which presented a minimum of 70% identity over at least 80% of the protein length and for which the corresponding nucleotide sequences could be aligned manually. these  <dig> genes could be considered as the most conserved both at the nucleotide and protein levels among compared organisms. the list of strains and species as well as the gene names corresponding to the well annotated genome of e. meliloti  <dig> are reported in the . predicted gene sequences were retrieved for all strains and species, aligned using clustalx and concatenated. complete deletions were performed at gap locations. the nj consensus tree was inferred using the kimura 2-parameter model and  <dig> replications.

to increase the resolution of the evolutionary relationships between the  <dig> strains belonging to the new ensifer species, phylogenies were also performed using these  <dig> alpha-rhizobia conserved concatenated gene sequences which were in great majority  located in contigs showing synteny with e. meliloti chromosome. furthermore, to compare evolutionary relationships according to replicon type synteny with e meliloti genome, a selection of e. aridi core genes which were all located in contigs ordered according to e. meliloti  <dig> symbiotic plasmid psyma  or the chromid psymb  were retrieved for all  <dig> strains. the additional file  <dig>  reports e. aridi peg lists corresponding to the  <dig> alpha-rhizobia most conserved gene set , the  <dig> psyma conserved orthologous gene set  and the selected  <dig> psymb conserved orthologous gene set . these pegs were retrieved, aligned and phylogenies were inferred as described above.

RESULTS
origin of the strains
by crossing data obtained from mlsa based diversity studies on rhizobia recovered from hot deserts in asia  <cit> , africa  <cit>  and america , a possibly new species within the ensifer genus was suggested. recovered exclusively from sandy alkaline soils in hot arid areas, this new group of symbiotic bacteria has so far never been sampled in less perturbed environments suggesting a particular adaptation to such biome. to verify if these isolates belong to the same ensifer species and to estimate their genomic and phenotypic specificity,  <dig> isolates originating from the  <dig> continents were selected . two indian strains isolated from nodules of tephrosia purpurea  and t. wallichii , two mexican strains  nodulating wild bean  growing occasionally on sand beaches in southern baja california  as well as  <dig> strains  nodulating acacia gummifera and a. raddiana  isolated by trapping using sand dune from the merzouga desert  were chosen. except tw <dig> for which the draft genome was published previously, the genomes of the  <dig> other strains were sequenced.

genome sequencing, assembly and scaffold ordering
the draft genomes of the  <dig> strains lmr <dig>  lmr <dig>  lem <dig>  lem <dig> and tp <dig> were obtained using the illumina technology  and a paired-end sequencing approach consisting of  <dig> sequential runs of 100 cycles for each strain. the number of sequences produced that passed the quality filter is reported in additional file  <dig> . they varied from  <dig> to  <dig> million depending on the library and corresponded at least to 75% of the total number of sequences produced prior filtering. sequences that passed the quality filter were trimmed and subsequently assembled with the clc genomics workbench. the results of the assembly are represented in additional file  <dig> . the genome sizes of the studied strains varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  million base pairs  and were in the range of other ensifer genomes. the whole genome shotgun  projects for strains lmr <dig>  lmr <dig>  lem <dig>  lem <dig> and tp <dig> have been deposited at ddbj/ena/genbank under the accessions luav <dig>  lufu00000000-lufx <dig> respectively  and the corresponding versions described in this paper are versions luav <dig>  lufu01000000-lufx <dig>  the number of scaffolds in the newly sequenced strains varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  surprisingly, for the strain lem <dig>  a set of  <dig> scaffolds corresponding to approximately  <dig> kilo base pairs  in length showed a significantly lower sequencing coverage mean of  <dig>  with a standard deviation  of  <dig>  compared to the remaining scaffolds which presented a mean coverage  <dig> log higher  <dig>  . moreover, these low coverage scaffolds were containing many known symbiotic genes that were missing in the remaining scaffolds and were therefore kept for downstream analyzes. the n <dig> values varied between  <dig> and  <dig> kbp with l <dig> values ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> in the newly sequenced strains.

the alignment of conserved regions from the  <dig> genomes corresponding to the newly identified species upon scaffold ordering is shown in fig.  <dig>  globally, we found that large conserved collinear blocks were found for the regions showing similarities with the e. meliloti  <dig> chromosome as well as the chromid psymb while a central region and the 3′ end of genomes showed fewer similarities between compared strains. in ensifer strains and species for which complete genomes are available the symbiotic genes are often located in large plasmids. based on this knowledge, we suggest that the central variable region and probably part of the 3′ end of assembled genomes in our new species are located on symbiotic plasmids. for instance, nod and nif genes involved in symbiosis development and functioning as well as rep, tra and trb gene clusters involved in plasmid replication and transfer were identified in scaffolds located in these variable regions for all compared strains. furthermore, when we compared the actual location of the genomic fraction that represented the low covered scaffolds from strain lem <dig> , we found that these mapped to the central region showing similarities to psyma and the 3′ end of the pseudo-assembled genome which include scaffolds with lowest similarities as they were neither conserved at the genus nor at the species levels . however, the current drafts do not allow identifying the actual replicon type ), number and size that would require an additional gap closure sequencing strategy, pulse field gel electrophoreses or the use of a promising sequencing technology that produces very long reads such as pacbio. however, the results of the eckhardt gel analysis clearly showed the presence of extra-chromosomal replicons in all studied isolates . notably, it demonstrates the presence of large plasmids whose range varied greatly between compared strains. interestingly, a large replicon of approximately  <dig>  mbp could be identified in all desert strains which may correspond to a large plasmid  and additional replicons of variable sizes  were predicted in the newly sequenced strains. the moroccan strains presented  <dig> additional replicons each including a large one of ca  <dig>  mbp and a smaller one of ca  <dig> kbp  or  <dig> kbp . the profile of one of the mexican strain lem <dig> also indicated the presence of  <dig> additional replicons , while the profile obtained from the second strain  showed the presence of a single plasmid of ca  <dig> kbp. finally, as for the moroccan strains, the indian strain tp <dig> profile indicated the presence of  <dig> extra replicons of ca  <dig>  and  <dig>  mbp . intriguingly, the strain lem <dig> appeared to lack a replicon as compared to the other strains. the net difference in sequence coverage obtained between the two sets of scaffolds upon mapping of sequencing reads for this particular strain and the lack of an observable replicon by eckhardt gel electrophoresis when compared to other strains strongly suggest a partial loss of a replicon which could correspond, based on the presence of symbiotic genes in low coverage scaffolds, to a symbiotic plasmid. such loss or instability of accessory plasmid by this symbiotic bacterium may result from subculturing without interaction with its host plant  <cit> . to test whether we could show such plasmid loss or instability, a qpcr assay was performed using genomic dna extracts from fresh cultures of the two strains lem <dig> and lem <dig> isolated from the same host  and which share a set of  <dig> orthologs  located in the low coverage scaffolds of lem <dig>  two chromosomal single copy genes  as well as two conserved symbiotic markers  were used as targets. the results shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig> clearly demonstrates that regardless the growth medium used, gdna extracts from strain lem <dig> were deprived of the targeted nodulation genes as no amplification was observed which contrast with results obtained from strain lem <dig>  this loss most probably results from the selection of clones that had already lost the plasmid for the qpcr assays but corroborate results obtained from eckhardt gel analysis. nevertheless, the loss of the symbiotic plasmid may be of interest in biotechnology through the introduction of other plasmids that may broaden the host spectrum of this species but should however also be taken into account for a potential use as biofertilizer . the instability of this putative symbiotic plasmid was only observed in the strain lem <dig>  here, the main objectives were to clarify whether the desert strains originating from the three continents belonged to the same new species within the ensifer genus and identifying conserved gene fraction and putative functions associated with this possibly new taxon.fig.  <dig> genome wide alignment of the  <dig> desert rhizobial draft genomes. the finished genome of ensifer meliloti  <dig> consisting of concatenated replicons in the order chromosome, psyma and psymb  was first used as a reference to order the  <dig> scaffolds of lmr <dig>  using the progressive mauve aligner. the resulting reordered pseudo-assembled lmr <dig> genome was subsequently used as reference to reorder the scaffolds of lmr <dig> , lem <dig> , lem <dig> , tp <dig>  and tw <dig> . scales above each map refer to genome size in million base pairs . scaffold borders are indicated by vertical red bars and locally collinear blocks are shown using similar colors across draft genomes. colorless spaces indicate accessory genomic regions




genome automated annotations
the pseudo-assembled genomes of the desert strains studied were integrated into the rast pipeline that enabled the prediction of pegs and rna features for all strains. the results of the automated annotation by rast are shown in table  <dig> and the genomes can be browsed from rast website  <cit> . the number of pegs varied from  <dig> to  <dig> which corresponded to an approximate density of  <dig> gene every kbp of sequence which is comparable to other ensifer strains and species . the number of predicted rnas varied from  <dig> to  <dig> and only one copy of the rrnas  was predicted upon assembly in the newly sequenced strains. however, the fact that in the  <dig> newly sequenced strains, the rrna genes were assembled into a single scaffold of approximately  <dig>  kbp  with a greater sequencing coverage when compared to the sequencing read coverage at the genome wide level suggests that this locus is repeated. indeed, the copy number of ribosomal rna genes may be underestimated due to assembly limitations of large repeated regions when using the illumina sequencing technology. to clarify this, a qpcr assay was performed . using e. meliloti as a reference, the calculation in the studied genomes returned a copy number ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>   except for strain lem <dig> which indicated a copy number of  <dig>  . the fact that our calculation did not return integers was expected as the calculation was performed assuming that  the molecular weight of the genomic dna was correlated to the genome size regardless of gc % differences between the genomes and  there is one copy of each genomic replicon per cell. the difference obtained for the strain lem <dig> may result from the loss of the symbiotic plasmid representing a tenth of the remaining genome size in that particular strain gdna extract which would higher the 16s rdna copy number estimate by 10%. nevertheless, these results suggest that the scaffold which contained all the ribosomal rna genes was present in multiple copies, most probably  <dig>  in the genomes under study. the gc content varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. the results of the genome annotation obtained for the  <dig> other ensifer strains and species are also shown in table  <dig>  the gc % was the most conserved feature at the species level.

genome based species delineation and positioning of the strains in the phylogeny of alpha-rhizobia
one of the objectives of the present study was to verify whether the desert ensifer strains isolated from the three continents belong to a new ensifer species. using draft genome sequences from the  <dig> strains, the ani and in silico ddh estimations were calculated for all pair-wise comparisons. the results of the comparisons are summarized as a matrix in the fig.  <dig> and show clearly that, regardless of the strain or the method, all  <dig> strains could be regarded as belonging to the same species. the distributions of the % identities of nucleotide fragments used for the ani calculation are represented as box plots in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  the number of fragments used for the ani measures  ranged from  <dig>  for the most divergent strains  to  <dig>  for the closest strains . more than 75% of the 1000 bp fragments were at least 99% identical in all comparisons suggesting high sequence conservation among strains, regardless of their origin. in line with these results, using the tetra analysis tool from jspecies, the regression coefficients from pair-wise comparisons of tetranucleotide signatures were very high . intra- and inter-species ani calculations were also performed using available genome sequences confirming that the new taxon described here corresponds to a new species with ani values comparable to that of e. meliloti, e. medicae or e. fredii intra-species comparisons and which differ greatly from inter-species ani values that were all below 95% which corresponds to the current cutoff value used for species delineation . with the reduction of wgs sequencing costs, such methods will be increasingly used in the future and may replace the traditional and tedious dna-dna hybridization approach used for species delineation. furthermore, the availability of genomic data and comparative tools may help better understanding the evolution and specificities of each species through comparative genomics  <cit> .fig.  <dig> genome wide based species delineation among desert ensifer strains. top right values on the matrix  show results obtained from a two-way ani calculation expressed as a % ± standard deviation while bottom left values on the matrix  show results from ddh estimations using generalized linear model and the recommended formula  and are expressed as a % ± standard deviation together with the probabilities that ddh > 70%  in parentheses





to evaluate the phylogenetic positioning of the new ensifer species among selected alpha-rhizobia,  <dig> of the most conserved genes among alpha-rhizobia  were selected, aligned and concatenated. merged sequences were analyzed by neighbor joining and the resulting tree from  <dig> replications is shown in fig.  <dig>  again, all the  <dig> strains clustered together and showed very little sequence divergence as indicated by the low branch length within the clade they formed which was comparable to that found between strains belonging to the same species such as e. meliloti or e. medicae. we obtained bootstrap values of 100% for nearly all nodes within the ensifer clade showing the robustness of the tree generated. the closest relative of the presently described species was e. saheli, a species recovered from sesbania nodule from arid hot environment.fig.  <dig> neighbor joining tree showing phylogenetic relationships among  <dig> rhizobial strains. the tree was computed using  <dig> conserved gene sequences that were concatenated and aligned. there were  <dig>  aligned bases in the final dataset after removal of ambiguous positions. evolutionary distances were computed using the k2p method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. the percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test  is shown next to the branches . the tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. moroccan, mexican and indian strains are highlighted in green, purple and blue respectively




given the isolation of this symbiotic ensifer species in arid and hot environments from three continents, we here propose the name ensifer aridi. this species may have acquired locally symbiotic and accessory genes most probably in the form of large  plasmids which could explain the differences of hosts with which they associate and consequently symbiovars may further be defined  <cit> .

comparative genomics
to compare the  <dig> studied desert ensifer genomes, the predicted pegs were classified along the pseudo-assembled draft genomes according to their presence in  all ensifer strains compared ,  all the  <dig> desert strains but not all other species ,  strains from the same geographical origin   several strains but without geographical conservation or  uniquely one strain  . the pseudo-assembled genomes of the  <dig> strains contained distinct regions . the left side of the draft genomes contained a large region carrying approximately  <dig> pegs that were in majority conserved at the genus  or at the species level . this high conservation of this large genomic region was expected as it corresponds to the scaffolds showing homologies to the chromosome of e. meliloti that carries most conserved housekeeping functions. a central variable part, ordered according to similarities with the symbiotic plasmid psyma of e. meliloti, contained a higher proportion of strain specific genes or pegs shared between strains from the same geographical origin which corroborated their respective associations to specific hosts that most probably rely on symbiotic plasmids  and very few genus or species conserved genes. the region showing similarities to the chromid psymb of e. meliloti  <dig> contained mostly species specific genes and to a lesser extent genus conserved genes . finally, the 3′ end of the draft genomes contained the remaining scaffolds which were not conserved at the species level and which included a high number of scaffolds in this region suggesting the presence of repeated sequences . these latter scaffolds may be part of the most variable genomic fractions that is probably carried by accessory plasmid identified in our strains. furthermore, our results show that the indian strain which present slightly larger genome sizes as compared to other e. aridi strains  possess a larger proportion of genes that are specific to strains isolated from the same region  suggesting acquisition of a higher number of accessory genes locally.fig.  <dig> proportion of bidirectional best hits  along pseudo-assembled ensifer aridi genomes in relation to their occurrence in all ensifer strains  and species  compared , all e. aridi strains presently compared , in e. aridi strains originating from the same geographical location . the 100% piled area graphs on the left panel show the percentage of predicted pegs in each category along pseudo-assembled genomes of ensifer aridi strains lmr <dig>  and lmr <dig>  originating from morocco, lem <dig>  and lem <dig>  originating from mexico, tp <dig>  and tw <dig>  originating from india. pegs numbers being ordered according to their genomic location on the pseudo-assembled genomes, we used a  <dig> pegs step which roughly correspond to  <dig> kbp increments from which the % of pegs in each class was calculated. the pie charts on the right side of each area graph show the global repartition of hits in defined categories for each strain using the same color codes. moroccan, mexican and indian indicates presence of hits in both strains from the same geographical origin  while “other” refers to hits in strains from another geographical origin but without geographical conservation




based on assembly and scaffold ordering, recovery of genes involved in plasmid replication and mobilization  and on eckhardt gel analysis, our results suggest that the genomes studied are composed by a chromosome of approximately  <dig>  mbp which included a majority of housekeeping genes that are conserved among ensifer species, a chromid of  <dig> – <dig>  mbp containing a majority of genes conserved at the species and to a lesser extent at the genus levels and large plasmid which contained mainly accessory genes among which symbiotic nod and nif genes that most probably correspond to symbiotic plasmids. the genomic architecture and notably the presence of extra-chromosomal replicons representing nearly half the genomes that contains hyper variable genes including those involved in the symbiosis appears conserved among ensifer and rhizobium strains and species and differs from most mesorhizobium or bradyrhizobium species  <cit> . despite the lack of complete genome sequences, our results further support such observation.

to explore the synteny level and the evolutionary relationships of genes conserved among the  <dig> desert strains, the  <dig> housekeeping genes used for the phylogenetic analysis and highly conserved among alpha-rhizobia, as well as genes that were mapped to the variable region showing homologies to e. meliloti  <dig> psyma  or psymb  were retrieved, their order was compared and the overall evolutionary distances inferred upon concatenation and neighbor joining analyzes . we found that the great majority of genes  identified as the most conserved among alpha-rhizobia were located on the putative chromosomes  and showed high synteny as estimated upon plotting of their respective gene order between the strain lmr <dig> and the other isolates . genes present in the variable central region presented lower synteny confirming the high variability of this region that presents homologies to psyma . in contrast, the  <dig> selected genes along the region showing homologies to psymb showed high synteny despite a large rearrangement predicted in strain lmr <dig> . intra-species evolutionary distances obtained when comparing  <dig> concatenated housekeeping genes principally located on the predicted chromosomes  indicated a close proximity between the moroccan  and the mexican strains  without clustering of the strains according to their geographical origin. these  <dig> strains that grouped together showed between  <dig> and  <dig> variable sites out of the  <dig>  aligned nucleotides and were clearly separated  from indian isolates  that showed extremely high sequence conservation with only  <dig> variable sites out of the  <dig>  aligned nucleotides . the intra-species evolutionary distances obtained when comparing genes presumably located on the symbiotic plasmids  showed a clustering of the strains according to their geographical origin with however a greater sequence divergence except for the comparison between the indian isolates . the tree inferred from genes located in the region showing similarities to psymb of e. meliloti  <dig> indicated a greater divergence between the mexican strain lem <dig> and the strains lem <dig>  lmr <dig> and lmr <dig>  and again high sequence conservation between the two indian strains tp <dig> and tw <dig>  the % identity between the concatenated gene sets varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  when the  <dig> genes conserved among alpha-rhizobia were compared, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  when the  <dig> concatenated gene sequences located on scaffolds showing similarities with the chromid psymb of e. meliloti were used and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the  <dig> concatenated gene sequences located in the psyma syntenic region . overall, these results showed that the two indian strains share a more conserved genome with regard to other pair-wise comparisons which corroborates ani and in silico ddh results . the phylogenies of the concatenated gene sets located in regions showing homologies to the chromosome and the chromid of e. meliloti did not cluster the moroccan and the mexican strains according to their geographical origin indicating a closer evolutionary relationship.fig.  <dig> synteny of predicted protein encoding genes and evolutionary relationships among e. aridi strains in relation to peg orthologies in e. meliloti  <dig> replicons. peg numbers corresponding to the  <dig> conserved genes among alpha-rhizobial strains and species as well as selected  <dig> and  <dig> orthologs from the  <dig> e. aridi strains  located in scaffolds showing synteny with, respectively psyma and psymb of e. meliloti  <dig> are represented in . the synteny conservation between pegs corresponding to these three gene sets  were represented by plotting peg numbers of the lmr <dig> strains against the other e. aridi strains . evolutionary relationships of the corresponding gene sets upon concatenation  were inferred using neighbor joining tree construction as described in methods; and showed bootstrap values  near nodes, the scales at the bottom of each tree shows the number of substitutions per site. strains originating from morocco, mexico and india were highlighted respectively in green, purple and blue . the matrix  show the respective number of variable sites  and percentage identities , the color code on the left of the matrix shows the % identity conservation obtained from pair-wise nucleotide sequence comparisons of the  <dig> concatenated and aligned gene sets obtained for the tree construction of e, f and g respectively. the number of positions aligned for each set is shown on the top left cell in each matrix




the proportion and composition of the core genome in the new species was compared to those of  <dig> ensifer species for which more than  <dig> genome sequences were available at the time of writing . using the method developed by ozer and colleagues  <cit> , the sizes of core and accessory genomes as well as the gc % of each fraction were estimated and the pegs assigned to each fraction  were retrieved . the size of the core genomes varied between species. the smallest core genome was that of e. aridi with  <dig>  mbp, e. fredii and e. meliloti indicated respectively core genomes of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mbp and the largest estimated core genome was found for e. medicae with  <dig>  mbp. core genomes represented from  <dig> to 87% of the genomes . the gc % of accessory genomes were lower  than those corresponding to the core genomes  for all  <dig> species studied. the gc profile and segmentation points along pseudo-assembled genomes were investigated in the  <dig> ensifer aridi strains using gc-profile  <cit>  and indicates that the region corresponding to the scaffolds in synteny with e. meliloti psyma presented a lower and more variable gc %  which based on our analyzes contain most of the accessory genomic fraction in our desert species. on the basis of spine analysis it was also observed that the average  of accessory genome size in e. aridi was comparatively larger  than those of e. meliloti, e. medicae and e. fredii. interestingly, the gc profiles obtained from pseudo-assembled genomes and the size of the three regions in our genomes are in line with the description made earlier regarding the replicon  general characteristics  <cit> .

taken together, the facts that this variable region  shows evolutionary relationships that correlate with host and geographical origin  and contains symbiosis specific, plasmid replication and mobilization genes and the presence of large plasmids as revealed by eckhardt gel analysis demonstrates the presence of such replicons in this species which is common among ensifer species  <cit> . furthermore, given the evolutionary distances obtained on the three putative replicons and their corresponding conservation levels  , our data support the evolutionary scenario presented by gallardini and colleagues on the differential evolutionary routes multipartite genomes may undergo as exemplified in e. meliloti  <cit> . nevertheless, additional experiments are required to further test this hypothesis and notably estimate the relative evolutionary routes undertaken among isolates belonging to this new species.

based on  <dig> genomes per species and using sequence identities of 80% on 80% of sequence alignments as cutoff values, the pan-genomes of e. aridi, e. meliloti, e. medicae and e. fredii included  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  putative gene clusters contained within  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mbp respectively. the tblastx results using the aforementioned cutoffs for the  <dig> strains included in the analysis and for each species on their respective pan-genomes are represented in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  the large pan-genomes identified in the  <dig> species support the wide phenotypic versatility among ensifer species and strains that have to adapt to various environments. there were however differences between the species with a greater genomic diversity found in e. fredii and e. aridi which may be related to the broader diversity of hosts with which they may be associated. despite a similar proportion of core and accessory genomes in strains belonging to these two species , the size of the core genome and the pan-genome analysis indicated a lower proportion of conserved protein shared by all e. aridi strains. however, this conservation level was higher when strains from the same geographical origin were compared. the larger diversity of proteins in accessory genomes in this species and the greater conservation between strains isolated from the same region further support the presence of variable large plasmid acquired locally.

functional genomics
to explore the functional attributes associated to the new desert rhizobia and compare them to other ensifer species, we used the cog and kegg classifications of conserved gene sets that were predicted in each of the  <dig> species ensifer meliloti, e. medicae, e. fredii and e. aridi. the number of pegs identified in each core species genome and results from cog assignments are reported in table  <dig>  we found that the core genome of the new e. aridi species contains a smaller number of pegs when compared to the other ensifer species. this difference may be due to the relatively lower  genome size  and  proportion of the core genome  found in this new species. to further compare the functions associated to the new desert species, we then subtracted from the core gene sets , those that were conserved at the genus level and which included  <dig> putative genes. the number of pegs corresponding to species conserved gene sets , those corresponding to the core ensifer genus and the proportions of peg with cog assignment are presented in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  if the number of genes identified as species conserved in the new species was slightly lower as compared to the other ensifer species, the proportion of genes with assigned cog class was globally conserved across species  and the genes that were identified as conserved at the genus level showed more than  <dig> % of cog assignments . being conserved across species and strains, this higher functional classification was expected as these genes have more chances to be essential and include housekeeping functions that have been more thoroughly studied. the relative abundance of each cog class was estimated for the  <dig> compared core ensifer genomes . to highlight variations in the cog classification between core proteomes at the genus level  and the species conserved fractions, for each functional class, we calculated and log <dig> transformed ratio of the species enriched associated cog fraction by the “core genus genome” associated cog fraction, and we represented the results as horizontal histogram . we found that, regardless of the species compared, cog classes d, o, j, c, n, f, h and i were overrepresented in the conserved genus fraction while classes t, k, g, p and q were inversely more represented in the “species conserved” fractions. classes j , f and h  were significantly more represented in the genus conserved fraction. as expected, the most significant difference between genus and species conserved fractions was found for the class j which include all components of the translational machinery that is particularly conserved at the interspecies level. conversely, classes k , g and p  were significantly more represented in the  <dig> species compared suggesting diversification of associated functions in the genus. a recent study on the model e. meliloti showed that upon curation of psymb  and psyma, the resulting variant consisting of a chromosome to which psymb essential genes were integrated showed a marked reduction in carbon sources it could utilize with only  <dig> c source instead of the  <dig> c that wild type strain can take up and metabolize  <cit> . additionally, several nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur sources were impacted by the lack of plasmid and chromid replicons. the study by dicenzo and colleagues shows that dispensable replicons, which contain mostly accessory genes, enable the bacterium to widen its niche range. our results supports such observation as cog classes g and p are over-represented in the species enriched fractions as compared to the genus conserved fraction.fig.  <dig> cog classification of ensifer species specific and genus conserved gene sets. the left side horizontal histogram  shows the percentage of predicted pegs from conserved gene sets as classified in cog classes and processes. the cog classification of the core ensifer proteome at the genus level  is shown as black bars on the left side graph. predicted proteomes conserved in e. aridi , e. meliloti , e. medicae  and e. fredii  were obtained by subtracting the core ensifer proteomes to core species proteomes . the right side horizontal histogram  shows for each cog class the logarithmic base  <dig> ratios of the species conserved gene set fraction by that found in the core ensifer gene set. a negative value indicates higher representation of the corresponding class in the core genus gene set as compared to the species conserved gene set and conversely, a positive value suggests that the corresponding class is more represented in the species conserved gene set. the color code used for the species enriched or core ensifer gene sets is indicated at the bottom of the graph. cog classes, their respective descriptions and the process to which they belong to are indicated in black text in the figure. values that are significantly different  within a cog class upon comparison of k proportions using the marascuillo procedure as implemented in xlstat are indicated by a red “*”  and different red letters in  indicate intra-class significant differences in the log <dig> ratios between species conserved and genus conserved gene set fractions




despite a similar proportion of pegs with cog assignment in the  <dig> compared conserved species proteomes , we found notable differences in the relative proportions of cog classes between species . in e. aridi, we found a higher proportion of pegs assigned to the classes m  and s  in the species conserved fraction relative to the genus conserved fraction. in contrast, classes u  and l  showed the opposite . the higher proportion of genes in class m indicates that e. aridi has favored, in contrast to the compared species this cellular process that may be essential for sustainability in deserts. interestingly, e. aridi also showed a higher proportion of poorly characterized class s cogs that have unknown functions which could also participate in sustainment in desert. the lower proportion of species conserved genes categorized in class l in e. aridi was significant as compared to other species and was somehow surprising as one could expect a higher number of genes associated to replication, recombination and repair functions as shown for example for deinococcus deserti  <cit> . this observation suggests that other mechanisms may participate in the tolerance to abiotic stresses in this new ensifer species. furthermore, the lower amount of items identified in the new species core genome cog class l that also include mobile proteins and other phage related elements may also suggest that it is less subjected to horizontal gene transfer  and genomic rearrangement as compared to the  <dig> other rhizobial species despite a higher proportion of accessory genes that may result however from a greater variability of plasmids acquired.

the number of phage and virus related sequences as well as insertion sequences that participate to intra-genomic recombinations were estimated using phast and issaga pipelines respectively in the  <dig> compared species. the presence of is and prophage was predicted in all strains and species which support the capacity of symbiotic nitrogen fixing bacteria to acquire genes from related or more distant species, and to concomitantly undergo intra-genomic rearrangements that may partly explain their “mosaic” type of genomic architecture and their capacity to adapt to contrasted environments  . however, the frequency of prophages and is varied both at the intra- and inter-specific levels . regarding prophage sequences, for each species, intact prophage sequences were predicted in at least  <dig> strains out of  <dig> analyzed here. the lowest numbers of predicted phage related regions were found in e. aridi and e. fredii while e. medicae presented the greatest number of intact or questionable prophage sequences. the number of is also showed marked differences between strains and species . considering all is predicted by issaga, the mean number of is per genome were respectively  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for e. aridi, e. meliloti, e. medicae and e. fredii. these is were classified in  <dig> is families and their respective frequencies are reported in additional file  <dig> . the mean numbers of is families predicted in e. aridi, e. meliloti, e. medicae and e. fredii were respectively  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  which shows great differences between species. five is families were predicted in all strains and species . globally, we found a relatively low is diversity and density in e. aridi, a higher is density in e. medicae and a higher diversity of is families in e. fredii as compared to other species. the is density among ensifer species was highly correlated to the number of items identified in cog class l observed from functional genomics analyzes and explain the variability observed in this particular class . these results suggest that in comparison to other species studied here, e. aridi strains possess a lower diversifying agent potential which could limit their adaptation to other ecological niches  <cit> . however, we found in the genomes of e. aridi that predicted prophage regions were mainly incomplete and intact prophage regions were only identified in the indian strains suggesting a more recent transfer in asian isolates. the higher is density and intact prophage regions predicted in the indian isolates suggest a higher potential of recombination in these strains as compared to moroccan and mexican ones that may result from a more recent transfer event.

with the objective to identify functions associated to the new ensifer species, rast predicted protein sequences from proteomes conserved by each one of the  <dig> ensifer species compared were further subjected to pathway reconstruction using kegg tools which enables to retrieve functional modules . we found that only half of the predicted proteins conserved at the species level had a ko assigned in the  <dig> species  which shows that many functions remain to be identified in this genus. nevertheless, based on current knowledge of orthologous protein functions and interplay in a defined pathway or structural complex , it remains possible to compare proteomes in silico and identify the presence of currently known functions. using the module reconstruction tool on the core species proteomes from which the conserved genus proteome was subtracted, we could rapidly identify functions associated to a species. the additional file  <dig>  shows the results obtained upon module reconstruction in the  <dig> ensifer species compared. using this comparative tool, we found  <dig> modules that appear species conserved  while not identified in the conserved genes set shared by the  <dig> ensifer species. surprisingly,  <dig> out of  <dig> of these species conserved modules were predicted in ensifer fredii. some of these functions may participate in the broad host range found in this species as exemplified by strains hh <dig> and usda <dig>  <cit> . the remaining two species conserved modules were found in e. aridi. these were two atp binding cassette  type transport systems for octopine/nopaline  and inositol phosphate  that both rely on  <dig> units . according to kegg based orthologies and specific blast searches, the module m <dig>  was predicted in  <dig> copies for both the indian and the moroccan strains while a single copy was found in the both mexican strains. being identified from the core genome of e. aridi, this transport system is also present in other root nodulating bacterial strains or species but its frequency may vary at the intra-species level . given the phylogenetic proximity between symbiotic rhizobia and agrobacterium from which these genes whose function were described, and the sharing of their habitats, this transport system has possibly evolved from ancient hgt events which may provide improved fitness to the bacterial strains capable of utilizing such compounds  <cit> . furthermore, a possible affinity of this transport system toward amino acids or derivatives may have enabled to broaden/ameliorate the nutrient uptake capacity in the new ensifer species presented here. the second system that was predicted in all  <dig> sequenced strains of e. aridi was revealed by the prediction of the complete kegg module m <dig> that refers to an abc type inositol phosphate transport system. the scarcity of such module among rhizobia as referred to kegg orthology distribution indicates that it may be seen as a particular trait associated to the presently described species. inositol phosphates and derivatives constitute the majority of soil organic phosphates and the presence of this transport system may be essential for survival in a nutrient poor environment such as desert. this capacity may enable the bacterium to utilize phosphorylated inositol derived compounds originating from the plant degradation which would further improve the bacterial fitness and participate in its survival by providing utilizable carbon and phosphorus sources upon plant/nodule senescence. furthermore, if a myo-inositol phosphate synthase was predicted in all e. aridi strains, this transport system may also, together with derived compounds, participate in the osmotolerance of the symbionts  <cit>  and contribute to the particular adaptation of this new rhizobium toward environmental stresses such as those found in desert biome. attempts to grow selected strains using octopine or nopaline as sole carbon sources in at medium produced negative results, however, we could not conclude that these compounds are not transported but that under these conditions, such c sources were not transported and/or utilized by these bacteria. indeed, additional biochemical and genetic studies are required to identify the substrates’ affinities of the abc type transporters identified here in silico and characterize their functional roles which are outside the scope of this report. nevertheless, to improve our knowledge on this new species, several phenotypic characters were studied including  the potential utilization of various carbon sources,  their tolerance to salt, ph, temperature and antibiotics and  their capacity to nodulate several legumes of potential interest.

phenotypic characterization of ensifer aridi
to study the phenotypic characteristics of the new taxon identified here, the sequenced strains were screened for their capacity to utilize a wide range of carbon sources using the biolog gn <dig> microplate system and compared to those of e. meliloti  <dig>  the results of the phenotypic macro-arrays are presented in the additional file  <dig>  we found that the great majority of carbohydrates screened could be utilized by all e. aridi strains except xylitol. the wide range of carbohydrates rhizobia can utilize is expected as these microorganisms are mainly growing in soils which requires the capacity to utilize a broad range of carbohydrates for their nutrition. even though the relative capacity varied with the chemical and the strain, all e. aridi strains were also able to utilize pyruvic acid methyl ester and succinic acid methyl esters, the following carboxylic acids: acetic acid, formic acid, d-glucosaminic acid, b-hydroxybutyric acid, d,l–lactic acid, malonic acid, propionic acid and succinic acid; glycerol and the amino acids and derivatives : l-alanyl-glycine, l-asparagine, l-aspartic acid, l-glutamic acid, l-histidine, hydroxy-l-proline, l-ornithine, l-proline, d,l-carnitine, γ-aminobutyric acid; the aromatic chemical uridine and finally the brominated compound bromosuccinic acid . it should be noted that a selection of  <dig> carbohydrates tested in gn <dig> plate were also tested using the himedia disc fermentation assays which indicated contrasting results and demonstrate that the basal medium used can affect metabolic capacities in the studied strains. interestingly, among compounds that were utilized by all desert strains, the malonic acid was efficiently metabolized and the only substrate that was not used by e. meliloti. previous phenotypic tests on various rhizobia including ensifer strains belonging to e. meliloti, e. fredii, e. saheli and e. terangae  <cit>  supports the originality of such metabolic capacity among ensifer species which is however identified in r. leguminosarum as shown by a recent report showing that the majority of the  <dig> rhizobium leguminosarum strains screened phenotypically were capable of using this carbon source  <cit> . malonate utilization most probably rely in the presence of the matrabc locus shown to be involved in the regulation through a gntr type transcriptional regulator encoded by matr  <cit> , a malonyl-coenzyme a  decarboxylase encoded by mata, a malonyl-coa synthetase encoded by matb and a probable malonate carrier protein encoded by matc in this species  <cit> . however, our results on e. meliloti  <dig> differ from a previous study which demonstrated that this strain was capable of growth in media containing this organic acid as sole carbon source which was genetically linked to matpqmab genes and relied on a tripartite atp-independent permease  system for import encoded by the three genes matpqm  <cit> . nevertheless, in the latter study, the growth was very slow when compared to glucose containing media and no growth was observed during the first 3 days which could explain the difference with our report since we only recorded results after 3 days. the use of malonate as a carbon source was further tested for three strains of ensifer aridi  and e. meliloti  <dig> upon a 5 days growth in the minimal growth medium at complemented with malonate , succinate  or a mixture of succinate and malonate . the results shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig> confirmed the ability of all the strains tested to grow on malonate as the sole carbon source but this growth was very limited for most of the strains. when compared to the medium containing succinate as sole carbon source, the growth was nearly identical for the indian strain tp <dig> which contrasts with the mexican strain lem <dig> , the moroccan strain lmr <dig>  and e. meliloti . more interestingly, using a mixture of the both carbon sources but at a concentration of 20 mm each, we found that, compared to the succinate, the growth was significantly increased in the three e. aridi strains tested while it was reduced by a third in the reference e. meliloti strain. this result demonstrates the efficiency to utilize malonate in desert ensifer strains and suggests the presence of functional import system and metabolism for this carbon source despite the competitive effect it has on succinate dehydrogenase which leads to a reduced tricarboxylic acid  cycle functioning  <cit> . the genomes of the desert e. aridi strains were screened for the presence of genes involved in malonate uptake and metabolism which led to the discovery of a locus containing the matrabc genes that were in synteny with those of r. leguminosarum. specific blast searches were performed on genomes from the sinorhizobium/ensifer clade and showed that it was also present in some e. fredii strains as well as in the sequenced e. saheli strain usda <dig> which was however showing no growth in a previous report  <cit>  and which suggests the involvement of additional genes for efficient malonate anabolism. the high level of malonate found in many leguminous plants including roots and nodules and studies on matb mutant suggested that this c3-dicarboxylic acid could be involved in symbiotic nitrogen fixation . however latter studies on e. meliloti  <cit>  and r. leguminosarum  <cit>  mat mutants showed that malonate is not a driver of the biological n <dig> fixation and genes involved in its metabolism are dispensable for proper symbiotic function although this may depend on the malonate level in nodules which varies with the plant species and/or growth conditions. interestingly, given the high proportion of the potentially toxic organic acid malonate in roots and nodules found in some leguminous plants, the presence of mechanisms that can import and metabolize efficiently this compound such as that found in r. leguminosarum and few other species may be seen as a competitive advantage towards other root colonizing microorganisms including symbiotic ones and pathogens. in the case of the desert rhizobial strains, such metabolic capacity may be required so as to optimize infections and successful nodulation when the microorganism meets host roots which are rare in desert soils.

the studied strains were also tested for their growth at high temperatures and on media that contained bromothymol blue, various ph, nacl concentrations or antibiotics . the results suggest that like other ensifer species, e. aridi strains are acid producing, fast growing and tolerate high nacl concentrations. strain tp <dig> showed however a lower tolerance toward high salt concentrations as it didn’t show growth when 2% of nacl was added to the culture medium. furthermore this latter strain also presented a particularly high antibiotic resistance spectrum as it was growing in presence of chloramphenicol, kanamycin, streptomycin, nalidixic acid and spectinomycin while the strains from morocco and mexico presented tolerance to only nalidixic acid and spectinomycin. if the strain tw <dig> also resisted to nalidixic acid, it also resisted to kanamycin but was sensitive to spectinomycin. we found that all strains were capable of growth at 48 °c which has not been reported in other defined ensifer species and at high ph which would be expected as the soils sampled were all alkaline   <cit> ,  and temperatures in the sampled soils may often reach such extremes.


ensifer aridi strains isolated from different continents were tested for their nodulation ability on selected legume species  belonging to all the three subfamilies of fabaceae . these strains are effectively nodulating various arid leguminous trees which can be used for arid reforestation programs. the difference in the host range between different strains can be explained on the basis of the individual symbiosis related gene phylogenies  <cit> ,  as well as through the comparative analysis of the accessory genome sequences that are, according to the data presented in this report, probably carried by large plasmids. although the mexican e. aridi strain isolated from phaseolus filiformis nodulated several species including vachellia, senegalia and prosopis, it did not form nodules on v. gummifera and species of tephrosia from which the other strains were isolated. all the e. aridi strains failed to develop nodules with mimosa, glycine max and arachis hypogaea which suggests that the nodulation of these tested legumes require more specific symbiotic determinants.

CONCLUSIONS
using comparative genomics and current genome based species delineation tools, a new ensifer species that appears particularly adapted to hot desert could be characterized. despite a majority of genes with no function assignments, the kegg based analysis performed on the species specific proteome enabled to identify two abc type transporters possibly involved in the transport of inositol phosphate and octopine/nopaline that remain however to be functionally characterized. furthermore, the phenotypic macroarrays enabled the identification of malonate as a carbon source it can utilize efficiently and which may have broaden its fitness toward legumes that produce this organic acid. such conserved functions may participate in its survival in desert biome where these strains were recovered and may be further studied. a large accessory gene set that is probably carried by plasmids that varied in size among isolates may in part explain the different plant species they are able to nodulate. being particularly adapted to high temperatures, aridity and alkaline type of soils, being present on three continents, e. aridi appears to have acquired locally divergent symbiotic gene sets. given these particular traits, this new species deserves interest notably for its potential in biotechnology. its capacity to host variable symbiotic determinants suggest competency in transferring/acquiring symbiotic determinants through hgt such as plasmid transfers that may enlarge its host range and our results indicated the loss of symbiotic genes from one of the strain that most probably resulted from plasmid curing following subculturing. looking to symbiotaxonomy of e. aridi strains, it is suggested that they are promiscuous and mainly nodulate members of mimosoideae and papilionoideae including annual herbaceous crop legumes  and perennial trees . cross nodulation studies and the inter and intra host ranges described here is interesting and further supports its acquisition of nod-nif kits from local rhizobia associated with host in that particular ecological niche. during the long term host-rhizobia co-evolution, soil factors and the host selection pressure resulted in diversification of symbiotic properties of these rhizobia. finally, the distribution of this new species in desert biome in three continents raises several questions which remain to be investigated. notably, the reason why they are until now only recovered from desert type of biome at such distant geographical locations. are these bacteria part of the microbial cortege which are transported through desert sand storms and which have been shown to enable microbial trans oceanic trips . if such hypothesis could explain the presence of this species in the three continents, the reason regarding its recovery from arid environments is however puzzling. indeed, one would expect a wider spread through transported sands that are deposited over large regions and which should have enabled its recovery from more types of biomes. a poor competitivity when in presence of indigenous rhizobia from other types of environments which favor microbial densities could partly explain this geographical repartition. in line with this assumption, the low is density found in this new species suggests that it is less armed in tools that generate the diversity required to adapt to environmental changes that should however be balanced through large accessory gene sets acquisition capacities. further studies aiming at clarifying the structure of their genomes and their evolution will be needed to address such questions.
