BACKGROUND
with a limited number of genes, cells have to effectively coordinate their responses to diverse perturbations. different stimuli could activate the same molecular pathways and thus induce overlapping sets of genes. a classic example is response to cold, drought and salt stress in plants  <cit> . evoking an opposite response might be beneficial in other circumstances. the myc pathway, for example, induces proliferative growth under favourable conditions, but is suppressed by many stresses such as inflammation  <cit> . studying correlations between these diverse responses compliments in-depth investigations focused on cellular responses to individual stimuli and will enhance understanding of complex regulatory mechanisms.

there are many examples of the co-regulation of the same set of genes in different biological processes. for example, chang et al. observed that the gene expression signature of serum response in fibroblast predicts cancer progression  <cit> . similarly, diverse signaling pathways activated by growth factors induce broadly overlapping sets of genes  <cit> . ben-porath et al. found that genes over-expressed in histologically poorly differentiated tumors are enriched with genes highly expressed in embryonic stem cells  <cit> . on a larger scale, the connectivity map  <cit>  provides a database of expression profiles of cultured cells treated with various compounds for the detection of associations of small molecules with similar mechanism of action. these studies are all based on the analyses of gene expression data and provide important insight into the relationship between different molecular pathways.

the objective of this study is to systematically compare published gene sets and create a "molecular signature map" that highlights correlations between diverse cellular perturbations. published gene lists, however, are not readily available in a single source; they currently exist in scattered journal articles in diverse formats. the painstaking task of extracting this information manually has been attempted  <cit> . the l2l database represents the first systematic effort to collect lists of differentially expressed genes from microarray studies, which currently includes about  <dig> mammalian gene sets  <cit> . oncomine is a web-based database system that focuses on cancer related genomics data and includes both raw microarray data and gene sets   <cit> . the molecular signatures database  was constructed as a knowledgebase for the popular pathway analysis program known as gene set enrichment analysis   <cit> . most of the l2l information is included in msigdb, which is by far the most comprehensive source of published human gene sets.

furthermore, several tools to analyze gene lists data have been developed. both the l2l and msigdb web sites provide user interfaces to detect significant overlap of gene lists with their database. a similar approach, known as molecular concept analysis, is available at the oncomine web site. in addition to using published gene sets, users can also compare their lists against functional gene sets, such as those derived from gene ontology , kegg, etc. such analyses will broaden understanding of gene sets and their relationships with various pathways and functional categories.

this work is an effort to study the whole picture of overlapping gene lists. this comprehensive analysis of msigdb gene sets related to chemical and genetic perturbations will provide insights on the relationship of diverse cellular processes. by representing overlaps between gene sets as networks, we focus on the interpretation of the connections among diverse gene sets by taking advantage of the methods for visualizing and analyzing complex biological networks.

RESULTS
thousands of significant overlaps are identified
the version  <dig>  of msigdb contains  <dig>  gene sets in the "c2: chemical and genetic perturbations" category  <cit> , manually compiled from over  <dig> publications. it represents an important source of accumulated knowledge of the molecular signatures of various genetic and chemical perturbations. except for about  <dig> gene sets that are based on mouse studies, most of the sets are derived from studies using human tissues or cells. the total number of distinct genes across gene sets in all publications is  <dig> . each gene set has a name like "coller_myc_dn," where coller is the first author of the publication  <cit>  followed by a brief description of the set, such as "genes down-regulated by myc in 293t ."

the  <dig>  gene sets have a median size of  <dig>  but vary greatly from  <dig> to  <dig>  genes. interestingly, the distribution is close to normal on a log scale . some of the most frequently appearing genes in these gene sets are cytokines and growth factors . as suggested by the number of pubmed records associated with each of the genes, most of the top genes have been studied extensively . myc, stat <dig>  and id <dig> are the three most common genes in published gene sets in msigdb. interestingly, the transcriptional repressor id <dig>  is frequently identified as differentially expressed, even though it has been investigated in relatively few studies.

gene
we carried out a comprehensive all-vs.-all comparison of the  <dig>  published gene sets using a perl script . based on the hypergeometric distribution, we then calculated the likelihood of observing the number of overlapping genes if these two gene sets are randomly drawn without replacement from a collection of  <dig>  genes.

using the bonferroni correction for multiple testing, we multiplied p values by the total number of comparisons. after correction, the number of significant overlaps is  <dig> . some extremely significant  overlaps are apparently justified by the biology. for example,  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes in the gene set "chang_serum_response_up" are shared with "serum_fibroblast_core_up", which only has  <dig> genes. therefore, even with the most conservative correction, thousands of significant overlaps can be identified.

since the bonferroni correction could be too conservative, we used the false discovery rate  procedure  <cit>  in further analysis. although the tests are not statistically independent due to the overlaps between sets, the dependency should be considered a positive correlation, and the fdr procedure is applicable  <cit> . the raw p-values were translated into fdr to correct for multiple testing  <cit> . overlaps between gene sets from the same study were considered trivial and were removed. with fdr <  <dig>  as a cut-off, we identified  <dig> significant overlaps between  <dig> gene sets.

to further validate the significance of these overlaps, we used the same criteria to detect overlaps from data generated under the null hypothesis. we generated  <dig>  gene sets of the same sizes as those in msigdb but with genes drawn randomly from a pool of  <dig>  distinct genes. with fdr <  <dig>  as the cut-off, no significant overlap was identified. the same results hold in five repeated simulations. this simulation demonstrated the significance of the  <dig>  overlaps in msigdb.

modular organization of the gene set overlapping network
our results can be conveniently represented by an undirected network, where nodes correspond to gene sets and edges indicate significant overlaps . an annotated version of this network with detailed information on gene sets and overlaps can be found in additional file  <dig>  this file can be read by the cytoscape software   <cit>  for easy access and exploration. this same information is also provided as an excel file . this network highlights correlations across expression signatures of diverse biological processes, diseases, and cellular stimuli. this big network thus constitutes a "molecular signature map," in which individual perturbations are placed in the context defined by all others.

this is a highly connected network with an average of  <dig>  connections per gene set. surprisingly, most  of the  <dig> gene sets are connected to a dominant main network. in this network, while most nodes are connected to a small number of other gene sets, there are a small number of gene sets that significantly overlap with a large number of gene sets. this is similar to what has been observed in many biological networks.

one noticeable feature of the molecular signature map in figure  <dig> is its modularity. we observed several clusters of highly connected expression signatures. an efficient way to organize a large number of responses to diverse perturbations is to organize these responses into modules. figure  <dig> supports the notion that cells coordinate their responses to various stimuli by the combination of multiple modules.

to identify these modules, or highly interconnected sub-networks, we used the mcode algorithm  <cit>  to analyze the network of  <dig> nodes. we identified  <dig> sub-networks with four nodes or more. the biggest sub-network was further partitioned into two due to its size and topology. thus, we obtained a total of  <dig> sub-networks. table  <dig> lists these sub-networks with detailed information on both biological themes and the most frequent genes. these are the modules that cells use to remain viable in diverse environments.

cluster density is defined by dividing the number of significant overlaps  by the number of gene sets within the sub-network.

* less than  <dig> genes.

many of these highly connected sub-networks reveal clusters of gene sets derived from biologically similar perturbations. this is evident from the coherent go terms enriched in genes shared by gene sets within sub-networks . we extracted  <dig> most frequently appearing genes in each sub-network and conducted enrichment analyses based on go terms. see additional file  <dig> for the full list of these top genes in each module.

some unexpected links reveal interesting similarities in cellular responses to very different stimuli. we will discuss several of these sub-networks in the following sections. additional sub-networks are discussed in additional file  <dig>  for each sub-network, we examine one or more examples of overlapping gene sets in details. these examples are summarized in table  <dig> 

c-myc oncoprotein and its relationships to serum stimulation and interferon γ
some of the sub-networks confirm the overlapping of genes in studies investigating similar perturbations. one example is shown in figure 2a . four of the seven gene sets in this sub-network are clearly marked as target genes or are upregulated by oncoprotein c-myc. the gene set of basso et al. deals with hubs in gene regulatory networks; myc is identified as a major hub  <cit> . basso et al. also noticed that a significant proportion of myc target genes are regulatory hubs  <cit> . therefore, not surprisingly, the regulatory hubs are enriched with myc targets. significant overlaps between these five studies of myc related genes are identified by our analysis, which reassures us that our analysis can identify biologically related gene sets.

this sub-network also highlights a gene set of serum response genes that overlaps with myc gene sets  <cit> . the c-myc oncogene is known to mediate responses to serum stimulation  <cit>  and trigger proliferative growth in a favourable environment. the overlaps between two myc target gene sets and genes downregulated by interferon γ  were unexpected. however, as ifng inhibits cell growth through suppression of c-myc expression  <cit> , upregulation of ifng causes downregulation of myc target genes. we could generalize that overlaps between a set of "x upregulated genes" with "y downregulated genes" possibly indicate repressive interactions between factors x and y. such overlaps are highlighted in dashed red lines in the networks.

we conclude that most of the gene sets in this sub-network are directly or indirectly related to myc protein. figure 2b shows the list of  <dig> genes that appear three times or more in these seven gene sets. we think this could be a reliable list of myc target genes based on multiple publications.

a sub-network for pathogen response
another example of a similar perturbation is shown in figure  <dig>  which corresponds to sub-network # <dig> in table  <dig>  as this sub-network is so densely connected, only overlaps with extremely high significance  are shown. most of the  <dig> gene sets in this sub-network are regulated by interferons α and β that mediate response to pathogens. overlaps among these sets are remarkably significant. for example,  <dig> out of the  <dig> der_ifna_up genes are also included in the  <dig> genes in ifn_beta_up.

correlations between several other gene sets and interferon α and β pathways are not obvious. the "takeda_nup9_hoxa9_3d_up" gene set includes genes upregulated by the fusion protein nup98-hoxa <dig>  which occurs in acute myeloid leukemia  <cit> . takeda et al. noted that transduction of this fusion protein induces "upregulation of ifnβ <dig> and is accompanied by marked upregulation of ifn-induced genes"  <cit> . thus, their gene list must contain infb target genes. the "bennett_sle_up" gene set includes genes significantly up-regulated by systemic lupus erythematosus  patients  <cit> . the major conclusion and surprising finding of this study are that the sle active expression profile is "distinguished by a remarkably homogeneous gene expression pattern with overexpression of granulopoiesis-related and interferon -induced genes"  <cit> . finally, seven gene lists in this sub-network are related to cmv  infection  <cit> . the finding that these gene sets are highly significantly related to ifn-induced genes indicates that host cell response to cmv infection might be mediated by these cytokines.

we further investigated whether the genes that are frequently shared by gene sets in this sub-network have coherent biological functions. the most significantly enriched functional category is "response to virus" , followed by "immune response" . out of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> and  <dig> are associated with "response to virus" and "immune responses", respectively . these results indicate that the gene lists in this sub-network are dominated by immune responses triggered by various conditions.

stem cell related genes as predictors of poor prognosis for breast cancer
sub-network # <dig> in table  <dig> includes diverse gene sets . the "stemcell_neural_up" set includes  <dig>  genes highly expressed in mouse neural stem cells, compared to differentiated brain and bone marrow cells  <cit> . another related set from the same study is "stemcell_embryonic_up" representing genes enriched in embryonic stem cells. interestingly, these gene sets intersect significantly with genes associated with poor prognosis in breast cancers. the "brca_prognosis_neg" and "vant veer_breast_outcome_good_vs_poor_dn" are derived from the same publication  <cit>  and are extracted from the same list of genes whose higher expression predicts poor outcome. the latter includes many genes represented by clone ids not properly mapped to gene symbols.

the overlap between stem cell and breast cancer prognosis genes is highly significant:  <dig>  of the  <dig> genes in "brca_prognosis_neg" are highly expressed in embryonic stem cells . these  <dig> genes are enriched with  <dig> cell cycle related genes ,  <dig> of which are related to organelle parts of cell structure . the significant overlap between breast cancer prognosis genes and stem cell genes thus highlights the similarity in expression profiles between aggressive tumors and stem cells. this is supported by a more in-depth meta-analysis of gene expression data  <cit> .

another interesting overlap is between stem cell gene lists with genes down-regulated by hypoxia. thirty eight  of the  <dig> genes in "manalo_hypoxia_dn" set are included in "stem_cell_embryonic_up" with fdr < <dig> × 10- <dig>  of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> are related to go term "dna replication" with benjamini p value < <dig>  × 10- <dig>  cell cycle genes are also enriched. one of the overlapped genes is brca <dig>  other lists in this cluster include "genotoxins_all_4hrs_reg," which is a list of genes that are commonly regulated by six types of genotoxins  <cit> . the overlapped genes are also mostly cell cycle related, including bub <dig>  cdc <dig>  ccnb <dig>  etc. the "le_myelin_up" set contains genes upregulated after sciatic nerve injury. thus, these genes might be related to growth after wounding.

we also compared gene lists in this sub-network with sets of genes  recently identified as breast cancer prognostic markers by li et al.  <cit> . we identified modestly significant  overlaps between three gene sets in this subnetwork with two gene sets related to cell cycle  and one related to cell growth . see additional file 1: figure s <dig> for more information. these overlaps again suggest that cell cycle genes are important in predicting breast cancer survival. but further study is clearly needed to systematically compare the nrc and other breast cancer related gene sets, many of which are not included in the version  <dig>  of msigdb database.

glutamine starvation strongly downregulates myc target genes
sub-network # <dig> in table  <dig> is shown in figure  <dig>  and includes diverse gene sets ranging from ultraviolet  treatment, glutamine starvation, brca <dig> overexpression, etc. the connection between "appel_imatinib_up" and "li_fetal_vs_wt_kidney_up" confirms the regulation of differentiation by imatinib, a new tyrosine kinase inhibitor. imatinib can inhibit dendritic cell differentiation  <cit> . the "li_fetal_vs_wt_kidney_dn" gene set represents genes highly expressed in wilms' tumor  compared with fetal kidneys  <cit> . wt is characterized by arrested cellular differentiation. even though the cells/tissues are different in these two studies, we were able to detect this moderately significant overlap.

we focus our attention on the "peng_glutamine_dn" gene list that is associated with glutamine starvation in human bjab b-lymphoma cells  <cit> . an unexpected connection is that genes downregulated by glutamine starvation contain many myc target genes. in the whole network this is most evident as the "peng_glutamine_dn" list significantly overlaps with almost all myc related gene sets. the neighborhood of this gene set is in the molecular signature map in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  yuneva et al. showed that glutamine but not glucose starvation induces myc-dependent apoptosis in human cancer cells  <cit> , but the mechanism is unknown. on the other hand, wise et al. found that overexpression of myc promotes glutaminolysis and leads to cellular addiction to glutamine in cancer cells  <cit> . these study results may lead to the development of targeted killing of cancer cells that rely on high levels of glutamine uptake. we found no report on whether glutamine starvation inhibits the myc pathway. if this is indeed true, as suggested by the overlapping of these gene sets, then the closely related nature of glutamine metabolism and the myc pathway will need to be evaluated more closely.

to further confirm the link between glutamine deprivation and the myc pathway, we downloaded and re-analyzed the raw dna microarray data on glutamine starvation  <cit> . using the gsea program, we analyzed the whole dataset for enriched gene sets. the enriched gene sets are shown as additional file 1: table s <dig>  one pathway that showed up is the proteosome degradation pathway, in which nutrient deficient cells suppress protein degradation as a means for survival. the most noticeable pathways are multiple myc target gene sets downregulated at highly significant levels, confirming our observation based on gene set overlaps.

glutamine starvation triggers a complex network of transcription factors including atfs and c/ebp factors, and such response might be cell line- or species-dependent . indeed, our further analysis of another set of dna microarray data  <cit>  suggests that glutamine starvation does not cause downregulation of myc target genes in mouse hepatoma cells . however, for this specific b-lymphoma cell line studied by peng et al.  <cit> , the suppression of the myc pathway is strongly supported by gene set overlaps and raw dna microarray data analysis.

repressive interactions between pathways
interestingly, we identified thousands of overlaps corresponding to repressive interactions between different pathways. these are marked by overlaps between a set of genes downregulated by factor "x"  and another set of genes upregulated by factor "y" . among the total of  <dig>  significant overlaps identified,  <dig>   belong to this category . for comparison,  <dig>   overlaps are explicitly in the same direction .

besides the ifng and myc, several examples are discussed in previous sections . these include the overlap between p53_genes_all and zeller_myc_dn, which is supported by the fact that p <dig> represses the myc oncogene  <cit> . additional file  <dig> includes many repressive overlaps not discussed. one of the very significant repressive overlaps, for example, is between alzheimers_disease_dn and stemcell_neural_up. there are  <dig> genes that were found to be downregulated in alzheimer's disease but were upregulated in neural stem cells. detailed go analysis shows that these genes are enriched with ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process . this is consistent with the notion that alzheimer's disease is one of disorders related to ubiquitin protein catabolic process  <cit> .

the prevalence of repressive interactions among various molecular pathways highlights the complexity of cellular control machinery. this result also suggests the necessity of paying close attention to the downregulated genes and cross-checking them with upregulated genes in other situations.

discussion
the highly connected nature of the  <dig>  gene sets is surprising. an average gene set overlaps with more than seven gene sets, above a significant level of fdr <  <dig> . moreover, the majority  of the  <dig>  gene sets are connected directly or indirectly as one big network. in other words, any newly defined gene sets will have approximately an 80% chance of having at least one significant overlap with a gene set in msigdb database. our results suggest that many seemingly unrelated stimuli/perturbations may activate or deactivate the same molecular pathways. we have discussed several unexpected overlaps in our paper while analyzing sub-networks in previous sections. one example is the shared genes among myc target genes, serum stimulation, and interferon gamma over-expression. our data-driven analysis confirms the connection between them: serum stimulation and interferon gamma up- and down-regulates myc target genes, respectively.

the observation that most of the gene sets are connected to one dominant network can be explained in several ways. researchers might be biased and focus on a small set of essential processes in cells, which would give rise to a connected network. similarly, the msigdb could have been selectively compiled. another explanation for the observation is that cells respond to diverse perturbations with overlapping genes, resulting in the observed heavily connected networks. this explains the myc pathway involvement in response to diverse stimuli. we believe that all of these factors contribute to the connectivity of the network.

an implication from this finding is to compare new gene lists obtained from genomics studies to big databases of previously published gene sets. interpretation of gene lists remains a challenge in high-throughput genomics studies. algorithms and databases are available and can be used to detect overrepresented genes belonging to the same pathway, go category, target genes of transcription factors, etc. alternatively, new gene lists can be compared with all published gene lists. our analysis showed that very different biological processes can share a gene expression signature. comparison with thousands of published gene sets will help in the interpretation of new gene lists, with the contextual molecular perturbation map. this is indeed similar to queries of nucleic acid sequence databases for the annotation of new sequence entries. msigdb already has a user-friendly interface that enables users to upload their gene lists and compare them with all archived gene sets.

one of the drawbacks of this study is that we used gene sets from both human and mouse studies, and comparisons within the same species often involved different types of tissues or even cell lines. we included as many gene sets as possible based on the rationale that a) overlaps between divergent molecular pathways in these species/tissues would not be detected and b) significant overlaps, once detected, would suggest conserved molecular mechanisms across species/tissues. there are some evidence based on studies of yeast  <cit>  and bacteria  <cit>  suggesting that gene regulatory networks are remarkably flexible, and large scale rewiring is possible. another limitation of this study is that our results, the highly connected modules of gene lists, were mainly validated through speculative discussions based on literature. we discussed only a subset of the modules that we deemed interesting. two additional sub-networks related to p <dig> signalling and cell differentiation are discussed in additional file  <dig>  further study is clearly needed to verify the identified links between diverse biological perturbations.

CONCLUSIONS
despite the fact that dna microarray studies might be inconsistent across laboratories  <cit> , we identified thousands of statistically significant overlaps between published gene lists. summarized as a molecular signature map, our results provide key insights into underlying connections of diverse perturbations. we have found evidence that the molecular signature map is 1) highly interconnected, suggesting that overlapping sets of genes are used over and over again by cells to respond to various stimuli, and 2) modularly organized, suggesting that different responses are coordinated via functional modules.
