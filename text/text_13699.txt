BACKGROUND
the climatic oscillation and the related ecological changes around the last glacial maximum )  <cit>  were suggested to exert substantial influence on prehistoric migrations and demographic changes in modern humans  <cit> . in east asia, archaeological studies have indicated that great changes occurred in the wake of the lgm  <cit> . for instance, the microblade technology appeared and became popular during the lgm in northern china  <cit> ; some early settlements were abandoned  <cit>  and people probably moved to the south due to the deteriorating environmental conditions  <cit> . after the lgm, improved climate allowed humans to re-colonize the high latitude regions  <cit> . however, whether the ancient dispersals around the lgm left any detectable genetic footprints in the gene pool of the contemporary east asians was still elusive.

in the past decades, genetic data of mitochondrial dna  and the non-recombining region of y-chromosome  have been widely employed to reconstruct human prehistory  <cit> . in europe, the detailed phylogeographic dissection of matrilineal pools has discerned some haplogroups as the candidate markers for tracing the dispersal after the lgm, which could be assigned as the late glacial  and the post-glacial  re-colonization, respectively  <cit> . recently, this strategy has also been applied to other regions , yielding many valuable insights into the prehistoric demographic events around the lgm.

to trace the ancient dispersal of modern humans in east asia around the lgm, we carried out a detailed phylogeographic analysis on a high resolution mtdna marker. we focused our attention particularly on east eurasian specific mtdna haplogroup m9a'b for four reasons: 1) m9a'b distributes widely in mainland east asia  <cit>  and is relatively concentrated in tibet   <cit>  and its surrounding regions, including nepal   <cit> , sikkim   <cit>  and northeast india   <cit> . 2) the phylogeny of haplogroup m9a'b indicated that this clade might be involved in some northward migrations into east asia from southeast asia  <cit> . 3) the coalescent time estimates of certain sub-haplogroups of m9a'b, for example, m9a   <cit>  and m9d   <cit> , suggested that these lineages were likely associated with some post-lgm dispersal in east asia  <cit> , especially in tibet  <cit> . 4) in addition to its high frequency, the relatively high genetic diversity, as revealed by the mtdna control region hypervariable segment i  information in tibet  <cit> , suggested that tibet might serve as the potential differentiation center of m9a'b sub-haplogroups. all these lines of evidence appeared to imply that tibet might be a candidate source for the post-lgm dispersal in east asia. together, the detailed dissection of haplogroup m9a'b would provide insightful information for the ancient movement of modern humans in east asia around the lgm.

RESULTS
m9a'b phylogenetic tree based on mtdna genome information
after incorporating the  <dig> newly sequenced mtdna genomes, the phylogeny of haplogroup m9a'b was greatly improved in the context of east eurasians . the overall structure of the tree turned out to be much more complex than we had ever thought  <cit>  . for instance, a number of basal lineages branched directly from the m9a'b root and shared merely two variants  <dig> and  <dig> with previously defined haplogroups m9a and m9d  <cit> . to update the definitions of haplogroup m9a'b and its sub-haplogroups and to avoid potential confusion, we kept the definition of m9a'b, but expanded that of m9a  to embrace m9a <dig> , m9a <dig> , and m9a <dig> . nomenclature of some other sub-haplogroups, such as m9a1b , m9a1a <dig> , and m9a1a <dig> , were adjusted accordingly . it should be mentioned that although the validity of m9a1a might be questionable because this haplogroup was defined solely by a control region variation at site  <dig>  its two major clades  were determined by additional coding region variants. the updated nomenclature has been deposited to phylotree   <cit> .

based on the updated m9a'b phylogeny, some interesting features could be discerned. with the exception of m9a <dig>  most basal branches of m9a were distributed in southern china  and southeast asia ; this pattern suggested that m9a might have a southern origin. the distribution pattern of m9a <dig> was rather complex: although this haplogroup did bear some genetic imprints of southern origin by harboring a basal lineage  from southern china, its effect had actually extended to northern china and japan , as well as, western china , northeast india , and the south himalaya region . based on this pattern, it seemed that haplogroup m9a <dig> had most likely been involved in some northward and westward dispersal in east asia.

phylogeographic distribution
the updated phylogenetic tree of haplogroup m9a'b provided a basis for us to reanalyze the previously published data and to perform a well-defined phylogeographic analysis of this haplogroup. to better characterize the demographic history of m9a'b, the median-joining network was constructed based on all available m9a'b mtdnas . in general, the network  was in agreement with the phylogeny of the entire mtdna genomes . our comprehensive study of haplogroup m9a'b substantiated the notion that the origin of this haplogroup was most likely located in southern china and/or mainland southeast asia. as displayed in figure  <dig>  most of the basal lineages within m9a  came from southern china, southwestern china, and southeast asia, strongly suggesting a southern origin of m9a. this result received further support from m9b:  <dig> of the  <dig> m9b sequences were observed in southern china, southwestern china, and southeast asia, while the remaining two were found in northwestern china and northern china, respectively .

similar to the observation from the phylogenetic tree of the complete mtdnas , the median-network showed that the dominant clade  within m9a presented a quite different geographic distribution pattern from its sister cluster m9a* . within haplogroup m9a1b, the basal lineages were mainly restricted to western china and myanmar, whereas m9a1b <dig> spread not only in western china and myanmar, but also in northeast india and the south himalaya region . the basal lineages belonging to m9a1a* were mainly found in southern china . one of its derivatives, haplogroup m9a1a <dig>  displayed a restricted distribution in western china, myanmar, northeast india, and the south himalaya region , and presented a similar pattern to that of haplogroup m9a1b <dig>  nevertheless, haplogroup m9a1a <dig> showed a distinct distribution pattern: most of m9a1a <dig> basal lineages were distributed in southern china, southwestern china, as well as, northern china, japan and korea, whereas its major sub-haplogroup m9a1a1c was prevalent in northern china, korea, and japan . remarkably, the m9a1a <dig> lineages found in tibet were almost clustered into haplogroup m9a1a1c1b.

coalescence age estimates
the large number of m9a'b samples with complete mtdna genome information, as well as the network with a high-resolution, allowed us to estimate the coalescence ages of the nodes  of interest. although there were some exceptions, the estimated ages based on different calibrated rates were in general accordance with each other and seemed to be quite robust . the whole haplogroup m9a'b showed a coalescence time of approximately  <dig> to  <dig> kya. the estimated coalescence age of haplogroup m9a was approximately  <dig> to  <dig> kya. within haplogroup m9a <dig>  haplogroups m9a1a <dig> and m9a1b <dig> emerged around  <dig> to  <dig> kya and  <dig> to  <dig> kya, respectively. for haplogroup m9a1a <dig>  because of the small number of available mtdna genome sequences, which would bias the age estimates, we adopted the age estimation result based on hvs-i data . as a result, nearly all the age estimates placed the origin of haplogroup m9a1a <dig> in the late glacial episode, whereas haplogroups m9a1b <dig> and m9a1a <dig> are in a more recent post-glacial period , despite a fact that these ages should be received with caution  <cit> .

discussion
although some previous studies based on limited information from mtdna control region suggested that haplogroup m9a'b might trace its origin in north asia/northern china  <cit>  or central asia   <cit> , evidence from entire mtdna genomes and extensive phylogeographic analyses unanimously indicated that this haplogroup was originated in southern china and/or southeast asia, a vast region containing contemporary northern vietnam and south china . this result was consistent with the previous observation on haplogroup e, the sister clade of m9a'b  <cit> , and thus provided further evidence in support of the common origin of haplogroup m <dig>  in southeast asia  <cit> . moreover, the emergence of m9a'b and/or m9a and their related early dispersal in southern china and/or southeast asia  around  <dig> to  <dig> kya  was in agreement with the rise of the upper paleolithic culture within this region . during this period, the first  and second  stages of bailiandong culture in guangxi  <cit>  and the son vi culture  in northern vietnam  <cit>  appeared and showed tight links  with each other  <cit> .

our phylogeographic analysis of haplogroup m9a'b further revealed some distinct distribution patterns of its sub-haplogroups. in particular, m9a1b and m9a1a <dig> showed a restricted distribution in western china, myanmar, northeast india, and the south himalaya region , but were virtually very rare or absent in northern china and northeast asia and even southern china , indicating that both haplogroups might have distinct origins from the other m9a'b sub-haplogroups. meanwhile, m9a1a <dig> and m9a1b coincidentally shared a similar expansion age , which indicated that both haplogroups might have been involved in the same demographic event. together, the current distribution pattern of haplogroups m9a1b and m9a1a <dig> was likely attributed to an inland post-glacial dispersal event, which started from southern china along with the differentiation of m9a <dig> , then moved westward to western china, and finally to northeast india and the south himalaya region . nevertheless, the phylogeographic pattern of m9a1a <dig> suggested some northward late glacial dispersal. in particular, the enrichment of haplogroup m9a1a1c1b in tibet was likely to be explained by some recent local expansions, such as the neolithic expansion  <cit>  in this region.

it is possible that the observed pattern based on a single haplogroup  might be biased by genetic drift, natural selection, and later population dynamic events  <cit> . so we tried to look for the parallel genetic evidence from the published data: haplogroup f1c  <cit> , with mtdna control region motif as 16111-16129-16304-152-249d, was found to show a similar phylogeographic pattern with haplogroup m9a <dig>  as previous studies had indicated that haplogroups f <dig> and f1a  probably had an origin in southern china and/or southeast asia  <cit> , haplogroup f1c also probably originated in the same region. the network based on  <dig> mtdna control region sequences  suggested that several branches derived directly from the root type of f1c, and these lineages were mainly restricted in western china, northeast india, and the south himalaya region . regardless of the major branch defined by variant  <dig>  the expansion time of haplogroup  f1c* was estimated to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kya. therefore, the differentiation of haplogroup f1c* had likely witnessed certain inland post-glacial dispersal from southern china and/or southwestern china to northeast india and the south himalaya region, which mirrored the distribution pattern of m9a1b and m9a1a <dig> 

the proper interpretation of the obtained genetic data to reconstruct complex colonization scenarios would benefit from the incorporation of archaeological materials. after the lgm, around  <dig> to  <dig> kya, great cultural changes in south china and northern vietnam were suggested to be associated with the prevalence of the mesolithic culture, such as the hoabinhian culture  <cit>  and the third stage of bailiandong culture  <cit> . the expansions of these mesolithic cultures in southern china and southeast asia were already discussed in some recent studies  <cit> . intriguingly, the timing for our proposed inland post-glacial dispersal scenario was largely overlapped with the mesolithic period, and more importantly, this inland route from southwestern china to northeast india and the south himalaya region was in coincidence with the hoabinhian links connecting southwestern china  <cit> , northeast india  <cit> , and nepal  <cit>  . it seemed that the advanced technology  and the improved climate would be the major factors in triggering the post-glacial dispersal. however, other factors such as the dispersal of language groups and the expansion of agriculture could not be neglected completely. considering some major branches within m9a'b were relatively concentrated in different tibeto-burman and khasi-khmuic populations , the dispersals of tibeto-burman  <cit>  and austro-asiatic populations  <cit> , together with the intergroup genetic admixture  <cit> , were likely to shape the current distribution pattern of m9a'b. further work on more genetic markers  with extensive sampling will be required to further confirm our speculation regarding the prehistoric peopling scenario in east asia.

CONCLUSIONS
our comprehensive phylogeographic analyses of mtdna haplogroup m9a'b revealed that southern china and/or southeast asia served as a source of the post-lgm dispersal in east asia. most importantly, our results provided the first direct genetic evidence in support of the existence of an inland dispersal in mainland east asia from southern china, through western china, to northeast india and the south himalaya region. this dispersal was likely triggered by the improved climate and the advanced mesolithic culture, and had played important roles in shaping the matrilineal gene pool of modern east asians.
