BACKGROUND
transient receptor potential canonical channel  <dig>  is one of seven members of the canonical transient receptor potential  family of calcium-permeable cation channels that allow for an increase in intracellular calcium following activation of g-protein coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases  <cit> . trpc channel subunits assemble to form homo- and/or hetero-tetramers  <cit> . each trpc subunit contains intracellular amino and carboxyl-terminal domains flanking six transmembrane domains; the intracellular sequences host canonical protein-protein interaction domains, including ankyrin-like repeats and a coiled-coil region in the amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain, and carboxyl-terminal trp box, cirb  sequence, and a coiled-coil region  <cit> . multiple proteins have been shown to bind to trpc <dig>  including bkca <cit> , calmodulin  <cit> , fkbp <dig>  <cit> , fyn  <cit> , ip <dig> receptor  <cit> , mxa  <cit> , the na+/k+-atpase pump  <cit> , plcγ  <cit> , podocin  <cit> , pten  <cit> , and rnf <dig>  <cit> . in addition, trpc <dig> channel activity can be modulated by tyrosine  <cit>  and serine/threonine phosphorylation  <cit> , and by binding of phosphoinositides  <cit> . however, how these various post-translational modifications and interacting partners ultimately alter channel activity has not been fully elucidated.

trpc <dig> has been implicated in several physiological and pathophysiological functions in the kidney, heart and vasculature. mutations in trpc <dig> are a cause of familial, autosomal-dominant, adult-onset focal segmental glomerulosclerosis , a form of proteinuric renal disease  <cit> , and increased trpc <dig> expression has been observed in acquired proteinuric kidney disease  <cit> . in contrast, trpc6-deficient mice show mild protection against angiotensin ii mediated glomerular damage  <cit> . the majority of fsgs-associated mutations appear to be gain-of-function, with increased channel current amplitudes and reduced current decay having been reported  <cit> . as all currently identified fsgs disease-associated trpc <dig> mutations map to the intracellular domains of the channel, it has been hypothesized that these mutations may act by disrupting the binding of regulatory proteins to trpc <dig>  with the slit diaphragm protein nephrin proposed as one such protein  <cit> . how enhanced trpc <dig> activity leads to renal disease, though, remains unknown. in contrast, in the heart upregulation of trpc <dig> has been linked to the development of pathologic cardiac hypertrophy through activation of the calcineurin-nfat pathway  <cit> . finally, examinations of trpc6-deficient mice have suggested roles in hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction  <cit> , the development of pulmonary edema in response to ischemia-reperfusion injury  <cit> , and platelet function  <cit> .

to discover novel binding partners of trpc <dig>  we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the amino-terminal domain of trpc <dig> as bait and isolated snf <dig> as a trpc <dig> binding partner. snf <dig> is the mammalian counterpart to yeast vps <dig>  a component of the escrt-ii endosomal trafficking complex required for the endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of transmembrane proteins  <cit> . the snf8-trpc <dig> interaction was mapped to the first  <dig> residues of the n-terminus of trpc <dig>  and was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation as well as immunofluorescence microscopy. additionally, overexpression and rnai-mediated knockdown of snf <dig> in tissue culture reveals a modulatory effect on wild-type and mutant trpc <dig> channel activity as evidenced by whole-cell electrophysiology studies and transcriptional luciferase reporter assays.

RESULTS
snf <dig> binds to the amino-terminus of trpc <dig> in the yeast two-hybrid system
the amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain of human trpc <dig>  was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify potential trpc <dig> interacting proteins in a human kidney cdna library. on the basis of both nutritional selection and β-galactosidase activity,  <dig> clones of snf <dig>  were isolated; all clones included the entire coding sequence of snf <dig> and varying lengths of 5′ utr. full-length snf <dig> fused to the gal <dig> activation domain was able to interact with the amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain, but not the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of trpc <dig> in the yeast two-hybrid system as assessed by growth on histidine and adenine free media  and β-galactosidase activity . using truncation mutants of the amino-terminal of trpc <dig>  it was found that amino acids 1- <dig>  containing the sequence prior to the ankyrin repeats, are necessary and sufficient for this interaction .


trpc <dig> and snf <dig> interact in mammalian cells
to confirm that the interaction between trpc <dig> and snf <dig> can occur in a cellular context, cells stably expressing flag-tagged trpc <dig> under a tetracycline inducible promoter were transfected with ha-tagged snf <dig>  trpc <dig> was immunoprecipitated with the flag m <dig> monoclonal antibody, and the presence of snf <dig> in the isolated immune complexes was assessed by western blot using an anti-ha antibody . ha-snf <dig> was detected in the immunoprecipitated material only when co-expressed with flag-trpc <dig>  we have not been able to confirm the interaction by co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous snf <dig> and trpc <dig>  but this may be due at least in part due to the limited availability of high quality antibodies to detect endogenous snf <dig>  or a relatively low affinity interaction between the two proteins.


to assess if the interaction between the two proteins might be influenced by trpc <dig> channel activation, cells co-expressing both proteins were treated with or without carbachol to activate trpc <dig> prior to cell lysis and immunoprecipitation. no notable difference in the amount of snf <dig> in the immune complexes was seen upon carbachol stimulation . this suggests that channel activity or calcium influx is not required for the establishment of this interaction.

to further confirm the potential interaction between snf <dig> and trpc <dig>  the localization of the two overexpressed proteins was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. overall, there was little colocalization of the two signals, though small punctate regions suggesting areas of colocalization of the two proteins were seen in most cells examined .


snf <dig> enhances trpc6-mediated current
to address whether snf <dig> may play a role in the regulation of trpc <dig> activity, we performed electrophysiology experiments in the whole cell configuration in hek293t cells expressing the muscarinic m <dig> acetylcholine receptor and either trpc <dig> and snf <dig>  or trpc <dig> alone. activation of the m <dig> receptor with carbachol resulted in a whole cell current with a characteristic current-voltage relationship for trpc6: a small inward and a steeply outwardly rectifying component. co-expression of snf <dig> led to increased whole cell current amplitude in both the inward and outward directions . the ability of snf <dig> to enhance trpc6-mediated currents extended to channels containing an fsgs-associated mutation, e897k . this mutation was previously characterized as a gain-of-function mutation leading to increased whole cell current amplitude compared to wild-type controls  <cit> .


we attempted to ascertain whether the effect of snf <dig> on trpc <dig> was dependent on direct binding of the two proteins. a trpc <dig> construct lacking the amino terminal  <dig> amino acids , required for snf <dig> binding in the two hybrid assay, expressed at significantly lower levels than full-length trpc <dig>  though it was capable of forming multimers, based on its ability to co-immunoprecipitate full-length ha-tagged trpc <dig> . however, in contrast to full length trpc <dig>  the truncated protein failed to generate current in response to oag stimulation , preventing us from addressing whether the effect of snf <dig> on trpc <dig> currents was dependent on binding at this site. similarly, trpc <dig> 107- <dig> failed to generate significant current after stimulation with carbachol .


modulating snf <dig> levels alters nfat-mediated transcription downstream of mutant trpc6
we have previously demonstrated that several fsgs-associated mutations in trpc <dig> lead to activation of calcineurin-nfat signaling and nfat-mediated transcription in the absence of exogenous stimuli  <cit> . in light of the ability of snf <dig> to enhance trpc6-mediated whole cell currents, we examined the ability of snf <dig> overexpression to affect trpc <dig> mediated activation of nfat-mediated transcription . overexpression of snf <dig> in cells expressing either the r895c or e897k mutant trpc <dig> channels led to an increase in nfat-mediated transcription under unstimulated conditions. in contrast, in cells expressing wild-type trpc <dig>  which does not activate nfat-mediated transcription under unstimulated conditions, snf <dig> overexpression did not lead to activation of nfat-driven transcription. unfortunately, known activators of trpc <dig>  including carbachol and oag, are able to substantially increase nfat-mediated transcription in 293t cells even in the absence of exogenously expressed trpc <dig>  <cit> . therefore, we have not been able to ascertain whether overexpression of snf <dig> is able to enhance nfat activation by wild-type trpc <dig> after the channel has been activated. taken together with the electrophysiologic data, these results suggest that snf <dig> can enhance trpc6-mediated currents and downstream signaling pathways, but is not sufficient to activate the channel.


most of our current knowledge regarding snf <dig> relates to its function as part of the escrt-ii complex involved in transmembrane protein trafficking into multivesiculated bodies  <cit> . we therefore hypothesized that overexpression of snf <dig>  rather than increasing escrt-ii activity, might act in a dominant negative fashion by providing monomeric snf <dig> to compete with intact escrt-ii complex for trpc <dig> binding. to address this possibility, we made use of a short hairpin rna expressing plasmid to knock down snf <dig> protein levels in m1r cells. introducing the snf <dig> shrna expressing plasmid into cells expressing r895c mutant trpc <dig> led to a modest decrease in activity from an nfat-responsive luciferase reporter construct, compared to cells transfected with a control shrna plasmid . expression of the snf <dig> shrna did not significantly alter basal nfat-mediated transcription in control cells  or expressing wild-type trpc <dig> . western blot analysis confirmed a decrease in endogenous snf <dig> levels with the snf <dig> shrna expression plasmid compared to control . these results suggest that:  <dig>  the effects of overexpressed snf <dig> on trpc <dig> channel activity and signaling are not mediated by a dominant negative effect, and  <dig>  while snf <dig> may enhance trpc <dig> activity, it is likely not required for channel activity given the only modest decrease in nfat-reporter activity in response to snf <dig> knockdown in r895c expressing cells. confirmation of this later point will require the development of cells completely devoid of snf <dig> 

snf <dig> overexpression does not alter trpc <dig> content on the cell surface or in detergent resistant membranes
several trp channels, including trpc <dig>  have been reported to be regulated by altering their cell surface expression through regulated endo- and exocytosis  <cit> . mutations in snf <dig> have been reported to affect the transport kinetics of ena1p, a sodium pump in yeast  <cit> . we therefore wished to examine whether snf <dig> overexpression might alter trpc <dig> function by modulating the amount of channel expressed on the plasma membrane. m1r cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for flag-trpc <dig> and ha-snf <dig>  either in combination, or alone with control plasmid. after surface biotinylation of the cells, the amount of trpc <dig> bound to streptavidin beads  was compared to total trpc <dig> in whole cell lysates . co-expression of snf <dig> did not appreciably alter the amount of trpc <dig> bound to the streptavidin beads compared to total trpc <dig> levels. interestingly, small amounts of snf <dig> could also be detected in material bound to streptavidin beads , consistent with its recruitment to transmembrane proteins, including plasma membrane proteins. however, the amount of snf <dig> pulled down by streptavidin beads was not appreciably altered by the presence or absence of trpc <dig>  suggesting that cell surface proteins other than trpc <dig> were largely responsible for this effect.


several trpc proteins have been reported to partition into detergent-resistant membranes  <cit> , and tprc <dig> binds to caveolin- <dig>  a lipid raft-associated protein  <cit> . furthermore, stim <dig> overexpression was reported to shift trpc <dig> into lipid rafts, thereby altering its channel properties  <cit> . we therefore examined whether snf <dig> may alter the amount of trpc <dig> present in detergent-resistant membranes. in control cells, only a very small fraction of trpc <dig>  was detected in the fractions containing detergent-resistant membranes, as assayed by the presence of the lipid raft marker caveolin- <dig> , similar to previously reported results  <cit> . the amount of total trpc <dig> found in the low density fractions did not change appreciably when ha-snf <dig> was overexpressed . a small amount of snf <dig> was also detected in the detergent resistant membranes . it remains unclear why caveolin- <dig> localization peaked in fraction  <dig>  while trpc <dig> and snf <dig> in the low density fractions were mainly in fraction  <dig>  but the generation of distinct lipid raft subfractions has been reported using a protocol similar to the one used here  <cit> .


discussion
here we identify snf <dig> as a novel binding partner of trpc <dig>  the interaction was first established in a yeast two-hybrid screen, where it was found to be mediated by the amino terminal  <dig> amino acids of trpc <dig>  the trpc6-snf <dig> interaction has been confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation, and the proteins partially colocalize in cells. importantly, snf <dig> overexpression enhances whole cell current amplitudes mediated by both wild-type and fsgs-associated mutant trpc <dig>  as well as mutant trpc6-mediated nfat activation, while rnai mediated knock-down of endogenous snf <dig> diminishes nfat activation by mutant trpc <dig>  the effect of snf <dig> on trpc <dig> channel activity and downstream activation of nfat-mediated transcription does not appear to be mediated by alterations in the global surface expression levels of trpc <dig> or a shift of channel into lipid rafts. taken together, these results suggest a novel role for snf <dig> in the modulation of trpc <dig> channel activity.

it is difficult to reconcile the ability of snf <dig> to enhance trpc6-mediated current with its major known function, sorting transmembrane proteins into multivesiculated bodies for degradation. snf <dig>  together with vps <dig> and vps <dig>  forms the endosomal sorting complex for transport  -ii complex  <cit> . escrt-ii, in conjunction with the escrt-i and –iii complexes, is involved in the budding of intraluminal vesicles from endosomes to form multivesiculated bodies  . this process is critical for the downregulation of multiple signaling receptors, including the yeast mating receptor ste <dig>  <cit> , egfr <cit>  and notch  <cit> . the escrt complexes not only target ubiquitinated transmembrane proteins to the vesicles of the mvb, but induce the necessary membrane curvature and ultimate scission of the vesicles from their parent membrane  <cit> . in addition to their role in mvb formation, escrts are involved in the membrane scission required for cytokinesis and the budding of enveloped viruses  <cit> .

whether the endosomal-lysosomal functions of snf <dig> might relate to trpc <dig> activity is unclear. it is worth noting that snf <dig> has been implicated to have several non-endosomal functions. these include the establishment of the bicoid mrna gradient in the drosophila oocyte  <cit>  and modulation of the ell transcription elongation complex  <cit> . perhaps most relevant to its role in enhancing trpc6-mediated currents, the yeast homologue of snf <dig>  vps <dig>  as well as other members of the escrt complexes, have been shown to be involved in the trafficking and surface expression of the sodium pump ena <dig>  <cit> . although we have not been able to detect a change in the amount of total trpc <dig> expressed on the cell surface or in lipid rafts in response to co-expression of snf <dig>  it is possible that snf <dig> traffics the channel to a subdomain of the plasma membrane where trpc <dig> activity is enhanced. along these lines, it is noteworthy that podocin enhances trpc <dig> activity in a cholesterol dependent manner without altering plasma membrane expression  <cit> , while the differential requirement of escrt-ii for the budding of avian sarcoma and leukosis virus  and human immunodeficiency virus, type- <dig> , correlates with their assembly on phosphatidylethanolamine  containing or pe-negative membranes, respectively  <cit> . alternatively, it is possible that snf <dig> regulates trpc <dig> indirectly by competing with a negative regulator or by altering the activity of another membrane protein in the vicinity of trpc <dig>  such as an enzyme that affects phosphoinositide levels. finally, trpc <dig> has been reported to be activated by membrane deformation  <cit> , though this has been disputed  <cit> . one could hypothesize that snf <dig> may act to recruit escrt-ii to trpc <dig>  and alter trpc <dig> function through local convex deformation of the membrane  <cit> . further understanding the mechanism whereby snf <dig> enhances trpc <dig> currents will be the goal of future investigations.

CONCLUSIONS
this work shows that:  <dig>  snf <dig> is a potential binding partner of trpc <dig>   <dig>  overexpression of snf <dig> enhances both wild-type and mutant trpc <dig> current densities, and  <dig>  modulating snf <dig> expression levels affects nfat activation downstream of gain-of-function, fsgs-associated trpc <dig> mutations. the mechanism for regulating channel activity is not mediated by changes in global cell surface expression or recruitment into lipid rafts. taken together, these results identify snf <dig> as a potent modulator of the trpc <dig> channel.
