BACKGROUND
epithelial tight junctions are the most apical component of the junctional complex and are critical for epithelial barrier function as they form the paracellular diffusion barrier  <cit> . tight junctions are composed of several transmembrane proteins that are linked to a cytoplasmic plaque and the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . this cytoplasmic plaque consists of a protein network formed by adaptor proteins with multiple protein/protein interaction motifs, cytoskeletal linkers and signalling proteins such as protein kinases and phosphatases  <cit> . these junction associated protein complexes also interact with dual localisation proteins that localise to both the junction and the nucleus  <cit> . several of these junctional components have been linked to the regulation of epithelial proliferation, differentiation and polarisation  <cit> .

zo- <dig> is the first tight junction protein identified and functions as a junctional adaptor that interacts with multiple transmembrane proteins, components of the junctional plaque and actin filaments  <cit> . zo- <dig> is expressed by most cells and, in the absence of tight junctions, can associate with other cell-cell adhesion complexes, such as adherens and gap junctions  <cit> . repression of zo- <dig> expression in different epithelial cell lines revealed that zo- <dig> is not required for junction formation and polarisation in two-dimensional  culture systems  <cit> . in three-dimensional cultures , however, normal zo- <dig> expression is required for the formation of polarised hollow cysts, indicating that it plays a role in the regulation of epithelial morphogenesis  <cit> .

zo- <dig> has been directly associated with a signalling function of tight junctions. zo- <dig> binds with its sh <dig> domain to the y-box transcription factor zonab , which results in cytoplasmic sequestration and inhibition of the transcriptional activity of the latter protein  <cit> . the zo-1/zonab pathway regulates epithelial proliferation and expression of genes important for epithelial differentiation and cell cycle progression such as erbb- <dig>  cyclin d <dig> and pcna  <cit> . the sh <dig> domain of zo- <dig> also interacts with the heat shock protein apg- <dig>  <cit> . apg- <dig> and zonab compete for binding to zo- <dig>  resulting in zonab dissociation and activation if the interaction with apg- <dig> is favoured by conditions such as, for example, heat shock. expression of all three proteins can be deregulated in different epithelial cancers, suggesting that they might be functionally relevant for the maintenance of the epithelial cell type and tumorigenesis  <cit> .

given the modulatory role of zo- <dig> during junction formation, its involvement in large protein complexes, and the role of heat shock proteins as folding and assembly factors, we tested whether apg- <dig> regulates junction formation. our data indicate that apg- <dig> is not essential for the formation of functional tight junctions but regulates junction assembly in 2-d cultures similar to its interaction partner zo- <dig>  in 3-d cultures, however, apg- <dig> was required for normal epithelial morphogenesis, suggesting that the heat shock protein regulates pathways important for epithelial polarisation and differentiation.

RESULTS
apg- <dig> regulates the assembly of functional tight junctions
apg- <dig> binds to the sh <dig> domain of zo- <dig>  and this domain is important for the regulation of junction assembly in mdck cells  <cit> . to test whether apg- <dig> is also required for junction formation, we made use of previously described mdck cell lines permitting the conditional depletion of either apg- <dig> or zo- <dig>  <cit> . in these cell lines, rna interference is induced by the addition of tetracycline, which inactivates a co-transfected repressor, resulting in expression of shrnas. we made use of four different cell lines: two expressing two different shrna constructs that target different sequences of apg- <dig> , one for the repression of zo- <dig>  <cit> , and a control cell line expressing a non-targeting construct.

to determine possible effects on junction formation, we combined these cell lines with a calcium-switch protocol, permitting us to study synchronised de novo junction formation  <cit> . to do this, cells were plated at high density on permeable supports, which facilitate the functional analysis of tight junctions  <cit> , in medium containing a low calcium concentration, which does not allow the formation of intercellular junctions.  <dig> hours later, junction formation was stimulated by changing the medium to standard culture medium. rna interference was induced by adding tetracycline at the time of plating. figure  <dig> confirms that tetracycline induced depletion of zo- <dig> and apg- <dig> in the respective cell lines, but not in control cells. depletion of apg- <dig> did not significantly affect the expression of zo- <dig> or of the interacting proteins zo- <dig> and zo- <dig> . similarly, no differences in the expression of occludin and claudin- <dig> were observed .

we next monitored the assembly of functional tight junctions by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance  at different times after adding calcium. figure 2a shows that tetracycline did not affect the assembly of tight junctions: with and without the antibiotic, cultures reached maximal ter within about  <dig> hours . ter then decreased again to about 60% of maximal values after  <dig> hours. after  <dig> days, cells reached steady state values of about  <dig> Ωcm <dig>  this is the typical profile of ter development that has previously been described for mdck strain ii cells  <cit> .

tight junctions restrict paracellular permeability of ions as well as of hydrophilic molecules based on their size. as the two parameters are not always regulated in the same way, we measured paracellular permeability of fluorescent dextrans in steady state cultures. cultures were incubated for  <dig> hours with  <dig> kd or  <dig> kd fluorescent dextran and diffusion in the apical-to-basolateral direction was then determined by measuring fluorescence in the basolateral medium. figure 2e shows that neither depletion of zo- <dig> nor apg- <dig> affected paracellular permeability of  <dig> kd dextran. we could also not detect an effect on  <dig> kd dextran diffusion . thus, apg-2- and zo-1-depleted cells assembled junctions that represented functional paracellular diffusion barriers.

depletion of apg- <dig> retards the recruitment of zo- <dig> and interacting proteins
we next tested whether inhibition of ter development reflected a retardation of junction formation that was detectable by immunofluorescence. hence, we fixed cells after different periods of time with calcium and then monitored the distribution of apg- <dig> and junctional markers by immunofluorescence. figure 3a shows that apg- <dig> was present in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm of control cells at all times. as described previously, weak apg- <dig> staining was also observed along the lateral membrane  <cit> . this appeared to be more evident during early time points . however, this does not appear to reflect increased association with zo- <dig>  as we could not detect preferential co-immunoprecipitation during junction formation as opposed to stable monolayers . in depleted cells, expression was low as expected from the immunoblots in figure  <dig> 

we next analysed the distribution of zo- <dig>  in control cells, zo- <dig> was quickly recruited to the forming junctional complex and formed complete junctional rings within  <dig> hour . in contrast, apg- <dig> depletion inhibited junctional recruitment of zo- <dig>  and junctional rings were only complete after  <dig> hours . this inhibition is unlikely to reflect changes in the organisation of the actin cytoskeleton, as we could not detect obvious differences in the formation of cortical actin belts between control and apg- <dig> depleted cells . however, it cannot be excluded that reduced apg- <dig> expression caused more subtle changes in actin organisation. thus, apg- <dig> regulates the junctional recruitment of zo- <dig> without strongly affecting the actin cytoskeleton.

we next determined effects on the recruitment of occludin and claudin- <dig>  two transmembrane components of tight junctions  <cit> . figure 5a shows that occludin concentrated more slowly at the forming junctional complex in apg- <dig> depleted cells. similarly, zo- <dig> and zo- <dig> were also recruited more slowly . claudin- <dig>  however, was more broadly distributed over the plasma membrane at early time points and there were no significant differences between control and depleted cell . cingulin, a protein known to interact with zo- <dig>  <cit> , was also recruited more slowly to the forming junctions  whereas gef-h <dig>  which interacts with cingulin  <cit> , was recruited only later to tight junctions even in control cells, and no differences were observed in apg- <dig> depleted cells .

zo- <dig> depletion has also been associated with a retardation in the maturation of adherens junctions from spot-like to belt-like junctions  <cit> . hence, we tested whether apg-2-depletion influenced the junctional recruitment of the adherens junction markers α-catenin, which is known to interact with zo- <dig>  <cit> , and e-cadherin. indeed, α-catenin was recruited more slowly and e-cadherin required more time to form belt-like junctions . thus, apg- <dig> depletion retards tight junction formation as well as maturation of adherens junctions.

at later time points, the junctional distribution of tight and adherens junction markers was the same in apg- <dig> depleted and non depleted cells. we could also not detect any differences in the triton x- <dig> insolubility of different junctional proteins . together with the functional data in figure  <dig>  this suggests that apg- <dig> is not required for junction formation but functions as a regulator.

apg- <dig> is required for epithelial morphogenesis in 3-d cultures
apg- <dig> regulates signalling by zo- <dig> and zonab, and both proteins have been associated with the regulation of epithelial morphogenesis of mdck cells cultured in extracellular matrix gels  <cit> . hence, we next tested whether apg- <dig> depletion affected the capability of mdck cells to form polarised hollow cysts in 3-d cultures.

control cells and apg- <dig> rnai cell lines were cultured without or with tetracycline for  <dig> days and were then analyzed by phase contrast microscopy  and immunofluorescence . tetracycline did not affect the capability of control cells to form polarised cysts as previously reported  <cit> . apg- <dig> depleted cells, however, did not form regular structures and most of the cysts did not contain an obvious lumen. this was confirmed by counting the number of cysts formed by the different cultures: more than 70% of cysts formed by control cells or by apg- <dig> rnai cell lines in the absence of tetracycline formed cysts with a single lumen, but less than 10% did so when apg- <dig> was depleted .

fluorescence microscopy revealed cysts formed by apg- <dig> depleted cells did not achieve the normal polarised organisation. whereas control cells formed a strong actin ring along the internal lumen, marking the apical pole of the cells; apg- <dig> depleted cells had the strongest actin labelling along the external surface of cysts or in irregular internal structures . similarly, the golgi apparatus was situated between the nuclei and the lumen in the control cells; in apg- <dig> depleted cells, however, the golgi apparatus was often detected between the nuclei and the external surface of the cysts . immunofluorescence experiments further showed that neither the apical marker podocalyxin nor not the basolateral plasma membrane protein erbb- <dig> achieved their normal polarised expression in apg- <dig> as well as zo- <dig> depleted cells . staining for junctional markers such as occludin, zo- <dig> and β-catenin also suggested that cells with reduced expression of apg- <dig> or zo- <dig> failed to form well-organised polarised cysts . thus, apg- <dig> is required for the formation of polarised hollow epithelial cysts in 3-d cultures.

discussion
tight junctions are composed of multimeric protein complexes often formed by different types of proteins that interact with each other. epithelial junction formation is a sequential process that starts with the formation of a primordial adhesive junction that then matures into distinct tight and adherens junctions. zo- <dig> can interact with different components of tight and adherens junctions and appears to play a modulatory role during formation of both types of junctions  <cit> . zo- <dig> also regulates gene expression, cell proliferation and epithelial morphogenesis  <cit> . zo-1's role in gene expression is regulated by an interaction with the heat shock protein apg- <dig>  <cit> . here we show that apg- <dig> also modulates junction formation and is required for normal epithelial morphogenesis in 3-d cultures.

depletion of apg- <dig> affects junction formation in a similar way as depletion of zo-1: formation of functional junctions was retarded, but not prevented, and the inhibition was only modest. in the case of zo- <dig>  it seems that its function in tight junction formation is at least in part redundant as depletion of zo- <dig> in zo- <dig> knockout cells prevents tight junction formation  <cit> . whether mdck cells express other proteins with a similar function as apg- <dig> is currently not known; however, it is conceivable that other heat shock proteins might also aid junction formation. alternatively, it could be that apg- <dig> functions as a catalyst; hence, its function is not required, but its presence accelerates junction formation.

the mechanism by which apg- <dig> regulates junction assembly is not known. it could be that apg- <dig> regulates formation of zo- <dig> complexes. we have thus far not been able, however, to detect differences in proteins co-precipitating with zo- <dig> if apg- <dig> was depleted . nevertheless, it is possible that this involves interactions that are not detergent resistant or other unknown proteins. we could also not detect clear differences in the triton x- <dig> insolubility of junctional proteins between control and apg- <dig> depleted cells, but there was only a small pool of insoluble proteins at early time points when junction formation was inhibited . as we have only observed kinetic differences in junction formation, minor quantitative changes in complex formation might be involved that would be difficult to assess experimentally.

the sh <dig> domain of zo- <dig>  which is the domain that interacts with apg- <dig>  is not only required but also sufficient to rescue junction formation in zo- <dig> depleted mdck cells  <cit> . however, the sh <dig> domain by itself remains in the cytosol and is not recruited to cell junctions  <cit> , suggesting that it binds to a cellular factor that does not need to be recruited to junctions. one such factor is the transcription factor zonab; however, neither overexpression nor depletion of zonab affects tight junction formation   <cit> . hence, one possibility is that zo- <dig> regulates a function of apg- <dig> rather than the other way around. in fact, zo- <dig> does not bind the peptide-binding domain of apg- <dig> but to the n-terminal domain containing the atpase. hence, zo- <dig> binding might affect yet to be discovered functional properties of apg- <dig> such as, for example, release of another protein bound to the peptide-binding domain. it will therefore be important to analyse how zo- <dig> binding affects the biochemical properties of apg- <dig> and to search for apg- <dig> substrates and other interacting proteins.

apg- <dig> also regulates epithelial morphogenesis in 3-d cultures. apg- <dig> depleted cells did not form hollow cysts but poorly organised structures with none or several small lumen. the disorganised nature of these structures was evident from different immunofluorescence labellings that showed that their cells did not possess a uniform polarity or, in the absence of a clear lumen, maintained apical markers at the outer surface of the cysts. strikingly, we observed the same phenotype in cells depleted of zo- <dig>  as overexpression of zonab also caused a similar phenotype, we considered it as likely that the reduced expression of zo- <dig> affected morphogenesis by stimulating zonab  <cit> . apg- <dig> depletion, however, does not stimulate zonab but inhibits it, as the two proteins compete with each other for binding to the sh <dig> domain of zo- <dig>  <cit> . however, it is possible that deregulation, and not just activation, of the zo-1/zonab pathway causes defects in the development of polarised hollow cysts. alternatively, zo- <dig> might regulate a function of apg- <dig> that is important for morphogenesis. moreover, apg- <dig> is expressed in different subcellular locations and, like other heat shock proteins, might bind many different proteins and, hence, regulate different types of processes. nevertheless, the similarity of the phenotypes in junction formation and 3-d morphogenesis caused by depletion of apg- <dig> and zo- <dig> suggests that the two interacting proteins function in at least overlapping pathways during epithelial differentiation.

CONCLUSIONS
depletion of apg- <dig> in mdck cells retards junction assembly and inhibits epithelial morphogenesis in three-dimensional cultures, indicating that apg- <dig> is a functionally relevant regulator of epithelial differentiation.
