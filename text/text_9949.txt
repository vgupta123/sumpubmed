BACKGROUND
the eukaryotic parasite entamoeba histolytica, the causative agent of amebiasis, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, as well as a category b priority biodefense pathogen  <cit> . in dhaka, bangladesh, surveys done in a cohort of children living in an urban slum showed evidence of e. histolytica infection  in 80% of the children tested  <cit> . host genetics can influence susceptibility to infectious disease and a single amino acid substitution in the host cytokine receptor homology domain  <dig> of lepr and a difference in the leukocyte antigen class ii allele expressed are associated with increased susceptibility to intestinal infection by the e. histolytica  <cit> . symptomatic disease occurs in only a minority of e. histolytica infections  in an unpredictable manner and an initially asymptomatic infection can over time convert to invasive disease , amebic liver abscess can occur years after travel to an endemic area  <cit> . it is hypothesized that both host and parasite factors contribute to the outcome of an e. histolytica <cit> . however, although progress has been made in both the identification and characterization of parasite virulence factors and in understanding the regulation of their gene expression, direct manipulation of the e. histolytica genome remains elusive, and the traits affecting parasite virulence have not been genetically mapped  <cit> .

despite this variations that occur within repeat-containing genes in the amoeba genome chitinase and serine-rich e. histolytica protein srehp have been used to examine the link between e. histolytica genetics and disease  <cit> . the high rates of polymorphism however at the loci make it difficult to use them for this purpose and an association between some of these markers and virulence has not been proven in large scale studies  <cit> . however, based on the composition of highly repetitive trna arrays, e. histolytica has been shown to have distinct genotypes with different potentials to cause disease  <cit> .

e. histolytica trna genes are unusually organized in  <dig> arrays containing up to  <dig> trna genes in each array, with intergenic regions between trna genes containing short tandem repeats   <cit> . a 6-locus  trna gene-linked genotyping system has shown that the number of strs at these loci differ in parasite populations isolated from three clinical groups   <cit> . the variations occurring in trna genotypes, even between the ameba strains isolated from the intestine and in the liver abscess of the same patient, suggest that not all strains of e. histolytica have the same capacity to reach the liver of the infected host  <cit> . however, the diversity of trna linked str genotypes occurring even in a restricted geographic region, and the frequent occurrence of novel genotypes, limit their usefulness to predict infection outcome or to probe the population structure of e. histolytica  <cit> . the extensive genetic polymorphism in the repeat sequences of srehp, chitinase and trna arrays for instance could reflect slippage occurring during e. histolytica dna replication as tibayrenc et al. hypothesize that the parasites exist as clonal populations that are stable over large geographical areas and long periods of time  <cit> .

compared with other dna markers, single nucleotide polymorphisms  are genetically stable, amenable to future automated methods of detection, and in contrast to the highly repetitive trna arrays, their location can be mapped in the e. histolytica genome  <cit> . after the first sequencing and assembly of entamoeba histolytica hm-1:imss genome was published by loftus et al. bhattacharya et al. amplified and sequenced 9 kb of coding and non-coding dna to evaluate the variability of e. histolytica snps in  <dig> strains and identified a link between some genotypes and clinical outcome  <cit> . the advent of the next generation of high throughput genomic sequencing  technologies has provided more comprehensive opportunities to investigate variation in the genome of e. histolytica and clinical outcome by allowing the fast and efficient way to sequence laboratory-cultured ameba of clinical relevance  <cit> . these cultured strains were isolated from different geographical areas endemic for amebiasis and contained large numbers of “strain-specific” snps in addition to snps present in more than one strain  <cit> . the sequence variations associated with virulence strains previously identified in the sequenced 9 kb dna , and snps in the non-coding dna either between xm_ <dig>  and xm_ <dig>  sequences  or 5’ of the amoebapore c transcript xm_ <dig>   seemed to be present only the two to four bangladesh isolates sequenced by bhattacharya et al. and were not present in the available international sequenced whole genomes  <cit> .

the goal of this work was to develop a set of less variable markers to profile a large number of strains from different regions of the globe, therefore we selected additional non-synonomous snps which bhattacharya et al. had shown to be less variable, to probe the population structure of e. histolytica in depth  <cit> . the new snps were present with a frequency of  <dig> - <dig>  in the pool of geographically disparate e. histolytica parasites whose genomes had been sequenced. we restricted our snp candidates for initial analysis to genes with the potential to be involved in the virulence of this parasite  <cit> . as our current hypothesis is that the development of disease is multifactorial, or polygenic, and involves a combination of parasite factors in the current work we selected several loci to test for their association with disease outcome in e. histolytica. these loci contained snps that resulted in non-synonomous changes to the encoded amino acids, were present in more than three of the sequenced e. histolytica genomes, and enriched either in strains originating from symptomatic or asymptomatic infections. we have shown that two of these snps were significantly associated with disease severity in bangladesh isolates.

RESULTS
initial identification and validation of single nucleotide polymorphisms identified using next generation sequencing
the genome sequencing projects of multiple e. histolytica strains performed at the j. craig venter institute  and at the institute of integrative biology  provided the sequence data used for the identification of snps   <cit> . a total of  <dig>  snps within coding dna were identified in the sequenced genomes . each strain had approximately  <dig>  homozygous and  <dig>  heterozygous snps. half of all the snps identified were unique and present in only one strain . like ghosh et al. we identified mainly dimorphic snps, while potential tri- and tetrazygote variants were very infrequent  <cit> . this, however, may reflect a bias in snp detection programs because mukherjee et al. observed considerable heterogeneity in the ploidy of e. histolytica  <cit> .

to validate the use of snps from next generation sequencing data, a set of  <dig> snps predicted by ngs were verified by conventional sanger sequencing of pcr amplicons from three selected strains, ms96- <dig> , ds4- <dig>   and the reference sequence hm-1:imss . primers were designed to amplify the region containing each snp. the primers used are detailed in additional file 1: table s <dig> and the amplicons are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> . pcr was performed with these primers on ms96- <dig>  ds4- <dig>  and hm-1:imss genomic dna as described in materials and methods. the amplified products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and dna fragments of the correct size were gel purified and sequenced by sanger sequencing. in all cases the results of the sanger sequencing of the ms96- <dig> and ds4- <dig> amplicons matched the sequence produced by the ngs . the sanger data from hm-1:imss also matched the reference genome however a snp in the alcohol dehydrogenase gene  was heterozygous in this hm-1: imss reference strain, which was not previously known . we therefore concluded that e. histolytica single nucleotide polymorphisms studied here were accurately identified.

candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms
the resampling results described above indicated that snps were maintained within an e. histolytica strain under continuous culture. however, this does not exclude the possibility that a particular genotype may change in frequency within an endemic population. to test for association between snps and disease outcome, e. histolytica samples were collected from an area endemic for amebiasis . both field samples and xenic cultures established from asymptomatic and symptomatic infections were used as a source of dna ;  <dig> e. histolytica positive samples from diarrheal stool; and  <dig> e. histolytica positive samples collected during monthly stool sample surveillance). we anticipated that the virulence of this parasite in humans may not be the direct target of selection, because invasive disease does not seem to confer an advantage to pathogen dissemination  <cit> . to focus on potentially genetically stable snps, which were nevertheless variably present in the different stains, we selected non-synonomous snps in the available data that were present in at least four, but not more than nine genomes. this allowed us to select for polymorphic snps that frequently occur in ameba and may represent genetically stable or ancestral variants that remain at a frequency of  <dig>  to  <dig>  a frequency that gave us sufficient statistical power to detect 2x differences within the amebic population surveyed in this study. for a snp to be considered a candidate for association with symptomatic disease it had to occur at a greater frequency in the isolates from symptomatic amebic infections. twenty-one potentially informative loci were chosen for further analysis in a larger number of e. histolytica isolates as described in the methods section of this paper .

snp genotyping of e. histolytica clinical isolates
the  <dig> marker loci selected from whole genome sequencing data were used to genotype clinical isolates of e. histolytica. dna isolated from three sources, stool samples, short term xenic cultures of parasites from stool and amebic liver abscess aspirates, was used as a template to amplify the  <dig> loci. pcr products were sequenced using illumina sequencing technology and the resulting demuliplexed sequence reads aligned to reference sequences representing the genes to which each amplicon corresponds in order to determine the nucleotide present in the sampled genomes .

five of the  <dig> targets were not consistently co-amplified in our pcr reactions. this could have been due to differences in primer efficiency or off-target amplification in the xenic culture and stool specimens that contain an undefined mixture of intestinal microflora or it may also be because the gene is missing from some isolates or highly divergent. these five loci were not included in later analyses that only used the  <dig> remaining loci. we selected only those samples where all target sequences were efficiently amplified and we observed good coverage of all the expected amplicon sequences. if one or more of the targets was missing, then the sample was eliminated . the final data set consisted of  <dig> or the original  <dig> samples  which passed quality control and had the greater than  <dig> fold sequence coverage needed to confidently call snps.

the libraries generated from stool samples and from polyxenic culture contained a greater number of reads that did not map to the e. histolytica amplicons than those obtained from amebic liver abscess aspirates. this was likely due in part to off-target amplification  of gut flora, or a reduction in specificity because most of these samples did not undergo nested pcr amplification prior to library preparation. samples isolated from amebic liver aspirates do not have associated bacterial flora, unlike pyloric abscesses, therefore a higher proportion of the template dna is e. histolytica.

in the samples that passed quality control, the read depth for individual snps was >8x coverage; this was considered adequate for snp verification. snps were scored as described in materials and methods. the results of the illumina sequencing and the presence of predicted and novel snps within the amplicon sequences was tabulated as homozygous reference  heterozygous  or homozygous non-reference  . in figure  <dig> the diversity of the snps at each locus in both the original sequence data , and in the bangladesh samples analyzed in this study, .

our work supports previous finding of extensive diversity among e. histolytica isolates from the same geographic origin, in phylogenetic trees only four of the  <dig> samples could be grouped into two sets of two with greater than 50% confidence suggesting that the genotypes of individual parasites do not contain consistent phylogenetic signals . such a result suggests that the markers do not share the same genealogy, likely due to extensive recombination or re-assortment breaking down linkage between markers. the diversity of e. histolytica genome raises a concern in regard to later analysis as it raises the possibility that a rapid rate of evolution may drive any observed differences between e. histolytica genotypes in samples isolated in regions separated even by relatively small geographical distances.

the effect of adaptation of to in vitro culture on snp allele frequencies
to examine the potential effect of adaption to in vitro culture on the frequency of snp alleles, and therefore how well transiently or long established cultured trophozoites represent the parasite population, snp allele frequencies were compared between parasites genotyped directly from stool samples and those from cultured trophozoites .

in cultures originating from asymptomatic isolates five linked non-reference snps at the lcat ehi_065250/xm_ <dig>  locus were detected in 80% of the strains, these same snps occurred in only 16% of the e. histolytica positive stool samples from asymptomatic hosts . this suggests that during establishment of e. histolytica cultures a strong selection pressure was exerted on sequence in linkage with the lcat ehi_ <dig> gene. this could either cause growth failure of the strains with the reference allele or the outgrowth of a minority genotype in mixed infections .

to confirm that this change in the distribution of the non-reference snps was due to culture conditions, and not due to the bangladesh origin of these samples, the comparison was repeated using only the strains isolated and transiently established in culture at icddr, b and genotyped using mlst during this study. a similar trend was observed.

ehi_ <dig>  belongs to a gene family that consists of ten genes; they range in identity from 82% to 51% ; two are highly similar to ehi_ <dig> . the primers used in snp amplification were specific for ehi_ <dig> and did not amplify the other members of this gene family. the other lcat gene sequences are sufficiently different that off-target amplification would be detected in the sequence alignments of the illumina reads. such off-target amplification was never observed, confirming that amplification was specific for the target ehi_ <dig> locus.

the effect on snp genotype was only apparent for the lcat ehi_ <dig> snps and the p value of the ehi_ <dig> snps was not sufficiently low to eliminate the possibility of false discovery . therefore the cultured strains were included in table  <dig> and the statistical association of snps with disease phenotype was determined using the complete dataset but confirmed using the data set with only clinical samples .

genetic differences between virulent and avirulent e. histolytica strains
the ehi_080100/xm_ <dig>  cylicin- <dig> locus contained two closely linked snps 1& <dig>  these snps were significantly associated phenotype . both the reference and the non-reference variants at this locus were present in asymptomatic samples however the non-reference variants were more frequent in liver abscess samples and less frequent in samples isolated from patients with diarrhea/dysentery .

amebic liver abscess is a complication only found in adults whereas dysentery is more frequent in children. the liver aspirate samples in this study were collected from adults, at rajshahi medical college hospital, bangladesh. this is a geographically distinct location from the dysenteric and asymptomatic samples that were collected from children in dhaka, bangladesh. one goal of this study was to identify snps to type the virulence potential of the parasite in amebic liver aspirates; if snps occur at different frequencies in dhaka and rajshahi isolates they will appear as potential biomarkers of parasites with the potential to initiate amebic liver abscesses. the difference in snp 1& <dig> frequency in both asymptomatic and diarrheal samples was replicated however in the sequenced genomes from diverse populations in asia and south america   <cit> .

the previously discussed locus, lcat ehi_ <dig>  which contained five different snps , was also associated with symptomatic disease however possible selection in culture rendered the distribution less significant within the larger data set .

the changes at both the lcat ehi_ <dig> and the cylicin- <dig> ehi_ <dig> loci altered a potential phosphorylation site in the encoded protein sequence , and are located at the c-terminal portion of the proteins . expression of ehi_ <dig> has been shown to be modulated in the mouse model of amebiasis, and to be under the control of the ure3-bp transcription factor  <cit> . ehi_ <dig> appears to be a novel member of the e. histolytica “promoter family” potential membrane proteins regulated by the transcription factor ure3-bp with highly similar promoters, and amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences   <cit> . ehi_ <dig> encodes a hydrophilic glutamic acid/lysine rich protein with an n-terminal signal p and although annotated as cylicin- <dig>  it is not an ortholog of the human gene  <cit> . its function remains unknown.

discussion
e. histolytica snps were identified in amebic dna isolated from a bangladesh population by amplicon sequencing. non-reference snps in the ehi_ <dig> cylicin- <dig> gene were significantly associated with the virulence phenotype .

we initially analyzed the genetic diversity among  <dig> sequenced e. histolytica genomes that represented different geographical origins and disease manifestations, and selected a set of  <dig> polymorphic sites in coding regions where snps change the encoded amino acid. the distribution of these  <dig> non-synonymous snps in field isolates and cultured strains of e. histolytica were examined in samples collected from an endemic area in bangladesh by multilocus sequence typing . of  <dig> loci that passed quality control five were invariantor very infrequent in bangladesh.

our results are inconsistent with a model of clonality in e. histolytica populations. in a clonal population we would expect to see strong linkage disequilibrium between markers, since linkage would not be eroded by recombination and sexual reassortment. in fact, we saw only two identical genotypes in our sample, suggesting a considerable amount of recombination and/or reassortment. our results support previous observations, based on short tandem repeat dna sequences, of high diversity among genotypes even within limited geographical areas  <cit> . due to this complexity, the number of whole genomes sequenced in the pilot studies, were not sufficient to predict accurately the snps associated with disease. however,  <dig> out of the  <dig> loci examined,, were significantly associated with disease in isolates collected in rajshahi and dhaka, bangladesh.

one caveat to this study was that the amebic liver abscess samples were collected in rajshahi but the stools samples were collected at a different location ; the differences in the grouping of liver abscess and stool e. histolytica could reflect geographical differentiation  <cit> . ali et al. have however previously described different genotypes in liver abscess and enteric samples from the same patients  <cit> . this suggests a possible genetic selection for parasites with invasive capabilities. based on our data we suggest a divergent rather than sequential model of the potential to cause severe disease  <cit> . non-reference ehi_ <dig> snps were more frequent in asymptomatic than diarrhea/dysentery samples. however the non-reference snp potentially predisposed the asymptomatic infection to initiate an amebic liver abscess rather than amebic colitis  as the non-reference ehi_ <dig> snps, were present with even higher prevalence, in samples from amebic liver abscess . additional studies are needed to identify additional amebic biomarkers associated with invasive disease.

in both ehi_ <dig> and ehi_ <dig> the consequence of the non-reference polymorphisms was to change two amino acids within the c-terminal domains. the reason behind the association of these snps with invasive disease is not yet clear. the polymorphic genes have not previously been associated with a virulent phenotype, and other than the previously discussed change in at a potential phosphorylation site, there were no other predicted changes in protein function using the currently available bioinformatics tools   <cit> .

ehi_ <dig>  is present on a short region of contiguous dna in the e. histolytica hm-1:imss genome assembly that could not be assembled into a larger contiguous dna segment or sequence scaffold . this suggests that the gene may be present in proximity to highly repetitive regions that prevent unambiguous assembly. lorenzi et al. suggest that repeats and repeat-clusters are found at syntenic break points between e. histolytica and e. dispar and could act as recombination hot spots promoting genome rearrangement  <cit> . this “informative” locus could therefore reside in regions of dna prone to allelic imbalance. in addition, no e. dispar homologue has been found for ehi_ <dig>  making this gene an interesting candidate for further studies.

genomic location of the snps in the ehi_ <dig> and ehi_ <dig> genes.

the currently identified snps could act as genetic “markers” in incomplete linkage disequilibrium with neighboring dna that contains causative or regulatory snp  mutations that result in a modulation of gene expression. it is interesting to note that contiguous with the ehi_ <dig> gene is one of the genes encoding the intermediate subunit of the galactose- and n-acetyl-d-galactosamine  inhibitable lectin   <cit> . the gal/galnac inhibitable lectinis a well-characterised virulence factor in e. histolytica <cit> .

it is also possible that amino acids changes resulting from the snps directly influence the biological activity of the encoded protein and that these changes affect the ability of the trophozoite to invade its host. what has never been clear is the advantage to the e. histolytica parasite to the causation of invasive disease  <cit> . it is conceivable that these snps result in a maladaptation of the coevolving genomes of parasite and host and are the reason for the expression of the virulent e. histolytica phenotype  <cit> . the effect of the changes described in this study on the stability and function of the encoded protein is currently under investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
e. histolytica does not follow the model of t. gondii that exists predominantly in a few main lineages  <cit> . rather, even in population from a single geographic location, majority of the individual parasites show unique genotypes. the number of trna-linked genotypes discovered, are likely to continue increasing in number and will enable the measurement of strain diversity. however, the results presented in this work support the hypothesis that a relationship exists between the genotype of an e. histolytica strain and parasite virulence. unlike the trna-linked sequence types  which are merely surrogate markers for the prediction of infection outcomes, non-synonymous snps detected in the present study shows promise to identify parasite factors directly linked to infection outcomes  <cit> . although preliminary, our findings identified two candidate genes that may contribute to the pathogenesis of these parasites. the level of genetic variation we observed increases the importance of the snps we have linked to disease. we are currently investigating the impact of the non-synonomous changes on the function of these proteins.

to fully understand the genetics of this parasite, additional biomarkers will be needed to understand virulence and different outcomes of the disease at the genome level. in the absence of stable clonal populations deeper characterization of the variation in the e. histolytica genome requires sequences from additional ameba strains. using the protocol described in this paper usable sequence data was gathered from approximately half of the field samples. this allowed the testing of the association of selected candidate snps within an endemic population. given the large amount of variation that occurs, snps need to be carefully chosen to type the virulence potential in an e. histolytica mlst schema rather than to reflect parasite phylogeny. future studies are needed which focus on the genome of the infecting parasite in conjunction with the genome of the infected host.
