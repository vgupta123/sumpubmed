BACKGROUND
the gaseous plant hormone ethylene is reported to play an active role in a wide range of developmental processes, including germination, flower and leaf senescence, fruit ripening, leaf abscission, root nodulation, programmed cell death, and responses to abiotic stresses and pathogen attacks  <cit> . components of ethylene signalling have been extensively studied mainly in arabidopsis model plant  <cit>  revealing a linear transduction pathway that leads to the activation of transcriptional regulators belonging to the ethylene response factor  type. these last components of the ethylene signalling pathway are responsible for modulating the transcription of ethylene-regulated genes. whereas the apparent simplicity of the ethylene transduction pathway cannot account for the wide diversity of plant responses to ethylene, the molecular mechanisms that enable this hormone to drive different physiological and developmental processes in an appropriate way are yet to be elucidated. being encoded by one of the largest family of plant transcription factors, erf proteins are the most suited step of ethylene signalling where the diversity and specificity of ethylene responses may originate.

erfs are trans-acting factors unique to plants shown to bind specifically to gcc box cis-acting elements found in the promoter regions of ethylene-responsive genes  <cit> . the erf family is part of the ap2-containing domain superfamily which also contains the ap <dig> and rav families of transcription factors  <cit> . the ap <dig> family is characterized by the presence of two copies of the ap <dig> domain initially described in the arabidopsis homeotic gene apetala <dig> <cit> . the rav family contains two dna binding domains, an ap2-like domain that binds the caaca motif and a b3-like domain that binds the cacctg motif  <cit> . the erf type family is further divided into two major subfamilies, the erf and the cbf/dreb  subfamilies of transcription factors  <cit>  both containing a single ap <dig> domain. dreb subfamily is characterized by the presence of a valine and glutamic acid respectively at position  <dig> and  <dig> in the ap <dig> domain, whereas alanine and aspartic acid are conserved in the corresponding positions for erfs  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that the amino acid residues involved in dna binding are not conserved between ap <dig> and erfs  <cit> . erf type proteins have been first isolated in the context of plant responses to biotic stress while dreb are associated with abiotic stress. erfs have been shown to bind the gcc-box found in ethylene-responsive genes and drebs to the dre cis-regulatory element. in arabidopsis, erfs account for up to 53 % of the total erf/dreb proteins  <cit> . in poplar and rice erf proteins represent 54 % of the erf/dreb family  <cit>  whereas it represents 51 % in soybean  <cit> . comparative structural analysis of arabidopsis and rice erfs, have been performed in silico using either the entire protein sequence for phylogenetic analysis  <cit> , or the conserved ap <dig> domain  <cit>  to infer relationship between erf family members. in arabidopsis the erf subfamily contains  <dig> members and is divided into  <dig> subclasses based on the conservation of the ap <dig> domain  <cit> . the erf domain, first identified as a conserved motif of  <dig> amino acids in four dna-binding proteins from nicotiana tabacum <cit>  is characterized by  <dig> β-sheets and  <dig> α-helix and allows binding of the erfs to the gcc-box  <cit> . in addition to the requirement for a perfectly conserved gcc motif, it has been suggested that the binding affinity may also depend on the nucleotide environment of the gcc box as well as on the nature of some amino acid residues within the erf binding domain  <cit> . moreover, in line with the data reporting that pti <dig>  an erf type transcription factor, is able to bind promoters lacking a gcc box cis-element  <cit> , recent studies demonstrated that erfs can also bind different cis-elements such as vwre   <cit> .

erfs are ubiquitous in plant kingdom and their functional implications have been studied in various plant species and in a wide range of processes including hormonal signal transduction  <cit> , response to biotic  <cit>  and abiotic stresses  <cit> , regulation of metabolic pathways  <cit>  and developmental processes  <cit> . expression studies indicated that some erfs are regulated by abiotic stresses such as wounding and salt stress  <cit>  and more recently, it was demonstrated that erfs are also involved in seed germination  <cit> . a number of studies demonstrated that in addition to regulating the expression of ethylene-responsive genes harbouring the gcc-box, erfs can also regulate jasmonic acid and salicylic acid-responsive genes  <cit> . the presence of distinctive structural features among erf classes suggests that different members of this family may display different functionalities and binding activities. the differential binding activities of erfs might represent the mean by which ethylene signalling targets a specific set of genes thus providing the basis of the observed tissue and developmental specificity of plant responses to the hormone. however, structural characterization of erf proteins has been restricted to in silico analysis and so far the structure/function relationship has been only superficially addressed  <cit> .

the present study shows that the erf gene family in the tomato is organised into  <dig> subclasses defined by distinct structural features. based on functional analysis of  <dig> tomato erfs and through testing their ability to activate or repress transcriptional activity of target genes, the data suggest that functional activity is conserved among erf proteins sharing the same structural features. moreover, data demonstrate that flanking regions of the core gcc-box sequence are part of the discrimination mechanism by which erfs selectively bind to their target promoters. the data also show that erf genes display tissue-specific patterns of transcript accumulation and uncover their regulation by auxin.

RESULTS
isolation and phylogenetic analysis of tomato erfs
tomato erf cdna clones were initially identified by tblastn search  <cit>  in the tomato unigene database  using a consensus sequence within the ap2/erf domain as a query sequence. forty nine unigenes were found from which ap <dig>  rav and dreb sequences were discarded based on their distinctive features regarding the number of ap <dig> domains, the presence of a b3-like domain and the presence of conserved amino acid residues, respectively. using race-pcr extension approach, complete cdss were obtained for  <dig> erf unigenes that are representative of the main erf sub-groups. subsequently, building on the annotated whole tomato genome sequence recently released  <cit> , a genome wide in silico screening allowed the identification of up to  <dig> genes encoding putative ap2-containing proteins distributed into  <dig> erfs,  <dig> drebs,  <dig> ap <dig> and  <dig> ravs . since arabidopsis erfs have been classified so far using the ap2/erf domain exclusively  <cit> , we constructed the erf phylogenetic trees using either the whole protein sequences or only the ap2/erf domain. due to the weak homology among erf proteins outside the ap2/erf domain, identical classification patterns were obtained with the two clustering methods . however, while  <dig> subclasses  define the erf family in arabidopsis, only nine are represented in tomato, which lacks subclass i . the distribution of the tomato erf proteins into nine individual subclasses is further supported by the presence within the ap <dig> domain of distinctive motifs and amino acid signatures specific for each subclass previously described in arabidopsis <cit>  . in the absence of a consensual nomenclature and due to a lack of rational naming of erf genes across plant species, we attempted to rename the tomato genes by giving a letter  to discriminate between different subclasses and a number to distinguish between members within the same subclass . while complying with the most complete classification available in arabidopsis  <cit>  the proposed nomenclature better clarifies the correspondence between erf subclasses in different species. the correspondence between the classification adopted here and those previously proposed for tomato erfs  <cit>  and for arabidopsis erfs  <cit>  is given in table  <dig>  in this newly proposed classification class xi, defined by sharma et al.  <dig>  splits into two subclasses i and j as proposed by nakano   <cit>  clearly demonstrating that arabidopsis subclass i has no representatives in the tomato. of particular note, members of subclass i harbour imperfect ap <dig> domain and comparatively to other subclasses is under-represented in arabidopsis while it is missing in the tomato. like in arabidopsis, the overwhelming majority of tomato erf genes  are intronless . however, while arabidopsis erfs can bear at most a single intron, among the  <dig> tomato intronic genes,  <dig> have two introns. erf intronic genes are found in four subclasses in arabidopsis while they are spread across  <dig> subclasses in the tomato . although tomato erf genes could be localized on  <dig> chromosomes, they present an uneven distribution with chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> bearing  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively . fine mapping of erfs on the tomato genome revealed that these genes could be distributed individually or in clusters. in particular, chromosome <dig> contains a cluster of  <dig> erf genes  that likely result from tandem duplication events  as suggested by their position within sub-group b in the neighbourhood phylogenetic tree . the correspondence between the nomenclature proposed here for tomato sl-erfs and that issued by the itag  <dig>  nomenclature  is provided in additional file  <dig>

subcellular localization of tomato erfs
all erf proteins display at least one canonical nuclear localization signal with the exception of erf.b. <dig>  d. <dig> and h. <dig> that lack any predictable nuclear targeting motif . since nuclear import of transcription factors is instrumental to their transcriptional activity, we investigated the subcellular localization of these three tomato erfs by generating n-terminal fusions with the yfp expressed under the 35s promoter . transient expression in tobacco by- <dig> protoplasts coupled to confocal microscopy analysis clearly indicated that erf b. <dig>  d. <dig> and h. <dig> are exclusively targeted to the nuclear compartment similar to erf.e. <dig> which contains a consensus nuclear localization signal .


relationship between structural features and functional activity of erfs
to address whether specific structural features affect the ability of erfs from different subclasses to drive the transcriptional activity of target promoters, a transient expression assay in a single cell system was used. tobacco by- <dig> protoplasts were co-transformed with effectors constructs carrying the erf coding sequences driven by the 35s constitutive promoter and reporter constructs consisting of the gfp coding sequence driven either by a gcc-rich synthetic promoter or a native ethylene-responsive promoter. to discriminate between the situation where the absence of activity is due to the lack of binding to the target promoter from those where the erf binds but remains neutral on the promoter activity, we used chimerical constructs as effectors consisting of erf coding sequences fused to the srdx repressor motif  <cit> . since the dominant repression activity of the chimerical construct is mediated by epigenetics mechanisms  <cit> , the absence of repression with any of the erf-srdx constructs can be interpreted as resulting from the incapacity of the erf to recognise the target promoter. figure 3a shows that erf proteins can not only act as activators or repressors, but can also be neutral on the ethylene-responsive promoters. experiments carried out with the srdx fusion demonstrate that all erfs have the ability to bind the gcc box containing promoter except erf.a. <dig> and erf.e. <dig>  members of subclass c display the strongest activation activity whereas erfs from subclass f show the highest repression activity . erfs from subclass a, b and e are weak activators on the gcc box whereas those from class g and h are neutral .


to test whether the regulation of the ethylene-responsive promoters by erf proteins is strictly dependent on the presence of a canonical gcc motif, tomato osmotin and e <dig> native promoters containing or lacking a conserved gcc motif, respectively, were fused to the gfp coding sequence and used as reporter constructs. the data obtained with the fused srdx repressor motif suggest that up to  <dig> erfs out of the  <dig> tested in this study  are capable of binding the osmotin promoter . in line with the results obtained with the synthetic gcc promoter, the osmotin promoter is strongly activated by erfs from subclass c and repressed by erfs from subclass f. by contrast, the transcriptional regulation of the native osmotin promoter by several erfs from other subclasses did not match their behaviour with the synthetic promoters. notably, the native osmotin promoter contains a number of cis-elements that are likely to drive the transcriptional activity in a more complex way than that displayed by the synthetic promoter containing simply the gcc-box. overall, erfs showing the strongest effect on the synthetic gcc promoter also display the most significant effect on the osmotin complex promoter. e <dig> promoter is a well described ethylene-inducible promoter lacking the conserved gcc motif that represent a potential target for erfs. the data presented in figure 3c indicate that erf.c. <dig>  erf.d. <dig>  erf.f. <dig>  erf.f. <dig> and erf.f. <dig>  are capable to bind the e <dig> promoter and to repress its activity, suggesting that some erfs can be active on ethylene-responsive promoters lacking the canonical gcc box cis-element.

the data reveal that erf proteins are more active on the synthetic gcc promoter than on native complex promoters. the activity of the erfs on the gcc box  indicate that members of the same sub-class tend to modulate the activity of the target promoters in the same way . half of the erfs tested  have significant effect on the synthetic promoter while only  <dig> erfs are active on the native osmotin gcc-containing promoter and  <dig> on the native e <dig> lacking a conserved gcc motif.

the impact of the gcc box flanking regions on the binding affinity of erfs
we have previously demonstrated  <cit>  that erf proteins can display differential affinity to various promoters containing the highly conserved gcc-box. hence, the hypothesis that the nucleotide environment of the gcc box may impact the binding affinity of the erfs was tested. a total of  <dig> erfs representing all subfamily types were challenged with the native sl-chitinase gcc box  or with mutated versions of this motif in gel shift assay experiments . the four nucleotides flanking the gcc motif  were mutated and the binding of the erfs was tested by emsa and assessed by phosphoimaging. mutation of a at position  <dig>  into t or g dramatically decreased the affinity to the gcc box of all erfs except that of erf.f. <dig>  while the substitution of a <dig> by a c increases the affinity of all tested erfs. strikingly, mutation of a <dig> to any of the three other nucleotides resulted in a dramatic loss of affinity of erfs to the gcc box. these data suggest that nucleotides upstream  and downstream  to the gcc box impact the binding affinity in the same way for all the erfs tested. by contrast, substitution of g <dig> or c <dig> by another nucleotide resulted in different effect on the binding affinity depending on the erf tested .


expression pattern of erfs
to assist with the elucidation of the physiological function of tomato erfs, we sought to gain more insight on the spatio-temporal expression at the transcriptional level of each member of the gene family. transcript accumulation was assessed by qrt-pcr for  <dig> erfs whereas for the remaining three, transcripts could not be detected in the nine different plant tissues tested. the heatmap representation of the global expression pattern allowed the clustering of tomato erfs in three main clades , with clade i  corresponding to genes preferentially expressed in reproductive tissues, clade ii  corresponding to genes with an ubiquitous expression without tissue preference, and clade iii  mainly active in vegetative tissues. subclade ia displays a distinctive expression pattern associated with the breaker + <dig> and flower stages, while subclade ib contains genes whose expression is more pronounced at the breaker +  <dig> and breaker stages. these results suggest that some erfs operate specifically in vegetative tissues  or reproductive organs , whereas few erfs seem to be ubiquitous and might be involved in the development of various organs . interestingly some erfs are strongly expressed in b+ <dig> and flowers stage  suggesting a role in fruit set and during ripening while others seem to be active more specifically at the onset of ripening . these data also point out to the absence of a clear relationship between the structurally defined erf subclasses and their tissue type expression.


ethylene and auxin regulation of erf genes
it has been reported that beside their regulation by ethylene, erf genes can also be induced by other hormones among which auxin  <cit> . to test the responsiveness of tomato erf genes to ethylene and auxin, transcripts accumulation in seedlings treated with ethylene or auxin for  <dig> and 3 hours, respectively, was assessed by qrt-pcr. e <dig> and saur, known as ethylene and auxin-responsive genes, respectively, were used as controls to validate the hormone treatment. transcript accumulation levels  indicate that  <dig> tomato erfs are significantly induced  by ethylene and  <dig> significantly  down-regulated by this hormone. interestingly, the expression of up to  <dig> erfs is also positively regulated by auxin. among these,  <dig> erf genes  are up-regulated by both hormones whereas erf.f. <dig> undergo opposite regulation by auxin and ethylene. more surprisingly,  <dig> erf genes  are significantly up-regulated by auxin while they are not responsive to ethylene.


discussion
a wide range of developmental processes are known to rely at least partly on ethylene action, yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying the diversity of plant responses to this hormone are still awaiting some in depth characterization. the present study brings new insight on structural features that impact the binding affinity of ethylene response factors  to ethylene responsive promoters. upstream of erfs, the ethylene signal propagates via a linear transduction pathway which can hardly account for the wide range of ethylene responses. in its downstream part, ethylene signalling leads to the activation of erfs that are encoded by one of the largest multigene family of transcription factors  <cit> , and these transcriptional mediators may therefore represent one of the main step where the diversity and selectivity of ethylene responses can take place. the structural and functional characterisation of tomato erfs carried out here provides some clues to the means by which ethylene selects target genes that are required to bring into play the appropriate physiological responses in a tissue-specific and developmentally defined manner. taking advantage of the recent release of the complete annotated tomato genome sequence  <cit> , a genome wide in silico screening identified  <dig> genes encoding putative ap2-containing proteins distributed into  <dig> erfs,  <dig> drebs,  <dig> ap <dig> and  <dig> ravs . subsequently, the functional analysis concentrated on  <dig> members of the tomato erf family encompassing  <dig> of the  <dig> subclasses of the gene family.

the data indicate that all erf proteins display a clear nuclear localization, even though three members of the family lack any predictable nuclear targeting motif suggesting that their import to the nucleus may occur by a non-conventional localization signal or they might be conveyed to this compartment via an interaction with a yet unknown nuclear localized partner.

the large diversity among erfs is well illustrated by the presence of distinctive motifs that are sufficient to discriminate between different subclasses. recent studies already suggested a link between the structural classification of erfs and their physiological function  <cit> , yet, this hypothesis has not been supported by strong experimental data at the level of whole erf family. it was reported that within class e, the conserved specific n-terminal domain, initially described in tomato erfs  <cit> , is dedicated to an oxygen dependent sequence of post-translational modifications that leads to degradation of the protein under aerobic conditions. in hypoxia condition, the rap <dig>  erf protein is relocated from plasma membrane to nucleus to activate gene expression associated with hypoxia acclimation  <cit> . these results suggest that members of the subclass e are involved in hypoxia response.

transient expression assays indicated that the activity of erfs on synthetic gcc box promoter correlates well with their structural classification. that is, erfs from subclass c are strong activators and those belonging to subclasses a, b and e are weak activators, whereas members of subclass f are clear repressors. by contrast, erfs from subclasses g and h display no activity when challenged with the gcc box. noteworthy, erfs show weaker activity on the native complex osmotin promoter than on the synthetic promoter. this may be due to the high basal expression displayed by the native osmotin promoter in the absence of erf effectors, which likely minimizes the induction effect observed in the presence of erfs . moreover, the experimental data show that erfs can regulate transcription from both types of ethylene–responsive promoters either containing  or lacking  the gcc-box thus revealing their capacity to bind cis-elements without the canonical gcc motif. while it cannot be ruled out that erfs may induce indirectly the e <dig> promoter through the activation of primary target genes encoding transcriptional proteins active on the e <dig> promoter, our data suggest that erfs can interact with other cis-acting elements beside the canonical gcc motif. this is in agreement with recent studies demonstrating that, in addition to the gcc box, erfs can bind cis-acting elements such as vwre and gcc-like  <cit> . the clustering of the erf proteins according to their activity on the gcc box, indicates that members of the same subclass tend to modulate the activity of the target promoters in the same way . while the data show that the repressor and activator activities of erfs correlate well with their structural classification, the recognition of the gcc-box by a particular erf seems to depend on the promoter used and might be impacted by the nucleotide environment surrounding the cis-acting element.

indeed, gel shift assay experiments show that the environment of the gcc box greatly impacts the affinity of erf proteins to the conserved cis-element. in particular, the data  clearly demonstrate that the nature of the nucleotides at position n <dig> and n <dig> can have different and sometime opposite effect on different erfs, thus suggesting that these bases contribute to the binding specificity of various erfs to target promoters. taking together these results suggest that the two nucleotides directly flanking the gcc box at position n <dig> and n <dig> are essential for the binding of any erf to the gcc-box and, therefore, their nature determines whether or not the cis-element is functional for the binding to an erf. by contrast, the nature of nucleotides at position n <dig> and n <dig> can either enhance or reduce the binding affinity, which supports their contribution in determining the binding specificity of various erfs to target promoters. previous work carried out with native promoters already stressed the putative role of the gcc box flanking regions in impacting the binding activity of the erfs  <cit> . the same study also postulated that variation in amino acid composition within the binding domain may also impact the binding affinity of erfs to their target promoters  <cit> . it was also postulated that the conserved motifs lying outside the dna binding domain may also contribute to the differential affinity displayed by erf proteins towards the gcc box-containing promoters. recent study demonstrated that the trans-activating activity of some erfs was localized in the acidic domain  <cit> . in keeping with this observation, erf.d. <dig> and erf.d. <dig> are lacking the acidic activator domain and accordingly are unable to activate the synthetic gcc box promoter. on the other hand, subclasses a, b, c and e erfs harbour one or more acidic domains, however, not all of them display transcriptional activation of the synthetic promoter. members of class f have an ear repressor domain in the c-terminal region of the protein and accordingly they are all repressors of the activity of the gcc box-containing promoters.

unravelling the expression pattern of erf genes provides important clues towards the elucidation of their physiological function since physiological effects of transcriptional mediators not only depend on their activation or repression function, but also on their specific pattern of expression. while consistent with previous description concerning the expression of some erf genes like pti <dig> <cit>  and erf1- <dig> <cit> , the data distinguish different erf groups depending on whether they are preferentially expressed in vegetative, or reproductive tissues or whether they show ubiquitous expression with no tissue preference. noteworthy, structural subclasses did not display tissue or organ specialisation as exemplified by the fruit development process throughout which erfs from structurally distinct subclasses are expressed from flower anthesis to fruit ripening. this could be in line with the hypothesis that different responses to ethylene taking place in different tissues and at different developmental stages are mediated by different erf proteins. tissue and abiotic stress expression pattern of tomato erfs has been already reported  <cit> , however, the hormone-dependent expression remained unknown. as expected, a high number of erf genes are ethylene-responsive with  <dig> erfs being up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated upon ethylene treatment. less expected, our study revealed that up to  <dig> tomato erf genes were regulated by auxin among which  <dig> undergo double regulation by ethylene and auxin while the remaining  <dig> others are exclusively auxin-responsive. it was already reported that, beside ethylene, erfs can be regulated by salicylic acid and jasmonic acid  <cit> , but the auxin regulation of such a high number of erf genes has not been reported. the auxin regulation of the erfs shown to be active on ethylene responsive promoters, suggests their potential contribution to the cross-talk between the two hormones. the phytohormones auxin and ethylene are essential regulators of plant development and it is well documented that ethylene and auxin regulate common physiological aspects such as hook formation  <cit> , root hair differentiation  <cit> , root elongation  <cit> , root growth  <cit> , and hypocotyl phototropism  <cit> . the mechanisms underlying the interactions between the two hormones are becoming better understood even though only few molecular players of this cross-talk have been identified so far. besides acting independently on the same target genes, ethylene and auxin can mutually regulate each other’s biosynthesis and response pathways. in support to this idea, we previously reported that the down-regulation of sl-iaa <dig>  encoding a tomato transcriptional regulator from the aux/iaa type, results in phenotypic responses related to classical auxin and ethylene-regulated processes  <cit> . therefore, uncovering the auxin responsiveness of some members of the erf gene family, may define new actors potentially involved in the cross-talk between the two hormones. global transcriptomic analyses of tomato lines under-expressing sl-iaa <dig>  another tomato aux/iaa gene  <cit> , revealed the altered expression of a high number of ethylene-related genes, further supporting the idea of an active link between auxin and ethylene signalling during the flower to fruit transition. in keeping with the complex role of erfs in mediating various hormone responses, erf.a. <dig> and erf.d. <dig> that are highly expressed in mature flowers, display strong up-regulation by auxin but not by ethylene. on the other hand, erf.a. <dig> and erf.c. <dig> are up-regulated by ethylene but not by auxin, and they are strongly expressed in the flower. interestingly, many erfs are expressed in flower and at early ripening stages , suggesting their putative auxin-dependent role in fruit set and fruit ripening process.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study provides some molecular clues on how erfs can contribute to the specificity and selectivity of ethylene responses through  the differential expression of the gene family members,  the ability to negatively or positively impact transcriptional activity and,  the capacity to select with specificity their target genes based on the nucleotide environment of the gcc-box. considering the diversity of their transcriptional activity and expression patterns, erfs possess the necessary features for channelling ethylene signalling to a selected set of genes required for the appropriate developmental responses or the desired responses to environmental cues. the insight gained in this study opens new prospects towards assigning a specific role for individual erfs in controlling developmental processes and for identifying the direct target genes for each member of the erf family.
