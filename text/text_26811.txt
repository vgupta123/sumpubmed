BACKGROUND
capsaicin is the compound responsible for the pungency of peppers  <cit> . capsaicin and its analogs are called capsaicinoids, and the fundamental structure of most capsaicinoids is a branched-chain fatty acid amide of vanillylamine. capsaicinoids, produced only by species of the genus capsicum, are specifically synthesized in placental tissues, mostly between  <dig> and 30 days after flowering  in the pepper fruits of pungent cultivars  <cit> . capsaicinoids are used in the human diet for their distinct pungent taste and bioactivities, such as thermogenesis  <cit>  and the suppression of fat accumulation  <cit> . in addition, they are used for pharmaceutical purposes because they have potential bioactivities that are ascribed to antioxidants  <cit>  and anti-cancer agents  <cit> . although pungency in peppers is a desirable trait, nonpungent cultivars also have been developed as vegetables. nonpungent cultivars have been shown either to accumulate very few capsaicinoids or to accumulate capsinoids, such as capsiate, which are capsaicinoid analogs  that lack the stimuli of the capsaicinoids  <cit> .

two pathways are involved in capsaicin biosynthesis:  the phenylpropanoid pathway derived from phenylalanine leading to vanillylamine; and  the branched-chain fatty acid pathway derived from valine leading to 8-methyl-6-nonenoyl-coa  <cit> . the condensation reaction of vanillylamine with 8-methyl-6-nonenoyl-coa is thought to be catalyzed by a coenzyme a-dependent acyltransferase. although the genes involved in capsaicinoid synthesis have been extensively studied, the gene responsible for the acylation of vanillylamine remained unknown until kim et al.  <cit>  reported the sb2- <dig> clone as a possible candidate. stewart et al.  <cit>  finally showed that sb2- <dig> was the putative acyltransferase involved in capsaicinoid production and encoded by at <dig> gene, namely pungent gene  <dig>  as capsaicin synthase . the expression profile of pun <dig> correlates with pepper pungency and the deletion or down-regulation of the pun <dig> gene results in a decreased accumulation of capsaicinoids. in addition to capsaicinoids, pun <dig> has been reported to control capsinoid synthesis in nonpungent pepper cultivars  <cit> .

another important step in capsaicin biosynthesis is the conversion of vanillin to vanillylamine, and a putative aminotransferase  has been proposed to be the enzyme responsible for vanillin’s transamination. the full-length cdna clone of pamt was identified from a cdna library by differential display  <cit> . abraham-juárez et al.  <cit>  showed reduced capsaicinoid levels using virus-induced gene silencing  against pamt, providing evidence that the putative pamt gene was involved in capsaicinoid biosynthesis. in addition, lang et al.  <cit>  reported that the capsaicinoids were poorly synthesized in a spontaneous mutant, cultivar ‘ch- <dig> sweet’, and that this phenotype was due to the loss-of-function of the pamt gene in the particular mutant. using this mutant, tanaka et al.  <cit>  analyzed the defective pamt gene in detail and found that a single amino acid substitution was responsible for the capsaicin deficiency.

very recently, pamt was demonstrated, using an escherichia coli-expressed recombinant enzyme, to act as a vanillin aminotransferase  <cit> . however, pun <dig> is considered a putative gene because its encoded enzyme has not been biochemically analyzed, even though functional genomics studies indicate that pun <dig> is responsible for the acylation of vanillylamine and vanillyl alcohol in capsicum sp.  <cit> . in the present study, we used protoplasts and anti-pun <dig> antibodies to verify that the pun <dig> gene is actually involved in the crucial step of capsaicin biosynthesis. in addition, we investigated the expression profiles for two important genes, pamt and pun <dig>  in capsaicin biosynthesis and discussed the roles of pamt and pun <dig> in various pepper cultivars that differ in pungency.

RESULTS
preparation of anti-pun <dig> antibodies against the pun <dig> protein to antagonize endogenous pun <dig> activity in an in vitro assay
to verify that the pun <dig> protein  is the actual acyltransferase for capsaicin production, we first developed an in vitro assay system for capsaicin synthesis using recombinant pun <dig> proteins, which are produced from the cdna clone of pun <dig> inserted into an e. coli expression vector. however, in preliminary experiments, we were not able to use recombinant pun <dig> proteins in the enzymatic activity assay because they were mostly insoluble when expressed in e. coli, as reported previously  <cit> . alternatively, we produced anti-pun <dig> antibodies using the e. coli-synthesized pun <dig> protein and tried to use them as antagonists of endogenous pun <dig> activity in the in vitro assay system. to test the specificity of the created antibodies for the pun <dig> protein, we first conducted a western blot analysis using total proteins from a nonpungent bell pepper, which is defective in the pun <dig> gene, as a true negative control. as shown in figure  <dig>  we detected a very strong band in proteins from a pungent cultivar  at the expected size of 52 kda, whereas there was no 52 kda-signal in the bell pepper. we tested whether the antibodies cross-react with another acyltransferase, hydroxycinnamoyl transferase , which is also listed as a candidate enzyme in the capsaicinoid synthesis pathway  <cit> . the cdna of the pepper hct  with the flag tag sequence at the 3′ end was polymerase chain reaction -amplified and then synthesized as the hct-flag protein from in vitro-transcribed hct-flag mrna in a wheat germ system. the hct-flag protein was clearly detected by an anti-flag antibody, but not by the anti-pun <dig> antibodies, suggesting that the anti-pun <dig> antibodies did not cross-react with the pepper hct . to further confirm the antibody specificity, we used vigs to specifically reduce the expression level of pun <dig> mrna and analyzed the capsaicinoid accumulation in the virus-infected pepper placenta. a 95-nt sequence of pun <dig> was inserted in the cucumber mosaic virus  vector  to induce rna silencing against pun <dig> mrna. the pepper fruits infected with the virus vector containing the pun <dig> insert showed no apparent differences from those infected with the empty vector. compared with healthy fruits, the virus-infected fruits were a little smaller but no great differences were observed. the quantitative reverse-transcription -pcr analysis confirmed that the pun <dig> mrna levels were greatly reduced in the cmv-yd:cs95-infected placental tissues  in which the capsaicin accumulation was significantly reduced . we next examined the pun <dig> protein accumulation levels using a western blot analysis with the anti-pun <dig> antibodies. as shown in figure 2b, the pun <dig> accumulation levels were indeed reduced in the cmv-yd:cs95-infected placental tissues compared with those of the healthy and cmv-yd-infected control tissues. these results suggest that the pun <dig> expression was specifically reduced by vigs, and that the anti-pun <dig> antibodies could detect the reduced levels of the pun <dig> protein in a western blot. consistent with those results, the capsaicinoid content in the same placental tissues infected with cmv-yd:cs <dig> was also reduced to between ~25% and 33% of the control content . the reduced level of the pun <dig> protein detected by our antibodies reasonably reflected the reduced levels of capsaicinoid, and thus, we concluded that the specificity of the antibodies for the pun <dig> protein was satisfactory.figure  <dig>

evidence that the pun1-encoded enzyme can catalyze capsaicin synthesis
as described above, we produced anti-pun <dig> antibodies using the e. coli-synthesized pun <dig> protein and used the antibodies as antagonists of pun <dig> activity. to develop an in vitro assay system for capsaicin synthesis, we first prepared cell-free crude enzyme extracts from the placental tissue of a pungent pepper and then added vanillylamine. however, we were not able to detect any de novo-synthesized capsaicinoid, probably owing to an unknown inhibitor. we therefore isolated protoplasts from placental tissues and used them for the assay . in this assay, cs would be released from the protoplasts soon after the cells are broken, which occurs when vanillylamine is added. in the protoplast-based assay, we were able to detect de novo-synthesized capsaicin . capsaicinoid synthesis requires 8-methyl-6-nonenoyl-coa, as well as vanillylamine, as substrates, but 8-methyl-6-nonenoyl-coa is not commercially available. in our protoplast-based assay, 8-methyl-6-nonenoyl-coa was provided from the placental protoplasts, leading to capsaicin synthesis. using this assay system, we analyzed whether the addition of the anti-pun <dig> antibodies to the reaction would prevent de novo capsaicinoid synthesis. as we expected, the addition of anti-pun <dig> antibodies significantly reduced capsaicin synthesis to less than half of the control without anti-pun <dig> antibodies , suggesting that the pun <dig> protein plays an essential role in capsaicin synthesis.figure  <dig>

comparisons of expression levels of pamt and pun <dig> between pungent and nonpungent cultivars
to understand the roles of pamt and pun <dig> in capsaicinoid accumulation, we analyzed the gene expression levels of pamt and pun <dig> in various pepper cultivars that differ in pungency. we extracted rna from the placental tissues  <dig> daf and analyzed the expression levels of pamt using quantitative rt-pcr . the expression levels of pamt were significantly higher in the pungent varieties than in the mildly pungent and nonpungent varieties, while pamt transcripts were barely detectable in the nonpungent varieties, suggesting that the more pungent the variety, the higher the pamt expression. we next measured the pun <dig> transcript levels using the same rna used for the analyses of pamt. as shown in figure 4b, the pun <dig> transcript levels were relatively high in the pungent cultivars, but very low in the nonpungent cultivars. just like for pamt, the more pungent the cultivar, the higher the pun <dig> expression. high-performance liquid chromatography  analyses showed that the pungent cultivars produced higher levels of capsaicin . thus, the accumulation levels of capsaicinoids seem to correlate with the expression levels of pun <dig> and pamt.figure  <dig>

when we examined the expression levels of pamt and pun <dig> over time using quantitative rt-pcr , as expected, the expression levels of pamt and pun <dig> were very high in the pungent cultivar ‘chosen’ but barely present in the nonpungent cultivar ‘fushimi’. it is noteworthy that pun <dig> mrna in ‘chosen’ decreased after  <dig> daf when capsaicin reached its maximum level in the placenta , whereas pamt mrna continued to increase even at  <dig> daf.figure  <dig>

comparison of vanillylamine contents between pungent and nonpungent varieties
to confirm that pun <dig>  rather than pamt, is the primary determinant of capsaicinoid accumulation during capsaicin synthesis, we compared vanillylamine levels between pungent and nonpungent cultivars. the hplc analyses showed significantly greater levels of vanillylamine in the placental tissues of nonpungent cultivars at  <dig> daf . this result was unexpected because we had initially thought that the vanillylamine contents would be relatively low owing to the low pamt expression in nonpungent cultivars. when we analyzed vanillylamine levels in immature placental tissues at  <dig> daf, vanillylamine was relatively abundant in the pungent cultivar compared with the nonpungent cultivar . thus, we assumed that most of the vanillylamine was efficiently converted to capsaicinoids by pun <dig>  which was present at high levels soon after vanillylamine synthesis in pungent cultivars at  <dig> daf. however, the very low levels of pun <dig> present in nonpungent cultivars were probably not sufficient to produce capsaicin despite the high accumulation of vanillylamine. however, low levels of pamt were still capable of converting vanillin to vanillylamine in nonpungent cultivars. thus, we hypothesize that pun <dig> is a more critical regulator of capsaicin synthesis than pamt.figure  <dig>

discussion
previous knockdown experiments of the pamt and pun <dig> genes by vigs demonstrated that the down-regulation of these genes resulted in reduced capsaicinoid contents in fruits  <cit> , indicating that both genes are responsible for the last steps in capsaicinoid synthesis. in this study, we obtained a similar result with the vigs targeting of the pun <dig> gene using the cmv vector. the whole-genome sequencing of pepper revealed that there were three copies of the at <dig>  gene  <cit> . according to their genome structures and fruit-specific gene expression levels, at3-d <dig> and at3-d <dig> may be functional in capsaicinoid biosynthesis. because they are very similar at the 95 nt long target sequence for vigs, we assumed that both genes were simultaneously down-regulated by vigs. we then compared the expression levels of the pamt and pun <dig> genes and the capsaicin accumulation levels between pungent and nonpungent cultivars. the quantitative rt-pcr analyses indicated that the capsaicinoid levels correlated well with the expression levels of both pamt and pun <dig>  with expression of the two genes in the pungent cultivars being 50- to 100-fold higher than in the nonpungent cultivars. these results strongly suggest that capsaicinoid levels  are primarily determined by the expression levels of both pamt and pun <dig>  which are exclusive to the pungent cultivars. presently, we cannot completely eliminate the possibility that the enzymatic activities of pamt and/or pun <dig> differ between pungent and nonpungent cultivars. however, it is unlikely that the enzymatic activities of pamt and/or pun <dig> are the determinants of pepper pungency over their transcriptional levels because their mrna levels in the nonpungent cultivars ranged from extremely low to undetectable in our experiments. thus, the enzymes per se do not accumulate in the placenta, regardless of their activity levels. the accumulation of the at <dig>  protein is reported to be closely correlated with the level of at <dig>  transcripts in the pungent cultivar ‘thai hot’  <cit> . additionally, pun <dig> is highly expressed in the pungent cultivar c. chinense ‘habanero’ at the transcript and protein levels, but was hardly detectable in the nonpungent cultivars c. annuum ‘maor’ and c. chinense nmca <dig>  <cit> . these reports indicate that capsaicinoid biosynthesis may be regulated primarily at the transcription level. although the pamt expression level in the nonpungent cultivar c. annuum ‘ch- <dig> sweet’ was reported to be comparable with that in the pungent cultivars, this would be an exceptional case because ‘ch- <dig> sweet’ accumulates capsinoids instead of capsaicinoids  <cit> .

the transamination of vanillin to vanillylamine and the acylation of vanillylamine with a branched-chain fatty acid are critical steps in the biosynthesis of capsaicinoids  <cit> . the most plausible candidate genes for the acylation, pun <dig>  and the putative aminotransferase gene, pamt, have been highly correlated with capsaicinoid accumulation in several genetic studies of mutant alleles that corresponded to either pamt or pun <dig>  <cit> . however, because the enzymatic activities of pamt and/or pun <dig> may differ between the pungent and nonpungent cultivars, we should be able to measure the enzymatic activities of the enzymes. thus, biochemical verifications will still be necessary to determine whether these putative genes are the real players in the pathway. recently, based on bioinformatics analyses, single nucleotide polymorphisms in the pun <dig> locus were found to distinguish pungent from nonpungent cultivars  <cit> . this suggests that pun <dig> is indeed the locus responsible for the qualitative effect on pungency in pepper cultivars and that the enzymatic activity of pun <dig> may be categorized into two levels, which determine whether a cultivar will be pungent or not. since kim et al.  <cit>  reported that cdna clone sb2- <dig> is identical to the pun <dig> gene, pun <dig> has been suspected to be the actual cs, but there has been no cell-free system to synthesize capsaicin. purified proteins with cs activity have suffered from contamination with endogenous capsaicinoids; therefore, researchers must use a radioactive substrate, which is not commercially available. here, we overcame these technical difficulties by using protoplasts isolated from placental tissues of a pungent cultivar. this protoplast-based assay is so simple and easy that comparative experiments assessing pun <dig> activities among pepper cultivars are now possible. in addition, this system can be used for other purposes, such as measuring other enzymatic activities and screening for capsaicin synthesis inhibitors.

even though the transcript levels of both pamt and pun <dig> were very low in the nonpungent cultivars compared with the pungent cultivars, the vanillylamine levels were five times higher in the nonpungent cultivars than in the pungent cultivars at  <dig> daf . although these results seem to contradict each other, one possible explanation is that the vanillylamine synthesized in the pungent cultivars was quickly converted to capsaicin by the high pun <dig> enzyme activity . according to this hypothesis, which is based on an expression time course of pamt and pun <dig> relative to the vanillylamine accumulation levels, vanillylamine must be efficiently synthesized in nonpungent cultivars even when there is a very low pamt expression level at  <dig> daf. from this point of view, the nonpungent feature is substantially determined by the loss of function of pun <dig> , and thus the nonpungent phenotype, with relatively high vanillylamine levels, was determined essentially by low expression levels of pun <dig> but not of pamt. therefore, pun <dig> would be the primary determinant of vanillylamine, as well as capsaicin, accumulation. a nonpungent cultivar c. annuum ‘ch- <dig> sweet’  <cit>  was shown to accumulate less vanillylamine than pungent cultivars, but this case is exceptional because ‘ch- <dig> sweet’ must have enough pun <dig> activity to accumulate a high capsinoids  content, unlike the nonpungent cultivars used in this study that showed very low pun <dig> expression levels.

CONCLUSIONS
to verify that the pun <dig> gene is actually involved in the final step of capsaicin biosynthesis, we raised antibodies against the e. coli-synthesized pun <dig> protein and used them as antagonists of endogenous pun <dig> activity. after confirmation of the antibodies’ specificity, we developed an in vitro cell-free assay for de novo capsaicin synthesis using protoplasts from placental tissues. the addition of anti-pun <dig> antibodies significantly reduced de novo capsaicin synthesis in the protoplast assay, demonstrating that the pun1-encoded protein played an essential role in capsaicin synthesis. analyses of the accumulation of vanillylamine, a precursor of capsaicin, revealed that nonpungent cultivars could accumulate much higher vanillylamine levels than pungent cultivars. this observation indicates that pun <dig> is the primary determinant of vanillylamine and capsaicin accumulation and is more important than pamt in maintaining capsaicin-free fruit in most nonpungent cultivars.
