BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, causing diseases which range in severity from otitis media and sinusitis, to pneumonia, septicaemia and meningitis  <cit> . s. pneumoniae is a commensal of the human nasopharynx  <cit> .

the diversity of pneumococci was first evidenced by serotyping of their capsular polysaccharides resolving into more than  <dig> serotypes  <cit> . however, only  <dig> serotypes cause approximately 90% of invasive disease worldwide  <cit> . due to the natural transformability in the pneumococcus, horizontal recombination allows that one serotype can belong to different genotypes, and a single genotype can express different capsule genes, i.e. different serotypes. this phenomenon is known as capsular switching  <cit> . capsular serotype may be more important than genotype in the ability of pneumococci to cause invasive disease  <cit> , but there are also some other investigations that underline the importance of genotypes as well  <cit> .

molecular tools, particularly dna-based methods using genetic polymorphism, have been developed to track the emergence and the spread of resistant, hyper virulent clones or shifts in serotype distribution detected for both non-invasive and invasive disease reported before or since the use of heptavalent protein-polysaccharide pneumococcal conjugate vaccine , in different countries  <cit> . among them, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis   <cit>  and multiple loci sequence typing   <cit>  are the most frequently used genotyping methods for s. pneumoniae. pfge is based on restriction enzyme pattern analysis; mlst is a sequence based method targeting  <dig> housekeeping genes. a s. pneumoniae specific mlst scheme targeting aroe, gdh, gki, recp, spi, xpt, and ddl was developed  <cit>  together with an online identification page at http://www.mlst.net <cit> . pfge and mlst have been extensively compared  <cit>  and both have proven their capacity to discriminate efficiently among genotypes. however pfge lacks, in some extend, of inter-laboratories reproducibility and mlst is expensive thus may be not affordable for large scale studies. availability of genome data greatly facilitated the search for polymorphic dna sequences. among them, polymorphic tandem repeat sequences also called variable number of tandem repeats  are an interesting class of genetic markers; multiple alleles may be present at a single locus, and size differences are easily resolved by electrophoresis of pcr products. vntr has proved to be highly relevant for the typing of pathogenic bacterial species . a s. pneumoniae- multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis  scheme was developed with a dedicated web-based database at http:/http://www.mlva.eu <cit> . it targets  <dig> distinct loci and was used initially to characterise pneumococcal isolates from burkina faso  <cit> . although discriminatory power of mlva has been demonstrated, the large number of loci included in the scheme may be a limitation for its use on large scale studies .

this study aims at confirming the relevance of mlva of s. pneumoniae, comparing mlst and mlva performances when discriminating subgroups of strains belonging to the same sequence type , and defining a restricted but universal set of mlva markers that has at least the same discriminatory power as mlst by comparing the population genetic structure of s. pneumoniae using different published sets of markers  <cit> .

methods
bacterial strains
 <dig> invasive isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae from the health protection agency collection, london, uk, collected during the period 2002– <dig>  were selected among the  <dig> major mlst sequence types , circulating in england and wales , with approximately  <dig> isolates per st. selection included serotypes commonly associated with these sts and all possible serotype variants  identified in the hpa collection. isolates were serotyped by slide agglutination against the full antisera panel from the danish statens serum institute  as part of the systemic and respiratory infection laboratory  reference service. the isolates were collected from blood , cerebral spin fluid , pleural fluid , abscess , and bronchial aspirate .

bold mts are referring to singletons.

methods
mlva was performed as previously described  <cit> . the first  <dig> vntrs  were used. the last one  unsuccessfully amplified dna from the isolates or the reference strains and therefore was avoid in this study. for convenience, the nomenclature “spneu” meaning streptococcus pneumoniae was replaced by “ms” meaning minisatellite in this paper.

data analysis
the genetic diversity was measured by the hunter-gaston diversity index  on http://www.hpa-bioinformatics.org.uk/cgi-bin/dici/dici.pl. a high di with a narrow confident interval  indicates accurate measurement of a highly variable locus. these loci may be sufficiently variable to be used as an indicator to discriminate between samples or as a starting point for assay development.

the genetic distances between two isolates i and j were calculated as following: 

 di,j=no.non-identical markersno.markers used 

one marker difference is equivalent to 15%, 5/ <dig> different is 70%. in our study, the criteria sets provided by either mlva or mlst analysis consider two strains similar having at least 70% similarity, i.e. a dlv difference. the interest of the method is to quantify the difference.

the minimum spanning trees by mlst using the  <dig> house keeping genes and by mlva were constructed using bionumerics ver.  <dig>  with the categorical coefficient. priority rules were fixed as following: maximum number of i) single-locus variants ; ii) slvs and double-locus variants ; iii) maximum neighbour minimum cluster size of two loci  and  <dig> st, when the seven housekeeping gene markers were used by mlst; iv) maximum neighbour minimum cluster size of two loci  and  <dig> mt, when  <dig> markers were used and one locus  and  <dig> mt when  <dig> markers are used by mlva.

the congruence among distance matrices mlst/mlva was calculated in % of difference of the genetic distance between two isolates depending on the number of markers used using bionumerics ver. <dig>  as well.

the inter-matrix difference  was calculated using the formula below, where d is the genetic distance between i and j, and n the number of isolates. marker numbers refer to table  <dig>  the lower the imd value is the closest is the distance matrices given by the two techniques.

 imd=∑di,jmlva−di,jmlstnn−1/ <dig> 

the marker name contains all the numbers necessary to characterize the marker in reference to a given sequenced genome . for example, in “ms15_507bp_45bp_7u”, - ms means minisatellite, -  <dig> bp is the size of the amplification product of this marker; -  <dig> bp is the size of the repeat unit, -  <dig> is the number of repeats. markers used by authors are noticed by a cross , authors seven markers set are noticed as following:  this paper,  pichon’s and  elberse’s. the mlst/mlva congruence in percent by author is indicated at the bottom of the table.

RESULTS
the discriminatory power of mlva was compared to that of mlst by analysing  <dig> isolates of s. pneumoniae which had been previously serotyped and composed  <dig> sequence types. the discriminatory power was analysed in two steps: first by the analysis of the population including its composition and the genetic diversity using  <dig> markers, then by analysing the genetic diversity of this population using sets of  <dig> markers described by different authors  <cit> .

the genetic diversity of the  <dig> isolates of s. pneumoniae was assessed by mlva by using  <dig> markers . a total of  <dig> mlva types  were identified and clustered into  <dig> clonal complexes and  <dig> singletons by minimum spanning tree analysis . di >  <dig>  was achieved for three loci: ms <dig>  ms <dig> and ms <dig>  which represent the most discriminatory effect. the congruence between mlst and mlva was estimated at 67% . the locus variation using mlst is a dlv between st <dig> and st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig>  and a slv between st <dig> and st <dig> . other st had  <dig> loci difference. mlva underlines genetic variability within mlst types. st <dig>  st <dig> and st  <dig> are more clonal than the others, whereas st  <dig> is much more diversified by mlva than by mlst, and st <dig> and st <dig> presented a unique pattern. st <dig> is either grouped with st <dig> to form a clonal complex or is forming a clonal complex by itself with a  <dig> locus difference. isolates of st <dig> formed two distinct mlva complexes , one mainly associated with serotype  <dig> f  and the other one  associated with  <dig> v, suggesting independent evolutionary biology following divergence from a st <dig> common ancestor combined with capsular switching event. moreover, serotype  <dig>  which is an invasive serotype was shown to be a variant of st <dig> and  <dig> v  <cit> , and therefore, was clustered within st156/ <dig>  other isolates of serotype  <dig> st <dig> are well separated from st156/ <dig> 

knowing the mlva type it is possible to deduce not only the st but also the associated serotype depending on the clonality of the serotypes. it is the case for serotype  <dig> because of its strong clonality, whereas it is not possible for the serotype 19f. moreover, the carriage is more frequent for certain serotypes, particularly serotype 19f, meaning that isolates belonging to those serotypes often exchange dna with other carried. so the serotype of a pneumococcus strain can change but not its other genetic characteristics’. indeed, carriage serotypes are distributed along the dendrogram and can belong to very different genotypes.

however, in order to compare identical number of mlst and mlva markers, a set of seven mlva markers was considered. the set includes three markers with the highest discriminatory power , one marker with a low discriminatory power acting as an anchor for the dendrogram, and three others, selected for a low imd and for their ability to distinguish st  <dig> and st  <dig>  and based on previous data  <cit> . the composition of the mlva set was adapted as follows: ms <dig>  ms <dig>  ms <dig>  ms <dig>  ms <dig>  ms <dig>  ms <dig> 

the comparison between mlst and mlva using seven markers was obtained by construction of a minimum spanning tree . congruence mlst/mlva was  <dig> %.

then, congruence between mlst and mlva of the reduced mlva scheme was compared to those obtained when using the seven marker set elberse’s  <cit>   and the seven marker set pichon’s  <cit>  . elberse’s scheme was dedicated for studying the population structure of s. pneumoniae whilst pichon’s markers were selected based on the best combination for highest discriminatory power for outbreak investigation. the genetic distance between the  <dig> isolates determined by mlst and mlva and their congruence  was respectively  <dig> % ,  <dig> % . previously  <cit> , congruence mlst/mlva was estimated to 59% when the same set of isolates was analysed using markers ms <dig>  ms <dig>  ms <dig>  ms <dig>  ms <dig>  ms <dig> and ms <dig>  pichon’s markers gave similar congruence to the  <dig> marker set of this study, or the highest mlst/mlva congruence comparing the seven markers sets , but st227/st <dig> and st156/st <dig> were grouped within the same clonal complex. mlst/mlva results are coherent. indeed, a low genetic distance between two st is low between two corresponding mt.

applying sets of markers selected in two other studies on s. pneumoniae, to the population selected in this study, revealed  that  two markers ms <dig> and ms <dig>  are commonly used by all authors, including this study, and presented a high di whichever strains were used and the aim of the study,  several markers were never used: ms <dig>  ms <dig> and, ms <dig>   the other markers, ms <dig>  ms <dig> and ms <dig> were dependant on the method, i.e., the capacity to discriminate the clonal complexes,  st discriminant capacity using mlva varies depending on the set of marker used, and a high percentage of congruence does not mean a better discriminant capacity.

the selection of the markers except for ms <dig> and ms <dig> was dependant on the studied population. mlva based on this study , pichon’s , marker sets clustered the study population accordingly to mlst data whilst elberse’s  marker set gave a lower resolving of the population.

the results suggested that  <dig> out of the  <dig> markers previously described for s. pneumoniae, can be selected whatever the s. pneumoniae population considered.

in other words, analysis of strains with the same st but isolated in different countries will give similar results, i.e., many new mlva types associated with the same st can be identified as it was observed for niger strains  <cit>  . however, higher the number of markers is, more important the diversity of genotypes observed is. some markers are specific to the bacterial population  <cit> .

mlva can discriminate relevant subgroups among strains belonging to the same st, and offers the possibility to deduce the st from the mt.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study mlst and mlva were compared for their discriminatory power for s. pneumoniae populations with purpose to try to define a set of marker that can be used whatever the population and the aim of the study.

the study population was composed by  <dig> isolates belonging to the top  <dig> sts in england. mlva using  <dig> markers yields clustering of the isolates similar to that obtained by mlst. moreover, mlva permits to differentiate within st different clonal complexes, particularly st <dig> and st <dig>  our study showed that the number of vntr loci may be reduced to  <dig> to achieve a similar cluster pattern to mlst.

in conclusion, prior to any study,  <dig> markers only, have to be tested. then, the selection of  <dig> markers is based on mlva markers with a di >  <dig>   and a selection of others including one marker with a low discriminatory power acting as an anchor for the dendrogram, and  <dig> others depending of the population tested and the aim of the study. the set of markers, whose composition depends on the population studied, could be used either to investigate local outbreaks or to track the worldwide spread of clones and particularly the emergence of variants.
