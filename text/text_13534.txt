BACKGROUND
the genus artemisia, belonging to the asteraceae family, contains a large number of aromatic plants. during the latest decades, a. annua l.  has received increasing attention due to the fact that the plant produces the sesquiterpenoid endoperoxide artemisinin, which today is widely used for the treatment of malaria  <cit> . the plant produce relatively small amounts of artemisinin and a worldwide shortage of the drug has led to intense research in order to increase the yield of artemisinin in the plant or to develop alternative methods of artemisinin production  <cit> . artemisinin and a number of other terpenoids are produced in glandular secretory trichomes present on aerial surfaces of the plant. the glandular trichomes are 10-cell structures with three pairs of secretory cells  <cit> . the apical cells are transparent proplastid- or leucoplast-containing cells, and the two cell pairs below the apical cells, the sub-apical cells, are green chloroplast-containing cells. the substances that are produced in these cells are excreted into, and stored in the subcuticular sac, which is covering the secretory cells  <cit> . this has led to the focus on these structures when studying genes involved in terpene biosynthesis in general and for artemisinin biosynthesis in particular.

the major components of the essential oil from a. annua are mono- and sesquiterpenes produced in trichomes  <cit> . the large number of structurally different terpenoids indicates that several mono- and sesquiterpene synthases are expressed in a. annua. in fact, so far five different sesquiterpene synthases   <cit> , amorpha- <dig> -diene synthase   <cit> ; β-caryophyllene synthase   <cit> , germacrene a synthase   <cit>  and β-farnesene synthase   <cit>  have been cloned from the plant. however, it is likely that additional sesquiterpene synthases are expressed in a. annua since other classes of sesquiterpenes such as eudesmanes , guaianes , longipinanes  and santalanes  have been isolated from the plant  <cit> . all these sesquiterpene synthases may compete for the same substrate, farnesyl diphosphate , which is a precursor of artemisinin. consequently, the activity of various sesquiterpene synthases may influence the yield of artemisinin in the plant. in addition, fdp is used for the synthesis of squalene, which is the precursor of sterols and triterpenes.

the conversion of dihydroartemisinic acid to artemisinin is believed to be a non-enzymatic spontaneous reaction  <cit> . in a similar way, artemisinic acid is converted to arteannuin b as indicated in figure  <dig> <cit> .

recently, a dihydroartemisinic aldehyde reductase  has been cloned from a. annua  <cit> . this enzyme can potentially convert dihydroartemisinic aldehyde into dihydroartemisinic alcohol, a substance that appears to be a "dead end product", thereby affecting the yield of artemisinin in a negative way.

the genetic variation within a. annua appears to be high. at least two chemotypes with different compositions of the essential oil during the vegetative period have been described  <cit> . one chemotype shows high content of dihydroartemisinic acid and artemisinin, while the second chemotype shows high content of artemisinic acid and arteannuin b but low amounts of artemisinin. according to previous investigations, there is no conversion in planta of artemisinic acid to dihydroartemisinic acid or vice versa  <cit> . it has been suggested that arteannuin b can be converted to artemisinin in planta  <cit> .

in order to increase our understanding of terpene metabolism in the plant a. annua and to evaluate the competition for precursors, which may influence the yield of artemisinin in the plant, we have used qpcr to estimate the expression of genes of terpene metabolism in different plant tissues. cdna made from flower buds, young leaves, old leaves, stems, roots and hairy roots has been used as templates for the qpcr studies. in total,  <dig> different transcripts have been monitored using three reference genes. the different tissues have also been studied by fluorescence microscopy to determine trichome densities.

RESULTS
trichomes
the glandular trichomes of a. annua have been extensively studied and it is well established that the production of specific terpenoids, including artemisinin, takes place within the secretory cells of such trichomes  <cit> . furthermore the yield of terpenoids in various plants is highly dependent on trichome abundance  <cit> . in order to investigate the differences in trichome density on different plant tissues, glandular trichomes of a. annua were visualized by fluorescence microscopy  and found in all aerial tissues of the plant such as flower buds , leaves , stems  at different densities, but as expected not on roots  or hairy root cultures of a. annua .

from figure  <dig>  it is evident that young leaves  carry considerably higher density of trichomes than older leaves . all these tissues were taken from 5- <dig> months old plants with flower buds, which had been induced by a  <dig> days short day treatment . we have estimated, by counting trichomes, that on young leaves there are around 300± <dig> trichomes/cm <dig> while the corresponding number for old leaves was  <dig> ±  <dig> trichomes/cm <dig>  the original number of trichomes seem to be spread out on a larger surface as the leaf expands with age.

gene expression
in order to examine the gene expression of  <dig> enzymes of terpene metabolism and three reference transcripts by qpcr,  <dig> primer pairs were synthesized as listed in table  <dig>  the efficiency of these primer pairs was calculated from the qpcr experiments and was found to be between  <dig>  and  <dig>  as summarized in table  <dig> 

the mean efficiency of the amplicons was calculated by the program linreg v.  <dig>  based on the log linear phase of the amplification curve. the transcripts in bold were used as reference genes in the calculation of expression ratios.

relative expression of genes of terpene metabolism in different tissues
the gene expression of the  <dig> enzymes of terpene metabolism was studied in different tissues of a. annua and the results are summarized in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  transcripts of all the genes studied could be detected in all tissues at different amounts using qpcr. the only exception was that no ads could be detected in roots. in figure  <dig>  expression levels in the different tissues are all compared separately to old leaves, which were arbitrary chosen as reference tissue. the results of the different experiments are presented below.

two independent triplet reactions were used for the calculation of average ct-values. n.d. = not detected. the rows in bold represent the reference samples. the transcripts labelled with # were analyzed in a separate experiment.

relative expression of genes encoding hmgr and fds in different tissues
the mevalonate pathway produces idp and dmadp for production of different types of terpenoids as summarized in figure  <dig>  one enzyme of the mevalonate pathway  has been studied by qpcr in this paper. our results show that hmgr was expressed at higher levels in biosynthetically active tissues such as flower buds, young leaves, roots and hairy roots. the ct-values for this transcript in these tissues were relatively low  indicating that hmgr was expressed at relatively high levels . hmgr is a rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway  <cit> , and recently it has been shown that hmgr expression limits artemisinin formation in a. annua  <cit> . the regulation of the mevalonate pathway by hmgr was reflected in the result that around 20- and 8-fold more expression was seen in highly biosynthetically active flower buds and young leaves, respectively, than in old leaves . stermer et al. showed that the hmgr activity is much reduced in mature tissues, correlating well with the results presented here  <cit> . it is interesting to note that hmgr also was enhanced 20-fold in roots. this might be due to the relatively rapid growth of roots and the requirement for sterols and protective terpenoids  <cit> .

farnesyl diphosphate synthase  plays a central role in the conversion of idp and dmadp, produced by the mevalonate pathway, to various terpenoids such as sterols and sesquiterpenes. a small gene family encodes isoenzymes of fds in plants. fds <dig> is a housekeeping gene as it is expressed in all tissues at all developmental stages  <cit> . it is involved in the synthesis of isoprenoids serving basic plant cell functions such as production of sterols for various membranes. overexpression of fds <dig> in a. annua results in an increase in artemisinin production  <cit>  indicating that it is a rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway. fds <dig> is often inducible and found in special tissues at particular stages of development  <cit>  and is also involved in phytoalexin biosynthesis. fds <dig>  <cit>  and fds <dig>  have been cloned from a. annua. the two fds genes from a. annua show  <dig> % nucleotide sequence identity and the segment that was amplified with the primers used  is identical in the two genes. consequently, the expression of both genes was monitored in our qpcr experiments. from figure  <dig> it is evident that the total expression of fds1/fds <dig> is essentially the same in all tissues, and the relatively small variation observed may be explained by the fact that the housekeeping gene fds <dig> constitutes a major part of total fds1/fds <dig> and that the eventual different level of fds <dig> expression in different tissues thereby becomes masked.

relative expression of genes of the mep pathway in different tissues
the mep pathway produces the precursors for many different terpenoids as shown in figure  <dig>  three of the eight enzymes of the mep pathway, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase , 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductase  and hydroxy-2-methyl-2--butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase , have been studied by qpcr in this paper. our results show that the expression of dxs was 7-8-fold higher in flower buds and young leaves compared to old leaves . it is well established that dxs, the first enzyme of the mep pathway, plays a major role in the overall regulation of the pathway  <cit> . higher expression of dxs leads to an enhanced production of idp and dmadp, which may influence the synthesis of terpenoids in the plastid. however, an enhanced dxs activity may also influence the production of artemisinin since it has recently been shown that one c5-unit of fdp, the precursor of artemisinin, is produced by the mep pathway  <cit> . in the other tissues, the expression of dxs was equal to that in old leaves. dxr and hdr may also have rate-limiting roles for the production of idp and dmadp  <cit> . the expression of dxr appears to be somewhat enhanced in flower buds and hairy roots but lower in stems and roots. the expression of hdr was 10-30-fold higher in old leaves than in the other tissues.

relative expression of genes of artemisinin biosynthesis in different tissues
during the last decade, a number of enzymes of artemisinin biosynthesis have been cloned and a putative pathway has been constructed as outlined in figure  <dig>  we have monitored the expression of four genes  involved in the conversion of fdp to dihydroartemisinic acid, which is a late precursor of artemisinin  <cit> . we have also included red <dig> in these studies as it has been suggested that this enzyme may have an influence on the yield of artemisinin by withdrawing dihydroartemisinic aldehyde from further conversion to artemisinin  <cit> .

the first committed enzyme of artemisinin biosynthesis is ads  <cit> , which has been cloned by several investigators  <cit> . the next enzyme, cyp71av <dig>  was cloned by two groups independently  <cit> . the following two enzymes, dbr <dig> and aldh <dig>  were cloned and characterized by zhang et al.  <cit>  and teoh et al.  <cit> , respectively. finally, red <dig> was cloned and characterized by rydén et al.  <cit> .

in table  <dig> we summarize previous studies of gene expression of enzymes involved in artemisinin biosynthesis in a. annua. the specific expression of cyp71av <dig>  dbr <dig> and aldh <dig> in glandular trichomes of a. annua has been shown by pcr, and ads has been shown to be expressed in glandular trichomes by immuno gold staining in combination with silver enhancement  <cit> . the relative expression of these different genes cannot be compared since the data in table  <dig> is from several different studies and on different varieties of a. annua. it may, however, be concluded from table  <dig> that the biosynthetic enzymes are expressed in flower buds, leaves and stems that carry glandular trichomes but not in roots.

the results are not directly comparable between enzymes. an estimation based on published figures of the relative level of enzymes in different tissues is indicated with +-signs. - = no expression; n.d. = not determined.

in a. annua, dbr <dig> belongs to a small family of enolate reductases and a second enzyme of this family is 12-oxophytodienoate reductase , which in arabidopsis is involved in jasmonic acid biosynthesis  <cit> . the opr3-like gene of a. annua  shows a very high similarity to dbr <dig>  and in our initial attempt to determine the relative expression of dbr <dig>  a primer pair  with identical nucleotide sequence in the dbr <dig> and opr3-like sequences was used. consequently, the two transcripts were amplified simultaneously. the combined expression of these two genes is essentially the same in flower buds, young leaves and old leaves . however, a  <dig> bp deletion in the dbr <dig> sequence was thereafter used to design, by spanning this deletion, a reversed primer that is specific for dbr <dig>  using this primer, the expression of dbr <dig> could be determined as discussed below.

the qpcr data presented here clearly demonstrate that the expression levels of ads, cyp71av <dig>  dbr <dig> and aldh <dig> were very high in flower buds and young leaves compared to old leaves , i.e. ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> times more ads, ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> times more cyp71av <dig>  ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> times more dbr <dig> and ~ <dig> and ~ <dig> times more aldh <dig> in flower buds and young leaves, respectively. these high expression levels indicate a high capacity to produce artemisinin precursors in these tissues carrying biosynthetically active trichomes. these findings are supported by a study on the induction of enzymes involved in artemisinin biosynthesis by jasmonic acid  <cit> . it was shown by qpcr that the levels of ads, cyp71av <dig>  dbr <dig> and aldh <dig> were around  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> times higher in isolated trichomes  than in leaves, respectively  <cit> , which once again shows that the genes encoding enzymes of artemisinin biosynthesis are specifically expressed in trichomes.

even though a 70-150-fold difference in expression of the four genes was observed between young and old leaves, the trichome density on these tissues only differs around three times. obviously, the relative amount of the biosynthetic enzymes is much higher in young trichomes, and the regulation of expression of these enzymes appears to be linked to the developmental stage of the trichomes.

the qpcr data may be used to estimate the relative amount of transcripts using the 2-ΔΔct method  <cit>  and the β-actin as reference gene. as an example, we have made such an estimation for flower buds. for this crude estimation, we assume that the number of active sites is proportional to the level of transcription and that the enzymes are working at substrate saturation with an optimal nadph/nadp+ ratio. under such conditions the kcat-value is a good indicator of the conversion of substrate to product. consequently, we may calculate the relative turnover potential for the different enzymes. the values were normalized to red <dig>  due to its low abundance in flower buds. using published kcat-values for the different enzymes, we may calculate their relative turnover potential in planta as summarized in table  <dig>  for cyp71av <dig> no kcat-value is available and therefore this enzyme is not included in this estimation. it may be concluded that ads is a rate-limiting enzyme due to its low kcat-value and that the other trichome-specific enzymes dbr <dig> and aldh <dig>  are present in excess assuming that they are acting on the same pool of intermediates. due to differences in the kcat-value, aldh <dig> exhibits a 5-fold higher potential conversion of dihydroartemisinic aldehyde as compared to artemisinic aldehyde .

β-actin was used as reference gene. the ct-values for flower buds  were used for the calculations. the red <dig> gene was used for the normalization of values. substrates: aa, artemisinic aldehyde; aaoh, artemisinic alcohol; ad, amorpha- <dig> -diene; dhaa, dihydroartemisinic aldehyde; fdp, farnesyldiphosphate; gdp, geranyldiphosphate; idp, isopentenyldiphosphate.

from figure  <dig>  we may conclude that only part of the fds1/fds <dig> activity is present in trichomes and involved in artemisinin biosynthesis. in fact, it may be speculated that fds <dig> is a critical enzyme for the yield of artemisinin. if we assume that only one percent of the fds <dig> activity is found in trichome cells, the relative turnover potential is in the same range as ads. this assumption is supported by the fact that upregulation of fds by genetic transformation of a. annua using constitutive promoter resulted in an increased artemisinin production  <cit>  indicating that fds <dig> also may be a rate-limiting enzyme in artemisinin biosynthesis. however, due to the relative high potential conversion capacity of dbr <dig> and aldh <dig> it may be assumed that as amorpha- <dig> -diene is formed by ads, it is efficiently converted all the way to dihydroartemisinic acid, which accumulates in this chemotype of a. annua. this is supported by the fact that essentially no amorpha- <dig> -diene is detected by gc-ms of an hexane extract from this variety of a. annua . finally, since dihydroartemisinic acid accumulates in this chemotype, we may conclude that the activity of dbr <dig> is significantly higher than that of cyp71av <dig>  the fact that dbr <dig> is a soluble cytosolic protein while cyp71av <dig> is embedded in the er may influence the metabolic flow and the rate of intracellular transport of intermediates has to be considered. at present, we do not have any information on the transport of intermediates of artemisinin biosynthesis within cells. it would be interesting to study the ratio of dbr <dig> and cyp71av <dig> in the two different chemotypes of a. annua since these enzymes are the key enzymes for the formation of dihydroartemisinic acid and artemisinic acid, respectively.

next it may be concluded that red <dig> does not appear to have any significant influence on the biosynthesis of artemisinin, which was suggested by rydén et al.  <cit>  due to a high km for dihydroartemisinic aldehyde, low relative turnover potential and only partial localization to trichomes. expression of red <dig> in flower buds, young leaves and stems was relatively low and just a fraction of that observed in old leaves . furthermore, it is interesting to note that a high expression of red <dig> was observed in hairy roots of a. annua, i.e. around  <dig> times more than in old leaves . the function of red <dig> in hairy roots is not known but in this case the high red <dig> activity together with an extremely low aldh <dig> expression may influence the yield of artemisinin in hairy roots, which is relatively low  <cit> .

finally, no ads could be detected in roots of a. annua while small amounts were found in hairy roots. hairy roots produce as mentioned above small amounts of artemisinin. however, aldh <dig> was almost not detectable in hairy roots, which may lead to the formation of artemisinic acid and arteannuin b instead of artemisinin. these compounds have been isolated from hairy root cultures of a. annua  <cit> .

relative expression of genes of sesquiterpene biosynthesis in different tissues
in addition to ads, four other sesquiterpene synthases have been cloned from a. annua. these enzymes with very similar kinetic properties compete for the fdp available and may therefore influence the production of artemisinin precursors. three of these sesquiterpene synthases, i.e. cps, ecs and gas have been monitored by qpcr in this study.

the expression of ecs was much lower in flower buds and young leaves than in old leaves , while expression of cps and gas was considerably higher in these tissues as compared to old leaves. in old leaves, ecs appears to be the only sesquiterpene synthase highly expressed. the function of ecs in a. annua has not yet been established.

the relative amounts of the sesquiterpene synthases has been calculated using the 2-ΔΔct method  <cit>  for some tissues as summarized in table  <dig> using β-actin as reference. the values were normalized to gas expression in stems  due to its low abundance there. as can be seen in table  <dig>  ads is the dominating sesquiterpene synthase in flower buds and young leaves, i.e. the tissues where the biosynthesis of artemisinin precursors take place. it may be concluded that ads is capable to channel a major part of the available substrate into artemisinin biosynthesis. ma et al  <cit>  showed that upregulation of ads by genetic transformation of a. annua resulted in an increased formation of artemisinin showing that ads is a rate-limiting enzyme  <cit> .

the ct-values in table  <dig> were used for the calculations, and β-actin was used as reference gene. the gas gene in stems was used for the normalization of values.

relative expression of genes of sterol and triterpene biosynthesis in different tissues
a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of sterols and triterpenes is squalene synthase , which condensates two molecules of fdp to squalene. the expression of sqs varied only modest between different tissues in our qpcr study. sqs is a microsomal enzyme and difficult to purify and characterize. consequently, there is no reported kcat-value for any plant enzyme, but a kcat =  <dig>  sec- <dig> has been reported for a soluble recombinant yeast enzyme  <cit> . the a. annua enzyme has been cloned and is similar to the enzymes from a. thaliana and nicotiana tabacum  <cit> . as seen in table  <dig>  a significant amount of sqs was expressed in the tissues with high artemisinin biosynthesis. assuming a kcat-value for the a. annua sqs in the order of  <dig> sec- <dig> , results in about 45- and 25-fold higher turnover potential, of fdp to products, for sqs, as compared to the turnover potential of ads in flower buds and young leaves, respectively. the fraction of sqs expressed in trichome cells may channel part of available fdp into sterols and thereby lower the yield of artemisinin. zhang et al. showed that down-regulation of sqs by hairpin-rna-mediated gene silencing in a. annua resulted in a 3-fold increased artemisinin production  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the aim of our studies was to increase our understanding of terpene metabolism in the plant a. annua. the qpcr data presented in this paper demonstrate that four genes of the artemisinin biosynthetic pathway  showed remarkably higher expression  in flower buds and young leaves compared to other tissues  . these high expression levels indicate a much higher capacity to produce artemisinin precursors in flower buds and young leaves, which is partly due to the considerably higher density of trichomes on these tissues .

our aim was also to evaluate the competition for precursors, which may influence the yield of artemisinin in the plant. the expression of other sesquiterpene synthases was much lower than ads in tissues producing artemisinin precursors . consequently, their influence on artemisinin yield appear to be relatively limited and downregulation of other sesquiterpene synthase will most likely not affect artemisinin production in a. annua.

however, squalene synthesis may influence the yield of artemisinin, since the potential utilization of fdp by sqs is most likely higher than that of ads. the fact that ads is a cytosolic enzyme and sqs is localized to the er may be favorable for the sesquiterpene synthase. further, the ratio of cyp71av <dig> and dbr <dig> may be critical for the type of end product formed; high dbr <dig> activity will result in an efficient formation of dihydroartemisinic aldehyde, dihydroartemisinic acid and artemisinin while high cyp71av <dig> activity may result in artemisinic acid and arteannuin b. a direct comparison of the capacity of these two enzymes is not possible due to the fact that no kinetic data is available for cyp71av <dig>  however in this chemotype of a. annua, the turnover capacity of dbr <dig> is apparently sufficient to convert most of the artemisinic aldehyde to dihydroartemisinic aldehyde for further conversion to artemisinin. it is notable that the red <dig> activity was very low in artemisinin-producing tissues and consequently this enzyme appears not to influence the yield of the artemisinin precursor dihydroartemisinic acid to any significant extent.
