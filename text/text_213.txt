BACKGROUND
the developmental life cycle of streptomyces coelicolor belongs to the most complex among prokaryotes. after a spore has germinated and grown out into a vegetative mycelial network, multicellular developmental processes lead to both the onset of secondary metabolism and the emergence of specialised reproductive hyphae that form an aerial mycelium on the surface of colonies . the initiation of development involves both sensing of nutritional stimuli and complex extracellular signalling, including quorum sensing, extracellular proteases, and other putative signals . the formation of aerial hyphae depends on a series of mostly regulatory genes that have been designated bld since they are required for the emergence of the hairy aerial mycelium on the colony surface. the regulatory networks governed by these genes are only partially understood, but are gradually being revealed
 <cit> .

the subsequent development of the aerial hyphae into spores can be blocked at different stages by mutating critical genes. many mutations of this type give rise to a white aerial mycelium due to a failure to produce the grey spore pigment. isolation of such whi mutants was the basis for identifying central regulatory genes that direct sporulation in aerial hyphae . a major challenge in streptomyces developmental biology is now to decipher how these regulators are acting to control the physiological and cell cycle-related processes involved in producing the mature spores, including modulation of cell division, cell wall assembly, chromosome replication, and nucleoid partitioning and condensation. the accompanying physiological responses include for example the cell type-specific accumulation and utilisation of glycogen and trehalose, and the synthesis of a polyketide spore pigment. the biosynthetic genes for the pigment are found in the whie gene cluster, and the expression of this cluster depends on the regulatory whi genes, although the direct regulator is still unknown
 <cit> .

the identified regulatory whi genes that are required for the early stages of sporulation in aerial hyphae appear to fall into two major and converging pathways
 <cit> . the rna polymerase sigma factor σwhig is required for the initiation of spore formation in s. coelicolor and controls two other regulatory genes, whii encoding a response regulator and whih encoding a gntr-family protein
 <cit> . genetic analyses show that whig mutations block progression of differentiation at an early stage of apparently undifferentiated aerial hyphae in s. coelicolor, and whig mutations are epistatic on both whii and whih <cit> . the phenotypes of whii and whih mutants differ in that whii mutants do not form sporulation septa and do not show pronounced nucleoid condensation, while whih mutants are able to convert the apical cells of some aerial hyphae into spore-like fragments with condensed nucleoids and occasional sporulation septa
 <cit> . whih is autoregulatory and binds to its own promoter region
 <cit> , while whii  binds to one independent target promoter 
 <cit> . however, no other direct targets for whih or whii have been reported. a parallel pathway seems to be controlled by whia and whib. orthologues of whia are found in most gram-positive bacteria and their gene products have a bipartite structure consisting of a domain similar to a class of homing endonucleases combined with a dna-binding domain in the shape of a helix-turn-helix motif
 <cit> . s. coelicolor whia is so far reported to bind directly to its own promoter and to a sporulation-induced promoter controlling the parab genes
 <cit> . whib is the founding member of the actinomycete-specific wbl  family of fes-cluster proteins that appear to act in transcription control, although functions ascribed to wbl proteins have been controversial
 <cit> . disruption of whia or whib arrests sporulation at a very early stage, and mutant phenotypes of the two are indistinguishable
 <cit> .

the two converging pathways that depend on whig-whii/whih and whia/whib, respectively, are required for controlling most aspects of the conversion of aerial hyphae into spores. however, very few direct targets are known for these central regulatory whi genes, and overall it seems like only a small subset of genes involved in aerial hyphal sporulation have been identified. in order to find further genes that are developmentally regulated in s. coelicolor and involved in the differentiation of aerial hyphae to spores, we have carried out a dna microarray-based transcriptome analysis. the experiment was designed to identify genes that are up-regulated during development of the wild-type parent but are not up-regulated in derivative strains bearing mutations in either whia or whih, representing the two abovementioned sporulation-specific pathways. for a subset of the genes that were identified as developmentally regulated and specifically affected by whia and/or whih, we have confirmed expression patterns using real-time qrt-pcr, s <dig> nuclease mapping, and reporter gene fusions, and constructed and analysed deletion mutants. this has identified a set of previously unknown developmentally regulated promoters and sporulation genes that encode different types of regulators, a protease, an l-alanine dehydrogenase, and proteins related to spore pigment biogenesis.

RESULTS
transcriptional analysis of whia- and whih-dependent gene expression during development of s. coelicolor
a developing s. coelicolor colony is a complex mixture of cells at different developmental stages, and the sporulating aerial mycelium constitutes only a fraction of the total colony biomass. in order to identify genes that are specifically changed in sporulating aerial hyphae, we have therefore compared the pattern of gene expression in the wild-type strain m <dig> to those in two developmental mutants lacking the regulatory genes whia or whih . disruption of these genes imposes specific blocks or defects at an early stage of aerial hyphal sporulation without overtly affecting any other cell type. mycelium was harvested after  <dig>   <dig> and 48 h of growth, in the case of the wild-type strain representing colonies consisting of vegetative mycelium only, colonies covered by a developing aerial mycelium, and colonies turning grey due to abundant production of spores, respectively. rna was isolated from four independent cultures of each strain and used to generate cy3- and cy5-labelled cdna. for each time point, pairs of cy3- and cy5-labelled cdna of wild-type and one of the two mutants were co-hybridized on dna microarrays according to a balanced block design
 <cit> , with a total of four array hybridizations for each comparison . in addition to the comparisons of wild-type vs whi mutant samples, cdna of wild-type samples from  <dig> and 48 h were hybridized to the 18 h sample to reveal genes changing during development of the wild-type strain . in total, eight different class comparisons were conducted.

only considering differences in expression with a benjamini-hochberg corrected p-value <  <dig>  as significant
 <cit> , we found a total of  <dig> genes differentially expressed in at least one of the  <dig> class comparisons analyzed .  <dig> of them  had significantly different levels of transcription in at least one time point of the whia or whih mutant compared to the wild-type, and the following discussion concerns these  <dig> genes only. most of the significant effects of the whia and whih mutations could be seen at the latest time point, and no gene with significant change of expression between mutant and the parent was detected at 18 h. this is consistent with our initial assumption that whia and whih specifically affect gene expression in sporulating aerial mycelium. only a few genes were significantly affected by whia or whih disruption at 36 h, including seven in the whia and six in the whih strain. at 48 h,  <dig> genes were changed significantly in the whia strain compared to the parent , while only  <dig> where changed in the whih mutant . the change in expression level among the  <dig> differentially expressed genes ranged from + <dig>  to + <dig>  fold for the genes overexpressed in the mutants as compared to the wild type, and - <dig>  to - <dig>  fold for the under-expressed ones.  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes showed more than  <dig> fold change of the expression level. of the  <dig> genes that were affected by whi mutations,  <dig> were previously known to be involved in the differentiation processes or to be closely related to such genes .

both hierarchical clustering of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes according to their expression profiles  and grouping in a venn diagram  indicated four dominant patterns. genes with increased expression in a mutant compared to wild-type parent fell into two distinct subgroups at 48 h, showing overexpression only in the whia or the whih mutant, respectively. only one gene was significantly overexpressed in both mutants . among the genes with down-regulated expression in at least one mutant, the majority showed increased expression during development of the wild-type strain, further supporting the notion that these genes are related to the sporulation process. two main subgroups were recognised, with one being affected by both whia and whih, and the other only affected by whia . figure 
 <dig> indicates three genes that may specifically depend on whih for developmental up-regulation, but closer examination of the data showed that all three  have decreased expression in the whia mutant also, albeit with a benjamini-hochberg corrected p-value > <dig>  . thus, all of the genes that were down-regulated in the whih strain appeared to be also down-regulated in the whia mutant, while another group only depended on whia and not whih. this is consistent with whia mutations giving a more complete block of sporulation than whih mutations
 <cit> , and it suggests that there may be very few genes that specifically depend on whih for expression.

to further verify the microarray data, we have used qrt-pcr to test expression of  <dig> genes with decreased expression in one or both mutants . this overall expression pattern was confirmed for several genes, with eleven out of the  <dig> tested genes showing a significantly lower expression in the whia mutant compared to the wildtype at at least one of the two sporulation time points 36 h and 48 h . thus, a large fraction of this group are developmentally regulated genes correctly identified by the array analysis. further investigations of several of these genes are described in the following sections.

for the genes that appeared overexpressed in the whih mutant, i.e. that were putative candidates for being repressed by whih, six genes were tested by qrt-pcr. five appeared to be false positives and only one had its microarray expression profile confirmed by qrt-pcr experiments . this is the previously described gene eshb  encoding a putative cyclic nucleotide-binding protein
 <cit> . the qrt-pcr indicated higher eshb expression during development of the whih mutant compared to the parent strain. in an s <dig> nuclease protection assay , the eshb promoter was found to be similarly up-regulated during development in both the parent and the whih mutant, and the level of transcript was only  <dig> -fold higher in the mutant at the 36 h time point and not different from wildtype at 48 h . also the eshb paralogoue esha 
 <cit>  was significantly up-regulated in the whih mutant according to the arrays , but s <dig> nuclease protection assays showed that esha is strongly up-regulated during developmental in both strains, with only subtle difference in mrna level between the whih mutant and the wild-type . overall, our analyses did not reveal any clear candidates for repression by the whih transcription factor.

analysis of expression and mutant phenotypes of new sporulation genes
we have specifically investigated seven potential sporulation loci emerging from the microarray analysis . expression of these loci has been monitored using qrt-pcr , s <dig> nuclease mapping , and promoter fusions to a reporter gene encoding the fluorescent protein mcherry . for the latter experiments, we constructed a new vector, pkf <dig>  used this to construct “promoter probe” fusions, and introduced them into streptomyces strains . furthermore, deletion mutants have been constructed for these seven loci and examined to detect phenotypes associated with sporulation and maturation of spores. the tested features were colony appearance and pigmentation on ms agar; appearance of aerial hyphae and spores in phase-contrast microscopy; and heat resistance of spores. one additional sporulation-induced locus that was discovered through this study has already been reported, namely hups  encoding a nucleoid-associated hu-like protein that influences nucleoid structure and spore maturation
 <cit> .

sco7449- <dig> – a gene cluster with relation to spore pigmentation
among the genes showing the largest difference in expression between whi mutants and parent was sco <dig>  which encodes a predicted membrane protein of unknown function. the qrt-pcr analysis confirmed the strong up-regulation of sco <dig> during sporulation and showed a strict dependence of this up-regulation on both whia and whih . the transcriptional reporter gene construct showed expression specifically in sporulating hyphae . we noted that also the two adjacent genes sco <dig> and sco <dig>  were significantly up-regulated during development of the wild-type strain . these two genes also showed a tendency to be down-regulated in the two whi mutants, although this difference was not statistically significant. we consider it likely that the three genes sco7449- <dig> are co-transcribed. to test whether this group of genes has any function during sporulation, the whole putative operon sco7449- <dig> was deleted and replaced by an apramycin resistance cassette . we did not detect any phenotypic effect of the disruption in relation to growth, efficiency of aerial mycelium and spore formation, or shape and stress tolerance of the spores . however, colonies of the disruption mutant showed a more brownish pigmentation on ms agar compared to the grey appearance of the parent strain, and this change of pigment colour in the mutant could be complemented by the sco7449- <dig> genes integrated at the ϕc <dig> attb site of the s. coelicolor genome .

sco <dig> encodes a predicted sortase of subgroup e
 <cit> , and the sco <dig> gene product shows similarity to proteins associated with polyketide biosynthesis, particularly the s. coelicolor whie orfi  product involved in spore pigment biosynthesis, with which it shares 53% identity over  <dig> amino acids
 <cit> . it has been suggested that whie orfi is involved in retaining or targeting the pigment to the spore, possibly within its wall
 <cit> . comparison of the whie and sco7449- <dig> regions of the s. coelicolor strain m <dig> genome to the corresponding sections of three other sequenced streptomycete genomes  further supports a link between these two gene clusters and indicates a functional relationship of sco <dig> to spore pigment biosynthesis. the closest homologues of sco <dig> and its two neighboring genes sco <dig>  and sco <dig>  are all found within the whie gene cluster in the other mentioned genomes, with sco <dig> being most similar to the gene at the position corresponding to whie orfi , and the orthologues of sco <dig> and sco <dig> being located immediately adjacent to the final gene in the spore pigment operon sppe . in summary, the altered pigmentation of developing colonies of the Δsco7449- <dig> mutant, the clear-cut up-regulation of these genes during sporulation, and the linkage of sco <dig> and adjacent genes to orthologues of the whie gene cluster, lead us to propose an involvement of one or more of the sco7449- <dig> genes in maturation of spores and processing of the spore pigment.

sco1774- <dig> – encoding an afsr-related protein and an l-alanine dehydrogenase
both genes sco <dig> and sco <dig> showed a whia-dependent expression according to the microarray data . these genes form a putative transcriptional unit, with sco <dig> encoding a protein with partial similarity to the afsr regulatory protein
 <cit>  and sco <dig> encoding a predicted l-alanine dehydrogenase. the qrt-pcr analyses confirmed the developmental up-regulation of sco <dig> and that this is dependent on whia . expression was up-regulated during development of the whih mutant, but with delay and to a lower level than in the parent strain. the presence of a sporulation-induced promoter for sco <dig>  which we here refer to as p <dig>  was confirmed by the reporter gene assays, which showed high activity in developing spores . s <dig> nuclease protection assays of sco <dig> identified a putative transcription start site around  <dig> base pairs upstream of the predicted gtg start codon . this is preceded by an appropriately located - <dig> promoter motif , but no corresponding - <dig> motif could be recognised.

sco <dig> showed a completely different pattern of expression compared to sco <dig>  with apparently constitutive presence of the transcript in the wild-type strain, but in agreement with the microarray data, there was a lower level of sco <dig> transcript in the whia mutant at the  <dig> and 48 h timepoints compared to the parent strain . to clarify the basis for the differential expression between sco <dig> and sco <dig>  the transcripts in this region were investigated using rt-pcr and primer pairs specific to intragenic and intergenic regions of sco <dig> and sco <dig> . transcripts containing the intragenic region of sco <dig> were abundant, while no transcripts containing the intergenic region between sco <dig> and sco <dig> were detected during vegetative growth , suggesting that there is a specific promoter for sco <dig> that is active during vegetative growth. a promoter probe construct carrying parts of the upstream region of sco <dig> failed to detect any activity during vegetative growth or sporulation , but this construct included only  <dig> base pairs upstream of sco <dig> and the promoter may require additional upstream sequences. during sporulation, transcription from the whia-dependent p <dig> promoter contributes to the expression of sco <dig>  as deduced from the presence of transcripts containing the intergenic region between sco <dig> and sco <dig> . this dependence on the p <dig> promoter provides a likely explanation of the poor expression of sco <dig> in the whia mutant .

deletion of both sco1774- <dig>  or sco <dig> only  affected sporulation and resulted in both a reduced spore pigmentation and reduced heat resistance of spores . a fragment carrying sco1775- <dig> including 240 bp upstream of sco <dig>  led to partial restoration of the phenotype . after complementation with cosmid i <dig>  harboring a larger genomic region around sco1774- <dig>  both deletion strains produced the grey spore pigment to the same level as m <dig> . it is not clear why the shorter dna fragments did not lead to full complementation of the mutants. possibly, even though there is a strongly predicted stem-loop structure immediately after sco <dig> that may serve a transcriptional terminator, polarity on the downstream gene sco <dig> may contribute to the mutant phenotype of the insertions/deletions in sco1774- <dig> 

interestingly, l-alanine dehydrogenase has previously been implicated in development of both bacillus subtilis and myxococcus xanthus. insertions in the ald gene in b. subtilis strongly reduced the efficiency of sporulation
 <cit> . it was speculated that this may be due to a role of alanine dehydrogenase in deaminating the alanine derived from protein turnover and producing pyruvate that can be used for energy metabolism. this was supported by the partial suppression of the ald sporulation phenotype by enriching the medium with pyruvate. the up-regulation of ald transcription during sporulation seemed not to be directly controlled by tested developmental regulators and may be affected by substrate availability or other signals
 <cit> . mutation of alda in m. xanthus negatively influenced development, causing delayed aggregation and reduced numbers and viability of spores
 <cit> . the basis for this is unclear, and the required function of alanine dehydrogenase during development appeared not to be production of pyruvate. in similarity to m. xanthus alda, the sco <dig> mutant phenotype was not affected by enrichment of the medium with pyruvate . nevertheless, the sco <dig> alanine dehydrogenase is required for maturation of spores in s. coelicolor and its expression during sporulation is at least partially achieved by the whia-dependent promoter p <dig> 

the sco <dig> gene product shows an interesting similarity to the sarp-type transcription factor afsr, but it lacks the sarp domain, which is the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids of afsr that includes a winged helix motif and a bacterial transcriptional activation domain
 <cit> . thus, sco <dig> is not likely to encode a transcription factor, and the gene product shows similarity only to the c-terminal parts of afsr with a tetratricopeptide repeat indicating involvement in protein-protein interactions, and an nb-arc atpase domain
 <cit> . in summary, sco <dig> shows a clear-cut developmental transcriptional regulation that is dependent on whia, but the biological function remains unclear.

sco <dig> – encoding a homologue of nosiheptide resistance regulator
sco <dig> encodes a close homologue of the nosiheptide resistance regulatory protein nsha from streptomyces actuosus with  <dig> % identity over the entire sequence of  <dig> amino acids
 <cit> . orthologues of sco <dig> are conserved among several streptomycete genomes, including organisms that like s. coelicolor are not resistant to thiopeptide antibiotics like nosiheptide and thiostrepton and do not carry a homologue of the nshr resistance gene that is linked to nsha in s. actuosus. this suggests alternative functions for sco <dig> than control of thiopeptide resistance. the sco <dig> gene showed a clear developmental up-regulation in the wild-type parent, and this was dependent on both whia and whih . the mcherry reporter assays showed a high level of expression in sporulating aerial hyphae, but not in vegetative hyphae . finally, although a sco <dig> deletion mutant produced normal-looking colonies on ms agar , we detected a reduced heat-resistance of the mutant spores compared to the parent strain . these observations identify sco <dig> as a sporulation gene with a role in maturation of spores.

other developmentally regulated loci
the sco <dig> gene encodes a tetr family regulator and is located close to afsk , which encodes a ser/thr protein kinase involved in apical growth and branching of hyphae, as well as in control of secondary metabolism
 <cit> . sco <dig> showed statistically significant up-regulation in the parent strain m <dig> and decreased expression in the whia mutant in the array data . the developmental regulation was not tested by qrt-pcr, but was confirmed by the mcherry reporter construct that showed clear signal in spore chains but not in vegetative hyphae . we did not detect any phenotype associated with the sco <dig> deletion mutant , and its function during sporulation therefore remains unclear.

sco <dig> encodes a putative trypsin-like serine protease. the developmental up-regulation and the decreased expression in both whia and whih mutants was confirmed by s <dig> nuclease protection assays . the assays pinpointed a 5′-end for sco <dig> transcripts that overlaps with the predicted translational start, and this signal was strongly increased during development of strain m <dig>  but was much weaker in the whia mutant. a delayed up-regulation was seen in the whih strain . further, there is contribution from promoters located upstream of the probe used in these assays, possibly from the sco <dig> gene. the mcherry reporter gene assays for sco <dig> showed a low but significant signal in developing spores , further supporting that sco <dig> is expressed during sporulation. the discovery of a protease that is expressed during sporulation is interesting in relation to the known involvement of extracellular proteases and protease inhibitors in controlling development of s. coelicolor and other streptomycetes
 <cit> . however, no phenotype was detected in the sco <dig> deletion mutant, and the absence of unequivocal secretion signals in the amino acid sequence makes the role of the sco <dig> protease in such extracellular signalling unclear.

the microarray analyses showed significant changes of expression for sco <dig>  with decreased levels of transcripts in both mutants . the developmental up-regulation in the wild-type strain and the lower transcript levels in the mutants were confirmed by qrt-pcr, although there was a limited up-regulation of this gene in the whi mutants. a low but significant signal was detected in spores from the sco <dig> promoter probe construct, but no phenotype was revealed in the sco <dig> deletion mutant . thus, it remains unclear whether there is a sporulation-related role for this gene, which encodes a predicted membrane protein of unknown function.

sco <dig> encodes a small predicted membrane protein with similarity to the previously described smea protein that is produced during sporulation of s. coelicolor <cit> . smea is required for the targeting of sffa, a protein with similarity to the spoiiie/ftsk family of dna transporters, to sporulation septa, and several of the smea homologues in streptomycetes are encoded together with members of this protein family
 <cit> . this is not the case for sco <dig>  which instead may be co-transcribed with sco <dig>  encoding a known substrate for secretion via the tat pathway but of unknown function
 <cit> . the results on sco <dig> expression were similar to those of sco <dig>  with significant developmental up-regulation in the parent strain, lower expression in the whia strain detected in the array experiments , and confirmation of this by real-time qrt-pcr . a sco1195- <dig> deletion mutant failed to reveal any obvious phenotype.

CONCLUSIONS
the aerial hyphal sporulation in s. coelicolor occurs only in a fraction of the colony biomass and is not highly synchronized. thus, even if a gene is strongly induced at a specific stage of sporulation, it is highly challenging to detect this change in global transcriptome investigations of total rna extracted from the complex mixtures of cell-types that constitute a developing streptomyces colony. we show here that by comparing a wild-type to mutants lacking key regulators that specifically act in processes linked to aerial hypha, it is possible to identify previously unknown genes that are up-regulated in sporulating aerial hyphae. these genes are not necessarily direct targets for transcriptional regulation by the whia or whih proteins. in fact, there is no clear ovelap between the set of genes identified here and the very recently described direct targets of whia in streptomyces venezuelae <cit> . nevertheless, our approach allowed identification of several new genes that are important for sporulation in s. coelicolor. some of the developmentally regulated genes that were found by this transcriptome analysis have been investigated here and in a previous study
 <cit> , and the function and regulation of others remain now to be investigated in detail.
