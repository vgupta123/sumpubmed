BACKGROUND

sporobolus stapfianus belongs to one of the largest and most ubiquitous families of angiosperms, the poaceae, which includes some of the most important crop and forage species. despite their global distribution, species in this family are generally sensitive to water deficit, and most individuals die when leaf water potentials fall below - <dig> mpa  <cit> . however, some species within the family , have evolved the ability to survive desiccation or the equilibration of the water potential in their vegetative tissues to that of the surrounding air  of 50% at  <dig> oc). the roots and shoots of these species can, like seeds, remain in the dried state for considerable periods of time and when rehydrated can recover and continue growth: hence the name resurrection plants  <cit> .

desiccation tolerance  developed early in the evolution of the land plants and is believed essential for the transition to dry land from fresh water  <cit> . vegetative dt was lost from the core lineage of the land plant phylogeny following the evolution of tracheophytes, but evolved in  <dig> lineages  <cit>  within the angiosperms. in all cases investigated thus far, vegetative dt seems to have occurred by a change from developmental to environmental induction in the control networks associated with orthodox seed dt mechanisms  <cit> . similarities between aspects of dehydration-inducible gene expression profiles associated with vegetative dt in resurrection angiosperms and the gene expression patterns related to developmentally determined dehydration and onset of quiescence in orthodox seeds during maturation support this hypothesis  <cit>  .

over the last few decades, much attention has been given to understanding the response of resurrection angiosperms to dehydration and rehydration in order to decipher the mechanistic aspects of vegetative dt  <cit> . several resurrection angiosperms, primarily eudicots, have been investigated and a great deal of transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic information has been obtained  <cit> . however, from both an evolutionary and a human societal perspective, as several major crops are monocots and employ c <dig> photosynthesis, understanding how resurrection monocots respond to the dehydration of their vegetative tissues is critically important.

the resurrection grass, sporobolus stapfianus gandoger, a member of a group of forage grasses  <cit>  has long served as the monocot model resurrection species  <cit> . s. stapfianus has both younger desiccation tolerant  and older desiccation sensitive  leaves that grow on the same plant  <cit> . the younger dt leaves are ds if excised from the parent plant before dehydration  <cit> . s. stapfianus is easily propagated either via seed or clonally via tillers. s. stapfianus is also a sister species to several grasses  <cit>  that are ds, including s. pyramidalis , which allows for a sister-group contrast that highlights evolutionary recent changes in function. such a sister-group contrast strategy was used successfully to investigate adaptive metabolite signatures and phenotypes associated with dehydration by comparing the two species as they dehydrated to 60% rwc  <cit> . the sister-group contrast revealed some important aspects of the metabolic preparation for dehydration and the ability to respond during the initial phases of water loss that are important for the dt phenotype of s. stapfianus. however, it is the response to dehydration beyond 60% rwc that revealed the metabolic aspects of dt per se.

as s. stapfianus desiccates to less than 20% rwc, a complex metabolic re-programing that leads to dt is initiated and established  <cit> . this response is comprised of cellular protection components coupled with remobilization and retention of important nutrients, particularly nitrogen from senescing older leaves that are sensitive to desiccation. the metabolic regulation that occurs during desiccation also involved a significant investment in protection from oxidative stress  via glutathione, lipid-soluble antioxidants, and perhaps through the accumulation of gamma-glutamyl dipeptides. dt also required a large investment of carbon in the form of soluble sugars to protect cellular integrity and infrastructure as the cells dry.

in the present study, we extended our investigations into the complexity of dt by integrating a leaf transcriptomic analysis with both new metabolomics data assessing the metabolic aspects of the initiation of leaf metabolism during rehydration coupled with our previous metabolic assessments of leaf metabolism during desiccation  <cit> . the aim was to develop an understanding of how gene expression and metabolite profiles can be linked to generate a more detailed mechanistic model of the ways plant cells respond to dehydration, prepare for desiccation, and recover when rehydrated. to achieve this aim we combined a nimblegen™ array approach with global metabolite profiling technologies to detail the response of the young dt leaves of s. stapfianus to a drying-rehydration event.

RESULTS
the leaf rehydration metabolome
the results of global unbiased metabolic profiling of rehydrating dried dt young leaves of s. stapfianus, derived from the identical samples reported for the dehydration metabolome  <cit> , are presented in additional file 1: table s <dig>  in total,  <dig> different metabolites of known chemical structures were identified in the young leaf tissues,  <dig> of which exhibited a statistically significant alteration  in abundance in one or more of the dehydration and/or rehydration treatments. the metabolite profiles of the young leaves during the dehydration process is represented as the ratio of the abundance of each metabolite in the dried state to its abundance in the hydrated state  of identified metabolites as plants approached the dried state. the rehydration metabolome was assessed by comparing the abundance of individual metabolites at  <dig> h and  <dig> h of rehydration to their abundances in both the desiccated and hydrated  states . in general, the trends of the changes in abundance of many metabolites reflected the return to fully hydrated metabolic state. this included metabolites that exhibited elevated abundance during desiccation and reduced abundance relative to the dried state and continued to decline to normal levels during extended rehydration. other metabolites decreased in abundance during desiccation and increased in abundance towards normal levels upon rehydration. however,  <dig> metabolites did not follow these general trends: either their abundance remained elevated or increased further during rehydration , or became depleted or remained depleted  during rehydration. the changes in abundance of these  <dig> metabolites likely highlighted processes important to the rehydration response of recovering leaf tissues .table  <dig> metabolic response of young leaf tissues of s. stapfianus during rehydration from the desiccated state. values are fold change  in metabolite abundance between desiccated  and initial hydration  or between rehydration times of  <dig> h  or  <dig> h  and either dry or initial hydration

cells with values in bold indicate statistically higher levels of a metabolite  in rehydrating leaf tissue compared to either the level of the metabolite in desiccated leaf tissue or the hydrated control leaf tissue. cells with values in italics indicate lower levels of a metabolite with  in rehydrating leaf tissue compared to either the level of the metabolite in desiccated leaf tissue or the hydrated control leaf tissue. in the dry/hyd column the red and green shading indicates significantly  higher and lower levels respectively of a metabolite in the desiccated leaf tissue compared to the hydrated control leaf tissue. cells without values do not indicate a lack of measurement but rather they indicate that the difference in abundance between the two tissues in the comparison is not statistically significant 




eleven of the  <dig> metabolites that were elevated during rehydration actually increased in abundance as rehydration progressed, while the remaining  <dig> remained at the same elevated level reached during dehydration and did not return to normal levels. of these  <dig> elevated metabolites five were amino acids or their derivatives , three were carbohydrates , two were lipids , and one was classified in the cofactors, prosthetic groups, electron carriers category . the majority of the  <dig> metabolites that remained elevated during the rehydration period also represented these four major groups: amino acids and derivatives, carbohydrates, lipids, and cofactors, prosthetic groups, electron carriers.

rehydration resulted in the reduced relative abundance of  <dig> metabolites  and the maintenance of levels already reduced as a result of desiccation of  <dig> other metabolites during the first  <dig> h of the rehydration treatment. the majority of the metabolites that decline or continued to decline upon rehydration belonged to either nucleotide or lipid metabolism pathways. metabolites associated with purine and pyrimidine metabolism included 2’-deoxyadenosine, 2’-deoxyguanosine, adenosine, adenosine-2’,3’-cyclic monophosphate, allantoin, guanosine-3’,5'-cyclic monophosphate , 2’-deoxycytidine, cytidine, cytidine 2’,3’-cyclic monophosphate, and thymidine. those involved in lipid metabolism included malonate, 2-hydroxypalmitate, margarate, palmitate, glycerol 2-phosphate, glycerol 3-phosphate, glycerophosphorylcholine , and two products of lipid peroxidation 9-hydroxy- <dig>  12-octadecadienoic acid  and 13-hydroxy- <dig> -octadecadienoic acid . several lipids  also remained low as compared to their levels in the desiccated state and hydrated controls.

other metabolites that remained depleted upon rehydration included dehydroascorbate, n6-acetyllysine, glutamine-leucine, stachydrine, 5-methyl-2’-deoxycytidine, riboflavin , and oxaloacetate. notably, inorganic phosphate levels decreased significantly during the first  <dig> h of rehydration.

the transcriptome of dehydration and rehydration
rna samples extracted from hydrated, dehydrated, desiccated, or rehydrated leaf tissues of s. stapfianus were pooled and used to generate a catalog of  <dig>  ests by  <dig> parallel sequencing . after removal of low-quality reads,  <dig>   ests were retained of which  <dig>  could be assembled into  <dig>  contigs. assembled reads ranged from single reads of  <dig> bp to contigs up to  <dig>  bp in length, with an overall average contig length of  <dig> bp. sequence analysis using blastx against the ncbi non-redundant protein database showed that out of the  <dig>  assembled contigs,  <dig>   contigs predicted protein sequences that bore homology to one or more known proteins. the majority of these contigs,  <dig>  , showed predicted protein sequence similarity to those encoded by known plant genes and all matched sequences within the grass databases. the order of contig representation frequency was setaria italica > oryza sativa > sorghum bicolor > zea mays as the order of contig representation frequency. gene ontology  classification terms could be reliably assigned to  <dig>  of the  <dig>  ests that generated positively identified in blastx analysis. go term enrichment analysis  indicated that the est collection, as a representative sample of the transcriptome, broadly represented all of the major go classification categories. comparison of conceptual translations to entries in the tigrfam, superfam, pfam, and prints databases by interproscan identified  <dig>  contigs that matched one or more domain or motif signatures . within this group,  <dig> contigs had one or more pathway/reaction components that could be mapped to one or more pathway or reaction components at kegg, unipathway, metacyc, or reactome categories . this analysis revealed a broad representation of pathways including purine and pyridine metabolism , photosynthesis-related pathways , carbohydrate metabolism, membrane transport pathways, energy metabolism, redox homeostasis, and amino acid or protein synthetic pathways.table  <dig> a summary of the  <dig> life science  sequencing analysis of the cdna derived from pooled rna isolated from leaf tissues subjected to different levels of dehydration and rehydration of young leaves of s. stapfianus





identification of transcripts that increase or decline in abundance in response to dehydration or rehydration of young s. stapfianus leaves
the transcript expression profiles of hydrated unstressed young dt leaves of s. stapfianus  at 96% relative water contents  were compared with those of young leaves from plants dehydrated to 80%, 60%, 40%, 30% rwc, and desiccated  at 11%rwc and at two time points after rehydration of dried plants . all quoted rwc values vary between +/- 2%. all plants were grown under greenhouse conditions and harvested at the same time of day to ensure that natural circadian rhythms in transcript abundance were not confounders in the analyses. after quality control and normalization, log-transformed expression values were subjected to an anova to determine those transcripts, represented by the corresponding probe sets, that were differentially expressed across the various levels of hydration and times following rehydration. a false discovery rate  correction for multiple-comparisons was applied to the p-values of the anova to reduce the likelihood of false positives. transcripts were designated as statistically significantly differentially abundant transcripts  if they exhibited a statistically significant change in transcript abundance during either dehydration or rehydration. a total of  <dig>  transcripts were designated as sdats, each exhibiting a statistically significant differential abundance in at least one of the treatments . a tukey’s  post-hoc test was performed on these  <dig>  transcripts to determine under which comparison of specific treatments each was differentially expressed . of the  <dig>  transcripts with annotation, all were differentially abundant in the dehydration series , and  <dig> were differentially abundant in the rehydration series . biological network gene ontology  analysis of gene ontology  terms of the annotated sdats showed that contigs related to ‘response to stimulus’ were the most highly enriched followed by ‘transcription’, ‘photosynthesis’, and ‘transport’. sdats in several subcategories of ‘response to stimulus’ were also highly enriched, including ‘response to abiotic stimulus’, ‘response to endogenous stimulus’, ‘response to chemical stimulus’, and ‘response to general stress’ .fig.  <dig> gene ontology  terms associated with significantly differentially abundant transcripts  surveyed during the dehydration of young leaf tissues of s. stapfianus. biological network gene ontology  was used to determine biological process terms in the full go terms  or the go slim plant terms  that were enriched . node size represents the number of genes within the node and the color filling represents the p-value , the darker the shade the lower the p value




for most transcripts that significantly increased in abundance during dehydration, the peak of transcript abundance occurred when leaves reached approximately 30% rwc . this is also the water content at which transcripts that decline in response to dehydration reached maximum depletion. the  <dig> sdats that exhibited the greatest positive fold change in abundance from leaves at 30% rwc are presented in additional file 5: table s5a. about 50% of these sdats were annotated as lea proteins with elips, 1-cys peroxiredoxin, and aldose reductase also exhibiting predominance. of the  <dig> sdats that exhibited the most negative fold change in abundance ,  <dig> were annotated as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase , the major carboxylase in c <dig> photosynthesis, with the remaining transcripts encoding enzymes involved in photosynthesis  activase) and energy metabolism .

transcript accumulation for sdats that represent transcripts that increase in abundance in response to rehydration tended to peak in the first  <dig> h following the addition of water to the dried s. stapfianus leaves. the  <dig> transcripts that exhibit the greatest fold change at the  <dig> h rehydration time point  were not dominated by any particular class, but did exhibit some enrichment for transcripts involved in protein synthesis , membrane transport proteins , and membrane atpases. the sdats that exhibited the greatest reduction in abundance were maximally depleted within the first  <dig> h of rehydration  and their profiles mirrored those that were most abundant in the 30% rwc leaf samples, which were dominated by lea, elip, and 1-cys peroxiredoxin transcripts.

functional group analysis of differentially expressed transcripts
we concentrated on a number of specific functional groups associated with dehydration and desiccation tolerance to gain a better understanding of the complex transcriptome responses of s. stapfianus leaves to dehydration and rehydration. we looked for linkages to cellular protection strategies and alterations in the metabolic state alterations observed previously during dehydration  <cit>  or rehydration .

antioxidants and their related enzymes
the majority of the sdats that represent transcripts of genes involved in antioxidant biosynthesis pathways, reactive oxygen species  protection pathways, and redox homeostasis increased in abundance during dehydration . the transcripts that exhibited the highest positive fold change in abundance were the 1-cys peroxiredoxin contigs ), which were significantly elevated in the early phases of dehydration  and reached a  <dig> -fold increase at 30% rwc . the abundances of several superoxide dismutase  transcripts also increased significantly at early stages of dehydration and peaked in abundance at 30% rwc along with transcripts for alcohol dehydrogenase , cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase , and chloroplastic glutathione reductase  transcripts. abundances of all of these transcripts decreased during rehydration, but did not fall to the levels seen in the hydrated controls. several transcripts varied in transcript abundance to only a limited extent during drying, but were substantially elevated during rehydration. these included transcripts encoding catalase , alcohol dehydrogenase , phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase , redoxin , chloroplastic thioredoxin-like 3- <dig> protein , apx1-cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase , and l-ascorbate peroxidase .fig.  <dig> a heat map of sdats encoding redox homeostasis related transcripts young leaf tissues of s. stapfianus. multi experiment viewer  was used to generate the clustering of the data based on fold change values . the columns represents the ratio between dehydrated  as well as the dry state  and the hydrated state  for the first  <dig> columns and between either  <dig> and  <dig> h rehydration and the dry state  or initial hydrated states . red shading indicates a positive value for the fold change and green shading indicates negative values for the fold change in transcript abundance. black indicates no change in transcript abundance




several transcripts encoding glutathione s-transferase, an ascorbate peroxidase , chloroplastic thioredoxin , and a tocopherol o-methyltransferase  were significantly depleted during dehydration with the maximal depletion occurring at 30% rwc, or in the desiccated state. all of these transcripts accumulated during rehydration, but did not reach the levels seen in hydrated controls, with the exception of the tocopherol o-methyltransferase.

carbohydrates and energy metabolism
sdats associated with carbohydrate metabolism, including those involved directly in energy production and photosynthesis comprised the largest of all functional groups that responded during the dehydration of sporobolus leaf tissues . some sdats responding positively by an increase in abundance during dehydration encoded enzymes generally associated with carbohydrates involved in osmoprotection and glass formation during dehydration . the sdats, which exhibited the greatest fold-increase, were those annotated as aldose reductase , galactinol synthase , and glucose and ribitol dehydrogenase  and were between 3- and 5-fold more abundant at 30% rwc than those seen in the hydrated controls. sdats encoding beta-amylase , sucrose synthase , galactinol synthase , raffinose synthase , and stachyose synthase , which are associated with the synthesis of the raffinose-family oligosaccharides , as well as sucrose, also showed peak abundance at 30% rwc. along with sdats associated with the synthesis of important carbohydrates involved in dehydration tolerance, transcripts for hexose transporters , a glycerol-3-phosphate permease/transporter , and a sugar transporter type 2a  were also significantly elevated during dehydration. all of the sdats that exhibited dehydration induced significant increases in abundance in this category decreased in abundance during rehydration, but were still more abundant at  <dig> h than in the hydrated controls.fig.  <dig> a heat map of sdats encoding energy metabolism related transcripts young leaf tissues of s. stapfianus. multi experiment viewer  was used to generate the clustering of the data based on fold change values . the color code represents the ratio between dehydrated  as well as the dry state  and the hydrated state  for the first  <dig> columns and between either  <dig> and  <dig> h rehydration and the dry state  or initial hydrated states . red shading indicates a positive value for the fold change and green shading indicates negative values for the fold change in transcript abundance. black indicates no change in transcript abundance




several sdats encoding glycolytic and the tca cycle enzymes significantly increased in abundance during dehydration. transcripts encoding the glycolytic enzymes transketolase , 6-phosphofructokinase , phosphoglycerate mutase , hexokinase , and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase  all increased in abundance as dehydration reached 60% rwc and peaked at 30% rwc. of the several sdats that were annotated as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase only one, contig  <dig>  exhibited an elevation in abundance at 30% rwc. in all other samples, this sdat was depleted in comparison to the hydrated control. in contrast, the eight other sdats that annotated as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were substantially depleted during all phases of dehydration. the sdats encoding glycolytic enzymes that exhibited an increase in abundance during dehydration decreased upon rehydration, but had still not attained control levels of abundance at  <dig> h. sdats that encode enzymes of the tca cycle , succinate dehydrogenase , isocitrate dehydrogenase , and aconitate hydratase  followed a similar pattern of change in abundance during dehydration and rehydration.

sdats encoding proteins associated with photosynthesis and carbon fixation were almost exclusively depleted during dehydration. depletion initiated when the plants had reached 80% rwc, intensified as dehydration reached between 40% and 30% rwc, and reached a maximum depletion as desiccation ensued  . twenty-nine sdats annotated as pepc registered significant decreases in transcript abundance  and were the most strongly affected of the  <dig> sdats that exhibited the greatest decrease in abundance during dehydration. a similar number of sdats annotated as chlorophyll a/b-binding protein transcripts were also among the most strongly affected of this aforementioned group of  <dig> sdats . transcripts encoding carbonic anhydrase , fructose  <dig> -bisphosphate aldolase , fructose  <dig> -bisphosphatase , and the chloroplastic form of phosphoglycerate kinase  along with transcripts encoding protein components of photosystems i and ii, such as photosystem i reaction center proteins , photosystem ii reaction center proteins  and ferredoxin  all significantly declined in abundance during dehydration.

the abundances of all of the sdats in this category that had decreased during dehydration increased during rehydration, but after  <dig> h were still at lower abundance than in the hydrated controls.

cell wall metabolism
a total of  <dig> sdats were annotated as encoding enzymes involved in cell wall-associated metabolism . transcripts encoding enzymes involved in cell wall remodeling were among the sdats that increased in abundance during dehydration and peaked in abundance late in dehydration when the leaves reached 30% rwc or were desiccated . this group of sdats represented genes encoding the cell wall loosening enzyme endo-beta-mannanase  and the hydrolase beta-mannan endohydrolase . also in this group were transcripts encoding beta-d-glucan exohydrolase , glucan endo- <dig> -beta-glucosidase , feruloyl esterase , and glycosyltransferases . one set of sdats encoding cell wall-associated hydrolases was clearly associated with the very early stages of dehydration and only showed increased abundance in the 80% rwc samples . at sampling times representing more advanced dehydration, these transcripts either decreased slightly or remained close to the levels in the hydrated control. upon rehydration, the abundances of most of the transcripts that had accumulated during dehydration, including those encoding cell wall-associated hydrolases, increased further and remained at levels above those of the hydrated controls.

ten sdats, which decreased in abundance during leaf dehydration, were annotated as cellulose synthase, a cell wall biosynthesis enzyme . other prominent sdats that exhibited significant decreases in abundance during dehydration included lichenase , glucan endo- <dig> -beta-glucosidase , and anthocyanidin  <dig> -o-glucosyltransferase .

the majority of transcripts that were depleted during dehydration increased in transcript abundance upon rehydration, but did not reach the hydrated control levels within  <dig> h.

signaling-associated transcripts
a total of  <dig> sdats encoding proteins associated with signaling kinase/phosphatase cascades, and of these,  <dig> increased and  <dig> decreased in abundance during dehydration . several of the sdats that exhibited the greatest increase in abundance during dehydration started to accumulate early in the dehydration treatment at 80% rwc and peaked when dehydration reached 30% rwc. among the sdats that showed the greatest change in abundance were eight protein phosphatase 2c proteins , an abscisic acid-inducible protein kinase-like isoform  <dig> , salt-inducible protein kinases , snf1-related protein kinase regulatory subunit gamma-1-like proteins , a calcineurin b-like -interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase  <dig> , map kinase  <dig> , a map kinase kinases , and an at5g01020-like serine/threonine-protein kinase . several transcripts in this category, which accumulated later in the dehydration treatment at 60% rwc included two aarf domain-containing protein kinases  and a casein kinase , were then depleted as the leaves desiccated. three cbl-interacting protein kinase  <dig> transcripts , a cipk-like protein  <dig> transcript , and a map kinase  <dig> transcript  all significantly increased in abundance only in the 30% rwc sample.

some contigs represented both sdats that increased in abundance and those that decreased in abundance during dehydration. presumably, these sdats are either derived from specific members of individual gene families or different spicing events. these sdats included those encoding protein phosphatase 2c proteins: the contigs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> showed increased abundance during dehydration and contigs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> showed decreased abundance during dehydration. sdats encoding cbl-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase  <dig>  also decreased in abundance during dehydration.

in addition to those mentioned previously, the signaling-associated transcripts that decreased in response to dehydration encoded predominantly receptor-like protein kinases , various serine-threonine protein kinases , and several leucine-rich repeat  receptor-like kinases . the transcript abundances of two cbl-interacting protein kinases , two glycogen synthase kinases , a map kinase  <dig> protein , and a protein kinase superfamily protein isoform  <dig> , significantly decreased under dehydration, and exhibited a small but significant increase in abundance at 60% rwc  before decreasing below control levels as dehydration progressed.

the majority of sdats that encoded proteins associated with signaling kinase/phosphatase cascades responded to rehydration with either increased or decreased abundance to generate a return to the levels observed in control leaves. however, there were several transcripts that increased in abundance during rehydration in continuation of a dehydration-induced increase in abundance. two mpa kinase kinases  and a map kinase  <dig> , were among the most rehydration-responsive sdats, and were 3- to 4-fold more highly expressed in rehydrated than in control samples and 2- to 3-fold more highly expressed than in the desiccated samples. other transcripts that increased in abundance in response to rehydration included an abscisic acid-inducible protein kinase-like isoform  <dig> , casein kinase , cbl-interacting protein kinase  <dig> , cbl-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase  <dig> , cipk-like protein  <dig> , kinase-like protein , kelch repeat: kelch protein kinase , protein phosphatase 2c , serine/threonine-protein kinase sapk <dig> , and a two-component sensor histidine kinase .

sdats representing the signal transduction enzyme phospholipase d , accumulated early in the dehydration process  and peaked in abundance between 40% and 30% rwc.

transcription factors
a total of  <dig> sdats were annotated as transcription factors , 68% of which represented transcripts that significantly decreased in abundance during dehydration . the tf sdats represent  <dig> tf families and six unclassified zinc finger proteins. sdats representing four families of tfs  all increased in abundance during dehydration, whereas sdats representing eight other families of tfs  all decreased in abundance during dehydration. sdats for another eight families of tfs , and the group of five sdats encoding unclassified zinc finger proteins both increased and decreased in abundance during dehydration .fig.  <dig> categorization of sdats encoding members of transcription factor transcripts representing individual transcription factor families based on their response to dehydration in young leaf tissues of s. stapfianus. dark and light gray shading indicate the counts of tfs per families that increased or decreased in abundance during dehydration, respectively




circadian clock-associated proteins , constans-like proteins , and a circadian oscillator component  predominated among sdats whose transcripts became most depleted during leaf dehydration. three c3hc <dig> tf transcripts  were also more depleted in the dried tissues compared to control transcript abundances .

several sdats representing proteins involved in auxin-mediated responses decreased in abundance in all dehydrated samples and included the auxin-induced proteins , and the auxin-responsive aux/iaa family member iaa <dig> . however, although the transcript abundances of two auxin-response factor  <dig> sdats , an auxin-response factor  <dig>  and an auxin-induced protein  decreased upon dehydration, these transcripts exhibited a small but significant elevation in abundance relative to the control when dehydration reached 60% rwc, after which they decreased again to below control levels.

the majority of the tf transcripts that increased in abundance as s. stapfianus leaves dried accumulated substantially early in the drying series at 60% rwc and peaked in abundance at 30% rwc, prior to becoming depleted in the dried state. the abundance of a transcript encoding a zinc knuckle c3h protein  increased substantially in abundance as leaves reached 80% rwc, and peaked at 60% rwc prior to a gradual decrease as dehydration continued. thirteen other zinc finger proteins, including three transcripts annotated as constans-like proteins , that might represent a single transcript  increased during dehydration. the transcripts for these constans-like proteins responded in an opposite manner to those for other transcripts also annotated as constans-like proteins  in that they declined in abundance.

also prominent among the tf transcripts that increased in abundance in response to dehydration were an aba-responsive protein , an abre-binding factor protein , heat shock factor proteins , an a-6a-like heat stress transcription factor , athb- <dig> homeobox-leucine zipper proteins , and two tubby-like f-box protein 8-like proteins  that did not start to accumulate until the leaves had dehydrated to 60% rwc.

the abundance of almost all of the  <dig> tfs transcripts identified as sdats was modulated by rehydration and returned to levels observed in the hydrated controls, but in the majority of cases failed to do so within 24h, with some exceptions. the abundances of five tf transcripts that became depleted during dehydration increased significantly to levels above those of the hydrated controls during rehydration. these transcripts include a zinc finger a <dig> and an <dig> domain-containing stress-associated protein  <dig> , a whirly family tf , a zn2/cys <dig> dna-binding protein , and an iaa24-auxin-responsive aux/iaa family member . another five tf transcripts that increased in abundance during dehydration, but became depleted as the leaves desiccated, accumulated to levels that exceeded those of the hydrated controls upon rehydration including a ring zinc finger protein-like protein , a gata transcription factor  <dig> , a btf3-like transcription factor , an hsf8-like heat shock factor protein , and a nac-like protein . in addition, six other tf transcripts, although elevated in abundance during dehydration, also continued to accumulate upon and during the 24h-rehydration period. these included the zinc knuckle c3h protein  mentioned previously, a c <dig> finger domain protein , a wrky  <dig> transcription factor , a btf <dig> transcription factor , a dna-binding protein , a nac-like protein , and a tubby-like f-box protein 8-like protein .

sdats for lea proteins were among the most responsive groups in terms of increased transcript accumulation during the response to dehydration. the  <dig> sdats representing lea protein genes showed an increase in the associated transcript abundance early during drying as the leaves approached 80% rwc, to reach 3- to 4-fold when leaves had dehydrated to 40% and 30% rwc before decreasing slightly as desiccation approached . lea transcripts decreased in abundance as the leaves were rehydrated, but did not fall to the levels in hydrated controls by 24h. group  <dig> lea transcripts, represented by  <dig> sdats, were among the most responsive to dehydration;  <dig> of the most abundant   <dig> lea transcripts in the 30% rwc samples were group  <dig> leas. the next largest group of sdats encoding leas comprised of  <dig> contigs representing group  <dig> leas  followed by a group comprised of  <dig> group  <dig> lea transcripts, designated as seed maturation proteins. three group  <dig> leas showed some of the highest increases in abundance that began early during dehydration and reached increases of 5- to 6-fold above control levels at 30% rwc. all of the lea transcripts that exhibited an increase in abundance during dehydration exhibited a significant and rapid decrease in abundance within the first  <dig> h of rehydration from that observed in dried leaves. however, none returned to the abundances seen in hydrated controls within  <dig> h of rehydration

heat-shock proteins and molecular chaperones
sdats encoding heat shock and molecular chaperones did not generally exhibit high-magnitude changes in abundance during dehydration with one exception: the clpd <dig> chloroplastic-like chaperone protein  which exhibited a  <dig> -fold increase in abundance in leaves dehydrated to 30% rwc . several small molecular weight hsps  and three 70kd hsps  representing the plurality of sdats that increased in abundance in this functional category showed between 1- and 3-fold increases in abundance and the abundance of most of these peaked at 30% rwc. all sdats representing transcripts in this subset exhibit substantial transcript depletion in the transition from 30% rwc to the desiccated state. the transcript abundances for all of the sdats in this group decreased upon rehydration relative to those in dried leaves, but were still elevated compared to hydrated controls. transcripts encoded by contigs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> exhibited substantial depletion during dehydration, and either only partially recovered during rehydration or continued to decrease to well below hydrated control transcript abundances.

aba- and stress-inducible proteins
the majority of sdats that encode transcripts that increase in abundance during dehydration and representing genes that are classified as responsive to abiotic stress, did not reach a significant fold increase in abundance of greater than  <dig> until the leaf tissues reached between 60% rwc and 40% rwc and the expression of most peaked at 30% rwc . only two of the sdats responded positively and rapidly to dehydration and attained a significant fold increase in abundance at 80% rwc: a transcript encoding a senescence-associated protein  and a transcript encoding a stress-inducible membrane pore protein  that showed  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold increases in abundance respectively. the transcript abundance of the sdat that annotated as the stress-inducible membrane pore protein continued to increase to a peak at 30% rwc, but that of the senescence associate protein decreased as dehydration intensified but remained above that of the control. the abiotic stress-related sdats that increased most in abundance  encode elips  or lea proteins, as described earlier. other transcripts that increased significantly in abundance during the dehydration process include those encoding an aba-induced plasma membrane protein , desiccation-related proteins , salt and cold-induced proteins , le25-like proteins , senescence-associated proteins , and hva22-like proteins . in general, all of the sdats in this category that increased in abundance during dehydration significantly decreased during rehydration, but did not return to the hydrated control levels of abundance.

several sdats that were annotated within the abiotic stress-responsive category exhibited a significant decrease in transcript abundance during dehydration. these sdats included those that encode several salt stress-responsive proteins , an hva22-like protein , two 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase proteins , and an aba-induced protein  that started to decrease in abundance early in the dehydration treatment. transcripts for the majority of the sdats that decreased in abundance during dehydration are steadily replenished as rehydration advances, but do not attain levels observed in the hydrated controls, with the exception of a transcript annotated as a uvb-resistance protein , which remained depleted even after  <dig> h of recovery.

upon rehydration, the abundances of the majority of abiotic stress-related sdats tended to return to those of the hydrated control. however, three of the putative senescence-associated protein sdats  and a sdat annotated as an early drought-induced protein  accumulated to significant levels upon rehydration, peaking at  <dig> h into rehydration.

protein synthesis and degradation
transcripts encoding proteins involved in protein synthesis and turnover were well represented in the dehydration and rehydration response transcriptomes  . the majority of the sdats  that were annotated as related to protein synthesis represented transcripts encoding the 40s and 60s ribosomal subunit proteins and four chloroplast  <dig> kda ribonucleoproteins . the abundances of transcripts for these ribosomal proteins, in general, increased during the early stages of dehydration  and tended to remain elevated as desiccation was achieved. however, rehydration appeared to be the major trigger of an increase in abundance of these transcripts, some of which, such as the transcript for the 60s ribosomal protein l <dig> , increased as much as  <dig> -fold. transcripts for translation initiation  or elongation factors  had similar patterns of changes in abundance as those seen for the ribosomal protein sdats. only nine transcripts decreased in abundance at all stages of leaf dehydration including those encoding translation elongation factor g , elongation factor tu , a translation factor chloroplastic-like guf <dig> homolog , and the post-translational modification polypeptides ubiquitin  and polyubiquitin .

cluster analysis
cluster analysis of transcript abundances during each stage of dehydration was performed to identify coordinated expression patterns and reveal any functional control of the response of s. stapfianus to dehydration that might be exerted by tissue water content. a cluster analysis for transcript abundances during rehydration was performed but, as there were only two rehydration treatments,  <dig> and  <dig> h, the analysis did not yield a robust analysis. as the quality-controlled normalized data were normally distributed, the anova analysis and the choice of parametric similarity metric were meaningful. clusters were defined at a threshold of  <dig> ; specifically, groups of sdats with an average pairwise pearson correlation of  <dig>  or more were deemed a cluster. the sdats separated into  <dig> clusters in this way . of these  <dig> clusters,  <dig> clusters contained  <dig> or more sdats; these clusters represented 71% of the total sdats. remaining clusters contained only one or two sdats .

four clusters  predominate among sdats that exhibit increased transcript abundance during dehydration, accounting for  <dig>  or  <dig> % of all sdats . clusters d <dig> and d <dig> that contained sdats that increased in abundance between  <dig> and 60% rwc or plateaued in abundance at 40% rwc  or peaked in abundance at 30% rwc . these two clusters contained most of the sdats that encoded lea or lea-like proteins. cluster d <dig> contained  <dig> lea/lea-like transcripts, including the majority of the group  <dig> lea sdats, whereas cluster d <dig> contained  <dig> lea/lea-like transcripts including all those encoding the group  <dig> lea protein  on the array. these two major clusters also contained a number of transcripts that encode proteins important in redox homeostasis pathways. the majority of the 1-cys peroxiredoxin-encoding transcripts belonged to clusters d <dig> and d <dig> and all of the superoxide dismutase transcripts belonged to cluster d <dig>  cluster d <dig> contained glutaredoxins, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, and glutathione reductase as other representatives of redox homeostasis pathways. cluster d <dig> included all but one of the sdats encoding elip proteins, all of the sdats encoding glucose and ribitol dehydrogenase, and a large percentage of sdats encoding proteins such as aldose reductase, carboxylesterase 13-like proteins, cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase, nitronate monooxygenase, peroxisomal proteins, and aldehyde dehydrogenases, which are involved in cellular detoxification pathways. cluster d <dig> also contained all of the pyruvate decarboxylase sdats and two of the alcohol deydrogenase sdats, both of which were associated with fermentation pathways. cluster d <dig> also contained several sdats whose transcripts encoded enzymes associated with cell wall modification including all of the endo-beta-mannanase encoding sdats, as well as those encoding glucan endo- <dig>  3-beta-glucosidase and glycosyl hydrolase.

cluster d <dig> included sdats that increased in abundance during the first stage of dehydration from hydrated to 80% rwc, maintained a steady elevated transcript abundance until tissues were between 40rwc and 30% rwc followed by reduced accumulation, then by another increase in abundance as the tissues continued to dry to between 30% rwc and the desiccated state. this cluster was almost completely populated by transcripts encoding proteins involved in retrotransposon activity, gag-pol polyproteins, reverse transcriptase, and several unclassified retrotransposon proteins.

cluster d <dig> included sdats that increased steadily in abundance during the first stage of dehydration from hydrated to 40% rwc, maintained a constant elevated abundance until tissues reached 30% rwc followed by a rapid reduction in abundance as the tissues desiccated. this cluster contained six protein phosphatase 2c sdats that were elevated during dehydration and three phospholipase d  transcripts. notably, the cluster also included several sdats associated with carbohydrate metabolism such as sucrose synthase, hexokinase, and sugar and hexose transporters, as well as those associated with various aspects of redox homeostasis pathways such as glutathione reductase and mono-dehydroascorbate reductase. hexose transporters and some of the transcripts associated with redox homeostasis were also featured in cluster d <dig> , which has a profile of transcript abundance pattern very similar to that of cluster d <dig>  except that transcript abundances decreased relatively rapidly between 40% and 30% rwc.

of the clusters that that showed decreasing transcript abundance during dehydration, clusters d <dig> and d <dig> accounted for  <dig> sdats  <dig> % of the total) and all of the sdats with no elevation in transcript abundance at any stage during dehydration  . clusters d <dig> and d <dig> showed mutually similar patterns of transcript abundance during dehydration. transcript abundances in these two clusters decreased slightly or remained constant as the plants dried from hydrated to 60% rwc, followed by a rapid decrease in the tissues dried between 60% and dryness. the transcript abundances of sdats within cluster d <dig> decreased more precipitously than did those in d <dig>  cluster d <dig> included sdats representing transcripts that encoded proteins directly associated with photosynthesis including  <dig> of the  <dig> sdats encoding chlorophyll a/b binding proteins, photosystem i reaction center subunits,  <dig> of the  <dig> sdats encoding pepc, all of the sdats encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, all sdats encoding photosystem ii reaction center w protein, all but one of the sdats encoding carbonic anhydrase, rubisco small subunit, and rubisco activase . this cluster also contained all but one of the sdats encoding sucrose-phosphate synthase. cluster d <dig> also contains all of the sdats encoding photosystem i reaction center subunit iii and the majority of those encoding ferredoxin, but has a much more varied membership.

validation of expression analysis data

discussion
the  <dig> sequence-generated transcriptome comprised  <dig>  unique contigs that formed the basis of the nimblegen oligonucleotide array used to measure gene expression reported here. although the gene expression analysis array technology is currently less used, it allowed for the analysis of large numbers of samples and less of a requirement for a reference genome sequence. it is not yet possible to determine what the coverage of the gene content of the s. stapfianus genome represented by these contigs. given the tetraploid genome size of  <dig>  pg/2c  <cit> , or haploid size of  <dig>  gb , it is highly unlikely that this transcriptome provides full representation. the annotation also reveals some apparent redundancy within the contig collection. however, it also clear from the functional group analyses and go assignments of the  <dig>  annotated contigs that the 454-generated transcriptome provided broad transcript representation of the functional cellular components and metabolic pathways and delivers a useful assessment of the response of s. stapfianus to both desiccation and rehydration. the 454-generated transcriptome described here is also similar in content and functional coverage to those reported for other resurrection angiosperms . given the recognized limitations of the nimblegen array technology, as described by mutz et al  <dig>  <cit> , this expression analysis does not provide a detailed assessment of the genetic aspects of the responses of s. stapfianus leaves to desiccation and rehydration, but does provide a solid platform for evaluating the functional roles that candidate genes play in the physiological and cellular perturbations during these responses in leaves.

the dehydration and desiccation response
the metabolome of dehydrating and desiccated leaves of s. stapfianus was detailed in an earlier report  <cit>  and is represented in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the analysis of the metabolome during drying revealed a number of significant perturbations as water is removed from the tissues. a primary response to dehydration was a substantial and steady accumulation of several amino acids, gamma-glutamyl dipeptides, carbohydrates, and anti-oxidants that reached maximum accumulation as the tissues dry . these compounds appear critical for the desiccation tolerance phenotype of s. stapfianus, either directly by facilitating cellular tolerance or indirectly by providing a source of metabolites necessary for recovery and subsequent whole-plant survival  <cit> .

amino acids start to increase in abundance early in the dehydration process presumably to fuel osmoregulation and resist water loss  <cit> . however, the transcriptome does not appear to reflect this process, suggesting that this early increase in amino acid concentrations is under metabolic control and is not fueled by an increase in the appropriate transcripts. the continued accumulation of amino acids in the young leaves of s. stapfianus as they approach desiccation is thought to be the result of nitrogen mobilization fueled by protein degradation that occurs during dehydration  <cit> . protein degradation occurs in young leaves during dehydration, although to a minor degree compared to that seen in mature desiccation-sensitive leaves that senesce as they dry  <cit> . this suggests that the accumulating amino acids are not primarily a result of increased biosynthesis, but rather of transport into the young leaves for storage to fuel growth when the plants are rehydrated. the transcriptome of the leaves undergoing dehydration appears to support this hypothesis as the abundance of transcripts encoding amino acid biosynthetic enzymes was generally unaltered , whereas that of transcripts encoding enzymes involved in protein degradation  are elevated and within the collection of sdats. storing nitrogen in the form of amino acids in the roots and crown tissues under stress conditions is a common adaptive tool that perennial grasses use to support new growth when conditions become favorable  <cit> . thus, it appears that s. stapfianus sequesters amino acids in the younger desiccation-tolerant leaves rather than in the roots and crown tissues as part of its strategy for surviving desiccation. s. stapfianus, along with other desiccation tolerant species also accumulates gamma-glutamyl dipeptides during dehydration, nitrogenous compounds involved in redox potential homeostasis in animal tissues  <cit> , although perhaps not in plants  <cit> . unfortunately, the 454-derived transcriptome that we developed for this study does include a transcript for the gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase  the enzyme responsible for their synthesis. thus we are unable to assess the role that transcript accumulation could play in this aspect of the desiccation response in this study.

the accumulation of sugars in vegetative tissues during the drying process is a common feature of desiccation-tolerant plants  <cit> . in s. stapfianus, sucrose steadily accumulates during drying, and then raffinose, stachyose, and the sugar alcohols galactinol and myo-inositol accumulate as desiccation is approached . within the dt trait, sugars, in particular sucrose, have been associated with intercellular glass formation that is postulated to slow chemical degradation and prevent membrane collapse during dehydration  <cit> . raffinose is reported to enhance this function of sucrose  <cit>  and galactinol and raffinose have been demonstrated to display anti-oxidation capabilities in vitro  <cit>  as has myo-inositol  <cit> . raffinose and stachyose also contribute to cellular stress protection and carbon storage . unlike the enzymes involved in amino acid biosynthesis, the transcripts for many of the enzymes involved in sucrose biosynthesis and in the raffinose family oligosaccharide  pathway accumulated during dehydration . the increased abundance of transcripts encoding sucrose synthase, galactinol synthase, raffinose synthase, and stachyose synthase demonstrate the importance of rfo intermediates in the dt phenotype. sucrose synthase and stachyose synthase also accumulate during the dehydration of haberlea rhodopensis and craterostigma plantagineum  <cit> . transcripts encoding sucrose synthase also accumulated in the initial phases of dehydration, between hydrated and 60% rwc , along with transcripts encoding several sugar transporters, which implies that the sucrose is likely transported both within the young leaves and to them. whittaker et al.   <cit>  concluded that the rapid loss of starch during dehydration of s. stapfianus leaves fuels the steady increase in sucrose ; however, the transcriptome analysis reported here did not present such a clear finding. transcripts for the starch-degrading enzyme beta-amylase varied in their response during dehydration. of the five sdats identified as beta-amylase four represent transcripts that decreased in abundance during dehydration  and only one represents transcripts that accumulated during drying , peaking late in the drying process at 30% rwc. the late increase in transcript abundance for the only positive beta-amylase sdat, the decrease in abundances of other beta-amylase transcripts, and the increase in abundance of an alpha-amylase inhibitor protein  would suggest that the early and rapid loss of starch in the leaves of the drying plant is under metabolic control. the increased abundance of the transcript encoding hexokinase throughout the dehydration process might also have contributed to the accumulation of sucrose and subsequent rfo at the expense of reducing sugars such as glucose and fructose. the activity of this enzyme increases during the dehydration of s. stapfianus and x. viscosa, highlighting its importance in lowering the toxicity of reducing sugars in the dehydrating tissues  <cit> .fig.  <dig> concordance between the abundance of intermediates in the biosynthesis of raffinose family oligosaccharides  and the transcripts encoding the enzymes of the pathway during the dehydration-rehydration cycle in young leaf tissues of s. stapfianus. a single longitudinal bar directly under the compound in the pathway represents the metabolite abundance heat map for each compound. the data used to generate the metabolite heat maps are reported in oliver et al  <dig>  red shading indicates a statistically significant fold increase in abundance and green shading a statistically significant fold decrease in metabolite abundance. white indicates no change in metabolite abundance. for the dehydrating samples  the fold change is given in relation to the hydrated control, where red shading indicates a statistically significant increase in abundance compared to the hydrated control for the dehydrating samples. for the rehydrating samples the fold change is given in relation to either the dry samples  or the hydrated control . the longitudinal bars directly associated with the enzyme identity in the pathway represent the transcript abundance heat map for each enzyme. each line in the heat map constitutes a single contig annotated as encoding the associated enzyme. red shading indicates a statistically significant the log2-fold increase in abundance and green shading a statistically significant the log2-fold decrease in abundance. black indicates no change in transcript abundance. for the dehydrating samples  the log2-fold change in abundance is given in relation to the hydrated control. for the rehydrating samples log2-fold change in abundance is given in relation to either the dry samples  or the hydrated control 




the dehydration-induced increase in the abundance of several transcripts encoding aldose reductase, a highly dehydration-responsive sdat , and rate-limiting enzyme in polyol biosynthesis  <cit>  could explain the accumulation of polyols , generally considered as osmolytes, in the dehydrated leaves of s. stapfianus  <cit>  and indicates a possible role for these compounds in the dt of this species.

the rapid catabolism of starch reserves during drying results in early accumulation of both maltose and glucose  <cit> , which drives the flow of carbon through glycolysis and the tca cycle and generates reducing power and atp  <cit> . presumably, this process generates the energy required to prepare cells to survive desiccation and to maintain cellular integrity in the dried state. the flow of carbon from glycolysis into the tca cycle results in an accumulation of the tca cycle intermediates citrate, cis-aconitate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate, and as well as glucose 6-phosphate  as the leaves approach desiccation  <cit> . the critical role of glycolysis and the tca cycle during dehydration is supported by the significant changes in the transcriptome, with increases in the abundances of several transcripts encoding key enzymes in these pathways in the early stages of dehydration, and peaks in their abundances just prior to the final stages leading to desiccation.

although the generation of reducing power and atp during dehydration is probably the critical role for the tca cycle in the establishment of cellular desiccation tolerance, the cycle might also direct metabolites to other important processes necessary for cellular well-being during dehydration. the tca cycle provides carbon skeletons for nitrogen assimilation through alpha-ketoglutarate  and oxaloacetate   <cit> , which are branch points for amino acid biosynthetic pathways. although the amino acids that accumulate in dehydrating young leaves of s. stapfianus could be derived from nitrogen mobilization from protein catabolism, there is also some evidence that amino acid biosynthesis also occurs during dehydration, at least in the early stages  <cit> . such a scenario might explain the lack of accumulation of oaa during dehydration and a twofold decline in this tca intermediate in the dry state. the accumulation of the carboxylic acid intermediates of the tca cycle might also indicate a need to delay the loss of turgor in the leaf cells to maintain function as the plants dry or to ensure ph homeostasis  <cit> , which is critical in maintaining metabolism during dehydration  <cit> . gamma-aminobutyrate , which accumulates during dehydration and is closely associated with the tca cycle via the gaba shunt, also has a proposed role in maintaining cellular ph during stress  <cit> . there is not a great deal of evidence that the importance of these processes is reflected in the transcriptome; however, the transcript of a vacuolar proton atpase  steadily accumulated during dehydration, as did that of a tonoplast dicarboxylate transporter , which increased early in dehydration before it began to decrease as the leaves desiccate. transcripts for glutamate decarboxylase , which catalyzes the conversion of glutamate to gaba and was classified as a cluster  <dig> sdat , accumulated during dehydration.

metabolite analyses of dehydrating s. stapfianus leaves suggested that the glutathiones and tocopherols, presumably situated in the cytoplasm and membranes respectively, were important components for protecting cells against dehydration-induced accumulation of ros  <cit> ). a role of the glutathione in protecting cells from ros activity and maintaining redox homeostasis is a common feature of resurrection species  <cit>  and tocopherols have long been implicated in maintaining membrane integrity under the threat of ros during seed desiccation  <cit> ). the transcript profiles observed here appear to support the observed increases in these metabolites with significant increases in the abundance of transcripts encoding glutathione synthase , γ-glutamyl cysteine synthetase  and glutathione reductase , and tocopherol cyclase, the enzyme that converts various phytyl quinol pathway intermediates into their corresponding tocopherols  <cit> .

concentrations of ascorbic acid, a key component of a redox hub responsible for integrating metabolic responses to environmental stimuli via a cellular signaling network  <cit> , remains essentially unchanged throughout the dehydration  process. however, dehydration does result in a significant increase in one of the precursors of ascorbate, gulono- <dig> -lactone, and a significant accumulation of threonate, a catabolite of ascorbate  <cit> , which indicates that ascorbic acid metabolism is in flux during the dehydration-rehydration cycle and might play a role in the desiccation tolerance mechanism in s. stapfianus.

the transcriptome provides further evidence of a central role for redox homeostasis and protection from the damaging effects of ros production during dehydration in the desiccation tolerance phenotype of s. stapfianus. the dehydration-induced disturbance of cellular homeostasis resulted in the deployment of several enzymatic antioxidants along with the aforementioned metabolites to control the damaging effects of toxic reactive oxygen intermediates  <cit> . in the transcriptome of the dehydrating s. stapfianus leaf, transcripts encoding thiol-based peroxidases, 1-cys peroxiredoxins, represented the most desiccation-responsive sdats that accumulate during dehydration. the 1-cys peroxiredoxins reduce h2o <dig> and alkyl hydroperoxides  <cit>  and appear to be dehydration-induced in both seeds and resurrection plants, but not in the vegetative tissues of ds species even under stress conditions  <cit> ), which suggests their critical role in desiccation tolerance. several superoxide dismutase  transcripts also increased significantly in abundance during dehydration in s. stapfianus leaves, as was seen in dehydrating xerophyta viscosa  <cit> , which indicates a need to prevent the activity of oxygen free radical activity during dehydration in resurrection species  <cit> . although not strictly an anti-oxidant, transcript abundance for the detoxification enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase also increases significantly during desiccation  and has been associated with the desiccation response in a diverse range of resurrection species, including craterostigma plantagineum  <cit>  and the moss syntrichia  ruralis  <cit> . this enzyme is postulated to detoxify excess aldehydes that accumulate as metabolism is disrupted during dehydration  <cit> .

along with the 1-cys peroxiredoxins, transcripts encoding elips comprised a significant proportion of the most abundant sdats. elips are proteins that are believed to bind chlorophylls as a means to protect chloroplasts from ros-induced photo-oxidative damage  <cit>  and their transcripts have been reported to increase in abundance in the leaves of several resurrection species, including boea hygrometica  <cit> , haberlea rhodopensis  <cit> , and craterostigma plantagineum  <cit> ). neale et al.,  <dig>  <cit> , using a cold-plaque technique, cloned an elip cdna from s. stapfianus that was induced in leaf tissues during dehydration. the timing of the accumulation of this elip transcript was important as it coincided with the beginning of the non-photochemical quenching period during dehydration  <cit> . the transcript encoded by the elip cdna did not accumulate in response to dehydration in detached leaves of s. stapfianus , nor could stress-inducible homologous transcripts be detected in water-deficit stressed ds sporobolus pyramidalis. the commonality of desiccation-induced accumulation of elip transcripts in resurrection plants testifies to their importance in desiccation tolerance strategies and the need to protect chloroplast membranes from ros-induced damage  <cit> .

clearly, mechanisms that limit cellular damage due to ros during dehydration of leaf tissues are an important component of desiccation tolerance in many, if not all, desiccation-tolerant plants and tissues. in leaf tissues, ros are thought to be produced primarily through the disruption of normal electron flow through photosystems i and ii and the resulting increases in both photoreduction of oxygen and photorespiration during dehydration and declining co <dig> assimilation  <cit> . in resurrection species, this process is amplified when dehydration of leaves occurs under high light conditions, which is typical of their natural habitats. to add to the likelihood of ros production and injury, s. stapfianus is a homeochlorophyllous resurrection species that retains the majority  of its chlorophyll  <cit>  and preserves chloroplast integrity  <cit>  during dehydration and in the dried state. as for all resurrection species studied so far  <cit> , photosynthesis in s. stapfianus is very sensitive to dehydration and shows a rapid and linear decline in co <dig> assimilation to complete cessation at approximately 45% rwc   <cit> . this sensitivity was manifested in the transcriptome as significant depletion of transcripts encoding many major components of the photosystems, enzymes of carbon fixation, and the calvin cycle. transcripts for pepc, the key carbon fixation enzyme in c <dig> species , were rapidly depleted during dehydration  and were the most depleted of all of the dehydration-repressed sdats. mirroring this decline was the repression of transcripts for other proteins involved in carbon fixation , and photosystem structure , all in clusters d <dig> and d <dig>  the loss of these transcripts is unlikely to be the direct cause of the cessation of carbon fixation during drying  <cit> , but it does signify a programmed repression of gene expression associated with processes that are either untenable or harmful during dehydration and a switch of available resources to the accumulation of transcripts that are necessary for surviving the desiccated state.


s. stapfianus has evolved morphological strategies to limit the absorption of light energy and the likelihood of ros generation in leaf tissues when desiccated. this species does so by retaining a large proportion of leaf chlorophyll and preserving thylakoid membranes during drying and in the dried state to enable rapid resumption of photosynthesis upon rehydration  <cit> . as s. stapfianus dries, differential contraction of rows of leaf cells cause the leaf blades to curl such that below 44% rwc leaf margins curve over one another. at even lower rwc the leaves become spike-like  <cit> . the result of this morphological change, in the context of light production of ros in high light, is a significant decrease in the surface area of the leaf available for light absorbance as well as a more upright stature that decreases exposure to direct sunlight and reduces leaf temperatures. although initially driven by differential cell contraction, the folding of cell walls and the modification of cell wall properties are thought to play a major role in dehydration-induced changes in leaf morphology  <cit> ). the metabolome of dehydrating s. stapfianus leaves revealed a late accumulation of ferulate and caffeate, precursors of cell wall lignin and cross-linking compounds  indicating, perhaps, an inhibition of lignin biosynthesis and a decrease in cell wall cross-linking. that the latter might be the case is suggested by the increased abundance of transcripts for feruloyl esterase  during dehydration. feruloyl esterase catalyzes the release of ferulate and ferulate dehydrodimers from cell walls of grasses by the cleavage of ester bonds that cross-link ferulic acid to polysaccharides, primarily arabinoxylans  <cit> , which enhances cell wall extensibility  <cit> . the importance of cell wall loosening in the response to desiccation, and perhaps tolerance, in s. stapfianus leaves is also supported by the early accumulation of transcripts encoding other cell wall hydrolases, such as endo-beta-mannanase and beta-mannan endohydrolase, along with those encoding cell wall hydrolases. equally notable was the dehydration-induced depletion of cellulose synthase  which indicates a cessation of cell wall biosynthesis.

as was expected from the transcriptome-based investigations on the response of resurrection angiosperms to dehydration and desiccation  <cit> , leaves of s. stapfianus accumulate transcripts that encode lea proteins and other aba-responsive proteins. lea transcripts were by far the largest group of all types of transcripts that accumulated during dehydration, particularly during early dehydration, and also recorded the highest transcript abundance throughout the dehydration process. lea proteins are believed to protect cells from desiccation-induced damage by acting as hydration buffers or by direct protection of proteins and membranes  <cit> ,  <cit> . group  <dig> lea transcripts predominate the dehydration transcriptome of s. stapfianus and prevent or reduce protein aggregation alone or in combination with disaccharides during dehydration in vitro  <cit> . the ubiquity of increased lea protein transcript abundance in the transcriptomes of angiosperm resurrection species during dehydration and their classification as seed maturation proteins underpins the hypothesis that resurrection plants evolved their mechanism of desiccation tolerance from a reprogramming of the developmentally controlled seed desiccation tolerance .

many of the abiotic stress-related transcripts that were induced during dehydration appeared around 30% rwc. this late response to dehydration included transcripts encoding several aba-inducible proteins such as elips , protein le25-like, hva22-like protein, and responsive to aba, which is consistent with the steady increase in endogenous aba during dehydration. transcripts encoding several heat shock proteins , ranging from smaller  to larger  hsps, accumulated during dehydration and many peaked later stages of dehydration at  <dig>  g h2o/g dwt, a common observation for both desiccating seeds and resurrection plants  <cit> . hsps, in particular the smaller chaperonins and protein disaggregates, are important components for maintaining protein homeostasis  <cit> . the dehydration and rehydration of cells has a major impact on protein structural integrity and aggregation that clearly must be mitigated for survival.

many aspects of the dehydration response in s. stapfianus, reported here and elsewhere  <cit> , such as elevated sugar content, alterations in protein homeostasis, and changes in hormone levels are triggers for leaf senescence  <cit> , which suggests that delay or inhibition of senescence is a critical aspect of vegetative desiccation tolerance in this grass  <cit> . neither the metabolome nor the transcriptome of the young desiccation-tolerant leaves presented here support or refute this possibility. however, we did observe an accumulation of transcripts that related to senescence, although the annotation of these transcripts simply describes cdna sequences isolated from senescing pea pods  <cit> , with no experimental evidence that they are actually associated with any process related to leaf senescence. we also observed an accumulation of transcripts encoding udp-glycosyltransferase , in agreement with the isolation of a dehydration-induced udp-glycosyltransferase gene from s. stapfianus  <cit>  that is postulated to metabolize strigolactone , which in turn might inhibit leaf senescence during drying  <cit> . however, the increase in abundance of this transcript is relatively modest at  <dig> -fold above the maximum in the hydrated control leaves . recently  <cit> ) the induction of autophagy by a dehydration-induced accumulation of the disaccharide trehalose, which prevented the onset of senescence and programmed cell death in the leaves of the resurrection grass tripogon loliiformis was reported. trehalose was not detected in the leaf metabolome  of s. stapfianus in contradiction of earlier reports  <cit> . our current results are difficult to reconcile with the previous report  <cit> ) as the methodologies for sugar analysis differed considerably between the two studies. it is extremely unlikely that trehalose was simply undetected in s. stapfianus using the metabolon mass spectrometry-based metabolomics platform , as it is identical to that used for analysis of samples from the resurrection lycophyte selaginella lepidophylla, in which trehalose was evident  <cit> . we have also identified trehalose in root samples of s. stapfianus using the metabolon platform . thus, if autophagy is induced in s. stapfianus leaves during dehydration to inhibit dehydration-induced senescence, and trehalose is absent in the leaves of s. stapfianus during dehydration, then a different signaling mechanism would be required.

the complexity of the response of s. stapfianus to dehydration/desiccation and rehydration was evident from the many changes in both individual metabolite and transcript abundances, which as discussed by dinakar and bartels  <dig>  <cit> , this requires a “fine-tuned regulatory network”. the complexity of these responses is also reflected in the heterogeneity of the transcripts for regulatory proteins that change significantly in abundance during dehydration. in the early stages of dehydration, between hydrated and 80% rwc, transcripts encoding protein phosphatase 2c proteins, a negative regulator of aba signaling in the acquisition of desiccation tolerance  <cit> , in combination with low levels of aba at these leaf water contents  <cit>  suggest that aba does not control the initial response to dehydration. the decrease in the abundance of these transcripts prior to the increase in endogenous aba concentrations possibly reflects the importance of this phytohormone in the latter stages of drying as desiccation tolerance is acquired. however, the transcriptome results do point to signaling pathways that might be required for responding to dehydration and preparing for desiccation. an increase in the abundance of transcripts encoding phospholipase d indicates the early activation of a non-aba signal transduction pathway similar to that described for the dehydration response to of the resurrection dicot craterostigma plantagineum  <cit> . in addition, the early increase in the abundance of transcripts encoding snf1-related protein kinase regulatory subunit gamma-1-like proteins , which are required for stability and substrate specificity  <cit> , suggests that the rapid change in carbohydrate  concentrations and energy status of s. stapfianus leaves early in the dehydration event  <cit>  might also play an active role in the stress signaling pathways required to prepare for desiccation. calcium signaling also appears to play a role in orchestrating both the dehydration and the later desiccation stages of leaves as transcripts for calcineurin b-like  proteins accumulate both early, between hydrated and 80% rwc, and late as leaves reach 30% rwc. cipk-like protein  <dig> transcripts, kinases that interact with cbl proteins  <cit> , also accumulated late in the drying process. the complexity of the signaling response is also reflected by the fact that many transcripts that are annotated as encoding the same signaling protein are represented by different contigs and exhibit both increases and decreases in abundance. this suggest that these contigs represent transcripts from different members of a gene family or different splicing events that are regulated in different manners. such regulation might occur in a tissue/cell specific manner and, as the whole leaf is used to generate an rna sample, this possibility could not be interrogated.

the complexity of the signaling response is also apparent in the changes in transcript abundance of a variety of transcription factors  that alter gene expression and thereby orchestrate the dehydration response. the expression of transcripts for over 60% of the tfs identified in the 454-derived leaf transcriptome were negatively impacted by dehydration. presumably, the majority of these tfs, such as those involved in auxin-mediated responses, were associated with normal growth, differentiation, and development, which ceases as the plant dehydrates. the expression of tfs involved in regulating the circadian clock and flowering is also repressed by dehydration. surprisingly however, the transcriptome did not contain an induced sdat representing the ap2/erf family of transcription factors, particularly a dehydration responsive element binding  factor, as these are known to participate in dehydration responses in non-desiccation tolerant plants  <cit>  and the resurrection shrub myrothamnus flabellifolia  <cit> . the abundance of such dreb transcripts might be too low to have been represented in the s. stapfianus 454-generated transcriptome, but no responsive dreb factor appeared in the dehydration transcriptome of the resurrection plant craterostigma plantagineum either  <cit> . thus, perhaps dreb factors are not necessary for the regulation of desiccation tolerance in all resurrection species. the abundance of the majority of the tfs classified as positive sdats increased relatively early in the dehydration process and peaked when leaves reached 30% rwc. the earliest tfs to peak in abundance were a zinc knuckle c3h protein  and a homeobox domain leucine zipper  protein  that peaked at 60% rwc. zinc finger c3h proteins have been implicated in salt/dehydration stress responses in cotton  <cit>  and in stress tolerance in transgenic arabidopsis by regulating aba/sugar responses  <cit> . the expression of oszfp <dig>  a rice cchc-type zinc finger protein, is regulated by several types of stress treatments, in particular oxidative stress, and overexpression of this protein in arabidopsis rendered the transgenic plant more tolerant to hydrogen peroxide treatment  <cit> . the arabidopsis hd-zip transcription factor homologs athb <dig> and athb <dig> function in environmental and hormonal signal transduction pathways, respectively  <cit> . along with the early responsive transcript encoded by contig  <dig>  we identified three other contigs  encoding hd-zip proteins whose transcripts all peaked in abundance late during drying, concomitant with the peak in aba abundance . five hd-zip transcription factors were identified in the resurrection dicot craterostigma plantagineum all of which responded to dehydration and aba, but were repressed upon rehydration  <cit> . one of these craterostigma hd-zip proteins  acted as a negative regulator of aba-responsive gene expression when expressed ectopically in tobacco  <cit> . an abre binding factor transcript also accumulated early in dehydration, but peaked late as the leaves approached 30% rwc, and acted as a positive regulator of aba biosynthesis  <cit> . such an increase coincides with induction of several aba-responsive genes, as discussed earlier. similarly, the abundance of transcripts encoding up to four dehydration-inducible sdats encoding hsf-tf proteins, all increased during dehydration, coincident with the induction of several small hsps and molecular chaperones. other tf sdats, such as those encoding nf-y, nac, and bzip proteins, have also been induced by dehydration in other resurrection plants  <cit> , although their possible target genes related to desiccation tolerance are unknown.

the rehydration and recovery response
rehydration from a fully dried state is as stressful to plant tissues as dehydration, on structural to physiological and biochemical levels  <cit> . although rehydration from the dried state elicits a significant cellular response in dt bryophytes  <cit> , it is somewhat surprising that resurrection angiosperms exhibit a more muted response . this may simply reflect a more effective cellular protection mechanism in the resurrection angiosperms that severely limits desiccation-induced damage, but nevertheless, rehydration-induced mechanisms are likely critical for the recovery of growth when full water status is restored  <cit> .

in s. stapfianus, rehydration-specific responses are limited both metabolically and transcriptionally as compared to the dehydration response. as in other resurrection species, the major response is to quickly return to the pre-desiccation hydrated status. in s. stapfianus, the responses of both the metabolome and the transcriptome indicated that recovery was not fully achieved within the  <dig> h rehydration period used in our study. rehydration per se can take some time, even though the rehydration procedure we use applies water to both the soil and aerial portions of the plant. rehydration may also involve rapid recovery of aquaporins, or plasma membrane intrinsic proteins , to facilitate water movement into cells as evidenced by rapid recovery in the abundance of transcripts encoding pips within the first  <dig> h of rehydration . notably, transcripts encoding tonoplast membrane intrinsic proteins  accumulate, presumably to regulate water movement in and out of the vacuoles .

photosynthesis, as measured by co <dig> assimilation recovers rapidly and reaches approximately 70% of control hydrated values within the first  <dig> h after rehydration  <cit> . the recovery of photosynthesis was reflected in these data by the rapid re-accumulation of transcripts encoding enzymes and components of the photosynthetic machinery and associated metabolism, most notably transcripts encoding chlorophyll a/b binding  proteins and pepc . metabolic intermediates in the c <dig> carbon assimilation pathway and the calvin cycle were generally at too low concentrations to be reliably detected in our experiments, with the exception of malate, pyruvate, oxaloacetate, and fructose-6-phosphate. both pyruvate and oxaloacetate remain depleted during rehydration, but malate levels, which were elevated in the dried leaves, remained above the hydrated control levels. the inference is that pepc activity did not fully recover after  <dig> h of rehydration and that the decarboxylating activity of malate dehydrogenase  might also be inhibited. the accumulation of fructose-6-phosphate might indicate the recovery of the calvin cycle, but also coincides with similar accumulation of glucose-6-phosphate, which might indicate alterations in glycolytic activity as the leaves recover. upon rehydration, respiration rates also recover, increasing linearly with increasing relative leaf water content  <cit>  also noted that sucrose was not mobilized in the early stages of rehydration and that alternate substrates such as amino acids were presumably used for respiration. the metabolome presented here supports that conclusion, as sucrose levels remained elevated, near the level recorded for dried leaves, and did not drop significantly during  <dig> h of rehydration . atp is retained in dried leaves of s. stapfianus, but at reduced levels relative to the hydrated state, but perhaps sufficient to fuel the initial stages of rehydration  <cit> . nevertheless, the abundance of transcripts encoding atp synthase recovered rapidly .

the abundance of several amino acids either remained elevated or became elevated upon and during rehydration, perhaps reflecting the slow return to normal growth and nitrogen assimilation patterns. s. stapfianus is a slow-growing grass even under well-watered conditions and thus is expected to return slowly to normal growth rates following a desiccation event. two important kinetic factors are associated with the return of amino acid pools to the normal hydrated control state. one is the synthesis of proteins required for recovery or to replenish proteins depleted under desiccation. the other is the turnover of damaged proteins to restore protein homeostasis. the rehydration transcriptome reflects the activity of these two processes in the first  <dig> h of rehydration as increases in the abundance of transcripts associated with both protein synthesis and turnover to control or higher levels. transcripts for translation initiation and elongation factors and a subunit of the peptide release factor are both prominent in the rapid recovery of transcripts encoding proteins involved in protein synthesis. similar increases in abundance of transcripts involved in protein synthesis upon rehydration were reported for the resurrection shrub myrothamnus flabellifolia  <cit>  indicating that a rapid return of protein synthetic activity is a common feature of resurrection plant dehydration tolerance mechanisms. earlier work by o’mahony and oliver   <cit>  suggested an important role for ubiquitin in the response of s. stapfianus to rehydration, presumably related to its role in protein turnover. an increase in transcripts for polyubiquitin as well as increases in both ubiquitin monomer levels and ubiquinated proteins occur during rehydration. the leaf transcriptome reinforces the importance of the role of protein ubiquitination during rehydration: the abundance of ubiquitin transcripts recovers to levels above those of controls and the abundance of ubiquitin-activation and ubiquitin conjugation protein transcripts also recovers rapidly . also, the need to turn over damaged proteins upon rehydration could account for the increase in concentrations of some amino acids in the first  <dig> h after the re-addition of water.

the rehydration metabolome indicates the need to protect membranes from ros cellular homeostasis is reestablished, as reflected by the maintenance of increased levels of the lipophylic antioxidants alpha-, beta-, and delta-tocopherol. tocopherols prevent the proliferation of lipid peroxidation in membranes  <cit> , which constitutes a serious threat to membrane integrity. the reported elevation in the content of lysolipids in dried leaf tissue of s. stapfianus indicates that lipid peroxidation does occur during dehydration  <cit>  and although the levels of lysolipids then decline during rehydration  the potential for peroxidation still exists. the generation of ros and their effects on membrane integrity, have long been associated with rehydration  of desiccation-tolerant tissues  <cit>  together with the maintenance of high levels of tocopherols, s. stapfianus also maintained elevated levels of the cytoplasmic antioxidant, reduced glutathione. the rehydration transcriptome emphasizes the continued importance of protecting tissues from oxidative metabolism and ros during rehydration through the elevated abundance of transcript for several enzymes involved in redox homeostasis, including catalase and phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase.

the complex control of gene expression associated with rehydration appears to be as intricate as that involved in the response to dehydration. just as for dehydration, there were indications in these experiments that both aba and calcium-signaling pathways are important in the response to rehydration. this was exemplified by the accumulation of transcripts encoding an aba-activated serine/threonine-protein kinase sapk <dig>  protein phosphatase 2c, and cbl-interacting protein kinases . serine/threonine-protein kinase sapk <dig> phosphorylates bzip transcription factors that regulate downstream gene expression events associated with responses to water-deficit stress and are inactivated by protein phosphatase 2c  <cit> . in concordance with the transcriptome, the elevated endogenous aba levels  in the rehydrating leaves suggest that the aba signaling pathway is up-regulated during the recovery process. the possibility that aba might actually play a role in the control of gene expression upon rehydration is also suggested by the increase in abundance of transcripts encoding several tfs that are often targets for aba signaling pathways. the zinc finger a <dig> and an <dig> domain-containing stress-associated protein is reportedly induced by drought and aba  <cit> , as are the nac type btf <dig> transcription factors  <cit> . it is also noteworthy that transcripts for a two-component sensor histidine kinase accumulate during the rehydration process, as these proteins are often associated with plant responses to environmental changes in and have been closely linked to redox sensing under abiotic stress  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the combination of transcriptome and metabolome analyses has revealed further insights into the complexity of the desiccation response and the vegetative desiccation tolerance trait in the c <dig> grass sporobolus stapfianus. the concordance between the transcriptome and metabolome appears to be relatively strong in areas of this response related directly to cellular protection during dehydration. this is particularly evident in the dehydration-induced accumulation of transcripts for enzymes that synthesize carbohydrates , whose peaks in abundance just precede those of their carbohydrate metabolites . the concordance between transcript and metabolite abundance also appears to hold for some of the key anti-oxidants such as glutathione and tocopherols. there is almost no concordance between transcript and metabolite abundance for processes that do not appear to contribute directly to cellular protection, but are important for the dt phenotype of s. stapfianus. one example is the lack of a transcriptional response related to the accumulation of amino acids in young dt leaves as water is lost from the plant. although the retention and storage of nitrogen as amino acids for remobilization during rehydration might be critical for the survival of s. stapfianus after the end of a dry period, it does not appear to play a major role in the protection of the cells during the later stages of drying and in the dried state. the accumulation of amino acids during the latter stages of drying, although reported for both s. stapfianus  and selaginella lepidophylla  <cit> , is not a universal phenotype in resurrection species  <cit> . the metabolomic and transcriptomic data support the hypothesis that the build-up of amino acids in the leaves of s. stapfianus during drying results from the mobilization of nitrogen from the mature ds leaves that senesce during this process, as proposed by martinelli et al,  <dig>  <cit> . this might be a survival feature derived from the perennial aspects of nitrogen storage and remobilization during overwintering commonly seen in c <dig> forage grasses  <cit> . this would allow s. stapfianus to make efficient use of assimilated nitrogen during rehydration and is perhaps a critical need in its native nutrient-poor habitat  <cit> . much of the dehydration transcriptome appears to support the metabolic focus of cellular protection, with increases in the abundances of leas, elips, ros protection enzymes, and cell wall enzyme transcripts.

it is difficult to determine if transcript and metabolite abundance are coordinated during rehydration, as we do not have sufficient time points to make a reliable determination. the general trend during rehydration is a rapid return to normal metabolite and transcript abundance levels, with only a few metabolites, primarily involved in ros protection, displaying increases in abundance. overall, the rehydration transcriptome is geared towards the rapid return of photosynthesis, energy metabolism, protein turnover, and protein synthesis.

the transcriptomes of both dehydration and rehydration offer insight into the complex regulation of the response to both environmental perturbations. the early response to dehydration appears to be controlled by non-aba signaling mechanisms, similar to those seen in the desiccation-tolerant dicot craterostigma plantagineum  <cit> , that include the phospholipase d, calcium, and sugar signaling pathways. ros signaling might also play a key role in the control of the transcriptomic response to dehydration. the responses to both dehydration and rehydration involve the activity of a myriad of tfs spanning most known tf gene families. aba, as reported earlier  <cit> , appears to play a major role in the latter stages of the dehydration response as desiccation is approached. however, aba levels remain high during the early stages of rehydration, concomitant with an increase in the abundance of transcripts of aba-regulated genes, including aba-responsive tfs, implying a role for this hormone in the rehydration response. the high level of aba in rehydrating tissue might simply reflect the fact that the rehydration process is incomplete and there is still considerable dehydration stress in the young leaves, even  <dig> h after the plant received water. it might also reflect a need for transcripts involved in redox homeostasis and protein turnover.
