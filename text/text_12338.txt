BACKGROUND
zinc is an essential micronutrient that plays many important roles in various physiological and metabolic processes in all living organisms. it functions as a cofactor for over  <dig> enzymes and proteins involved in cell division, nucleic acid metabolism and protein synthesis, and is critical in the control of gene transcription and the coordination of other biological processes regulated by proteins containing dna-binding zn-finger motifs, ring fingers and lim domains  <cit> .

it has been demonstrated that zn deficiency is one of the most widespread mineral nutritional problems affecting normal development in plants  <cit> . this includes altered expression and/or function of proteins at the metabolic level that leads to different physiological symptoms characterized by root apex necrosis. at the same time, sub-lethal zn deficiency induces spatial heterogeneous or interveinal chlorosis, development of reddish-brown or bronze tints and a range of auxin deficiency-like responses such as internode shortening, epinasty, inward curling of leaf lamina and reduction of leaf size  <cit> . in grapevines, deficit of zn results in the development of leaves that are smaller than normal and/or mottled, and shortened internodes. it has been suggested that this reduction in shoot growth results from the fact that zn is essential for the synthesis of tryptophan, a precursor of the phytohormone indoleacetic acid   <cit> . another important symptom of zn deficiency in grapevines is the production of clusters with few berries that also vary in size from normal to very small  <cit> . in this way, vineyards commonly correct zn deficiency with both soil and foliar application of fertilizers. under conditions of zn deficiency, application of foliar zn fertilizer shortly before anthesis increases the number of flowers that set fruit  <cit> .

since zn cannot passively diffuse across cell membranes, it must be transported into intracellular compartments for all biological processes where zn is required. several members of the  <dig> zinc-regulated transporters, iron-regulated transporter-like protein  gene family have been characterized in arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , and their involvement in metal uptake and transport in plants has been demonstrated  <cit> .

arabidopsis zip <dig> and zip <dig> genes are expressed in roots in response to zn deficiency, suggesting that they transport zn from the soil to the plant. zip <dig> is expressed either in roots and shoots, showing a delicate regulation to control the homeostasis of zn, thus avoiding potential toxic effects of this micronutrient  <cit> . additionally, these three transporters restore zn uptake in the yeast zn-uptake mutant, Δzrt1/Δzrt <dig> , confirming its implication in zn homeostasis  <cit> . moreover, zip <dig> and zip <dig> can rescue yeast mutants deficient in copper  transport, and zip <dig> is up-regulated in cu-deficient roots  <cit> . although several zip genes have been identified and functionally characterized at the molecular level  <cit> , the complete gene family and their role in metal homeostasis is not fully understood. in this way, a considerably large family of zip genes has been currently characterized from various species, such as thlaspi japonicum <cit> , thlaspi caerulescens <cit> , soybean  <cit> , medicago truncatula <cit>  and rice  <cit> . the availability of the full-genome sequence of grapevine  provides the opportunity to investigate the zn homeostasis and their importance for the reproductive development in this organism.  <dig> zip genes have been identified recently in vitis vinifera <cit> , but none of them has been functionally characterized.

here, we report the isolation of vvzip <dig>  a member of the zip gene family from vitis vinifera l. cv. carménère, which encodes a zn uptake protein. this gene was isolated from an expression library of carménère berries and is highly homologous to atzip <dig> gene from arabidopsis thaliana. expression of vvzip <dig> in the yeast zn-uptake deficient mutant zhy <dig> complemented its growth defect, indicating that vvzip <dig> has the function of a putative zn transporter. moreover, the expression of the vvzip3-mgfp <dig> fusion protein in onion epidermal cells indicated that is located at the plasma membrane. expression analysis revealed that vvzip <dig> was transcribed principally in reproductive tissues - specifically in developing flowers -, organs that also present the highest accumulation of zn. these results suggest that vvzip <dig> participates in zn uptake during flower development contributing to the normal development in vitis vinifera l.

RESULTS
vvzip <dig> is a member of a zn transporter encoding gene family
in a previous preliminary study, a macroarray containing approximately  <dig> ests from grapevine reproductive tissue expression libraries was screened to compare the transcriptomic profiles of normal and seedless berries from carménère cultivar  <cit> . a gene coding for a protein similar to a metal transporter from medicago truncatula was found to be strongly repressed in seedless berries . the corresponding full length cdna was isolated from an expression library of carménère berries and its sequence was subjected to different in silico analyses for further characterization. when compared with the zip genes identified in the grapevine genome  <cit>  the isolated gene was found to correspond to vvzip <dig>  sequence analysis and comparison of the cdna with genomic dna shows that vvzip <dig> is composed of three exons and two introns, being a single copy gene located in chromosome i of grapevine . a phylogenetic tree was obtained compiling vvzip <dig> protein with other sequences of known arabidopsis thaliana and the recently identified vitis vinifera l. zip members . this association revealed that vvzip <dig> is closely related to atzip <dig>  atzip <dig> and atzip <dig>  three characterized zn transporters in arabidopsis <cit> .

vvzip <dig> is differentially expressed during grapevine development
as a first approximation to determine the expression profile of vvzip <dig> and its relevance during the development of vitis vinifera l. cv. carménère, relative expression level was measured by qpcr and compared with other representative zip genes identified in the grapevine genome  <cit> . based on clusters determined in the phylogenetic comparison , vvzip <dig> vvzip2vvzip4vvzip <dig> vvzip <dig> vvzip8vvzip <dig>  and vvzip <dig> were selected for this analysis. total rna was isolated from roots, leaves, stems, little clusters, flowers, fruits and seeds at different developmental stages  during the s <dig> growing period, covering important events such as flower and berry development. this analysis reveal that vvzip <dig>  is mainly expressed in leaves during the vegetative development  but its expression decay during early stages of the reproductive development, being up-regulated again at pre-veraison  and veraison  stages but to a lesser extent than in leaves . on the other hand, vvzip <dig> presented a differential expression profile in both vegetative and reproductive tissues, characterized for a high expression during reproductive development. while in vegetative tissues the expression prevailed mainly in stems and at low levels in roots and leaves, in reproductive tissues vvzip <dig> was mainly expressed in little cluster and flowers, with a significant up regulation  in flowers. contrary to this, reduction of the vvzip <dig> transcripts was evident in berries as maturation stages progressed , suggesting that vvzip <dig> could be important during the early stages of the reproductive development in vitis vinifera l. other members of vvzip family analyzed shown a low expression level except for vvzip <dig>  that is induced as berry maturation stages progressed .

vvzip <dig> protein has conserved motifs associated to zn transporters
blast search on the translated protein sequence indicated strong homology with several members of the zip family from arabidopsis thaliana as well as with other zn and iron  transporters . multiple alignments of the translated sequence with homologous proteins showed that vvzip <dig> encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acid residues . in agreement with the structure of other zip protein family members, principally atzip <dig> , zip <dig> and zip <dig> from fragaria x ananasa , gmzip <dig> , ptzip <dig>  and mtzip <dig> , vvzip <dig> was predicted to contain eight transmembrane  domains, a very short c-terminal tail, and a hydrophilic region between tm domains iii and iv, being this the most variable region in length and containing a potential metal-binding domain rich in histidine residues . this region was predicted to be directed toward the inside surface of the membrane. further analyses with the wolf psort-ii software  <cit>   showed that vvzip <dig> is predicted to be a plasma membrane protein with a potential signal peptide in the first  <dig> residues . the cellular localization assigned by in silico analysis was experimentally tested. vvzip <dig> cdna fused to the n-terminal coding part of the modified green fluorescent protein  <dig>  was transiently expressed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus  35 s promoter in onion epidermal cells. the fluorescence of the vvzip3-mgfp <dig> fusion protein was observed at the plasma membrane , while that of mgfp <dig> alone was localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus , suggesting that vvzip <dig> is a transporter protein located at the plasma membrane.

vvzip <dig> restores zn-limited growth in the yeast zhy <dig> double mutant strain
to support the role of vvzip <dig> as a zn uptake transporter, the yeast mutant zhy <dig>  <cit>  defective in zn uptake, due to the inactivation of both its high - and low -affinity zn transporters, was used in a complementation experiment. zhy <dig> cells transformed with the empty pyes <dig> expression vector were able to grow on synthetically defined medium only when supplemented with zn  . however, zhy <dig> transformed with the pyes <dig> expression vector containing the vvzip <dig> cdna  grew well on media supplemented with both low  and high zn . the wild type parental yeast strain dy <dig> also developed on media with both low and high zn concentrations . these results indicate that vvzip <dig> complemented the mutations of zhy <dig>  apparently by transporting zn across the yeast plasma membrane.

vvzip <dig> is mainly expressed in the pericarp and skin of berries and is related to normal fruit development
a more detailed analysis of the transcriptional profile of vvzip <dig> along fruit development showed that the expression level during berry growth was significant lower than that in early stages of reproductive development  and appears to be restricted to the pericarp and skin tissues since a very low transcriptional activity was detected in seeds .

in field conditions, zn deficiency is commonly associated to the production of clusters with few berries that vary in size from normal seeded to very small or parthenocarpic unseeded berries, a viticulture problem known as millerandage <cit> . in order to test whether vvzip <dig> expression is being affected in such phenotype, its transcriptional profile was compared in normal and parthenocarpic grapes in an early developmental stage  from three different seasons . this analysis revealed that expression of vvzip <dig> was consistently repressed in parthenocarpic green berries compared to normal berries in the three growing seasons analyzed . taken together, these results suggest that vvzip <dig> is mainly expressed when the plant needs high requirement of zn  and that its expression is associated with the physiological processes that affect the normal berry development in grapevine.

zn accumulation in reproductive tissue of vitis vinifera l. cv. carménère is associated to vvzip <dig> expression profiles
to examine whether the zn content profiles correlate with the expression of vvzip <dig> on the same season and to determine the profiles of accumulation of this metal during reproductive development, the concentration of zn was measured in little clusters, flowers and fruits from season s <dig> . as expected, there was a significant increase of zn levels in flowers, about two-fold compared to those in little clusters. this observation suggests that vvzip <dig> plays a relevant role in zn transport during flower development. after flowering stage, the reduction in zn content was evident as maturation stages progressed. additionally, parthenocarpic berries showed reduced zn content when compared with normal berries before the maturation stage. these results seems to be consistent with the vvzip <dig> expression profile , however, and since at least two other members of the grapevine zip gene family are also expressed during berry development , the putative role of vvzip <dig> in zn-uptake in these tissues need to be further analyzed.

the expression of vvzip <dig> is induced by zn in normal berries
to test if the vvzip <dig> expression is zn-dependant in reproductive tissues, normal berries at pre-veraison stage were exposed to zn treatment. to reproduce in planta situation, exogenous zn2+ was added by generating a capillary ion flux to the sink tissues through the berry peduncle . after  <dig> hours of treatment, expression of vvzip <dig> was up-regulated about  <dig>  fold compared to no-treated berries and this up-regulation was maintained until the end of the experiment , while the negative control gene, vvwrky- <dig>  which encodes a putative zinc-finger transcription factor expressed in grapevine leaves , showed no alteration in its transcriptional level, along this treatment . this result suggests that the zinc flow to reproductive organs promotes its accumulation in these tissues by inducing vvzip <dig> expression.

discussion
although several zip genes have been characterized in plants  <cit> , to date, no zip gene has been isolated for vitis species. the zip family of metal transporters shares several characteristics, including a molecular size between  <dig> and 39 kda,  <dig> trans-membrane domains, a cytoplasmic ‘variable region’ localized between transmembrane domains  <dig> and  <dig> that provides a potential metal-binding domain and carboxy and amino termini located on the outer side of the targeted membrane  <cit> . indeed, vvzip <dig> displays all these structural characteristics allowing to be considered as a member of the zip family .

as shown in the phylogenetic tree , the predicted amino acid sequence of vvzip <dig> was most closely related to atzip <dig>  atzip <dig> and atzip <dig>  from a. thaliana <cit>  indicating that vvzip <dig> and those proteins share, probably, a common evolutionary ancestor. all of these proteins are able to complement the growth of the yeast strain zhy <dig>  this yeast mutant type is very sensitive to zn deprivation because of the mutation of their both high - and low -affinity zn uptake systems  <cit> . similar to the arabidopsis zip proteins, the grape zip protein encoded by the cdna of vvzip <dig> complemented the growth of this yeast mutant . moreover, vvzip <dig> was localized to the plasma membrane, as shown by the wolf-psort ii prediction and transient expression of a vvzip3-mgfp <dig> fusion protein in onion epidermal cells . hence, these findings demonstrate that vvzip <dig> gene encodes a putative zn transporter that may participate in the uptake of this element in vitis vinifera l..

the tissue-specific expression determined for grapevine zip encoding genes reflects the complexity of this gene family and suggests a differential gene regulation associated to the nutritional requirements of grapevine. in this regard, several zip genes identified in other species display diverse transcriptional profiles regarding tissue specificity and response to zn status. for example, in rice, oszip <dig> mrna accumulates in the phloem cells of the stem as well as in the vascular bundles of the roots and leaves  <cit> , oszip <dig> mrna accumulates in zn-deficient roots and shoots while oszip <dig> mrna accumulates primarily in zn-deficient roots  <cit> . in the model legume medicago truncatulamtzip <dig> transcripts were only detected in zn-deficient roots and leaves  <cit> , while mtzip <dig> gene was expressed in roots and stems, but not in leaves, and its transcriptional activity could be induced by zn  <cit> . in addition, the vvzip <dig> counterparts identified in arabidopsis  show a strong transcriptional activity in root tissue under zn deficiency  <cit> . compared to other vvzip genes , vvzip <dig> is mainly transcribed in grapevine reproductive tissues under field conditions, more specifically in developing flowers and in the pericarp and/or skin of berries at early growth stages . in these tissues, vvzip <dig> expression seems to be induced in response to zn exposure as deduced from the experiments with normal berries at pre-veraison stage under exogenous zn treatment .

in addition, and even when vvzip <dig> is not expressed in seeds, its transcriptional activity was consistently repressed in parthenocarpic non-seeded berries . this down-regulation is not due to a non-specific disruptive effect on gene expression caused by seedlessness. when non-seeded/seeded expression ratio was determined for several transporter encoding genes both, up-regulated and down-regulated genes were identified . interestingly, such analysis revealed that a gene coding for a putative grapevine boron transporter also appears strongly repressed in non-seeded berries. like zn, boron is also an essential micronutrient required for normal reproductive development in plants, and b deficiency has been associated to parthenocarpic berry development in grapevines  <cit> . similar to vvzip3vvbor <dig> is predominantly expressed in flowers at anthesis and normal berries at early growth stages, preceding a b accumulation in reproductive tissues  <cit> . this expression profile seems adequate to fulfill the b requirement for cross-linking of rhamnogalacturonane ii, a polysaccharide essential for cell wall formation during pollen tube growth  <cit> .

in a similar way, the vvzip <dig> expression profile, its straight correlation with the zn accumulation pattern during development of reproductive organs , and it’s up-regulation in response to an increase in vascular zn content , suggests a participation of vvzip <dig> in the zn loading during early reproductive developmental stages. it has been reported that alteration of the expression of zip transporters affects zn distribution. recently, it has been demonstrated that constitutive over-expression of the oszip <dig> gene in transgenic rice plants confers disarrangement of zn distribution in the transgenic plants  <cit> . in these regard, we can speculate that the alteration of vvzip <dig> expression during flowering and fertilization can modify the distribution, remobilization and availability of zn, and hence affects normal reproductive development. considering that zn is essential for the stabilization of many proteins involved in development such as proteins containing dna-binding zn-finger motifs, ring fingers and lim domains  <cit>  and that zn-finger transcription factors have been involved in the development and function of floral tissues such as anthers, tapetum, pollen and pistil secretory tissues in several plant species  <cit> , it is plausible to propose that vvzip <dig> may play a key role in both flower and normal fruit development.

CONCLUSIONS
considering that zn deficiency produces several developmental problems in grapevines  <cit>  and that no information is available regarding the specificity, regulation and function of any zip gene in vitis vinifera l., this work provides relevant information about the functional characterization of a putative zn transporter identified in this species. using a functional molecular approach, our results suggest that vvzip <dig> encodes a plasma membrane putative zn transporter protein member of the zip gene family. vvzip <dig> is principally expressed in reproductive tissues, being strongly repressed in parthenocarpic seedless berries that present lower zinc accumulation, suggesting that it may participate in zn uploading for normal berry development and that changes in its expression could affect zinc availability during this process.
