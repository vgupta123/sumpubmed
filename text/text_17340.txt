BACKGROUND
cultivated potato is the world’s third most important human food crop and the number one non-grain food commodity . unfortunately, potato is also host of a broad range of pathogens  <cit> . late blight disease is caused by phytophthora infestans, resulted in the irish potato famine in the 1840s, and still today results in multi-billion dollar losses worldwide annually. p. infestans is a notorious plant destroyer with the capacity to attack both potato foliage and tubers. foliage resistance against late blight does not guarantee tuber resistance—contrasting disease resistance phenotypes can be evident in comparing foliage and tubers from a single genotype  <cit> .

gene rb   <cit> , a disease resistance gene cloned from a wild potato species, confers broad-spectrum foliar resistance against all major late blight pathogen isolates. the gene has been introduced into several potato cultivars using transgenic approaches  <cit> . transgenic lines have been or are currently being tested for eventual commercial release in europe, india, bangladesh, us and other places. halterman et al.  <cit>  reported that the four foliar late blight resistant +rb transgenic potato lines examined in their study lacked statistically significant tuber blight resistance. however, in a more extensive survey of +rb transgenic potato lines, we identified two transgenic lines with unusually high rb transcript levels that were late blight resistant in both foliage and tuber  <cit> . thus, rb has the potential to function in the tuber and the rb-potato tuber-p. infestans interaction provides a tractable system to study how potato tubers defend against plant pathogens.

next-generation sequencing  technologies are fast evolving and are transforming biology research  <cit> . genome sequences of potato and p. infestans have been published  <cit> , making sequencing-based transcriptome studies  more accessible to potato late blight researchers. rna-seq is a relatively new approach towards study of the transcriptome  <cit> . to our knowledge, there has been no rna-seq study focused on potato-microbe interactions. indeed, one ngs-based transcriptome study focused on the interaction between potato and p. infestans has been published  <cit> . however, that study utilized the deepsage method, not rna-seq. deepsage differs substantially from rna-seq and researchers in that study relied heavily on assembled tags; the newly available genome sequence data were mostly not utilized. furthermore, that and all other published studies focused on potato foliage transcriptome dynamics  <cit> ; no previous study has reported transcriptome dynamics of potato tubers in response to pathogen attack.

in this study, we employed rna-seq to study the transcriptome dynamics of potato tuber- p. infestans interactions in compatible and incompatible potato genotypes. we employed genome-wide sequence data from both potato and p. infestans in our analyses. differentially expressed genes and ontology bins were identified that distinguish compatible and incompatible interactions. transcripts of p. infestans, including those from candidate effectors, were also identified. our study has important implications for potato r gene deployment and contributes to scientific understanding of organ-specific defense regulation in plants.

RESULTS
the +rb transgenic line exhibits enhanced tuber late blight resistance
in previous field-based evaluations, the +rb line examined in this study, sp <dig>  was ranked as the third most foliar late blight resistant of  <dig> transgenic lines tested and was rated as “resistant” to foliar late blight  <cit> . in contrast, the wt line  was rated as “susceptible” to foliar late blight  <cit> . here, in replicated whole tuber assays performed six weeks after harvest, the +rb line showed no tuber late blight disease after normalization to the water-inoculated controls, whereas the wt line showed clear tuber late blight disease development . results from two sets of whole tuber experiments were in agreement . thus, while wt is susceptible to p. infestans infection in both foliage and tuber, the rb transgene renders the +rb line sp <dig> resistant to p. infestans infection in both foliage and tuber. rb gene transcription in the tubers of the +rb line was unaltered by inoculation with p. infestans at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hpi .

rna-seq reads aligned well with the potato reference genome sequence
a total of  <dig> rna samples, collected from three biological replicates of p. infestans- or water-inoculated tuber tissues of two potato genotypes  at three time points post inoculation, were subjected to rna-seq. approximately  <dig> million paired end reads were generated, yielding an average of  <dig>  million paired end reads per sample. a total of  <dig>  million illumina reads  passed quality filtering. the majority of reads  could be mapped uniquely to one location within the doubled monoploid  potato reference genome sequence  <cit>  . an additional  <dig>  million reads  were mapped to multiple locations within the reference genome sequence .

we detected transcription of  <dig>  potato genes based on cufflinks fpkm  information and gene models reported by the potato genome sequencing consortium   <cit> . wang et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that a data set of  <dig> million rna-seq reads represented about 80% of annotated chicken genes, concluding that rna-seq is a viable alternative to the microarray for transcriptome study. in this study, we detected more than 75% of pgsc potato gene models—a percentage similar to that reported by wang et al.  <cit> . this scale of gene detection is higher than reported for any previous potato-p. infestans transcriptome study. importantly,  <dig> % of rna-seq reads that passed quality filters were mapped to regions outside of the current potato reference genome gene models , suggesting further refinement of gene annotations associated with the potato reference genome sequence may be warranted. nonetheless, qrt-pcr results correlated well with rna-seq data with an average pearson correlation coefficient of r= <dig>  . together, our results suggest that rna-seq and qpcr approaches can be cross-validated, confirming that current potato gene models  <cit>  are appropriate for functional genomics studies of potato tubers.

overall transcriptome dynamics
a principal component analysis  of log <dig> transformed fpkm values for  <dig>  genes from the  <dig> rna-seq samples is shown in figure  <dig>  together, pc <dig> and pc <dig> explained >40% of the total variance of this dataset. samples collected at  <dig> hpi were distinct from all other samples, with pc <dig> providing clear separation of  <dig> hpi samples from  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi samples. pc <dig> also differentiates water- and p. infestans-inoculated samples at  <dig> hpi. overall, the distribution of +rb samples is similar to that of corresponding wt samples. these results indicate that time and treatments  play a greater role than genotype in defining overall transcriptome dynamics. this results is expected given that the +rb line was created by transformation of the wt line with the rb transgene.

differentially expressed  genes
we also identified  <dig>  genes that are differentially expressed  during at least one of the between time transitions in p. infestans-inoculated samples . transcriptome dynamics of both genotypes in p. infestans- compared to water-inoculated samples during transitions from  <dig> hpi to  <dig> hpi and from  <dig> hpi to  <dig> hpi were visualized using ma plots . interestingly, at later stages of infection , wt tubers exhibited mostly up-regulation of genes, whereas the +rb line displayed approximately equal numbers of up- and down-regulated genes , potentially reflecting contrasting rates of pathogen proliferation  and corresponding host response patterns.

transcriptome dynamics of between line comparisons were also visualized using ma plots . consistent with pca which shows that genotype has a lesser role  in defining overall transcriptome dynamics, fewer genes were determined to be de during between line comparisons, despite a trend of increasing numbers of de genes over time . this suggests that both the wt and the +rb line use that same set of genes to respond to p. infestans attack but that there are significant differences in the temporal regulation of these genes.

next we employed hierarchical clustering to visualize the de genes identified through between time point comparisons. despite a preponderance of shared de gene regulation patterns, groups of genes that distinguish compatible and incompatible interactions were still identified . these include wrky  and ethylene response  transcription factors. the erf <dig> transcription factor gene is a likely key element in the integration of ja  and et  signals for the regulation of defense responses  <cit> .

the +rb transgenic line has faster and stronger induction of de genes
a total of  <dig>  de genes were identified when water- and p. infestans-inoculated samples were compared  at the same time points . of these,  <dig> were de only in the +rb line,  <dig> were de only in the wt line, and  <dig> were de in both lines. we identified two representative hierarchical clusters, comprising a total of  <dig> genes, showing interesting regulation patterns at  <dig> hpi . in wt, these  <dig> genes were suppressed ; in +rb, these  <dig> genes were induced . these genes include ethylene response factors , cellulose synthase, chitinase, and elicitor inducible cytochrome p <dig>  two genes specifically associated with the hypersensitive response , pgsc0003dmg <dig>  and pgsc0003dmg <dig>  were significantly induced in the +rb line but not in the wt line at  <dig> hpi. it is important to highlight that the +rb line displayed  <dig> de genes at  <dig> hpi, accounting for about 82% of the total de genes identified during between treatment comparisons . these results suggest that the +rb line responds to p. infestans attack by rapid differential regulation of large sets of genes, whereas the wt line is slower to respond .

ontology bins and gene groups distinguishing compatible and incompatible interactions
mapman ontology enrichment analysis of de genes  revealed that wrky transcription factors are up-regulated in +rb but not in wt at  <dig> hpi. strikingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> de  wrky transcription factor genes show significant induction in the +rb line at  <dig> hpi . in contrast, none of the  <dig> wrky transcription factor genes showed statistically significant  induction in the wt line at  <dig> hpi. homologs of several of these wrky transcription factors have been previously reported to be involved in defense against phytophthora spp. and other pathogens  <cit> . we hypothesize that de wrky transcription factors identified in this study are downstream regulatory components of rb-mediated defenses in potato tubers.

very importantly, we discovered that when wt and +rb were compared directly, the +rb line displays stronger transcription of genes within receptor kinase and defense related bins, even at  <dig> hpi . it is especially relevant to note that many of the bins commonly associated with plant defense, including receptor kinases and pr  protein genes are more highly expressed in the +rb line. interestingly, wt actually has much higher transcription of similar defense-related bins at  <dig> hpi  if an indirect comparison  was made, indicating that wt and +rb probably share large sets of defense components. thus, wt responds to p. infestans by up-regulation of sets of defense response genes that are constitutively transcribed at higher levels in the +rb line even in the absence of the pathogen . but slower activation of defense related genes in wt is insufficient to prevent disease development, resulting in a tuber blight susceptible phenotype. these results were corroborated by an independent pilot rna-seq study  using field grown tubers of the same genotypes from a different year . collectively, these findings suggest that faster and stronger expression of defense related genes plays a role in enhanced disease resistance in the +rb line.

rna-seq reads mapping to phytophthora infestans reference transcripts
a total of  <dig>  paired end sequence reads were mapped to the p. infestans reference transcript set  <cit> , representing the transcription of over  <dig>  genes. ninety-six p. infestans transcripts are predicted to encode rxlr effectors  <cit> .

throughout the infection time course, a trend of increasing mappable p. infestans reads is evident for wt samples. this increase of mappable reads was not seen in the +rb line from  <dig> hpi to  <dig> hpi  and a majority  of all mapped reads originated from infected wt potato tuber samples collected at  <dig> hpi. this is in agreement with tuber late blight disease development observed in wt but not +rb tubers. in total, a majority of all p. infestans reads  were from infected wt potato tuber samples; less than 5% of the reads were from infected +rb potato tuber samples .

class i and ii ipio proteins, members of the rxlr family of putative effectors, induce avirulence responses in potato lines containing rb <cit> . after inoculation , class i ipio transcripts were detected  in five of six tuber samples collected from the p. infestans-inoculated wt line but from no samples derived from the +rb line . this is probably due to suppression of p. infestans proliferation in the +rb line.

discussion
faster and stronger activation of defense related genes, gene groups and ontology bins correlates with successful tuber defense
direct comparison between wt and +rb lines at  <dig> hpi revealed a total of  <dig> de genes . seven of the eleven de genes were more highly transcribed in +rb. these include carbonic anhydrase , aquaglyceroporin , cytochrome p <dig> , malic enzyme , and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase  . interestingly, these genes or homologs of these genes were previously reported to be involved in basal or pathogen-induced defense responses in plants  <cit> . the four remaining de genes  are transcribed at higher levels in wt than in the +rb line. each of these genes has also been associated with plant defense  <cit> . together, our results demonstrate that the +rb line differs from wt in the constitutive transcriptional regulation of defense related genes.

go enrichment analysis of de genes identified during between treatment comparisons  suggests that +rb has faster response to pathogen attack, as evidenced by higher and statistically significant induction of ontology bins commonly associated with plant defense  at  <dig> hpi. one notable example is wrky transcription factors , with  <dig> out of  <dig> wrky transcription factors significantly induced in +rb. these same transcription factors are also induced, but at nonsignificant levels, in the wt line, documenting that more potent and rapid activation of defense related genes, rather than novel resistance responses per se, might play a role in enhanced tuber resistance in the +rb line.

furthermore, when a more holistic approach  was employed to identify differentially regulated ontology bins, various defense related ontology bins were discovered . +rb potato tubers displayed faster and stronger transcription of genes within bins commonly associated with plant defense such as receptor kinases and pathogenesis-related  genes . together, these results suggest that the +rb line is tuber late blight resistant due to faster and stronger activation of defense related components.

cao et al.  <cit>  found that increased transcription of the rice xa <dig> resistance gene correlated with enhanced expression of defense-responsive genes and an enlarged resistance spectrum to xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae . previously we demonstrated that higher transgene rb copy numbers correlated with both higher rb transcript levels and enhanced late blight resistance in the foliage  <cit> . the +rb line employed in this study, sp <dig>  displayed the highest tuber transgene transcription levels among  <dig> transgenic lines examined  <cit> . thus, the unusually high levels of rb gene transcription in the tubers of sp <dig> correlates with faster and stronger activation of defense related components . the faster and stronger up-regulation of these defense-related components very likely contributed to the observed successful defense against p. infestans  in this line. one interesting observation is that wt actually has much higher transcription of similar defense-related bins at  <dig> hpi  in indirect  comparisons. collectively, our data support a model of tuber blight resistance resulting as a function of faster and stronger expression of defense related genes due to high rb transcript levels.

hr is likely a general form of resistance to p. infestans, even in potato tubers
prevailing scientific thought suggests that the phyllosphere frequently encounters biotrophic or hemibiotrophic pathogens, against which the hr is effective. in contrast, roots are more likely to encounter necrotrophic microbes that would theoretically benefit from the hr  <cit> . consistently, working in arabidopsis, hermanns et al.  <cit>  showed that hr is present in above ground incompatible host-pathogen interactions, but absent during the same host-pathogen interaction in the roots—despite r gene transcription in both leaves and roots. these authors concluded that r gene function is modulated in an organ-specific but mechanistically poorly defined manner for the purpose of suppressing hr in the roots. observations of differential late blight resistance levels in potato foliage and tubers within a single genotype  <cit>  suggest that r gene function in potato may also be modulated in an organ-specific manner. but the potato tuber, although it develops below ground, is a modified stem, not a root. previous studies  <cit>  have suggested that hr plays a role in tuber defense. the identification of sp <dig>  a +rb transgenic line with both foliar and tuber late blight resistance provided opportunity to examine the role of hr in defending non-root organs against pathogen attack.

p. infestans is a hemibiotrophic pathogen and kamoun et al.  <cit>  argued that hr is likely a general form of resistance against phytophthora pathogens. in agreement, chen and halterman  <cit>  demonstrated that rb triggers an hr in potato foliage challenged with p. infestans. in examining rb-mediated tuber responses to p. infestans, we identified de genes associated with the hr  that are highly up-regulated in pathogen-inoculated tuber samples of sp <dig> compared to water-inoculated tuber samples at  <dig> hpi. previous studies have shown that the pepper homolog of hir is a positive regulator of hypersensitive cell death  <cit> . qi et al.  <cit>  also demonstrated that the nbs-lrr protein rps <dig> forms complexes with athir proteins in arabidopsis and tobacco plants, providing mechanistic insight into r protein function and the hr. we hypothesize that rb and hir might form similar complexes in potato, a topic that warrants further experimentation. rapid production of reactive oxygen species by plants is a hallmark of pathogen recognition and correlates with the hr. working with disks cut from potato tubers that carry the r <dig> late blight resistance gene, doke  <cit>  demonstrated that incompatible but not compatible races of p. infestans triggered production of reactive oxygen species. in our study, a gene  encoding respiratory burst oxidase homolog protein b  was induced   <dig>  fold in the +rb line but not in the wt line 48 hours after p. infestans-inoculation. this gene is known to be involved in the massive phase ii oxidative burst induced in potato by pathogen infection  <cit>  and offers further support that rb-mediated resistance to tuber late blight likely entails an hr or hr-like phenomenon.

interestingly, hr is commonly associated with sa  mediated responses. but our ontology bin analysis didn’t reveal sa metabolism as a differentiating factor for the tuber blight resistant and susceptible lines. instead, our study reveals that the et  bin is predominantly associated with the incompatible interaction. leon-reyes et al.  <cit>  reported that the antagonistic relationship between sa and ja  <cit>  only exists when there is no strong production of et. nunez-pastrana et al.  <cit>  reported that ethylene but neither sa nor methyl ja  induces resistance response against phytophthora capsici in pepper. extensive hormonal crosstalk  <cit>  during plant responses to pathogens is a topic of extensive ongoing research and future results will likely yield new insights that will allow fine-tuning of our understanding of potato tuber-pathogen interactions and organ-specific defense responses in plants.

CONCLUSIONS
we presented the first rna-seq  study focused on potato tuber responses to pathogen attack. we mapped approximately  <dig> million rna-seq reads onto the recently published potato reference genome sequence, documenting the utility of rna-seq for biological study of tetraploid cultivated potato. we identified sets of de genes that distinguish resistant and susceptible lines. our data suggest that potent regulation of defense genes and gene groups or ontology bins  plays a role in rb-mediated tuber defense. in particular, faster and stronger expression of defense related genes correlates with enhanced tuber blight resistance in the +rb transgenic line. in agreement with kamoun et al.  <cit>  and doke  <cit> , our data suggest that hr is likely a general form of resistance against late blight even in the potato tuber, an organ that develops below ground.
