BACKGROUND
breast cancer is a complex disease and although recent research has emphasized the heterogeneity of the disease, much of its biology remains poorly understood. in particular, genomic tools such as dna microarrays hold great potential for the deciphering of the molecular patterns of tumors and the identification of new and improved clinical markers. gene expression profiling has been used extensively over the last few years to analyze breast tumors and has resulted in several gene signatures associated with different clinical parameters  <cit> . using an unsupervised approach, we have identified five clinically relevant subtypes of breast tumors  <cit> , which have been further validated in independent data sets  <cit> . of these, the two main subtypes are associated with the most significant difference in clinical outcome: patients with luminal a type tumors are facing a relatively good prognosis, whereas patients with basal-like tumors experience a much shorter overall-and disease-free survival period  <cit> . they are also associated with differences in pathologic response to chemotherapy  <cit> .

our earlier findings suggested that the distinct expression patterns of the tumor subtypes and the significant differences in disease outcome are likely to be caused, at least in part, by alterations in specific cellular pathways and/or different cell type origin. the luminal a type tumors are characterized by high expression of the estrogen receptor  and a handful of other genes generally co-expressed with esr <dig>  many of which are genes typically expressed in the luminal epithelium that lines the ducts. the basal-like tumors on the other hand, are characterized by high expression of some basal epithelial markers such as krt <dig>  krt <dig> and lamc <dig> , and many cell cycle-regulated genes  <cit> . a more thorough characterization of the molecular basis underlying these subtypes, in particular in breast carcinomas at an earlier stage, will help us to better understand breast cancer diseases at cellular levels and hopefully provide new molecular prognostic markers and targets for therapy.

in this study, we profiled  <dig> samples from early breast carcinomas  using three different microarray platforms to address the question of uniformity of the breast cancer phenotypes with different technologies. we identified differentially expressed genes between the two main tumor subtypes, luminal a and basal-like, and subjected these to protein classification and pathway analyses. finally, we identified a minimum set of genes with the best possible predictive power for an expression-based prognostic assay for the two clinically relevant subtypes of breast cancer.

RESULTS
identification and validation of tumor subtypes in early breast cancer
our first approach for identifying the previously described tumor subtypes was to correlate the expression patterns of the  <dig> early stage breast carcinomas analyzed by applied biosystems expression array system with the previously published expression centroids of the five tumors subtypes  <cit> . the correlation matrix summarized as a heat map is shown in figure 1a. the previously identified subtypes were evident also in this small tumor set. using a correlation coefficient cutoff of  <dig> , six tumors were defined as basal-like, seven were luminal a, three tumors were erbb2+, one luminal b and finally, one was identified as normal breast-like. two tumors remained unclassified using the  <dig>  threshold.

unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the  <dig> tumors using the  <dig> mapped intrinsic genes identified three sub-clusters of samples based on their expression patterns . individual dendrogram branches are colored according to the strongest correlation of the corresponding tumor with a subtype centroid. among these sub-groups, the clearest distinction was observed between the luminal a  and the basal-like  subtypes, as has been repeatedly reported.

as a second approach to validate the tumor subtypes in this data set, we applied a supervised analysis using "nearest shrunken centroid classifier" and the pam software. we took the previously published  <dig> norway/stanford data set  <cit>  and the mapped  <dig> genes as the training set to identify predictor genes for the five subtypes. with a threshold  of  <dig> and 10-fold cross validation, we built a classifier containing  <dig> genes which gave < 5% misclassification error . we then used this classifier to predict the subtypes of the  <dig> tumors analyzed in this study. the prediction results from the supervised analysis were overall consistent with the unsupervised analysis using hierarchical clustering and centroid correlation analysis:  <dig> tumors were predicted to be basal-like,  <dig> tumors were predicted to be luminal a,  <dig> were determined as erbb2+,  <dig> as luminal b, and  <dig> was unclassifiable . in other words, all but one sample were assigned to a subtype with high prediction probability; however, it is worth to note that the prediction accuracy may be over-estimated as the predictor genes are a subset of those used to define the subtypes in the first place.

confirmation of the luminal a and basal-like subtypes using different array platforms
we also analyzed the same  <dig> tumor samples on stanford human cdna microarrays and agilent whole human genome oligo microarrays. centroid correlation analysis was performed as described above using the  <dig> common intrinsic genes mapped among all three platforms. unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the three data sets revealed the exact same subgroups of tumors, with the luminal a and the basal-like subtypes as the most predominant and distinct . pam analysis showed consistent prediction of subtype for each tumor sample from the three data sets except for two samples . overall, there was consistency in identifying these biological subtypes between all three platforms.

molecular characterization of luminal a and basal-like subtypes of breast tumors
to molecularly characterize these two subtypes, we first identified the most differentially expressed genes as the "signature" genes using data from the applied biosystems expression arrays, as this system provides a comprehensive coverage of the genome including genes not covered by other commercial microarrays. anova analysis coupled with benjamini and hochberg false discovery rate multiple testing corrections were performed on six luminal a samples and six basal-like tumor samples .  <dig> genes represented by  <dig> probes were identified as the "signature" genes meeting the following criteria:  detectable  in > 50% samples;  > 2-fold change between the two subtypes, and  false discovery rate < 5% . figure  <dig> displays a hierarchical clustering diagram of the  <dig> tumor samples using these  <dig> signature genes. among the signature genes,  <dig> probes  were specifically over-expressed in luminal a type tumors , which included some previously identified markers, such as esr <dig>  gata <dig> and liv <dig>  <cit> , as well as many other potential marker genes for this subtype. one example is the emp <dig> gene, which encodes a tetra-span membrane protein that has been reported to suppress b-cell lymphoma tumorigenicity  <cit> . in the basal-like tumors,  <dig> probes  were specifically over-expressed , and these included markers such as krt <dig>  the lamin b receptor  and dsc <dig>  two interesting genes specifically overexpressed in these tumors were mras, a well known oncoprotein of the ras superfamily whose mutant forms may transform mammary epithelial cells  <cit> , and cdca <dig>  a direct target of the myc oncogene  <cit> .

to depict more detailed molecular portraits of these two subtypes, we analyzed which biological processes were over-represented by these signature genes using the panther™ protein classification system analysis. the most significantly over-represented biological processes are listed in table  <dig> . not surprisingly, very different processes are underlined by the signature genes of the two subtypes: for luminal a, the most over-represented biological processes  include fatty acid metabolism  and steroid hormone mediated signaling , whereas for the basal-like subtype, the most over-enriched processes  include ones that involve many cancer "hallmark" genes, such as the cell cycle, cell proliferation and differentiation, protein phosphorylation, b-cell-and antibody-mediated immunity.

upper part: the most significant biological processes  over-represented by the luminal a subtype and the basal-like subtype ; lower part: the most significant cellular pathways  over-represented by the luminal a subtype and the basal-like subtype .

in a similar fashion, we also analyzed which cellular pathways played critical roles for defining the two distinct subtypes using jubilant's pathart™ database. table  <dig>  shows the top five pathart™ pathways over-represented  by the genes characteristic for luminal a and the basal-like subtypes, respectively. again, quite distinct pathways were found to underlie the two subtypes of breast tumors. as expected, the most over-represented pathway activated in the luminal a subtype is the er signaling pathway :  <dig> genes within the er signaling pathway were significantly up-regulated in these tumors, including the estrogen receptor  <dig>  and the estrogen-induced gene trefoil factor  <dig> . this is consistent with the previous findings that the luminal a type tumors over-express esr <dig> and other estrogen-responsive genes and therefore are responsive to adjuvant hormonal treatment  <cit> . on the other hand, the biological pathways underlying the basal-like subtype are well known cancer-associated pathways. for example, fifteen genes in the p <dig>  pathway were coordinately over-expressed in the basal-like tumors, many of these, such as mcm <dig>  mcm <dig>  mcm <dig> and mad2l <dig> play critical roles in cell proliferation and dna replication . among many genes in this pathway, skp <dig> was found over-expressed in basal-like tumors; it encodes a protein involved in the degradation of another cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p <dig>  and recently reported to be over-expressed in many tumor types and to correlate with poor prognosis  <cit> .

our findings confirm the existence of the intrinsic tumor subtypes in these early breast cancer specimens, as has been reported by others  <cit>  and indicate that the cellular processes revealed by gene expression profiling have been programmed at earlier stages of tumorigenesis.

identification of the best set of prognostic genes discriminating the luminal a and basal-like subtypes of breast tumors
in an effort to identify a minimal set of genes that best characterize the two subtypes and can form the basis for a prognostic gene profile, we performed anova analysis on the data sets generated on each of the three array platforms using the  <dig>  common genes  and the same six luminal a and six basal-like tumor samples. differentially expressed genes between the two subtypes were determined for each platform using the same criteria:  > 2-fold change between the two subtypes, and  false discovery rate < 5%. from these,  <dig> genes were identified as the common signature genes . the combined data sets generated from the three platforms using expression data from these  <dig> common genes was then used as the training set to perform pam analysis for the identification of the minimal set of genes to best discriminate luminal a and basal-like tumors. ten-fold cross validation and a threshold of Δ =  <dig>  identified  <dig> genes with a misclassification error of ~  <dig> %. the genes are listed in additional file  <dig>  principle component analysis on the  <dig> tumor samples profiled on all three array platforms using these  <dig> genes clearly separated the two subtypes of breast tumors .

real-time pcr validation using taqman® gene expression assays
to further validate these prognostic markers, we selected altogether  <dig> genes  and  <dig> selected g-protein coupled receptors  and secreted proteins) and performed real-time pcr using taqman® gene expression assays . profile correlation analysis showed that the expression profiles across the  <dig> tumor samples determined by each array platform and by taqman® assays are highly correlated   varied from 81–88% for the three array platforms . hierarchical clustering analysis not only demonstrated excellent separation of the luminal a and basal-like subtypes, but that the same tumor sample analyzed by three microarray platforms and the taqman® assays were clustered together by tumor sample rather than by method .

discussion
analyses of gene expression patterns from thousands of genes using dna microarrays have demonstrated great diversity among tumors arising in the same organ and with apparently similar histopathology. this has raised hopes that classification schemes based on molecular profiling may better capture the complex behavior of tumors and lead to improved prognostication and tailor-made therapeutic strategies. we were the first to identify that specific subclasses of breast cancer, based on gene expression profiling, were distinct biological entities and associated with significant differences in outcome for patients with locally advanced breast cancer  <cit> . subsequently, this has been validated both by us and other groups in different types of breast cancer patient cohorts  <cit> . here, we could confirm the existence of the molecular subtypes of breast tumors also in early breast cancer  using three different microarray platforms. due to the small sample size reported here, only the luminal a and basal-like groups could be robustly identified, although the other less represented subtypes could also be recognized. these two subtypes are easily distinguishable in several tumor data sets and their expression profiles seem to be anti-correlated, as also has been shown for breast cancer cell lines  <cit> , but the cellular pathways affected are not known in detail. we show here that the differences in gene expression patterns between the two main subtypes reflect levels of activation of distinct signaling pathways. these changes might have been pre-programmed already at a relatively early stage in the progression of the cancer and hence, imply that the fate of the tumor is already set. this is in accordance with previous reports on breast cancer  <cit> . other groups have analyzed gene expression in dcis  for comparison with invasive carcinomas and highlighted transcripts that may be important for transformation and invasion  <cit> . extensive studies of dcis and other pre-invasive stages of tumors will further enlighten this hypothesis and substantiate the value of gene expression-based classification in prognosis of breast cancer at an early stage.

specifically in this study, a more in-depth molecular characterization of these phenotypes of breast cancer was carried out and provided new insights into the biology of the disease at the molecular level. the distinct and characteristic molecular mechanisms revealed by the protein classification and biological pathway analysis, provided further evidence that these molecular subtypes represent biologically distinct disease entities and may require different therapeutic strategies. for example, our results indicated that the luminal a subtype showed coordinated activation of genes involved in steroid/estrogen signaling and fatty acid metabolism. fatty acid synthase -dependent endogenous fatty acid synthetic activity has been found to be abnormally elevated in a subset of aggressive breast carcinomas  <cit> , in particular erbb2-overexpressing tumors  <cit> , whereas here, high expression of many genes involved in fatty acid/lipid metabolism and degradation were coupled to the luminal a phenotype, know to be associated with a relatively good prognosis  <cit> . although no correlation between fatty acid metabolism and estrogen and progesterone receptor expression status of tumors has been documented in cancer, our results may indicate some level of cross-talk between fatty acid metabolism and steroid signaling that may have effects on apoptosis and cell proliferation and possibly hormonal treatment in this subtype of breast cancer. indeed, it has been speculated that some lipids may modulate steroid metabolism  <cit> .

such molecular profiling of clinically relevant subtypes of breast tumors provide opportunities for identification of novel targets that can be exploited for targeted therapeutics of the disease. among the  <dig> genes most differentially expressed between luminal a and basal-like tumors,  <dig> are secreted proteins based on the prediction methodology published in a recent paper  <cit> . a variety of biomolecules are secreted proteins such as cytokines, chemokines, hormones and digestive enzymes that play pivotal biological regulatory roles and are very important sources for protein therapeutics. we also identified five g protein-coupled receptors  among these signature genes, a gene family well established as small molecule drug targets.

although we analyzed only  <dig> tumor biopsies, data were collected using three different microarray platforms; a two-color fluorescent-based cdna microarray, a 60-mer oligo microarray using two-color fluorescence detection and a 60-mer oligo microarray using chemiluminescence detection. of  <dig>  common genes among these three platforms,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively, were identified to be differentially expressed between luminal a and basal-like tumors. of these,  <dig> genes were common to all three technologies, which correspond to an overall consistency of 30%. these numbers could prove to be even higher if a more accurate probe match by sequence rather than gene identifiers would be performed, as has recently been shown  <cit> . a few studies have recently been published that aimed to compare variability and consistency between microarray platforms and with different results  <cit> . our study shows that although there is variability between the platforms, the gene expression profiles emerging from using all three technologies are highly correlated to the biological variation in the data and the same tumor subtype pattern was identified with all three methods.

the minimal set of  <dig> genes that best characterized luminal a and basal-like subtypes was identified based on differential expressed genes on all three platforms and validated by using taqman® assays. convincingly, clustering of expression data from all four methods grouped the experiments together by tumor sample of origin and not by platform. hence, these genes provide a robust set of potential prognostic molecular markers, but which covers only the two main subtypes. more thorough characterization on significantly larger sample sizes is needed to provide prognostic predictor sets for all subtypes.

CONCLUSIONS
we have validated and characterized the two main previously defined clinically relevant subtypes, luminal a and basal-like, in early stage breast carcinomas, using three different dna microarray platforms. signature gene profiles characterizing these two subtypes revealed that distinct molecular mechanisms might have been pre-programmed at an earlier stage in different subtypes of the disease. our results provide further evidence that these breast tumor subtypes represent biologically distinct disease entities and may require different therapeutic strategies. finally, validated by the gene expression platforms and taqman® assay-based real time pcr, the set of  <dig> predictor genes identified in this study defines a set of highly-validated and potential prognostic molecular markers for these subtypes of breast cancer.
