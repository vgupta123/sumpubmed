BACKGROUND
systematic and quantitative studies of adverse side effects have become increasingly important due to rising concerns about the cytotoxicity of drugs in development  <cit> . according to the us food and drug administration , up to 90% of all experimental drug compounds going through clinical trials fail to gain fda approvals due to problems such in efficacy, formulation, pharmacokinetics , toxicology, or clinical safety. in the past decade, concerns over drug toxicity have risen significantly , while concerns over drug efficacy have remained unchanged  and concerns over drug pk have decreased significantly . it is time for drug developers to design new and accurate models to assess unwanted side effects and drug actions before costly human clinical trials.

recent research on the adverse side effects   <cit>  of drugs in cells has drawn attention to the inadequacy of the traditional "one drug, one target, and causal effect" model. modern drugs are designed to regulate the functions of specific target proteins, or "drug targets". efficacious drugs can break through human barriers of absorption, discretion, metabolism, and excretion to achieve desirable "on-target" effects. however, drugs may also bind to "off-target" proteins, potentially leading to unwanted side effects or adrs, which range from mild drowsiness to deadly cardiotoxicity  <cit> . more appropriate models must be developed to take advantage of complex molecular responses of drugs in cells, by exploiting fully the relationships between chemical compounds, protein targets, and side effects observed at the physiological level  <cit> . the recent emergence of a systems approach to drug discovery has revitalized research in these areas of study  <cit> . by integrating the studies of human molecular networks, chemical compound similarity networks, and protein-drug association networks, systems biology researchers have spurred the development of systems pharmacology   <cit>  <cit> . by analyzing biological molecules and chemical entities in a variety of functional network contexts, drug developers can understand how drugs functions in a complex molecular system model  <cit> , predict drug safety issues early  <cit> , identify adr events early  <cit> , and design diagnostic tests for tailoring drug treatments to individuals  <cit> .

although the importance between systems biology and adr had been recognized before, there had been no published report about how to practically predict adr from molecular annotation data until this study  <cit> . mutsumi fukuzaki et al. used cooperative pathways and gene expression profiles to predict adrs  <cit> . nonetheless, large-scale validations and performances were not mentioned. based on the concept of adr similarity analysis  <cit> , nir atias et al. applied canonical correlation analysis and a network-based diffusion to predict adrs  <cit> , with prediction precision at merely less than  <dig> . chemical structure-based approaches, also mentioned in nir atias' research, were used to predict off-targets  <cit>  and adrs  <cit> . while andreas bender et al. illustrated that this type of approach is quite sensitive in predicting adr, the positive predictive value is generally quite low, averaging under  <dig>   <cit> . moreover, protein-protein interaction  networks were not employed for predicting adverse drug interactions until lucas brouwers et al. presented the contribution of ppi networks to drug side-effect similarities  <cit> ; however, the prediction precision was too low  to be of practical significance.

in this work, we propose a computational systems pharmacology framework consisting of statistical modeling and machine learning to predict adr of drugs. our framework is based on comprehensive integration of systems biology data, including drugs, protein targets, molecular annotation, and reported side effects. the contribution of our work is the following: first, drug-target interactions are expanded in global human ppi networks to build drug target expanding ppi networks. second, drug targets are enriched by their gene ontology  annotations to build drug target expanding go networks. third, adr information for each drug is combined with drug target expanding ppi networks and drug target expanding go networks. fourth, statistics and machine learning are applied to build adr classification/prediction models. fifth, cross validation and feature selection are used to train prediction models. without losing generality, we applied the framework to predict heart-related adrs , which are leading causes for clinical drug withdrawals  <cit> . the results of the cardiotoxicity prediction case study show that the performance of our approach  is significantly better than all previously-reported studies. the positive contribution of ppi networks  and the go annotations  for drug cardiotoxicity prediction are also quantified for the first time.

RESULTS
we report adr prediction methods with cardiotoxicity as a case study. there are many adrs related to cardiotoxicity, according to the index of the international classification of diseases 10th revision   <cit> . we merge all adrs, each of which has an index ranging from i <dig> to i <dig> , into one group, sh. the adrs related to cardiotoxicity in sider and their icd- <dig> indices are listed in table  <dig>  in the adr vs. drug target  facts , if any one of dsnh is  <dig>  where dn is drug n, and sh is in the group of heart-related adr , then dsnh is set to 1; otherwise, dsnh is set to  <dig>  the mathematical details are described in the methods.

we evaluated the performance of adr predictions in multiple experiments by applying standard statistical performance-evaluation measures, i.e., auc , acc , sen , and spe . for each evaluation experiment, we repeated 10-fold cross validation three times and took median values to report prediction performances. to assess whether and how ppi networks  or go annotations  may contribute to a drug's cardiotoxicity-related adr, we obtained results as described below.

use of biomolecular functional network data improves drug adr predictions
we examined drug adr prediction performance by integrating different sets of confidence-ranked ppi data derived from the happi database  <cit> . the database contains comprehensive human functional and physical protein interaction/association data, at different confidence levels, from " <dig> star"  to " <dig> star" .

we can observe significant contributions of ppi networks to both prediction models, as shown in figure  <dig>  when svm  is applied, the performance prediction goes up from auc =  <dig>   to auc =  <dig>  . the use of ppi data bring up prediction performances significantly, i.e., accuracy =  <dig> , sensitivity =  <dig> , and specificity =  <dig> . the increased auc of the " <dig> stars up" condition over the "no net" condition is very significant, with p-value =  <dig> e- <dig> based on the t-test. if one further includes the lowest confidence level  into the drug target expanding network, the prediction performance decreases slightly due to noise in molecular networks. the performance curve of logistic regression  is comparable to, yet systematically lower than, that of svm, moving up from auc =  <dig>   to auc =  <dig>  . the performance of " <dig> stars up" ppi network data is lower than that of " <dig> stars up" ppi network data, at accuracy =  <dig> , sensitivity =  <dig>  and specificity =  <dig> . the increased auc of the " <dig> stars up" condition over the "no net" condition is also very significant, with p-value =  <dig> e- <dig> based on the t-test. however, the decreased auc performance between " <dig> stars up" condition over the " <dig> stars up" condition is also noticeable, likely due to the functional nature  of biomolecular networks at the " <dig> stars" level reported by the happi database.

in order to control for the effects of using any types of  biomolecular networks and their possible contributions to adr predictions, we also tested the model's performance with the use of randomized ppi networks which shared the same network topologies as actual ppi networks. figure  <dig> shows that the performance curves using random networks slightly increased , when svm  and logistic regression  were applied. this result occurs because the original relationships between drugs and drug targets are still retained in the simulated random ppi networks. the additional gained prediction power, however, can only be explained by the embedded useful network information that our prediction model automatically learned from real biological network structures. these results strongly suggest that the contribution of ppi network data to drug adr prediction is primarily due to useful functional information embedded in biomolecular functional association networks of drug targets and their related proteins, whereas network topology alone only plays a peripheral role.

we also studied whether the increase in our model's prediction performance may be due to the increase in the total number of features when ppi network data are introduced. for this purpose, we focus on the result obtained from the use of " <dig> stars" ppi network data, in which the number of features obtained by the prediction models becomes much smaller than that without using any network information. we noted that the auc of this experimental result is better than that without using any network information . to further confirm the relationship between the number of features captured in the model and the model performance, we performed another experiment in which we gradually decreased feature number " <dig> stars up" ppi data in the svm prediction model by lowering feature selection thresholds. figure  <dig> showed that there is no significant  decrease of prediction performances, when the number of features is filtered down. these observations further support our original finding that the contribution of ppi network for a drug's adr prediction performance primarily comes from network data themselves.

integration of go annotations also improves drug adr predictions
we also examined drug adr prediction performance by integrating go annotations available for each drug's protein targets. in two experiments , we directly incorporated into our prediction models go annotation labels of drug target proteins. since each protein-coding gene may be annotated by many go terms from different go hierarchical levels, we carefully designed experiments to eliminate potential adr prediction performance biases due to non-uniformity of go term hierarchical levels. therefore, we show in figure  <dig> how go terms aggregated to different go hierarchical levels can contribute to prediction results based on different thresholds, the number of go terms satisfying each threshold, and the number of go terms selected into each model. since go hierarchical level =  <dig> is not biologically meaningful and there is insufficient data for go hierarchical levels from  <dig> to  <dig>  results for these categories are not shown.

in the first experiment ), the go terms equal to or deeper than specified threshold go hierarchical levels are used to annotate drug targets for comparative drug adr prediction performance analysis. our results suggest that the prediction performances with the use of go terms, regardless which predictive modeling method is used and which criteria is used for comparisons, are always better than those without the use of go terms. in particular, when go term level  <dig>  is chosen, a best performance can be achieved with the use of svm, in which we observed auc =  <dig>  and sensitivity =  <dig> ; in comparison, "no net"  has auc =  <dig> . the improvement in overall adr prediction performance defined by auc is significant .

in the second experiment ), the go terms deeper than level n are replaced by their level n go term ancestors to annotate drug targets for comparative drug adr prediction performance analysis. we call this process a "roll up" and observed similar results as in the first experiment. in particular, when go term lv <dig> is chosen, a best performance can be achieved with the use of svm, in which we observed auc =  <dig>  and sensitivity =  <dig> . the improvement in overall adr prediction performance defined by auc over the "no net" experiment is also determined to be statistically significant .

based on the above two experiments using go terms, we can make the following conclusions. first, the use of go annotations can help improve a drug's overall adr prediction performance. drug adr prediction performances achieved with the best use of go annotation  are almost comparable to those achieved with the best use of ppi networks . second, svm models can help achieve better performance than logistic regression model can based on our case studies. third, to achieve the best adr prediction performance, it is best to choose svm models and use go biological process categorical terms at sufficiently detailed term levels  to annotate drug targets. fourth, by evaluating detailed prediction performances achieved with ppi networks  and go annotations , we discovered that integration of biomolecular network data can increase the specificity  of adr predictions, while the integration of go annotation data can increase the sensitivity  of adr predictions.

a good adr prediction model is concentrated not only on drug targets implicated with the adr events, but also on many non-target proteins directly linked to adr mechanisms
we examined further the biological network contexts for  <dig> proteins selected automatically by the svm prediction model as features. we expanded these "seed proteins" with " <dig> stars up" ppi interactions to build a ppi interaction network using the nearest neighborhood expansion method  <cit> . in figure  <dig>  we used node color and counts  to show how much evidence from pubmed might be identified in each protein.

many selected proteins were found to have close relationships to cardiotoxicity. for example, adrb <dig>  mediates hormone epinephrine and neurotransmitter norepinephrine. the polymorphisms of adrb <dig> have been shown to be involved in drug cardiotoxicity in heart failure  <cit> . autoantibodies against the beta-1-adrenergic receptor have also been shown to have idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in some patients  <cit> . therefore, it gives us great comfort that adrb <dig> as a known drug target is also a part of the predictor.

we also observed that the drug target expanding network can bring forth additional cardiotoxicity-related non-target proteins, e.g., erbb <dig> and cyp2d <dig>  erbb <dig>  a v-erb-a erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog  <dig>  is a member of the type i receptor tyrosine kinase subfamily and encodes a receptor for ndf/heregulin. targeted deletion and inhibition of erbb <dig> signaling may lead to congestive heart failure resulting from cardiovascular defects  <cit> . cyp2d <dig> encodes a subunit of the cytochrome p <dig> superfamily of enzymes. the gene is specifically expressed in the right ventricle and its genetic polymorphism is known to be associated with cardiotoxicity, including a patient's poor anti-arrhythmic activity, severe cardiovascular, or dilated cardiomyopathy  <cit> .

using all go annotations from go term level  <dig> "rollups" to build predictors with the svm model, we developed a final list of  <dig> go terms selected into the best cardiotoxicity prediction model ). in table  <dig>  we list the  <dig> go terms and their ids. interestingly, many of these terms appear to be related to heart disease or cardiotoxicity. there are many known literature reports linking these terms to cardiotoxicity. for example, avkiran et al.  <cit>  described the mapkkk signaling cascades in heart failure; yatani et al.  <cit>  showed g proteins' roles in heart rate regulation; plunkett et al.  <cit>  examined the role of dopamine receptor on the cardiovascular system; the go terms of go: <dig> and go: <dig> are defined as the terms related to regulation of heart contraction; go: <dig> is involved in the regulation of calcium ion transport, a critical process in cardiovascular functions; gosalvez et al.  <cit>  showed evidence of the link between potassium transport and cardiotoxicity; and so on. apparently, the prediction model works by integrating biologically significant drug targets within known cardiovascular side effects and the related non-target protein functional partners implied in cardiovascular functions or cardiotoxicity.

discussion
in this work, we not only built effective adr prediction models, but also showed that the use of biomolecular networks or gene annotations may independently improve adr prediction performances. integrating gene network and gene annotation allows the use of deeper level of biological knowledge  <cit>  to increase a model's prediction performance. in future work, it would be preferable to study functional relationships between proteins that are not directly associated. additional experimentally-based genotype-phenotype information, e.g., those derived from genome-wide association studies, may also be useful, as several recent studies of genetic polymorphisms of cardiotoxicity-inducing enzymes have already showed  <cit> .

we developed a general conceptual framework and demonstrated how to build practical adr prediction models, using cardiotoxicity as a case study. for other drug adr predictions, hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity are also critical issues to consider in drug development. decision trees were developed and trained by others to predict hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity  <cit> , relying on a drug's chemical properties to predict adrs. therefore, we plan to soon assess hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in a future extension of this work and compare our performances with those of other approaches.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we presented a systems pharmacology framework for predicting drugs' adr, using cardiotoxicity as an example. our method is based on svm and logistic regressions, by integrating adr information, drug-target data, ppi networks, and go term annotations. our results indicated that integrating functional biomolecular association networks or detailed go annotation could significantly improve a drug's adr prediction. particularly, comprehensive functional biomolecular association networks are shown to be useful for increasing specificity, while detailed gene annotation information are shown to be useful for increasing sensitivity. moreover, proteins used to automatically build the prediction models are shown to further reveal related biological functions for cardiovascular health and cardiotoxicity. overall, our study described a novel way of predicting adrs, with comprehensive incorporation of additional prior knowledge adr assessments.
