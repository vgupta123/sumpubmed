BACKGROUND
galactosylceramide  is the most abundant sphingolipid of mammalian myelin  <cit> . it is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum by udp-galactose:ceramide galactosyltransferase . in the golgi apparatus, part of the galcer is sulfated by cerebroside sulfotransferase , forming sulfatide  <cit>  . in the absence of a functional cgt gene, compact myelin can be formed, which is, however, unstable and cgt-/- mice develop tremors and ataxia at  <dig> to  <dig> weeks of age  <cit> . this phenotype could be explained by disturbed axon-glial contacts at the paranodes in the cns caused by mistargeting of essential adhesion molecules, nf- <dig> and caspr  <cit> . at least in part, these structural alterations are caused by the loss of sulfatide rather than galcer, as demonstrated by a similar alteration of the paranodal region in gal3st1-deficient mice, which lack sulfatide but have normal galcer levels  <cit> . however, myelin appear to be more stable in gal3st1-deficient mice, suggesting additional, yet less defined roles of galcer in myelin  <cit> .

in cgt-/- mice, the loss of galcer and sulfatide is accompanied by a significant upregulation of 2-hydroxylated fatty acid-containing  glucosylceramide  and hfa-sphingomyelin  <cit> . interestingly, there are no indications for presence of hfa-gangliosides or other higher glycosylated hfa-sphingolipids in the brain of cgt-/- mice  <cit> . the presence of hfa-glccer and hfa-sphingomyelin was interpreted as a compensatory upregulation, which may also  functionally replace hfa-galcer, enabling cgt-/- mice to form compact myelin  <cit> .

hfa-sphingolipids in cns and pns myelin are synthesized from 2-hydroxylated fatty acids, formed by the fatty acid 2-hydroxylase   <cit> . although loss of 2-hydroxylated sphingolipids in myelin does not affect initial myelin formation, it causes late onset  axon and myelin sheath degeneration  <cit> . fa2h-deficiency was identified as the cause of a new leukodystrophy with spastic paraparesis  <cit> , and hereditary spastic paraplegia spg <dig>  <cit> , respectively.

in order to test the hypothesis that the presence of hfa-glccer and hfa-sphingomyelin in cgt-/- mice is a functional important compensatory upregulation, preventing a more severe phenotype, we generated cgt-/- mice with an additional deficiency in the fa2h gene. our analysis shows that the additional deletion of fa2h does not obviously affect the phenotype of cgt-/- mice. this suggests that hfa-glccer and hfa-sphingomyelin do not functionally compensate the loss of hfa-galcer in cgt-/- mice.

RESULTS
generation of fa2h-/-/cgt-/- double deficient mice
in order to test the hypothesis that hfa-glccer partially compensates the loss of hfa-galcer in cgt-/- mice and thereby prevents a more severe phenotype, we generated cgt-/- mice with an additional deficiency in fa2h. as shown previously, young fa2h-/- mice form structural and functional normal myelin  <cit>  and did not show behavioral abnormalities that would indicate myelin deficiency. older fa2h-/-, however, developed a progressive axonal degeneration in peripheral nerves and brainstem, accompanied by myelin sheath degeneration  <cit> . as shown before  <cit> , cgt-/- mice had a strongly reduced life span, whereas fa2h-/- mice did not show increased mortality . survival of fa2h-/-/cgt-/- double deficient mice was not significant different from cgt-/- mice . there were no obvious behavioral differences between the two genotypes. however, because of the low amount of age-/weight- and gender-matched 4-week-old cgt-/- and fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice available, extensive behavioral testing could not be performed, and thus minor behavioral differences between cgt-/- and fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice cannot be ruled out. the following biochemical and morphological analyses were done with mice at  <dig> weeks of age.

glccer levels are reduced in cns and pns of fa2h-/-/cgt-/-mice when compared to cgt-/- mice
tlc analysis of total brain lipids from wild-type, fa2h-/-, cgt-/- and fa2h-/-/cgt-/-mice showed significant levels of hfa-glccer in cgt-/-mice, in line with earlier reports  <cit> . unexpectedly, nfa-glccer levels in total brain of fa2h-/-/cgt-/-mice were strongly reduced compared to hfa-glccer levels in cgt-/- mice . presence of nfa-glccer in fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice was better visible when the amount of lipids from these mice loaded was increased 4-fold compared to controls . a similar reduction in glccer levels was seen when sphingolipids of purified cns myelin were examined . densitometry revealed a reduction of nfa-glccer by more than 80% compared to hfa-glccer levels in cgt-/-mice . analysis of peripheral nerves  revealed a reduction of glccer in fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice by about 60% compared to cgt-/-mice . maldi-tof mass spectrometry of hexosylceramides from cgt-/- and fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice  demonstrated that cerebrosides in both genotypes mainly contained very long chain fatty acyl  residues . the tlc analysis also revealed a strong increase in the very-long chain fatty acid -containing sphingomyelin  in fa2h-/-/cgt-/-, but also in fa2h-/-/cgt+/- mice, when compared to cgt-/- and wild-type mice . densitometry confirmed a 2-fold increase of sphingomyelin in cns myelin of fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice compared to wild-type controls  . the increase of sphingomyelin in the pns was about 50% in fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice .

in line with data published by bosio et al.  <cit> , hfa-ceramide was detectable in cgt-/- mice but not in mice of other genotypes . however, in contrast to the 18-day-old cgt-/- mice analyzed by saadat et al.  <cit> , we did not observe a strong increase of ceramide in 4-week-old cgt-/- mice compared to wild-type controls. this might be due to the different ages examined.

to examine the possibility that glccer was replaced by gangliosides in myelin of fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice, gangliosides were isolated and analyzed by tlc. although the total amount of gangliosides in the myelin fraction of fa2h-/-/cgt-/- and cgt-/- mice was increased compared to wild-type, the major myelin ganglioside gm <dig> was unchanged and only gangliosides normally found in neuronal membranes  were increased . most likely these gangliosides are derived from neuronal membranes and possibly reflect a higher proportion of neuronal membrane contaminations in the cgt-/- and fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice, with their significant reduced amounts of compact myelin. in line with this, saadat et al.  <cit>  showed a similar relative composition of major gangliosides in myelin preparation from mice deficient in ugcg in myelinating cells. we therefore believe that myelin ganglioside levels in fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice were not increased compared to cgt-/- mice or wild-type controls. in summary, we conclude that hfa-glccer present in cgt-/- cns myelin was replaced by only low amounts of nfa-glccer but larger amounts of nfa-sphingomyelin in fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice. taken together, these results indicate that myelin hexosylceramides were mainly replaced by sphingomyelin in the absence of fa2h expression. it should be noted that the increase of sphingomyelin and the decrease of hexosylceramides were more pronounced in cns myelin than in the pns. this might indicate differences between oligodendrocytes and schwann cells in the trafficking or metabolism of sphingolipids.

myelination in fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice as compared to cgt-/- mice
myelin content in the brain of cgt-/-, fa2h-/-/cgt-/-, and wild-type mice was examined by western blot analysis of myelin basic protein  and by gravimetry of purified compact myelin. at the examined time point , mbp levels were reduced in cgt-/- mice compared to wild-type controls , in agreement with our previous observations  <cit> . a comparable reduction of mbp was found in fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice. accordingly, the amount of compact myelin isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation was significant reduced in both, fa2h-/-/cgt-/- and cgt-/- mice, compared to wild-type controls , but there was no significant difference between the first two genotypes.

absence of galcer and hfa-sphingolipids does not affect stability of chaps-insoluble membrane fractions
compact myelin of wild-type mice is stable against extraction with the detergent chaps at low  <cit>  and high temperature  <cit> . data by simons et al.  <cit>  suggest that loss of hfa-galcer in cgt-/- mice affects the association of the myelin proteolipid protein  with chaps-insoluble membrane fractions , suggesting a role for galcer in the formation or stabilization of cimf. we have recently shown that the absence of hfa-sphingolipids does not affect stability of myelin cimf  <cit> . however, in order to examine a possible synergistic effect of fa2h and cgt deficiency, purified myelin of fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice was subjected to chaps extraction at 37°c. optiprep gradient centrifugations were performed and the fractions were examined for sphingolipid content, as described  <cit> . these experiments showed that myelin was resistant to chaps extraction irrespective of the genotype . therefore, we conclude that neither galcer nor hfa-sphingolipids are essential for stabilization of cimf.

comparable myelination in fa2h-/-/cgt-/- and cgt-/- mice
to evaluate the extent of myelin sheaths thickness, cross sections were obtained from the cervical spinal cord of 4-week-old mice. on each side of the midline, starting at the deep medial boundary of the ventral funiculus and extending ventrally and laterally, fibers of all calibers were included. in this unbiased sampling approach, the number of myelinated axons was unchanged in cgt-/- and fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice . only few axons in both mouse mutants displayed no myelin at this postnatal stage . the mean axon diameter did not differ significantly between cgt-/- and fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice . the axons of fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice recruit inappropriately thick myelin relative to their absolute calibers resulting in an average myelin thickness of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm versus  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm in cgt-/-  . however, due to the relative small difference in myelin thickness, the g-ratios did not differ significantly between the two genotypes . furthermore, electron microscopy of myelinated axons revealed normal compact myelin in fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice . these results demonstrate that a compact myelin sheath can be generated in the absence of galcer and any 2-hydroxylated sphingolipids.

no obvious structural differences between oligodendrocytes of fa2h-/-/cgt-/- and cgt-/- were observed by the histological or electron microscopic analyses, however, a detailed structural analysis was not performed, and therefore we cannot exclude subtle structural changes in fa2h-/-/cgt-/- when compared to cgt-/- mice .

discussion
although hfa-sphingolipids appear to be dispensable for the formation of compact myelin  <cit> , they are essential for long-term myelin maintenance and may also play a role in glia-dependent axonal support. in the absence of galcer in cgt-/- mice, compact myelin can be formed  <cit> , which is, however, unstable, also suggesting a role of galcer in myelin maintenance. we hypothesized that hfa-sphingolipids may also play a more subtle role in early postnatal development, which could be detectable on a cgt-/- background, where compact but less stable myelin is formed. however, we did not observe signs of a more severe phenotype in fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice compared to cgt-/- mice. at the behavioral level, cgt-/- and fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice were indistinguishable. though there was a shift towards thicker myelin in fa2h-/-/cgt-/- compared to cgt-/- mice, the g-ratios did not differ significantly between cgt-/- and fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice. furthermore, myelin from fa2h-/-/cgt-/- and cgt-/- mice was resistant towards extraction with chaps, as shown before for fa2h-/- and wild-type mice  <cit> .

unexpectedly, hfa-glccer present in cgt-/- mice was replaced by only low amounts of nfa-glccer in fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice but higher levels of nfa-sphingomyelin. this suggests that the glccer concentration in myelin is not critical and furthermore that elevated glccer levels in cgt-/- mice do not functionally compensate loss of galcer. accordingly, saadat et al.  <cit>  showed that deleting oligodendroglial glucosylceramide synthase  in cgt-/- mice did not reinforce the myelin phenotype. this demonstrates that upregulation of -glccer in cgt-/- mice does not functionally compensate loss of galcer in these mice. in ugcg-deficient cgt-/- mice, hfa-glccer was partially replaced by hfa-sphingomyelin  <cit> . our results demonstrate that hfa-sphingomyelin can be replaced by nfa-sphingomyelin without any obvious effect on the phenotype of cgt-/- mice. thus, the significant up-regulation of hfa-sphingomyelin in cgt-/- mice is not a functional compensation.

the reason for the much lower nfa-glccer level in cns myelin of fa2h-/-/cgt-/- mice compared to the hfa-glccer level in cgt-/- mice is currently unknown. one possible explanation for the high hfa-glccer level and absence of hfa-gangliosides  <cit>  in cgt-/- mice could be the inability of the responsible glycosyltransferases to use hfa-glccer as a substrate. however, presence of a high amount of hfa-gangliosides in other tissues  <cit>  and in tumor cells  <cit>  argues against this. an alternative explanation could be differential sorting of hfa- and nfa-glccer, as shown for polarized epithelial cell lines  <cit> , or reduced half-life of hfa-sphingolipids.

although structural changes at the paranodes of cgt-/- mice are clearly caused by sulfatide rather than galcer deficiency  <cit> , myelin appear to be much more stable in young adult gal3st1-deficient mice, whereas myelin maintenance is already affected in young cgt-/- mice  <cit> , indicating additional function roles of hfa- and/or nfa-galcer. taken together, our results and those of saadat et al.  <cit>  strongly suggest that the upregulation of hfa-glccer and hfa-sphingomyelin in cgt-/- mice does not functionally compensate the loss of hfa-galcer in these mice. this, however, does not exclude the possibility that galcer could be functionally replaced by glccer, if the latter would be present at higher concentrations than in cgt-/- mice. the hfa-glccer concentration in cgt-/- mice is clearly below the concentration of hfa-galcer in wild-type but also in heterozygous cgt+/- mice . there might be a relatively high threshold of hexosylceramide concentration in myelin to efficiently fulfill its role in myelin maintenance. this possibility could be tested using transgenic mice overexpressing ugcg under control of an oligodendrocyte specific promoter, which to our knowledge are not available yet. alternatively, the functional role of hfa- and/or nfa-galcer may not be taken over by glccer or other glycolipids.

CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate that compact myelin can be formed with non-hydroxylated sphingomyelin as the predominant sphingolipid, though myelin maintenance is impaired. while the specific role of galcer in myelin maintenance remains mysterious, our results suggest that the presence of hfa-glccer and hfa-sphingomyelin in cgt-/- mice does not functionally compensate the loss of hfa-galcer.
