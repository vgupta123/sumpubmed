BACKGROUND
scorpion venoms produce a large variety of peptide toxins that target ion channels  <cit> . especially, the widespread use of scorpion-venom peptides acting on k+-channels as neuroscience tools and excellent ligand models has tremendously increased our knowledge in many fields, including exploration of the 3-dimensional structures and elucidation of the pharmacological characteristics of k+ channels  <cit> . in addition, peptide toxins are increasingly recognized as valuable sources of new drugs for channelopathies  <cit> . although natural toxins often lack sufficient efficacy and specificity toward an individual channel type, most peptide toxins adopt a cysteine-stabilized α/β scaffold; thus, they could serve as good candidates for further structure-based drug design  <cit> . however, crystal structures for many medically important potassium channels have not been determined, which makes the rational designing of k+-channel modulators difficult. therefore, applying computational methods to model reasonably stable structures of channel-peptide toxin complexes could be a good alternative, which would greatly help to highlight the diversity of channel-toxin interactions and provide structural information for toxin-based drug design.

the intermediate-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels  act as positive modulators of cell proliferation by hyperpolarizing the cell membrane in t and b cells, fibroblasts, and vascular smooth muscle cells  <cit> . furthermore, blocking of ikca channels has been shown to be a potential therapeutic strategy against autoimmune disorders involving these tissues  <cit> . however, almost all the peptidic and small molecular ikca blockers could not discriminate well between the ikca channel and other related kv-family channels and, thus, lack the specificity needed for further drug development  <cit> .

maurotoxin , a peptide derived from the venom of the scorpion scorpio maurus palmatus, is the most potent peptidic blocker of the ikca channel  <cit> . in addition, mtx could distinguish the ikca channel from the other calcium-activated channels and the kv1-family channels, except for the voltage-gated kv <dig>  channel  <cit> . interestingly, although the ikca channel is entirely different from the kv <dig>  channel in tissue contribution and physiological function  <cit> , mtx shows very similar pharmacological profiles in recognizing these two channels with approximately the same potency and using the same functional residues  <cit> . in this study, we aimed to interpret the differential binding mechanisms of mtx with reference to the ikca and kv <dig>  channels, which would provide a deep insight into the topological differences of these two channels and offer important clues for designing inhibitors that are more selective toward the therapeutic ikca channel.

combined computational methods were used to investigate the details of the interactions between mtx and the ikca channel; the structural details were further compared with the previous model of the mtx-kv <dig>  complex  <cit> . a stable structure of the mtx-ikca complex was obtained by using ligand docking, clustering analysis, and molecular dynamics simulation  methods. the validity of the final mtx-ikca complex was supported by good accordance between the computational alanine-scanning results and the experimental data. on comparison, although with similar pharmacological profiles, mtx adopted very different modes for associating with the ikca and the kv <dig>  channels. in both mtx-ikca and mtx-kv <dig>  complexes, mtx adopted the β-sheet domain as the interaction surface with the lys <dig> occluding the pore. however, the other key residue, tyr <dig>  was positioned quite differently in these two complexes. meanwhile, the turret region of the ikca channel played an important role in binding with mtx, which is different from the noninvolvement of the kv <dig>  turret during interaction with mtx. in addition, due to the different physicochemical profiles of the two channels, electrostatic and van der waals  interactions made different contributions to the free energies of binding in mtx-kv <dig>  and mtx-ikca complexes. all these structural and energetic discrepancies constitute the key determinants responsible for the binding specificity of mtx to the ikca and kv <dig>  channels, which could help design mtx derivatives that would discriminate between these two channels.

RESULTS
different mtx binding modes towards ikca and kv <dig>  channels
given the similar blocking activities that mtx showed toward ikca and kv <dig>  channels  <cit> , we first tested whether mtx recognized the ikca channel in the same binding mode as for the kv <dig>  channel. an mtx-ikca complex was modeled on the basis of the mtx-kv <dig>  complex structure  <cit>  using the distance-restraint homologous modeling method and then subjected to unrestrained mds to test its stability. previously, mtx adopted the β-sheet domain as the interacting surface, with lys <dig> occluding the pore of the kv <dig>  channel . and the most important residue, tyr <dig>  of mtx kept sticking into the pocket formed by residues on the turret and pore region of the kv <dig>  channel during the 8-ns production run  <cit>  . thus, the interaction between mtx and the kv <dig>  channel was beneficial for the stability of the turret region. on the contrary, in the mtx-ikca complex, in spite of starting from a similar conformation of sticking into the pocket formed by the turret and the pore region , the tyr <dig> was unwelcome in this position and gradually bent away from the "pocket" after 4-ns mds . therefore, the experimentally important residues, lys <dig> and tyr <dig>  failed to form strong interactions with the channel, and mtx deviated from the central position . as a result, the turret on the other side of the ikca channel failed to maintain stability and bent outward . obviously, this complex structure could not explain the experiment results at all. therefore, although mtx showed similar pharmacological profiles toward both kv <dig>  and ikca channels, it did not use the same binding mode in associating with these two channels.

mtx-ikca complex from docking and mds
we next applied a routine molecular docking and clustering analysis to screen plausible mtx-ikca complexes  <cit> . all the  <dig> nuclear magnetic resonance conformations of mtx with different side-chain positions were used in the zdock program, and  <dig>   <dig> complexes were generated in total.

the  <dig>   <dig> mtx-ikca complexes fell into four main binding modes, according to the orientation of the mtx β-sheet domain . as indicated in our previous study, the starting position of the residue tyr <dig> of mtx is essential for obtaining a final stable complex  <cit> . thus, we mapped all possible orientations of the aromatic ring of tyr <dig> in the four groups of complexes , including the following:  lying slantways over the linker connecting s <dig> and the selectivity filter of the ikca channel;  hanging between two subunits of the channel;  plugging the pore of the channel along with lys23;  hanging upright over the linker connecting s <dig> and the selectivity filter of the ikca channel. next, each of the candidates in the four binding modes was subjected to energy minimization, followed by 500-ps unrestrained mds, to introduce more flexibility and investigate the potential structural fluctuations. for better discrimination among the four binding modes, the alanine-scanning method in the mm-gbsa of amber- <dig> was applied for comparison of the computational and experimental data of functional residues . finally, an mtx-ikca model that best fit the experimental data was selected from the binding mode ii. to make it more equilibrated and stable, the selected mtx-ikca model was subjected to a further 10-ns unrestrained mds . according to the major transitions during the mds, we also evaluated the free energy convergence by sampling along the whole simulation . the results showed that both the peptide and the channel were induced to fit in their nanosecond-scale diffusional encounter, and then guided to form a specific stable complex.

to check the confidence of our mtx-ikca model, the ΔΔgbinding of eight single mutations of mtx were calculated and compared with the experimental data  <cit> . an overall high degree of correlation was found between the calculations and the experiments involving mutational effects . replacing the lys <dig> residue of mtx with alanine caused the most noticeable decrease of  <dig>  kcal/mol in the calculated binding energy, which is well in accordance with the experimental data of  <dig>  kcal/mol. substitution of another important residue, tyr <dig>  with alanine significantly reduced the mtx affinity by over  <dig> fold  <cit> , and the calculated ΔΔgbinding value of  <dig>  kcal/mol corresponded well with the experimental data of  <dig>  kcal/mol. however, mtx affinity for ikca was decreased by less than  <dig> fold by the s2a, t4a, s6a, k7a, y10a, and g33a mutants  <cit> . this is strongly supportive for the little change in binding energy when these residues were mutated to alanine; this is because ser <dig>  thr <dig>  ser <dig>  and lys <dig> were located at the n-terminal of mtx, whereas tyr <dig> was in the middle of the α-helix of mtx, all outside the interface of mtx.

consistent with the findings in previous docking experiments of mtx onto ikca channel  <cit> , in the final mtx-ikca complex, the peptide used its β-sheet as the interacting surface, with lys <dig> as a structurally conserved pore-blocking residue . this phenomenon was also observed when mtx associated with the kv <dig>  channel in both our study  <cit>  and the previous docking results by visan  <cit> . all these studies underline the key role of mtx β-sheet region in ikca and kv <dig>  channel recognition. interestingly, such importance is strongly supported by the previous experimental data that when substituting the β-sheet region of mtx with that of another toxin, hstx <dig>  its activity toward the two channels almost disappeared  <cit> .

despite that mtx used the β-sheet to interact with both ikca and kv <dig>  channels, when analyzing the conformation of other bioactive residues, the molecular information for the recognition of ikca by mtx showed several distinct features, compared to those for the kv <dig>  channel.

differential molecular information contained by tyr <dig> and lys <dig> in mtx
the mutant-cycle experiment showed that two major functional residues, namely, lys <dig> and tyr <dig>  in mtx block the ikca channel  <cit> . the key role of these residues can be shown by their structural conformation in the final mtx-ikca complex. although the pore-blocking characteristic of lys <dig> was common when mtx recognized both the ikca and the kv <dig>  channels, the conformation of tyr <dig> of mtx differed greatly in each of these contexts . as indicated in the second section, the residue tyr <dig> is essential for mtx-associating potassium channels, and its position was proposed to be the main factor determining the stability of the complex structure after a long-term unrestrained production run. in the final mtx-ikca complex, the favorable position for the residue tyr <dig> was lying on the linker connecting the selectivity filter and the s <dig> helix of the channel, forming strong polar and nonpolar interactions with gly <dig> , asp <dig> , val <dig> , and val <dig>  on the pore region of the channel . in comparison, the tyr <dig> in the mtx-kv <dig>  complex, however, differed significantly from that in the mtx-ikca complex by sticking into the pocket formed by arg <dig> and f <dig> on the turret and asp <dig>  met <dig>  val <dig>  and thr <dig> on the pore region of the kv <dig>  channel  <cit>  . thus, the differential chemical environment for tyr <dig> contributed greatly to the different binding modes of mtx when associating with the ikca and kv <dig>  channels.

in addition, rather than forming strong electrostatic interactions with the aspartic acid residues in the pore region of the channel, the side chain of the lys <dig> of mtx pointed to an opposite orientation from the ikca channel, contacting no residue of the channel within a 5-Å distance . this is different from the result of the mutant-cycle analysis that lys <dig> is situated near the asp <dig> of the ikca channel  <cit> . however, as the k7a mutation only affected the blocking activity of mtx by less than  <dig> fold  <cit> , it is possible that the lys <dig> just faced its alternative partner asp <dig> in the interface reorganization process, but does not contact asp <dig> directly in the final conformation. such a position of the lys <dig> while associating with the ikca channel differed significantly from that in the mtx-kv <dig>  complex, in which the lys <dig> formed strong polar interactions with the asp <dig> at the pore region of the channel  <cit>  . this distinctness was in consistence with the experimental data that the blocking activity of the mtx-k7a mutant decreased by about  <dig> fold in the case of the kv <dig>  channel, but decreased by only less than  <dig> fold in the case of the ikca channel  <cit> .

differential molecular information of other residues in mtx
considering that the β-sheets of mtx constitute its main channel-interacting surfaces, two other residues lys <dig> and lys <dig> were also found to play outstanding roles in the recognition process . in the model of the mtx-ikca complex, the lys <dig> mainly interacted with gly <dig>  and val <dig>  at the pore region of the ikca channel ; in addition, it also formed some electrostatic interactions with the backbone of asp <dig> . another basic residue lys <dig>  however, did not electrostatically interact with any acidic residues of the channel, but rather stuck into a pocket formed mostly by nonpolar residues, including thr <dig> and trp <dig> on the turret; and val <dig>  val <dig>  and pro <dig> on the linker connecting the s <dig> helix and the selectivity filter . such finding is completely in line with the previous docking result of mtx onto ikca channel  <cit> , which highlighted the important contribution of lys <dig> and lys <dig> in the interaction, due to their proximity to asp <dig>  val <dig> and asp <dig> of the channel.

however, these interaction modes mediated through lys <dig> and lys <dig> of the mtx in recognizing the ikca channel differed obviously from those involving mtx and the kv <dig>  channel, in which both lys <dig> and lys <dig> formed strong polar interactions with the channel  <cit> . within a contact distance of 5Å, the lys <dig> and lys <dig> of mtx, respectively, contacted closely with the conserved acidic residue, asp <dig>  in the pore region of the kv <dig>  channel and formed strong electrostatic interactions .

the different functional roles for the lys <dig> and lys <dig> of mtx when recognizing the ikca and the kv <dig>  channels could be further illustrated by calculating their mutation effects. as indicated in table  <dig>  either changing lys <dig> or lys <dig> of mtx into alanine resulted in a big change in the mtx-ikca and mtx-kv <dig>  interactive energies. however, in the model of the mtx-ikca complex, the changes in the vdw energies and electrostatic energies almost synergistically contributed to the large values of the altered interactive energies when replacing lys <dig> with alanine , in accordance with the observation that the lys <dig> of mtx mainly interacted with the nonpolar residues in ikca channel. in contrast, in the mtx-kv <dig>  complex, the increase in the interactive energies caused by mutating lys <dig> and lys <dig> were both dominantly constituted by the significant change in the electrostatic energies , resulting from the interacting residue pairs lys27-asp <dig> and lys30-asp <dig> .

distinct channel vestibules constitute different recognition modes toward maurotoxin
the α-ktx family of k+-channel blockers has been proved to function as informative molecular probes for the structure-function analysis of k+ channels. although the ikca and kv <dig>  channels have distinct tissue distributions and biophysical features  <cit> , both can be blocked by mtx with a similar pharmacology profile. thus, identifying the differential determinants that are responsible for the mtx binding of the ikca and kv <dig>  channels could help discover the different topologies of a mechanistically interesting part of these two channels: the outer vestibule of the ion-conduction pore.

sequence comparison showed that the ikca channel has a longer turret region than the kv <dig>  channel, and the sequence identity is rather low . these features were further shown by the structural analysis of unbound ikca and kv <dig>  channel vestibules , whereas the differential conformation of the channel turret suggested a different functional role for the channel vestibule during the toxin-recognition process. this hypothesis was supported by comparing our model of the ikca-mtx complex with the previous kv. <dig> -mtx model  <cit>  . we mapped all the toxin-interacting residues in the ikca channel turret  and found that the channel turret played an important role in stabilizing the final ikca-mtx complex. four residues, gln <dig>  ala <dig>  ala <dig>  and thr <dig> in the ikca turret formed polar and non-polar interactions with the corresponding residues of mtx. interactions have been found between gln <dig> of ikca and gly <dig>  pro <dig> of mtx, ala <dig> of ikca and pro <dig> of mtx, ala <dig> of ikca and val <dig>  thr <dig> of mtx, thr <dig> of ikca and lys <dig>  tyr <dig>  gly <dig> of mtx, respectively. thus, the important role of the ikca channel's turret in recognizing mtx is in sharp contrast with the almost nil involvement of the kv <dig>  channel turret, because only the tyr <dig> of mtx was able to contact the kv <dig>  turret within the distance of 5Å  and several mutations on the kv <dig>  channel turret hardly affected the binding affinity of mtx  <cit> . in addition, it is noticeable that the total net charge of the turret of the ikca channel is almost neutral, due to the average distribution of positive and negative residues in the turret . this is very different compared with the kv <dig> x family, all of which contained four extremely negative-charged turrets . actually, the ikca channel turret, with an important functional role and neutral charge, could well explain the equal contribution of electrostatic and vdw interactions in mediating the recognition process between the ikca channel and mtx , and the highly negative-charged kv <dig>  turrets are responsible for the dominance of electrostatic recognition in the binding of mtx to the kv <dig>  channel . all these data suggest that the diverse vestibules of the ikca and kv <dig>  channels, including the sequence length, sequence identity, vestibule conformation, and property of molecular surface jointly determine their different interaction modes.

CONCLUSIONS
through combined computational methods, including zdock, clustering analysis, and mds, a reasonably stable mtx-ikca complex structure was obtained. further study of this structure showed that in spite of sharing similar pharmacological profiles toward both ikca and kv <dig>  channels, mtx associated with the ikca channel in a quite different mode compared to that of mtx interacting with the kv <dig>  channel. in the bound complex, mtx assumed the β-sheet domain as the interaction surface with the lys <dig> occluding the pore of the ikca channel in a manner similar to its interaction with the kv <dig>  channel. however, the conformation of another key residue tyr <dig>  which was the key to the stability of the complex structure, differed greatly when mtx recognized the ikca channel, compared to the process with the kv <dig>  channel. it continued lying on the linker connecting the selectivity filter and the s <dig> helix of the ikca channel, forming strong polar and nonpolar interactions with residues on the pore region of the channel. in addition, the lys <dig> of mtx is possibly involved in the toxin-channel interface reorganization process; however, it does not contact any residues of the ikca channel directly in the final conformation. this is in contrast with the fact that the lys <dig> of mtx formed strong polar interactions with the asp <dig> at the pore region of the kv <dig>  channel. in addition, electrostatic and vdw interactions contributed equally to the binding of mtx with ikca, whereas the mtx-kv <dig>  association featured dominant electrostatic contribution. such conformational and energetic differences in recognition could be well explained by the different functional roles of the channel vestibules. the longer, neutral-charged ikca channel turret played an important role in stabilizing the final ikca-mtx complex, with four residues--gln <dig>  ala <dig>  ala <dig>  and thr <dig> forming polar and non-polar interactions with mtx. on the contrary, the shorter kv <dig> -channel turret is highly negatively charged and is barely involved in recognizing mtx. in all, the differences in the binding mechanisms of mtx toward the ikca and kv <dig>  channels unveiled in this study could offer a better understanding of the physicochemical properties and conformational distinctness of the two channels and thus give a hint for designing mtx-derived inhibitors to discriminate between these two channels.
