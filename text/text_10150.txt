BACKGROUND
interstitial cystitis is a chronic condition associated with inflammation of the lower urinary tract, which is more common in women and causes bladder symptoms  and pain that are poorly treated  <cit> . while there is considerable debate surrounding the diagnosis and etiology of interstitial cystitis, bladder tissues often show inflammation and ulceration  <cit> . during this period, it is likely that nociceptive c-fibers within the bladder wall become sensitised by neurotrophic factors and other inflammatory mediators  <cit> . like a number of other chronic pain states, symptoms associated with interstitial cystitis are more common in females and fluctuate during the menstrual cycle  <cit> . moreover, following ovariectomy, mice develop hyperalgesia and enhanced visceral sensitivity  <cit> . these observations raise the question of the mechanisms by which estrogens could be modulating pain and, more specifically, bladder pain.

neuroanatomical studies have identified estrogen receptors  and er mrna within many small- and medium-sized lumbosacral dorsal root ganglion  neurons  <cit> . evidence supporting a direct effect of estrogens on bladder nociception was provided by bennett and colleagues, showed that in adult female rat lumbosacral drg, erα and erβ are synthesised by more than half of the bladder-projecting neurons identified by retrograde tracer  <cit> . moreover, about one-third of these neurons express both ers and the nociceptive transducer, transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor  <dig> , providing a mechanism by which steroid modulation could directly affect bladder pain. more recently, an erβ-dependent effect of estradiol on nociceptor activity has been identified in adult female rat lumbosacral drg neurons, where overnight exposure to estradiol or erβ-agonist powerfully reduces the effects of capsaicin  <cit> . there is also a large body of evidence supporting rapid actions of estrogens within the nervous system , including the regulation of nociception and pelvic visceral pain. for example, in adult rat lumbosacral drg neurons, estradiol rapidly induces activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases , in turn leading to phosphorylation of camp response element binding protein   <cit> . creb has been strongly linked to neuronal plasticity including long term potentiation  <cit> , so could participate in sensitisation, as demonstrated in the dorsal horn  <cit> .

erk activation has been causally linked to the development of pain  <cit> , being elevated in nociceptor neurons and spinal cord after inflammatory stimuli and peripheral nerve trauma, including a model of acute visceral pain  <cit> . chronic visceral inflammation causes a prolonged increase in phosphorylated erk within the bladder tissues  <cit> . moreover, elevated levels of nerve growth factor  within the inflamed bladder  <cit>  and increased expression of neurotrophic factor receptors in bladder afferent neurons of rats with cystitis  <cit>  could provide a mechanism for mediating this effect on erk signalling. irrespective of the mechanism, an important role of mitogen-activated protein  kinases is indicated by studies showing that intravesical or intrathecal administration of mek inhibitors increases bladder capacity in rats with cystitis  <cit> . a second family of map kinases, the p <dig> map kinases, have been implicated in neuronal plasticity underlying development of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. this pathway can be activated by cytokines, leading to hyperexcitability and repetitive firing of nociceptors in drg. for example, tissue-derived ngf drives a p38-dependent expression of trpv <dig>  <cit>  and p <dig> causes phosphorylation and increased current density of the sodium channel, nav <dig>   <cit> . these actions have not yet been investigated in visceral nociceptors.

while estrogen has been proposed to affect neuroinflammation of the bladder by influencing ngf activity  <cit> , it is also possible that estrogens affect bladder pain by directly modulating signalling pathways within bladder sensory neurons. we have focused on lumbosacral drg neurons projecting to pelvic viscera  of adult female sprague-dawley rats and performed both in vitro and in vivo manipulations to address the following aims:  to determine if estradiol acutely modulates p <dig> signalling in vitro;  to investigate whether chronic estrogen deprivation in vivo  affects p <dig> or erk activity,  to determine if chronic bladder inflammation affects p <dig> or erk activity and  if prior ovariectomy attenuates or enhances any effects initiated by bladder inflammation. we identified distinct effects of acute and chronic estradiol manipulation on p <dig> map kinase in drgs. moreover, while inflammation and ovariectomy both caused some effects on map kinases, the nature of these effects differed between p <dig> and erk1/ <dig> map kinases. these results provide new insights into the complex effects of estrogens on bladder nociceptor signalling.

methods
a total of  <dig> female sprague-dawley rats  were used for this study. for in vitro studies, animals were 6- <dig> weeks old at the time of tissue removal. the in vivo studies were designed such that the manipulations were commenced at a similar age  and tissues removed at 9- <dig> weeks of age . rats were obtained from animal resources centre  and all procedures were approved by the university of sydney and royal north shore hospital ethics committees, and conducted in accordance with the australian code of practice for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes  and the national institutes of health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. all efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering. the estrous cycle of the animals was monitored but not controlled for in these experiments. we did not observe any effects of estrus cycle stage for any of the parameters measured so the results were pooled. much larger numbers of animals would be required to exclude or confirm an effect of estrus cycle on our measurements.

in vitro studies
rats were heavily anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone  then decapitated. dorsal root ganglia  were cultured and prepared for western blotting analyses as described previously  <cit> . briefly, drg were dissected from spinal levels l <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig> and s <dig>  the capsule was quickly removed from each ganglion under a dissecting microscope, ganglia pooled and transferred into modified tyrodes solution containing  nacl  <dig>  nahco <dig>  <dig>  kcl  <dig>  cacl <dig>  <dig>  mgcl <dig>  <dig>  hepes  <dig>  glucose  <dig> with antibiotic-antimycotic solution. drgs were then treated with collagenase  and trypsin  at 37°c for  <dig> h, washed, triturated, overlayed on bovine serum albumin  and centrifuged at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min to remove myelin and debris. the pellet was resuspended with neurobasal a and b <dig>  and for western blotting studies, neurons plated onto disposable plastic petri dishes, previously coated with polyornithine  and laminin . for immunohistochemistry, neurons were plated onto glass coverslips similarly coated with polyornithine and laminin. the neurons were maintained at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% co <dig> for 18- <dig> h before use, to minimize any acute effects of dissociation  on cell signaling  <cit> . cultures were then treated with appropriate reagents added to the culture medium as indicated for each experiment in the results. at the end of treatment, the culture was washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline , then  <dig> μl ice-cold t-per protein extraction reagent  containing a standard protease inhibitor cocktail  and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail  was added. cultured cells were removed with a cell scraper, briefly sonicated and centrifuged at  <dig>  g for  <dig> min; the supernatant was collected and stored at -20°c for western blotting. all culture experiments contained an internal control , each sample was tested in duplicate and each experiment was replicated three times.

immunohistochemistry
cultures were fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde for  <dig> min, blocked and permeabilised in phosphate buffered saline  containing 10% horse serum and  <dig> % triton x- <dig> for  <dig> h, then incubated with primary antibodies for  <dig> h. antisera against the following antigens were used: β-tubulin isotype type iii , erα , erβ . cultures were then incubated with cy3- or fitc-tagged secondary antibodies  for  <dig> h. dapi  was used as a nuclear counterstain. coverslips were mounted onto slides in  <dig>  m bicarbonate-buffered glycerol  and viewed with an olympus bx- <dig> fluorescence microscope. images  were captured using an rt spot camera  and digitised using image pro plus software . for figure production, minor adjustments were made to contrast and brightness of the entire image, to best represent the immunostaining as viewed under the microscope, using adobe photoshop .

in vivo studies
four groups of rats were studied: control , ovariectomy , cyclophosphamide-treated  and ovariectomy prior to cyclophosphamide treatment . for the ovariectomy group, rats were anaesthetised with ketamine  and xylazine  prior to performing a bilateral ovariectomy. four weeks later rats were deeply anaesthetised with sodium pentobarbitone  and drg  removed and pooled for protein extraction as described above. tissues from age-matched intact controls were also removed at this time. a second experimental group of rats was treated with cyclophosphamide  to induce inflammation of the lower urinary tract  <cit> . to administer cyp, animals were briefly anaesthetised with isoflurane then injected with cyp in sterile  <dig> % sodium chloride , every three days  <cit> . on day  <dig>  animals were heavily anaesthetised with sodium pentobarbitone as above, and drg removed and pooled for protein extraction as above. for the ovx-cyp group, rats were ovariectomised and four weeks later cyp treatment was administered as above, then drg removed for protein studies. drgs were placed in  <dig> μl ice-cold t-per protein extraction reagent  containing a standard protease inhibitor cocktail  and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail , and homogenized on ice for at least  <dig> min. homogenized samples were centrifuged at  <dig>  g for  <dig> min to pellet tissue debris. supernatant was collected and stored at -20°c in aliquots for western blotting.

western blotting
protein extracted from freshly dissected or cultured drgs was mixed with protein loading buffer and heated at 99°c for  <dig> min, and then kept on ice, until loaded and separated on 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel . proteins were then transferred onto pvdf membrane for  <dig> h on ice and the membrane with transferred proteins then blocked with 5% non-fat milk solution in tbs/tween  for  <dig> hr at room temperature. the membrane was then washed and incubated overnight at 4°c with an antibody raised in rabbit against phospho-p <dig>  or phospho-erk1/ <dig> . after washing, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit igg  for  <dig> h at room temperature. a single band  for phospho-p <dig> or double bands  for phospho-erk1/ <dig> were visualized using ecl plus . the membranes were stripped with stripping buffer  for  <dig> min and rinsed with tbst for  <dig> min. the membrane was re-blotted with primary antibody against total p <dig>  or total erk1/ <dig>  overnight at 4°c, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit igg as above. a single band  for p <dig> or double bands  for erk1/ <dig> were visualized with ecl plus. band densities were converted to numerical values using quantity one , subtracting background values from an area of gel immediately adjacent to the stained band. exposure times were chosen to avoid pixel saturation.

data are expressed as the ratio of phosphorylated p <dig> or erk against total p <dig> or erk for each sample.

for freshly dissected drg removed from the four in vivo treatment groups, there was sufficient protein available in each sample to allow more than one aliquot to be stored from each animal. this minimised the need for animals in the control group. there were insufficient wells available to run all samples from all groups on one gel, so samples were grouped as follows: run  <dig> comprised all samples from control and ovx groups; run  <dig> comprised all samples from control, cyp and cypovx groups. because long-term treatments  could affect neuronal structure and growth, we also measured β-tubulin in each of these samples; this also allowed for any minor variations in tissue dissection or preparation. gels were divided into two sections to allow separate processing for p-p38/p <dig>  and β-tubulin , based on their different migration speed on gels. one membrane section was processed for p-p <dig> and p <dig> as described above and the other half was probed for β-tubulin  and anti-mouse igg . the results from our in vivo experiments have been expressed as raw values for phosphorylated and total erk  map kinase relative to β-tubulin levels in the same sample. we have also calculated the ratio of phosphorylated to total erk <dig>  erk <dig> or p <dig> map kinase.

RESULTS
17β-estradiol rapidly activated p <dig> mapk by an estrogen receptor-dependent mechanism in cultured drg
treatment of drg cultures with 17β-estradiol  activated p <dig> mapk within  <dig> minutes . that is, there was an increase in phospho-p <dig> compared with total p <dig> protein. this effect was mimicked by the specific estrogen receptor  agonists, ppt  and dpn  . we then tested if the effects of e <dig> would be inhibited by the pure er antagonist, ici <dig>   or the estrogen receptor modulator, tamoxifen , which antagonises estrogen responses in many tissues. this set of experiments showed that while tamoxifen abolished the response to e <dig>  ici <dig>  not only failed to attenuate the e <dig> response but itself activated p <dig> mapk .

we then examined our cultures immunohistochemically to confirm that estrogen receptors  were expressed by adult rat drg neurons in culture and to investigate the possibility of estrogen action on glial cells. neurons were distinguished from glia by their immunoreactivity for β-tubulin and distinctive properties of their nuclei identified by dapi. neuronal nuclei were large with pale dapi staining, and easily distinguished from glial cell nuclei that were smaller, ovoid and more intensely stained  <cit> . after  <dig> h in culture, less than half of the neurons had grown neurites, but many of these possessed long, branching processes . erα-immunoreactivity was identified in many but not all neuronal nuclei . weak erα-immunoreactivity was also present in the cytoplasm of many somata but was rarely evident within neurites. erβ-immunoreactivity was identified in many neuronal nuclei and within the soma cytoplasm, and punctate erβ-immunoreactivity was present in many neurites . neither erα- nor erβ-immunoreactivity were evident in glial cells . we did not quantify the proportion of neurons expressing ers because many neurons showed relatively dim immunoreactivity and we could not confidently determine how many of these should be considered as genuinely er-immunoreactive. together, these two experiments revealed a rapid er-dependent effect of e <dig> on p <dig> activation in drg neurons and suggest that a novel mechanism underpins this action.

chronic estrogen deprivation enhanced p <dig> mapk expression and erk <dig> phosphorylation
although the initial in vitro studies revealed rapid-onset activation of p <dig> mapk signalling by e <dig>  the long-term effects of changing estrogen exposure in vivo are of considerable physiological interest. we therefore compared the effects of prolonged estrogen deprivation  on the expression and activation of p <dig> mapk within extracts of lumbosacral drg, focusing on those spinal levels that innervate the urinary bladder . relative to β-tubulin, both total and phosphorylated p <dig> were increased by ovariectomy, but the ratio of phosphorylated p <dig> to total p <dig> protein remained unchanged. in contrast, ovariectomy did enhance erk <dig> phosphorylation but had no effect on total erk <dig> protein levels . ovariectomy had no significant effect on erk <dig> protein levels or erk <dig> phosphorylation .

compared with ovariectomy, lower urinary tract inflammation had similar effects on p <dig> but not erk
chronic lower urinary tract inflammation, i.e. cyp treatment for  <dig> days, caused a similar effect on p <dig> map kinase as ovariectomy. that is, inflammation alone caused a small increase in p <dig> protein expression , however after inflammation there was no parallel increase in p <dig> phosphorylation . moreover, the inflammation-induced increase in p <dig> protein was not influenced by prior ovariectomy . inflammation caused an increase in both phospho-erk <dig> and phospho-erk <dig> but when corrected for loading controls  there was no net effect on phosphorylation of either enzyme . these measurements were not significantly affected by prior ovariectomy .

discussion
we have made a number of novel findings that reveal the complexity of estrogenic actions and inflammation in lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia  and suggest potential strategies for modulating the activity of these neurons in order to attenuate afferent hyperactivity or pain states. in summary, in lumbosacral drg acute treatment with er agonists initiated rapid phosphorylation of p <dig> map kinase, whereas prolonged estrogen deprivation in vivo  did not have a long-lasting effect on p <dig> map kinase phosphorylation; instead it caused an increase in p <dig> expression. it has previously been reported that estradiol causes rapid activation of erk1/ <dig> in adult rat drgs  <cit> . in the present study, prolonged estrogen deprivation in vivo had no effect on expression of erk1/ <dig> in drgs but caused their prolonged phosphorylation. there were some similarities in the effects of inflammation but the responses were generally smaller or failed to reach statistical significance. it is important to recognise that whereas ovariectomy may influence a broader range of neurons, cyp treatment is likely to target only a small proportion of neurons present in the drg extracts , so the actions on map kinase signalling less readily identified. the effects of cyp treatment may be larger if bladder-specific neurons could be studied separately, or if upper lumbar and sacral neurons were distinguished.

there are a growing number of examples of rapid actions of estrogen in the nervous system; the mechanisms are diverse and vary considerably between different types of tissues  <cit> . while not yet examined extensively, rapid effects of estrogens have also been reported in drg, including an action on intracellular calcium levels and atp-induced calcium currents  <cit> , as well as er-dependent erk and creb phosphorylation  <cit> . in the present study, the effect of estradiol to rapidly stimulate p <dig> phosphorylation in drg neurons in short-term culture was mimicked by agonists of erα and erβ, which in vivo are co-expressed by many lumbosacral drg neurons  <cit> . involvement of er in this response is also indicated by the blockade by tamoxifen. the transient nature of a rapid response to a single application of estrogen applied in vitro may not reflect the nature of estrogen actions in vivo, where levels may change more slowly due to changes in circulating hormones  or local production from aromatase-expressing target tissues. nevertheless these observations are, to our knowledge, the first to indicate the ability of estrogens to active p <dig> map kinase in sensory ganglia.

there are numerous reports of rapid, er-dependent activation of p <dig> signalling in non-neuronal cells . however, in the current study we may have identified a novel mechanism of er-dependent p <dig> activation, suggested by the observation that the er-antagonist, ici <dig>  not only mimicked but also enhanced the estrogen response. an "estrogen agonist" effect of ici <dig> has been observed previously in rat drg, where estradiol inhibition of trpv <dig> activity was inhibited by tamoxifen but mimicked by ici <dig>  <cit> . however, in this earlier study, estrogen agonists and ici <dig>  were each administered to neurons for a much longer period , which allowed the consideration of a larger variety of possible contributing mechanisms. the "agonist" effect of overnight treatment with ici <dig>  could be due to "tethering" of er with transcription factors,  that affects the nature of subsequent actions with various agents, including ici <dig>   <cit> . however, in the current study, our rapid treatment with these agents makes this mechanism less likely so many additional molecular studies will need to be performed to determine the basis of ici <dig>  actions. it is also possible that the effects of ici <dig>  observed here are independent of er, although this agent is widely considered to be highly specific for these receptors.

our studies examining the impact of chronic estrogen deprivation and inflammation revealed further complexity in the modulation of map kinase signalling pathways in lumbosacral sensory ganglia. estrogen deprivation for  <dig> weeks following ovariectomy caused quite different effects on p <dig>  erk <dig> and erk <dig> signalling pathways from the rapid treatment with estrogen. these showed an upregulation of p <dig> expression , increased erk <dig> phosphorylation  and no change in erk <dig> expression or phosphorylation. a change in expression of any of the map kinases has not commonly been reported after neuronal perturbation and the physiological implications of this are unknown.

the dissimilar actions we observed on each type of map kinase are of particular interest in light of a recent study on the effects of bee venom-induced inflammation and hyperalgesia on spinal cord neurons, which showed distinct kinetics of activation for each map kinase, i.e. erk activation occurs rapidly  after challenge but p <dig> activation occurs more slowly   <cit> . this study also showed a spatial difference in the erk and p <dig> activation patterns within the cord. in our study, the greater effects of our manipulations on erk <dig> than erk <dig> were unexpected, as numerous studies report parallel changes in these two signalling pathways following cell stimulation. however, recent studies have not only identified functional differences in erk <dig> and erk <dig>  <cit>  and distinct consequences of erk <dig> and erk <dig> loss  <cit> , but also described the structural bases for their functional differences  <cit> . it is possible that different populations of pelvic nociceptors also show distinct responses.

previous studies of somatic inflammation have demonstrated an effect on phosphorylation of both erk and p <dig> map kinases . our results show that prolonged  visceral inflammation caused only a very modest effect on phospho-erk levels in lumbosacral drg, an effect that did not achieve statistical significance when loading controls  were considered. an earlier study using a similar model of bladder inflammation in rats did not detect a comparable change in erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation in lumbosacral drg, although they did report a transient  increase in erk <dig> activation  <cit> .

in the current study we could not directly assess the impact of estrogen status on the subsequent response to inflammation because ovariectomy alone caused effects on p <dig> and erk map kinases. the possibility that these two perturbations activate convergent modulatory mechanisms should be explored further, particularly given the recent observation that some symptoms resembling aspects of interstitial cystitis develop in erβ-knockout mice  <cit> . it is also possible that local estrogen production  impacts on modulation of neuronal signalling by inflammation. conversely, inflammation of the lower urinary tract may impact on circulating estrogen levels or local estrogen production. moreover, estrogens have a complex role in modulating inflammation  <cit> , so the nature of cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis may not be the same in ovariectomised animals.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has revealed novel patterns of activation of p <dig> and erk map kinases in lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia following acute exposure in vitro or chronic deprivation of estrogens in vivo. the diversity of estrogen actions in these ganglia that have a major role in pelvic visceral pain raises the possibility of developing new ways to modulate their function in hyperactivity or pain states.
