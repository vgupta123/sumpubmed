BACKGROUND
in moths, reproductive isolation relies heavily on mature female adults producing and releasing species-specific sex pheromone components to attract conspecific males. adult male antennae on the other hand specifically perceive these sex pheromone components from a distance resulting in the successful location of the female to initiate and complete mating behavior  <cit> . in lepidopterans, type i sex pheromone components are fatty acid derivatives with 0– <dig> double bond containing carbon chains of varying lengths  and an oxygenated functional group that can be an aldehyde, alcohol or an acetate ester. type ii sex pheromone components are hydrocarbons or epoxides  <cit> . in female moths, the type i sex pheromones are synthesized de novo and the genes involved in the biosynthesis are regulated in a specialized manner in their sex pheromone glands . sex pheromone biosynthesis employs a modified fatty-acid biosynthesis pathway that includes various processes such as acetylation, desaturation, chain shortening, reduction, and oxidation, either separately or in combination  <cit> .

type i sex pheromone biosynthesis pathway in moths initiates in pg by the release of pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide  from the subesophageal ganglion, which then circulates unbound to the pg where it binds to the pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide receptor   <cit> . the resulting signal, then triggers several enzyme pathways starting with acetyl-coa carboxylase  that catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-coa to malonyl-coa and finally resulting in the synthesis of pheromone precursors   <cit> . later, double bonds are introduced into the pheromone precursors at specific positions  by different desaturases , and the chain is shortened by a modified β-oxidation pathway  <cit> . finally, the unsaturated pheromone precursors are modified to form various functional groups such as aldehyde, alcohol or acetate ester, by three enzymes, aldehyde reductase, fatty acyl reductase and acetyltransferase, respectively . some of these enzymes have been shown to have substrate specificity. for example, pgfars from spodoptera exigua have substrate preference for c <dig> and c <dig> fatty acids  <cit> .

males on the other hand, have evolved a sensitive antennal olfaction system to trace even very low amounts of sex pheromone components released from the female located at a long distance  <cit> . these sex pheromone components enter the male antennal pores and are transported by pheromone binding proteins   through the antennal sensillum, and activate membrane-bound pheromone receptors  . after pr activation, the pheromone molecules must be rapidly degraded to release and refresh the pr. depending on the functional group on a pheromone, whether an aldehyde, alcohol or ester, degradation of pheromones involves specific enzymes in the pheromone degradation pathway. aldehyde oxidase  is an antennal enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of aldehyde sex pheromones to carboxylic acids, which were biochemically characterized in the antennae of manduca sexta  <cit> , antheraea polyphemus and bombyx mori  <cit> . thus far, only one insect aox  from amyelois transitella has been functionally characterized to hydrolyze aldehyde sex pheromone components and some plant volatiles in vitro  <cit> . however, a number of putative aox genes have been reported in lepidopterans at the nucleic acid level . aldehyde-degradation involves the nad− dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase  and ar enzymes that convert sex pheromones to their corresponding acids and alcohols, respectively . antennal carboxyl/cholinesterase  hydrolyzes ester sex pheromone components. in previous studies, we functionally characterized five carboxyl/cholinesterases  belonging to the cce family from s. exigua and spodoptera litura; in vitro expressed sexicxe <dig> specifically degraded ester plant volatiles and three other cces  had dual roles, i.e., they hydrolyzed sex pheromone components as well as plant volatiles . other members of the multi-function enzyme families include cyps  <cit> , ugts  <cit>  and gsts  <cit> , which are also considered as odorant-degrading enzymes  or pheromone-degrading enzymes .

the diamondback moth , plutella xylostella , is a notorious pest of cruciferous vegetables worldwide. the major known pheromone components extracted from female dbm moth pgs include three different functional groups that were type i sex pheromone components; -11-hexadecenal   <cit> , -11-hexadecenyl acetate   and -11-hexadecenol  . these studies also revealed that both female and male dbm need precise regulation of sex pheromone biosynthesis that facilitates their communication through the various structural components. in recent years, sex pheromone reception has been studied extensively because of its potential use as green targets for environmentally friendly pest control measures. male dbms have pbps that are designed for sex pheromone reception. thus far, three pbps have been cloned and characterized in p. xylostella. these pbps robustly bound all three sex pheromone components   <cit>  thereby enhancing the electrophysiological responses of dbm to sex pheromone components in vitro  <cit> . in the recently sequenced dbm genome  <cit> , two gene sequences likely to be odorant/pheromone-degrading enzymes such as cyps  <cit>  and gsts  <cit>  were identified. however, the tissue specific expression of these genes are not known. to identify additional genes involved in the dbm pheromone biosynthesis and degradation, in this study, we combined transcriptome based digital gene expression  and genome mapping. by using these methods, we identified a total of  <dig> genes belonging to  <dig> gene families potentially involved in the sex pheromone biosynthesis and degradation pathways. the tissue specific expression pattern of these genes was also confirmed qpcr.

RESULTS
overview of the transcriptomes
six transcriptomes from male antennae , female antennae , legs , heads , abdomens  and female pheromone glands  were sequenced using the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform  and assembled with trinity . to obtain an accurate expression pattern, we removed as much of the ovipositor as possible from the females due to its adherence to the pheromone glands . illumina sequencing yielded  <dig> – <dig>  giga bases  for each of the six transcriptomes. we first mapped the transcriptome reads to the dbm reference genome   and obtained the following mapping rates that were favourable for annotation:  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> %  and  <dig> % . then, we supplemented the original genome annotation file  and found  <dig>  novel genes . further to obtain more unigenes, we also performed a de novo assembly of the six transcriptomes that yielded unigenes with a median length of 334 nt with the longest unigene being  <dig>  nt in length. finally, these reads were assembled into  <dig>  transcripts and  <dig>  unigenes, with n <dig> lengths of  <dig>  and  <dig>  nt, respectively .fig.  <dig> dissection of p. xylostella female sex pheromone glands. the pheromone glands from female p. xylostella were squeezed out from the abdomen using forceps . the abdomen of p. xylostella was cut at the sclerotized cuticle from the 8th abdominal segment, and the sclerotized cuticle was removed before immersing the glands in liquid nitrogen. 1: sclerotized ovipositor valves; 2: pheromone gland; 3: sclerotized cuticle that was removed






blastx searches of all  <dig>  unigenes showed that  <dig> % were homologous to proteins in several insect genome databases  with a cut-off e-value of 10− <dig>  the highest homology  was with b. mori sequences, followed by sequences from d. plexippus , a. gambiae , d. melanogaster , and t. castaneum  .

then, we used blast2go to annotate unigenes into functional groups based on gene ontology . the go annotations were used to classify the transcripts into functional groups according to specific go categories. in the molecular function category, the genes expressed were mostly enriched for catalytic activity  and binding . in the biological process category, the most common were the cellular and metabolic processes. in the cellular component category, the most represented were the following two terms: cell  and cell part  .

the putative pathways of pheromone biosynthesis and degradation are shown in fig.  <dig>  we identified a number of genes related to the pathways by using the blastx search. below, we describe the specific tissue expression patterns of these genes using qpcr.fig.  <dig> proposed biosynthetic pathway of sex pheromone production in female dbm moths 




genes involved in the sex pheromone biosynthesis pathway
pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide receptor 
insect pheromone biosynthesis is regulated by pbanr that binds to pban released from the suboesophagal ganglion in the brain  <cit> . to date, no more than four alternative splice transcripts such as isoforms as, a, b and c with differences in their c-terminal sequences have been reported in one insect species  <cit> . b and c typically consist of the yxxΦ endosomal sorting motif and the complete seven transmembrane regions  <cit> . although all four pbanrs are expressed dominantly in pgs, only pbanr-b and pbanr-c have been identified as intracellularly localized with some cell surface localization. pbanr-as and pbanr-a on the other hand, were completely intracellular, suggesting that pbanr-b and pbanr-c could be principal receptors participating in the pban signal reception  <cit> . in this study, we found two additional alternative splice transcripts  that possessed c-termini different from dbm pbanr genes previously described in the genome  <cit>  . we named them as pluxypbanr-c, −b and -a. multiple amino acid sequence alignment of these pbanr isoforms showed the presence of typical pbanr sequence features . we further analyzed the tissue expression pattern of pluxypbanr-c and -b by comparing their fpkm values  in the transcriptomes from the different tissues. the results showed at least 3- and 5-fold higher numbers for pluxypbanr-c and -b transcripts, respectively in pg than in other tissues studied, and is consistent with reports from other moths such as agrotis ipsilon  <cit> , b. mori  <cit>  and heliothis virescens  <cit> .fig.  <dig> heat map illustration of the tissue expression profile of sex pheromone biosynthesis and degradation genes based on fpkm values. m_ant, male antennae; f_ant, female antennae; h, head; l, leg; ab, abdomen; pg, female pheromone gland. gene names are indicated on the left. scale bar on bottom right indicates the degree of expression




acetyl coa carboxylase  
the first step in moth pheromone biosynthesis is the atp-dependent carboxylation of acetyl-coa to malonyl-coa by acc  <cit> . this is a rate-limiting step in fatty acid biosynthesis  <cit> . in our transcriptome data set, seven acc transcripts were identified  with all showing robust expression in the abdomen followed by pg . among these, pxacc <dig>  pxacc <dig> and pxacc <dig> showed higher expression than the others in pgs. in addition, homology analysis revealed that pxacc <dig> shared 73% amino acid identity with the acc homolog from papilio xuthus , 70% with helicoverpa assulta  and 66% with d. plexippus . pxacc <dig> is a full-length acc, and the predicted protein from this transcript shared a high amino acid identity  with the acc from agrotis segetum   <cit> . similar to a. segetum acc, pxacc <dig> also had dominant expression in the abdomen as well as in pg but without significant difference. pxacc <dig> also shared a high amino acid sequence identity  with acc from b. mori  indicating a similar function for acc homologs.

fatty acid synthase  
in moths, saturated fatty acid is produced from malonyl-coa and nadph in a reaction catalyzed by fas  <cit> . in this study, we found seven putative transcripts with high amino acid identities to known fas genes  . only one partial fas transcript was found in the genome annotation, two novel transcripts were identified via genome mapping and four new fas transcripts were found among the unigenes after de novo assembly. none of the seven pxfas genes showed dominant expression in pgs . five of the pxfass displayed abdomen biased expression, unlike the two homologs, fas from a. ipsilon  and a. segetum  that shared  <dig> and 72% amino acid identity with pxfas <dig> and pxfas <dig>  respectively and were expressed higher in pgs than in the abdomen  <cit> .

fatty acid transport protein  
the fatty acid transport protein  has been functionally characterized by in vitro expression and knock down assay in b. mori  <cit>  and eilema japonica  <cit> . these studies showed that fatp catalyzes the atp-dependent esterification of extracellular long-chain fatty acids in sex pgs to produce the corresponding acyl-coa derivatives. four pxfatps unigenes were found in this study; pxfatp <dig> shared high amino acid identity  with fatp from e. japonica ; pxfatp <dig> and  <dig> shared  <dig> and 81% amino acid identity, respectively with fatp <dig> and fatp <dig> from sesamia inferens  <cit> . all three pxfatps displayed ubiquitous expression  indicating the lack of specialized function in the sex pheromone biosynthesis pathway. pxfatp <dig> was not detected in any tissue in our transcriptome data, and thus maybe a pseudogene .

desaturase  
typically moth pheromones contain double bonds, which require desaturases to introduce the bonds into specific locations in the fatty acyl carbon chains  <cit> . depending on the locations of the double bonds introduced, des can be classified into the following major groups: Δ <dig>  <cit> , Δ <dig>  <cit> , Δ <dig> , Δ <dig>  <cit> , Δ <dig>  <cit>  and Δ <dig>  <cit> . the major sex pheromone components in dbm are z11-16:ald, z11-16:oac and z11-16:oh  <cit> . a single z11-16:ald can trigger copulation behaviour in male moths  <cit> . thus, Δ <dig> desaturase is expected to play a key role in this pheromone component biosynthesis. investigation of the presence of desaturases in our transcriptome data set using genome mapping and de novo transcriptome assembly revealed  <dig> pxyldes transcripts . fpkm and qpcr analysis revealed that pxyldes <dig> and  <dig> were expressed abundantly in pg .﻿ in addition, phylogenetic analysis showed that pxyldes <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> clustered into the Δ <dig> clade, which also had the sinfdes <dig> homolog from s. inferens  <cit>  . thus, we propose that the two pxdes may be involved in the desaturation of z11-16:coa, the major sex pheromone component in dbm. ten additional pxyldes were assigned to other desaturase groups and also did not have pg biased expression. these genes may also be involved in other physiological functions rather than sex pheromone component desaturation.fig.  <dig> relative expression levels of sex pheromone biosynthesis and degradation gene transcripts with antennae or pheromone gland-biased expression in different adult tissues. m_ant, male antennae; f_ant, female antennae; h, head; l, leg; ab, abdomen; pg, female pheromone gland

fatty acyl reductase  
in dbm, z11-16: oh is a main sex pheromone component  <cit> , which is produced by the reduction of fatty acyl precursor, z11-16:coa, in an nadph dependent reaction . in this study, we identified in total, seven putative far transcripts, named pxfar1- <dig> . among them, pxfar <dig> and pxfar <dig>  clustered with the pgfar clade . all fars in this group displayed pg dominant expression, including the first identified pgfar from b. mori  <cit> , slitfar <dig> from s. litura  <cit>  and sinffar <dig> from s. inferens  <cit> . together, the fpkm value and qpcr analysis showed that among the seven pxfars, pxfar <dig> had the highest expression  in pgs when compared to the other tested tissues . therefore, pxfar <dig> may likely play a major role in the conversion of z11-16:coa to z11-16:oh in dbm. in addition, we found another far predominantly expressed in pg; pxfar <dig> that did not cluster with the pgfar group. it shared high amino acid identity  with yevofari from yponomeuta evonymellus . a previous report on the pg specific expression of yevofari determined by qpcr analysis was also not clear  <cit> . the expression and functional analyses of this clade need further investigation.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of typical insect far genes. pxfars are highlighted in red. species abbreviations: bmor. b. mori; cqui. c.ulex quinquefasciatus; yevo. y. evonymellus; ypad. y. padellus; yror. y. rorrellus; hass. h. assulta; harm. h. armigera; hsub. h. subflexa; hvir. h. virescens; nvit. n. vitripennis; amel. a. mellifera; sinv. s. invicta; hsal. h. saltator; cflo. c. floridanus; osca. o. scapulalis; aaeg. aedes aegypti; dmoj. d. mojavensis; dvir. d. virilis; dgri. d. grimshawi; dwii. d. willistoni; dper. d. persimilis; dpse. d. pseudoobscura; dana. d. ananassae; dsec. d. sechellia; dere. d. erecta; dyak. d. yakuba; dpul. d. pulex; dmel. d. melanogaster and apis. a. pisum





acetyltransferase 
act is known to convert fatty acid alcohol to the corresponding ester in plants . however, no act related to sex pheromone component biosynthesis has been thus far identified at the molecular level. in this study, we identified  <dig> act transcripts, pxylact1- <dig>  by homolog searches using sequences  obtained from our previous studies as query; slitacts from s. litura  <cit> , sinfacts from s. inferens  <cit>  and asegacts from a. segetum  <cit>  . we found that only pxact <dig> displayed pg abundant expression via fpkm and qpcr analysis . further, blastx showed that pxact <dig> shared a low amino acid identity  with asegact   <cit> , which was shown to lack esterification activity by using in vitro yeast expression system and gc-ms analysis  <cit> . not surprisingly, asegact was not abundant in pg, and its fpkm value in pg was almost equal to that in the abdomen  <cit> . three acts from agrotis ipsilon, atf-kc <dig>  atf-kc <dig> and atf-kc <dig>  were mainly expressed in pg than the rest of the body  <cit> . their homologs in dbm are pxact <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which shared  <dig>   <dig> and 91% amino acid identities, respectively. however, none of these displayed pg dominant expression .

alcohol dehydrogenase 
alcohol dehydrogenase converts alcohol compounds to corresponding aldehydes. however, no alcohol dehydrogenase has been identified at the molecular level from insect pgs although biochemical studies have shown the presence of alcohol dehydrogenses in the pgs of several species such as heliothis virescens  <cit> , helicoverpa armigera  <cit>  and h. assulta  <cit> . z11-16:ald was found to be a major sex pheromone in dbm, indicating that ad plays a crucial role in its biosynthesis. in this study, we conducted a blastp analysis by using previously identified sinfads from s. inferens  <cit> , aipsads from a. ipsilon  <cit> , cpomads from cydia pomonella  <cit> , hassads from h. assulta  <cit> , harmads from h. armigera  <cit>  and hvirad from h. virescens  <cit> . we found in total,  <dig> ads in dbm, named pxylad1- <dig> . the fpkm values of these  <dig> pxylads revealed that only one ad  had pg dominant expression. qpcr assay also confirmed this  and showed at least 2-fold higher expression in pg than in other tested tissues . we also found several homologs of previously identified ads from h. armigera  and h. assulta  that had pg biased expression  <cit> . in our study, pxylad <dig> shared the highest amino acid identity  <dig> % with hassad <dig>  but pxylad <dig> had not pg predominant expression. but, pg-enriched pxylad <dig> shared only  <dig> % amino acid identity with hassad <dig> 

sex pheromone and other odorant-degrading enzyme genes
aldehyde oxidase 
aldehyde oxidase is considered as a sensillum enzyme that degrades redundant aldehyde odorants  to corresponding acids without the need for coenzymes . we found three full-length aoxs in the dbm transcriptomes via genome mapping. these were named pxylaox <dig>  pxylaox <dig> and pxylaox <dig> , all containing the typical conserved motifs: a fad-binding domain, two putative iron-sulfur  redox centers, and a molybdenum-cofactor -binding site. one 2fe-2s redox center contains four conserved cysteine residues that coordinate with iron. pxylaox <dig> and pxylaox <dig> likely originated from a gene duplication event because they were located in the same scaffold . based on fpkm values and qpcr analysis, pxylaox <dig> and pxylaox <dig> were identified to have antennae enriched expression without sex-bias; pxylaox <dig> expression in the antennae was more than 60-fold higher and pxylaox <dig> expression was 40-fold higher than in other tissues. in addition, pxylaox <dig> expression was higher than pxylaox <dig> , while pxylaox <dig> showed ubiquitous expression and therefore may perform a more generalized function. we also noticed a putative aox identified in the dbm genome   <cit> . this sequence was identified as a xanthine dehydrogenase  member by blastx search. a phylogenetic tree constructed by using known insect aoxs and xdh as an out group  showed the distribution of insect aoxs into three major groups; group  <dig> consisted of dipteran aox, group  <dig> had pxylaox <dig> and pxylaox <dig>  and group  <dig> had atraaox <dig> from a. transitella and their homologs, which were shown to degrade the aldehyde sex pheromone component, z11z13–16ald and several aldehyde plant volatiles  <cit> , and sinfaox <dig> from s. inferens with antennae dominant expression  <cit> . pxylaox <dig> clustered with group  <dig> along with bmoraox <dig>  <cit> , bmoraox <dig>  <cit> , sinfaox <dig>  <cit> , sinfaox <dig>  <cit> , and mbraaox  <cit> , all of which have antennae enriched expression pattern. however, like other aoxs, pxylaox <dig> and  <dig> did not show sex biased expression suggesting that they may be specifically involved in aldehyde plant volatiles degradation rather than sex pheromone component pathways.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of typical insect aox genes. pxylaoxs are highlighted in red. species abbreviations: dmel, d. melanogaster; bmor, b. mori; cqui, c quinquefasciatus; agam, a. gambiae; aaeg, a. aegypti; ofur, ostrinia. furnacalis; sinf, s. inferens; atra, a. transitella and mbra. mamestra. brassicae. scale bar on top left indicates the color code for bootstrap values in the phylogenetic tree




aldehyde dehydrogenase  and aldehyde reductase 
unlike aox, both aldh and ar are thought to be intracellular and nad− dependent enzymes that catalyze the oxidation and reduction of a broad spectrum of aldehyde substrates to their corresponding acids and alcohols, respectively. five pxylaldhs  were identified from the dbm transcriptome data set. among them, only pxylaldh <dig> was mainly expressed in the antennae as determined by the fpkm value and qpcr analysis . the expression level of pxylaldh <dig> in pg was at least 2-fold higher than in other tested tissues, indicating its likely function in odorant-degradation. similar to aox, this gene also showed no sex-biased expression suggesting that it is involved in plant volatiles degradation. a previous study showed that one aldh, aaaldh <dig>  oxidizes farnesal into farnesoic acid in aedes aegypti  <cit> . but this gene only shared 11% amino acid identity with pxylaldh <dig>  suggesting that they could act on different substrates. the ars in general, include four reductase superfamilies; medium-chain dehydrogenases/reductases , short chain dehydrogenases/reductases , aldo-keto reductases  and nadb  reductases. through motif and blast analyses, we found in total,  <dig> ars among which were six mdrs , eight akrs  and one nadb . however, no sdr was found . in b. mori  <cit>  and h. armigera  <cit> , two akrs have been characterized in vitro; these were reductases that converted the sex pheromone components, e <dig> z12-16:ald , z9-16:ald  and z11-16:ald  to corresponding alcohols. fpkm values did not show ar expression specific to the antennae. two akrs shared the most amino acid identities with pxylars; these were pxylad <dig>  and pxylad <dig> , but pxylad <dig> and pxylad <dig> displayed ubiquitous expression, indicating their involvement in other physiological functions instead of olfaction alone.

carboxyl/cholinesterase 
insect cce is a superfamily, which participates in many physiological processes and contains various substrates  <cit> . some of them are secretory enzymes that refresh ors by clearing redundant esterase odorants around them. besides z11-16:ald, z11-16:ac is another major sex pheromone component reported in p. xylostella  <cit> . we found  <dig> cces in the dbm transcriptome that was mapped to the reference genome . this total number is lower than  <dig> identified in b. mori  <cit> , but higher than  <dig> found in h. armigera  <cit> . a phylogenetic tree of known insect cces is shown in fig.  <dig>  these cces were named from cce001- <dig> sub-groups based on the b. mori  <cit>  and h. armigera  <cit>   <dig> major clade nomenclature system. by fpkm values and qpcr analysis, five cces were found to have antennae enriched expression ; pxcce005a, 016a, 016c, 016d and 029a. these were distributed into three clades. pxcce016a, 016c and 016d were located in the same sub-clade containing most general intracellular enzymes with dietary detoxification functions or ester odorant degradation functions such as the two cces with antennae dominant expression, slcxe <dig>  <cit>  and sexicxe <dig>  <cit> , that degrade ester plant volatiles. unlike these two cces, pxcce016a, 016c and 016d had no obvious sex biased expression. other cces involved in non-olfactory functions have been described in some previous studies , we found the homologs of these genes among the pxcces, and they did not show antennae dominant expression, thus they may not participate in olfaction. for instance, in group e, the pheromone degrading esterase, apolpde from a. polyphemus  <cit> , pjappde from popillia japonica  <cit> , sexicxe13/slitcxe <dig> from s. exigua and s. litura  <cit> , and dmelest <dig> from d. melanogaster  <cit>  were able to hydrolyze ester sex pheromone components. these genes showed abundant expression in the antennae except sexicxe <dig> and slitcxe <dig>  pxcce026a was their closest homolog, but it showed ubiquitous expression by fpkm analysis. moreover, pxcce016b also showed ubiquitous expression. a recent study showed that pxcce016b was involved in chlorantraniliprole resistance; its increased expression in resistant strains enabled better degradation of ester pesticides  <cit> . the four  <dig> sub-group cces are derived from the same ancestor because they clustered in the same clade in the phylogenetic tree and may have evolved to perform various physiological functions based on the difference in tissue expression patterns between pxcce016b and three other pxcce <dig> cces. pxcce029a and pxcce005a were in the uncharacterized functional clade. the  <dig> clade cces lacked one or more of the enzyme catalytic active site residues, but had another active site called carboxyl/cholinesterase-like adhesion molecules including transmembrane and binding domains  <cit> . thus, pxcce029a may be involved in neuro/developmental functions. we also investigated the intron-exon organization in pxcces . the average intron size was 1290 nt, which was slightly lower than  <dig> in b. mori  <cit> . the longest intron was between exons  <dig> and  <dig> in pxcce027b and comprised  <dig>  nt, similar to that observed in bmcce027b  <cit> . the shortest intron was in pxcce028b between exons  <dig> and  <dig>  and contained only 33 nt. further, the approximate distribution of introns is shown in fig.  <dig>  which shows the positions of introns in pxcces by multiple sequence alignment. we also collected and marked the splice sites into three phases according to their positions in the codons. we noticed the presence of two highly conserved intron insertion sites and the splice site phase was also conserved. the two most conserved introns were a phase  <dig> intron around position  <dig> present in  <dig> cces  and a phase  <dig> intron around position  <dig> in  <dig> cces . the two conserved intron insertion sites and splice site phases were identical to that reported in b. mori cces  <cit> , indicating that these sites were likely conserved since the early stage of cce evolution. in addition, several clade specific conserved sites were also observed and were similar to the clade-specific conservation of intron phase and position reported in p. xylostella gsts  <cit> . all cces in clade  <dig> possessed two conserved introns, phase  <dig> introns at positions  <dig> and  <dig> . notably, two intron insertions and phase splice sites were conserved in two distant clades, 024– <dig> and  <dig> . these conserved introns were also observed in clades  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in b. mori and the neuroligins of d. melanogaster and a. mellifera  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of typical insect cce genes. pxcces are highlighted in red. species abbreviations: dmel. d. melanogaster;

ugt is a superfamily of detoxifying enzymes that improve the excretion of certain molecules by transferring glycosyl residues from nucleotide sugars; for example, hydrophobic molecules are thus converted to hydrophilic molecules for easy excretion. typical examples of such molecules in insects are odorant molecules  <cit> . in the present study,  <dig> ugts were found via genome mapping and transcriptome assembly of all six transcriptomes from dbm . all pxugts presented the classic ugt signature motif  similar to that described for other insect ugts  <cit> . these ugt sequences have been submitted to the ugt nomenclature committee  for nomenclature assignments  <cit>  . to further uncover the putative functions of pxugts, a phylogenetic tree was constructed by using ugts from s. littoralis  <cit> , b. mori  <cit>  and h. armigera  <cit>  . to date, there are  <dig> ugt families identified in lepidopterans  <cit> . pxugts were distributed within  <dig> sub-families; none were in ugt <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sub-families. ugt <dig> and ugt <dig> sub-families had the most members in lepidopteran species  <cit> . similarly, most pxugts were clustered in ugt <dig>  and ugt <dig>  sub-families. in the ugt <dig> sub-family, bmugt33d <dig>  <cit>  and one ugt from m. sexta   <cit>  displayed antennae enriched expression. by using fpkm values and qpcr analysis, we also identified three ugt <dig> family members among pxugts  that displayed antennae dominant expression  indicating their olfactory function. recently, two more ugts from ugt <dig> and  <dig> sub-families, slugt40r <dig> and slugt46a <dig> from s. littoralis, showed abundant expression in the male antennae after exposure of moths to the sex pheromone component, z9e11-14:ac or an ester plant volatile, z3-6:ac. this suggested that the two ugts may be odorant-degrading enzymes. we also found a ugt <dig> member in dbm, pxugt40w <dig>  which displayed the highest expression in antennae than in other tissues. however, there was no significant difference in the expression of pxugt40w <dig> between male and female antennae, thus indicating that it may be involved in the removal of plant volatiles rather than sex pheromone components. in addition, pxugt39b <dig> of the ugt <dig> sub-family also had an antennae enriched expression pattern indicating its olfactory function. however, the functions of its homologs have not been reported yet.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of typical insect ugt genes. pxugts are highlighted in red. species abbreviations: bm. b. mori; sl. s. littoralis; ha. h. armigera





cytochrome p450
cytochrome p <dig> is a multi-functional enzyme in organisms, and is involved in detoxification, resistance, and odorant clearance  <cit> . a previous study annotated  <dig> p <dig> genes  in dbm but the tissue specific expression pattern was investigated only in the larval stages but not in adult tissues  <cit> . in the present study, the  <dig> pxcyps were analyzed in various adult tissue transcriptomes and validated via qpcr . we found that eight pxcyps had predominant expression in the antennae of both sexes, and belonged to three cyp sub-families, cyp3: pxcyp321e <dig>  366c1; cyp4: pxcyp 4g <dig>  4 m <dig>  and cyp6: pxcyp6an <dig>  6bg <dig>  6bg <dig> and 6cn <dig> . one cyp <dig> member, cyp345e <dig>  which is an antenna-specific cyp from the pine beetle, d. ponderosae, was shown to catalyze the oxidation of monoterpene volatiles from pine hosts  <cit> . in our study, we found  <dig> cyp345e <dig> homologs in dbm; pxcyp321e <dig> and pxcyp366c <dig>  both with higher expression in the antennae. in addition, pxcyp366c <dig> had the highest expression in the antennae when compared to other candidate odorant-degrading cyps. this gene was also reported as highly expressed in adult heads from different developmental stages  <cit> , indicating that pxcyp366c <dig> plays a vital role in specific olfactory behaviors of dbm adults; an example of such behavior could be locating oviposition sites. some members of the cyp <dig> sub-family were also identified to be olfactory related. cyp4aw <dig> in p. diversa was reported to be involved in pheromone inactivation by analyzing its antennae specificity and through electrophysiological studies  <cit> . in dbm, we identified  <dig> cyp <dig> genes; pxcyp4g <dig> and 4 m <dig> both with robust expression in the antennae. a previous study reported the high expression of pxcyp4m <dig> in an insecticide-resistance strain than in the susceptible strain  <cit> . together with its tissue specific expression pattern, we propose that pxcyp4m <dig> may participate in insecticide detoxification in the antennae of the insecticide-resistance strain. in the cyp <dig> sub-family, no member has been reported to have odorant clearance function. however, several genes have been reported to have olfactory organ specific expression; for example cyp6w <dig>  <cit>  and cyp6a <dig>  <cit>  in d. melanogaster, and cyp6b <dig>  cyp6b <dig> and cyp6ae <dig> expressed in the antennae of both sexes and male proboscis in s. littoralis  <cit> . we found four cyp <dig> members in dbm  that were abundant in the antennae. pxcyp6bg <dig> and 6bg <dig> had high expression in the larvae than in adults  <cit> , suggesting that the two cyp genes may be involved in odorant clearance in larvae.

glutathione s-transferase 
the functions of gsts in many insect physiological functions such as insecticide resistance  <cit>  and detoxification  <cit>  have been well-documented. in this study, we identified in total,  <dig> pxgsts from the transcriptomes of dbm. in comparison with a previous study  <cit>  we identified three new gsts, pxgste <dig>  pxgste <dig> and pxgstu <dig> in dbm . since pxgstu <dig> was not detected in the transcriptomes of all tested tissues we presume that this may be a pseudogene. one olfactory-specific gst from m. sexta named, gstmsolf <dig>  was reported to degrade the plant volatile, trans-2-hexenal  <cit> . when we used the deduced amino acid sequence of this protein as query in a blastp search, we found that it belonged to the gst sub-family delta. however, all three antennae enriched pxgsts we identified in this study belonged to the gst sub-family epsilon . we identified three new gsts; pxgste <dig>  pxgste <dig> and pxgste <dig>  among these, pxgste <dig> had the highest expression and was consistent with a previous report that showed robust expression of pxgste <dig> in adults  <cit> . this suggested that pxgste <dig> could participate in odorant degradation in the adult stage.

CONCLUSIONS
based on massive illumina sequencing, in this study we sequenced the transcriptomes from six tissues of the diamondback moth. genome mapping and de novo assembly of our dbm transcriptome data provides a reference gene set for sex pheromone biosynthesis pathway and degradation genes in this notorious agricultural pest. further analysis of their tissue specific expression pattern via digital gene expression and qpcr validation revealed the identification of the following genes in the pheromone biosynthesis and degradation pathways. a) in the sex pheromone biosynthesis gene category, we identified two pban receptor isoforms with pg biased expression,  <dig> accs,  <dig> fass,  <dig> fatps,  <dig> dess,  <dig> fars,  <dig> acts and  <dig> ads. two pg abundant pxdess, pxdes <dig> and  <dig>  could be involved in Δ <dig> desaturation. three possible candidate pgfars, pxfar <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were also identified to have pg dominant expression and could participate in the reduction of z11-16:acid to z11-16:oh. b) in the odorant/sex pheromone-degrading gene category, we identified three aoxs, five aldhs,  <dig> ars,  <dig> cces,  <dig> ugts,  <dig> p450s and  <dig> gsts. among these genes, two aoxs, one aldh, five cce, five ugts, eight p450s and three gsts displayed antennae dominant expression, and were proposed to be involved in sex pheromone components and plant volatiles degradation. together, our data provides a strong reference for the genes involved in sex pheromone biosynthesis and degradation pathways, and will be a useful gene set for future gene function studies. this data set may also provide potential gene targets to design pest control strategies based on disrupting pheromone-based behaviors of insect pests.
