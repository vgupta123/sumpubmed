BACKGROUND
mitochondrial introns are self-splicing, selfish and mobile genetic elements  <cit> . the mobility of these introns is often facilitated by homing endonucleases  that are encoded within the introns  <cit> . mitochondrial introns are rare in metazoa. both group i and group ii introns have been described. group ii introns are the least frequent. they have only been found in placozoa  <cit>  and in an annelid worm  <cit> . group i introns have been found in several unrelated cnidaria , porifera , and placozoa . as a case in point, tetilla sp. sp <dig>  and plakinastrella onkodes  are the only two sponges found to possess mitochondrial introns, although  <dig> complete mitochondrial genomes, representing a wide demosponge diversity, have already been sequenced  <cit> . a recent study of the lebanon sponge fauna suggests that tetilla sp. sp <dig> should be synonymized with cinachyrella levantinensis  <cit> . to confirm this view we sequenced a  <dig> bp fragment of the 18s rrna for both a tetilla sp. sample from israel and a c. levantinensis sample from lebanon . the same sequence was obtained for both samples. consequently, we use here the name c. levantinensis, rather than tetilla sp. sp <dig> 

the c. levantinensis cox  <dig> intron was found to be  <dig>  bp long  <cit> . unfortunately, the cox  <dig> sequence of c. levantinensis is not complete. using the complete cox  <dig> sequence of amphimedon queenslandica  <cit>  as reference, the c. levantinensis intron was found to be inserted after position  <dig>  this intron encodes a putative laglidadg protein. in p. onkodes two group i introns were found in the cox  <dig> gene but their secondary structures were not provided  <cit> . these introns are  <dig> bp and  <dig>  bp in size, and are separated by  <dig> nucleotides . the second intron of p. onkodes is inserted at the same position as the intron reported for c. levantinensis  <cit> . this intron and its counterpart in c. levantinensis share  <dig> % nucleotide sequence identity, have a similar secondary structure, and contain laglidadg orfs. by contrast, they share only ~43% sequence identity with the first intron of p. onkodes, which does not contain any orf  <cit> .

we have previously shown that the c. levantinensis intron was more closely related to fungi introns than to any animal intron known at that time  <cit> . hence we suggested that the presence of this intron in a sponge may be the result of a horizontal gene transfer event between fungi and sponges  <cit> . based on a later discovery of a highly similar intron inserted at the same position in  <dig> scleractinian corals of the suborder faviina  <cit>  and in the sponge p. onkodes,  <cit>  fukami et al.  <cit>  and wang & lavrov  <cit>  concluded, in contrast to our hypothesis, that this intron had most likely been transmitted vertically in cnidarians and sponges, but independently lost in most lineages. however, no statistical analyses were conducted in those studies, and it is thus difficult to determine which hypothesis is better supported by the data. interestingly, using reciprocal shimodaira-hasegawa  tests, a bayes factors test for incongruence, and a non-parametric version of huelsenbeck and bull's likelihood ratio test, goddard et al.  <cit>  showed that another intron, not related to the c. levantinensis intron and inserted at a different position, was horizontally transferred among actinarian cnidarians.

in order to better understand the origin and evolution of sponge mitochondrial introns we determined the cox  <dig> gene of  <dig> tetillid sponges and present statistical evidence that the c. levantinensis intron was both horizontally and vertically transferred in animals.

RESULTS
presence of mitochondrial introns and insertion sites
fifteen new and two existing tetillid cox  <dig> sequences from four genera were considered in our analysis: cinachyrella , craniella  paratetilla  and tetilla . to avoid bias we only considered sequences that included all the insertion site positions of both the previously discovered and newly discovered tetillid introns. however, since we did not amplify complete cox  <dig> sequences, introns present at the beginning  or at the end of the gene  would not be detected by our study. the complete cox  <dig> sequence of the sponge a. queenslandica was used as reference for numbering positions in the alignment. the use of reference sequence allowed a comparison of insertion sites between cox  <dig> cdss of different lengths, as well as between partial and complete sequences. among the  <dig> new sequences only five were found to possess a longer cox  <dig> sequence, most probably indicating the presence of introns. only the cinachyrella alloclada sample was found to have an  <dig> bp long insertion after position  <dig>  this insertion is similar in length and insertion site to those previously found for the intron of c. levantinensis and the second intron of p. onkodes . all other insertions are shorter and inserted at different positions of the alignment. two cinachyrella sp. samples from zanzibar as well as the cinachyrella sp.  <dig> sample from australia , have a  <dig> bp long insertion that is inserted after position  <dig> . this insertion site is similar to that of the first intron of p. onkodes. finally, the tetilla radiata sample has a  <dig> bp long insertion that is inserted after position  <dig> . interestingly, the introns present in the cnidarians palythoa sp. and savalia savaglia are also inserted at this position. a blastx analysis  <cit>  of the inserted sequences allowed us to identify a single laglidadg orf in each insertion.

intron secondary structures and sequence similarity
all inserted sequences were found to fold into the canonical group i intron secondary structure, confirming that the insertions are indeed introns. however, not all introns had the same secondary structure. three different secondary structures, corresponding to introns  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were reconstructed from the five sequences . introns  <dig> are represented in sponges by the introns of c. levantinensis, c. alloclada and the second intron of p. onkodes. they are characterized by an absence of p <dig> as well as large p <dig>  and large p <dig>  regions . introns  <dig> were identified in the three cinachyrella sp. samples from zanzibar and australia. the first intron of p. onkodes was also identified as an intron  <dig>  these introns are characterized by an absence of p <dig> and p <dig> as well as the presence of a large loop  in their p <dig> structure . it should be noted that the cinachyrella sp. and p. onkodes intron  <dig> structures differ in their p <dig> region, which is longer in cinachyrella sp. finally, an intron  <dig> was only found in the t. radiata sequence . this last intron is characterized by the presence of a p <dig> and a longer p <dig> than other sponge introns. in all introns most of the laglidagd orf is located in the loop associated with the paired region p <dig>  each laglidadg orf was found to contain at least one uga codon. this codon corresponds to a stop codon in the standard genetic code but to tryptophan in the "mold, protozoan, and coelenterate" mitochondrial code , refuting the possibility of a nuclear origin for the introns. it is worth noting that most mitochondrial genetic codes could code for a laglidadg sequence. it is thus not possible to determine the origin of the intron based on a genetic code. high sequence similarity exists among the introns inserted at the same position. the percentage of identity ranges from  <dig> to 99% between two sponge introns inserted at the same position, and from  <dig> to 53% between introns with different insertion sites.

the laglidadg phylogeny
to identify the evolutionary relationships of the laglidadg sequences encoded within the three intron forms, as well as their putative origin, a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed based on the laglidadg protein sequences encoded within sponge introns together with similar sequences identified by a blastp search  <cit>  . the endonuclease orf encoded within the intron and the intron section that takes part in creating the intron's secondary structure can have different histories  <cit> . in this analysis, the section of the intron involved in creating its secondary structure was excluded. consequently, the phylogenetic result allowed us to establish whether the laglidadg sequences encoded within introns of similar structure and insertion sites are closely related. the resulting tree was unrooted . the first intron of p. onkodes was not included in this analysis since it lacked an orf. the laglidadg sequences of sponges belonged to three unrelated clades corresponding to the different insertion sites and secondary structures, which suggest that the laglidadg orfs were transmitted with their introns. interestingly, not only the clade comprising the orfs of introns  <dig>  but also the clade comprising the orfs of introns  <dig> included cnidarian representatives . the clade comprising the orfs of introns  <dig>  in contrast, was not found to be related to any cnidarian sequence. another unrelated animal clade included only cnidarian sequences. the laglidadg sequences of this clade originated from introns inserted at position  <dig>  goddard et al.  <cit>  studied the co-phylogeny of the laglidadgs encoded within introns  <dig> and their host.

none of the animal laglidadg sequences were found to be closely related  to any fungi or plant sequence.

the cox  <dig> phylogeny
to identify whether closely related introns were hosted by closely related sponges, a phylogenetic tree was reconstructed based on cox  <dig> sequences  using the maximum likelihood  criterion under the trn + Γ + i model and bayesian analyses under the cat + Γ <dig> site-heterogeneous model  <cit> . the monophyly of tetillidae was recovered with maximum support . in contrast, most of the represented tetillid genera were found to be paraphyletic. more specifically, the representative of paratetilla was found to be closely related to cinachyrella species. similarly, the sequences of tetilla leptoderma and craniella sp.  <dig> were found to be more closely related to each other than to other representatives of their respective genera. these observations indicate the need for a closer examination of the tetillidae phylogeny, using additional markers and a larger taxon sampling. surprisingly, cox  <dig> sequences possessing introns did not always cluster together. while the three cinachyrella spp. specimens possessing introns  <dig> formed a monophyletic clade, c. alloclada and c. levantinensis, which possessed introns  <dig>  belong to distant lineages.

co-speciation between cox  <dig> sequences and their nesting laglidadg sequences
in order to examine whether the sponge introns were transmitted vertically, we checked for co-evolution between cox  <dig> coding sequences  and intron sequences  nesting within the cox  <dig> genes. such methods are usually used to explore co-speciation between two organisms . in the case of cox  <dig> sequences and their introns it is indeed possible to consider the introns as parasites of the cox  <dig> genes. since in tetillidae we have three unrelated "parasitic" introns , the history of each intron should be considered separately. because only a few species were found to possess an intron  <dig> or an intron  <dig>  our co-speciation analyses were only based on introns  <dig>  the cox  <dig> and intron  <dig> sequences of  <dig> corals and three sponges possessing such introns were considered in these analyses.

following goddard et al.  <cit> , we first conducted tests of competing evolutionary hypotheses. more specifically, using reciprocal approximate unbiased  tests we evaluated, for each data set separately whether the likelihood scores obtained under the intron ml topology  were significantly different from the likelihood scores obtained under the cox  <dig> ml topology gene . both the cox  <dig> and the intron data sets reject the h <dig> hypothesis that the two genes could share the same topology .

because reciprocal au tests are more adapted when node support is high  <cit>  we also applied a non-parametric version of huelsenbeck and bull's likelihood ratio test for detecting conflicting signals  <cit> . like the au tests, the lrt test assumes an identical phylogeny for the cox  <dig> and laglidadg genes. however, in this test both data sets are not considered separately. the test computes the difference between the likelihood scores obtained when both data sets have different topologies  and the likelihood scores obtained when both data sets have the same topology . this difference is then compared to a null distribution generated by non-parametric bootstrapping . unlike the au tests, the likelihood ratio test does not reject the h <dig> hypothesis that the one-tree hypothesis  is favored over the two-tree model , although marginal significance is observed .

the fact that the reciprocal au tests reject the hypothesis of co-phylogeny and that the lrt test is marginally significant indicates the presence of at least one incongruent node between the laglidadg and cox  <dig> trees. these results support the hypothesis of horizontal gene transfer of introns. however they do not exclude the possibility that in some clades a vertical transmission is the most likely hypothesis. we therefore also conducted a global test of co-evolution, as well as a test on each host parasite link, using the program parafit  <cit> . in this approach, matrix permutations are used to compare cox  <dig> and intron patristic distances. the analysis is thus unconstrained by the phylogenetic tree. unlike the au and likelihood ratio tests, the null hypothesis in parafit is that the host and parasite phylogenies are randomly associated, and thus that both data sets assume a different topology. hence, a significant p-value indicates the existence of at least one congruent host-parasite link between the laglidadg and cox  <dig> trees. in such a case, the tests on each host parasite link allow us to identify the co-speciating host-parasite pairs. this test revealed that the global co-speciation parameter, was significant , albeit low . only  <dig> out of  <dig> pairwise co-speciation links examined were significant, and again the link values were low . these three significant links represented the relationships between each of the sponges sampled and their intron sequences. when these three taxa were removed from the analysis, the global test indicated no co-speciation . the parafit result thus suggests that intron  <dig> could have been vertically transferred in tetillid and homoscleromorph sponges. however, this result is most probably an artifact due to the fact that only three sponges, belonging to different distant classes, were considered in this analysis. in support of such an idea, it is worth noting that the two tetillid laglidadg proteins are closer to the cnidarian sequences than to the homoscleromorph sequence . the latter result contradicts the current view that sponges are either monophyletic  <cit>  or that homoscleromorphs are closer to cnidarians  <cit> . it seems thus more appropriate to explain the distribution of intron  <dig> in homoscleromorphs and tetillids by at least two independent transfer events. however, we cannot exclude the possibility that this intron has been vertically transmitted in tetillids.

discussion
mitochondrial introns are rare among metazoan organisms. surprisingly, more than a fifth of the tetillidae species considered in our study  were found to possess mitochondrial introns. this indicates an unusually high number of introns within this family. more surprisingly, our findings pointed to the existence of three different introns within the tetillid family. indeed, each intron form has a different insertion site and secondary structure, and the laglidadg they encode belong to unrelated clades.

there are two characteristics that might explain the presence of introns in tetillid sponges. first, sponges, similar to cnidarians, have a slower mitochondrial evolutionary rate than bilaterians  <cit> . this slow evolutionary rate has been suggested to facilitate the proliferation of group i introns since their splicing depends on the conservation of a rather large sequence of nucleotides   <cit> . second, the transmission of genetic material is not restricted to the germline in tetillids due to their regeneration capacity  <cit>  and budding ability  <cit> . therefore, an intron acquired in any somatic cell has the potential to be transmitted to future generations. interestingly, although not all members of the phylum porifera reproduce asexually, homoscleromorphs, the second sponge lineage known to possess mitochondrial introns, also have a budding capacity  <cit> .

our results suggest that the family tetillidae is a hot spot for the presence of group i introns in animals. however, we cannot exclude the possibility that introns might be overlooked in other sponge lineages. indeed, two of the discovered introns are located within the reverse primer that has been recommended for the amplification of the barcoding region of the cox  <dig> gene in sponges  <cit> . as a case in point, cárdenas et al.  <cit>  failed to amplify the cox  <dig> sequence of c. alloclada using those primers, whereas we successfully amplified this species using different primers. this suggests that "standard" barcoding primers might not be adapted for the sponge and cnidarian species that share introns  <dig> and  <dig>  it is therefore likely that other sponge lineages might contain mitochondrial introns, in particular those with a budding ability, for example, members the genus tethya  <cit> .

two main scenarios can explain the distribution of these introns: one includes only vertical transmission while the second incorporates events of horizontal transfers. a scenario that includes only vertical transmission, as suggested by wang & lavrov  <cit> , would imply that the ancestor of sponges and cnidarians possessed no less than four different introns in its cox  <dig> sequence . the fact in favor of this hypothesis is that both introns  <dig> and  <dig> are shared by sponges and cnidarians. however, no species has been found to possess all four introns. except for p. onkodes which possesses introns  <dig> and  <dig>  all other individuals with introns in their cox  <dig> sequence possess only a single intron. since tetillids belong to the largest group of demosponges , the hypothesis of a vertical transmission of the introns implies a tremendous number of independent losses in most demosponge lineages, but not in tetillidae, whose ancestor retained three introns that were later independently lost in most tetillid species. clearly, this scenario is improbable.

various facts support instead the occurrence of horizontal transfer events within the mitochondrial genome of sponges. first, group i introns are known to be invasive elements that independently colonized the mitochondrial genome of numerous plants and fungi  <cit> . second, the reciprocal au tests  on intron  <dig>  and intron  <dig>  <cit>  support the idea that the cox  <dig> and intron topologies are significantly different rejecting the hypothesis of co-phylogeny. based on the parafit results none of the host-parasite link is significant within faviina corals, supporting the absence of co-phylogeny. the parafit results are not affected by either the node supports or the topology of the studied genes. it is possible that our parafit results are affected by differences in molecular-evolutionary rates between the two genes. indeed, the cox  <dig> sequences of the coral blastomussa wellsi and physogyra lichtensteini appear to have evolved at a faster rate than other coral species , although this result might be the consequence of a misplacement of the root  <cit> . in contrast, the evolutionary rate of these four genera is not at odds with those of the other intron sequences . such rate differences between cox  <dig> and laglidadg could affect the parafit conclusions, if they are not the result of a different history for each gene  <cit> . however, there are several points in favor of true phylogenetic differences between the genes. first, reciprocal au-tests, which do not take branch-length into account, reject the hypothesis of co-phylogeny . second, fukami et al.  <cit>  noticed an incongruence between the cox  <dig> and laglidadg topologies and acknowledged the possibility of horizontal transfers in scleractinian. it is therefore likely that the differences between the evolutionary rates of cox  <dig> and laglidadg indicate a different lateral gene-transfer in blastomussa wellsi and physogyra lichtensteini.

finally, although the laglidadg tree suggests that the sponge and cnidarian introns have an ancient fungal origin, the specific donor of the porifera introns is still unknown. no sequence except for cnidarian was found to be closely related to any of the sponge introns. a transfer from a cnidarian to a sponge or from a sponge to a cnidarian, as first suggested by fukami et al.  <cit> , appears unlikely in the case of tetillidae since these sponges are mainly found in sediment habitats  <cit>  and not in close proximity to corals. it is more likely that the same donor  was at the origin of the sponge and cnidarian intron.

CONCLUSIONS
our results support the suggestion that mitochondrial introns are both horizontally and vertically transferred in sponges and cnidarians. given the absence of a complete phylogenetic resolution of the cox  <dig> and laglidadg tree, the specific cases in which these introns were horizontally versus vertically transmitted still remain to be determined. among sponges, the family tetillidae appears as a hot spot of intron insertions, with three different intron forms present in different individuals. interestingly, two intron forms found in sponges are closely related to cnidarian introns, suggesting that sponge and cnidarian introns might originate from a similar donor. however, the mechanisms and the donor at the origin of this transfer of genetic material remain to be discovered.
