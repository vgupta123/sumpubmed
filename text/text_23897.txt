BACKGROUND
aerobic and nitrate-reducing bacteria can utilize acetone for growth through activation of the acetone molecule by an endergonic carboxylation reaction to form acetoacetate as a first reaction product . for example, the respective enzyme in xanthobacter strain py <dig>  acetone carboxylase   <cit> , activates acetone with co <dig> to form acetoacetate at the expense of atp. atp is hydrolyzed to amp plus pyrophosphate which is later hydrolyzed to two phosphates, hence, the reaction consumes two atp equivalents if the regeneration of atp from amp is taken into account. the acetone carboxylase of the nitrate reducer aromatoleum aromaticum
 <cit>  activates acetone with bicarbonate at the expense of two atp that are hydrolyzed to two amp plus four phosphate, hence, effectively at the expense of even four atp equivalents. aerobic and nitrate-reducing bacteria can gain sufficient energy from the oxidation of acetoacetate to sustain this energy input required for the initial carboxylation of acetone, in addition to the energy input required to sustain their growth.

acetone activation by the strictly anaerobic, dissimilatory sulfate-reducing bacteria  has not been studied in detail yet, and it is unknown how these bacteria perform the endergonic activation reaction. the overall energy derived from acetoacetate oxidation with sulfate as electron acceptor , appears to be hardly sufficient to support growth and activation of acetone via any of the carboxylase reactions described above. up to date, two acetone-utilizing srb are known, the deltaproteobacteria desulfobacterium cetonicum
 <cit>  and desulfococcus biacutus strain kmracts  <cit> ; the latter bacterium has been isolated from an anaerobic sludge digestor of a wastewater treatment plant.

recently, we proposed that d. biacutus activates acetone in a carbonylation reaction to form acetoacetaldehyde  <cit> . the reaction was followed in cell-free extracts of acetone-grown d. biacutus and requires atp as a cofactor, and co rather than co <dig> as a co-substrate  <cit> . the reaction product acetoacetaldehyde was trapped as the dinitrophenyl-hydrazone derivative and identified by mass spectrometry after a reaction of acetone, co, atp, and dinitrophenylhydrazine with cell-free extracts  <cit> . the reaction could not be observed with cell-free extract of butyrate-grown d. biacutus, hence, the proposed acetone-activating enzyme appeared to be inducible. however, this novel reaction, and particularly the postulated enzyme and gene involved, remained undefined.

complete genome sequences of several srb have become available in the recent years, for example, of the unclassified deltaproteobacterium strain naphs <dig> that is able to utilize naphthalene  <cit> , of desulfobacula toluolica strain tol <dig> that grows with aromatic compounds  <cit> , of desulfobacterium autotrophicum strain hrm <dig> that is able to utilize fatty acids  <cit> , of desulfatibacillum alkenivorans ak- <dig> that utilizes hexadecane  <cit> , and of desulfotalea psychrophila that uses lactate and alcohols  <cit> , as well as of desulfotomaculum acetoxidans
 <cit>  and of a desulfarculus baarsii strain  <cit> . only one genome of a member of the genus desulfococcus has been made available thus far, i.e. desulfococcus oleovorans strain hxd <dig>  which utilizes c12-c <dig> alkanes for growth  <cit> .

in the present paper, we report the draft-genome sequencing and annotation of the first genome of an acetone-degrading, sulfate-reducing deltaproteobacterium, i.e., of desulfocccus biacutus strain kmracts, and hence, of a second member of the genus desulfococcus. the genome information was used in a differential-proteomics approach to identify genes that are specifically expressed during growth with acetone, in comparison to growth with butyrate. candidate genes were identified that could be involved in the activation and degradation of acetone in d. biacutus.

RESULTS
general features of the desulfocccus biacutusgenome sequence
genomic dna of d. biacutus kmracts was extracted and submitted to whole-genome shotgun sequencing using a roche gs flx + system . sequencing and assembly resulted in a genome of a total size of  <dig> ,029 bp distributed over  <dig> contigs. the contigs were annotated via the integrated microbial genomes  pipeline . in total,  <dig> open reading frames  were predicted, of which  <dig>  were protein-encoding genes,  <dig>  genes coding for proteins with a predicted function, and  <dig>  were attributed to encode transmembrane proteins; only one set of rrna genes was found.table  <dig>

in direct comparison to its closest genome-sequenced relative, desulfococcus oleovorans strain hxd <dig>  the d. biactus genome appeared to be larger  and, most strikingly, contained a much higher number of assigned transporter genes  compared to d. oleovorans ; for example, more candidates of the abc-superfamily  , mfs-superfamily  , and trap-family  . furthermore, a higher abundance of genes for signal transduction and regulation was found, e.g., for signal transduction histidine kinases  , chey-like response regulators  , and pas-containing transcriptional regulators  . in total, eight crispr elements were predicted for d. biacutus, and two for d. oleovorans. in contrast, the genome of d. biacutus harbors less candidate genes for fatty-acid metabolism, e.g., for acyl-coa dehydrogenases  , enoyl-coa hydratases  , and acyl-coa acetyl-transferase  , with the exception of acyl-coa synthetase candidates  . the d. biacutus genome annotation also indicated a lower abundance of benzoyl-coa reductase candidates  . no valid candidate genes for alpha subunits of benzyl-, alkyl-, or naphthylsuccinate synthase  were found in either the d. biacutus or d. oleovorans genome, but glycyl-radical enzyme candidate genes were found that most likely represent alpha-subunit genes for pyruvate formate lyases . finally, we found no valid gene candidates for acetone carboxylase in the d. biacutus genome .

differential proteomics approach
we aimed at an identification of all proteins that are specifically synthesized in d. biacutus during growth with acetone, in comparison to cells grown with butyrate. therefore, the annotated draft-genome sequence of d. biacutus was used to generate a reference database for peptide mass fingerprinting . soluble proteins and membrane proteins were analyzed separately by two-dimensional  and 1d-page, respectively , and protein bands or spots of interest were excised for pmf identification. a differential total proteome analysis  of all proteins in crude extracts  was also performed in order to confirm and expand on the identifications made by the gel-based proteomics approach; the results can be found in the additional files 1: table s <dig> and additional file 2: table s <dig> published with this article.

proteins that were specifically formed during growth with acetone
proteins formed specifically during growth with acetone were separated by 2d-page for the soluble protein fraction  and by 1d-page for the membrane fraction . the gels showed seven prominent spots in the cytoplasmic and three in the membrane fraction that were visible only on gels of acetone-grown cells but not on the gels of butyrate-grown cells , and were excised and identified . furthermore, fifteen prominent cytoplasmic and five membrane-derived proteins observed on both gels, hence constitutively expressed proteins, were also excised and identified by pmf . five of the genes encoding the seven apparently acetone-inducible, soluble proteins  were found to be located on short contigs  termed gene cluster a and b .figure  <dig>

harboring genes that appeared to be specifically induced during growth with acetone. their locus tags in the img genome annotation, the corresponding spot numbers on the 2d-page gels, and a description of their annotation are indicated. the acetone-inducible genes identified via the differential 2d-gel-based analysis are labeled in red, and further genes that were identified in a differential total proteome analysis are labeled in green.

the pmf of prominent spot as_ <dig>  corresponded to locus tag  debiadraft_ <dig>  in gene cluster a  . orf  <dig> was also identified by the pmf of an acetone-inducible protein that was observed by 1d-page in the membrane fraction as band am_ <dig>  notably, the preparation of the membrane fraction involved four washing steps, hence, it is unlikely that band am_ <dig> resulted from a soluble-protein contamination of the membrane preparation. moreover, when comparing the intensity of the 2d-page spot  and 1d-page band  it appears that this enzyme is represented more prominently in the membrane than in the soluble protein fraction. however, for this protein no transmembrane helices or signal peptide sequences were predicted by img. gene  <dig> is annotated to encode a thiamine diphosphate -requiring enzyme . the identification of this tdp-enzyme and its induction during growth with acetone was confirmed in a replicate 2d-page, when starting from an independent growth experiment , and by the total proteome analysis .

the detection of this tdp enzyme suggests that tdp might play a key role as a cofactor in the initial acetone activation. tdp is known to participate in carbon-carbon bond-forming or bond-breaking reactions, especially with those substrates that contain a carbonyl group . in a separate study employing a fluorescent atp analogue as probe  <cit> , we could show that atp is converted to amp plus pyrophosphate, and that this reaction is stimulated by the presence of tdp. one could speculate that either the central carbon of  acetone is bound to the ilyl carbon of tdp for the subsequent carbonylation, or that tdp first binds the co before the carbonylation of activated acetone.

two genes that are located on the same contig, that is, in gene cluster a together with the tdp-enzyme gene  <dig> , were found to encode other proteins that were specifically induced during growth with acetone. one is orf  <dig>  identified by the prominent spot as_ <dig>  which is annotated to encode a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase protein ; these types of dehydrogenases/reductases  possess at least two domains, one that binds nad+/nadh or nadp+/nadph, and another one that determines the substrate specificity and catalysis. this enzyme might represent an nad+-dependent dehydrogenase that oxidizes acetoacetaldehyde to acetoacetyl-coa  <cit> . the identification and induction of this gene during growth with acetone was also confirmed by the total proteome analysis . the other acetone-induced gene in cluster a is orf  <dig>  identified by the prominent protein spot as_ <dig> , which is annotated as the cobalamin -binding subunit  of a methylmalonyl-coa mutase enzyme complex . this gene identification and the inducible expression was also confirmed by the total proteome analysis, in which also the n-terminal methylmalonyl-coa mutase subunit  was identified . this enzyme complex performs various types of reactions at the cobalt-carbon bond of its b12-cofactor, e.g., the relocation of the carboxyl-coa residue in the interconversion of methylmalonyl-coa and succinyl-coa. such a cobalamin-dependent step might play a role in acetone activation by d. biacutus if the  acetone is carbonylated at the central carbon atom to form first a branched-chain intermediate which subsequently has to be isomerized .

a very prominent, apparently acetone-inducible protein, spot as_ <dig> , identified orf  <dig> in gene cluster b ; the identification and induction of this gene during growth with acetone was also confirmed by the total proteome analysis. orf  <dig> is predicted to encode a zinc-containing, nad+-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase . a putative gene in direct proximity, orf  <dig>  was attributed to prominent spot as_ <dig>  and is annotated to encode a ‘putative redox-active protein’  of unknown function; the identification and induction of this gene during growth with acetone was also confirmed by the total proteome analysis. gene cluster b contains also two genes for benzoyl-coa reductase subunits, and genes for enoyl-coa hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase, and acetyl-coa acetyltransferase . the gene for acetyl-coa acetyltransferase  was co-identified by spot as_ <dig>  however, at much lower score . the gene for enoyl-coa hydratase  was identified with high score for protein spot as_ <dig> that appeared on both gels, hence, likely represents a constitutively expressed protein during growth with both acetone and butyrate. notably, all these genes of gene cluster b  were identified in the total proteome analysis, except for gene  <dig>  and gene cluster b appears not to be conserved in any other bacterial genome available within the img database thus far.

another prominent, apparently acetone-inducible protein, as_ <dig> , corresponded to orf  <dig> which is predicted to encode a desulfoferredoxin . this gene is on a contig with predicted genes  that might code for the following proteins: rubrerythrin, hypothetical protein conserved in srb, cytochrome bd-type quinol oxidase subunit  <dig> and subunit  <dig>  multimeric flavodoxin subunit, rubredoxin, uncharacterized flavoprotein , ferredoxin, and dsre/dsrf-like family protein. however, we could identify only a predicted desulfoferredoxin  as highly expressed protein in our gel-based proteomic approach . this complex is similar to the one found in desulfovibrio alaskensis g <dig> which also contains desulfoferredoxin  <cit> . the function of the entire complex is not clear, however, it may be involved in the protection of the cells against oxidative stress, e. g., by removing superoxide radicals .

the very prominent, apparently acetone-inducible protein as_ <dig>  was encoded by gene  <dig> which is predicted to encode the alpha-subunit of adenosine phosphosulfate reductase . however, this enzyme is relevant for both growth conditions since it is involved in the reduction of adenosine phosphosulfate to sulfite and amp. this gene is located in a cluster with adenosine phosphosulfate reductase beta-subunit gene , and also this gene was identified, both in acetone- and butyrate-grown cells, for the very prominent spot as_ <dig> .

a weak, high-molecular weight band am_ <dig> appeared in the membrane fraction of acetone-grown cells  and corresponded to gene 04339; it is predicted to encode a coa-acetylating pyruvate:ferredoxin  oxidoreductase. finally, band am_ <dig> which also appeared to be more prominent in acetone-grown cells than in butyrate-grown cells, corresponded to gene  <dig> and is predicted to encode a nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit rnfg. this gene is located in a predicted operon with the following genes: nadh: ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit rnfa ; electron transport complex rnf abcdge type, b subunit ; electron transport complex rnf abcdge type, c subunit ; electron transport complex rnf abcdge type, d subunit ; nadh: ubiquinone oxidoreductase rnfe subunit . the total proteome analysis confirmed that genes  <dig> and  <dig>  and, in addition, all other subunit genes of the rnfabcdge type complex were expressed during growth with acetone and during growth with butyrate . this rnf complex might play a role in the supply with low-potential electrons for co <dig> reduction to provide co as a co-substrate in the initial carbonylation reaction.

proteins identified for growth with both acetone and butyrate
the prominent spot as_ <dig>  corresponded to gene  <dig> for the alpha-subunit of adenosine phosphosulfate reductase . this gene is located in a cluster with adenosine phosphosulfate reductase beta-subunit gene  <dig>  and also this gene was identified for the very prominent spots as_ <dig> and as_ <dig> . the gene cluster contains also the gene  for the subunit a of heterodisulfide reductase and related polyferredoxins . a similar gene cluster was found in the genomes of desulfovibrio vulgaris dp <dig>  desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough, and desulfococcus oleovorans hxd <dig>  spot as_ <dig>  corresponds to gene  <dig> which most likely encodes a dissimilatory-type sulfite reductase alpha-subunit . the gene is co-located in a cluster with the gene for dissimilatory-type sulfite reductase beta–subunit , which was also identified by pmf . in the same cluster, genes are located that code for dissimilatory sulfite reductase d  and for nadh: flavin oxidoreductases of the old yellow enzyme family . this cluster is also found in desulfococcus oleovorans hxd <dig>  and desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough, and dp <dig> strains, and in desulfovibrio alaskensis g <dig> 

also all subunit genes of the atp synthase complex arranged in a gene cluster in the genome of d. biacutus were identified in both acetone- and butyrate-grown cells. these identifications were confirmed by the total proteome analysis.

band am_ <dig>  was encoded by orf  <dig> which is annotated as co dehydrogenase/co-methylating acetyl-coa synthase beta subunit gene . this subunit gene is encoded in a gene cluster together with candidate genes for co dehydrogenase/acetyl-coa synthase delta subunit , catalytic subunit  and gamma subunit , and candidate genes for a pterin binding enzyme , phosphoenolpyruvate synthase/pyruvate phosphate dikinase , and dehydrogenase . the delta and gamma subunit genes of the co dehydrogenase complex were identified in the total proteome analysis . this enzyme complex is used in d. biacutus for the oxidation of acetyl residues in the wood-ljungdahl pathway.

band am_ <dig>  was encoded by orf  <dig> which is annotated as an acetyl-coa/propionyl-coa/3-methylcrotonyl-coa carboxylase/carboxyltransferase beta component gene ; this observation was verified in the total proteome analysis . the total proteome analysis identified further genes on the same contig , for acetyl-coa acetyltransferase , isopropylmalate/homocitrate/citramalate synthase , acyl-coa synthetase /amp-acid ligases ii , acyl-coa synthetase  , and methylmalonyl-coa epimerase , each with a higher score for acetone-grown cells than for butyrate-grown cells ; interestingly, the co-located gene for a sodium-transporting methylmalonyl-coa decarboxylase  could not be identified. whether these enzymes are also involved in acetone metabolism or operate solely in amino acid synthesis remains to be elucidated in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of our proteomic analyses clearly document that d. biacutus uses a mechanism for acetone activation that is basically different from the carboxylation reactions observed in aerobic or nitrate-reducing bacteria. the genome does not contain genes coding for enzymes that would be comparable to the described acetone carboxylases . rather, our results indicate that acetone is carbonylated in an atp and tdp-dependent reaction to an aldehyde derivative which is subsequently oxidized to an acetoacetyl-coa derivative and further to co <dig>  the mechanism of the carbonylation reaction remains unclear at present, including the question whether acetoacetaldehyde is the primary product of this reaction. the acetone-specific synthesis of a cobalamine-containing enzyme indicates that a branched-chain derivative may be formed first which is later isomerized to acetoacetaldehyde. in any case, the novel reaction pathway is energetically more favorable for the energy-deprived metabolism of a sulfate-reducing bacterium: it probably requires one atp equivalent for acetone activation and a further fraction of an atp equivalent for co <dig> reduction to co employing an rnf complex to form acetoacetylcoa. the described pathways for acetone degradation by aerobic or nitrate-reducing bacteria require at least  <dig> atp equivalents to obtain this intermediate. one may speculate whether the novel concept of substrate carbonylation is applied also in the activation of other comparably stable compounds.
