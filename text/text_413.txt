BACKGROUND
the domestication of plants has been a key driver of the development of human civilization  <cit> . the necessary changes to plant phenotype and physiology have been brought about by a process of selection at key so-called “domestication” genes  <cit> . both top-down and bottom-up approaches have been taken to identify the genomic regions most clearly affected by domestication and selection  <cit> . the former aims to isolate the genes or quantitative trait loci  responsible for a given phenotype, and has been successful in identifying a number of major effect genes in rice  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> . bottom-up approaches apply population genetics strategics in which the focus is to uncover genes showing evidence for selection, followed up by attempting to link these genes to relevant phenotypes using a bioinformatics or a reverse genetics approach. evidence for selective sweeps has been discovered in maize, rice, wheat, soybean and sunflower  <cit> .

bottom-up approaches can be based on either a whole-genome re-sequencing program  <cit>  or by concentrating on a pre-selected set of candidate genes  <cit> . the whole-genome approach is powerful, but scale-up requires a major investment. typically, the number of accessions targeted for re-sequencing is less than  <dig>  <cit> , a figure which reduces the detection power and simultaneously increases the risk of false positives  <cit> . in addition, many of the snps identified by re-sequencing do not in reality signal selection, but rather are the outcome of “genetic hitchhiking”  <cit> . to overcome this problem, the “outlier scan” test has been elaborated; this widely exploited test permits the screening of a large number of accessions  <cit> . to date, “fst outliers” diagnostic of selection have been informative in several plant species, including sunflower  <cit> , maize  <cit> , white spruce  <cit> , and other conifers  <cit> .

in soybean  merr.), the traits most closely associated with domestication are a marked increase in the size of the inflorescences and in grain yield per plant, and an enhanced level of apical dominance. other traits that likely have been subjected to prolonged selection are the loss of testa color and increased resistance against a range of pathogens and insects. as in most crops, the effect of domestication and subsequent anthropogenic selection pressure has been to gradually reduce the genetic diversity remaining in the pool of cultivated materials. cultivated soybean was likely domesticated from g. soja sieb. & zucc  <cit> . the existence of a genetic bottleneck has been established through an analysis of allelic diversity at both microsatellite and snp loci as well as within genic sequences  <cit> . here, an attempt was made to apply snp genotyping to a panel of both cultivated and wild accessions to identify signals of selection, with a particular focus on testa color. the analyses reveal that combining a population genetics with a forward genetic approach provides an effective method to identify sequences that underlie an agronomic trait.

methods
plant material
the germplasm panel comprised  <dig> accessions of g. soja and  <dig> of g. max. the provenance of the former included locations within the proposed area where soybean was domesticated . the cultivated population comprised  <dig> landraces and  <dig> modern cultivars. a diversity analysis of all of the wild accessions,  <dig> of the landraces and  <dig> of the modern cultivars has been reported elsewhere  <cit> . the additional  <dig> landraces and modern cultivars originated from  <dig> countries and were included to broaden the level of geographic representation .figure  <dig>

data acquisition
the allelic constitution of  <dig> of the  <dig> accessions at  <dig> snp loci has been published previously  <cit> , and these were supplemented by equivalent data for  <dig> of the  <dig> loci with respect to the  <dig> added accessions ; the data were obtained using the illumina goldengate platform  <cit> . the gencall and gentrain score thresholds were set at, respectively, 80% and  <dig> , as described elsewhere  <cit> . on average, each accession harbored  <dig> % missing data . according to the soybean reference genome   <cit> , the  <dig> snp loci are dispersed throughout the genome, with  <dig>  residing within genic dna. about 38% of the genic snps lie within coding sequence, and  <dig> of the alleles at these loci are non-synonymous. testa color scores for the chinese germplasm were recovered from the chinese soybean germplasm catalog and various other sources  <cit> , while the remainder were obtained from the germplasm resources information network  database . testa color was considered as a qualitative trait, with five possible states: yellow, black, brown, cyan and double, following the conventional system  <cit> .

analyses of molecular diversity
summary statistics, including the proportion of heterozygosity in the population, nei’s indices of gene diversity and the frequency of major alleles were computed using powermarker v <dig>   <cit> . a phylogenetic tree was generated, based on a neighbor-joining analysis of shared-allele distances  <cit>  implemented in powermarker v <dig> , and this was visualized using a routine within the mega v <dig> software package  <cit> . population structure was analyzed using a bayesian markov chain monte carlo approach implemented in the software package structure v <dig>   <cit> . the admixture and independent allele frequency models were adopted, testing k values between  <dig> and  <dig>  five runs were performed for each value of k, without using previous population information. the burn-in time and replication number were consistently set to  <dig> .

identifying signals of selection
since the low density of snp markers  limited the utilization of a window-sized approach to detect loci carrying a signature of selection, the summary statistic approach fdist <dig>  <cit>  was adopted to identify snp locus outliers. the focus was on divergence at domestication loci, so pairwise comparisons between wild accessions and landraces, and between wild accessions and modern cultivars were made. a neutral distribution of fst with  <dig>  interactions at the 99% confidence level was assumed, and the significance level was set at 95%.

RESULTS
population structure and genetic differentiation
the addition of  <dig> accessions to the germplasm panel resulted in a slightly higher estimate of the extent of genetic diversity  compared to that reported previously  <cit> . the population structure obtained was consistent with a discontinuity between the wild and cultivated clusters , but there was evidence for introgression from wild to cultivated germplasm . based on mean pairwise fst values, the wild, landrace and modern cultivar subsets were judged to be genetically distinct . the extent of the differentiation was greatest between the wild and modern cultivar subsets , and least between the landraces and modern cultivars .figure  <dig>

detection of domestication genes
the presence of signatures of selection during domestication was inferred by comparing the allelic status at the  <dig> snp loci between the wild and the landrace subgroups . in all,  <dig> % of the loci were identified as snp locus outliers at the 95% confidence level . the fst values of the snp locus outliers ranged from  <dig> - <dig>  and were  <dig> - <dig>  fold higher than the mean fst value taken over the full set of loci . applying the same test to the comparison between the wild accessions and the modern cultivars  revealed  <dig> % of the loci to be snp locus outliers . in all, nearly 70%  of the w-lc outliers were also outliers in w-mc. the major alleles of the wild population in these outlier loci changed to minor alleles in the populations of landrace or modern cultivars . the strongest signal of selection was associated with the locus barc-022029- <dig>  at which the major allele was represented in  <dig> % of the wild accessions, but just  <dig> % in the landraces and  <dig> % in the modern cultivars.figure  <dig>

in addition to the  <dig> shared snp locus outliers, there were 11 w-lc- and 29 w-mc-specific ones. the frequencies of the major allele at most of the w-mc-specific loci decreased step-wise from wild accessions to landraces to modern cultivars , indicating that these loci may be linked to genes/qtl subjected to prolonged selection during post domestication. the 11 w-lc-specific snp locus outliers may represent domestication genes not subjected to selection during post domestication.

the genomic location of each of the  <dig> snp locus outliers was obtained by querying the cv. williams  <dig> whole genome sequence  with the sequences flanking the snp. this analysis identified regions on  <dig> of the  <dig> chromosomes . chromosome  <dig>  harbored the largest number of snp locus outliers  . nine of the outliers mapped to intergenic regions. of the  <dig> genic outliers, one was located in 5′-utr,  <dig> in 3′-utrs,  <dig> in introns and  <dig>  within coding sequences. among the latter,  <dig> were non-synonymous. based on go analysis, gene function was assignable to  <dig> of the w-lc + mc sequences harboring an snp locus outlier  <cit> . eleven of the genes, including five of the  <dig> genes harboring a non-synonymous snp, were associated with the abiotic stress response .

association analysis for testa color
most domesticated soybean materials are yellow-seeded, while black testa types predominate in wild accessions . in the present germplasm panel,  <dig> of the  <dig> wild accessions were black-seeded, and  <dig> of the  <dig> domesticated ones were yellow-seeded. the yellow testa trait was more frequent in the set of modern cultivars than in the set of landraces . a comparison of snp genotype with testa color across the full set of  <dig> accessions identified ten snp loci potentially linked to the trait . of these, eight were w-lc + mc snp locus outliers and two were w-mc-specific outliers. an analysis of the distribution of testa color and snp locus outlier allele within the three populations  is given in additional file  <dig>  allele frequencies at nine of the ten loci  were correlated with testa color in the wild accession and modern cultivar populations, but the correlation was only retained for two of the loci  when all three populations were considered . with respect to barc-018681- <dig>   <dig> % of the black testa wild accessions and  <dig> % of the black testa landraces harbored the a allele, while  <dig> % of the yellow testa landraces and  <dig> % of the yellow testa modern cultivars carried the g allele. similarly at barc-018093- <dig>   <dig> % of the black testa wild accessions and  <dig> % of the black testa landraces harbored the a allele, while  <dig> % of yellow testa landraces and  <dig> % of the yellow testa modern cultivars carried the g allele. four genotype combinations were recognized: gen- <dig> , gen- <dig> , gen- <dig> , and gen- <dig> . the association between genotype combination and testa color was somewhat stronger than those based on a single locus:  <dig> % of gen- <dig> accessions were black seeded, while  <dig> % of gen- <dig> ones were yellow seeded .figure  <dig>

discussion
the strong selection pressure applied particularly during crop domestication and later subsequent genetic improvement has greatly narrowed the genetic base of cultivated types  <cit> . the current analysis identified  <dig> snp locus outliers at which there was a significant difference  in diversity between wild and cultivated soybean populations, but failed to establish any clear distinction between landraces and modern cultivars, consistent with the conclusion drawn in previous diversity studies that wild germplasm has become more strongly differentiated from landraces than landraces have become from modern cultivars  <cit> . a pedigree analysis has established that landraces have provided more than 76% of the nuclear genome carried by  <dig>  chinese modern cultivars released over the period 1923– <dig>  <cit> .

even though selection signals have been identified in a number of genes, it is uncertain whether they are in reality identifying the presence of a domestication-associated genetic bottleneck  <cit>  as opposed to reflecting the long term outcome of genetic improvement  <cit> . ssr markers in the vicinity of qtl underlying traits of agronomic importance tend to show a stronger level of genetic differentiation between wild and cultivated types than those unlinked to a known qtl  <cit> . when the location of the present snp set was aligned with domestication-related qtl, it was established that six snp locus outliers were linked to a domestication qtl, controlling the traits such as twining habit, maturity time, flower color, seed weight, protein content and resistance to soybean cyst nematode  <cit>  . in addition, eight of the snp locus outliers are located around  <dig> mbp distant from a qtl mapped in a population bred from a cross between a wild accession and a cultivated line  <cit> . thus, it is likely that several of the snp locus outliers identified here will have contributed to the phenotypic differentiation between wild and cultivated soybeans. snps barc-025897- <dig>  barc-031461-  <dig> and barc-022043- <dig> used in this study are located around  <dig> mbp distant from an isoflavone synthase  gene , which controls isoflavone accumulation and is most expressed in the developing seed in soybean  <cit> . as isoflavone was not subject to selection during domestication, we used these snps to evaluate whether there exists a big change to detect false positive outliers. we observed for none of the relevant snps significant outliers, which suggests that our study is only marginally afflicted with an inflated rate of false-positives.

testa color in soybean is controlled by five genes, namely i, t, w <dig>  r and o  <cit> . a screen of  <dig> cultivated and  <dig> wild accessions based on sequence variation within the testa color-associated genes encoding flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase  and flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase  has shown that the joint allele constitution was more predictive of testa color than was the allelic state at either one of the two genes on its own  <cit> . here, two snp locus outliers  were associated with testa color. one of the resulting four genptype combinations  was carried by  <dig> % of the yellow testa accessions, a slightly lower proportion than was associated with a differently constituted haplotype  <cit> ; at the same time,  <dig> % of the black-seeded accessions carried gen- <dig>  a rather higher proportion than was recorded for the differently constituted haplotype  <cit> .

some of the snp locus outliers represent potential markers for other aspects of morphological differentiation between g. max and g. soja. cultivated soybean plants are shorter and more compact than wild soybean plants, characteristics which better fit the requirements of modern soybean production systems. one of the outliers  mapped within the 3′ utr of glyma15g <dig>  a gene which encodes a saur-like auxin-responsive protein family, and which is linked to a qtl controlling plant height  <cit> . members of this gene family have been associated with the determination of flowering time and the regulation of growth and plant architecture  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
genetic variation is the sine qua non for crop improvement. the domestication of soybean and the subsequent prolonged period of selection have resulted in a major loss in its genetic diversity. an overly narrow genetic base compromises the potential for achieving continuing gains from selection, underlining the importance of germplasm conservation, particularly of wild forms. at the same time, the identification of which genes were involved in domestication is required to recognize novel genes/alleles likely to contribute to soybean improvement. the snp locus outliers identified here should not only aid in elaborating rational strategies for the conservation of wild germplasm  <cit> , but may well also provide a source of markers suitable for the application of molecular breeding aimed at broadening the genetic base of soybean.
