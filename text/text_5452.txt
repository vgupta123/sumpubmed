BACKGROUND
bloodstream infections  caused by candida species remain a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly within the immunocompromised population  <cit> . overall, candida species have been identified as the most common fungal pathogen found in bloodstream infections in the united states, and are the fourth most common organism responsible for all bsi, and are the third most common within the intensive care unit   <cit> . candidaemia is often associated with the ability of candida to adhere to and form biofilms on indwelling medical devices, such as central venous catheters  and prosthesis  <cit> . biofilms are a population of microorganisms attached to one another and/or a surface, surrounded by an extracellular matrix   <cit> .

a defining feature of biofilms is their resistance to antimicrobial therapy, with higher drug concentrations required to kill biofilms and their dispersed cells when compared to equivalent free-floating planktonic cells  <cit> . another feature of c. albicans biofilms is their enhanced pathogenicity. for example, cells detaching from biofilms have been shown to be more cytotoxic than their planktonic counterparts and significantly increase mortality within a murine model of infection  <cit> . these observations have been demonstrated clinically, where a significant association was observed between c. albicans biofilm formation and mortality rates in candidaemia patients  <cit> .

whilst there is growing evidence of the importance of candida biofilms in clinical medicine, not all clinical isolates are able to form biofilms. there is therefore a fundamental gap in understanding exactly what drives biofilm formation and its clinical implications. establishing methods to differentiate these isolates is challenging, as many studies rely on either metabolic assays or biomass, and these frequently use a variety of different substrates and media  <cit> . therefore, comparison between these studies is not possible, and further interpretation of the data to improve clinical management both for diagnostics and antifungal therapy is limited. the purpose of this study was therefore to investigate and characterise biofilm formation by clinical isolates of c. albicans using standard methodologies and subsequently analyse biofilm subsets phenotypically and transcriptionally. here we report that c. albicans clinical isolates form biofilms that are heterogeneous, and this is associated with altered antifungal drug sensitivity and pathogenic potential.

RESULTS
candida albicans clinical isolates exhibit heterogeneous biofilm formation
c. albicans bloodstream isolates displayed heterogeneity with respect to their biofilm biomass when grown in rpmi . rpmi was shown to support the optimal growth of c. albicans over  <dig>   <dig> and 72 h . isolates were categorised as low biofilm formers  or high biofilm formers  if their biomass absorbance were less than the first quartile  or greater than the third quartile , respectively. those isolates in between the first and third quartile  were defined as intermediate biofilm formers. when hbf were stained with crystal violet , the extent of the biofilm formation was observed macroscopically, where the bottom of the well was clearly covered with cellular biomass . in contrast, minimal staining was retained on isolates classed as lbf, as demonstrated by the well remaining almost colourless. we analysed a subset of isolates from the lbf and hbf group  using dry weight measurements and confirmed our previous observations that biofilm biomass was significantly greater in isolates termed hbf  . these differences are clearly evident when viewed under a sem at low  and high magnification . lbf isolates were characterised by a predominance of yeast cells and lack of hyphal cells . in contrast, c. albicans hbf were highly filamentous with a multi-dimensional structure with very few yeast cells .

biofilm phenotype is affected by cell surface hydrophobicity 
the csh of lbf and hbf isolates was quantified to determine whether it played a role in biofilm forming ability  <cit> . figure  <dig> illustrates that the hydrophobicity of an isolate significantly alters its ability to form a biofilm. for lbf the csh increased by 32% and 31% in 4 h  and 24 h  biofilms, respectively, when compared to planktonic cells. this trend was also observed in isolates with hbf where csh increased by 50% in 4 h  biofilms and 81% in 24 h  biofilms, when compared with planktonic counterparts. furthermore, a significant increase in csh was found in isolates with hbf between early  and mature  phases of biofilm development, where hydrophobicity increased by 31% . when the hydrophobicity of lbf and hbf was compared, csh was significantly increased by 41% in hbf isolates at 24 h ; however, no significant difference was observed between isolates with lbf and hbf in planktonic cells and 4 h biofilms.

amphotericin b activity is impacted by biofilm phenotype
sessile antifungal testing was performed on c. albicans isolates with lbf and hbf to determine if one group were more susceptible to vrz or amb treatment. vrz was ineffective against all biofilms tested, showing no difference in activity against lbf and hbf . however, a dose-dependent effect was evident in all isolates tested with amb . moreover, a significant difference was observed between lbf and hbf treated with  <dig>  – 32 mg/l amb . lbf and hbf isolates both had a mic <dig> of  <dig>  mg/l amb, yet isolates with lbf were significantly less viable than those with hbf at this concentration . in addition, lbf isolates achieved an ~80% kill at 4 mg/l, whereas hbf required 32 mg/l to reach the same kill. no significant differences were observed in the growth rates of either set of lbf and hbf isolates .

in vivo pathogenicity is affected by biofilm phenotype
we next analysed the impact of the isolates ability to form biofilms based upon the severity of infection using a previously described g. mellonella model. the average rate of killing by three hbf, three lbf and a reference strain  of c. albicans were calculated to plot a survival curve. survival data showed a significant difference in the killing of larvae between hbf and lbf . after  <dig> and 6 days, respectively, >50% and 100% larval death was recorded for hbf isolates, whereas larvae infected with lbf only achieved 20% killing after 7 days challenge. the reference strain sc <dig> achieved 50% and 100% larval death by day  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. similar kill rates to that of hbf were observed in the type strain however, when compared to lbf there was a significant difference in larval mortality .

host-pathogen interactions in this model were then investigated by microscopically observing the morphology of the infected larvae at  <dig>   <dig> and 72 h post-infection with c. albicans hbf and lbf . at 24 h in both the lbf  and hbf , the nodule formation and melanin deposition were mainly observed under the cuticle and in the fat body, with mild to strong melanisation observed in the centre of the nodules, together with the presence of yeast cells and/or hyphae. the lbf nodules were smaller in dimension and dispersed mainly in the subcuticle area , whereas the hbf nodules had a stronger melanisation with the tendency to converge in large aggregates, and were localised more deeply within the fat body . at 48 h, the lbf were confined to the external part of the visceral organs, with a spot-like distribution ; whereas the hbf were found to display a pronounced filamentation all around the intestinal wall, with a pas positive matrix visible surrounding the hyphae . furthermore at 72 h, there was a substantial invasion of both the gastrointestinal tract and the tracheal system with damaged gut epithelium, where yeast and hyphal cells both observed in the hbf infection . in contrast, a segmental invasion of the intestinal wall  was observed with lbf infection and the progression of the infection was to a lesser extent than that by the hbf. table  <dig> summarises the localisation and characterisation of the nodules with lbf and hbf infected larvae. changes in the fat body morphology and composition including vacuolisation and haemocyte recruitment, were detected during the course of the infection and were more evident in the hbf.

transcriptional heterogeneity is associated with biofilm phenotype
c. albicans clinical isolates defined as lbf and hbf were further assessed at a transcriptional level and the expression of genes related to biofilm formation was investigated. act <dig> was used as the housekeeping gene and was shown to be stably expressed throughout all biofilm conditions. figure  <dig> illustrates the levels of gene expression of lbf  versus hbf  at both   <dig> and  24 h. overall, the majority of the genes tested followed a trend of up-regulation in hbf compared to lbf. however, statistically significant differences were observed in the glycosylated mannoproteins mnn <dig>  and mnt <dig>  at 4 h, where expression was increased by ~ <dig> fold. furthermore, the resistance gene cdr <dig> was significantly increased in hbf by 4- and 6-fold at 4 h  and 24 h , respectively .

clustering the expression of  <dig> selected genes from  <dig> different functional groups in a heat map showed their relationship with one another and their variable expression in lbf and hbf over time . here we found the adhesion genes als <dig> and hwp <dig> were closely related and highly expressed, particularly in hbf isolates at  <dig> and 24 h. furthermore, genes from different functional groups were closely related to one another irrespective of whether lbf or hbf, such as the proteinase sap <dig> and the adhesion genes als <dig> and eap <dig>  the remaining sap genes were all closely related to one another, and interestingly the resistance gene mdr <dig> and the cell wall mannoprotein och <dig>  further analysis of sap <dig> showed an increase in transcription within lbf at 24 h, despite no differences being observed at 4 h. in contrast, sap <dig> expression was consistently high at  <dig> and 24 h within hbf.

analysis of spearman rho coefficients found that out of  <dig> selected genes,  <dig> including those related to adhesion , filamentation , hydrolytic enzymes  and resistance  showed a significant positive correlation  with cv biomass data at 4 h . further analysis of the relationship between these seven genes and all the other genes tested presented various correlations . for example, plb <dig> was significantly correlated with all other genes tested  except zap <dig>  followed by cph <dig> , sap <dig> , eap <dig> , cdr <dig> , als <dig>  and zap <dig> . correlation of individual genes with one another at the 4 h time point showed that plb <dig>  cph <dig>  mnn <dig> and hwp <dig> all correlated with  <dig> of the  <dig> key genes defined above. notably, 24 h gene expression revealed very few significant correlations other than cv. in fact, a significant negative correlation was found between sap <dig> and the biomass data . furthermore, sap <dig> was positively correlated with mnt <dig>  and sap <dig> .

discussion
c. albicans is an important pathogen. it is the fourth most common organism isolated from total bloodstream infections  <cit>  and continues to carry a high mortality. the presence of medical devices such as central venous catheters  are known to be important risk factors  <cit>  suggesting that biofilm formation is a key feature in the pathogenesis of candidaemia. the past decade has seen a significant leap in our knowledge and understanding of the biology of c. albicans biofilms, particularly with respect to the molecular basis of their development and homeostasis  <cit> . however, in the clinical setting it is generally assumed that all c. albicans isolates have the capacity to form biofilms, but often with little regard to individual differences within the species when managing the infection. here we demonstrate that c. albicans display heterogeneous biofilm characteristics, and these strain differences have important implications with respect to treatment and pathogenicity.

previous studies have reported very defined categories in their analysis of association with clinical outcomes, i.e. biofilm formers and non-biofilm formers  <cit> . however, these important studies fail to take into account the heterogeneous nature of individual clinical isolates forming biofilms, which based on their metabolic xtt values can range from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> . when looking for clinical correlations with these phenotypes then important information can be missed, as the isolates at either end of the biofilm forming spectrum may lead to different clinical outcomes. we therefore aimed to evaluate and categorise c. albicans biofilms into distinct levels of biofilm formation to determine if their biological features were significantly different. initially we categorised biofilms grown in rpmi using a biomass stain  <cit>  and followed this up with dry weight analysis, which differentiated clinical isolates into defined groupings. this approach was used in preference to metabolic assays due to the highly variable nature of xtt from strain to strain  <cit> . moreover, xtt’s mainstay usefulness is limited to antifungal drug testing of biofilms  <cit> . our classification, based initially on biomass, was supported by observations on a macro- and microscopic level where it was clear that numerous cells consisting of hyphae and yeasts were visible in hbf, whereas scant layers of yeast cells were observed for lbf. we also investigated csh as an additional biofilm positive feature, as previous studies have also shown a link between biofilm biomass and csh  <cit> . this study confirms that csh impacts different phases of biofilm development, which is in agreement with previous work where it was shown that cells dispersed from mature biofilms were more hydrophobic than those dispersed from earlier stages of biofilm development  <cit> . furthermore, it has been shown hydrophobic cells are more adherent  <cit> , and therefore it is unsurprising that csh was increased in hbf isolates. based on our overall approach to biofilm categorisation we can be confident in the phenotypes selected for further detailed analysis. we do however concede there are caveats to defining levels of biofilm, and this requires further work and collaboration between groups to establish a standardised method.

one of the key defining features of c. albicans biofilms is their insensitivity to sterol active antifungal agents  <cit> . we examined azole treatment, which unsurprisingly demonstrated poor activity overall with no group differences, presumably through adaptive resistance mechanisms as previously described  <cit> . notably, amb was less effective against hbf biofilms than lbf, which we hypothesise is due to the inability of the compound to permeate easily throughout the dense physical structure of the cells encased within ecm  <cit> . we purposely excluded echinocandins from this study as these have been shown to be an effective anti-biofilm antifungals, therefore quantifying differences in activity against the two populations would be difficult  <cit> . these observations may have implications to whether a patient responds to antifungal therapy, as tumbarello and colleagues  demonstrated that inadequate antifungal therapy  and the presence of an indwelling venous catheter were key predictors of patient mortality and hospital length of stay in patients infected with biofilm forming isolates  <cit> . guidelines have also suggested that removal of the catheter is an important factor in improving clinical outcomes, again supporting the notion that biofilm formation has a crucial role in clinical outcomes  <cit> . given the importance of these infections, efficient and appropriate treatment in candidaemia cases has been highlighted  <cit> , as failure to treat quickly and effectively has profound consequences on mortality statistics  <cit> .

we decided to test the hypothesis that clinical isolates capable of forming robust biofilms were more pathogenic, which may be a reason for their apparent role in infections with increased mortality  <cit> . previous experimental work has shown that cells dispersed from biofilms are more cytotoxic and kill mice quicker than the equivalent planktonic cells  <cit> . using a g. mellonella model we showed that hbf isolates caused significantly greater mortality rates than lbf isolates, a finding supported elsewhere  <cit> . in addition, another study investigated the virulence of c. albicans isolates with varying levels of biofilm formation and found that mice infected with a lbf had increased survival rates compared to isolates that were infected with hbf  <cit> . histological analysis of the infected larvae displayed similar cell morphology of yeast and filamentous hyphae as observed in sem images of lbf and hbf, respectively. this is in agreement with a previous study that showed filamentation plays a role in killing g. mellonella larvae  <cit> .

filamentous growth is a characteristic feature of c. albicans biofilm formation. defective hyphal formation through deletion of efg <dig> has been shown to lead to low levels of biofilm growth  <cit> . given our growing knowledge of key biofilm related genes we decided to investigate transcriptional changes to determine whether these are truly represented amongst clinical isolates, and therefore could be used as a more robust way to categorise biofilm formation and as potential diagnostic targets of hbf isolates. act <dig>  the stably expressed housekeeping gene, as reported elsewhere  <cit> , enabled these relative comparisons. regulation of biofilm related genes were shown to influence an isolates biomass within clinical isolates, echoing work carried out by other groups  <cit> . cluster analysis of the selected biofilm related genes showed a good association with functional classes of genes, such as adhesins and proteinases, suggesting that both lbf and hbf had conserved pathways in the basic developmental phases of biofilm growth. however, individual gene expression profiles were inconclusive, showing very few clear independent significant differences, though gene expression proved interesting at 4 h. we investigated the overall biomass at 24 h and examined how 4 h gene expression related to this. overall hwp <dig> was the most highly regulated at this time point in both lbf and hbf, as has been shown elsewhere  <cit> , though no significant differences between the populations were observed. seven other genes were however shown to have significant positive correlations with biomass. the most significant was cdr <dig>  which was unsurprising as it has been shown to be transiently expressed in different biofilm studies, though does not correspond directly to antifungal resistance  <cit> . plb <dig> was showed to be significantly correlated with another  <dig> genes including biomass, though expression appeared constitutively low level within the biofilm, which is agreement with previous studies  <cit> , and may have an accessory role in the degradation of host tissue alongside sap’s. of these, sap <dig> was shown to be highly expressed in mature biofilms, and correlated with biomass and  <dig> other genes. we previously reported that sap <dig> was associated with higher levels of expression in in vitro biofilms formed from denture stomatitis c. albicans isolates  <cit> . in addition, nailis and colleagues demonstrated its crucial role both in a reconstituted human epithelial model and within in vivo biofilms  <cit> . furthermore, the role of sap <dig> in biofilm formation has recently been demonstrated in bsi, where its expression was significantly increased when compared to planktonic counterparts  <cit> . adhesins, such as als <dig> was also upregulated, which has previously been identified to be involved in biofilm formation, particularly at early stages of biofilm development   <cit> , where c. albicans mutants lacking this gene produce sparse biofilms on catheter material in vitro <cit> . eap <dig>  though showing no clear independent association with biofilm formation per se, did show a clear correlation with biomass and  <dig> other genes. its importance in biofilm formation has been reported previously  <cit> . of interest was the positive correlation with zap <dig> expression at 4 h, which is a negative regulator of matrix production  <cit> . it did positively correlate with bcr <dig>  the global regulator of biofilm formation, suggesting that the early interaction between their proteins may be important for downstream construction of the biofilm. collectively the data highlighted the importance of looking at multiple genes at once opposed to single gene targets.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, we have categorised isolates based on biological properties relating to biofilm characteristics, and evaluated these in models of infection and treatment, where we have shown clear differences in virulence. in an attempt to create a molecular basis of categorising these strains we have used gene expression studies, and showed that individual gene expression analysis of the biofilm related genes to differentiate and categorise biofilm-forming isolates may be futile. instead, we have shown that taking a defined panel of genes during early biofilm growth may be more informative. in particular, the panel of genes such as sap <dig>  hwp <dig>  eap <dig>  plb <dig> and cdr <dig> investigated in tandem could constitute an important step towards diagnostics of c. albicans biofilm formation, though the use of transcriptomics, such as rna-seq, may prove useful in identifying novel diagnostic targets. further work is required to determine why some patients succumb to c. albicans biofilms whereas others do not, as the hbf isolates do have an increased pathogenic potential and are more difficult to manage with antifungal agents.
