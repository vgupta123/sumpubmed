BACKGROUND
bovine anaplasmosis, caused by the obligate intracellular rickettsial pathogen, anaplasma marginale , is characterized in cattle by anemia, fever, weight loss and reduced milk production  <cit> . transmission of a. marginale occurs mechanically by biting flies and blood-contaminated fomites, while ticks are biological vectors  <cit> . approximately  <dig> tick species have been incriminated worldwide as vectors of a. marginale  <cit> . of these tick species, the southern cattle tick, rhipicephalus microplus, found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, is considered to be the most economically important ectoparasite of livestock  <cit> . r. microplus vectors several pathogens and a. marginale is among the most important, causing notable economic loss in milk and beef production  <cit> .

the developmental cycle of a. marginale was described in dermacentor ticks, and male ticks were shown to become persistently infected with a. marginale and able to transmit infection repeatedly when transferred among cattle  <cit> . the a. marginale development, multiplication in the tick and transmission to the vertebrate host are coordinated with tick feeding. within dermacentor ticks, a. marginale undergoes a complex developmental cycle that begins with the infection of the gut cells. after a second tick feeding, many other tick tissues become infected, including the salivary glands from where the a. marginale is transmitted to cattle  <cit> . although the developmental cycle of a. marginale has not been described for rhipicephalus  spp., the developmental cycle in r. microplus is most likely similar and males may also play an important role in pathogen transmission  <cit> .

molecular interactions at the tick-pathogen interface ensure survival and development of both the pathogen and vector. while recent studies on several pathogens have demonstrated that tick gene expression is modified in response to pathogen infection  <cit> , information on the function of the differentially expressed genes is limited  <cit> . rna interference  has been shown to be a useful tool for the characterization of the function of genes involved in tick-host-pathogen interactions and the transmission of tick-borne pathogens and for screening for tick protective antigens  <cit> . recently, genes differentially expressed in cultured ide <dig> tick cells in response to a. marginale infection were identified and their impact on pathogen infection in d. variabilis ticks was characterized by rnai during the pathogen developmental cycle  <cit> .

tick cell lines have been used successfully to study vector-pathogen interactions  <cit> . however, these studies were conducted in the ide <dig> and ise <dig> tick cell lines derived from ixodes scapularis embryos which is not a natural vector of a. marginale  <cit> . recently, a brazilian isolate of a. marginale was propagated successfully in the bme <dig> cell line derived from r. microplus  <cit>  which provided the opportunity to study the a. marginale-tick interface in the cells cultured from a natural tick vector.

the objective of this study was to identify r. microplus genes differentially expressed in male salivary glands in response to infection with a. marginale by using suppression subtractive hybridization  approach and to characterize the function of those genes by rnai. ssh enables identification of low-abundant rare transcripts through the comparison of two cdna populations by selective amplification of the genes expressed in one population but not in the other  <cit> . the results of these ssh studies were validated by real-time rt-pcr in r.microplus ticks and cultured bme <dig> tick cells for selected genes. finally, functional analyses were conducted on selected genes by rnai in both r. microplus male ticks and cultured bme <dig> cells to determine the putative role of these genes in a. marginale-tick interactions.

RESULTS
identification of differentially expressed genes in r. microplus male salivary glands
two ssh libraries, forward and reverse, were constructed to identify genes up- and down-regulated in r. microplus male salivary glands in response to a. marginale infection. from each library,  <dig> randomly selected clones were identified and sequenced. after removing vector sequences and eliminating est clones with poor sequence quality, datasets of  <dig> and  <dig> ests from forward and reverse subtracted libraries were obtained, respectively, and used for bioinformatics analyses. clustering and assembly of ests from forward subtracted library  resulted in  <dig> unique transcripts of which  <dig> were derived from two or more ests  and  <dig> were derived from a single est . assembly of the ests in the reverse subtracted library  yielded  <dig> unique sequences . automated annotation was then used to search public domain protein databases for putative functions . gene ontology assignments demonstrated that up-regulated genes encoded for proteins with putative functions of binding , structural molecules , catalytic/enzymatic activity , dna/rna metabolism , and 58% had no known function . putative functions assigned to down-regulated genes included binding , structural molecules , catalytic/enzymatic activity , transport  and 48% had no known function .

differential gene expression in a. marginale-infected r. microplus male salivary glands and cultured bme <dig> cells
fourteen candidate genes with putative functions in tick-pathogen interactions were selected for validation of ssh results by real-time rt-pcr . real-time rt-pcr analyses were done on the same pooled rna samples used for ssh. statistically significant differences in expression were obtained for  <dig> genes . similar to the ssh results, genes encoding for putative female-specific histamine-binding protein , flagelliform silk protein , kunitz-like protease inhibitor precursor , and proline-rich protein bstni subfamily  <dig> precursor  were significantly down-regulated in infected tick salivary glands. the gene encoding for the putative von willebrand factor , identified to be up-regulated by ssh, was shown by real-time rt-pcr to be significantly down-regulated in the infected tick salivary glands. for the other  <dig> genes, mrna levels were not significantly different between infected and uninfected ticks. subolesin , used as a positive control, was down-regulated in a. marginale-infected tick salivary glands.

to evaluate the use of cultured bme <dig> cells for studying a. marginale-tick interactions, the same primers were used for real-time rt-pcr analysis of uninfected and a. marginale-infected bme <dig> tick cells. twelve of the  <dig> selected genes were amplified from bme <dig> cultured cells. gene expression profiles were studied for each gene at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours post-infection  and compared with uninfected cells collected at the same time points . genes encoding for putative vacuolar h+-atpase  and ribosomal protein s <dig>  were significantly up-regulated at  <dig> hpi, while putative kunitz-like protease inhibitor precursor , metallothionein  and von willebrand factor  were significantly up-regulated  <dig> and  <dig> hpi. the mrna levels for the rest of the genes were not statistically different between infected and uninfected bme <dig> cells. the subolesin  control was significantly downregulated by  <dig> hpi.

all the tick sequence-derived primers were tested against bovine rna by rt-pcr. amplicons were not obtained for any of the primer pair tested .

functional roles of genes differentially expressed in r. microplus ticks and cultured bme <dig> cells in response to infection with a. marginale
the five genes corroborated by real-time rt-pcr to be differentially expressed in a. marginale infected tick salivary glands, female-specific histamine-binding protein , flagelliform silk protein , kunitz-like protease inhibitor precursor , proline-rich protein bstni subfamily  <dig> precursor  and von willebrand factor  , were selected for functional analyses in ticks. the effect of gene knockdown on a. marginale infection and multiplication in r. microplus male tick salivary glands was evaluated by rnai. the mrna levels after rnai were reduced for putative von willebrand factor , flagelliform silk protein  and subolesin , while silencing of the other genes did not result in statistically significant differences from the control .

atotal rna was extracted from infected tick salivary glands after rnai and analyzed by real-time rt-pcr to determine gene expression silencing with respect to control ticks injected with the giii dsrna.

bthe a. marginale infection levels were analyzed by msp <dig> pcr, expressed as msp <dig> copies per tick ± sd and compared between test and control ticks injected with the giii dsrna by student's t test .

ctick mortality was evaluated as the ratio of dead male ticks  <dig> days after dsrna injection to the total number of the attached male ticks, and was compared between test and control ticks injected with the giii dsrna by χ2-test .

the effect of rnai of selected genes on male b. microplus mortality was determined. tick mortality was significantly higher in groups injected with dsrna for von willebrand factor , flagelliform silk protein  and subolesin when compared with the unrelated dsrna-injected control ticks . despite the fact that individual variation in gene expression affected the statistical significance of results, silencing of the genes encoding for putative von willebrand factor , flagelliform silk protein  and subolesin  resulted in 63%, 79% and 60% decrease in a. marginale infection levels in r. microplus male salivary glands, respectively . characterization of the effect of gene knockdown on a. marginale infections in cultured bme <dig> tick cells was attempted for all the genes which were shown to be differentially expressed in tick cells and/or tick salivary glands. however, mrna levels were reduced only for putative ribosomal protein s <dig> , metallothionein , flagelliform silk protein  and subolesin  genes . of these genes, two genes encoding for putative flagelliform silk protein  and subolesin resulted in 12% and 17% reduction of a. marginale infection levels, respectively, when compared with controls . the knockdown of the gene encoding for putative metallothionein  resulted in higher a. marginale infection levels in tick cells .

atotal rna was extracted from infected tick cells after rnai and analyzed by real-time rt-pcr to determine gene expression silencing with respect to control cells treated with buffer only.

bthe a. marginale infection levels were analyzed by msp <dig> pcr, expressed as msp <dig> dna  ± sd and compared between test and control ticks by student's t test .

discussion
in the present study we identified r. microplus male salivary gland genes differentially expressed in response to a. marginale infection by use of ssh and real-time rt-pcr. development and multiplication of a. marginale in salivary gland cells involves molecular interactions between pathogen- and tick-derived molecules. salivary gland, the tissue of interest in this study, is a critical site in the developmental cycle from where the pathogen is transmitted to cattle. recently, tick salivary gland proteins were shown to play a role in the infection and transmission of borrelia burgdorferi  <cit> , a. phagocytophilum  <cit>  and a. marginale  <cit> . a. marginale membrane surface proteins involved in tick salivary gland colonization have been identified and partially characterized  <cit> . understanding the molecular mechanisms of a. marginale-tick interactions for r. microplus, one of the most important vectors of a. marginale worldwide, is fundamental toward development of novel control measures  <cit> .

some of the genes identified by ssh, including those genes encoding for putative tick cement proteins, female specific histamine binding protein, igg binding protein c, salivary gland-associated protein 64p, flagelliform silk protein and von willebrand factor, were identified previously in different tick species and appear to be involved in tick feeding or pathogen infection  <cit> . however, most of the differentially expressed genes identified in this study have not been shown to be associated with tick-pathogen interaction previously. some cellular functions affected by a. marginale infection of r. microplus, such as cell structure and enzymatic processes, were reported previously in infected tick ide <dig> cultured cells  <cit> . the discrepancy observed for some studied genes between ssh and real-time rt-pcr results may reflect differences between both methods for identifying differentially expressed genes or the presence of multiple sequences targeted during rt-pcr reactions that affect the results of mrna quantification for some genes.

in a recent study, genes differentially expressed in cultured ide <dig> tick cells in response to a. marginale infection were identified and functional studies conducted in d. variabilis suggested that these genes may play different roles during pathogen infection, development and trafficking from midguts to salivary glands  <cit> . some of the genes identified by de la fuente et al.  <cit>  such as gluthathione s-tranferase, selenoprotein m and ferritin were also shown to be differentially expressed in r. microplus salivary glands in response to a. marginale infection. however, these genes were absent from the current est dataset which could be due to differences in the system used for est discovery  and/or other factors such as tick species and/or a. marginale strain and infection levels.

while tick cell lines have been used successfully in a. marginale functional genomics studies  <cit> , this is the first report of the use of the bme <dig> tick cell line derived originally from a natural vector of a. marginale for functional studies of tick-pathogen interactions. since these studies were conducted on ticks and tick cells of the same species, most of the genes identified in tick salivary glands were also amplified from cultured bme <dig> tick cells. however, expression profiles of selected genes observed in cultured bme <dig> cells were not identical to that found in tick salivary glands. for example, the expression of the putative von willebrand factor  was down-regulated in tick salivary glands but up-regulated in cultured bme <dig> tick cells infected with a. marginale. these differences may have resulted from tissue-specific regulation of gene expression or because we only observed early stages of infection in the cultured bme <dig> tick cells . as reported previously  <cit> , results of studies using cultured tick cells must be validated in naturally infected ticks. interestingly, expression of putative vacuolar h+-atpase  was significantly up-regulated in a. marginale-infected cultured bme <dig> cells, as reported for previous gene expression studies of cultured ide <dig> cells in response to a. marginale infection  <cit> .

rnai was used in this study to assign the effect of selected gene knockdown on a. marginale infection and multiplication in ticks. although statistically significant for flagelliform silk protein  only, results of rnai experiments suggested that putative von willebrand factor , flagelliform silk protein  and subolesin could play a role in pathogen infection of r. microplus male salivary glands. rnai experiments in cultured bme <dig> tick cells provided further evidence that flagelliform silk protein  and subolesin may play a role in a. marginale infection and/or multiplication in tick cells and suggested that metallothionein  may be involved tick defense against pathogen infection.

the flagelliform silk protein was identified previously in tick and orb weaving spider salivary glands but its function was not linked to pathogen infection  <cit> . mulenga et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the flagelliform silk protein may be involved in tick attachment. in previous studies of i. ricinus after b. burgdorferi infection, the von willebrand factor was isolated from tick salivary glands and shown to be up-regulated but its possible role in infection was not studied  <cit> . a von willebrand factor-like motif is present in the major hemelipoglycoprotein found in ixodid ticks and this protein has been shown to play a role as a heme-sequestering factor during tick feeding  <cit> . therefore, silencing of these genes may affect tick feeding, mortality and development of a. marginale in salivary glands. however, as shown previously for subolesin  <cit> , gene expression studies in cultured bme <dig> tick cells have provided evidence that that the flagelliform silk protein may play a role in the infection of ticks with a. marginale.

the results for gene expression and silencing of subolesin in r. microplus male salivary glands and cultured bme <dig> cells infected with a. marginale reported herein are in agreement with previous studies in which subolesin knockdown reduced a. marginale infection in d. variabilis and cultured ide <dig> cells  <cit> . subolesin, discovered as a tick protective antigen in i. scapularis, has been shown to be conserved in many tick species  <cit> . subolesin was shown by both rnai gene knockdown and immunization trials using the recombinant protein to protect vertebrate hosts against tick infestations, reduce tick survival and reproduction, and cause degeneration of gut, salivary gland, reproductive tissues and embryos  <cit> . targeting of subolesin by rnai or vaccination also decreased tick vector capacity for a. marginale and a. phagocytophilum  <cit> . in addition, subolesin was shown to function in the control of gene expression in ticks  <cit>  and to be differentially expressed in anaplasma-infected ticks and cultures tick cells  <cit> . however, subolesin expression in r. microplus tick salivary glands and cultured bme <dig> cells was different to previous reports showing up-regulation in a. marginale-infected d. variabilis salivary glands and cultured ide <dig> cells  <cit> . these differences could be due to tick species-specific differences in gene regulation or to other factors such as pathogen strain and infection levels. nonetheless, these results expanded our knowledge on the role of subolesin in tick-anaplasma interactions.

metallothioneins are a family of low molecular weight proteins with a high affinity for divalent metals that function in cell detoxification, apoptosis, stress response and immunity  <cit> . metallothioneins control the cellular zinc ion levels, which are known to be important in the immune system, and their expression has been associated with protective response against pathogens  <cit> . the results suggested a role for tick metallothioneins in defense against bacterial infections. interestingly, selenoproteins that regulate the levels of another important trace mineral in the organism were suggested to participate in the cellular response to limit a. marginale infection in tick cells  <cit> .

although dsrna sequences used in this study do not contain any significant overlap with other known r. microplus genes, the possibility of off-target gene silencing effects cannot be excluded due to the limited amount of sequence data available. however, rnai seems to be very sequence-specific in ticks with little off-target effects  <cit> . availability of the complete r. microplus genome sequence data will facilitate screening for potential off-target effects. these can subsequently be minimized by avoiding the use of dsrnas or sirnas containing sequences which are present in multiple genes.

in our study r. microplus male salivary gland genes differentially expressed in response to a. marginale infection were identified by using ssh approach. recently a r. microplus microarray  has been developed and used for the analysis of acaricide- inducible genes in r. microplus  <cit> . microarray chip hybridization could be an alternative approach for identifying r. microplus differentially expressed genes in response to a. marginale infection.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a. marginale infection of r. microplus was shown to modulate in male salivary glands the expression of genes encoding for putative proteins involved in binding, catalytic/enzymatic activity, transport, dna/rna metabolism and structural molecules. five genes encoding for putative histamine-binding protein , von willebrand factor , flagelliform silk protein , kunitz-like protease inhibitor precursor  and proline-rich protein bstni subfamily  <dig> precursor  were confirmed by real-time rt-pcr to be down-regulated in tick salivary glands infected with a. marginale. functional studies suggested that differentially expressed genes encoding for subolesin, putative von willebrand factor and flagelliform silk protein could play a role in a. marginale infection and multiplication in ticks. additionally, for the first time rnai in cultured bme <dig> tick cells was used to study a. marginale-tick molecular interactions and suggested that subolesin and flagelliform silk protein may be required by a. marginale for infection and multiplication in these cultured cells. collectively these data are important toward understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in r. microplus-a. marginale interactions.
