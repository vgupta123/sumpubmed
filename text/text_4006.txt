BACKGROUND
genomic imprinting is increasingly seen as an important epigenetic source of phenotypic variation that may act in addition to or in conjunction with genetic sources of variation  <cit> . imprinting occurs when identical alleles are expressed depending on whether they were inherited from the father or the mother, thus causing a parent-of-origin-specific gene expression pattern where either the paternal allele is expressed and the maternal allele is silenced  or vice versa . differential expression may be more common than complete silencing of one allele and expression of the other. at the molecular level, imprinting is caused by differential dna methylation and histone modifications or non-coding rnas that, in mammals, is established early in embryogenesis  <cit> . at the phenotypic level, genomic imprinting is manifest in differences between reciprocal heterozygotes  as the only difference between these is the parent-of-origin of the two parental alleles  <cit> .

only about  <dig> imprinted genes have been formally described in mice , yet significantly more imprinted loci have been described in quantitative genetic studies , several of which show complex interaction effects dependent on environmental factors  <cit> . it should be noted, however, the discovery of imprinting effects in studies using allele substitution estimation  in f <dig> crosses  has been criticized for being biased toward the detection of spurious imprinting effects  <cit> . on the other hand, using dna sequence characteristics and a machine learning approach, luedi et al. <cit>  predicted that  <dig> of over  <dig>  annotated genes are imprinted in the mouse. these quantitative genetic studies provide vital information on the location and effects of imprinted genes that may then be followed up in knock-out studies for functional description and evaluation. perhaps even more important is that these studies illustrate that most imprinted gene effects do not occur in isolation but may show interactions with other genetic or environmental factors, thus establishing the biological network and pathways in which imprinted genes contribute to phenotypic variation. this can be achieved with knock-out studies only within the limited context of one or two loci.

the recognition that imprinting may be more common and important than previously thought has led to an expansion of studies in this field employing quantitative genetic approaches in addition to molecular studies. while early studies have focused on imprinted gene effects that occur during early development  <cit> , more recent work has demonstrated that imprinting effects are not limited to early development  <cit>  nor are they limited to tissues involved in maternal / fetal interaction. we now know that imprinting can affect body composition traits, growth, behaviour  <cit>  as well as cognitive abilities in mice and humans  <cit> . in addition, studies have now started to estimate how much phenotypic variation is explained by variation at imprinted loci, an indication of how important imprinting may be as a source of variation  <cit> . for example, wolf et al. <cit>  showed that pleiotropic imprinting effects can explain up to almost 6% of phenotypic variation alone.

traditionally, research on imprinting has distinguished only two patterns of expression, namely paternal and maternal expression, and many data bases of imprinted genes follow this convention . however, more complex patterns have been discovered  <cit>  with one of the notable examples being the callipyge phenotype described in sheep where one of the two heterozygotes shows muscular hypertrophy while the other three genotypes have normal appearance and do not differ from each other  <cit> . although some pioneering work on imprinting was done in livestock , the importance of this key epigenetic mechanism for traits of commercial value is only beginning to be recognized in research efforts. however, few studies have been able to clearly separate maternal genetic effects from imprinting effects  <cit> , which can cause the same phenotypic patterns  <cit> , and have assessed how important imprinting is in explaining phenotypic variation compared to genetic sources of variation such as dominance and additive effects.

in this study, we have used a quantitative genetic approach to identify imprinted loci that modulate key obesity and muscle traits  in mice derived from the berlin muscle mouse inbred  strains. we first scanned the entire genome for qtl that show epigenetic  as well as genetic effects . next, we determined whether parent-of-origin-specific effects are due to genomic imprinting or maternal genetic effects as only the former are true epigenetic effects. finally, the proportion of phenotypic variation accounted for by additive, dominance and genomic imprinting effects was calculated. our analysis enables us to investigate loci with pleiotropic effects and, at the same time, to investigate whether epigenetic or genetic effects are more important in explaining phenotypic variance in traits of interest.

RESULTS
we discovered genomic imprinting effects located on chromosome  <dig> with a strong effect on glycolytic potential and content. the imprinting pattern was bipolar where the two heterozygotes are different but the two homozygotes are not, consistently for all affected traits . the bipolar pattern is also reflected in the absence of an additive genetic effect, which is required for either paternal or maternal expression  <cit> . this is somewhat surprising as one might have expected a parental expression pattern  since these patterns are commonly assumed to be more prevalent. an additional imprinted locus was found for body weight on chromosome  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows two different patterns of bipolar imprinting expression. while body weight shows a pattern with a higher value for the maternal heterozygote , glycolytic potential and glycogen content have higher values for the paternal heterozygote .

a closer look at the genomic structure of the imprinted regions shows that the iqtl at  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig> comprises an informative haplotype block of  <dig>  mb  between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb where the alleles differ between bmmi <dig> and bmmi <dig>  this region is well represented by linkage disequilibrium in the f <dig> population with  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm on each side of the marker at the peak iqtl position. the next informative regions are  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb proximal and distal of the peak marker, respectively, and are only in weak linkage disequilibrium with the peak iqtl marker. with regard to the iqtl on chromosome  <dig>  the marker at the peak iqtl position at  <dig>  mb is located in an informative genomic region of  <dig>  mb  between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb. additional informative genomic regions are located between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb which are  <dig>  mb  and  <dig>  mb  distant from the peak iqtl marker, respectively. however, the marker at  <dig>  mb did not show imprinting effects. since the informative marker intervals on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> are small, we have high confidence in the peak locations and genotyping of additional markers would not improve the iqtl detection, neither in respect to position nor significance. frequencies of all four genotype classes at the peak marker loci are balanced  so that test statistics are unlikely to be biased.

we detected a further seven qtl on different chromosomes affecting variation at all seven traits . most loci showed pleiotropic effects , however, four loci affected a single trait only . although we identified several loci that affected overall body weight and the correlated traits fat and lean mass , two loci affected overall body weight only  but not fat mass and lean mass . six of the nine loci showed clear additive effects, followed by two imprinted qtl and one dominance locus. this pattern is evinced in the number of genetic effects for all traits: additive effects show up  <dig> times, imprinting effects nine times and dominance effects only five times .

next, we calculated the proportion of phenotypic variation explained by individual loci and their effects . because our qtl model is orthogonal we can add up the proportion explained by individual effects  <cit> . table  <dig> also summarizes the pleiotropic qtl effects observed at most loci by giving the number of loci and their individual effects. interestingly, variation for glycolytic potential and content are modulated only by genomic imprinting effects. it can be seen that our detected qtl explain up to 40% of phenotypic variation . for the majority of traits, additive effects explain most of the variation. however, for body weight and muscle mass, dominance and imprinting effects contribute a significant proportion to the overall variation explained. the imprinted loci have relatively strong qtl effects, individually accounting for 4% to  <dig> % of variation.

discussion
the key result of this study is that genomic imprinting effects but not genetic variation affects glycolytic potential and glycogen content in the bmm mouse lines selected for divergent muscle traits. we discovered a further seven loci with additive and dominance effects that modulate variation in muscle and obesity traits. overall, variation at our nine loci accounted for up to 40% of phenotypic variation, a considerable amount. there was a clear distinction between the three loci that exert strong pleiotropic effects  and those that affect only one trait .

the results of this study clearly further strengthen the evidence for the role of genomic imprinting at later life stages : the imprinting effects found here were manifest at 10 weeks of age, well into adulthood for these mice. moreover, the patterns at the two imprinted loci were not the traditional paternal or maternal expression pattern. another deviation from previously held views is that imprinted genes are predicted to mainly affect resource transfer between mother and utero . however, here we can demonstrate that genomic imprinting affects physiological traits, in line with recent research showing imprinting effects on body composition and other complex traits  <cit> .

the confidence regions of our imprinted qtl do not encompass any known imprinted genes . however, rna-seqence analysis of brain tissues by gregg and colleagues  <cit>  revealed a much greater number of loci that show parent-of-origin specific differences in gene expression. bearing in mind that these data are from different tissues compared to our phenotypes, we do find that our two imprinted loci  are within regions identified by gregg and colleagues in the hypothalamus and the medical prefrontal cortex . however, the expression patterns for our loci are clearly bipolar whereas gregg and colleagues only distinguish parental expression patterns. for our tissues, we thus regard our iqtl as novel imprinted loci, which warrant further investigation both in model systems and at the molecular level. however, mc <dig>  showing additive effects for multiple muscle traits is within the confidence region of previously found additive qtl for body weight, lean mass and fat mass  <cit> , and also in line with the qtl on chromosome  <dig> for growth found by brockmann et al. <cit> . the finding of bipolar imprinting effects on glycogen content and glycogen potential together with the absence of other genetic effects is intriguing, showing that imprinting can play an important role in modulating physiological traits of importance in livestock breeding. glycogen content and glycolytic potential are determinant factors in meat quality  <cit> , affecting the ultimate ph of meat, which, in turn, affects other quality traits such as water holding capacity, incidence of spoilage  <cit>  and meat quality  <cit> . a mutation in the prkag <dig> gene in hampshire pigs, for example, causes high glycogen content in skeletal muscle, which has beneficial effects on meat content but detrimental effects on processing yield  <cit> .

results of our analysis of the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by additive, dominance and imprinting effects contrasts with results of weight traits in a different population generated from mouse lines divergent for body weight at day  <dig>  <cit> . in this study, most traits were affected by additive, dominance and imprinting effects with additive effects explaining most of the variation, followed by dominance and imprinting effects. by contrast, the genetic architecture of muscle and fat traits described in the present study is different, although clearly a large part of body weight. here, few dominance effects  were detected, followed by imprinting effects , and  <dig> additive effects across all traits. moreover, genomic imprinting was the only significant source of variation at glycogen content and glycolytic potential, explaining ~ <dig> % of variation. this result warrants further investigation, in particular, whether selection for muscle traits may have resulted in selection at imprinted loci. given that the imprinting pattern is bipolar, i.e. there is no additive effect , it will be intriguing to explore how selection may have resulted in such an imprinting pattern or whether alternative explanations need to be invoked. this point seems particularly relevant to livestock production in which special breeding schemes are often used to benefit from heterosis effects and this paper contributes to encircle relevant regions for commercially important traits.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that variation in key physiological traits such as glycogen content is modified by parent-of-origin-dependent gene expression or genomic imprinting but not by genetic variation. these results further demonstrate that imprinting effects are not limited to early developmental phenotypes nor that imprinting occurs predominantly as paternal or maternal expression.
