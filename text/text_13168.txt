BACKGROUND
echinacea spp., commonly known as purple coneflower, is indigenous to north america. the use of echinacea spp. as an herbal remedy originated in the medicinal culture of north american indians during the 17th century and was later introduced to europe. its use became popular again in the early 1990s and continues today. currently, echinacea extracts from whole plant or specific tissue  are among the top-selling medicinal or food supplement products in the united states and europe  <cit> . recent studies have shown that treatment with specific echinacea extracts activates macrophages, natural killer cells, or other immune cells  <cit> . echinacea extracts have also been reported to stimulate the secretion of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon, interleukin- <dig> and interleukin- <dig>  <cit> . in vivo studies have shown that treatment with echinacea extracts can increase the number of white blood cells in the circulatory system  <cit> , enhance phagocytosis  <cit> , and trigger the alternate complementary pathway  <cit> . echinacea extracts have been marketed as possible immune stimulators or enhancers worldwide. these phyto-extracts have been actively evaluated in various clinical studies as candidate therapeutics or preventive remedies for upper respiratory tract infections, common cold, urogenital infection and wound healing  <cit> . however, the results from various studies on the efficacy of echinacea extracts for prevention of experimental colds or common cold have been controversial  <cit> . the most recent study, as a meta-analysis for evaluating the effect of echinacea, addressed again on the potential use and problems of echinacea as remedy for common cold/flu  <cit> .

dendritic cells  are involved in a spectrum of immune cell functions, including antigen-presentation and phagocytic activity, and play important roles in both innate and adaptive immunities  <cit> . dcs can capture and transfer molecular or cellular information from the body's outside or interface environment to cells of different immune systems. these cells are not only critical for the induction of primary immune responses but are also involved in the regulation of t cell-mediated immunity  <cit> . recently, a series of studies developed dc-based immunotherapy or vaccine protocols designed to elicit specific immunity against certain cancers  <cit> . echinacea plant extracts have been shown to have immune-modulatory effects  <cit> , and we recently reported on the possible use of echinacea purpurea  phytocompounds as immune-modifiers for human dc activity  <cit> . echinacea extracts have significant and specific modulatory effects on human dcs, but these effects are plant tissue-specific, the bioactivity varying greatly between root and shoot plus leaf  tissues. in this follow-up study, we further investigated in detail the effect of a partially purified and chemically defined ep phytocompound mixture on human dcs.

recent gene expression profiling in dcs have shown that dcs can actively process environmental signals and activate different transcriptional programs in response to distinct stimuli  <cit> . in this study, we used functional genomics to analyze changes in gene expression in human immature dcs in response to treatment with the butanol-partitioned fraction  of the s+l tissue extracts of e. purpurea  and cichoric acid  through affymetrix gene chip microarray analyses. high-resolution 2-d gel electrophoresis, maldi-tof mass spectrometry , tandem ms-ms analysis, and bio-informatics database systems were subsequently employed for proteomics studies in parallel with the genomics studies. results from these analyses and cell-based bioactivity-guide assays suggest that groups of differentially expressed genes, specific functional genes, and the associated molecular signaling networks can be employed as potential targets for future systematic studies of the response of human dc systems, as a response to traditional herbal medicine formulations or their derived phytocompounds.

RESULTS
effect of  extract on expression of cell surface markers in human idcs
flow cytometry revealed that  enhanced the expression of cd <dig>  a key marker for dc maturation in idcs, as compared with vehicle  treatment  and the percentage of cd83+ expressing cells increased, from 20% to 45% with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μg/ml . however, treatment with the ethyl acetate  fraction of the s+l extract at  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> μg/ml significantly decreased the percentage of cd83+ expressing cells from 20% to 0% . the observed effects were not caused by cellular mechanisms related to cytotoxicity, since mtt assay results indicated that treatment with ea  or   showed 98% to 125% cell viability as compared to vehicle treatment . thus, the  fraction but not the ea fraction could enhance the maturation of idcs. to reach this conclusion, it is essential for us to rule out the possibility that lipopolysaccharide , as a bacterial endotoxin contamination of the  extract preparations, might have contributed to the observed results in the present cd <dig> assay and the subsequent functional genomics and proteomics studies. by using a lal assay , we have obtained a firm negative results  on the presence of a significant level of lps in our  extract fraction. echinaforcetm, a standardized commercial product from swiss registered e. purpurea  moench fresh plant tincture, was reported to contain an endotoxin level of < <dig>  eu/ml, and this tincture was used in a randomized double-blind clinical study  <cit> . in comparison, our plant extract fraction, , was detected to contain a considerably lower level of possible endotoxin contamination . we therefore are confident that a lps effect on various bioactivities can virtually be ruled out from our present studies.

compound identification and fingerprint analysis of the bioactive  fraction
the overall metabolite profile of  of e. purpurea was analyzed using rp-hplc, detected at a <dig> or a <dig> . seven phytocompounds  namely hypoxanthine , chlorogenic acid , caffeic acid , cichoric acid , quercetin 3-o-rhamnosyl--galactoside , kaempferol 3-o-rhamnosyl--galactoside , and rutin  were identified by a combination of chomatography on rp- <dig> silica gel, sephadex gel, and c <dig> rp-hplc. structures were elucidated by 1h-nuclear magnetic resonance , 13c-nmr and ms, and confirmed with previous data  <cit> . lc/electrospray ionization-ms was further employed to establish the chemical fingerprints with two index compounds of . the rp-hplc chromatogram detected at  <dig> nm of  was shown in figure 2b  and the mass spectra of the specific compounds were further characterized by using their pseudo molecular weight at m/z  <dig> +, tr =  <dig>  min, compound  <dig>  figure 2b ; and m/z  <dig> +, tr =  <dig>  min, compound  <dig>  figure 2b . these result demonstrate that compounds  <dig> and  <dig> in  can be readily identified by comparing their corresponding peaks  and ms data.

the levels of cichoric acid  and rutin  were quantitatively determined for use as candidate index compounds for the  fraction. standard calibration curves  prepared for cichoric acid and rutin ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> mg/ml. absorbance of the compounds at  <dig> nm varied linearly within this range. the amount of cichoric acid and rutin were determined as  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , respectively, of the dry weight of the  fraction. together, the results show that this  phytocompound mixture was effectively standardized and defined with a specific metabolite profile containing several candidate index compounds . the standardized  fraction was then systematically used in the following bioactivity assays to evaluate its immune regulatory effects in human idcs.

affymetrix dna microarray analysis of differential gene expression patterns in human idcs in response to treatment with  or cichoric acid
for dna microarray analysis, idcs differentiated from primary monocytes in vitro were incubated with  or cichoric acid for  <dig> or  <dig> h to characterize early- or late-responsive genes. a total of nine oligo-dna chips were hybridized to determine the transcriptome profiles in human idcs. the array data was normalized for identifying differentially expressed genes, clustering and annotation. we selected  <dig> genes for clustering by gap statistic analysis. figure  <dig> shows a heat map of differential gene expression patterns and a plot of the resultant  <dig> possible gene clusters. the k-means clustering revealed that some genes exhibited a consistent response, for example with increased expression at both  <dig> h and  <dig> h after treatment with . alternatively, some genes highly expressed at  <dig> h but not at  <dig> h after treatment, or at  <dig> h but not at  <dig> h post-treatment, and these may reflect other sets of specific and differential transient gene expression patterns.

approximately  <dig> genes were up-regulated by ≥ 2-fold change in expression at  <dig> h post-treatment with , with  <dig> genes showing 11- to 31-fold change in expression . about  <dig> genes were down-regulated by > 2-fold change in expression at  <dig> h post-treatment . most notably, four up-regulated genes , and two down-regulated genes, ifn-α <dig> and leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor , are well known to be involved in various key immune-modulatory activities. changes in expression noted after  <dig> h treatment are summarized in table 1b. treatment with cichoric acid, a key principle component of the  fraction, gave a different expression profile in idcs. a total of  <dig> genes and  <dig> genes were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, with 2-fold change in expression at  <dig> h post-treatment . the top  <dig> up- or down-regulated genes, with  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold increase or  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold decrease in expression at  <dig> h were chosen for further analysis . at  <dig> h after treatment,  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated with ≥ 2-fold change in expression . the top  <dig> up- or down-regulated genes, with  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold increase or  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold decrease in expression at  <dig> h were chosen for further evaluation . as shown in table  <dig>  among the groups of genes up- or down-regulated by cichoric acid versus  treatment for  <dig> h, an overlapping expression pattern was observed for  <dig> genes.

putative signaling networks/pathways involved in the modulatory effect of  on idcs
to identify the possible putative signal transduction pathways, we analyzed, for  <dig> hr and  <dig> hr treatments, the top  <dig> up-regulated genes in human idcs in response to treatment with  using transpath soft ware. signal transduction pathways involving the mcp- <dig>  il- <dig>  ccl <dig>  jak <dig> and trio genes with ≥ 5-fold change in expression on treatment  was identified. signaling pathway networking and gene function analyses led to the hypothesis that treatment of idc with  may activate the cyclic amp and pkc pathways leading to the regulation of a key down stream molecule, adenylate cyclase  <dig> , in a ca2+ dependent manner .

construction of proteome maps and identification of differentially expressed proteins in human idcs
treatment of idcs with  <dig> μg/ml  or  <dig> μg/ml cichoric acid resulted in differential expression of  <dig> proteins  identified by maldi-tof-ms. these  <dig> proteins were further categorized by function with use of the swiss-prot database. most of the proteins responding to   were cell growth- or maintenance-related proteins ; these included structural and cytoskeleton proteins such as macrophage-capping protein, cofilin, profilin, f-actin capping protein β subunit, and laminin a/c . other major classes were energy pathway-related proteins or metabolic enzymes , proteins involved in protein metabolism or degradation , and ion channel/transport proteins . a small number were related to signal transduction and cell communication , and others were associated with the regulation of nucleotides and nucleic acid metabolism . some proteins of interest include oxidative stress-related proteins  and cytoskeleton related proteins . these specific proteins may warrant further evaluation because of their apparent roles in modulation of dc maturation and function.

confirmation of up- or down-regulation of specific proteins
western blot analysis was conducted to confirm some of the up-regulated proteins observed from proteomic analysis. the expression of mn-sod  was increased  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold with  and  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold with cichoric acid treatment at  <dig> and  <dig> h, respectively, as compared with vehicle controls, which is consistent with results from 2-d gel electrophoresis . the levels of cofilin determined by 2-d gel electrophoresis  were slightly decreased, by  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, with  and greatly decreased, by  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, with cichoric acid treatment at  <dig> or  <dig> h, respectively. interestingly, confirmation by western blot analysis revealed only a  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold decrease in cofilin level at  <dig> and  <dig> h with cichoric acid treatment . both assay systems revealed reduced effect of  on cofilin expression in idcs  . nevertheless, these results confirmed our finding that the expression of cofilin in idcs can be substantially reduced by treatment with cichoric acid and may be slightly inhibited by . rutin, another major index component of the , effectively inhibited the expression of cofilin, by  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold at  <dig> and  <dig> h, respectively, in idcs . treatment with  <dig> ng/ml lipopolysaccharide  conferred an approximately  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold decrease in cofilin expression as compared to controls .

discussion
results of some clinical studies are controversial about the effects of the traditional herbal medicine echinacea extracts  <cit> , even though recent studies seemed to provide some support for its possible beneficial effects for treatment of the common cold  <cit> . in addition, studies from animal experiments have shown that alkamides form echinacea extracts may confer immune-modulatory activities  <cit> . among these different observations, we believe it is important to evaluate systematically the specific and multiple effects of echinacea phytocompounds on human immune cells, at the cellular and molecular levels. previously, we reported that un-fractionated, crude extracts of e. purpurea plant tissues could affect specific cell-surface markers of human dcs  <cit> , which suggests the potential of using human dcs as an experimental system for in-depth study of the effect of echinacea phytocompounds on important human immune cell systems. in the current study, we evaluated and characterized the possible immune-modulatory effect of phytocompounds from e. purpurea, as an organic solvent-fractionated phytocompound mixture or a single major component , on human dcs. using transcriptome and proteome experimental approaches, we analyzed the global and differential gene expression patterns at the mrna and protein levels in human monocyte-derived idcs treated with test phytocompounds.

previous studies have demonstrated that dcs play important roles in initiating and regulating innate as well as adaptive immunities  <cit> . under normal conditions, dcs are present in most tissues in a relatively immature state, but with inflammation, irritation or danger signals from foreign antigens or environment, idcs undergo rapid changes and initiate a cascade of activities to defend the body system. the phenotypic and functional characteristics of dcs are intimately and dynamically linked to their stage of differentiation and maturation  <cit> . human dcs have been recently recognized as a promising cell system for ex vivo/in vitro tissue culture manipulations for potential clinical application as tumor vaccines for cancer therapy  <cit> .

initially, we used the expression of a highly specific cell-surface and dc maturation maker, cd <dig>  as a key indicator for assessing possible immune modulatory effects of echinacea extracts on human dcs. the butanol fraction  significantly stimulated but the ethylacetate  fraction greatly inhibited cd <dig> expression in idcs, which suggests a possible immune modulatory effect of  on the maturation of idcs and that different sub-fractions of the phytocompound mixtures/herbal extracts could confer different or even opposite biological activities. these findings thus strongly suggest the urgent need for a clear, specific and stringent definition of the extraction, fractionation and plant-tissue usage of the medicinal herb preparations and the derived phytocompounds for both laboratory experimental studies and commercial applications. the lack of such definition and information has already raised public concern.

since our results on cd <dig> protein expression suggested that the  may stimulate the maturation of idcs, we subjected this butanol fraction to hplc analysis to characterize the major components and some possible active compounds. we identified seven specific phytocompounds, namely hypoxanthine, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, cichoric acid, rutin, quercetin 3-o-rhamnosyl--galactoside, and kaempferol 3-o-rhamnosyl--galactoside from the  fraction. the content of two major compounds cichoric acid  and rutin  were quantified, and this data could be used as chemical fingerprints and index compounds for future study and standardization of the bioactive  fraction of e. purpurea. potential future application of the  fraction for use as remedy, nutraceutical or food supplement would have to wait until future studies are carried out with the considerations of appropriate dosage, bio-activity and defined immuno-modulatory functions to be assayed under in vivo conditions.

use of the affymetrix microarray analysis revealed approximately 10% of the whole human genome effectively expressed in dcs . a total of  <dig> genes  were differentially or specifically regulated during the differentiation or maturation of idcs. the top  <dig> genes with significantly up regulated expression  at  <dig> h post-treatment with  include some important early-responsive chemokine genes such as ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and il- <dig>  previously reported to play important roles in inflammatory responses  <cit> . although treatment with cichoric acid did not affect cd <dig> expression, as was observed for , it nonetheless up-regulated a similar subset of early response genes. additional analysis of genes with overlapping expression on treatment with both  and cichoric acid revealed that some of the interferon-inducible proteins, including ifi <dig>  ifi <dig> , ifit <dig> and the interferon alpha-inducible protein , were all down-regulated at  <dig> h post-treatment. thus, several key chemokine genes are likely involved in the early response to treatment with specific echinacea phytocompounds, and another set of interferon-inducible genes belong to the group of late-responsive genes. we also performed gene-clustering analysis to classify the gene expression patterns in human idcs. a total of  <dig> genes were grouped into six clustering sets on the basis of their expression in response to  . in contrast, cichoric acid and vehicle treatment produced no clustering differences, which suggests the lack of a multi-domain or substantial effect of cichoric acid on most expressed genes in idcs.

we have identified a hypothetical signaling network involving -induced early response genes such as ccl <dig> , il- <dig>  ccl <dig>  jak <dig> and trio . this signaling network revealed possible activation of camp and pkc pathways leading to the regulation of ac <dig> through a ca2+ receptor, calmodulin. previous studies have demonstrated that activation of camp induces dc maturation and migration  <cit> . pkc plays an important role in dc differentiation and antigen presenting function  <cit> . in addition, ca2+ dependent pathways have been shown to regulate dc maturation and migration  <cit> . our results on increased expression of cd <dig> maturation marker coupled with candidate signal transduction pathways strongly suggest that  may enhance the idc maturation and function, which warrants further systematic investigation.

2-d gel electrophoresis revealed  <dig> of the  <dig>  detectable protein spots  affected in idcs after 12- or 24-h treatment with . we suggest that this  <dig> % change in idc protein levels may reflect a marked change in protein expression, since the other cell types we have studied in parallel  showed only a 3% to 5% change . we observed significant up-regulation of antioxidant defense enzymes such as mn-sod, catalase and peroxiredoxin  <dig> in idcs in response to  and cichoric acid. endogenous antioxidants have been reported to play key role in dendritic cell survival, and ability to induce t cell activation and regulate the polarity of immune responses  <cit> . several cytoskeletal and actin-binding proteins  were significantly up-regulated in  or cichoric acid treated idcs. in dc, the changes in actin cytoskeleton components are essential for the formation of its characteristic dendrites and veils, as well as an immunological synapse necessary for antigen presentation  <cit> . in addition, actin cytoskeleton rearrangement is important for the motility and migration of cells and may influence the migration of dc to lymph nodes during their maturation  <cit> . results from 2-d gel electrophoresis  and western blot analyses  confirmed in general the trend of changes in differential expression of mn-sod and cofilin. we therefore hypothesize that a specific group of phytocompounds in echinacea may turn on the antioxidant defense system and regulate the rearrangement of cytoskeleton, which in turn may contribute to the positive enhancement of the immunemodulatory activities of dcs.

the present study has identified a pool of known or unknown genes associated with the differential expression of a spectrum of cytokines and chemokines and other immune cell activities in response to treatment with echinacea compounds in dcs . in addition, changes in level of molecules related to cell adhesion, immune-response and antigen presentation were observed in this human dc model, providing candidate target genes/proteins for future cross-talk studies of the biology of human dcs. these differentially expressed genes and proposed candidate signaling pathways/networks obtained via bioinformatics approaches have provided us with useful potential clues and molecular targets for future studies of molecular mechanisms underlying specific immune modulatory effect of important medicinal herb echinacea purpurea and derived phytocompounds in idcs.

CONCLUSIONS
since dendritic cells are well characterized and recognized as potent antigen presenting cells and have been shown to play critical roles in both innate and adaptive immunities, we have employed human dcs for functional genomics studies to evaluate possible immuno-modulatory effects of specific phytocompound mixtures from a popular medicinal herb extract, echinacea purpurea. specific and differential gene expression patterns were detected in time-course experiments of idcs treated with the bioactive phytocompound fraction  and its major index compound . transcritome analyses showed significant up regulation of specific chemokine and cytokine genes, including cxcl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  il- <dig>  il-1β and il- <dig>  within  <dig> h after  treatment of idcs. bioinformatics studies suggested that a key molecular signaling network involving a number of the detected immune-modifier genes may lead to the activation of a downstream adenylate cyclase  <dig> activities, contributing to the observed cellular and molecular activities in test cells. subsequent proteomic studies further showed that expression of specific antioxidation and cytoskeletal proteins, known to play important cellular physiological roles in dcs, are increased in cichoric acid or -treated cells. based on these results, we conclude from this study that specific phytocompound mixtures present as major or active components in the test traditional herb may confer defined and significant immuno-modulatory effects on specific immune cell types. the candidate target molecules and molecular signaling mechanisms identified from this and previous study  <cit>  provide us with useful information and hypothesis for future studies on characterization of human dcs in response to treatment with medicinal phytocompounds at the transcriptome and proteome levels.
