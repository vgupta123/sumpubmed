BACKGROUND
despite the high frequency of horizontal sequence transfer in the pneumococcal population, the spread of multidrug-resistant  streptococcus pneumoniae has primarily reflected the global dissemination of particular clones rather than the acquisition of resistance by resident, sensitive genotypes
 <cit> . mdr pneumococci were first identified in 1977
 <cit> , with the phenotype becoming very common in some countries during the 1980s due to the spread of several mdr clones
 <cit> . however, the absence of such bacteria from iceland meant no penicillin resistance was detected among s. pneumoniae on the island until december 1988
 <cit> . this was in spite of the country having the highest per capita consumption of antibiotics of the nordic countries at the time
 <cit> .

levels of resistance subsequently rose to a peak in  <dig>  by which point  <dig> % of icelandic clinical pneumococcal isolates were penicillin non-susceptible
 <cit> . the majority of these were of serotype 6b and also exhibited resistance to co-trimoxazole, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and macrolides
 <cit> . genotyping demonstrated that the pneumococci sharing these characteristics were a clonal outbreak closely related to isolates found in spain in the late 1980s, defined as the spain6b- <dig> or pmen <dig> lineage
 <cit> , suggesting a transmission from western europe
 <cit> .

consequently, an effort was initiated to reduce consumption of antibiotics
 <cit>  that achieved a 35% fall in dispensing to icelandic children between  <dig> and 1997
 <cit> . the prevalence of pmen <dig> fell over subsequent years but despite these alterations in clinical practice and the presence of other mdr genotypes
 <cit> , serotype 6b pneumococci still constituted around 3% of icelandic penicillin non-susceptible clinical isolates in 2010
 <cit> . the genotype was found to be variably prevalent in different communities, disappearing from some but persisting in others in a manner that was suggested to relate to local antibiotic prescribing rates and herd immunity
 <cit> . furthermore, some pmen <dig> representatives with losses of particular resistances were identified, which may have been a sign of adaptation to reduced antibiotic consumption
 <cit> . in the case of tetracycline and macrolides, reversions to susceptibility appeared to have occurred through more than one type of mutation, as they were associated with both the presence and absence of the associated resistance gene.

as well as being found throughout western europe from the 1980s onwards
 <cit> , the pmen <dig> lineage has also been detected in the united states
 <cit> , south america
 <cit> , the middle east
 <cit> , south-east asia
 <cit> , australia
 <cit>  and japan
 <cit> . multilocus sequence typing  generally finds such isolates to be of, or similar to, sequence type   <dig>  this suggests it is closely related to the pmen <dig> lineage, first identified in countries around the mediterranean
 <cit>  and subsequently found in western europe and the united states
 <cit> . the pmen <dig> genotype is associated with st <dig>  which differs from st <dig> at only two of the seven mlst loci, and generally has a similar resistance profile to pmen <dig> with the exception that representatives are typically β-lactam susceptible. an international collection of  <dig> isolates was, therefore, assembled to identify the relationship between these two lineages and trace the emergence and spread of the pmen <dig> clone. this included  <dig> isolates from iceland to reconstruct the outbreak on this island in detail, and thereby characterise its initial success and subsequent population dynamics in response to altered antibiotic dispensing practices.

RESULTS
multiple resistance elements across a diverse collection
a total of  <dig> isolates from twelve countries that spanned the period from  <dig> to  <dig> were sequenced as multiplexed libraries using the illumina platform [see additional file
1: table s1]. reads were mapped against the reference genome of s. pneumoniae 670-6b and bases called using previously-defined criteria
 <cit> , leading to the identification of  <dig>  polymorphic sites. reconstructing the evolutionary history of the lineage as described previously
 <cit>  suggested that  <dig>  base substitutions, primarily the result of  <dig> recombinations, had occurred during the divergence of the isolates in the collection . analysis with an alternative algorithm for detecting recombination produced similar results [see additional file
2: figure s1]. the reconstruction involved  <dig>  point mutations, giving an estimate of the overall per site r/m  of  <dig> ; this compares with a typical range from around  <dig>  to more than  <dig> for common pneumococcal lineages
 <cit> . however, it is clear that many of these events occurred within putative mobile genetic elements  and were, therefore, unlikely to be the products of genetic transformation, but rather seemed to primarily represent the consequences of phage movement. excluding the  <dig> recombinations within mges reduced the r/m due to homologous recombination to  <dig> . this subset of recombinations had a mean length of  <dig>  kb and followed an approximately exponential length distribution [see additional file
3: figure s2]
 <cit> , with each event importing a mean of  <dig> base substitutions. the import of sequence via transformation appears to have happened most frequently at the penicillin-binding protein genes pbp2x  and pbp2b, which are important in determining resistance to β-lactams, as well as around the pspc gene, which encodes the pneumococcal surface protein c antigen
 <cit> . no putative recombinations were found to affect the cps locus, the gene cluster that determines an isolate’s serotype. however, this did not preclude a switch from serotype 6b to 6a occurring in isolate 1014– <dig> through the a584g base substitution in wcip causing an n195s amino acid change in the corresponding rhamnosyl transferase enzyme, a polymorphism previously associated with determining which of these two polysaccharide types an isolate produces
 <cit> . only one other base substitution, a non-synonymous change within the regulatory gene wze, occurred within the cps locus on the same branch of the phylogeny, suggesting this alteration could have occurred either through recombinations importing limited diversity or through point mutations.

the resultant phylogeny robustly separated the pmen <dig> and pmen <dig> clones from a third, distinct clade [see additional file
4: figure s3]. all three groups showed evidence of having acquired tn5253-type integrative and conjugative elements . these are large composite elements in which a tn916-type element harbouring the tetracycline resistance gene tetm is inserted into a larger tn5252-type element
 <cit> . the oldest and most diverse clade, labeled ‘outgroup’ in figure 
 <dig>  was composed of isolates that were universally β-lactam sensitive. the ice within this outgroup clade could be represented by four archetypes, which exhibited similarity in gene content but a large degree of structural variation, such as inversion of tn916-type components, differences in the length of the tn5252-type element and variation in the presence of different macrolide resistance cassettes within the tn916-type element 
 <cit> . this made it difficult to deduce whether these represent the entry of a single element that has been maintained  across the clade, or multiple acquisitions of related ice.

a second clade corresponded to the pmen <dig> lineage . this clade had a relatively high r/m:  <dig>  overall and  <dig>  excluding recombinations within mges. these isolates all inherited the insertion of a single, novel large tn5253-type ice, consequently named icesp6bst <dig> . macrolide resistance across the clade was mainly the result of a tn <dig> cassette
 <cit>  within the ice carrying a ribosomal rna methylase gene . chloramphenicol resistance was the result of a cat chloramphenicol acetyltransferase within a pc194-type sequence
 <cit>  as part of a gene cluster very similar to the Ωcat element found within tn <dig> <cit>  [see additional file
6: figure s5]. de novo assemblies indicated this sequence could transpose to different loci within the genome, sometimes integrated into the ice or pneumococcal pathogenicity island- <dig>  as was observed for the archetypal element
 <cit> . this represents a further example of sequence exchange between ice and this island
 <cit> . the pmen <dig> clade was generally β-lactam sensitive, except for a single resistant isolate  that was predicted to have imported  <dig> segments of sequence, totaling just under 254 kb in length, that affected the penicillin binding protein genes pbp1a, pbp2x and pbp2b, but not pbp2a or murmn.

diversification and dissemination of pmen2
β-lactam resistance was independently acquired by the largest clade, corresponding to pmen <dig>  all isolates of which were distinguished from the outgroup and pmen <dig> clades by  <dig> shared segments of recombinant sequence that totaled 156 kb in length. this resulted in the import of resistance-associated alleles of pbp1a, pbp2x and pbp2b <cit> , but no contemporaneous recombinations affecting pbp2a or murmn were detected. resistance to tetracycline and chloramphenicol resulted from the acquisition of icesp6bst <dig> on the same branch of the phylogeny, which was shared by all pmen <dig> representatives through common descent [see additional file
6: figure s5]; this contained both a tn916-type element and a Ωcat-like element
 <cit>  [see additional file
7: figure s6]. therefore, the antibiotic resistance determinants of pmen <dig> and pmen <dig> appear to have been entirely independently acquired. many isolates were also resistant to macrolides owing to the acquisition of the ermb gene carried on either the omega cassette
 <cit>  or tn <dig>  both of which appear to have been acquired more than once during the evolution of pmen <dig> [see additional file
5: figure s4]. based on one atypical tn916-type sequence [see additional file
8: figure s7], it seems likely that both cassettes were acquired by a recent common ancestor of one particular clade of three isolates, thereby arranging two highly similar ermb genes in tandem. a subsequent intragenomic recombination between them appears to have deleted the intervening sequence, resulting in a reversion to tetracycline susceptibility owing to the loss of the tetm gene, but leaving the aminoglycoside resistance gene aph3’ and ermb in its place.

a plot of the root-to-tip distance of the isolates within the pmen <dig> clade relative to their date of isolation revealed a significant linear correlation  that suggested a date of origin around  <dig> [see additional file
9: figure s8a]. a bayesian coalescent analysis of the clade estimated the most likely date of origin to be  <dig> , implying a point mutation rate of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> substitutions per site per year . this origin is likely to have occurred in western europe , in accordance with the site of the first identification of the clone
 <cit> . pmen <dig> then seems to have spread to other continents on multiple occasions, concurrent with isolates undergoing extensive diversification across much of the genome.

clonal evolution within iceland
by contrast, the icelandic isolates formed two clades , neither of which exhibited strong evidence of having engaged in homologous recombination . clade ic <dig> appears to represent a relatively unsuccessful transmission to the island; all six representatives were macrolide sensitive, as they carried versions of icesp6bst <dig> lacking an ermb-containing cassette. the most recent common ancestor of ic <dig> was estimated to have existed around  <dig>  shortly before the first clinical isolate was detected, but no isolates belonging to the clade were detected from  <dig> onwards. the ic <dig> isolates corresponded to three similar pulsed field gel electrophoresis  patterns
 <cit> ; although no putative homologous recombinations were identified within this group that might have caused such diversification, there were five recombination events within mges indicating that the acquisition of autonomously mobile elements may have caused the alterations. the larger ic <dig> clade was composed of  <dig> isolates and appears to have entered iceland at a similar time, around  <dig> . these isolates were generally macrolide resistant due to the insertion of tn <dig> into icesp6bst <dig> .

only  <dig> recombinations were detected within clade ic <dig>  of which  <dig> occurred within prophage and appear to represent the movement of viral sequences. each of the remaining six events imported no more than eight substitutions, far below the mean of  <dig> substitutions per recombination in the wider collection. consequently, all of the isolates tested near the start of the outbreak corresponded to a single pfge type
 <cit> , and the clade’s r/m was  <dig> , falling to  <dig>  when recombinations within mges were excluded. this seems largely due to the insertion of a prophage, henceforth referred to as Φic <dig>  into the comyc  gene, which encodes a component of the competence pilus essential for the uptake of exogenous dna into the cell
 <cit> . the integration of prophage into this locus has previously been experimentally associated with the loss of competence for transformation
 <cit> . sequence read mapping to Φic <dig> revealed that related viruses with very similar integrases, which seem to target the same locus based on cases where the prophage could be assembled de novo, appear to have inserted into pmen <dig> representatives across the world on several occasions [see additional file
10: figure s <dig> and additional file
11: figure s10]. this analysis of prophage distribution also showed that the Φic <dig> virus is absent from the chromosomes of many isolates within clade ic <dig>  indicative of frequent loss. based on de novo assemblies, the comyc gene seems to have returned to a functional form in these samples, demonstrating that the mge’s excision is precise. however, loss of the prophage was not associated with a detectably elevated rate of sequence import, as only one of the putative homologous recombination events was associated with isolates carrying ‘repaired’ comyc genes.

phylodynamics of the icelandic outbreak
the phylogeny supported the hypothesis that pmen <dig> entered iceland from western europe
 <cit>  , but not the suggestion of spain in particular being the source, which was based on genotyping of isolates sp <dig> and sp <dig> . the isolate most closely related to clade ic <dig> was from germany, albeit from  <dig>  post-dating the estimated dates of clades ic <dig> and ic <dig> arriving in iceland by around a decade. the transmission and population dynamics of clade ic <dig> subsequent to its entry into iceland were reconstructed using a coalescent model to combine the sequence alignment with the detailed epidemiological information available. this analysis could be performed independently of the rest of the collection, as this clade alone showed a significant correlation between root-to-tip distance within the clade and day of isolation . this estimated the date of ic1’s common ancestor as around october  <dig> , consistent with the overall analysis of the pmen <dig> clade.

the change in the clade’s prevalence was estimated using a bayesian skyline plot 
 <cit> . this traces changes in the product of the effective population size  and the generation time ; assuming τ to be constant, the plot can be taken as an estimate of ne over time. this analysis found ne to start at zero when the genotype entered the country, rising to a peak in the mid-1990s, before dropping to a much lower level by  <dig>  comparison with the recorded numbers of penicillin non-susceptible serogroup  <dig> isolates recovered from disease over the same period revealed a similar pattern of rise and fall. there was not a clear relationship with the overall levels of usage of any one particular antibiotic over time, although post- <dig> there was a consistent fall in the usage of penicillins, sulphonamides and macrolides. however, these chart the overall consumption of antibiotics, whereas the reduction in prescribing was targeted at children , in whom consumption fell by 35%
 <cit> . furthermore, it may well be that these overall trends masked more obvious changes at the level of individual communities, as seen by location-specific epidemiological surveillance
 <cit> .
 <cit> .  proportion of clade ic <dig> isolates resistant to tetracycline, erythromycin and chloramphenicol over time. the total number of sequenced isolates from clade ic <dig> is represented by the black line, relative to the right side vertical axis. the proportions of these isolates resistant to selected antibiotics in each year, excluding those for which no phenotype was available or that were defined as having an ‘intermediate’ resistance phenotype [see additional file
1: table s1], are represented by the coloured lines relative to the left side vertical axis.  use of antibiotics in iceland. annual defined daily doses  in iceland for classes of antibiotics against which ic <dig> isolates were found to have resistance are displayed. the data in panels  and  are plotted using the midpoint of each year such that they are displayed on approximately the same timescale as the changes in the effective population size of ic <dig> in panel .

to trace transmission at a more local level, a discrete state phylogeographic model was fitted as part of the coalescent analysis . this analysis indicated reykjavík was an important source of transmissions, being the reconstructed location of more than 90% of the phylogeny’s internal nodes, including the root node. however, this might have been anticipated from the composition of the collection, given that 81% of the ic <dig> isolates were from the capital and surrounding suburbs, which contained around 57% of the total icelandic population at the start of the outbreak
 <cit> . correspondingly, randomly permuting the locations of the isolates  <dig> times found the same, or greater, proportion of internal nodes to be ascribed to reykjavík in  <dig> cases, with every permutation attributing the root node as emanating from the capital. by contrast, the second most common location of reykjanesbær was associated with five internal nodes in the original analysis; a similar pattern was only reconstructed in a single permutation. hence, the phylogeographic analysis provided significant evidence of a series of transmissions across the relatively densely populated southern peninsular of the island, distinct from the network of transmissions involving reykjavík.
 <cit> . the locations are clustered by region in the key.  each isolate’s resistance profile is represented by red bars indicating full resistance, purple bars indicating intermediate levels of resistance and blue bars indicating sensitivity to the antibiotics annotated at the top of the column; white bars indicate missing data.  the isolates are classified according to the phenotypic groups one to six defined in
 <cit>  based on resistance phenotype and genotype, which are described in the main text.

‘disarming’ of an mdr clone
all isolates prior to  <dig> for which definitive phenotypes were available were resistant to tetracycline, macrolides and chloramphenicol [see additional file
1: table s <dig> and figure 
3b]; however, after the reduction in antibiotic dispensing, isolates that appeared to have reverted to a susceptible phenotype were observed. based on isolates’ resistance profile and the presence of the tetm and ermb genes, six groups were identified . group  <dig> isolates had the resistance profile expected from the original genotype, whereas deviations were classed in groups  <dig> to 6
 <cit> . group  <dig> isolates were tetracycline sensitive, despite a dna probe indicating that the tetm gene was present. five examples were evident in this collection, distributed polyphyletically as one clade of three isolates and two singletons. in each case, the alteration in phenotype was associated with the same 58 bp deletion upstream of tetm . normally, tetm transcription is thought to be repressed through an attenuation mechanism: the rapid initiation of translation of a leader peptide results in the formation of a hairpin loop that terminates rna synthesis before the resistance determinant is transcribed
 <cit> . however, in the presence of tetracycline, the translation of the leader peptide is delayed enough that a different set of stem-loops form, resulting in the expression of the tetm coding sequence. therefore, it seems likely that the 58 bp deletion disrupted this mechanism and thereby constitutively inhibited the synthesis of the tetm protein. this mutation was not observed in any non-icelandic isolates.

group  <dig> isolates were again tetracycline sensitive, but differed in also being susceptible to macrolides, having apparently lost both the tetm and ermb genes. this phenotype appears to have emerged twice within clade ic1; in both cases, it was associated with the excision of the tn916-type element. this loss was evident both from comparison of de novo assemblies with the reference, as well as an absence of sequence read mapping to the element . the removal of the ice was precise and led to the restoration of a gene encoding a zinc-dependent peptidase that appeared to have been split by the insertion of the tn916-type component in the formation of the composite ice. aside from the deletion within tn <dig> driven by the tandem ermb genes, this element was stable across the rest of the pmen <dig> clade, as observed in other lineages
 <cit> .

group  <dig> isolates were tetracycline resistant but macrolide sensitive, despite retaining the ermb gene and, by implication, the tn916-type element. this phenotype was found in a single clade of three isolates within ic <dig>  de novo assembly revealed this to be the consequence of 8 bp of the ermb cds being replaced by 7 bp of divergent sequence, introducing a frameshift mutation that truncated the resistance gene. the disruptive 7 bp sequence is an inverted copy of the same pattern of bases found downstream within ermb, suggesting that the change may have been driven by an unusual intragenomic recombination. this mutation only appears to have occurred once across the entire collection.

group  <dig> isolates were defined as those displaying susceptibility to chloramphenicol; however, it was not previously possible to determine whether this was correlated with the loss of the cat chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. analysis of the de novo genome assemblies revealed that the frequent emergence of this phenotype in the collection was, once more, associated with isolates both possessing, and having lost, the ice-encoded gene. one clade of isolates had a  <dig>  kb deletion within the tn5252-type component of the ice that eliminated part of the Ωcat-like element, including the cat gene; this appears to have resulted from an intragenomic recombination between the long tandemly-repeated sequences on either side . this unstable element also appears to have been lost outside of iceland on several occasions [see additional file
6: figure s5]. however, no obvious candidate mutations causing chloramphenicol susceptibility could be found affecting the Ωcat-like element in other group  <dig> representatives, although ambiguities in establishing the element’s mobility and insertion site made it difficult to fully characterize in all isolates. group  <dig> isolates, susceptible to chloramphenicol, tetracycline and macrolides despite retaining the required genes, similarly lacked any obvious mutation underlying their resistance profile.

discussion
the pmen <dig> lineage appears to have emerged in the late 1960s, around the same time as pmen <dig> , when β-lactam non-susceptible pneumococci were first being detected
 <cit> . therefore, pmen <dig> is likely to have been one of the first such genotypes. both pmen <dig> and pmen <dig> seem to have acquired near-identical penicillin-binding protein sequences, and both acquired cat from pc <dig>  and tetm from tn <dig>  as part of a tn5253-type element
 <cit> . while pmen <dig> was more successful in many countries, it was pmen <dig> that predominated in iceland, despite the presence of other mdr clones 
 <cit> . more specifically, clade ic <dig> of pmen <dig> appears to have been much more successful than ic <dig>  which may reflect the macrolide resistance cassette carried by clade ic <dig>  this is supported by the observation that treatment with erythromycin was associated with double the risk of carrying penicillin resistant pneumococci as treatment with β-lactams in iceland at the time
 <cit> .

the fall in dispensing of antibiotics to children that started in  <dig> is likely to have reduced the selection pressure driving pmen2’s success within iceland
 <cit> . in the mid-1990s, this seems to be reflected in the instances of the mdr clone being ‘disarmed’. each of the reversions to chloramphenicol, tetracycline and macrolide sensitivity occurred both in the presence and absence of the relevant resistance gene; furthermore, some of the specific mutations were homoplasic within clade ic <dig>  such convergent evolution is likely driven by selection; this would suggest that these resistance mechanisms impose a fitness cost upon the host cell and, therefore, tend to degrade as they became less advantageous
 <cit> . however, these variants appear only to have enjoyed limited success, and primarily seem to have been observed when the pmen <dig> clone was present at a comparatively high frequency relative to the use of antibiotics in children selecting for resistance. both the count of clinical isolates and apparent change in neτ indicate a drop in the prevalence of clade ic <dig> beginning in the mid- to late-1990s. once the clone fell to a lower, stable frequency in response to this change in prescribing, the pressure to revert to a sensitive phenotype is likely to have been reduced. this may explain why no further reversions to macrolide resistance were observed from  <dig> onwards. alternatively, the limited success of these variants may indicate that such mutations are only adaptive over the short-term to atypically low antibiotic use in a certain community
 <cit> .

by contrast, non-ice ‘core’ sequences that caused antibiotic resistance were stable within clade ic <dig>  for instance, resistance to penicillins and co-trimoxazole was retained despite the declining use of these drugs. this is inevitable in the context of the clonal evolution of clade ic1; in the absence of allelic replacement at dyr , folp  or penicillin-binding protein genes, reversion to the sensitive ancestral sequences was not possible. this is similar to the pattern of evolution observed in serotype  <dig> isolates
 <cit>  and in contrast to the rapid import of divergent sequence observed in pmen1
 <cit>  and pmen <dig> isolates from outside iceland in this collection. this absence of transformation largely appears to be the consequence of the disruption of comyc by the insertion of prophage Φic <dig>  although it is not clear why the isolates lacking this element still do not import sequence diversity from other pneumococci. it may be that the prophage is unstable only during disease or laboratory culturing, and that, in fact, the prophage remained inserted in all carried ic <dig> isolates. this failure to adapt to changing levels of antibiotic use in children through horizontal import of sequence may have played a part in the subsequent decline of clade ic <dig> in iceland after the mid-1990s.

alternatively, the lack of antigenic diversification resulting from the absence of recombination may have contributed to the genotype’s fall in prevalence. the high density of recombination events affecting the pspc locus outside of the ic <dig> clade suggests a selective pressure to alter such antigen-encoding genes. therefore, the decrease in clade ic1’s frequency may be the consequence of the resident population accumulating herd immunity to the genotype
 <cit> ; this may be particularly acute in iceland, as the phylogeography of the lineage suggests that only reykjavík and the southern peninsular region sustained the genotype long-term, potentially acting as a source for the rest of the country. declining transmission within these communities may have resulted in an ensuing fall in the rate of spread of the clade to other locations. furthermore, as the acquisition of a capsule differing extensively from 6b seems unlikely within clade ic <dig>  it seems destined for elimination following the introduction of polysaccharide conjugate vaccines  in 2011
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
pmen <dig> emerged in the 1960s, and a single transmission into iceland in the late 1980s appears to have been particularly successful despite its lack of sequence import through homologous recombination. while this limitation did not appear to inhibit the loss of antibiotic resistance found on mobile genetic elements, it prevented modification of ‘core’ sequences associated with resistance and antigenic diversification, which likely contributed to its decline after the mid-1990s.
