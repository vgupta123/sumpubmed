BACKGROUND
photoreceptors are the highly specialized sensory receptors of the retina and express a unique array of genes that enable them to convert light energy into a neural signal. many of these genes, including those encoding components of the phototransduction cascade  and those involved in retinoid recycling , are expressed only in photoreceptor cells in the retina and in a subset of cells in the pineal gland  <cit> . in addition, these genes have highly stereotyped temporal and spatial patterns of expression during retinal development  <cit>  that are transcriptionally regulated  <cit> . we are interested in understanding the transcriptional networks that regulate photoreceptor-specific gene expression, not only as a model for cell-specific gene regulation, but to gain insight into the mechanisms that regulate photoreceptor differentiation and neuro-degenerative retinal disease.

the proximal promoter regions of both rho   <cit>  and irbp   <cit>  are sufficient to drive photoreceptor-specific expression of reporter genes in transgenic mice. using dnase i protection assays, binding sites for both retina-enriched and more widely expressed proteins have been identified on these promoters  <cit>  and include both positive and negative regulatory elements  <cit> . among the positive regulatory elements, ret- <dig>  bat- <dig> and pce- <dig> each contain a core atta sequence that can be bound by homeodomain containing transcription factors including crx  <cit> , rx/rax  <cit> , erx  <cit> , qrx  <cit>  and otx <dig>  <cit> . binding sites for the basic-leucine zipper transcription factor nrl have been identified in the promoters of rhodopsin  <cit>  as well as other photoreceptor-specific genes including arrestin  <cit>  and the rod-specific α- and β-pde  <cit> . combinatorial effects by crx and nrl result in synergistic increases in rho promoter activation in vitro that likely contribute to the high levels of expression in rod photoreceptors in vivo  <cit>  both crx and nrl play key roles in photoreceptor development and survival: in crx knock-out mice, rod photoreceptors fail to elaborate outer segments and degenerate and the mice lack detectible visual function  <cit> ; in nrl knock-out mice, rod photoreceptors apparently fail to differentiate  and mice have severely reduced visual function  <cit> . in addition, mutations in both crx and nrl have been identified in patients with a variety of inherited retinal degenerative diseases including autosomal dominant and recessive retinitis pigmentosa, leber congenital amaurosis and cone-rod dystrophy  <cit> .

although transcriptional repression plays an important role in development and cell fate determination in the central nervous system and inappropriate de-repression of gene expression can contribute to disease  <cit> , relatively little is known about negative regulation of photoreceptor-specific gene expression. negative regulatory elements, including the crs- <dig> site in the rhodopsin promoter  <cit>  and the g-rich repressor in the irbp promoter  <cit>  are bound by nuclear proteins present in both retinal and non-retinal tissues, although the identities of the specific transcription factors have not been established. the zinc-finger transcription factor mok <dig> binds to sites in the promoter and intron  <dig> of irbp and represses transactivation of reporter constructs containing these elements in vitro  <cit> . other proteins interact with crx  or nrl  and can reduce their ability to activate transcription, but these appear to repress via protein/protein interactions rather than binding directly to the promoter. we recently identified klf <dig>  a member of the sp/klf family of zinc-finger containing transcription factors, as a repressor of both the rhodopsin and irbp promoters in vitro  <cit> .

klf <dig> is expressed in both retinal and non-retinal tissues and, like other members of the sp/klf family, is characterized by the presence of three krüppel-type zinc-finger domains at the c-terminus  <cit> . members of this gene family have been characterized as regulators of both tissue-specific and ubiquitous genes and can function as either transcriptional activators, repressors or both depending on promoter context  <cit>  klf <dig> appears to be bi-functional, as it represses the rho and irbp promoters  <cit>  and the kidney-specific clc-k <dig> and clc-k <dig> promoters  <cit>  but activates the glut <dig>  promoter  <cit> . klf1/eklf  <cit> , klf <dig>  <cit>  and klf <dig>  <cit>  all bind a core caccc site in vitro, although this is shorter than the  <dig> bp site predicted for a three zinc-finger containing protein and is likely to provide only limited specificity. to gain further insight into the mechanism of klf15-mediated regulation of gene expression, we have characterized the binding characteristics and specificity of klf <dig> and defined the klf <dig> binding sites in the rho and irbp promoters.

RESULTS
emsa analysis of klf <dig> binding
dna binding properties of klf <dig> were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays  using gst-tagged, human klf <dig> fusion protein. constructs for the full-length klf <dig> fusion protein expressed poorly in bacterial cells and yielded a highly degraded protein. therefore, a recombinant fusion protein  containing the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids including the three c-terminal zinc-finger domains fused to gst was expressed and purified from bacteria. western blot of crude bacterial lysates using anti-gst antibodies showed minor degradation of the fusion protein prior to purification; however, the majority of the protein recovered following affinity purification consisted of intact klf15-zf fusion protein .

comparison of the proximal promoter regions showed that the  <dig> bp fragment of the bovine rho promoter  used as bait in the yeast one-hybrid assay that identified klf <dig>  <cit>  shared high sequence identity with the equivalent element from the human rhodopsin promoter , differing by only  <dig> bp. in emsa, klf15-zf fusion protein shifted oligomers for both brho <dig>  and hrho <dig>  and these could be supershifted by addition of antibodies against klf <dig>   or gst . the lower molecular weight band that was supershifted by the anti-klf <dig> but not by anti-gst antibodies most likely resulted from low levels of protein that had lost the n-terminal, gst-tag, but retained the c-terminus of the protein containing the dna binding domain and the anti-klf <dig> antibody recognition site.

zinc dependence of klf <dig> binding
the secondary structure of zinc-finger domains and as well as their ability to bind dna is dependent on the chelation of zn+ <dig> ions by cys2-his <dig> residues within each zinc finger  <cit> . to determine if dna binding by klf15-zf was in fact zn+ <dig> dependent, aliquots of the fusion protein were diluted in edta to chelate divalent cations and subsequently added to binding reactions containing 32p-labeled brho <dig> or hrho <dig> oligonucleotides. increasing concentrations of edta resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in klf15-zf binding to brho <dig>  or to hrho <dig> , with binding completely eliminated when protein was prepared in  <dig> mm edta, resulting in  <dig> mm edta in the final binding reaction. dna binding was reconstituted by addition of  <dig> mm zncl <dig>  or znacetate , but not mgcl <dig>  to the binding reactions. as an additional test of cation specificity, we tested klf <dig> binding activity in the presence of egta, a chelator that preferentially binds ca+ <dig>  no loss of klf15-zf binding was observed in the presence of up to  <dig> mm egta . it is interesting to note that the retina and other ocular tissues contain unusually high levels of zinc compared to other tissues and zinc deficiency has been implicated with various retinopathies including macular degeneration, night blindness and retinitis pigmentosa  <cit> . chelation of intracellular zinc can modulate conformation and dna binding activity of the zinc-finger transcription factor p <dig> in cultured cells  <cit> ; therefore, physiological zinc deficiencies could result in loss of dna binding activity of zinc-finger proteins in vivo.

sequence specificity of klf <dig> binding
sequence specificity of klf15-zf binding was examined by emsa using a series of unlabeled oligomers as competitors . the addition of 250-fold excess of cold brho <dig> or hrho <dig> effectively competed with the radiolabeled brho <dig> probe for klf <dig> binding. we also tested oligomers irbp <dig> and irbp <dig> that contained binding sites for the zinc-finger transcription factor mok <dig> and are located in the promoter and intron  <dig> of irbp respectively  <cit> . neither of these heterologous oligomers competed with radiolabeled brho <dig>  or hrho <dig> probes .

to identify the specific bases within brho <dig> and hrho <dig> that were critical for binding, we generated a series of scanning oligomers, each containing a triplet of mutated bases . because an individual zinc-finger domain typically binds to a dna triplet, this approach was selected to maximize the likelihood that the mutations would disrupt protein/dna interactions. oligomers with  <dig> or more mutated bases within the central c-rich sequence  had reduced ability to compete with the wild-type brho <dig>  or hrho <dig> , whereas oligomers with mutations of any other triplet competed as well as wild-type.

to test if there was binding activity in retinal proteins that was specific to the klf <dig> binding site, we performed emsa using a total retinal extract with either the wild-type brho <dig> oligo or the Δ <dig> oligo  containing a mutated klf <dig> binding site . with both the wild-type and mutant oligos, there were multiple shifted bands observed, however mutation of the klf <dig> binding site eliminated several of the major bands. bands that were unique to the wild-type oligo were not abolished by the addition of up to 200-fold excess of the Δ <dig> oligo as a competitor, while those that were common to both were reduced in intensity to near background levels. this is consistent with our findings that Δ <dig> was unable to compete with the wild-type brho <dig> for binding to the klf15-zf fusion protein in competitive emsa . we observed that with the wild-type oligo, those bands that were dependent on the presence of an intact klf <dig> binding site showed the greatest intensity; in contrast, when the klf <dig> binding site was mutated, those bands that were not dependent on the presence of the klf <dig> binding site were increased in intensity.

klf <dig> binding sites in rhodopsin and irbp promoters
dnase i footprinting was used to identify klf <dig> binding sites in the bovine rho and irbp promoters. using two overlapping fragments of the bovine rppr  as templates, klf15-zf protected six distinct sites  that were generally similar in their boundaries on both the forward and reverse strands . in the irbp proximal promoter, klf <dig> protected three sites  on both forward and reverse strands . examination of the sequences protected by klf15-zf showed that all contained extended c-rich or g-rich sequences , consistent with the site identified by competitive emsa. to identify a consensus binding site, we analyzed the sequences of the c-rich strands of the nine klf <dig> protected regions using target explorer software  <cit> . assuming a 60% at, 40% gc content in the genome and a  <dig> bp binding site, we identified the top  <dig> matrices . all of the matrices included the site identified by competitive emsa and, when used to evaluate the oligos tested in competitive emsa, could discriminate between the strong competitors and weak/non-competitors.

matrix  <dig> yielded the greatest difference between the scores of competitors and non-competitors . possible scores ranged from - <dig>  to  <dig> , with the scores for the klf <dig> protected sites ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . oligos that were good competitors in emsa all contained at least one binding site with a score >  <dig> , whereas those that were poor competitors had maximal scores <  <dig> . using 1/ <dig> of the difference between these scores as a cutoff , we analyzed the proximal promoters of rhodopsin  and irbp  from human, chimp, dog, mouse and rat to identify potential klf <dig> binding sites . these analyses showed that the kr-a site was conserved across all mammalian rhodopsin promoters analyzed, and the kr-d site was present in all but the dog promoter, which contained an additional klf <dig> binding site immediately 5' to kr-e. the other four klf <dig> binding sites were conserved only in non-rodents, although one novel binding site located 3' to site kr-d was predicted in the mouse and rat promoters. in the irbp promoters, ki-b and ki-c were conserved in bovine, human, chimp and dog, with an additional site predicted in the mouse promoter  and in bovine and dog .

effects of klf <dig> on a minimal bovine rhodopsin promoter
we previously reported that klf <dig> repressed transactivation of brho225-luc, a promoter-luciferase reporter construct containing - <dig> to + <dig> bp of the bovine rhodopsin promoter  <cit>  that contained the six klf <dig> binding sites identified in dnase i footprinting analysis. a smaller fragment of the rhodopsin proximal promoter  containing only four klf <dig> binding sites, but lacking the kr-e/crs- <dig> and kr-f sites, is still sufficient to drive expression of a reporter gene in primary cultures retinal cells from chick  <cit> . using a luciferase reporter construct containing this smaller fragment of the rhodopsin promoter , the results of transient transfections of  <dig> cells were qualitatively similar to those previously reported using the brho225-luc construct: klf <dig> alone or in co-transfections with crx and/or nrl resulted in statistically significant decreases in luciferase expression . in co-transfections with crx, high concentrations of klf <dig> were more effective at reducing luciferase expression ; in contrast, there was a relatively concentration-independent reduction  in luciferase expression in co-transfections with nrl at all concentrations of klf <dig> tested . we compared the results of promoter transactivation assays using brho130-luc with those previously obtained using brho225-luc  <cit>  and found that luciferase expression in transfections with klf <dig> was consistently lower with brho225-luc than with brho130-luc, with the differences within the 95% confidence interval for kfl15+crx  and within 90% confidence interval for klf <dig> alone , klf15+nrl  and klf15+crx+nrl .

discussion
we previously identified klf <dig> as a transcriptional repressor of the rhodopsin and irbp promoters in vitro and report here the characterization of klf15's dna binding properties. for these analyses, we analyzed protein binding specificity on bovine promoters using a truncated human klf15-gst fusion protein containing the c-terminal dna binding domain, but lacking the n-terminal repressor domain  <cit> . since zinc-finger domains typically function as modular dna binding motifs that can bind their target sequences independently of other protein domains  <cit> , the binding specificity of the truncated klf <dig> fusion protein is predicted to be similar, if not identical, to the full length protein. previous studies showed that recombinant gst fusion proteins containing the full length human or rat klf <dig> bound to an element in the clc-k <dig> promoter  <cit>  and we found that our truncated klf <dig> fusion protein also bound the same element in emsa . the amino acid sequence of the zinc finger domains of bovine klf <dig> differs from human, chimp, dog, mouse and rat at only a single amino acid residue  and the flanking regions that were included in the klf15-zf fusion protein differ at only  <dig> amino acid residues between human and bovine klf <dig>  we would predict, therefore, that the dna binding specificity would show only minor differences  between these species. supporting this prediction, the human klf15-gst fusion protein shifted oligos containing either the bovine or human klf <dig> consensus site. using emsa, we have confirmed that proteins present in retinal extracts can bind specifically to the klf <dig> binding site. however, this result does not necessarily mean that the observed binding activity is attributable to klf <dig>  other members of the klf family recognize similar g/c rich binding motifs  <cit>  and maz  can also recognize the klf <dig> core binding site  <cit> . thus, it remains a distinct possibility that, in addition to klf <dig>  there are other retinal proteins that can recognize this site.

several of the klf <dig> binding sites that we identified in dnase i footprinting correspond to previously identified promoter elements. in emsa, both retina-specific and ubiquitous nuclear proteins bind a  <dig> bp probe  containing the ret- <dig> element  in the rhodopsin promoter  <cit> . interestingly, mutations in the g-rich sequence within the ret- <dig> element that would be predicted to disrupt the klf <dig> binding site eliminated binding by the ubiquitously expressed proteins  <cit> . in dnase i footprinting assays of the bovine rhodopsin proximal promoter, nuclear extracts from bovine retina  <cit>  and from y <dig> and weri retinoblastoma cells  <cit>  protected the bat- <dig>  site. two additional sites protected by bovine retinal proteins are ret- <dig>  and crs- <dig>   <cit> . three of these sites correspond to sites protected by klf <dig> in our dnase i footprinting, kr-6/ret- <dig>  kr-c/bat- <dig> and kr-e/crs- <dig>  in addition to being protected by nuclear proteins from retinal extract, the crs- <dig> site is protected by proteins present in nuclear extracts from non-retinal tissues  <cit> . klf <dig> is expressed in the multiple tissues including the retina  <cit>  and can repress rhodopsin promoter constructs in transient transfections  <cit> . although we do not yet know the relative importance of these different klf <dig> binding sites in regulation of target gene expression in vivo, our in vitro assays showed that klf <dig> more effectively repressed a rhodopsin promoter construct  containing six klf <dig> binding sites  than a shorter promoter construct  that contains only  <dig> , suggesting that both the proximal and distal sites influence klf15's repressor activity.

the g-rich repressor element is located between - <dig> and - <dig> bp in irbp promoter and overlaps the ki-c binding site for klf <dig>  deletion of the g-rich element increases reporter gene expression in retinoblastoma cells  <cit>  and results in inappropriate expression of gfp reporter constructs in non-retinal tissues in xenopus laevis  <cit> . in dnase i footprinting, this site is protected by proteins present in nuclear extracts from both retinoblastoma weri-rb <dig> and non-retinal hela cells  <cit> . based on the ability of oligos containing the sp <dig> consensus site to compete with the g-rich element in emsa, it was proposed that sp <dig> or sp1-related proteins bind this site in vivo  <cit> . klf <dig> represses transactivation of an irbp promoter construct in vitro, is expressed in both retinal and non-retinal tissues, and is structurally and phylogenetically related to the sp family of transcription factors  <cit> , making it an attractive candidate to bind the g-rich repressor element in vivo.

potential klf <dig> binding sites corresponding to the crs- <dig> and g-rich sites are present in the bovine, human, chimp and dog promoters. it was, however, somewhat surprising that no consensus klf <dig> binding sites were identified at corresponding locations in the mouse or rat promoters. as the zinc-finger domains are identical between these species, it seems unlikely that the lack of identifiable binding sites at these locations reflects species-specific differences in klf15's binding specificity. although we cannot formally exclude this possibility, there are several possible alternative interpretations of this observation. the simplest explanation is that the location or number of klf <dig> binding sites differs between species, possibly reflecting the accumulation of mutations during evolution. a comparison of well characterized promoters of  <dig> genes found substantial differences between human and mouse, with 32–40% of the binding sites identified in the human promoters containing sufficient sequence changes in the mouse promoters to render them non-functional  <cit> . in addition, despite our evidence showing that klf <dig> binds the crs- <dig> and g-rich repressor elements in vitro, there may be species-specific differences in the identity and/or sequence specificity of the transcription factor that bind this site in vivo.

changes in transcriptional regulation are thought to play a significant role in generating phenotypic differences between species  <cit>  and there are clearly morphological and developmental differences between cows, primates, dogs and rodents. in the retina, differences include the time course of embryonic/fetal development and cellular differentiation, as well as the proportions and absolute numbers of different neuronal subtypes  present in the mature retina. along with these morphological differences, there are species-specific variations in the regulation of photoreceptor-specific gene expression. in the bovine retina, transcripts for rhodopsin, irbp, arrestin, rod α-transducin and rod α-pde all begin to accumulate relatively late in retinal development, at the time when the first outer segments are detected  <cit> . in contrast, in mice and rats there is considerable variation in the developmental stage when different photoreceptor-specific genes are first expressed  <cit> . interestingly, the crs-1/kr-e site was initially proposed to play a role in repressing premature rhodopsin expression during retinal development, based on the observation that protection of the crs- <dig> site by fetal bovine retinal proteins diminishes throughout development  <cit>  in a temporal pattern that is coordinated with increases in rhodopsin transcription and mrna accumulation  <cit> . further emphasizing the extent of the differences between species, a large scale analysis of expressed genes in the mouse retina found that out of nearly  <dig> known genes that could be assigned map locations in the mouse genome, 25% had no identifiable human ortholog  <cit> . although the identification and characterization of conserved genes and regulatory mechanisms has provided significant contributions to our understanding of retinal development and disease, there are likely to be novel and potentially valuable insights that can be obtained through comparative analysis of the basis of species-specific differences.

several klf proteins have been shown to bind a core caccc element  <cit>  and gray and colleagues  <cit>  demonstrated that 5'-caccc-3' is sufficient for klf <dig> binding in emsa. a single zinc finger typically makes contact with  <dig> adjacent bases  <cit>  therefore the three zinc-fingers of klf <dig> would be predicted to have a  <dig> bp binding site, consistent with our emsa results. we found that mutations outside of the  <dig> bp consensus site had no effect on dna binding in emsa; however, when we used targetexplorer to re-analyze the klf <dig> protected sequences identified in dnase i footprinting, making no a priori assumptions as to the actual size of the consensus binding site, a longer 12– <dig> bp consensus sequence was identified. the functional significance of the extended consensus site is unclear, but it is interesting to note that the kr-b, kr-c and kr-d sites respectively overlapped the ret- <dig>  bat- <dig> and ret- <dig> sites, all containing known binding sites for homeodomain containing proteins including crx  <cit> . the kr-b site is located at the 3' end of the ret- <dig> site within a g-rich sequence is a binding site for nuclear proteins present in both retinal and non-retinal tissues  <cit> . the highly conserved kr-d site is within a gc-rich sequence that functions to facilitate binding of retinal nuclear proteins to the adjacent ret- <dig> site  <cit> . one interpretation is that klf <dig> binding sites are preferentially located adjacent to binding sites for other transcription factors, possibly crx or other otx-related factors. in emsa using total retinal proteins, mutation of the klf <dig> binding site increased binding of some retinal proteins to the Δ <dig> oligo, as shown by the increased intensity of klf15-independent bands . as mutation of the klf <dig> binding site does not alter the core homeodomain binding site present in these oligos, homeodomain proteins  present in retinal extracts likely bind to both the wild-type and mutant oligos. although mutation of the klf <dig> site may have inadvertently created a novel protein binding site, several of the bands showing increased intensity with the Δ <dig> oligo were also present using the wild-type brho <dig> oligo, raising the possibility that occupancy of the klf <dig> site can affect protein/dna interactions of other dna binding proteins. the proximity of klf <dig> and crx binding sites and our findings that  klf <dig> can repress transactivation of the rhodopsin promoter by crx in vitro and  both kfl <dig> and crx are expressed in non-photoreceptor cells in the inner nuclear layer  <cit>  are consistent with a possible in vivo role for klf <dig> in repressing inappropriate activation of the rhodopsin promoter by crx in non-photoreceptor cells.

a similar correlation between klf <dig> and crx binding sites was not observed in the irbp promoter. however, the ki-c site/g-rich repressor element in the bovine irbp promoter is adjacent to a cpg dinucleotide  that becomes hypomethylated specifically in retinal cells at the time irbp expression is first detected  <cit> . the g-rich repressor element is bound by proteins present in non-retinal tissues where the cpg dinucleotide remains methylated; therefore, it is tempting to speculate that klf <dig> may participate in regulating methylation at this site. other klf genes are known to regulate chromatin remodeling. the transcriptional activator klf1/eklf recruits a swi/snf-related chromatin remodeling complex that is thought to be involved in regulation of the locus control region of the β-globin gene  <cit> . the transcriptional repressor klf14/bteb <dig> interacts with a co-repressor  and the histone deacetylase protein hdac- <dig> though repressor domains within the n-terminus to mediate transcriptional repression through chromatin remodeling  <cit> . interestingly, in our footprinting analysis of the rhodopsin promoter we observed several sites of increased dnase i hypersensitivity adjacent to klf <dig> protected regions, possibly reflecting alterations in dna configuration and potentially lending additional support for involvement of klf <dig> in chromatin remodeling.

CONCLUSIONS
the goal of these studies was to determine the binding characteristics and specificity of klf <dig> and define the klf <dig> binding sites in the rho and irbp promoters in order to gain further insight into the mechanism of klf15-mediated regulation of retinal gene expression. we found that klf <dig> binds to multiple  <dig> bp consensus sites in the rhodopsin and irbp promoters including the previously identified crs- <dig> and g-rich repressor elements. the presence of multiple klf <dig> binding sites suggests that transcriptional repression is likely to play an important role in regulation of photoreceptor-specific genes. based on the known expression of klf <dig> in retinal and non-retinal tissues and the absence of klf <dig> expression in photoreceptors, we hypothesize an in vivo role for klf <dig> in repressing photoreceptor-specific gene expression in non-photoreceptor cells.
