BACKGROUND
the innate immune system detects and eliminates invading foreign material through non-specific defense mechanisms elicited by, e.g., mononuclear phagocytes . mnps originate as monoblasts in the bone marrow, reside as monocytes  in blood and become, e.g., tissue macrophages  or dendritic cells  upon extravasation into tissues. the innate immune system is presumably involved when biological response modifiers  are utilized in the treatment of diseases such as cancer  <cit>  and lymphangiomas  <cit> . killed bacterial toxins  <cit>  along with bacillus calmette-guerin   <cit> , β-glucan  <cit> , interferons  <cit>  and monoclonal antibodies  <cit>  are examples of brms used in cancer treatment.

japan has a long standing tradition in using penicillin-killed lyophilized streptococcus pyogenes, denominated ok- <dig> or picibanil, as a biological response modifier  for treatment of cancer  <cit> . sakamoto et al.  <cit>  published in  <dig> a meta-analysis showing a 20% 5-year survival improvement with immunochemotherapy, compared to chemotherapy alone, following ok- <dig> treatment in patients diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer. this meta-analysis was based on  <dig>  patients enrolled in  <dig> randomized clinical phase iii trials. furthermore, oba et al  <cit>  published in  <dig> a meta-analysis including  <dig> gastric carcinoma patients from  <dig> randomized clinical phase iii trials and concluded that compared to control conditions, addition of ok- <dig> treatment increased survival. there are also reports suggesting that patients with other cancers, such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma   <cit> , may benefit from ok- <dig> treatment. ok- <dig> has also been used as a maturation factor for dcs cells as part of vaccination therapy of cancer patients  <cit> .

lymphangiomas are benign neoplasias of lymphatic origin, often congenital, that may extend around vital structures  <cit> . surgical removal of lymphangiomas has been the standard treatment, but may be technically difficult. injection of ok- <dig> into cystic lymphangioma lesions may lead to shrinkage and subsequent cure as first reported by ogita  <cit> . today, injection with ok- <dig> is established as a major treatment option for lymphangiomas  <cit> , and is an important example of the use of brms in medicine.

ok- <dig> presumably exerts its effect by activating the immune system to secrete toxic substances, which in turn eliminate tumor cells  <cit> . it is, however, relatively little known about the mechanisms of action of ok- <dig>  the principal cells responding to the drug, the engaged receptors or signal transduction pathways, are to a surprisingly large extent unknown. this should be an important area of study. the efficiency of ok- <dig> treatment needs to be improved in order to make ok- <dig> a better cancer treatment drug. additional drugs, which could improve ok-432's response, as well as studying to what extent other  drugs potentially interfere with the receptors and signal transduction pathways driving the ok- <dig> response, should therefore be determined as to optimize and improve treatment.

furthermore,s. pyogenes is an important pathogen causing human disease. the diseases caused by s. pyogenes range from tonsillitis, impetigo, necrotizing fasciitis, and scarlet fever to lethal toxic shock syndrome  <cit> . thus, studying the interactions of ok- <dig> with the immune system may shed light into the biology of these diseases as well.

one major mnp function is secretion of chemokines, such as monocyte chemoattractant protein  - <dig> and macrophage inflammatory protein  -1α/β  <cit> . chemokines have been shown to be secreted in response to ok- <dig> stimulation  <cit>  and have the main effect of attracting new leucocytes to the site from where they are secreted  <cit> . it should be of interest, to determine the modality of chemokine secretion from mos and mϕs upon ok- <dig> stimulation. we have therefore found it pertinent to address this issue in the present investigation.

priming provided by adherence, presumably associated with mnp differentiation from mo to mϕ, contributes to interleukin secretion following ok- <dig> mnp stimulation  <cit> . therefore, it is of interest to study to what extent the mnp chemokine response to ok- <dig> depends on adherence. molecularly, we have found it relevant to investigate the role of β-integrin receptors, as these receptors participate during differentiation of mnp from mo to mϕ. furthermore, these receptors may be functionally blocked by addition of piceatannol  and/or ly <dig> - <dig> kinase inhibitor)  <cit> . ok- <dig> may stimulate tlr receptors. in addition to ok- <dig>  we have studied chemokine secretion upon stimulation with the known tlr <dig> agonist lta and tlr <dig> agonist lps. moreover, we explored the role of the tlr <dig> co-receptor cd <dig>  <cit>  in ok- <dig> stimulation.

we have determined that in vitro purified adherent mnps may secrete chemokines mcp- <dig>  mip-1α and mip-1β following ok- <dig> stimulation. mos deprived of adherence did not respond to ok- <dig> stimulation as assessed by chemokine secretion. inhibition of syk and pi- <dig> kinase did not block the stimulatory effect of ok- <dig>  mip-1α/β production in wb and mos was higher upon stimulation with lta or lps while ok- <dig> stimulation gave a higher mcp- <dig> secretion in wb and mos in comparison with lta or lps. cd <dig>  and to some extent cd <dig>  participate in the ok-432-modulated mnp chemokine response.

RESULTS
in vitro chemokine production in unstimulated cultures
upon adherence, only mcp- <dig> was to some extent secreted . upon low adherence conditions, mcp- <dig> and mip-1α/β were secreted at all studied conditions .

chemokine production following ok- <dig> stimulation
at all tested regular growth conditions, ok- <dig> stimulated the release of mip-1α/β, and mcp- <dig>  . we determined a similar secretion for mcp- <dig> and mip-1α/β upon stimulating pbmcs versus mos . stimulated wb gave a lower mip-1α secretion compared to pbmcs or mos . the effect of ok- <dig> was also tested with mos from hnscc patients giving the same chemokine response profile as healthy controls . with respect to mcp- <dig>  close correlation between protein levels and mrna levels was observed in three healthy donors  as well as two hnscc patients, tested on two separate days  suggesting a pre-transcriptional regulation upon in vitro ok- <dig> stimulation of mos.

chemokine production following ok- <dig> versus lta or lps stimulation
tested were wb  and mos  stimulated in parallel with ok- <dig> or lta  or lps . in wb stimulated with ok- <dig> or lta, the response was primarily seen with mcp- <dig>  and only to some extent with mip-1α/β, whereas the lps-stimulated response was determined by mip-1α/β secretion. in purified mos, ok- <dig> and lta stimulated secretion of mcp- <dig>  lps inhibited mcp- <dig> production. thus, it appears that ok- <dig> stimulation is more akin to lta than to lps stimulation.

chemokine production following ok- <dig> stimulation of wb, pbmcs and mos cultured on regular or low-attachment culture wells
chemokine secretion was compared in wb and mnps cultured on regular  or low-attachment  wells . in wb, the mcp- <dig> response was reduced by 90% at the l compared to the r condition . in pbmcs, mip-1α response was abolished at the l condition  <dig> ±  <dig>  vs - <dig> ±  <dig>  ng/ml; p <  <dig> ). furthermore, mip-1β response was reduced by 74% , and the mcp- <dig> response by 94% . in mos, mcp- <dig>  response was completely blocked, while mip-1α was reduced by 92%  <dig>  ±  <dig>  vs  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml; p <  <dig> ) and mip-1β by 98%  <dig>  ±  <dig>  vs  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml; p <  <dig> ). thus, it appears that chemokine responses following ok-432-stimulation are almost absent if the cells are minimally allowed to adhere to a surface.

chemokine production following ok- <dig> stimulation of pbmc, mo-depleted pbmcs or mos
chemokine secretion was determined from pbmcs, mos separated by adherence and mo-depleted pbmcs . mo-depleted pbmcs  and mos secreted 18% and 36% of the pbmc-derived mcp- <dig>  respectively . thus, mos are the major source for mcp- <dig> production. in contrast, pbmcs stimulated with lps gave a negative mcp- <dig> production since stimulation with lps gives lower mcp- <dig> secretions compared to media controls.

stimulation of mos with ok- <dig> is independent of syk and pi- <dig> kinase
in order to determine whether syk kinase activation was necessary for the observed chemokine production in ok-432-stimulated mos, the syk kinase inhibitor piceatannol ,  <dig> μm ,  <dig> μm  or  <dig>  μm , or diluent control, was added for  <dig> minutes to adherent mos prior to addition of ok- <dig> for  <dig> hours. western blot  analysis  shows that syk kinase becomes phosphorylated following adherence of mos and is further phosphorylated following ok- <dig> stimulation but this phosphorylation is substantially reduced in mos exposed to piceatannol  for  <dig> min before stimulation with ok- <dig> for an additional  <dig> min. addition of piceatannol had no effect on chemokine production, as measured by mcp- <dig>  in human mos unless it was used at high, unspecific concentrations  . with respect to mrna, mcp- <dig> levels are also reduced when exposed for  <dig> min to  <dig> μm piceatannol followed by 24-hour incubation with ok- <dig> . thus, piceatannol, at high, likely unspecific, concentrations  lowers mcp- <dig> secretion while at low, specific, concentrations , has no effect on the tested chemokines, despite exhibiting efficacy in lowering syk kinase phosphorylation.

the role of pi- <dig> kinase in ok-432's ability to stimulate mos was tested where ly <dig>  or wortmannin  was added for  <dig> min to freshly isolated mos followed by incubation with ok- <dig> for  <dig> hours. western blot analysis  shows that pi- <dig> kinase is not phosphorylated following adherence of mos but becomes phosphorylated following ok- <dig> stimulation. this ok-432-dependent pi- <dig> kinase phosphorylation is decreased when mos are exposed to ly <dig> for  <dig> min before stimulation with ok- <dig> for  <dig> min. addition of ly <dig>  or wortmannin  did not significantly reduce mip-1α, mip-1β, or mcp- <dig> production in ok-432-stimulated mos. furthermore, a combination of piceatannol  , and ly <dig>  , or diluent control , was used throughout the entire mo isolation procedure as well as during incubation with media  or ok- <dig> for an additional  <dig> hours . incubation with media blocked spontaneous in vitro secretion of all tested chemokines, but no significant effect was observed in the ability of mos to produce mip-1α, and mip-1β upon ok- <dig> stimulation. on the contrary, mcp- <dig> production appears to be augmented following ok- <dig> stimulation, pointing to the existence of an additional mcp- <dig> pathway, dependent on syk and pi- <dig> kinase, throughout the isolation and adherence protocol.

role of β2-integrin  during stimulation of mos with ok-432
treating mos with a neutralizing f – anti-cd <dig> antibody  prior to ok- <dig> stimulation, the secretion of mcp- <dig> , but not the other tested chemokines, decreased. thus, the β <dig> integrin  may possibly be involved in mcp- <dig> secretion following ok- <dig> activation of human isolated mos.

role of cd <dig> on stimulation of mos with ok-432
anti-cd <dig> antibody or isotype control was added to wells followed by addition of pbmcs, incubated for  <dig> min, and ok- <dig> was added for an additional  <dig> hours . cd <dig> addition decreased mip-1β and mcp- <dig>  but not mip-1α secretion. thus, in mos, ok- <dig> elicits both mip-1β and mcp- <dig> production in part via cd <dig> acting as a co-receptor.

discussion
we have studied in vitro ok-432-stimulated mononuclear mnps chemokine secretion. purified mos, pbmcs or wb secreted mcp- <dig>  mip-1α, and mip-1β following ok- <dig> stimulation at a similar rate, except for a substantially lower mip-1α secretion from wb. this is in line with other investigators, e.g., showing that s. pyogenes directly activates mϕs to secrete chemokines  <cit> . cytokine mrna quantification of mcp- <dig> transcripts showed that ok- <dig> stimulation was followed by cytokine mrna synthesis within hours. there was a correlation between measured cytokine mrna levels and cytokine-secreted levels suggesting that ok- <dig> mainly exerts its effects at the pre-transcriptional level. we furthermore separated by adherence most of the mos from a sample of pbmcs. upon ok- <dig> stimulation both these cell fractions secreted mcp- <dig> at about twice the level of the mo-depleted fraction. these findings support that mnps are the main source for mcp- <dig> within pbmcs. ok- <dig> also elicited a chemokine response in purified mos from hnscc patients.

all studied chemokines were secreted without particular stimulation factors at low adherence conditions, whereas mip-1α/β secretion was completely inhibited by adherence. at low adherence conditions, the secretion response of mip-1α/β and mcp- <dig> from pbmcs and mos was abolished upon ok- <dig> stimulation. this might indicate that mnps undergoing adherence fundamentally alter their chemokine secretion responses and supports that mo to mϕ differentiation interferes with the regulation of chemokine secretion. this is also supported by our observations of mip-1α-derived ok- <dig> stimulated secretion being lower in wb compared to pbmcs and mos. diapedesis depends on, e.g., integrin receptor engagement co-triggering differentiation of mos to mϕs  <cit> . such stimulation may be provided when mos are isolated by in vitro adherence. syk phosphorylation is a necessary part of β1– <dig> integrin-generated activation  <cit> , whereas pi- <dig> kinase phosphorylation is required in β <dig> integrin-generated activation  <cit> . we have presently shown that adherence of mos stimulated phosphorylation of syk but not pi- <dig> kinase, as determined by western blots. thus, it appears that possibly both β <dig> and αvβ <dig> integrins, but not β <dig> integrin, play a role in mediating mo adhesion. based on western blots, binding of ok- <dig> to mos elicited a higher syk phosphorylation compared to unstimulated mos, possibly suggesting an adherence-mediated priming effect. pi- <dig> kinase phosphorylation occurred only upon stimulation with ok- <dig>  we have shown that addition of either one of these inhibitors to ok-432-stimulated mos did not change chemokine secretion. on the contrary, with addition of both of these inhibitors, mcp- <dig> secretion was increased, pointing to the existence of other possible signaling pathways. in addition, presence of both inhibitors throughout the isolation and separation of monocytes blocked the unstimulated secretion of chemokines supporting that β integrins are important for chemokine secretion during the adhesion process. our observed syk phosphorylation upon ok- <dig> binding pointed towards an integrin dependence and resonated with cuzzola et al  <cit> , who have shown that the mo interleukin response to group a streptococci  was dependent on the β <dig> integrin. we explored whether this applied to the ok-432-mediated activation of mos by adding a blocking anti-cd <dig> antibody. mcp- <dig> production appears to be partially inhibited by the anti-cd <dig> antibody. thus, the β <dig> integrin may play a role in mediating the effects of ok- <dig> on mos. nevertheless, other receptors may phosphorylate either syk or pi- <dig> kinase or both and their nature has yet to be established.

ok- <dig> probably stimulates mos via tlr <dig>  <cit>  and/or tlr <dig>  <cit> . in order to study the role of these receptors, mos were stimulated in parallel with ok- <dig>  and the known tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> agonists, lta and lps, respectively. results showed that mos respond to ok- <dig> in a similar fashion to lta stimulation, thus, arguing for primary tlr2-dependent stimulation of mos by ok- <dig> 

a potential candidate for co-stimulation of mos is cd <dig>  this receptor has been found to function as a co-receptor for tlr <dig> receptor  <cit> . we determined a reduced mip-1β and mcp- <dig>  but an unchanged mip-1α response upon employing blocking anti-cd <dig> antibodies. thus, cd <dig> may function as an important receptor in the ok- <dig> stimulation of mos with respect to chemokine secretion.

other co-stimulating receptors than the presently shown ones may be important for chemokine production following ok- <dig> stimulation of mnps. examples include cd62l , a mediator of mos rolling on and interacting with endothelial cells  <cit>  and cd <dig> , a promoter in the interaction between mos and platelets  <cit> . future studies are needed to establish their roles in ok- <dig> stimulation in mos.

the shown mnp stage-dependence for mip-1α secretion and adherence-dependent chemokine response to ok- <dig> supports the hypothesis that chemokine secretion is less favoured when mos are stimulated by ok- <dig> in pb compared to extravasal stimulation. this is in line with our previous observation that tnf-α is primarily secreted upon ok- <dig> stimulation after initiation of mo differentiation  <cit> . the present report thus adds more support to the notion that ok- <dig> is a target-seeking substance. only when mnps are stimulated by, e.g., tumor cells or intercellular substances  <cit> , one observes a chemokine response. the present results argue in favor of chemokine secretion being an important effector function of mnps during ok- <dig> stimulation. this is important as to designing future brm treatments with ok- <dig>  platinum-based drugs, e.g., negatively interfere more with monocyte than lymphocyte function  <cit>  and should thus be avoided in combination with ok- <dig> treatment.

mip-1α/β and mcp- <dig> secretion is induced by stimulation of mos with ok- <dig>  these chemokines are ligands of the receptors cxcr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  present on polymorphonuclear granulocytes, basophiles, granulocytes, mos, mϕs, dcs, nk cells, t, and b cells  <cit> . thus, the shown chemokine secretion after ok- <dig> stimulation of mos may co-explain the systemic effects of ok- <dig> on the immune system. similar findings were made by veckman et al  <cit>  upon stimulating mϕs with pathogenic live bacteria ) isolated from a child with bacteremia. in contrast, we have stimulated monocytes with a heat- and penicillin g-killed, low-virulence su strain of s. pyogenes and found very low levels of rantes . therefore, it is plausible that virulence status/degree, strain, and preparation of bacteria influence chemokine production and mos may have a different chemokine profile compared to mϕs. this becomes especially interesting when the emphasis is on ok- <dig> being a lyophilized, killed s. pyogenes. s. pyogenes is an important pathogen causing human disease. the diseases caused by s. pyogenes range from tonsillitis, impetigo, and scarlet fever to lethal toxic shock syndrome  <cit> . the shown mechanisms of mnp activation by ok- <dig> thus shed light on these diseases as well.

CONCLUSIONS
we have found that mcp- <dig> and mip-1α/β production by ok-432-stimulated human purified adherent mos occurs in most healthy individuals. mip-1α secretion is mostly found following differentiation stimuli of mos to become mϕs. furthermore, mos stimulated with ok- <dig> respond with chemokine secretion dependent on adherent growth conditions. ok- <dig> may rely on β <dig> integrin stimulation. cd <dig> modulates the mip-1β and mcp- <dig> response to ok- <dig>  to some extent ok- <dig> may act as a target-seeking substance whereby only mos adhered, e.g., to a target, secrete substantial amounts of chemokines in part explaining why ok- <dig> is suited as a brm drug.
