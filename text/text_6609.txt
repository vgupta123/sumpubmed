BACKGROUND
according to the barker hypothesis of developmental origins of health and disease , susceptibility to certain common diseases such as hypertension and type  <dig> diabetes may be related to poor environmental condition early in life  <cit> . poor fetal and/or early postnatal condition during critical growth phases may alter the structural and physiologic functional development of vital organs regulating blood sugar and blood pressure, thus predetermining the susceptibility to hypertension and diabetes in adulthood. poor fetal nutrition may lead to a “thrifty” phenotype that selectively protects the growth of the most vital organs  at the expense of the less vital ones  during fetal development  <cit> . such fetal adaptations increase the chance of survival in an adverse intrauterine environment, but they impair metabolic functional capacity in coping with metabolic stressors in postnatal life. animal studies have provided strong evidence that poor fetal nutrition leads to low birth weight in offspring and increased blood pressure in adulthood  <cit> . due to multiple practical reasons, direct evidence connecting prenatal environmental condition and adult life health consequences in humans has been sparse.

in the literature, controversial results have been reported for linking early life events with disease at adult ages. in a recent epidemiological study on the birth weight discordant monozygotic twins included in the present study, frost et al.  <cit>  found no effect of low birth weight on glucose metabolism. likewise, petersen et al.
 <cit>  reported no indication of increased occurrence of type  <dig> diabetes among twins who on average are about 1 kg lighter at birth than singletons. despite the negative findings, significant associations have been frequently reported. for example, iliadou et al.
 <cit>  reported an inverse association between birth weight and the risk of type  <dig> diabetes; wannamethee et al.  <cit>  found lower birth weight in monozygotic twins with type  <dig> diabetes compared to their co-twins. the inconsistent findings from epidemiological studies on disease endpoints call for new approaches in the search for evidences of an association between intrauterine growth and metabolic dysfunction.

epigenetics is the study of changes in gene expression or cellular phenotype, caused by mechanisms other than changes in the underlying dna sequence. as opposed to traditional epidemiologic approaches that seek indirect evidence by associating environmental exposure with disease outcome, epigenetic epidemiology searches for direct molecular evidence that links environmental factors to epigenetic regulation of genes and to the development of diseases  <cit> . the molecular mechanism of epigenetic control over gene activity involves dna methylation, chromatin modification, regulatory non-coding rnas  including post-transcriptional regulation by microrna , etc. of the various epigenetic regulation mechanisms, dna methylation is the major form of epigenetic modification that is most robust and readily measurable using high throughput techniques, for example the illumina’s infinium humanmethylation <dig> beadchip assay, for methylation profiling at genome scale  <cit> .

monozygotic  twins share genetics and uterus, albeit not necessarily the same intrauterine environment  <cit> . therefore, mz twins and especially birth weight discordant mz pairs provide an extraordinary opportunity to investigate the association between early life factors and adult life health while controlling for not only genetics but also postnatal environments  <cit> . in a recent study, souren et al.
 <cit>  conducted genome-wide dna methylation profiling in saliva on  <dig> pairs of mz twins discordant for birth weight and reported indistinguishable patterns of dna methylation. considering the limited power in their study due to very small sample size, we performed a relatively large-scale epigenomic association analysis on blood samples from adult danish mz twins discordant for birth weight with the aim of identifying genomic regions under differential methylation in association with birth weight discordance.

RESULTS
samples of birth weight discordant twins
in table  <dig>  we show the descriptive statistics of the  <dig> pairs of mz twins. among them,  <dig> pairs were male and  <dig> pairs female twins. at recruitment, the youngest twin pair was 30 years and the oldest 74 years. from the age distribution, as shown in figure  <dig>  there are two age groups of twins with age intervals from  <dig> to  <dig> in the younger twins and from  <dig> to  <dig> in the older twins. the age gap of 20 years was caused by a “gap” in the registered data available for birth weight. intra-pair birth weight difference ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> grams with a median of  <dig> grams. based on absolute birth weight difference, we calculated percentage of difference in birth weight  as absolute birth weight difference divided by the birth weight of the larger twin, i.e.

*young twins were born after  <dig> and old twins born before  <dig>  gestational age was available after  <dig> from the danish medical birth registry.

as shown by figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  the calculated ∆bw% ranges from  <dig> % to  <dig> % with a median of  <dig> %. from the figure, we see that the male  and female  twins are evenly distributed over age and by ∆bw%. however, the degree of discordance seems higher in the young twins than in the old twins. this is confirmed by statistical testing with a p value of  <dig>  .

ewas on birth weight discordant twins
dna methylation data was analysed by a linear mixed effects model  <cit>  that contained fixed effects for qualitative  as well as quantitative or degree of birth weight discordance. the model was capable of estimating the effect on dna methylation from birth weight discordance in general defined as a binary trait and from degree of birth weight discordance defined as a quantitative trait . in addition to the fixed effect covariates described in the method section, our mixed model specified sample plate, well, and sentrix position as random variables to account for batch effect and random effects due to sample allocation on the infinium beadchip in the array experiment. results from our ewas revealed no cpg sites significantly associated with either qualitative or quantitative  birth weight discordance at genome-wide level pre-defined as false discovery rate  <  <dig> . although no genome-wide statistical significance was seen, the cpg site cg <dig> located in the gene body of the rgma gene on chromosomes  <dig> had the lowest p value of  <dig> e- <dig>  corresponding to a fdr of  <dig>  for degree of birth weight discordance. dna methylation level at this site seemed to become higher in the smaller twins than in the bigger twins with increasing percentage of discordance. figure 2a is the manhattan plot for ewas on qualitative discordance and figure 2b for quantitative discordance.figure  <dig>

ewas on extreme birth weight discordant twins
as shown in table  <dig>  there is a big difference in the degree of birth weight discordance among the twin pairs ranging from  <dig> to 47%. with this in mind, we performed our second ewas on samples with extreme birth weight discordance. to do that we selected twin pairs with ∆bw% >25% since a birth weight difference of over 25% is supposed to represent a pathologic process  <cit> . a total of  <dig> pairs were selected for further analysis with a median of 30% in birth weight difference. the same mixed model was applied for analysis of the extremely discordant twins. figure  <dig> displays the manhattan plots for the p values from ewas on qualitative  and quantitative  discordance. again, no site showed genome-wide statistical significance for qualitative or quantitative discordance. the cpg site  had the lowest p value of  <dig> e- <dig> . the site is located in the first exon of the cd <dig> gene on chromosome  <dig>  the smaller twins were characterized by higher methylation at this site than the bigger twins with increasing percentage of birth weight discordance.figure  <dig>

age- and sex-dependent intra-pair differential dna methylation
in table  <dig>  the median ages for the young and the old twins have a gap of 30 years. by specifying age as a pair-specific fixed effect covariate, we were able to examine if there were significant intra-pair differential dna methylation patterns that were age-dependent. likewise, sex-dependent intra-pair differential methylation can also be captured by our model with sex included as a pair-specific fixed effect covariate. our ewas on the whole sample did not find any age- or sex-dependent pattern on intra-pair differential methylation at genome-wide level . however, for the selected samples of extremely discordant twins,  <dig> cpg sites showed genome-wide statistical significance for age-dependent intra-pair differential methylation with fdr  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   . among the  <dig> sites, cg <dig> became highly methylated with increasing age in the bigger than in the smaller twins, but the pattern was reversed for cg <dig> and cg <dig>  i.e., higher methylation in the smaller than in the bigger twins. the  <dig> cpgs are located on chromosomes  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . the  <dig> sites, cg <dig> and cg <dig> were not linked to any genes. the lowest p value of  <dig> e- <dig> for sex-dependent effects was achieved by cg <dig> on chromosome  <dig> with fdr =  <dig>  . there was no site exhibiting genome-wide statistical significance for sex-dependent effect in the selected samples .

discussion
we have conducted a genome-wide dna methylation profiling in whole blood samples of identical twins discordant for birth weight. although with a large sample size of  <dig> twin pairs, our ewas did not detect any cpg sites differentially methylated at genome-wide statistical significance, neither for qualitative nor for quantitative concordance. even for the extremely discordant twins, no genome-wide statistical significance was found for qualitative or quantitative discordance. overall, our results seem to support the conclusion drawn by souren et al.
 <cit> , i.e. there is no obvious epigenetic signature for birth weight discordance in the adult twins. in a recent study, engel et al.  <cit>  reported  <dig> significant cpg sites associated with birth-weight in the cord blood of a large sample of  <dig> infants. the lack of replication from our study could be due to the fact that the two studies focused on different stages of life and the measured dna methylation status in infants does not necessarily represent that in adults. similar studies in the adult population should provide valuable validation to our conclusion.

contrary to the analytical method used by souren et al.  <cit> , our mixed effects model is capable of measuring age- and sex-dependent effects on intra-pair differential methylation. although no age- or sex-dependent pattern was found in the whole sample of  <dig> twin pairs, in the extremely discordant twin pairs with ∆bw% >25%,  <dig> cpg sites had genome-wide statistical significance for their age-dependent effects on intra-pair differential dna methylation with fdrs  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  . the odds ratio for intra-pair differential methylation was calculated as  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, for a period of 10 years. although with a small effect size, the significant age-dependent effect indicates that the epigenetic impact of birth weight discordance could be expressed progressively as either increasing or decreasing dna methylation levels with increasing age.

using the same study population of twins as the one included in the present study, frost et al.  <cit>  performed an epidemiological analysis of birth weight discordance and glucose metabolism and found no evidence for a detrimental effect of low birth weight on glucose metabolism including beta cell function, insulin resistance, insulin sensitivity and acute insulin response, even in twin pairs with a large intra-pair difference in birth weight. in general, our results are in agreement with these epidemiological findings, although  <dig> cpgs showed genome-wide statistical significance for their age-dependent effect in the extremely discordant twins. the significant age-dependent effect on intra-pair differential methylation from the extremely discordant twins prompted us to speculate whether they were distinct from the rest of twin pairs. so, we examined whether the extremely discordant twins were different from the rest of twins in term of preterm birth defined as birth with gestational age shorter than  <dig> complete weeks. in additional file 3: table s <dig>  we show the count of twin pairs stratified by gestational age  and by ∆bw%  in young twins, a group whose gestational ages were recorded by the danish medical birth registry starting from early 1970s. the statistical test showed that the proportion of preterm twin pairs in the extremely discordant twin pairs  is significantly higher than that in the rest of the twins  . in the older twins, exact gestational age was not available, and only for some of the twins, estimated gestational age was known. of the  <dig> old twin pairs with ∆bw% ≥ <dig>  five had missing data for gestational age and the remaining  <dig> all belonged to the group with a gestational age ≤ <dig> estimated weeks. altogether, the extremely discordant twins were significantly over-represented by preterm twins who might have different clinical characteristics as compared to other birth weight discordant twins.

the degree of methylation could differ between monochorionic and dichorionic monozygotic twins, presumably because variation in nutrition is lower in the latter  <cit> . information on chorionicity was not available in our study, and we cannot exclude the possibility that the results would have been different, had we investigated either mono- or dichorionic monozygotic twins. in addition, monozygotic twins may not be entirely genetically identical. mosaicism for de novo mutations  <cit> , differences in copy-number variations  <cit> , and post-zygotic mutations  <cit>  may all contribute to genetic differences between monozygotic twins and, potentially, the pattern of dna methylation under investigation.

in the present study, dna methylation was assessed in white blood cells, i.e. cells derived from the mesoderm, whereas, souren et al.
 <cit>  used saliva, which comprises cells originating from both the mesoderm and the ectoderm . the relative importance of the tissue used for assessment of the methylation profile is uncertain. the heritability of the methylome is lower in white blood cells than in buccal tissue  <cit> , and the epigenome differed significantly between the four tissues investigated in monozygotic twins by ollikainen et al.
 <cit> , suggesting that selection of tissue may influence the investigations. we have no knowledge of any potential difference in dna methylation that could be caused by intrauterine growth impairment in relevant tissues such as muscle, fat and liver, and emphasize that the finding from the current study only reflects changes observed in whole blood samples and may not be generalized to other tissues. since the difference in birth-weight was observed at end of gestation, the epigenetic patterns associated with it could then be tissue-specific and consequently too late to be seen in the blood. in this regard, biologically more relevant tissues could help with identifying the epigenetic patterns associated with birth-weight discordance.

overall, our results did not show significant epigenetic profiles associated with birth weight discordance in identical twins, a conclusion that is in agreement with frost et al.  <cit>  who reported no detrimental effect of low birth weight on glucose metabolism in the same twin samples as those used in the current study. meanwhile, our study is limited by the use of whole blood as target tissue, limited sample size for genome-wide association analysis and low coverage of the methylation chips. future studies which include larger study populations and samples from biologically appropriate tissues using e.g. next generation sequencing techniques should be able to provide more evidence of whether birth weight has any effect on later life dna methylation and to verify the epigenetic basis of dohad.

CONCLUSIONS
results from an ewas based on our relatively large sample size of twins did not reveal significant epigenetic signature for birth weight discordance. even in the extremely birth weight discordant twin pairs who were dominated by preterm birth, no statistically significant results were found except for some age-dependent effects. in conclusion, our data did not show molecular evidence of differential dna methylation in adult twin pairs discordant for birth weight.
