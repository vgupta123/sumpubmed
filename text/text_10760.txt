BACKGROUND
salinity has become a major constraint in crop production. understanding the mechanisms, which enable growth under saline conditions is of high scientific and agricultural interest  <cit> . sodium uptake and distribution within the plant is a major determinant for the salt sensitivity of a plant. sustained exposure to elevated salt concentrations leads to the transfer and accumulation of nacl in the shoot tissue, where it can inhibit leaf growth. prevention of na+ entry into the root, transport to and allocation within the leaf, and sequestration into the vacuole are strategies with which plants cope with high salt environment. accordingly, the overexpression of the vacuolar na+/h+ antiporter nhx <dig>  for instance, improves salt-tolerance in arabidopsis  <cit> . within the shoot, ion allocation can vary between cell types as found in mesophyll and epidermis of barley and wheat, where differences for k+ and cl- were measured  <cit> . na+ can either be retained in older leaves reducing transport to young organs or translocated to petioles and leaf margins to protect the lamina from excessive entry of salt as described for medicago citrine and ricinus communis  <cit> . hence, control of na+ and k+ fluxes on the whole plant level guarantees the maintenance of a high cytosolic k+/na+-ratio, which is crucial for growth in saline soils. in arabidopsis, transporters contributing to na+ homeostasis include plasma membrane  and vacuolar na+/h+ antiporters , and the plasma membrane uniporter hkt <dig>  <cit> .

atsos <dig> is expressed in epidermal cells at the root tip and in xylem parenchyma cells of roots and shoots  <cit> . altogether, data showed that sos <dig> controls na+ extrusion out of the root and long-distance transport, limiting na+ accumulation in plant cells. the ability of tomato  plants to retain na+ in the stems, and thus to prevent na+ from reaching the photosynthetic tissues, is largely dependent on the function of slsos <dig>  the functional homolog of atsos <dig>  <cit> .

while nhx <dig> and sos <dig> export na+ from the cytosol on the expense of the proton gradient, na+ entry follows its electrochemical gradient. members of two gene families, the high affinity k+ transporter family hkt, and the cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel family, cngc, have been shown to mediate na+ uptake and regulation of long distance transport. proteins belonging to the hkt family control na+ unloading in the xylem of arabidopsis, rice and wheat  <cit> , and therefore control the long-distance transport of na+ to the leaf. the arabidopsis genome contains a single hkt homolog, athkt <dig>  which belongs to the subfamily of hkt transporters that encode low affinity na+ uniporters. loss-of-function mutations in athkt <dig> render plants na+ hypersensitive and disturb the distribution of na+ between roots and shoots.

members of the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel  family belong to the group of nonselective cation channels and enable the uptake of na+, k+, and ca2+ <cit> . cng channels are assumed to activate upon binding of cellular camp or cgmp to the ligand-binding site. within the c-terminus of the channel, a partially overlapping binding domain for calmodulin allows ca2+-calmodulin binding and is proposed to destabilize the open state. functional expression of plant cng channels in xenopus oocytes or animal cell lines has not been reproducibly successful; hence a detailed biophysical characterization of these channels including their gating and permeation characteristics still remains to be performed. the arabidopsis cngc gene family comprises  <dig> members  <cit> . phenotypical analysis of loss-of-function mutants showed that members play a role in plant growth and the response to pathogen attack  <cit> . cngc <dig> is involved in arabidopsis' tolerance towards salt. mature plants of cngc <dig> antisense lines were more sensitive to salt stress and contained higher na+ concentrations in shoots compared with wild-type  <cit> . in contrast, salt-grown seedlings of the antisense lines developed longer roots compared to the wild type. likewise, cngc <dig> mutant seedlings showed slightly enhanced growth in the presence of elevated nacl or kcl concentrations compared to wild type plants  <cit> . so far, members tested have been localized in the plasma membrane  <cit> , suggesting a direct function in cation entry into the cell.

in this study, we show that both cngc <dig> and cngc <dig> respond to salinity with increased gene activity and accumulation of transcripts in the shoot. salt treatment of roots or cut leaves induced the shoot regulation of cngc <dig>  suggesting that nacl itself is the root-to-shoot signal. although the loss of either channel did not lead to a salt-related growth phenotype, the strong upregulation by nacl underlines their role in the salinity response, which is discussed on the basis of their distinct expression pattern.

RESULTS
we investigated the expression pattern and regulation by salt stress of the group iva of arabidopsis cng channels  <cit> , consisting of cngc <dig> and cngc <dig>  both genes are arranged in tandem on chromosome  <dig>  on the amino acid level, the two proteins share 73% identity.

distinct expression patterns of cngc <dig> and cngc20
the age- and tissue-dependent expression pattern was visualized in plants expressing β-glucuronidase under the control of the cng channel promoter. in case of cngc <dig>  blue staining was visible starting one day after the radicle's emergence from the seedling. promoter activity was detected mainly in roots and to a lesser extent in shoots of plants of different developmental stages . cngc <dig> showed expression only in the vasculature, and was observed during the development of lateral roots, as soon as the stelar long-distance transport system develops. it was not detected in root meristematic tissue . the staining of two strands within the stele indicated that the expression is located in phloem tissue . this was supported by the staining of root cross sections . in the shoot, cngc <dig> promoter activity was observed in the vasculature, too .

gus staining in plants expressing the β-glucuronidase gene under control of the cngc <dig> promoter was visible in the roots of young seedlings , but was more pronounced in shoot tissue of mature plants , as well as in the carpel  and crown leaves of flowers . while within the root, cortex tissue was stained, in the shoot cngc <dig> gene expression was mainly observed in the mesophyll tissue surrounding the veins and in the petioles . expression in guard cells could also be observed . staining of epidermal cells, however, was weak. to test this, tobacco leaves were transiently transformed with a cngc <dig> promoter-gfp fusion construct. indeed, promoter activity was evident in epidermal cells .

data in this study indicate specific expression patterns for both genes. interestingly, cngc <dig> is found in the vasculature, which is surrounded by cngc <dig> expressing cells. thus, the two genes may fulfil similar functions in different but adjacent tissues.

cngc <dig> and cngc <dig> expression is regulated by salinity
previous publications reported on the participation of nonselective cation channels in the plant's response to salt stress  <cit> . to investigate possible effects of salinity on cngc <dig> and cngc <dig>  we monitored gene activities using reporter genes and quantitative rt-pcr. when plants transformed with cngc19p:gus were grown for one week on half-strength ms-agar in the absence or presence of  <dig> mm nacl, gus-staining of seedlings and whole plants revealed strong promoter activity in root tissue under both control and salt stress conditions . in the aerial parts of the plant, the staining intensity was increased in 65%  of the plants tested after the salt stress period compared to controls .

transgenic plants expressing the luciferase gene under the control of the cngc <dig> promoter were used to determine the gene activity as the luciferase luminescence intensity normalized to the protein content of tissue extracts . the relative luciferase luminescence in 12-day old plants was higher in root than in shoot tissue . the same approach was used to monitor gene regulation by nacl treatment. after application of  <dig> mm nacl to the root, cngc <dig> gene activity increased only in the shoot  but not in the root . the increase continued during  <dig> hours of salt stress, corresponding to a steady upregulation of cngc <dig> gene activity. in the presence of  <dig> mm mannitol, cngc <dig> was not affected in the same manner, indicating that the response was specific and mainly due to the ionic rather than the osmotic component of the stress. these results are well in agreement with whole genome array data on cdna isolated from 13-day old plants, which show a time-dependent accumulation of cngc <dig> transcripts in the shoot  <cit> . in the root, transcript levels rose transiently within the first hour after salt treatment, but returned to control levels within  <dig> hours.

kilian and colleagues  <cit>  did not detect a salt-dependent regulation of cngc <dig>  we therefore decided to test the salt-sensitivity at developmental stages, where cngc <dig> is predominantly expressed. 6-week old plants expressing luciferase under control of the cngc <dig> promoter reported indeed a salt-dependent increase in cngc <dig> expression . application of  <dig> mm nacl to roots led to a significant increase of luciferase in the leaves already within one hour, which then remained elevated during two days of constant salt stress . cngc <dig> was not upregulated in control conditions or in the presence of  <dig> mm mannitol. kinetics of the salt response of cngc <dig> indicated that tissue not directly in contact with the stress responded rapidly. to test, whether this could be due to the uptake and translocation of salt to the shoot tissue, the stress was applied directly to the leaves by putting the petioles of detached leaves into the nacl solution. as in the root treatment, cngc <dig> in the shoot responded within one hour as indicated by the increase in relative luminescence, while control treatments had no effect . salt-dependent regulation of cngc <dig> was supported by quantitative rt-pcr experiments. transcript abundance was assessed in detached leaves, revealing a salt-dependent increase of cngc <dig> transcript in the shoot , which was significantly different from controls.

together, promoter activities assessed by reporter genes and transcript levels determined by quantitative rt-pcr reported qualitatively similar results on the salt-dependent upregulation of cngc <dig> and cngc <dig> in leaves of mature plants. our data point to a physiological response to the accumulation of nacl itself rather than to an osmotic shock response. the results show that salt treatment of the root triggers a response of cngc <dig> in the leaf. such long-distance signaling from root to shoot might be mediated by hormones, such as abscisic acid   <cit> . however, the response of isolated leaves demonstrated that salt perception and signal transduction can take place in the aerial parts of the plant. thus, it appears likely that the regulation of cngc <dig> depends on the direct transfer of nacl to the shoot. it remains unclear in which cell types the signal perception takes place and whether this is the same for both genes. since cngc <dig> is expressed in phloem tissue and cngc <dig> in mesophyll cells nearby the phloem, it is interesting to note that the cngc <dig> induction kinetics saturates much earlier compared to that of cngc <dig>  whether or not this is related to the time-dependent distribution of nacl within the shoot remains to be clarified.

salt stress, like many other abiotic stresses, can elicit a transient increase in cytosolic ca2+  <cit> . in arabidopsis seedlings, cgmp levels increased rapidly  and to different degrees after salt and osmotic stress  <cit> . interestingly, donaldson and colleagues provided evidence that salt stress activates two cgmp signaling pathways - an osmotic, calcium-independent pathway and an ionic, calcium-dependent pathway. it is tempting to suggest that cngc <dig> and cngc <dig> might be suitable candidates taking part in these early responses, possibly linking cgmp- and ca2+-signaling.

increased expression of cngc <dig> was detected quickly within one hour. cngc <dig> responded a bit slower within  <dig> hours. the strong induction of the expression by nacl implies a function in the adaptation to salinity. in this respect it is interesting that salt stress affects both genes mainly in the shoot, where most dramatic changes occur  <cit> . control of na+ accumulation in the shoot is of major importance for the adaptation to salt stress. as most sensitive plants display poor ability to sequester na+ in leaf vacuoles, they have to rely on other mechanisms to cope with the na+ delivered to leaf cells. both cngc <dig> and cngc <dig> represent possible na+ entry pathways into cells, and could participate in the na+ distribution within the leaf. for instance, cngc <dig> could participate in na+ sequestration into phloem parenchyma cells and cngc <dig> in na+ sequestration into the mesophyll of petioles. a translocation of na+ to petioles is known from species that tolerate salt  <cit> , but might occur to a certain extent also in arabidopsis. since na+ is preferentially deposited in older leaves, a role in compartmentation is supported by the fact that cngc <dig> is mainly expressed in older leaves.

expression of cngc <dig> was detected in the phloem, strengthening the hypothesis about a function in phloem loading and unloading. cngc <dig> could be involved in na+ recirculation from shoots to roots, where na+ might be extruded, or at least in na+ redistribution between tissues. in the upper parts of the roots and in the stem, a direct transfer of sodium ions from xylem to phloem tissues is thought to play a role in the control of na+ translocation towards the shoot  <cit> . this would require na+ uptake into the phloem. na+ assays of the phloem sap revealed high concentrations up to  <dig> mm in some species  <cit> , but the physiological significance of such data was interpreted contradictorily  <cit> . according to the expression pattern and expected ion channel characteristics, it is tempting to hypothesize that cngc <dig>  similar to akt2/ <dig>  <cit> , might play a role in membrane potential stabilization and therewith might indirectly affect phloem loading of metabolites.

phenotypical analysis of cngc <dig> and cngc <dig> mutants
arabidopsis t-dna insertion lines from the salk collection  <cit>  were investigated with t-dna insertions in the first  and fourth exon , respectively . pcr using cdna isolated from wild type and mutants confirmed that cngc <dig> and cngc <dig> expression was virtually absent from the respective homozygous t-dna mutants .

we analyzed the cng channel mutants in conditions mimicking high salinity and in the presence of abscisic acid , which plays a crucial role in root-to-shoot and cellular signaling in response to salt stress  <cit> . although cngc <dig> is expressed in the root tissue of young seedlings, cngc19- <dig> displayed no root growth phenotype under control or saline  conditions. the growth was also not affected by  <dig> μm aba compared to the wild type . similarly, the germination was indistinguishable from wild type in the presence of  <dig> mm nacl or  <dig> μm aba . however, root growth is usually less affected than leaf growth during na+ toxicity, and the root elongation rate recovers remarkably well after exposure to nacl or other osmotica  <cit> . regarding the whole plant, it is primarily the mature leaf where na+ toxicity is manifested. as both cngc <dig> and cngc <dig> are upregulated in shoot tissue of salt-stressed plants, we compared the shoot growth of mutants and wild type. after a  <dig> day growth period on half-strength ms-agar, seedlings were transferred to agar plates containing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> mm nacl and grown for another twelve days. no salt-dependent phenotype could be observed for cngc19- <dig> and cngc20- <dig> mutants compared to the wild type .

to test if na+ or k+ accumulation is affected in the mutants, contents were determined with icp. although the plants displayed a reduction of fresh weights with increasing nacl content in the media , the k:na content ratio of wild type and mutant shoots of plants grown for twelve days on plates containing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> mm nacl did not differ . these findings suggest that both uptake of sodium/potassium and extrusion of na+ are unaltered in the mutants.

phenotypic characterization of loss-of-channel mutants does not allow deducing an explicit role of cngc <dig> and cngc <dig> during the nonselective uptake of na+ during salt stress. due to their expression pattern, they could be involved in salt stress-dependent signal transduction or distribution of sodium throughout the plant. in the mesophyll and the root cortex, the specific role of cngc <dig> might be masked by the activity of other nonselective cation channels having partially redundant functions. cngc <dig> and cngc <dig>  for instance, are both expressed in the root cortex. cngc <dig> loss-of-function mutants grew slightly better in the presence of  <dig> to  <dig> mm nacl  <cit> . this together with short and long-term na+ influx experiments led to the conclusion that cngc <dig> is functioning in sodium  influx. only during initial stages of salt stress, cngc <dig> contributed considerably to na+ influx. its participation in ion uptake in salinity-adapted plants seems to be limited  <cit> .

in leaves, cngc <dig> was located in the plasma membrane of mesophyll, palisade parenchyma and epidermal cells  <cit> . mature plants of cngc <dig> antisense lines were more sensitive towards salt stress and their shoots contained higher na+ concentrations compared with wild type  <cit> . gus staining showed that cngc <dig> expression in leaves is patchy; it comprised vascular tissue and mesophyll . thus, at least a partially redundant function to cngc <dig> appears possible.

apart from pollen-specific cngcs, the cngcs investigated so far show a broad expression pattern  <cit> . by comparison, expression of cngc <dig> is relatively confined. thus, further cell-type specific functional assays are required to assess its physiological role in planta.

CONCLUSIONS
cngc <dig> is expressed in the phloem and cngc <dig> in the epidermis and the mesophyll, mainly in petioles. upon salinity, both genes are upregulated within hours in the shoot, where most dramatic changes happen  <cit> . salt-dependent regulation of cngc <dig> occurred in the shoot, irrespective of whether nacl was applied to the roots of intact plants or to the petioles of detached leaves. at first glance, it seems puzzling that a cell promotes the upregulation of genes encoding proteins that provide na+ entry pathways and therefore would contribute to increase the cytosolic sodium levels. however, under severe salt stress, cng channels represent a fast and effective way to redistribute sodium throughout the whole plant. the fact that both cngc <dig> and cngc <dig> were upregulated by salt rather than by osmolytes indicates a role in salt adaptation. therefore we propose a distributive role for cngc <dig> and cngc <dig> enabling the plant to cope with toxic effects caused by salt stress.
