BACKGROUND
stress response in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae involves the detection of adverse conditions , activation of signal transduction pathways, and transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation, resulting in the accumulation of protective agents and repairing activities  <cit> . all these mechanisms are intended to allow yeast cells to adapt to environmental changes.

under several different stress conditions, s. cerevisiae displays a common response, the so-called environmental stress response , characterized by changes in the expression of approximately  <dig> genes  <cit> . most of these genes contain the aggg consensus sequence in their promoter  <cit> , which is recognized by transcription factors msn2p and msn4p  <cit> . the activity of these factors is regulated by two pathways that control cell growth: protein kinase a  and target of rapamycin .

besides this general response, yeast cells display specific mechanisms to resist particular adverse conditions. in the case of hyperosmotic stress, produced by a high concentration of salt, sorbitol, glucose or of any other osmolyte, the response is mediated by the high osmolarity glycerol  pathway. high osmolarity is detected by osmosensors located in the membrane, that activate map quinases which, finally, permit the phosphorylation of mapk hog1p, which results in its translocation to the nucleus. once inside this compartment, hog1p activates several transcription factors   <cit> . these factors determine an induction in the expression of about 10% of the yeast genes under conditions of stress caused by high salt or sorbitol concentrations  <cit> . one of the consequences of these changes in gene expression is an increase in the intracellular concentration of glycerol, the osmolyte that yeast cells produce to counteract hyperosmotic stress.

one of the conditions of hyperosmotic stress that can affect yeast cells in particular environments  is that produced by sugar concentrations of 20%  or even higher. several transcriptomic analyses have been carried out to understand the particularities of the response to this form of stress  <cit> . all these studies have indicated that three groups of genes display higher expression levels under these conditions: i) genes involved in glycerol metabolism, ii) genes participating in response to chemical stimulus, and iii) several genes of unknown function. one of them, yhr087w, is induced approximately  <dig> times under 20% glucose and encodes for a protein of  <dig> amino acids . the expression of this gene also increases under other hyperosmotic stress conditions  and in response to other adverse conditions such as heat shock, oxidative damage produced by h2o <dig> or diamide, ethanol, acid or basic phs and the stationary phase  <cit> . the increase in the yhr087w mrna levels under 20% glucose is also followed by higher content of the corresponding protein  <cit> .

some of the data obtained in recent years have demonstrated the relevance of the yhr087w gene expression in the response to high sugar concentrations. on the one hand, its overexpression in wine yeast strains results in an improved stress response and fermentative behavior  <cit> . besides, strains with a high resistance to osmotic stress show higher mrna levels corresponding to this gene  <cit> . finally in laboratory strains, its disruption results in growth delay, lower viability and reduced glucose consumption under 25% and 30% glucose concentrations  <cit> .

from the structural point of view, yhr087wp presents a strong homology with the protein family related with human sbds  <cit> . sbds is the human protein whose mutation provokes the shwachman-bodian-diamond syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder with clinical features, including haematological dysfunction, pankreatic exocrine insufficiency and skeletal abnormalities, as well as a significant predisposition to the development of myelodysplasia and leukemia  <cit> . the yeast orthologue of sbds is sdo1p  <cit> . yhr087wp contains the same structural elements as sdo1p in the n-terminus region and, according to sequence analyses  <cit> , they are distant homologues.

sdo1p binds rna, interacts with nuclear rrna-processing factors  <cit> , and is involved in the maturation of the ribosomal 60 s subunit required for the translational activation of ribosomes  <cit> . there is a report describing an aberrant regulation of btn1p in the absence of sdo1p, which suggests that portions of the ribosome maturation pathways survey the vacuolar function, presumably as a means to adjust protein levels for optimal cellular homeostasis  <cit> . due to the structural relationship between yhr087wp and sdo1p, it has been proposed that the role of that protein in yeast cells would be associated in some way with the rna metabolism  <cit> . actually, synthetic lethality has been described between yhr087w and the mutants in genes encoding proteins involved in rna processing and transport, translation and posttranslational processes .

however, the data found by other authors suggest that yhr087wp could be involved in other cellular processes. the yhr087w gene has also been named rtc <dig>  because its null mutant suppresses the phenotype of termosensitive mutant cdc13- <dig> <cit> . in this mutant, at the non-permissive temperature, telomeric dna is degraded and cell cycle progression is impaired. on the other hand, costanzo et al.  <cit>  described genetic interactions between yhr087w and several genes encoding proteins related with transcription and its control, such as nut1p , set3p , npl3p , cna1p  or bcy1p . finally, the results of a recent proteomic comparison made in our laboratory between deletion mutant Δyhr087w and its corresponding wild type strain  <cit>  under 20% glucose showed lower levels of two proteins involved in protein folding  in the mutant strain, which appeared as an overrepresented category. in this sense, genetic interactions have been described between yhr087w and hsp <dig> <cit> .

in this work we carry out several experiments in order to gain more insights into the role of yhr087wp in yeast cells. the data obtained confirms once more the relationship between this protein and the stress response, provides new information about its transcriptional regulation, and points to a role in translation under adverse growth conditions.

RESULTS
yhr087wp is distributed throughout the cell
data from a global study of protein localization by gfp fusions  <cit>  indicate that protein yhr087wp is distributed throughout the cell.

in order to verify this information and to determine whether the subcellular localization could be affected in some way when yeast cells are subjected to hyperosmotic stress conditions due to high glucose, a gfp tag was introduced into the chromosomal copy of gene yhr087w in the 3' coding region.

the fluorescence microscopy analysis of the exponentially growing cells  showed that yhr087wp is located in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and that this location is not affected by changes in glucose concentration. nonetheless, as previously described  <cit> , an important increase in protein levels takes place when cells are transferred to sc 20% glucose. this increase is particularly important after 30 min.

yhr087w is differentially regulated by transcription factors msn2/4p and hot1p depending on the stress conditions considered
according to the microarray analyses carried out by capaldi et al.  <cit> , the increased expression of yhr087w under several conditions of osmotic stress is regulated through the hog pathway. as this pathway is also involved in the response to high osmolarity due to 20% glucose  <cit>  we determined if under this stress condition hog <dig> controls yhr087w expression. for this purpose, cells exponentially growing in ypd medium from the strains described in additional file 1: table s <dig> tm <dig>  and tm <dig>  were incubated for 30 min in yp <dig>  rna levels of gene yhr087w were determined by northern analysis using a probe resulting from the amplification of genomic dna by oligonucleotides yhr087w- <dig> and yhr087w- <dig> . as shown in figure 2yhr087w mrna levels increase when cells are incubated for 30 min in growth medium containing 20% glucose , but the expression of the gene in the mutant is about ten times lower than in the wild type strain under these conditions , thus demonstrating a role of the hog pathway in the control of the transcription of this gene also when high glucose is used as an osmolyte.

the msn2/4p transcription factors involved in the general stress response are activated by the hog pathway under osmotic stress conditions. an analysis of the yhr087w sequence indicates the presence of stre elements at positions - <dig> and - <dig>  which could be recognized by these proteins. besides, msn2/4p proteins have been reported to be involved in the control of the yhr087w expression under certain conditions, such as zymolyase-induced cell wall stress  <cit> , weak acid stress  <cit>  and hyperosmolarity caused by high kcl concentrations  <cit> . to determine whether or not induction of yhr087w under high glucose concentrations follows the same pattern, rna samples were obtained from exponentially growing cultures in ypd affected or not by 20% glucose or heat shock. these experiments were carried out with mutant strains in several of the transcription factors involved in the response to osmotic stress  using in each case its corresponding wild type strain as reference. as seen in figure  <dig> panel a, the induction of this gene under heat shock occurs in all the wild type strains considered, and is only drastically reduced  in the Δmsn <dig>  mutant. however, under high glucose stress conditions, although the induction is also detected in all the wild type strains used in this analysis  the factors mainly involved in the regulation of the expression of this gene are sko1p, and particularly hot1p, being the reduction in the expression to about 40% and 20% respectively when compared to the reference strains .

chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments carried out with a wild type strain and its corresponding Δhog <dig> mutant both containing a hot1-tap tagged version  indicate that hot1p binds to a region of the yhr087w gene promoter located between positions - <dig> and - <dig> under high glucose stress conditions and that this interaction depends on the presence of hog1p. accordingly, the involvement of hot1p in the regulation of yhr087w expression under 20% glucose is similar to that found for other osmostress-induced genes, such us ctt1hsp <dig> and stl <dig>  with exposure to nacl  <dig>  m  <cit> . similar experiments have been carried out with the corresponding strains containing a sko1p-tap tagged version  and demonstrate that this transcription factor also binds to the region considered of yhr087w promoter in a hog1p dependent manner.

role of yhr087wp in transcription and its control
costanzo et al.  <cit>  created a genome-scale genetic interaction map by examining  <dig>  million gene-gene pairs for synthetic genetic interactions. with this approach, these authors described the interactions between yhr087w and several genes related to transcription and its control, such as bcy1cna1nut1set <dig>  and npl <dig>  in order to corroborate these interactions and to determine their relevance, growth of serial dilutions of yeast cells in ypd solid medium at 37°c, or containing 30% glucose, was determined. this glucose concentration was selected according to previous data obtained in our laboratory  <cit>  and to the results shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  which indicate that a growth defect occurs in strain Δyhr087w at this glucose concentration, which can be followed by growth in such plates. for these experiments, we focused on the determination of the relationship between yhr087w and bcy <dig>  and cna <dig> . for this purpose yhr087w disruption was carried out in mutant strains in all of those genes.

regarding gene cna <dig>  it was not possible to detect any genetic relationship under 37°c or at a high glucose concentration , maybe because of the different growth conditions  used in this work in order to get high expression of gene yhr087w. however, with gene bcy <dig>  a partial supression of its growth defects at 37°c was detected in the double mutant with Δyhr087w. as shown in figure  <dig>  a double mutant grows better than the Δbcy <dig> single mutant at 37°c. despite this interaction, the yhr087w expression is not affected in the Δbcy <dig> mutant strain under heat shock stress or at high glucose concentrations . being bcy1p the regulatory subunit of pka, this result reinforces the yhr087wp’s involvement in the stress response.

the genetic interactions commented above suggest that this protein could indeed play some direct role in transcription. chip analyses were carried out to test the possible binding of yhr087wp to dna, particularly to the stress-induced gene hsp <dig>  for this purpose, a short incubation at 37°c, or under 20%  glucose, was applied to the exponentially growing cells carrying fusion protein yhr087w-tap, created by genetic manipulation in the chromosomal copy of gene yhr087w, as described in the materials and methods section. the results indicate that yhr087wp does not bind to any of the regions considered in hsp <dig> dna under any of the study conditions because the absolute values are very similar to those found under the same conditions with a non labeled strain used as a negative control . additional chip experiments described in the materials and methods section indicated that the binding of the rna polymerase ii to hsp <dig> promoter is not affected in the Δyhr087w mutant .

yhr087wp interacts with proteins involved in stress response and ribosomal function
of the various experimental methods available for identifying protein-protein interactions, this work considers the tandem affinity purification  of tap-tagged yhr087p expressed from its natural chromosome location  to carry out a study on this protein.

in the global analysis of the protein complexes developed a few years ago by krogan et al.  <cit> , yhr087wp appeared to physically interact with eki1p  and suc2p . an interaction with ribosomal protein rpp0p was previously described  <cit> . as these data were obtained under non stress growth conditions, a tap purification experiment was carried out after a 90-min incubation in yp <dig> of ypd-growing cells. previous experiments carried out in our group  <cit>  indicated that protein levels significantly increased under this condition when compared to control growth.

the analysis showed  <dig> proteins with the mascot software  that fulfill the conditions so they could be considered candidates for the interaction with yhr087wp, whereas this number rose to  <dig> when the protein pilot software , version  <dig>  was used. after excluding from the analysis the proteins that appear with a high frequency in successful protein purifications with this procedure  a total of  <dig> proteins, that are coincident in both tests, were finally considered  to be potential yhr087wp-interacting proteins. most of the proteins identified belong to two categories: stress response and translation. actually, according to the funcassociate tool  two statistically significant categories emerge: calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity  and eukaryotic translation 4f complex initiation factor . these results demonstrate once again the relationship between yhr087wp and stress response. besides, the detection of interactions with factors involved in translation initiation  suggests a putative role for the ribosomal function.

 the description according to saccharomyces genome database  is shown.

the co-immunoprecipitation experiments carried out with those strains carrying the tap-tagged version of yhr087wp and an ha-tagged version of sti1p, tif4631p, cdc33p or tif32p confirm the interactions found with the standard tap protocol . as this figure depicts, these proteins appear in the retained fraction after precipitation of the tap-tagged protein with the α-pap antibody.

ribosome isolation experiments and detection of yhr087wp protein location by western blot have indicated that this protein is found, at least partially, in the ribosomal fraction . in these experiments, two control proteins were considered: α subunit of tubulin, which is completely found in the non ribosomal fraction, and the ribosomal protein rpl5p, mainly detected in the ribosomes.

the yhr087w deletion mutant shows an increased sensitivity to translation inhibitors
the tap experiment results suggest the possible implication of yhr087wp in the ribosomal function. to gain more evidences about this hypothesis, sensitivity to translation inhibitors was determined in the deletion mutant of the coding gene. two drugs were considered for this purpose: cycloheximide  and hygromycin . these inhibitors were tested not only with this strain, but also with mutants in sti <dig> and in genes encoding the proteins involved in translation which appeared as candidates for the interaction with yhr087wp according to the tap analysis. besides, double mutant strains with each one of these genes and yhr087w were obtained as described in the materials and methods section and were considered for this analysis.

as figure 7a shows, the mutants in the genes somehow related with the ribosomal function display sensitivity to one and/or another drug. with Δscp <dig>  high sensitivity to cycloheximide was found, while growth was affected to a lesser extent by the presence of hygromycin. Δtif <dig> displayed total lack of growth in hygromycin, and very pronounced growth defects in cycloheximide. growth in the presence of these drugs was not affected, however, by the deletion of the gene sti <dig>  which does not participate in translation. with the Δyhr087w mutant, sensitivity to cycloheximide was greater than to hygromycin. the opossite result was described for mutants in sdo <dig> such as sdo1-k118a  <cit> . the introduction of the yhr087w deletion into these backgrounds did not result in enhanced or disminished sensitivity to the inhibitors tested.

experiments were also carried out with thermosensitive mutants in tif <dig> and in cdc <dig> and the corresponding double mutants with Δyhr087w. in the case of tif32ts no sensitivity was detected to the inhibitors under the conditions considered and no additional effect was displayed by the double mutant . for cdc33ts, as can be seen in figure  <dig>  the sensitivity to hygromycin of the single mutant in translation initiation factor eif4e when incubated at the non permissive temperature at a concentration of 10 μg/ml increased in the double mutant with Δyhr087w. for a more accurate determination of the differences between these single and double mutants, the number of colony forming units and the viability under this concentration of hygromycin were determined . the data obtained confirms the results of the serial dilution analysis and indicates that the variations between strains are statistically significant. it is worth mentioning that similar experiments were also carried out in plates contatining 20 μg/ml of hygromycin; in this case the viability was very low being four times lower in the double mutant than in the single cdc33ts .

dilutions from cultures in exponential phase of growth were plated on ypd or ypd + hygromycin 10 μg/ml plates and the colony forming units appeared 48- <dig> hours later were counted. viability was determined as the percentage between the cfu in hygromycin plates and in ypd plates. application of the t-test to the data obtained for cdc33ts and Δyhr087w cdc33ts mutant strains gave a p value  of  <dig> .

the sensitivity to cycloheximide of the Δyhr087w mutant and the interaction between cdc33p and yhr087wp provide new insights about the role of this protein in translation.

translation recovery after osmotic stress due to high glucose concentrations is slightly affected in the Δyhr087w mutant
the separation of the fractions of the translation complexes associated with mrnas by sucrose gradients is a powerful methodology to study of global protein synthesis and the physiological functions of the individual factors involved in this process  <cit> . the analysis of the polysome profiles has also shown that when yeast cells are affected by high salinity stress, a temporary shutdown of translation in short times occurs, followed by a subsequent recovery in time  <cit> .

to determine whether increased sensitivity to the translation inhibitors detected in strain Δyhr087w is associated with defects in this process, we analyzed the polysome profiles of this mutant and the corresponding wild type strain. for these experiments, the exponentially growing cultures of these strains were transferred to an od <dig> of  <dig>  to yp <dig>  samples were collected at different times to analyze the changes in the translational activity noted during the first minutes of incubation under 20% glucose, as well as the effect of the mutation in gene yhr087w. the time  <dig> sample was obtained before the transfer to the high glucose concentration medium took place.

figures 8a and b show the polysome profiles obtained in these experiments. in order to gain a better understanding of the information provided by our analyses, table  <dig> presents the percentage of area corresponding to the polysomal fraction in the profiles. from these data, it is possible to determine the relationship between the polysome area  under stress  and under normal growth conditions . this parameter represents the relative change in mrna associated with the ribosomes participating presumably in translation  <cit> . the values in table  <dig> also allow us to determine the relationship between the nonpolysomal  fraction under both conditions , which represents the relative change in mrna that is not translated. if we consider all these data, it is possible to estimate the percentage of translation, determined as the relationship of the polysomal fraction between a particular timepoint compared to the time of the stress application .

 the data shown correspond to the percentage of the polysome area relative to the total area of polysomal plus free plus monosomal fractions. the amount of rrna in each fraction was measured by uv detection at 260 nm. three independent experiments were carried out: average and standard deviation are shown.

 ratio between the area of the polysomal and free plus monosomal fractions.

 ratio between the area corresponding to the 60 s and 40 s subunits.

as shown in figure 8a, the introduction of osmotic stress due to high glucose concentration determines a similar effect in the wild type yeast cells to that described for 1 m nacl by melamed et al.  <cit> . translation markedly lowers during the first minutes, which can be clearly detected at 15 min. at this time, the translation rate drops almost a half , and the ps/pn ratio is  <dig> , while the fms/fmn ratio shows a value of  <dig> . melamed et al.  <cit>  revealed descreases in the polysomal fraction, which are higher for 1 m nacl . thirty min after applying the high glucose concentration, the wild type strain is capable to recover around 84% of the initial level of translation, and the situation is very similar to that before applying stress  after 45 min, suggesting that the translational effect of this kind of osmotic stress is lower than that provoked by high salinity .

for strain Δyhr087w, a slightly higher decrease in translation was noted at 15 min after introducing the high sugar stress, with values for the ps/pn and fms/fmn ratios of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. besides, as shown in figure 8b for the  <dig> and 45 min timepoints, the recovery of translation shows a delay when compared to the wild type strain . after  <dig> minutes, this strain had already recovered the initial levels of translation.

although the differences between mutant and wild type strains are low, they are statistically significant at time points  <dig>   <dig> and, particularly, 45 min, which provides another result that points to an involvement of yhr087wp in the ribosomal function. unlike the results described for the sdo <dig> mutants  <cit> , this role would not seem to be related to the maturation of the 60 s subunit, as the ratio of the areas corresponding to 60 s/40 s fractions  does not consistently decrease in mutant Δyhr087w.

the translation of several mrnas is affected in the Δyhr087w deletion mutant under high glucose stress conditions
according to the results of a proteomic analysis  <cit> , levels of several proteins  in the Δyhr087w deletion mutant are lowered at the 20% glucose concentration. additional file 2: figure s <dig> confirms these results and indicates that the amount of this protein did not increase at 1 h after applying high glucose stress to exponential cultures of this mutant. these differences in protein levels cannot be explained by transcriptional control because the hsp <dig> mrna levels  under this stress condition, determined by real-time rt-pcr, are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

the slightly lower translation recovery found in the Δyhr087w mutant strain after applying the high glucose stress prompted us to determine if the distribution of hsp <dig> mrna between the polysomal and monosomal fractions could be affected in this strain. as shown in figure  <dig>  the p/fm ratio, is  <dig>  times lower in the Δyhr087w mutant than in the corresponding wild type strain at 45 min after applying the adverse condition. this difference is in the threshold to be considered statistically significant , is consistently found in all the replicates of the experiment and could explain the differences noted in the hsp104p levels between these two strains in the proteomic and western blot analyses. this difference in mrna translation is more clear and significant from the statistical point of view in the case of genes coding for the proteins involved in the stress response hsp <dig>  and, particularly, gpd <dig> .

yhr087wp has homologues in other yeasts
the application of the blastp tool has allowed the identification of yhr087wp homologous proteins in many yeasts and fungi . so far little is known about these proteins and their role, but global transcription analyses carried out in schizosaccharomyces pombe <cit>  have shown that the ortholog in this microorganism  is induced also by several stress conditions, including osmotic stress , heat shock , and oxidative injuries .

1blastp <dig> . <dig> was used for the search  <cit> . data show only the homologue proteins with e-values lower than exp- <dig> from a total of  <dig> blast hits. all the non-redundant genbank cds translations + pdb + swissprot + pir + prf, excluding the environmental samples from wgs projects, were considered.

the sequence alignment among some of these homologue proteins  shows four particularly conserved regions located between positions 30- <dig>  63- <dig>  80- <dig> and 102- <dig>  residues k <dig>  v <dig>  v <dig>  v <dig>  f <dig>  a <dig>  v <dig>  f <dig>  g <dig>  e <dig>  v <dig>  t <dig>  l <dig> and g <dig> are identical or conserved with sbds proteins  <cit> .

discussion
in this work we carry out a functional analysis of gene yhr087w. to date this gene has been related to many different cellular processes, and determining its main role in yeast cells is proving to be a difficult task. the results previously obtained in our laboratory indicate an involvement of yhr087wp in the osmotic stress caused by high glucose concentrations, although the gene expression data published by other authors suggest that it may also participate in the response to other forms of stress  <cit> . the link between yhr087wp and response to stress  is based on the following aspects: i) deletion of the coding gene results in a lower growth rate in the presence of 25% and 30% glucose concentrations  <cit>  ii) wine yeast strains displaying better tolerance to osmotic stress have high levels of the mrna of this gene  <cit> ; iii) its overexpression improves the osmotic stress resistance and fermentative behavior of these strains  <cit> ; iv) the proteomic study carried out with the Δyhr087w deletion mutant  <cit>  provides a strong link between the levels of this gene expression under high glucose concentrations and the hsp104p and hsp78p levels; v) genetic interactions between yhr087w and hsp <dig>  another gene encoding an hsp protein  <cit>  have been described. this work demonstrates another interesting interaction which was previously suggested by constanzo et al.  <cit> : Δyhr087w is capable of partially suppressing the growth defects displayed by the Δbcy <dig> mutant at 37°c. as bcy1p encodes the regulatory subunit of protein kinase a, involved in the control of cell growth and stress response, the connection of yhr087p with this process becomes more evident.

on the other hand, results shown in figure  <dig> demonstrate that the expression of yhr087w is controlled mainly by msn2/4p transcription factors under heat shock, and by hot1p and sko1p  when osmotic stress due to high glucose concentration is applied. this differential regulation depending on the stress conditions could be explained by inhibition under 20% glucose of msn2/ <dig> activity and hence by an overall decrease in the activation of the general stress response in these conditions, according to capaldi et al.  <cit> .

once the relationship between yhr087wp and stress response is established, the question posed would be how this protein is involved in it and why is there a lower expression of several stress response proteins in this mutant. one possibility is that it would develop some transcriptional  or posttranscriptional  role. this could explain the described genetic interactions with mdm20p/nat3p, nsr1p, npl3p, yra2p and air1p  <cit> . however, the transcriptomic experiments carried out in our laboratory  indicate a very low number of genes that are transcriptionally affected in the Δyhr087w mutant  and they cannot be included in any statistically significant category. besides, other studies also carried out by our group indicate that yhr087wp is not involved in the mrna export , the binding to yeast promoters , the recruitment of rna polymerase ii to them or the stability of the messengers .

the results obtained in the tap experiments described in this work seem to assign a protein translation-related function to yhr087wp. the physical interactions found in these experiments with several of the factors involved in translation , its partial association with the ribosomal fraction , the fact that the deletion mutant displays lower levels of proteins associated with ribosomal function  <cit> , and the genetic interactions noted in this work  with the gene encoding translation initiation factor eif4e  and those described by other authors with nat3p and nsr1p  <cit> , all support this potential role of the protein. it is worth mentioning that many other proteins relating to the ribosome structure and function were also detected in the tap experiments, but they were not considered because they can be found in more than 3% of the successful protein purifications when this method is followed  <cit> .

the experimental approach chosen to assess the role of this protein in ribosomal function also aimed to test whether a functional relationship with sdo1p could be found, given the great structural similarity between these two proteins. the yhr087wp protein shares with sdo1p -and with other members of the family of proteins related to human sbds- the fish domain, characterized by a specific and highly-defined secondary structure:  <dig> β -  <dig> α - β - 2α. prediction studies of the secondary and three-dimensional structure conducted by several authors  <cit>  reveal that yhr087wp is very similar to the nt region of sdo1p, where this domain is located. in evolutionary terms, yhr087wp and sdo1p have been proposed to have a relationship of a distant homology, and must result from a divergent evolution process  <cit> . the results presented in this work  indicate that, although sdo1p is involved in translation and yhr087wp could participate in this process, each one of these proteins would have its particular role in it, being that of yhr087wp related with stress response. actually sdo1p is not regulated by adverse growth conditions  <cit> .

our studies done to determine the relationship of yhr087wp with the ribosomal function provide some interesting results. on the one hand, the deletion mutant shows sensitivity to cycloheximide , which also occurs in the mutants in proteins scp <dig> and tif4631p , both of which interact with yhr087wp and have an unambiguous role in translation. on the other hand, the polysome profiles show that the Δyhr087w mutant is slightly more affected in translation activity than the wild type strain when high glucose osmotic stress is applied to exponentially growing cells. it is worth mentioning that our results indicate that the repression of translational activity described by melamed et al.  <cit>  under high salinity conditions also occurs with an osmotic stress due to 20% glucose, although during a shorter time.

the translation defect found in mutant Δyhr087w under 20% glucose does not result in a reduced translation of all the mrnas and maybe for this reason the overall effect is low. instead, some specific mrnas involved in the stress response, such as those corresponding to hsp104hsp <dig> and gpd <dig>  are affected. it is noteworthy that the levels of translation of the ipp <dig> or pda <dig> mrnas  are similar in both the wild type and mutant strains. on the other hand, our analyses also included ygr052w and yjl107c, two genes induced by osmotic stress  <cit> . in this case, and at the time considered, the p/fm ratio was higher in the mutant strain. the differences found with the other contemplated stress-related genes could be due to the function developed  or to the kinetic variations in the p/fm ratio during the translation recovery to the applied osmotic stress. it is important also to note that the cdna levels corresponding to these genes are lower under the tested conditions than those found for the others considered.

the lower polysomal/free plus monosomal ratio found for the hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> mrnas in the mutant strain, if compared with the wild type, is consistent with the lower levels encountered for these proteins  and with previous proteomic analyses  <cit> . moreover, it can explain, together with the results found for gpd <dig>  the growth defects displayed by that strain under high glucose stress  <cit> . the relationship found for yhr087wp between a role in translation recovery after osmotic stress treatment and loss of viability and growth reduction in its mutant strain has been recently observed for cbc1p, which encodes the nuclear cap-binding protein  <cit> . nevertheless, elucidating the particular role of each one of these proteins in translation recovery will require further analyses. the detection of the protein homologues of protein yhr087wp in fungi  suggests that this protein peforms a relevant role, particularly in stress response according to the data available from schizosaccharomyces pombe <cit> . taking into account the function of yhr087wp in the response to high sugar concentrations and the high mrna levels found under these conditions we propose hgi <dig>  as a possible name to design the encoding gene in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
our results lead us to several conclusions:  yhr087wp protein is distributed throughout the cell, independently of the growth conditions, and is partially found in the ribosomal fractions.  the expression of the coding gene is controlled by the transcription factors msn2/4p, sko1p and hot1p in a way depending on the stress conditions considered, being particularly highly relevant the latter in the response to high glucose conditions.  several experiments carried out in this work provide new insights about the involvement of this protein in the response to stress: it interacts with cmk1/2p and sti1p and displays a genetic relationship with the bcy1p subunit of the pka.  according to tap experiments, it also interacts with several proteins participating in translation, including translation factors eif4e and eif4g. this result and the increased sensitivity of the deletion mutant strain to translation inhibitors points to a role of this protein in translation.  under conditions of high glucose stress the translation recovery is quicker than when high salinity is applied. this recovery shows a certain delay in the Δyhr087w strain.  the ratio between the association to polysomal and free and monosomal fractions of mrnas corresponding to several stress response genes  is reduced in the deletion mutant when compared with the wild type strain after the application of high sugar stress which indicates that the lower levels of some stress proteins in the mutant strain might be due to defects in their translation, and provides a possible explanation for the lower osmotic stress resistance described for this strain. the existence of homologues in other yeasts and fungi reinforces the relevance of this protein.

yeast strains, growth conditions and genetic methods
all the s. cerevisiae strains used for these experiments are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  growth of yeast strains without auxotrophies was carried out in ypd medium  yeast extract, 2%  bactopeptone, 2%  glucose) at 30°c with orbital shaking . strains with auxotrophies were grown in sc medium  nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulphate,  <dig> %  2so <dig>   <dig> %  drop out mix without the selected amino acid or nucleobase, 2%  glucose). the solid medium also contained 2%  agar. in most experiments, liquid cultures were kept in the exponential growth phase for 16-24 h; then cells were treated under the required conditions; in the case of osmotic stress by high glucose concentration, cells were collected and transferred from ypd to the same medium containing 20%  glucose .

for the growth assays on resistance to osmotic stress or antibiotics, yeast cultures were diluted to the same od <dig>  and serial dilutions  were spotted onto ypd-derived plates, which were incubated at the desired temperatures. for the osmotic stress analyses plates contained 20%, 25% or 30%  glucose  or 1 m kcl. ypd plates with cycloheximide  or hygromycin  were used for antibiotic resistance purposes. in some experiments, for a more accurate determination of the differences between strains, colony forming units were counted after application on the plates of the appropriate volumes and dilutions.

to construct yhr087w deletion strains, the wild-type coding sequence was replaced with the ura <dig> gene through amplification of a disruption cassette from the yep <dig> plasmid with oligonucleotides delw-a and delw-b  and yeast transformation  <cit> . a similar procedure was used for hog <dig> gene deletion, with the utilization of the oligonucleotides delhog-a and del-hog-b. the yhr087w gene was tagged with gfp in the fy <dig> strain using the longtine method  <cit> ; for this purpose, oligonucleotides yhr087w-f <dig> and yhr087w-r <dig>  were used to amplify the transformation cassette from the pfa6a-gfp-kanmx <dig> plasmid. to introduce the tap tag into the same gene in strain fy <dig>  a pcr amplification was carried out on the pbs <dig> plasmid with oligonucleotides yhr087w-tap l and yhr087w-tap r. in the derived strain and in the corresponding wild type strain, genes tif <dig>  cdc <dig>  sti <dig> and tif <dig> were independently tagged with ha. for this purpose oligonucleotides tif32-f <dig>  tif32-r <dig>  cdc33-f <dig>  cdc33-r <dig>  sti-f <dig>  sti-r <dig> and tif4631-f <dig> and tif4631-r <dig>  were used to amplify the transformation cassette from the pfa6a-3ha-his3mx <dig> plasmid  <cit> . detection of hsp104p in western analyses was possible for the introduction of a ha tag by means of the primers hsp-f <dig> and hsp-r <dig>  selection of transformants by antibiotic resistance was achieved in ypd plates containing geneticin at a final concentration of 100 mg/l. selection of transformants by auxotrophy was followed in sc medium plates without the corresponding amino acid or nucleobase.
