BACKGROUND
following the  <dig> earthquake in haiti, a cholera outbreak began in haiti’s artibonite department and rapidly spread across the country. as of march  <dig>   <dig>  a total of  <dig>  cholera cases have been reported in haiti, with  <dig> deaths due to the epidemic . cholera cases were also reported in the dominican republic  <cit> , and cases linked to the outbreak strain have been documented in travelers returning to their home countries from both haiti and the dominican republic  <cit> .

the absence of a previously recorded history of epidemic cholera in haiti  <cit>  raised interest in understanding the source of this outbreak. in order to further characterize the haitian cholera strain, initial studies applied pulsed field gel electrophoresis and variable number tandem repeat typing to a large number of microbial isolates from the haitian cholera outbreak  <cit> . these analyses identified the haitian cholera strain as v. cholerae o <dig> el tor, placing it as a seventh pandemic strain. in general, these studies found low levels of genetic variation in isolates, supporting a point-source origin for the outbreak  <cit> .

more than a year has elapsed since v. cholerae was first introduced into haiti. identifying novel microbial variants that have emerged over the course of the outbreak may provide insight into the organism’s evolution on a short time scale. genomic sequencing is the most powerful approach for evaluating such microbial evolution. next-generation sequencing technologies, including illumina, pacbio, and  <dig> sequencing, have increased the speed and decreased the cost of genome-wide sequencing. chin et al. sequenced two v. cholerae isolates from haiti using pacbio sequencing, which produces longer reads but has a higher error rate than other next-generation approaches  <cit> . reimer et al. used single-end illumina-based sequencing to sequence eight v. cholerae isolates from haiti and one from the dominican republic  <cit> . hendriksen et al. compared haitian v. cholerae sequences to sequences from nepal, finding that the haitian isolates are highly similar to a set of isolates collected in nepal in the summer of  <dig>  <cit> . these sequencing studies indicated that the haitian epidemic is most closely related to seventh pandemic strains from south asia, and that the dominican republic outbreak strain is genetically nearly identical to the haitian outbreak strain. the recent study of hasan et al.  <cit>  identified non-o1/o <dig> v. cholerae strains in patients in haiti, and additional work is needed to explore the potential contribution of such strains to disease in haiti.

in this study, we used paired-end illumina sequencing at a high depth of coverage to sequence one v. cholerae isolate from the dominican republic, three isolates from haiti, and three additional v. cholerae isolates. four of the isolates were previously sequenced using a variety of sequencing technologies  <cit> , and we present a comparison between sequence data generated using sanger-based, next-generation, and pacbio sequencing technologies. the sequenced isolates include a classical o1-serogroup isolate from the sixth pandemic and an o139-serogroup strain as well as o <dig> el tor strains from the seventh pandemic. the diverse strains sequenced and the high depth of coverage allow us to probe the sequence coverage required for optimal assembly and variant calling of the v. cholerae genome using next generation sequencing. our data characterize the depth of coverage needed to accurately resolve sequence variation between v. cholerae strains.

we further identify sequence differences between the haitian and dominican republic isolates in comparison to previously published and newly sequenced worldwide samples, and in comparison to each other. the three isolates from haiti were collected in the same hospital in the artibonite department in october,  <dig>  the dominican republic isolate was collected three months later, in connection with a cholera outbreak among guests returning from a wedding in the dominican republic  <cit> . since epidemic cholera had not been reported in hispaniola prior to  <dig>  examining microbial mutations as the outbreak spread from haiti to the dominican republic three months later provides insight into the temporal evolution of epidemic v. cholerae.

RESULTS
sequencing seven v. cholerae isolates at high depth of coverage
we sequenced seven v. cholerae isolates, including three isolates from haiti , one from the dominican republic , two from bangladesh , and one from india . four of these isolates  were previously sequenced using a variety of sequencing technologies and to varying depths, and are denoted with an asterisk. we sequenced all strains to high depths of coverage . we have deposited the sequence data in the sequence read archive database .

effect of depth of coverage on genome assembly and single-nucleotide polymorphism  calling
the high depth of coverage of our sequencing enabled comparison of the efficacy of de novo assembly and variant detection at multiple depths of coverage. to assess the assembly quality, we used the n <dig> statistic. n <dig>  a common metric of assembly quality, is the number of base pairs in the longest contig c such that fewer than half of the base pairs in the genome lie in contigs that are longer than c. we selected a random sample of the total reads for each isolate and compared the median n <dig> value for assemblies produced by velvet at a range of coverage depths , with three random read samples at each depth of coverage. for most isolates, n <dig> is stable across the range of depths from 50x to 250x, suggesting that 50x coverage is sufficient to construct a de novo assembly for these samples . however, n <dig> continues to increase up to 100x coverage in sample h1*. the average read quality in h1* is the lowest of all the samples , suggesting that while 50x is sufficient depth of coverage for de novo genome assembly on most samples, greater coverage is needed when average base quality is low.

we explored the effect of depth of coverage on calling sequence variants by examining the snps, insertions, and deletions identified at a range of coverage depths . for all isolates, the number of snps identified increases sharply up to 50x coverage, and continues to increase gradually after this point . in six of the seven isolates, at least 85% of the snps identified at 250x coverage are also identified at 50x coverage . snps identified uniquely at higher depths of coverage include variants in regions where the average base quality is low, regions with unusually low depths of coverage compared to the rest of the genome, and regions with false positive calls due to misalignment of reads across a deletion. fifty-fold coverage is also sufficient to identify nearly all of the insertions and deletions observed at higher depths of coverage . at 50x coverage, we detected at least 98% of the insertions and deletions observed at 250x coverage in each isolate. twenty-fold coverage is sufficient to detect the majority of insertions and deletions; at least 90% of insertions and deletions that are observed at 250x coverage are also found at 20x coverage in five of the seven isolates. these results suggest that 50x coverage is sufficient to accurately call most variants, although deeper coverage provides additional power for identifying snps in some genomic regions.

comparison of sequence variants, insertions, and deletions identified using multiple sequencing approaches
four of our isolates were previously sequenced using a variety of platforms. those sequencing results provide an opportunity for us to compare variant calls across sequencing technologies, validate variant calls, and identify potential errors in reference sequences.

comparison to n <dig> sanger reference sequences
the original reference genome for v. cholerae was the sanger-sequenced n <dig> genome  <cit> . feng et al. subsequently identified a number of corrections to the reference based on comparisons to additional strains at ambiguous positions and open reading frame clone sequence data  <cit> . their corrections included  <dig> single base pair differences and  <dig> insertions and deletions. similarly, we identified  <dig> single base pair differences as well as  <dig> insertions and deletions between n16961* and the n <dig> reference  <cit>  .

to validate variant calls where the n16961* sequence differs from the corresponding reference, we examined the positions corresponding to those differences, using the microbial genome browser alignment. positions that differ between the reference sequence and the new isolates may represent errors in the reference sequence, false positive snp calls, or mutations introduced during lab passage of the strains. if the discrepancy is due to an error in the reference sequence, then the sequences of additional strains in the alignment  are likely to agree with our variant call and disagree with the reference . for  <dig> of the  <dig> differences, the alignments to strains o <dig> and mo <dig> support our new calls in n16961* . alignment to the additional strains supports all but one of the  <dig> insertions and deletions identified between n <dig> and n16961*, consistent with the interpretation that the discordant positions correspond to errors in the reference sequence. we combined the corrections to the n <dig> reference sequence previously identified by feng et al.  <cit>  with the validated variants that we identified to generate an updated list of sequence corrections .

comparison to o <dig> sanger and o <dig> abi/ <dig> sequences
to identify positions at which the sequence differed across multiple technologies, we compared the o395* sequence to the o <dig> sanger and abi/454-sequenced references . we detected  <dig> snps between the o395* isolate and the sanger-sequenced reference. blast queries indicated that in closely related strains, the sequence matches the reference at the position of these snps. however, manual examination of the snp positions indicated that they are likely to be real variants, suggesting that they may have been introduced during laboratory passage of the o <dig> isolate . we did not detect any insertions or deletions between the o395* sample and the o <dig> sanger-sequenced reference. between the o395* sequence and the abi/454-sequenced o <dig> reference , we detected seven additional single-base pair differences, four deletions, and one insertion. the accuracy of our illumina calls at nine of these twelve positions is supported by their agreement with the sanger-sequenced reference; for the other three positions, the sanger-sequenced reference agrees with the abi/ <dig> calls.

comparison to pacbio sequences
we compared three of the isolates that we sequenced  to previously published pacbio sequences for these same isolates   <cit> . in the n16961* sample, 83% of the snps that we identified  were also present in the pacbio-based snp calls. we identified ten snps not found in the pacbio variant calls, seven of which are validated by alignment to additional strains. chin et al. reported five snps that we did not detect. four of the five variants identified uniquely in the pacbio-based calls lie in repetitive regions of the genome, and these calls are supported by alignment to additional strains. the remaining snp is not supported by alignment to additional strains. although the majority of single nucleotide variant calls were consistent across platforms, only 55% of our illumina-based insertions and deletions were also found using pacbio sequencing . we identified  <dig> insertions and deletions in the n16961* sample not identified in the pacbio sequencing, and chin et al. reported seven insertions and deletions that we did not recover. only one of the seven insertions and deletions unique to the pacbio sequence is supported by alignment to additional strains, suggesting that the illumina-based sequencing of the n <dig> strain provided more sensitive and specific detection of insertions and deletions than the pacbio-based sequencing.

we also compared the variants identified in the h <dig> and h <dig> isolates relative to the n <dig> reference by pacbio sequencing  with those identified by illumina sequencing  . ninety-five percent  of the snps we identified in h1* were identified in the pacbio sequencing as well, while 83%  of the snps we called in h2* were also called in the pacbio sequencing. thirty-one snps were identified uniquely in the pacbio sequencing of h <dig>  while  <dig> snps were identified uniquely in the pacbio sequencing of h <dig>  many of the variant calls  that were identified only by pacbio sequencing lie in repeat regions of the genome, suggesting that the long pacbio reads may facilitate detection of snps in repetitive regions of the genome that are difficult to recover using the shorter illumina reads. of the insertions and deletions that we identified in h1* and h2*, only 20-30%  were also recovered in the pacbio-based calls. the pacbio-based sequencing identified  <dig> insertions and deletions in h <dig> and  <dig> in h <dig> not found in the illumina-based calls. thus, while both the illumina-based and the pacbio-based sequencing identified similar snps, the insertion and deletion calls were highly divergent between the two approaches.

identifying snps, insertions, deletions, and structural variation across isolates
analysis of an o <dig> serogroup isolate from bangladesh
the o <dig> serogroup isolate from bangladesh  was collected in dhaka in  <dig> and has not been previously sequenced. relative to the n <dig> reference strain, the isolate has deletions in the vpi-ii genomic island, the superintegron, and a region on chromosome  <dig> associated with o antigen synthesis which contains genes involved in lipopolysaccharide and sugar synthesis/modification. the db_ <dig> isolate contains two long regions that are absent from the n <dig> reference. a  <dig> -base pair region in the assembly of db_ <dig> matches a region in an o139-serogroup strain from southern india that encodes genes for o-antigen synthesis . the db_ <dig> assembly also contains an  <dig> -base pair region matching sxt integrative and conjugative element sequences in genbank.

the genomic content of the db_ <dig> isolate is similar to that of other o <dig> serogroup isolates. phylogenetic analysis indicates that db_ <dig> clusters closely with an o <dig> serogroup isolate from india  . the deletions in the superintegron, absence of the vpi- <dig> genomic island, presence of the sxt region, and differences in o antigen genes are characteristic of other o139-serogroup isolates  <cit> .

analysis of dominican republic and haitian isolates
the haitian and dominican republic isolates cluster closely together and group in the phylogenetic tree with other seventh pandemic strains . among the isolates in our phylogeny, the haitian and dominican republic strains cluster most closely with strains from bangladesh . in the alignments used to construct the phylogeny, there are an average of  <dig> substitutions between the newly sequenced haitian/dominican republic isolates and cirs <dig>  and an average of  <dig> substitutions between the haitian/dominican republic isolates and mj- <dig> 

to further characterize the haitian and dominican republic isolates, we identified deletions and copy number variation relative to reference sequences . in all haitian and dominican republic isolates, deletions were observed in the vsp- <dig> and superintegron regions. there are also deletions in the sxt region of the haitian and dominican republic isolates relative to the mj- <dig> reference strain from bangladesh . to identify novel insertions, we aligned a 150x-coverage sample of n16961* reads to the de novo assembly of each dominican republic and haitian isolate. all 1000-base pair windows in the de novo assemblies of the haitian and dominican republic isolates to which n16961* reads did not map matched sxt integrating conjugative element sequences in genbank, suggesting that no additional large insertions are present in the genomes of these isolates.

the four isolates from haiti and the dominican republic are nearly identical in genomic sequence, consistent with a clonal origin for the epidemic. we identified three snps between the haitian and dominican republic isolates, as well as one additional mutation in one of the haitian isolates . no sequence differences were identified between isolates h1* and h <dig>  and no large-scale structural variation was observed across the haitian and dominican republic isolates.

*the two locations provided for the rsta-related mutation correspond to the two copies of this gene in the n <dig> reference strain.

†while all other genomic coordinates in the table are specified with respect to the n <dig> reference strain, this variant lies in the sxt region, absent from the n <dig> reference. here, the genomic coordinates are specified with respect to the mj- <dig> reference.

functional annotation of variants in haitian and dominican republic cholera strains
the four isolates from haiti and the dominican republic  are nearly identical in genomic sequence and share  <dig> variants relative to the n <dig> reference. seventy-three of these variants are non-synonymous mutations in coding genes . notably, a number of the non-synonymous mutations occur in the same gene, or in genes with similar function, potentially indicating adaptive convergence. these include three mutations in the cholera enterotoxin , and two mutations in msha biogenesis proteins , which are involved in bacterial adhesion  <cit> . there are also two mutations that lie in two distinct dna mismatch repair proteins, and two mutations in two outer membrane proteins, ompv and omph.

in order to identify purifying or positive selection between the n <dig> reference and the haitian/dominican republic v. cholerae strains, we simulated random mutations in the cholera genome. to simulate random point mutations, we selected a genomic position uniformly at random, looked up the nucleotide at that position, and then randomly selected one of the three other possible bases at that position. we set the number of mutations equal to the number of differences between the n <dig> reference and the haitian/dominican strains, and repeated the simulation  <dig> times. at each iteration, we identified changes encoding non-synonymous substitutions . when substitutions between each pair of nucleotides occurred with equal probability, synonymous changes were over-represented in the haitian/dominican republic strains relative to the simulated data , suggesting purifying selection. however, with transitions twice as likely as transversions, the enrichment of synonymous changes in the actual sequences relative to the simulation was not significant .

we identified four mutations that occurred within the haitian and dominican republic isolates , one in the sxt region, one in the ctx region, and two in the core genome. three point mutations separated the dominican republic isolate from the haitian isolates. these include a synonymous change in the pyruvate-flavodoxin oxidoreductase gene and a nonsynonymous substitution in transposase in the sxt region of the genome; both were also identified by reimer et al.  <cit> . the third mutation separating the dominican republic and haitian isolates is either within  or upstream  of the rsta gene, in the ctx region of the genome. the mutation upstream of rsta is in a region identified as bound by rstr in a dnase i protection assay  <cit> . we also identified a non-synonymous mutation unique to one of the haitian isolates in the taga-related gene.

CONCLUSIONS
the three haitian isolates, the dominican republic isolate, and the other isolates that we have sequenced provide insight into the changes in v. cholerae over the course of the recent epidemic in hispaniola. we identified four unique snps in individual haitian and dominican republic cholera strains, in comparison to all other haitian and dominican republic strains. one of these mutations is in the sxt region, one is in the ctx region, and two are in the core genome. these mutations include three mutations between the haitian and dominican republic isolates, as well as one mutation unique to a single haitian isolate. our observation of three snps between isolates that are separated by three months is consistent with a recent estimate of an accumulation rate of  <dig>  snps/year in the core v. cholerae genome  <cit> .

the haitian epidemic illustrates the transmission of v. cholerae across geographical boundaries. multiple studies  <cit>  have suggested that the haitian cholera outbreak strain is likely to have originated in south asia, and our analysis supports this conclusion. clinical cases linked to the haitian cholera strain have occurred in the dominican republic and in travelers who have recently visited the region. thus, the use of whole-genome sequencing to trace the evolution of a strain involved in an ongoing outbreak is clinically relevant both for understanding an existing epidemic and for tracking related cases occurring in other regions.

whole-genome sequencing of disease-causing organisms can reveal genetic differences between isolates that may be driven by adaption to new host or environmental factors. one of the mutations we identified between the dominican republic and haitian isolates is in a region reported to be bound by the transcriptional repressor rstr  <cit> , suggesting that this mutation might affect regulation of gene expression. this mutation is located upstream of the rsta gene, which is necessary for replication of the ctx phage genome  <cit> . the mutation in the haitian isolate h2* is located in taga-related protein. taga-related protein is secreted extracellularly by v. cholerae <cit>  and is a homolog of taga, which has mucinase function  <cit> . sequencing of additional isolates from this outbreak over time is likely to provide further clues on the evolutionary dynamics of the v. cholerae genome.

since even a single base pair mutation may have functional significance, accurate and complete detection of sequence variation is important. understanding the effect of technical variables such as sequencing platform and depth of coverage is key to identifying genomic changes over the course of an epidemic. by sequencing to a high depth of coverage and re-sequencing strains that were previously sequenced using a variety of technologies, we were able to compare variant detection across multiple sequencing platforms and depths of coverage. we found that 50-fold coverage is sufficient for genome assembly and for the detection of most sequence variants, although some additional variants are detected at higher coverage depths. the majority of variant calls, insertions, and deletions are identified across the isolates regardless of sequencing technology. however, we also identified a set of sequence variants, insertions, and deletions that were observed uniquely in each platform. the high depth of coverage and low error rate of our illumina sequencing permits accurate detection of sequence variants, insertions, and deletions. the long reads produced by the pacbio technology allows the identification of some additional variants, particularly in repeat regions. as increasing quantities of sequence data become available and new sequencing technologies emerge, further work will be needed to identify the effects of sequencing platform and analysis pipeline on the genome-wide identification of variants.

the increasing speed and decreasing cost of whole-genome sequencing permits the rapid characterization of microbial isolates over the course of an epidemic. whole-genome sequencing can be used to track genomic evolution and functional variation in real time, to identify patterns of disease spread within a region, and to identify the source of an epidemic by tracing relationships to other strains around the world. whole-genome sequencing is a powerful epidemiological tool whose applications towards understanding infectious disease are only beginning to be explored.
