BACKGROUND
dhrs <dig>  the fourth member of the dehydrogenase/reductase  family, is a gene encoding nadp-dependent retinol dehydrogenase/reductase . prior to december of  <dig>  an examination of the dhrs <dig> gene on chromosome 14q <dig>  in genbank revealed that the human dhrs <dig> gene cluster consisted of two genes, dhrs <dig> and dhrs4l <dig>  in  <dig>  we identified the nrdr proteins from rabbit liver tissues, and found that this protein had strong retinol oxidation and retinal reduction activities and was a crucial enzyme in the metabolism and synthesis of retinoic acid  <cit> , an important intracellular signaling molecule involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation of embryonic cells, and the regulation of immune functions. the presence of nrdr in other species was confirmed recently and the enzyme was shown to have similar carbonyl reductase activity but with different substrates  <cit> . in previous studies, we also found the alternative spliced rnas of dhrs <dig> and dhrs4l <dig>  <cit> , and identified exon a <dig> both as a novel exon contained in the rna variants of dhrs4l <dig> and an alternative transcription start site  for dhrs4l <dig>  <cit> . exon a <dig> matches with a special intergene sequence, approximate  <dig> kb upstream of the first exon of dhrs4l <dig> and  <dig> bp downstream of the last exon of dhrs <dig> in the genomic dna.

due to an information update of genbank in december of  <dig>  the gene loc <dig>  located downstream of dhrs <dig> and dhrs4l <dig> and similar to the peroxisomal short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase, was renamed dhrs4l <dig>  the human dhrs <dig> gene cluster is now composed of dhrs <dig>  dhrs4l <dig> and dhrs4l <dig>  to investigate the transcription of dhrs4l <dig> and the transcriptional regulation of dhrs <dig> gene cluster, we cloned the full length rna variants of dhrs4l <dig> in this study, and found that dhrs4l <dig> initiated its transcription from two tss, exon a <dig> and exon  <dig>  exon a <dig> matches with the intergene sequence between dhrs4l <dig> and dhrs4l <dig>  and is homologous to exon a <dig> located upstream of dhrs4l <dig>  through the analysis of the gene structures and transcriptional behaviors of the dhrs <dig> gene cluster, we propose a possible mechanism involving the antisense transcripts from c14orf <dig> and the alternative tss for the transcriptional regulation of the human dhrs <dig> gene cluster.

RESULTS
comparative analysis of the dhrs <dig> gene cluster
in the three copies of the dhrs <dig> gene cluster, dhrs <dig> is common in mammals and aquatic animals, while dhrs4l <dig> is only found in primates and dhrs4l <dig> in humans. humans, therefore, are the only species that contain all three genes in the dhrs <dig> gene cluster. the phylogenic tree of the dhrs <dig> gene cluster across different species  and comparative analysis of the human dhrs <dig> gene cluster  suggest that dhrs4l <dig> and dhrs4l <dig> are paralogues of dhrs <dig>  and that dhrs4l <dig> is the most recent member of the dhrs <dig> gene cluster. the gene sequence identity between dhrs4l <dig> and dhrs4l <dig> is lower than that of dhrs4l <dig> and dhrs <dig>  indicating that dhrs4l <dig> was duplicated directly from dhrs <dig>  not from dhrs4l <dig>

in our previous study, a novel exon a <dig> was identified at the 5'end of the dhrs4l <dig> transcripts, and the sequence of exon a <dig> matches with the intergene sequence between dhrs <dig> and dhrs4l <dig> in genomic dna  <cit> . through sequence blasting, two other homologous sequences of exon a <dig> were found and each was localized downstream of the dhrs4l <dig> or dhrs4l <dig> sequences. in this study, we named these three homologous sequence of exon a as exon a <dig>  exon a <dig> and exon a <dig>  each located downstream of dhrs <dig>  dhrs4l <dig> and dhrs4l <dig> respectively. the spaces between an exon a and its upstream gene was named as insertion a <dig>  insertion a <dig> and insertion a <dig> while the spaces between exon a and its downstream gene was named as insertion  <dig>  insertion  <dig> and insertion  <dig>  respectively . the analysis of the gene structure and homology of the dhrs <dig> gene cluster suggested that dhrs <dig> duplication was initiated from the "insertion," leading to the formation of a copy unit, "insertion-dhrs <dig> gene-insertion a-exon a", which was copied twice in chromosome  <dig>  with the resultant formation of the dhrs <dig> gene cluster . genome duplications are considered as the results of long-term biological evolution and accounting for the bulkiness and complexity of the human genome  <cit> . through the comparative analysis, we identified the general structure of dhrs <dig> gene cluster, and designed the following assays to provide insights into the transcriptional regulation of this gene cluster.

transcription of the human dhrs <dig> gene cluster
the reference sequences of the human dhrs <dig> and dhrs4l <dig> cdna are  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp respectively, each consisting of  <dig> exons. dhrs4l <dig> has a full length of  <dig> bp and is composed of  <dig> exons . based on analysis of the rna variants of dhrs <dig> and dhrs4l <dig> identified in our previous studies and related data from genbank, we found that the alternative splicing was prevalent in dhrs <dig> and dhrs4l <dig> , moreover, dhrs4l <dig> harbored two alternative tss , while dhrs <dig> initiated its transcription only from one site . to explore the transcriptional regulation mechanism of the human dhrs <dig> gene cluster, we first tested the presence of the dhrs4l <dig> rna variants in this study since little was known about the transcription of dhrs4l <dig> 

through 5'race, 3'race and rt-pcr , three full length and four partial rna sequences of dhrs4l <dig> were amplified and identified in human neuroblastoma cell line be-m <dig>  the sequences of these novel transcript variants were submitted to ncbi and recorded as gq <dig>  gq <dig>  gq <dig>  gq <dig>  gq <dig>  gq <dig> and gq <dig>  the analysis of the full length rna variants indicates that dhrs4l <dig> starts its transcription from two alternative sites, exon a <dig> and exon  <dig>  this suggests that the sequence upstream exon a <dig> has the potential promoter activity, similar to exon a <dig>  to initiate the transcription of dhrs4l <dig>  exon a <dig>  the homologous sequence of exon a <dig> downstream of drhs <dig> and exon a <dig> downstream of dhrs4l <dig>  is located downstream of dhrs4l <dig> and only 629bp away from the last exon of dhrs4l <dig>  while the mrna sequences in genbank indicates that exon a <dig> is within the first exon of the lrrc16b  gene not related to dhrs <dig> gene cluster.

alternative splicing patterns often show specificity related to tissue types, development stages and physiological conditions of the cells  <cit> . it is evident in nerve tissue that alternative splicing is correlated with the complex functions of the brain  <cit> . the results of rt-pcr to amplify the rnas from exon  <dig> to exon  <dig> and exon a <dig> to exon  <dig> of dhrs4l <dig> showed that the dhrs4l <dig> rna isoforms existed not only in cell lines from the nervous system, but also in cells from the cervical, hepatic and esophageal tissues, while different first exon  may be utilized to initiate the transcription of dhrs4l <dig> among these cell lines .

through analyzing the homologous identity of dna and the exon composition in the transcripts variants of the dhrs <dig> gene cluster, we found that exon  <dig> was absent in all the spliced variants of dhrs4l <dig> and dhrs4l <dig> initiated from exon a <dig> and exon a <dig> respectively . to verify if the absence of exon  <dig> is just one example found accidentally in cloned sequences or true for all the transcripts of dhrs <dig> cluster, we used forward primer in exon a  and reverse primer in exon  <dig> of dhrs4l <dig> and dhrs4l <dig> respectively to perform rt-pcr in the human neuroblastoma cell lines be-m <dig> and cervical carcinoma cell line hela. no amplifications was observed , suggesting that exons a1/a <dig> and exon  <dig> were mutually exclusive.

in humans, majority of genes are alternatively spliced to express multiple proteins  <cit> . the analysis of the predicted proteins based on different dhrs <dig> rna isoforms showed that most of them contained a domain centre of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family signature, possibly pointing to the functional conservation of the spliced variants. in our previous study, only one protein isoform of dhrs <dig> was identified and found to be correlated with the tumorigenesis of the cervical epithelia  <cit> , while most of the spliced rna isoforms of the dhrs <dig> gene cluster lacked an obvious open reading frame. moreover, the full length rna sequences of dhrs4l <dig> in the previous study  <cit>  and that of dhrs4l <dig> in present study were investigated using the software rnastructure <dig> . this analysis predicted that low minimum free energy was required for them to form a double-stranded rna structure. considering the potential to form a stable secondary rna structure and the lack of open reading frame, we speculate that most rna variants of the dhrs <dig> gene cluster might function as non-coding rnas to regulate gene expression.

transcriptional regulation of the dhrs <dig> gene cluster
focusing our work on the alternative splicing of the dhrs <dig> gene cluster and the roles of these alternatively spliced rnas, we have also been interested in alternative transcriptional regulation of the dhrs <dig> gene cluster. dhrs4l <dig> and dhrs4l <dig> initiate their transcription from two alternative tss, and exon  <dig> is absent in all the transcripts initiated from the exons a <dig> and a <dig> of dhsr4l <dig> and dhsr4l <dig> respectively. previous studies reported that alternative promoter was accompanied by alternative splicing of the initial exon  <cit> . analysis of the sequence upward the exon  <dig> of dhrs4l <dig> and dhrs4l <dig> indicates that exon  <dig> lacks a canonical splice site of ag at its 5' end. it seems that the transcripts initiated from exon a1/a <dig> is spliced directly to the next available splice acceptor site, resulting in the removal of exon  <dig> 

in addition, the homologous comparison of the dhrs <dig> gene cluster and analysis of the positional relationship of dhrs <dig> with the antisense gene c14orf <dig> indicate a possible mechanism for the transcriptional regulation of the dhrs <dig> gene cluster via an antisense transcribed gene. firstly, c14orf <dig> is a typical naturally occurring antisense gene to dhrs <dig>  these two genes have overlapped promoters and 5'  <dig> bp coding regions  that belongs to the cis head-to-head bidirectional transcription  <cit> . given such a positional relationship in the 5' sequence, we propose that dhrs <dig> and c14orf <dig> will interfere with each other in transcription initiation . secondly, antisense rnas may also participate in the transcriptional regulation of the trans-encoded rnas transcribed from different loci  <cit> . previous studies suggest that antisense rna sequences matching with exon-intron border of the primary transcripts may prevent the binding of the splicesome to the splice site, and consequently affecting the posttranscriptional splicing  <cit> . due to the homologies within the dhrs <dig> gene cluster , the transcripts of c14orf <dig> match with exon  <dig> in the primary transcripts of dhrs4l <dig> or dhrs4l <dig>  and possibly take part in the splicing out of exon  <dig> from the transcripts initiated from exon a1/a <dig> . although the alternative promoter may affect the splicing of rna as described above, several subclass models of the splice sites were reported in mammalian pre-mrnas and they functioned more frequently on the first or second intron than on the other order intron  <cit> . the sequence at the 5'end of dhrs4l <dig> exon  <dig> is consistent with the submodel splice acceptor ac, instead of the typical ag sequence. ac functioned as a real splice acceptor site in our previous identified rna variants  of dhrs4l <dig>  if the splice acceptor sequence at the 5'end of exon  <dig> in the dhrs <dig> gene cluster is efficient, the masking by antisense rnas is a likely mechanism to explain the removal of exon  <dig> from the transcripts initiated from exon a <dig> or exon a <dig>  although it needs further study to verify.

CONCLUSIONS
the human dhrs <dig> gene cluster consists of dhrs <dig>  dhrs4l <dig> and dhrs4l <dig>  dhrs4l <dig> and dhrs4l <dig> initiate their transcription from two transcription start sites. furthermore, exon  <dig> is absent in the transcripts initiated from alternative transcription start sites exon a <dig> of dhrs4l <dig> or exon a <dig> of dhrs4l <dig>  based on the analysis of the sequence relationship between c14orf <dig> and dhrs <dig>  we propose that transcriptional process of c14orf <dig> may affect the transcriptional initiation of dhrs <dig>  given the homologous identities of genes within dhrs <dig> gene cluster, antisense rnas of c14orf <dig> may take part in the posttranscriptional splicing regulation of dhrs4l <dig> and dhrs4l <dig> through masking the splicing sites and removing of exon  <dig> from rna transcripts. this is a rare example of one antisense transcript regulating the transcription of different gene in cis and trans manner simultaneously, though antisense rna and bidirectional transcription have been the focus of extensive studies recently.
