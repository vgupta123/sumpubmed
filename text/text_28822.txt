BACKGROUND
group a streptococcus  causes various diseases ranging from mild impetigo, pharyngitis and scarlet fever to more severe and serious sequelae such as rheumatic fever , rheumatic heart disease  and acute glomerulonephritis  <cit> . the incidence of severe gas diseases is high in children aged between 5– <dig> years and is more common in developing countries  <cit> . the prevalence of rf/rhd is known to vary from  <dig>  to  <dig>  children per  <dig> in india  <cit> .

diversity in gas strain is reflected not only among types of strains circulating in a particular community, but also the virulence factors associated with them  <cit> . gas express a variety of virulence factors such as m protein, streptolysin o and s, c5a peptidase, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins , streptococcal protective antigen  and streptococcal inhibitor of complement . some of these virulence factors like spa  <cit>  or sic  <cit>  are found to be restricted in their distribution to specific emm types.

the complement binding protein, sic, was first described by akesson et al,  <dig>  <cit>  in m <dig> and later its variants were reported in m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig>  <cit> . originally, sic was characterized as an inhibitor of complement function that interferes with the function of the membrane attack complex by binding to one or more protein components associated with the complex. subsequently sic has also been shown to inhibit antimicrobial activity of lysozyme, secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor , α and β-defensins, and cathelicidin ll- <dig>  which are components of the innate immune system  <cit> .

the gene encoding sic  is highly polymorphic, both between different emm types and within strains of the same emm type  <cit> . two forms of this gene have been identified, the closely related sic gene  present in emm <dig> and emm <dig>  and distantly related sic gene  isolated from emm <dig> and emm <dig>  <cit> . despite previous reports suggesting crs is associated with only emm <dig> and emm <dig> gas isolates, ma et al  reported the association of the crs gene with other emm types including emm <dig>  emm <dig>  emm <dig>  emm <dig>  emm <dig>  emm <dig>  emm <dig> and emm <dig>  leading to question about the distribution of crs  <cit> .

information regarding the circulating emm type is available from community screening  <cit>  as well as from hospital data  <cit>  in india. however, there is a lack of information regarding the distribution of emm types among strains isolated from different sites  and their virulence factors. earlier, we have reported the presence of toxins  <cit>  in gas strains from our country and very recently, unraveled the conserved nature of other form of sic i.e. the drs gene  <cit> . except for the presence of variable numbers of repeats, drs was found to be conserved not only within indian isolates but also within the isolates from other countries. here, we have explored for the first time the presence of the crs gene in emm1- <dig> isolates of group a streptococcus from throat and skin infections. although this study showed the conserved nature of the crs1- <dig> gene among indian isolates, unlike drs, crs1- <dig> was found to be highly polymorphic when compared to isolates from other countries.

RESULTS
characterization of gas strains by emm typing
for the first time, the emm type distribution of both throat and skin isolates of group a streptococcus from india was studied and compared.  <dig> isolates associated with either throat or skin were categorized into  <dig> different emm types . the majority of throat isolates were of emm <dig> and emm <dig>  whereas emm <dig>  emm <dig> and emm <dig> were mostly associated with skin infection. only eleven emm types were found to be common in both throat and skin isolates. the distribution of emm types among throat and skin samples was different to the study of mcgregor et al  which involved samples belonging to geographic regions far away from indian subcontinent  <cit> . however our data is quite similar to reports from other asian countries, such as japan  <cit>  and nepal <cit> .

* represent strains isolated from rf/rhd patients and ** chorea patient nt: represent nontypeable isolate.

the most frequently observed emm types  among all isolates in this study were emm <dig> , emm <dig>  followed by  <dig> % of emm1- <dig>  emm <dig>  emm <dig> and emm <dig>  these most frequent emm types were not only different from previously reported most prevalent emm types in india  <cit>  but also from epidemiological studies of isolates from other countries like japan  <cit> , taiwan  <cit> , germany  <cit> , australia  <cit>  and united states  <cit> . the difference in the most prevalent emm types of this study in comparison to earlier indian reports may be due to the fact that the most prevalent serotypes within a population changes over time, which can be predicted by continuing surveillance  <cit> . additionally, in this study both throat and skin isolates were studied, whereas earlier studies, involved throat samples only. out of  <dig> emm types,  <dig> have been described in earlier reports from india, where as  <dig> were identical to emm types reported from hong kong  <cit>  and interestingly,  <dig> to emm types of ethiopia  <cit> . identification for the first time of new emm types associated with skin infections in the indian community further justifies the inclusion of skin isolates in this study.

on the basis of differences in amino acid sequence of the test strain from the parent strain in the type specific region of the emm gene,  <dig> types were subdivided in to  <dig> subtypes  <cit> . this observation is in contrast to the report available from mexico where  <dig> types were differentiated into  <dig> subtypes  <cit> . in this study, out of  <dig> types only six isolates of emm <dig> could be divided into two subtypes i.e  <dig>  and  <dig>  .

this study involved a small sampling of isolates from one area of a highly diverse country. the diversity in emm types reflect the extent of heterogeneity which exists among the strains prevalent in india. only  <dig> emm types of this study correspond to emm types used in multivalent vaccine that is under trial in the usa  <cit> . this supports the development of a multivalent vaccine specific for this particular region covering all emm types prevalent in the indian community. however development of such strategies needs further investigation with more samples belonging to each part of india.

screening of isolates for the crs  gene
to elude the host defense and establish infection, gas produces a number of virulence factors, including streptococcal inhibitor of complement . the polymorphic extra cellular complement binding protein sic has not only pathological but also epidemiological significance. we have studied the sic gene distribution by screening ninety four gas isolates. the six emm1- <dig> isolates  were positive for the presence of the crs gene  specific ~830-bp fragment , while in japan the sic gene was isolated from  <dig> different emm types  <cit> . therefore, the isolation rate  of the crs gene in this study was found to be less compared to a study  made in japan  <cit> . our data reports for the first time the presence of the crs gene from emm type 1– <dig>  which is a distinct type, not a subtype of emm <dig> .

crs gene sequence and phylogenetic analysis
the crs gene product was further confirmed by sequence analysis using modified internal primers  <cit> , which yielded a  <dig> bp full-length crs gene sequence . the six crs positive isolates did not show intravariation either at the dna or at the amino acid level. however, like sic <dig> , crs1- <dig> also possessed a short repeat region , central long repeat region  and c proximal proline rich region  as reported earlier  <cit> . a number of mutations such as insertions and deletions were observed in crs1- <dig> throughout the sequence in comparison to sic <dig>   <cit>  and crs <dig>  <cit> . similar to sic <dig> , a deletion of five amino acids  was observed in crs1- <dig> in comparison to crs <dig> at position  <dig>  however, an insertion of  <dig> amino acids  at position  <dig>  similar to crs <dig> in comparison to sic <dig>  has been noticed in crs1- <dig>  on the other hand a deletion of  <dig> amino acids  at position  <dig> makes crs1- <dig> unique from both crs <dig>  and crs <dig> . insertion and deletion sequences monitored in crs1- <dig> in comparison to sic <dig>  and crs <dig> is different from the  <dig> amino acid insertion  and the  <dig> amino acid deletion  sequence, most commonly observed in different alleles of sic <dig>   <cit> . it is likely, because this gene is under strong natural selection pressure  <cit> , and as such harbors significant sequence variation and is highly divergent. the high number of allelic variations in sic is likely due to the fact that humans mount antibody response to sic, a process that enhances variation by selecting escape mutants  <cit> . it is also reported that human anti-sic antibodies are directed against virtually all regions of sic that are highly polymorphic in natural population, which further strengthen the antibody mediated sic diversification  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis  indicates the variant of sic, crs1- <dig>  is more closely related to crs <dig>  <cit>  reported from australia compare to sic <dig>   <cit>  reported from sweden . this correlation raises the possibility that crs <dig> may have originated from emm1- <dig> instead of emm <dig> .

expression of crs gene at protein level
the secreted proteins from all emm1- <dig> isolates were seen in sds-page  and specific antisera was used for western blot analysis which confirmed the expression of crs1- <dig> from all these isolates. all six emm1- <dig> isolates  showed the crs specific protein of 34-kda similar to emm <dig>  .

genomic location of crs  <dig>  gene
in emm <dig> , the crs gene is located within the mga regulon whereas it is located outside the mga regulon in emm <dig>  in this study a pcr based method  <cit>  was applied to find the genomic location of crs1- <dig>  the amplified product of size  <dig> -kb and  <dig> -kb obtained by using primer pair p <dig> – p <dig> and p <dig> – p <dig>  <cit>  respectively indicated the genomic location of crs1- <dig> to be the same as for crs <dig>  . an additional pcr based analysis, which showed a 400-bp fragment by using primer pair p <dig> – p <dig>  <cit>  further confirmed this observation . since emm <dig>  and emm1- <dig> shares majority of alleles, as shown by mlst analysis  <cit> , therefore such similarity in the genomic location of crs1- <dig> and sic <dig>  is not unexpected.

screening of sic positive isolates for spea
to examine the presence of other virulence factors, sic positive isolates were screened for the phage encoded virulence factor spea, which is also known as a source of diversity in these gas strains  <cit> . association of the spea gene with sic positive isolates only from skin infection  genetically differentiated them from throat isolates. this suggests the identification of two variants  <cit>  of sic positive isolates, carrying the conserved crs gene. these two variants , not only belong to different sources  but also to different regions of north india, and were also collected at different time periods.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we found that, although emm type pattern among throat and skin isolates was different but no significant association between emm type and source  was observed. out of  <dig> different emm types, only six emm1- <dig> isolates were positive for crs gene validating its highly restricted distribution. although no intravariation was observed in the crs1- <dig> gene, a large number of allelic variations were observed in the crs1- <dig> gene in comparison to crs genes reported from other countries. this suggests the crs gene is highly divergent in comparison to drs. moreover, variation in virulence characteristics like possession of spea in skin specific isolates not only differentiated emm1- <dig> isolates in two variants, but also reflects that virulence may be source specific, not type specific. the presence of conserved sic in these isolates further suggests a single allele of crs may be prevalent in the gas isolates of indian community, showing diverse emm type distribution in throat versus skin isolates.
