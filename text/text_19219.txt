BACKGROUND
while the rna transcriptome was once considered to be a faithful intermediate between genome and proteome, a greater appreciation of its scope and function has developed over the past several years. in particular, much recent attention has focused on small  rna species which significantly impact gene expression in eukaryotes, either by modulating transcript levels or the packaging of specific chromatin . however, much larger noncoding rnas  also play fundamental roles in eukaryotic metabolism and development  <cit> .

like smaller rnas, large ncrnas  can also modulate chromatin states and gene expression. in drosophila melanogaster, two ncrnas, rox <dig> and rox <dig>  target the male specific lethal  complex to the male x-chromosome, a crucial step in drosophila dosage compensation  <cit> . in mammalian dosage compensation, the large xist transcript along with its antisense counterpart, tsix, are crucial in modulating the epigenetic state of x-linked loci . after transcription, xist spreads across the entire length of one of the two x-chromosomes in female cells, resulting in the transcriptional silencing of most other loci located on the inactive x  <cit> . another large ncrna, nron, was recently shown to be involved in nuclear trafficking, through its interaction with a variety of nuclear import proteins  <cit> .

a number of rnas also localize to specific nuclear subdomains, such as the ten to thirty sc <dig> splicing domains localized within each mammalian cell . sc <dig> domains comprise large  structures defined by immunofluorescence to the spliceosome assembly factor sc <dig>  <cit> ; this excludes the cajal bodies and smaller entities defined by the snrnp "speckle" staining pattern, but otherwise, sc <dig> domains overlap nuclear speckles, splicing factor compartments , and interchromatin granule clusters . much debate has centered on the function and composition of these domains, either as sites of pre-mrna metabolism and export  <cit>  or storage sites of splicing factors  <cit> . while each sc <dig> domain is enriched in a large number of splicing factors and other factors involved in mrna metabolism, a large pool of polyadenylated ) and possibly nuclear retained  <cit>  rna also localizes to each domain  <cit> , the identity of which has implications for the function of sc <dig> domains.

the function of noncoding rnas which act as chromatin modulators and nuclear scaffolds, depends on their localization to the nucleus. unlike rnas coding for nuclear proteins, which exit the nucleus when used as templates for protein synthesis, noncoding nuclear rnas may exist solely within the nucleus throughout their lifetime. we reasoned that rna transcripts with nuclear roles like xist or comprising the poly component of sc <dig> domains could be identified using a simple microarray approach to compare nuclear and cytoplasmic rna populations. with this approach, we identified two evolutionarily conserved large noncoding transcripts that, like xist, are enriched in human nuclei. both nuclear enriched abundant transcripts  are located on chromosome  <dig> in humans, less than  <dig> kb apart. analysis of publicly available mouse transcriptome data confirms that the mouse homologs of these noncoding rnas, located less than  <dig> kb apart on mouse chromosome  <dig>  are also nuclear enriched. each of these noncoding rnas shows a broad distribution in different tissues, though their expression patterns differ slightly. through rna fluorescence in situ hybridization , we show that the mouse and human homologs of neat <dig> localize to the periphery of sc <dig> domains. strikingly, the second transcript, neat <dig> localizes to the interior of all mature sc <dig> domains, suggesting a role for the transcript in either the structure or function of these nuclear substructures. such pan-localization to sc <dig> domains by a noncoding poly transcript has been discussed for several years  <cit> , thus the identification of neat <dig> represents an important step towards the further molecular and functional dissection of these domains.

RESULTS
an array-based approach to identify ubiquitously expressed nuclear rnas
the classical long ncrna with a nuclear role is xist. xist is a large, spliced, ncrna, which is polyadenylated and stably expressed in female somatic cells where it localizes to the nucleus and tightly associates with one of the two x chromosomes  <cit> . using xist's properties as a guide, we looked for noncoding rnas with nuclear functions by searching for similarly nuclear-enriched noncoding transcripts.

to identify nuclear enriched transcripts, we utilized the affymetrix u133a and u133b expression array set to compare the nuclear and cytoplasmic rna fractions of two female cell types: the primary human fibroblast cell line, wi- <dig>  and an epstein-barr virus -transformed lymphoblastoid line, gm <dig>  based on the unigene database , these arrays allow the analysis of  <dig>  transcripts with over  <dig>  probes. in each cell line, many probe sets were enriched greater than 2-fold in the nuclear fraction, however only  <dig> of these were enriched in both . nuclear enriched probes were aligned to the human genome and their corresponding loci described using the university of california at santa cruz genome browser  <cit> . based on these analyses, these abundant nuclear sequences included six probes to xist, forty-two to introns, fifty-one to open reading frame  genes, six to repeat elements, and four probes each to two autosomal seemingly noncoding rna loci.

the presence of a number of intronic probes on the affymetrix arrays was striking, suggesting that a large number of unigene est clusters are not unique transcripts but instead represent improperly annotated introns. indeed, many of these intronic probes had corresponding poly repeats located in downstream genomic sequence which likely facilitated the annealing of oligo-dt primers at these sites during reverse transcription reactions. affymetrix array design, which uses sequences selected from genbank, dbest and refseq, may not have completely filtered out such such falsely primed intronic-derived ests. genes do sometimes reside within the introns of other transcripts  <cit> , however, of the over  <dig> intronic probes we examined, all were transcribed from the same strand as the gene within which they reside. as there is no reported bias for intra-intronic genes to be transcribed in the same direction as the overlapping transcript, these data suggest that the vast majority of these probes detect intronic rna rather than novel genes.

nuclear enriched, non-intronic sequences aligned to either repeat elements and orf or apparently non-orf  rna transcripts. the enrichment of orf genes within the nucleus may hold clues to rna metabolism and may indicate high-level constitutive transcription coupled to relatively rapid cytoplasmic mrna turnover. perhaps the regulation of these genes is post-transcriptional, with other factors  regulating cytoplasmic rna stability. alternatively, they may be regulated by nuclear retention mechanisms similar to those allowing rapid translation of the mouse cationic amino acid transporter in response to stress  <cit> .

to address these possibilities we used the gostat program  <cit>  to determine if any gene ontology subgroup was overrepresented in our sample of nuclear enriched genes. the  <dig> probes to coding sequences  represent  <dig> unique genes of which  <dig> possess gene ontology annotations. of these,  <dig> are nuclear components as compared to  <dig> of  <dig> in the genome as a whole, revealing a statistically significant enrichment of nuclear genes in this sample set . the biological significance of this finding is unclear but may reflect translation of these proteins either within the nucleus or within the perinuclear space  <cit> , which may have copurified with the nuclear fraction.

of the  <dig> noncoding transcripts identified, xist is the most consistently nuclear-enriched ncrna identified by this screen, as the six probes to it are enriched  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold in the nuclear fraction. probes to two autosomal apparently noncoding rna loci are also comparably nuclear enriched in both cell lines. we named these two loci neat <dig> and neat <dig>  to reflect their status as nuclear enriched, abundant transcripts and their clustering within the genome . four probes to the first locus, neat <dig>  are nuclear enriched from  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold in fibroblasts and lymphoblasts and four different probes to the neat <dig> locus show nuclear enrichment from  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold in fibroblasts and lymphoblasts. neat <dig> and neat <dig> were also as abundant as xist as their probes showed a similar range of intensities as xist probes.

two noncoding rnas enriched in the nuclei of human cells
genomic alignment, along with northern blot and rapid amplification of cdna ends  analyses, defines the two neat transcripts as unique loci, separated by less than  <dig> kb on chromosome 11q <dig>  of humans with no apparent intervening genes . the genomic proximity of these two transcripts is striking, given that the human genome is roughly  <dig> mb and the probability of an unbiased screen returning two genes located side by side is less than  <dig> in  <dig> . transcription within the neat <dig> and neat <dig> loci has previously been described but not fully characterized  <cit> . notably, there is no significant homology between the neat <dig> and neat <dig> loci .

neat <dig> is a large, infrequently spliced rna
our detailed molecular analysis by 5'-rlm/3'-race and cdna sequencing indicates that the primary transcript from the neat <dig> locus is a predominantly unspliced,  <dig>  kb, poly ncrna  . northern blot analysis suggests a transcript ~ <dig> kb in length with broad expression and highest levels in the ovary, prostate, colon and pancreas . while this blot provided clear evidence of a widely expressed  <dig> kb transcript, transcripts above  <dig> kb in length may not have transferred efficiently to the membrane. a larger poly transcript   with an overlapping 5' end is also suggested by other, less precise northern data . the size of this transcript is difficult to define, due likely to a combination of transcript heterogeneity and the difficulty of detecting large rnas on northern blots. quantitative rt-pcr analysis suggests that this large transcript is expressed at significantly lower levels than the ~ <dig> kb transcript . while a small  cdna clone, trophoblast-derived noncoding rna , mapping to the 3' end of neat <dig>  has also been described, it is exclusively expressed in trophoblasts  <cit> . our results indicate the existence of at least two unique isoforms of neat1: a widely expressed, abundant  <dig> kb transcript and a much larger , less common transcript sharing a transcriptional start site, based on 5'-rlm-race and northern analysis.

neat <dig> is a large, infrequently spliced rna
previously, a transcript in the neat <dig> region was partially described in a screen for genes overexpressed in metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer and given the name metastasis associated in lung adenocarcinoma transcript  <dig>   <cit> . while malat- <dig> was initially defined as a cluster of ests more than  <dig> kb in length, our more precise 5'-rlm/3'-race studies of the neat <dig> locus show a slightly different sequence for the transcript which more closely matches the current database of ests  . as the functional relevance of this transcript to metastatic potential awaits further analysis, we will refer to this transcript as neat2/malat- <dig> 

the vast majority of neat2/malat- <dig> is present in the cell in an unspliced form . like neat <dig>  neat2/malat- <dig> shows broad tissue expression, with highest expression in the ovaries, prostate and colon , but unlike neat <dig>  not the pancreas. importantly, neither transcript  has an open reading frame  of significant size. despite the presence of antisense transcripts in the genomic annotation of the neat cluster, we detect no antisense transcription at either neat locus in gm <dig> cells, hela cells or in the undifferentiated female human embryonic stem cell line h <dig>  by quantitative rt-pcr and northern analysis .

comparative genomic analysis of neat <dig> and neat2
the presence of two highly conserved areas within neat <dig>  along with genomic synteny, facilitated the discovery of the mouse homolog of neat <dig> on chromosome  <dig> . detailed molecular analysis suggests that mouse neat <dig> is a ~ <dig>  kb transcript with no significant orfs . unlike human neat <dig>  quantitative rt-pcr analysis does not detect any larger transcripts from the locus . moreover, the only sequence conservation between mouse and human is within this  <dig>  kb transcript.

the mouse neat <dig> locus is located approximately  <dig> kb from mouse neat <dig> . as with human neat <dig>  murine neat <dig> has no significant orfs. while mouse malat- <dig> was originally described as a series of overlapping ests homologous to human malat- <dig>  <cit> , we have delineated the transcript from the mouse neat <dig> locus by northern analysis and 5'-rlm/3'-race . taken together, these data indicate that the mouse neat2/malat- <dig> transcript is ~ <dig> kb, with broad tissue expression. like human neat2/malat- <dig>  mouse neat2/malat- <dig> has no significant orfs.

to the extent that tissues overlap between blots, mouse neat <dig> and neat2/malat- <dig> show similarly broad expression to human neat <dig> and neat2/malat- <dig>  with highest levels in ovary, kidney, lung and thymus . significantly, while the sequence of both transcripts is conserved within the mammalian lineage, this conservation does not extend to any orfs.

neat2/malat- <dig> is exceptionally conserved, considering that noncoding rnas typically have less evolutionary constraints placed on their primary sequence than protein-coding genes  <cit>  . in particular, where insertions and deletions often disrupt orfs by frame-shift mutations, noncoding rnas are likely more tolerant of such changes, provided that they do not interfere with secondary structure or function. neat2/malat- <dig> does not contain the series of expanded repeats that are seen in xist , suggesting that perhaps neat2neat2/malat- <dig> is less tolerant of such changes than xist. comparative genomic analysis indicates that neat2/malat- <dig> is conserved within multiple mammalian species, yet no neat2/malat- <dig> homologs were identified in any non-mammalian species. the presence of a neat2/malat- <dig> homolog in the non-eutherian opossum, monodelphis domestica, together with the apparent absence of the transcript in non-mammalian species suggests that neat2/malat- <dig> is specific to the mammalian lineage. the strikingly high level of conservation of neat2/malat- <dig> within mammals suggests multiple constraints on its sequence. like the conservation of other noncoding elements within the genome  <cit> , this conservation awaits explanation through further analysis.

neat <dig> does not share the broad conservation seen for neat2/malat- <dig> between human and mouse . two small segments of the transcript are, however, conserved between humans and mice. strikingly, the region most conserved between mouse and human neat <dig> is also the most conserved region between human neat <dig> and neat <dig> of dogs, rats, and cows . interestingly, neat <dig> is present on two different dog chromosomes, only one of which is clustered with the sole dog neat2/malat- <dig>  lack of synteny surrounding the neat <dig> paralogs suggests that a large-scale duplication within the dog lineage does not explain this event. like neat2/malat- <dig>  no non-mammalian homologs of neat <dig> were identified. additionally, we cannot rule out the possibility that neat <dig> may be eutherian specific, due to gaps in the opossum genome around the putative neat cluster. as previously noted, dot plot analyses reveal that despite the genomic proximity of the neat <dig> and neat <dig> loci, their transcripts show no significant homology to each other .

the identification of mouse homologs of neat <dig> and neat2/malat- <dig> allowed us to examine nuclear enrichment data from the mouse transcriptome project  <cit> . this dataset was generated using massive parallel signature sequencing , a technique which involves the sequencing based quantification of over  <dig> million short ests per sample  <cit> . est populations of nuclear and post-nuclear subcellular fractionations were examined in the male mouse cell line blk cl. <dig> and male mouse liver tissue. in both the blk cl. <dig> cell line and mouse liver, both neat <dig> and neat2/malat- <dig> were both more than ten-fold enriched in nuclear fractions . only four other transcripts  show nuclear enrichment levels similar to neat <dig> and neat2/malat- <dig>  these protein coding transcripts may be, like those seen in our microarray screen, regulated by various post-transcriptional mechanisms which result in their nuclear retention. two-hundred and fifteen unique mouse genes were more than  <dig> fold enriched in both blk cl. <dig> and liver nuclei  and of these  <dig> had gene ontology annotations. similar to our human studies, of these annotated genes,  <dig> were nuclear components as compared to  <dig> of  <dig> genes in the murine genome as a whole, revealing a statistically significant enrichment of nuclear genes in this sample set . as noted above, this may reflect nuclear or perinuclear translation of these transcripts and copurification of the perinuclear component with the nuclear fraction. notably, nuclear enrichment of both neat <dig> and neat2/malat- <dig> is observed in mice using a distinct technology for expression analysis of different tissues than were used in our human studies.

like xist, neat <dig> and neat2/malat- <dig> appear to represent conserved nuclear-enriched, ncrnas present within a diverse range of human and mouse cells. taken together, these results suggest an important role for neat <dig> and neat2/malat- <dig> within the nuclei of mammalian cells.

subcellular localization of neat <dig> and neat2/malat-1
rna fish analyses confirmed the nuclear enrichment of both neat <dig> and neat2/malat- <dig> in a broad range of human and mouse cell lines. while we do not rule out the possibility of very low cytoplasmic levels, significant signal is not observed outside the nucleus; even using conditions optimized for cytoplasmic mrna . both these transcripts are abundant and easily detectable. in interphase nuclei, both neat <dig> and neat2/malat- <dig> seem to avoid nucleoli and dapi dense heterochromatin.

in mouse and human cells, neat1/neat <dig> displays a highly unusual localization pattern; neat1/neat <dig> localizes to multiple large, bright foci which are often widely distributed . in some cells, these foci have a more restricted distribution, showing polarity in two regions of many cells . these neat <dig> rna foci show sharply defined borders and little nucleoplasmic signal. rna fish studies show no evidence that the > <dig> kb neat <dig> transcript localizes in separate foci from the smaller ~ <dig> kb transcript . while the size and number of neat <dig> foci vary within an individual cell population, human cells tend to have more  neat <dig> foci that are smaller ; whereas mouse cells have fewer , larger  neat <dig> foci .

neat2/malat- <dig> shows a broad distribution throughout the nucleus. in many cells neat2/malat- <dig> is concentrated in ten to twenty distinct "domains" , although weaker nucleoplasmic signal is also detected. the mouse cell lines examined show a mixed distribution: many cells have neat2/malat- <dig> rna concentrated in domains, while other cells in the same population have only strong nucleoplasmic signal .

early g <dig> daughter cells show two sites of transcription for both neat <dig> and neat2/malat- <dig>  and simultaneous gene/rna localization  indicates they are both biallelically expressed. in contrast to xist, neat2/malat- <dig> rna shows no preferential association with its parental chromosome  <cit>  . although neat <dig> rna foci show a greater localization near chromosome  <dig> than does neat2/malat- <dig> rna, neat <dig> transcripts do move away from their parent chromosome and distribute more broadly in the nucleus .

examination of the relationship between neat <dig> rna foci and neat2/malat- <dig> rna foci reveals that they do not overlap significantly in any cell type, but have a non-random and close association. in both human and mouse cells, the majority of neat <dig> foci preferentially localize to the periphery of neat2/malat- <dig> domains; oftentimes multiple neat <dig> foci encircle the neat2/malat- <dig> domain .

the relationship between neat <dig> and neat  <dig> rnas and sc <dig> domains
as neat <dig> and neat2/malat- <dig> transcripts are distributed across the nucleus in discrete domains, we asked whether these domains overlap with previously described nuclear structures. our initial analyses indicate that the domain distribution of neat2/malat- <dig> rna is similar to nuclear structures called sc <dig> splicing domains. as previously discussed, these structures are enriched in poly rna and factors involved in processing, splicing and export of mrna. many snrnas concentrate within these domains and several individual mrnas have been shown to enter the domains with which their genes associate upon transcription. however, while hypothesized for many years, no specific large poly species, coding or noncoding, has been shown to be a component of all domains. we asked whether neat2/malat- <dig> was a component of these domains by performing rna fish in combination with immunohistochemical labeling with an antibody to sc <dig> in human cells and srm- <dig> in mouse cells. strikingly, in interphase cells with the typical domain pattern, neat2/neat <dig> rna is found in every sc35/srm- <dig> domain . while neat2/malat- <dig> rna is clearly a component of these domains, there is not precise overlap: neat2/malat- <dig> rna tends to concentrate more in the center of the domain but also defines a larger domain than either sc <dig> or srm- <dig> . sc <dig> was previously shown to form a smaller inner core within a larger domain defined by poly rna and sm-defined speckles  <cit> .

we next colocalized neat1/neat <dig> rna with sc35/srm- <dig> in mouse and human cells . unsurprisingly, given their localization relative to neat2/malat- <dig> foci, neat <dig> foci predominantly border the domains, with multiple foci oftentimes encircling a single domain, especially in human cells.

as it has been speculated that a structural poly rna may be at the core of sc <dig> domains we first compared the distribution of poly rna and neat2/malat- <dig> rna in mouse and human cells. these analyses revealed that poly rna and neat2/malat- <dig> transcripts were completely coincident in nuclear domains . immediately after mitosis there is a short window of time in which the sc <dig>  and poly  domains are clearly reformed, but neat2/malat- <dig> rna only overlaps the domains close to its transcription site. shortly after in g <dig>  neat2/malat- <dig> quickly distributes to all domains. these results show that while neat2/malat- <dig> rna is a component of sc <dig> domains in most cells, it is not necessary for their formation.

discussion
in a microarray screen for nuclear, polyadenylated noncoding rnas, we identified three abundant transcripts with significant nuclear retention: the canonical ncrna, xist, and two large noncoding loci on human chromosome  <dig>  we show that these two ncrnas are differentially expressed in a wide range of tissues in human and mouse and localize to specific subnuclear domains that have been the subject of much interest in relation to mrna metabolism.

our rationale for examining the nucleus for enriched poly transcripts was prompted by two areas of research. first, the chromosome-wide regulation of monoallelically expressed genes   <cit>  suggests that there may be regulatory rnas similar to xist that interact with specific autosomes. second, earlier biochemical studies indicated that there is a substantial population of heterogeneous nuclear rna that does not give rise to cytoplasmic rna  <cit>  and it has long been suggested that this nuclear-retained rna may provide insights into nuclear structure  <cit> .

recent genomic studies have identified a large number of putative ncrnas based on analysis of ests , however these approaches provide little insight into the biology of the many rnas identified. here we used a unique approach to identify poly ncrnas that met specific criteria of abundance and, most importantly, nuclear enrichment. using affymetrix arrays to compare the expression levels of over  <dig>  transcripts in nuclear and cytoplasmic rna fractions from two human cell-types, we identified transcripts from two loci, which like xist are significantly enriched in the nucleus. these two loci are located less than  <dig> kb apart, yet represent two different genes with no homology to each other. neat <dig> and neat2/malat- <dig> are conserved within the mammalian lineage, yet neither contains conserved open reading frames. while neat <dig> contains two segments of high conservation, the ~ <dig> kb sequence of neat2/malat- <dig> is highly conserved without insertions or deletions. this high level of conservation is particularly striking in light of the relative lack of conservation typically seen for large ncrnas  <cit> . in fact, neat2/malat- <dig> appears to be more conserved than the canonical noncoding rna xist. while there are reports of both a larger, less abundant transcript and of a much smaller trophoblast specific transcript  that map to the human neat <dig> locus  <cit> , both of these transcripts lie outside any region of conservation. both human and mouse homologs of neat <dig> and neat2/malat- <dig> show broad, differential expression patterns across many different tissues. further, in both organisms, of the over  <dig>  transcripts examined in human and the over  <dig>  transcripts examined in mice, neat1/neat <dig> and neat2/neat <dig> are among the most nuclear enriched poly transcripts in multiple cell lines. taken together, these findings of high conservation, broad expression and nuclear enrichment strongly suggest that neat <dig> and neat2/malat- <dig> have important functional roles within the mammalian nucleus.

the subnuclear distribution of neat2/malat- <dig> rna provides immediate insights into its function. the broad distribution of neat2/malat- <dig> rna clearly indicates that it is not involved in chromatin regulation of its parent chromosome. sc <dig> splicing domains  are essentially universal components of the nuclei in higher eukaryotes. a number of specific protein coding genes have been identified which preferentially localize to the periphery of an sc <dig> domain in each cell, and for several of these their transcripts localize within those particular domains . these domains concentrate numerous splicing factors, sr proteins, poly rna and mrna export factors  <cit> . the concentration of neat2/malat- <dig> rna in these domains thus strongly suggests it has a function related to pre-mrna metabolism.

as previously mentioned, a large pool of polyadenylated ) rna localizes to each domain  <cit>  and the identity of this poly component has implications for the function of these structures. while it has long been speculated that some  <cit>  or possibly all  <cit>  of the poly rna in these regions may comprise a long-lived structural rna, the poly component of these domains might also be a heterogeneous mixture of pre-mrna or mature rna transcripts at their sites of maturation. while this latter condition would indicate that sc <dig> domains function as active sites of rna processing and export, if this poly component is composed of a small number of structural noncoding rnas, this might instead suggest that sc <dig> domains function as storage sites for splicing factors. importantly, such stable localization of ncrnas to these domains could not only indicate a role for ncrna in establishing the structure of sc <dig> domains but might also indicate that these ncrnas contribute to the function of pre-existing domains either through their own enzymatic activity or by targeting specific proteins or rnas to those domains.

while sc <dig> domains contain high concentrations of snrnas, no large poly rna has been previously identified as a component of these domains. the presence of neat2/malat- <dig> in these regions is thus of substantial interest. since neat2/malat- <dig> exhibits a pan-localization to every sc <dig> domain in most cells, we surmised that it may serve as a structural scaffold involved in the initial formation of these domains. however, our observations in early post-mitotic daughter cells argue against such an interpretation: domains in these cells clearly contain sc <dig> and poly rna, whereas neat2/malat- <dig> rna is localized to just two sites of transcription. thus, while neat2/malat- <dig> rna may be a component of the poly rna in these domains, it does not account for all of it, consistent with evidence of other poly pre-mrnas in these regions. this does not rule out a later structural role for neat2/malat- <dig>  but suggests it is more likely important for the function of pre-existing domains, rather than establishing the initial structure of these domains.

the identity of this remaining poly signal present at the formation of sc <dig> domains is not known but is suggested by our studies. insight into the nature of this rna can be derived from the fact that no other poly transcripts were identified as nuclear enriched in our analyses of the human and mouse transcriptomes. given the nature of our study, we would have expected to find any highly expressed, nuclear retained, long ncrnas which act in the formation of sc <dig> domains. thus, our results suggest that the remaining poly population present at the formation of sc <dig> domains is either short, poorly expressed, heterogeneous in nature, or not nuclear retained.

our results indicate that there are at least two distinct populations of poly rna within sc <dig> domains. neat2/malat- <dig> is highly expressed and present in all mature sc <dig> domains, whereas the examination of nascent sc <dig> domains indicates the existence of a second population of other poly rnas. further experiments will be necessary to determine the exact extent to which neat2/malat- <dig> rna contributes to the overall poly rna signal in sc <dig> domains. however, if neat2/malat- <dig> comprises the bulk of the poly component of sc <dig> domains its properties might obscure the properties of the remaining poly signal. thus, while many studies have made general observations concerning the properties of the bulk poly component of sc <dig> domains, our results caution against over interpretation of these results. directed study of neat2/malat- <dig> should help place these earlier observations in a clearer context.

the finding that neat <dig> rna clusters typically localize at the edges of sc <dig> domains, regions known to be enriched in active genes  <cit> , suggests a possible relationship of neat <dig> to pre-mrna metabolism, however, in this case the implication is less clear. the observation that neat <dig> foci are often limited to certain nuclear regions does not appear to reflect a confinement to its parent chromosome, but likely reflects an affinity for other nuclear structures of limited mobility. studies examining the relationship of neat <dig> rna to other nuclear structures are ongoing , and preliminarily indicate that neat <dig> foci may have a complex relationship to a subset of paraspeckles, nuclear compartments which localize to the edge of speckles and contain components involved in adenosine to inosine substitution  <cit> .

the overexpression of a transcript at the human neat <dig> locus, malat- <dig>  has been associated with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma  <cit>  but whether this is causative or merely correlative has not been established. supporting our results, during the preparation of this manuscript the overexpression of a transcript corresponding to murine neat <dig> termed vinc  was described in rabies infection and shown to be nuclear enriched in mouse renal adenocarcinoma cells   <cit> . to reflect its enrichment in the nucleus of many different cell types in different organisms and its homology to human neat <dig>  we refer to the neat1/vinc transcript as neat <dig>  given their broad expression and localization in ubiquitous nuclear structures, any dissection of the function of neat1/vinc and neat2/malat- <dig> will require the examination of these rnas in the context of a variety of cell types and conditions.

aside from its utility in identifying two unique nuclear localized noncoding rnas, the data from our screens yields other intriguing results when examined as a whole. for instance, our screens reveal the nuclear enrichment of rna species that code for proteins with known nuclear localization patterns. such enrichment may be indicative of nuclear translation, or translation of these proteins in the perinuclear space. additionally, these studies identified several intronic probes in the affymetrix dataset . as these probes are all transcribed from the same strand as the gene within which they reside and there is no reported bias for intronic genes to be transcribed in the same direction as the overlapping transcript, it appears that these probes detect intronic rna rather than novel genes. this grouping of intronic probes might be of use in some interesting large scale splicing analyses. for instance, given that many of these intronic probes have corresponding exonic probes also represented in the u133a and b chipsets, analysis of existing gene expression omnibus datasets for changes in the relative representation of these probes across samples might uncover conditions, cell types, or genetic backgrounds which display differential patterns of rna splicing with respect to these genes.

CONCLUSIONS
our genome-wide screens in two mammalian species suggest that there are no more than three abundant large non-coding polyadenylated rnas in the nucleus; the canonical large noncoding rna xist, neat <dig> and neat2/malat- <dig>  a function for neat <dig> and neat2/malat- <dig> in mrna metabolism is suggested by their high levels of conservation and their intimate association with sc <dig> splicing domains in multiple mammalian species. we have taken advantage of the power of genome-scale expression analysis and publicly available transcriptome data to study the subcellular localization of rna species. by these broad approaches we have precisely identified noncoding rna components of an enigmatic nuclear structure. the identification of specific poly rna species within sc <dig> domains should greatly facilitate the functional dissection of these domains. further cytological analyses of the relationship of neat <dig> and neat2/malat- <dig> to pre-mrna metabolism and specific nuclear structures is ongoing. inhibition of these rnas, through knockout or rna-mediated interference , may yield further clues as to their role in nuclear architecture or cell function and may ultimately facilitate the functional dissection of the nuclear structures with which they associate.
