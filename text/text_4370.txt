BACKGROUND
human embryonic stem cells  are, like mouse es cells, derived from the inner cell mass of blastocyst-stage embryos and capable of differentiating along the three germ layer lineages in vivo and in vitro  <cit> . another defining property of es cells is their ablity to self-renew under appropriate conditions, i.e. to give rise to equivalent daughter cells allowing indefinite propagation in culture  <cit> . the undifferentiated state is maintained by the action of transcription factors  some of which are es cell-specific and common between human and mouse es cells  <cit> . boyer et al.  <cit>  have identified binding sites of the core transcription factors oct <dig>  nanog, and sox <dig> within regulatory regions of most known genes by chip-chip analyses using human es cells. this landmark study revealed that these three factors bind to large numbers of both transcribed and inactive genes many of which are co-occupied by at least two of these three factors. these included the oct <dig>  nanog, and sox <dig> genes themselves, thus suggesting auto and reciprocal regulation amongst themselves, which is supported by independent findings  <cit> . a number of target genes inactive in hes cells were developmental regulators, thus suggesting that the core transcription factors maintain the undifferentiated state by directly repressing these. another level of transciptional repression has recently been revealed by genome-wide location analyses of polycomb complexes which repress their target genes through epigenetic modification of chromatin structure  <cit> . es cell chromatin is characterised by an overall decondensed structure, active histone marks and a large fraction of only loosely bound proteins, notably histones. furthermore, chromatin remodelling factors may actively contribute to stem cell maintenance and early differentiation .

despite these similarities between human and mouse es cells there are striking differences with regards to surface marker expression, signaling pathways promoting self-renewal  <cit> , and overall growth properties. for instance, mouse es cells are positive for the cell surface antigen ssea <dig> but not for ssea <dig> and  <dig>  conversely, hescs are negative for ssea <dig> but stain positive for ssea <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . in hes cells, activation of smad 2/ <dig> by tgfβ/activin/nodal  and suppression of bmp signaling is required for the maintenance of the undifferentiated state, in serum replacement-containing medium  <cit> . moreover, fgf signaling appears to fulfill a master regulatory role in sustaining hesc self-renewal since these cells can be propagated under chemically defined conditions with bfgf supplementation only  <cit> . furthermore, unlike mescs, human es cells display very low replating efficiencies with high rates of spontaneous differentiation when seeded as individual cells  <cit> . thus, they need to be passaged as clumps of cells, which also enhances their karyotypic stability  <cit> .

rna interference  <cit>  is a powerful tool to investigate self-renewal in es cells  <cit> . unfortunately, human es cells are inefficiently transfected using conventional lipofection protocols. however, human embryonic carcinoma cells may present an alternative model system, as recently proposed  <cit> . these are the stem cells of teratocarcinomas, a subset of germ cell tumors. despite their distinct origin, hec cells share a number of characteristics with hes cells such as cellular morphology, surface antigen expression, differentiation capacity, and control of the undifferentiated state by oct <dig>  <cit> . in addition, the overall gene expression profiles of hec and hes cells appear to be very similar . moreover, most hec cell lines do not require special culture conditions such as feeder layer support or the addition of extrinsic factors. this, however, may be due to their aneuploid nature resulting in part from an adaptation to the culture environment. in fact, hes cells tend to acquire similar chromosomal abnormalities as hec cells do  <cit> . moreover, the need to maintain most hec cell lines at high density  <cit>  may be an indication for autocrine activation of signaling pathways sustaining self-renewal. however, this remains to be investigated.

for these reasons, hec cells may be a suitable model for studying the regulation of self-renewal in pluripotent human cells. results obtained from such an analysis may be extrapolated to hes cells or reveal specific differences between the two types of cells.

RESULTS
silencing of gene products enriched in hec and hes cells
genes controling the maintenance of the undifferentiated state in hes cells may be es cell-specific and/or down-regulated upon differentiation. based on these requirements we performed whole genome expression analysis of hes cells and compared these samples to universal reference rna of pooled cell lines . this resulted in the identification of >  <dig> genes that are preferentially expressed in hescs . to further filter the dataset we used expression data of undifferentiated vs. differentiated hes cells and work published by others  <cit> . we then defined a set of genes supported by a maximum number of these datasets to be enriched in undifferentiated hescs, regardless of their putative functions. a subset of these genes was confirmed to be also expressed in hec cells and selected for rnai-mediated knock-down. we monitored the effects of these perturbations by morphological criteria as well as measurements of oct <dig>  nanog, and sox <dig> expression levels . the majority of knock-downs did not reveal apparent morphological changes and displayed normal mrna levels of the core transcription factors. this suggests that these genes do not have master regulatory roles in maintaining the undifferentiated state, while we cannot rule out insufficient silencing efficiencies as an alternative explanation for our observations in some cases . silencing of oct <dig> and sox <dig> produced apparent morphological changes in that cells treated with oct <dig> and sox <dig> esirna  <cit>  differentiated from 1– <dig> days post transfection.

the nanog knock-down, somewhat surprisingly, yielded a diminished proliferation phenotype . in contrast, in human es cells silencing of nanog has been shown to result in the loss of pluripotency  <cit> . to confirm the nanog rnai phenotype in our hec cells we employed a second esirna pool corresponding to a different region of the transcript. again, we observed a significant reduction in cellular proliferation . moreover, we did not observe this in any other knock-down performed, thus suggesting that the phenotype is specific. in contrast to the oct <dig> and sox <dig> rnai samples, cells treated with nanog esirna remained oct <dig> positive, as monitored by immunocytochemistry . western blot analysis showed that sox <dig> protein levels also remained unaffected in the nanog knock-down. in contrast, silencing of oct <dig> also caused strong down-regulation of sox <dig> and diminished nanog to levels below those in the nanog knock-down itself. likewise, silencing of sox <dig> caused substantial reduction of both oct <dig> and nanog protein . with the exception of the nanog knock-down these data are in agreement with the model of auto and reciprocal regulation between the three transcription factors  <cit> . to investigate whether the failure of nanog silencing in reducing oct <dig> and sox <dig> levels points at a bona fide biological difference between hec and hes cells or to a specific characteristic of the hec cell line used  <cit> , we employed a different batch of nccit cells . again, we observed somewhat reduced proliferation but no differentiation following the silencing of nanog, regardless if using a single esirna pool or a combination of esirnas  <dig> and  <dig> . in contrast, in lines 2102ep and ntera <dig> oct <dig> and sox <dig> levels were altered and cdx <dig>  a marker of trophoblast induction  <cit> , was up-regulated. however, while 2102ep cells completely differentiated towards a te-like phenotype with prominent nuclei, ntera <dig> cells only showed partial differentiation and modest induction of later trophoblast markers krt <dig>  <cit>  and hcg. hence, there appears to be heterogeneity between available hec cell lines, whereas the nanog rnai phenotype in hes cells may probably be best mimicked with the 2102ep line  <cit> . however, due to oct <dig> and sox <dig> levels being unchanged in the nanog knock-down , we reasoned that the nccit line may be best suited to reveal nanog-dependent genes on a global scale .

as a possible explanation for the failure of nccit cells to differentiate following the silencing of nanog, we considered that the nanog protein level in the rnai samples may still be sufficiently high to sustain self-renewal. this may seem likely given that chromosome  <dig>  is frequently amplified in hec cells as compared to karyotypically normal hes cells  <cit>  and because the nanog knock-down was incomplete . hence, nanog protein levels in esirna-treated and mock-transfected nccit cells were compared to that in undifferentiated hes cells grown in a chemically defined medium  <cit> . indeed, it appeared that nanog is substantially more abundant in nccit cells as compared to hes cells and that the level after knock-down is still in the range of that in self-renewing hes cells .

global expression analysis
to reveal the overall downstream effects of the individual perturbations, we performed whole genome expression analysis on a quantitative microarray platform  <cit> . using stringent filtering criteria revealed large numbers of differentially expressed genes which are presented as supplementary information . the numbers, as expected given the vast change in cellular identity , were higher in the oct <dig> and sox <dig> knock-downs. there were substantial overlaps between the sets of up- and down-regulated genes, in particular between the oct <dig> and sox <dig> knock-downs . consequenty, a comparison between the overall transcriptomes revealed that the oct <dig> and sox <dig> rnai samples were highly similar to each other, while the nanog knock-down was more closely related to the control cells . the non-overlapping parts regarding the oct <dig> and sox <dig> rnai samples  arose largely due to the arbitrary thresholds set to identify differential gene expression. for instance, most genes seemingly down-regulated exclusively in the oct <dig> knock-down were also down-regulated upon silencing of sox <dig>  albeit to a lesser extent  or the changes were statistically less significant. hence, the oct <dig> and sox <dig> rnai samples were more or less equivalent and could therefore serve as specificity controls for one another. this was also confirmed by real-time pcr for a subset of the differentially expressed genes . to address the issue of off-target effects  <cit>  in the nanog knock-down we additionally analysed rnai samples produced with an alternative esirna amplicon. this revealed a remarkable similarity between the independent rnai samples in that essentially the same genes were identified as being differentially expressed . an explanation for the reduction of off-target effects using pooled sirnas has been proposed  <cit> . in conclusion, the false positive rate of the data  is low. to test whether the expression changes measured using the microarrays are quantitative, we additionally determined the expression ratios of several nanog targets using real-time rt-pcr. this revealed a strong agreement between independent knock-downs using different esirnas and the two methods for transcript level quantification . this, together with data presented in additional file  <dig>  suggests that the microarray data are indeed quantitative.

expression of lineage-specific markers
the cells obtained after silencing of oct <dig> and sox <dig> had a flattened but overall undefined morphology accompanied by a reduction of cellular proliferation . to characterise the nature of the differentiated cells we investigated the expression of lineage-specific markers. suppression of oct <dig> activity in hes cells results in the up-regulation trophectodermal and primitive endoderm markers  <cit> . similarly, several, but not all, hec cell lines have been shown by pcr to up-regulate markers of the trophoblast lineage following oct <dig> knock-down  <cit> . we did not detect trophoblast-specifying genes such as cdx <dig> in the oct <dig> rnai samples, by means of microarrays. to confirm this, we used real-time pcr as a more sensitive means of quantifying changes in gene expression, employing two different batches of nccit cells as well as other hec cell lines. in 2102ep and, somewhat surprisingly  <cit> , ntera <dig> cells, silencing of oct <dig> lead to the up-regulation of all trophoblast differentiation markers tested . however, the nccit cells only showed a transient induction of cdx <dig> and krt <dig> at day  <dig> but no significant induction of the later marker hcg at day  <dig> . hence, the nccit cells did not differentiate to trophoblast following oct <dig> knock-down.

instead, from a collection of marker gene expression data, it was evident that they have mesodermal characteristics. for instance, we observed strong induction of regulators such as msx <dig>  hand <dig>  and runx <dig>  morphogens , smooth muscle and cardiac actin, as well as mesoderm-specific collagens. notably, most of these markers were not up-regulated in the nanog knock-down, consistent with its undifferentiated phenotype. in contrast, virtually no endodermal and ectodermal marker genes were induced . since the original nccit cells had been shown to be capable of extraembryonic differentiation  <cit> , the failure to continuously up-regulate trophectodermal markers may be due to a partial loss of developmental potential at some point in the past. alternatively, it may be a cell type-specific effect. interestingly, there are indications that trophoblast and mesodermal differentiation programmes may be somewhat related in that they involve at least some shared players. for instance, the transcription factor eomes is expressed in both lineages and required for their specification  <cit> . also, hand <dig> has been implicated in trophoblast differentiation as well as in extraembryonic mesoderm and cardiac development  <cit> . moreover, while bone morphogenic proteins are known inducers of mesodermal gene expression in different systems including hec cells  <cit> , bmp <dig> in particular has also been shown to promote trophoblast differentiation of hes cells  <cit> . we therefore speculate that the mesoderm-like differentiation in nccit cells may be a default fate aquired upon oct <dig> ablation, possibly mediated by the induction of bmps that could otherwise be interpreted as trophoblast-inducing signals .

with the exception of lhx <dig>  bmp <dig>  and hand <dig>  none of the genes was expressed at detectable levels in mock-treated hec cell cultures. we did not investigate whether t was transiently up-regulated during cellular differentiation. for the calculation of expression ratios reference intensities were arbitrarily set to the level of threshold expression. n/a denotes insignificant expression also in the rnai samples. * and ** indicate statistical significance of the expression changes .

downstream targets of oct <dig>  nanog, and sox <dig> in heccs
clearly, the large numbers of differentially expressed genes following oct <dig>  nanog, and sox <dig> rnai  are only in part directly regulated by these factors. to reveal which of the differentially expressed genes may be putative direct targets we made use of the chip-chip dataset by boyer et al.  <cit>  which is based on hes cells. overall, there was a substantial overlap between the different datasets, which, however, was reduced when applying high-stringency filtering criteria for differential expression to our rnai-chip data . for instance, of the  <dig> genes down-regulated upon silencing of nanog,  <dig> are direct targets in hes cells, based on the boyer dataset. significantly, most of these were also down-regulated in the oct <dig> and sox <dig> knock-downs, as expected, because in these samples nanog was diminished, as well . these genes are therefore likely to be nanog targets directly activated both in undifferentiated hes and hec cells. examples include genes preferentially expressed in hes cells  <cit>  such as dppa <dig>  gdf <dig>  hesx <dig>  prdm <dig>  terf <dig>  zic <dig>  and znf <dig> . some of these as well as genes indirectly down-regulated in all three knock-downs  were part of our initial screen . the fact that these genes were also down-regulated in the nanog rnai samples, which did not show any signs of differentiation, might explain why their silencing did not result in a loss of the undifferentiated state and, hence, they may not be absolutely required for self-renewal. therefore, in the context of hes and hec self-renewal, genes down-regulated in the oct <dig> and sox <dig> but not in the nanog knock-downs are of utmost interest . this set comprises  <dig> genes directly regulated by either of the three tfs. many of these as well as indirectly affected genes are also markers of undifferentiated es cells. examples include aass, dppa <dig> , flj <dig>  foxo1a, lin <dig>  pou5f <dig>  itself, sox <dig>  sox <dig>  stat <dig>  <cit> , tdgf <dig>  trim <dig>  zic <dig>  znf <dig>  and, interestingly, kruppel-like factor  <dig> . klf <dig> has recently been implicated in reprogramming fibroblasts to an es cell-like state, in conjuction with oct <dig>  sox <dig>  and c-myc  <cit> . hence, the orthologue klf <dig> may play an important role in hec and hes cells, as well. the mrna level of myc, though expressed in hec and hes cells, did not change significantly in the oct <dig> and sox <dig> knock-downs . another gene, esrrb , has recently been identified as a key regulator in mouse es cells by two independent studies  <cit> . however, based on our array data, the expression of the orthologue esrrb was below detectable levels both in hec and hes cells.

ratios >  <dig>  or <  <dig>  are in bold. in essentially all cases, these changes were also statistically significant. hesc chip-chip data were taken from  <cit> . the last column  indicates enriched gene expression in hes cells. sox <dig> was below detection on the arrays but monitored by real-time pcr . see additional file  <dig> for additional confirmations.

furthermore, the genes down-regulated in the oct <dig> and sox <dig> but not in the nanog rnai samples comprised between ca.  <dig> to  <dig> histones. depending on the thresholds for expression ratio and statistical significance, many of these are direct  targets in hes cells, according to boyer et al.  <cit>  . in addition, we noticed that histone acetylases  as well as the swi/snf family member smarca <dig> were down-regulated and histone deacetylases  were induced. besides the transcriptional control by tfs, these findings strongly suggest modification of chromatin structure as an additional mechanism to drive/accompany the transition from undifferentiated towards differentiated cell identity  <cit> . this is in agreement with the current model of chromatin states in es vs. differentiated cells  <cit>  and, maybe, with the discovery of hyperdynamic structural chromatin protein in undifferentiated es and ec cells  <cit> . we also found the polycomb group genes phc <dig>  and phc <dig>  to be differentially expressed in the oct <dig> and sox <dig> knock-downs. however, a comparison of our rnai-chip data to prc <dig> downstream targets in mouse es cells  <cit>  would go beyond the scope of this report and be too speculative at this point.

to further categorise the differentially expressed genes, with an emphasis on the oct <dig> and sox <dig> rnai datasets, we mapped these to gene ontology terms  <cit> . as can be inferred from table  <dig>  the genes up-regulated after ablation of the core tfs were preferentially involved in intracellular signaling, differentiation, cytoskeletal organisation, apoptosis, wnt pathway activation, cell cycle arrest, and cell adhesion/generation of extracellular matrix. these are all processes that one may predict to result from the extinction of self-renewal activity. moreover, many induced genes are known to be involved in the generation of mesodermal cell types, confirming the analysis of marker gene expression . finally, transcription factors were enriched in the up-regulated gene sets indicating that these are repressed in the undifferentiated state and hence, may be involved in triggering the differentiation process or in maintaining the differentiated cell state. some of them are known to be involved in lineage specification . a large fraction was presented by homeobox-containing tfs many of which appear to be directly repressed by oct <dig>  nanog, and/or sox <dig> in hes cells  <cit>  .

p values from the david  <cit>  output are a measure for the enrichment of the individual go terms in the lists of up  and down-regulated  genes.

in contrast, go terms associated with the loss of self-renewal reflected typical es/ec cell properties, namely high rates of primary metabolism , cell cycle, atp consumption, and protein biosynthesis . the differential expression of genes involved in chromatin remodeling has been discussed above. however, the down-regulation of large numbers of histone genes might additionally be interpreted as simply reflecting the overall reduction of cell division. on the other hand, we did not see this tendency in the nanog rnai samples which also displayed reduced proliferation rates. the nanog phenotype  is likely a result of a reduction in metabolic and cell cycle activity rather than from the induction of apoptosis, as suggested by go and kegg pathway analyses . of interest in this context may also be the significant down-regulation of utf <dig> in the nanog knock-down  since the mouse orthologue has been implicated in es cell proliferation  <cit>  and revealed to be a direct nanog target  <cit> .

putative receptor-mediated signaling in hec cells
to investigate whether there may be signaling pathways operative in maintaining the undifferentiated state of hec cells, we mapped the sets of genes differentially expressed in the oct <dig> and sox <dig> knock-downs to known pathways  <cit> . we noticed that components of the tgfβ pathway were preferentially up-regulated upon differentiation . these included bmp <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  grem <dig>  tgfb <dig> and  <dig>  smad <dig> and  <dig>  and – strikingly – lefta . nodal and the antagonists lefta and b are expressed in hes cells and rapidly down-regulated upon differentiation  <cit> . in addition to nodal  <cit> , tgfβ <dig> and activin a have been shown to support self-renewal of hes cells, by activating smad 2/ <dig>  <cit> . however, the corresponding genes are not or only weakly expressed in hec cells  and, moreover, we failed to amplify the smad binding partner foxh <dig> from hec cdna . these findings argue against a contribution of tgfβ signaling to self-renewal of nccit hec cells, in contrast to the situation in hes cells when grown in serum replacement-based medium. further investigation is required to test this hypothesis.

nevertheless, there may also be similarities between hes and hec cells with regards to  receptor-mediated signaling. for instance, we noticed that  <dig> genes encoding gaba receptor components were down-regulated upon differentiation . this is noteworthy because for example, gabrb <dig>  is also enriched hescs  <cit>  and gaba as well as pipecolic acid have recently been found to support the undifferentiated growth of these cells  <cit> .

moreover, we noticed that genes encoding mapk-activating proteins were significantly down-regulated . interestingly, these included fibroblast growth factors and fgf receptors. in addition, sprouty genes which encode modulators of fgf/mapk signaling induced by fgfs themselves  <cit>  were repressed as well. in contrast, fgfrl <dig>  encoding an fgf receptor devoid of an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and therefore a putative inhibitor of fgf signaling, was strongly induced . to test whether fgf signaling is required for self-renewal of nccit cells, we cultured these in the presence and absence of a potent inhibitor of fgf receptors  <cit> . after one day of su <dig> treatment, the cells showed a reduction in growth rates and began to differentiate. after  <dig> days, the cells had essentially ceased to proliferate and were largely differentiated as monitored by oct <dig> immunostaining . to rule out that these observations were specific to the nccit cells we employed two other hec lines and obtained essentially the same results . oct <dig>  nanog, and sox <dig> levels were monitored by real-time pcr, which confirmed the loss of the undifferentiated state in all three cell lines. these data strongly supports the notion that fgf signaling is a general requirement for self-renewal of hec cells. this is likely to happen in an autocrine manner since fetal calf serum contained in the culture medium does not contain fgfs or, at least, fgf <dig>  <cit> . a speculative hypothesis is that autocrine signaling provides an explanation for the fact that several hec lines need to be cultured at high densities to prevent their spontaneous differentiation  <cit> .

interestingly, autocrine fgf signaling has also been shown to be crucial in human es cells  <cit>  and these also express fgf <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> which are down-regulated upon induction of differentiation  <cit> . while other pathways may as well be fgf-dependent in hes cells, fgf <dig> has been shown to activate the erk/mapk signaling cascade  <cit> . to test whether this is also the case in hec cells, we monitored mapk phosphorylation  <dig> minutes after su <dig> treatment. indeed, mapk was active in the control cells and its phosphorylation was abolished upon fgf receptor inhibition, as predicted .

CONCLUSIONS
overall, our data highlights the similarities between human ec and es cells and further supports the idea that pluripotent human stem cells share a number of characteristics in the context of maintaining their cellular identity. this applies for the overall downstream targets of core transcription factors as well as for the requirement of autocrine fgf signaling. however, differences appear to exist with regards to the expression of tgfβ pathway genes.
