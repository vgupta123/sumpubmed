BACKGROUND
the thylakoid system in plants is organized into two distinct domains: grana arranged in stacks of appressed membranes and non-appressed membranes consisting of stroma thylakoids and margins of granal stacks 
 <cit> . it is known that appressed membranes that form grana are not essential for photosynthesis but they are ubiquitous in all chlorophyll  b-containing higher plants 
 <cit> . many photosynthetic organisms such as red algae, cyanobacteria, many green algae such as chlamydomonas reinhardtii have no stacked thylakoids. apart from higher plants only charophyta have appressed membranes indistinguishable from those of land plants 
 <cit> .

why did plants develop grana? the development of appressed membranes caused structural heterogeneity that is reflected by functional differentiation with respect to the location of hierarchically organized photosyntetic complexes in supercomplexes and megacomplexes within appressed and non-appressed membranes 
 <cit> . size and charge differences between psi and psii play a key role in their lateral arrangement 
 <cit> . photosynthetic unit psiiα, i.e., lhcii-psii supercomplex occurs exclusively in appressed regions and is composed of the dimer of the psii core, minor light-harvesting complexes  and variable amounts of lhcii trimers  
 <cit> . in non-appressed thylakoid regions the monomeric psi core complex with four lhci subunits  and with temporarily bound lhcii complex form lhci-psi supercomplexes 
 <cit> . in addition the photosynthetic unit psiiβ, i.e. monomeric psii without lhcii trimers, exists in stroma thylakoids 
 <cit> . the structural and organizational changes of grana stacks are driven by physical and chemical forces. it is believed that membrane appression is maintained primarily by the balance between the van der waals attraction versus electrostatic and hydratation repulsion 
 <cit> .

it is argued that the reason for the development of appressed membranes in plants is that their photosynthetic apparatus needs to cope with and survive ever-changing environmental conditions, such as transition from darkness, low-light to high-light conditions 
 <cit>  or temperature fluctuation 
 <cit> . short-term changes are due to the redistribution of absorbed excitation energy  that is based on migration of lhcii from psii after its phosphorylation 
 <cit> . tightly appressed arrangement of thylakoid membranes results in high stability of the chloroplast structure, which needs to be somehow combined with high flexibility/adaptability to dynamically changing environmental conditions 
 <cit> .

why do different plant species have different arrangements of grana within their chloroplasts? examinations of mutants yielded some information on the arrangement of thylakoid membranes within chloroplasts. for example it is known that arabidopsis aba mutants – deficient in epoxy-carotenoids – have significantly more grana stacks per chloroplast and more chloroplasts per cell but reduced thylakoid stacking in comparison with wild arabidopsis plants 
 <cit> . in tobacco knockdown of psbp protein, one of the three oxygen evolving complex proteins in plants, impairs the accumulation of psii supercomplexes in tobacco and causes large disorder in the thylakoid grana stacking 
 <cit> . studies of the arrangements of thylakoid membranes gave information on chlorophyll b –less arabidopsis mutants. markedly decreased level or the absence of most of lhcbs caused fewer grana and much longer stromal thylakoids than in the wild type which implied that the total granal cross-sectional area per chloroplast area was decreased dramatically 
 <cit> . ruban and coworkers 
 <cit>  argued that in the absence of one of the psii supercomplex main components, another antenna protein may be recruited to replace a mutated or absent protein, therefore allowing the main complex to assemble and function correctly.

mutations in the photosynthetic apparatus that cause changes in the thylakoid arrangement give an altered picture of chloroplast thylakoid membranes with profound effect on the photosynthetic efficiency and capacity 
 <cit> . data on the thylakoid arrangement in chloroplasts of different plant species grown in natural or varying environmental conditions, can supplement information obtained for the mutants. thus answering a question whether and how structural heterogeneity at different levels of thylakoid organization can relate to adaptation/acclimation to changing environment and better photosynthetic efficiency is of significant importance.

in this paper we propose possible interpretation at molecular level of different arrangements of the thylakoid membranes of pea  and bean  grown under similar controlled conditions, as a continuation of our previous studies 
 <cit> . here we compared different chloroplast structures by confocal laser scanning microscopy  followed by computer modeling and by transmission electron microscopy . the arrangement and composition of chlorophyll-protein  complexes were examined by mild-denaturing electrophoresis, sds-page, tandem mass spectrometry , immunodetection and by low-temperature steady-state spectrophotometry. additionally psii activity was analyzed by modulated and transient chl a fluorescence.

by applying these diverse methodologies we attempted to describe the relationship between spatial chloroplast structure detected by clsm in situ and the arrangements of cp complexes within the thylakoid membranes. our aim was to determine at the molecular level, whether different arrangement and distribution of appressed and non-appressed thylakoids in chloroplasts are linked with different qualitative and/or quantitative organization of cp complexes in the thylakoid membranes and whether it influences the photosynthetic efficiency.

RESULTS
clsm images and three dimensional  reconstruction of chloroplast structure
clsm images revealed fluorescent red spots of about  <dig>  μm separated from one another by dark spaces inside pea chloroplasts . as it was demonstrated by others 
 <cit>  these bright spots reflected mainly appressed thylakoid membranes containing lhcii-psii supercomplexes and lhcii trimers rather than non-appressed thylakoids containing psi. in bean chloroplasts  smaller and less distinguished fluorescent discs were observed .

large number  of fluorescence images were taken in different focal depths. this allowed creating computer-generated 3d structures in which the spatial layout of chl fluorescence was shown . in pea chloroplasts, the spatial layout of chl fluorescence consisted of distinguished sharply falling down edges forming deep, curved gorges corresponding to the dark areas in clsm images . the surface of chl fluorescence areas is seen in the face view as well as in the side view. 3d images of bean chloroplasts were less regular, with edges not as sharp as in pea, resulting in shallow, irregular caves corresponding to the dark, non-fluorescent areas between the red bodies observed by clsm . in each 3d structure one can find a corresponding detail of the clsm image. for a better view of chloroplast 3d structures, animated models are included in additional file 
1: video s <dig> and additional file 
2: video s <dig>  the 3d structures reflect the distribution of chl fluorescence in a chloroplast as a whole.

tem chloroplast structure in mesophyll cells
images of pea chloroplasts of leaf mesophyll from tem showed large appressed thylakoid regions , clearly separated from one another by non-appressed ones and oriented paralelly to one another . these large appressed thylakoids in pea chloroplasts  correspond to large, uniformly distributed red fluorescent  <dig>  μm bodies seen by clsm . bean chloroplasts contain numerous non-appressed thylakoid regions with some appressed ones which are smaller than those in pea thylakoids and are irregularly distributed within chloroplasts . these appressed regions in tem images of bean chloroplasts are counterparts of smaller and less distinguished fluorescent areas seen by clsm .

the average value of the ratio of the length of grana thylakoids to the length of stroma thylakoids was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  in pea while in bean it was only  <dig>  ±  <dig> . the average height ratio of a granum to the number of thylakoids in a particular granum was also bigger in pea  than in bean chloroplasts . the distance between the pairs of membranes in thylakoids was estimated to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm in pea and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm in bean chloroplasts. this reflected a relatively larger thylakoid lumen in pea thylakoids  compared with bean thylakoids . the chloroplast images from intact chloroplasts by clsm and from leaf tissue in situ by tem were consistent with each other and gave similar information regarding different distribution and appearance of appressed and non-appressed thylakoids in pea and bean chloroplasts.

protein composition
separation of thylakoid membrane components by sds-page in linear gradient gels  resulted in a very high resolution of individual proteins from both pea and bean. more than  <dig> proteins from  <dig> to  <dig> kd in molecular weight were distinguishable . the thylakoid membrane proteins in 15– <dig> kd molecular weight range are presented in figure 
 <dig>  following electrophoretic separation the proteins of interest were identified by immunodetection and ms/ms analysis.

electrophoretic pattern was similar in pea and bean thylakoid samples and proteins psba, psbb, psbc, psbd, psbo, lhca1- <dig> and lhcb1- <dig> were identified in both samples . however significant compositional differences were observed in the gel area where the antennae proteins  were localized . ten bands in pea  and  <dig> bands in bean samples  were distinguished in this region. moreover, pea and bean lhca <dig>  lhca <dig>  lhca <dig>  lhcb <dig> and lhcb <dig> polypeptides were found in several bands . the main qualitative differences between the pea and bean antennae proteins concern a number of isoforms of lhca1- <dig> and their molecular weights .

the relative amounts of psii and psi antennae and the core proteins compared to the total chl  amount were determined by immunodetection with specific antibodies . for more accurate estimation each sample was examined at four different chlorophyll concentrations . quantitative relationships between the two samples were expressed as a ratio of pixel intensities corresponding to selected proteins bands normalized to chlorophyll content. lhcb <dig> was detected as one major band in pea and one major and two minor bands in bean samples. the presence of these two additional bands in bean sample is probably an effect of anti- lhcb <dig> antibody cross interactivity with the lhcb <dig>  and the lhcb <dig>  proteins . because of apparent low antibody specificity against bean lhcb <dig>  quantitative analysis was performed only for the major band which was about 30 % more abundant in bean than in pea. on the other hand the level of psba in bean was about two times higher than in pea, which suggests a higher ratio of lhcb <dig> to psba in pea thylakoids. the lhca <dig> detection pattern consisted of one dominant and three  or six  minor bands with higher molecular weight. these additional bands may correspond to different isoforms of lhca <dig> 
 <cit> , . there was no difference between the levels of lhca <dig> main band in pea and bean samples but pea/bean ratio for all detected lhca <dig> bands indicated lower contents in pea, which can be explained by a difference in detected isoforms. psaa, the psi core protein, was detected as 55– <dig> kd band whereas expected molecular weight for this protein is around  <dig> kd 
 <cit> . the psaa level in pea thylakoids is similar to bean up to the standard deviation.

the chl a/chl b ratios were the same in pea and bean thylakoids , hence the detected differences in antenna/core protein ratios are likely to be related to protein proportion within the thylakoid membranes. comparison of lhca <dig> and psaa ratios suggests that the amounts of lhci-psi were similar in the thylakoids of both species. due to statistically significant difference in lhcb <dig> and psba ratios we can explicitly conclude that the proportion of psii antennae to the core proteins was higher in pea than in bean thylakoids. however unambiguous estimation of psii-lhcii abundance was more complicated because:  part of lhcii might be arranged in an aggregated form,  from two up to six lhcii trimers might be associated with a psii dimer and  psba protein is partially localized in psii monomers which are not connected to lhcii antennae 
 <cit> . therefore the mild-denaturing electrophoresis and 77 k fluorescence spectra were performed for detail analysis.

the chlorophyll-protein complexes composition
the chlorophyll-protein complexes were gently released from the membranes by n-decyl-β-d-maltopyranoside and n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, and separated by mild-denaturing ‘green’ gel electrophoresis. the separation of pea and bean thylakoids revealed  <dig> green bands assigned to ten different cp complexes  . according to allen and staehelin 
 <cit> , cp1-cp <dig> bands correspond to lhci-psi and lhcii-psii supercomplexes. cp <dig> corresponds to reaction center complexes and includes psi and psii complexes without external antennae system attached. band cp <dig> is assigned to lhcii supercomplexes. cp8-cp <dig> bands correspond to monomers . the pea and bean complexes differed in the electrophoretic mobility of their components, especially of cp <dig> to cp <dig> that appeared to have higher molecular weights in pea thylakoids.

immunodetection analysis of psbd , psaa, lhcb1- <dig> and lhca1- <dig> proteins with specific antibodies was performed to study the polypeptide composition of the chlorophyll-protein complexes . generally all those proteins, except for lhcb <dig>  lhcb <dig>  lhcb <dig>  were found in pea and bean thylakoids in cp <dig> to cp <dig> bands . it supports statement that the cp1-cp <dig> bands could contain lhci-psi and lhcii-psii supercomplexes. immunodetection of d <dig>  psaa, lhca <dig>  lhca <dig> within pea cp <dig> band was low and even lower in bean cp <dig>  in the cp <dig> band d <dig>  psaa and lhcb <dig> were detected in pea but only d <dig> in bean. in cp <dig> mainly lhcb <dig> and lhcb <dig> were detected in pea and bean; and it is well known that these two proteins build functional lhcii supercomplexes. in this band a weak detection of d <dig>  psaa, lhca <dig> in pea and d <dig> and lhca <dig> in bean was observed. in the monomer region  many of individual proteins were resolved.

quantitative analysis of mild-denaturing electrophoresis pattern showed significant differences in chlorophyll-protein complexes isolated from pea and bean leaves. the amount of cp <dig> and cp <dig> containing lhci-psi and lhcii-psii supercomplexes was considerably lower in pea than in bean thylakoids . moreover, the proportion of cp <dig> assigned to lhcii complexes was higher in pea than in bean . because the mild-denaturing electrophoresis did not preserve completely the cp supercomplexes structure 
 <cit> , the presented results illustrate the stability of distinct cp complexes after the detergent treatment rather than its native organization in thylakoid membranes. thus, the intensity of cp <dig> bands  is related to lhcii associated loosely or strongly with lhcii-psii supercomplexes and also with lhcii which is not directly associated with psii. thus this indicates again that the intensities of cp <dig> and cp <dig> bands  are a consequence of its stability, probably due to restricted detergent accessibility to the cp complexes.

analysis of the relative composition of the pea and bean thylakoid membranes by low-temperature spectrophotometry
in order to determine the relative contribution of specific complexes to the overall fluorescence pattern in thylakoids isolated from pea and bean leaves, the steady-state fluorescence emission spectra at 77 k were normalized to the same area  under the spectrum . the cp core complexes bind chl a only 
 <cit> . the chl a/b ratio in lhci was estimated to about  <dig>  
 <cit> , while in lhcii trimers only to about  <dig>  
 <cit> . this indicates that the fluorescence emission excited at 412 nm originated mainly from the psi and psii core complexes and only slightly from antenna complexes. on the other hand the emission from lhcii increases significantly under the excitation at 470 nm and therefore the fluorescence may be related to the abundance of this complex. the spectra of both species exhibited a common maxima at around 682 nm, 695 nm  and 733 nm. however, the ratio between these main bands in pea and bean spectra is different . the thylakoid emission spectrum is highly heterogeneous and might be resolved in some partially overlapping emission bands corresponding to specific cp complexes 
 <cit> . the best gaussian fit to fluorescence spectra enable to distinguish five components . the bands at around  <dig> originated from both trimers and monomers of lhcii and cp <dig> intrinsic antenna of psii 
 <cit> . the bands at  <dig> correspond to emission from the psii core and to cp <dig> intrinsic antenna 
 <cit> . aggregated forms of lhcii, disconnected from psii reaction centers show an additional band at 703 nm. two bands in the far red emission region at 734 nm and 753 nm are related to the core and antenna of psi respectively. thus, integrated intensities of the individual bands at  <dig> and 695 nm correspond to lhcii-psii, while both of fluorescence bands at  <dig> and  <dig> were related to lhci-psi complexes.

in the spectra excited at 412 nm  the psi-lhci to psii-lhcii emission ratio was slightly lower in pea  than in bean  thylakoids. since most of chl a is bound to core complexes, these data indicate a similar proportion between psi and psii core complexes in both species. under the excitation at 470 nm  the ratio of  to  decreased significantly in pea  but not in bean . furthermore, the ratio f681/f <dig> following excitations at  <dig> and 470 nm increases from  <dig>  to  <dig>  in pea, whereas is stable in bean . because most of chl b is located in lhcii 
 <cit> , it is suggested that higher abundance of lhcii connected with psii exists in pea than in bean thylakoids. similar conclusions may be drawn from the pea minus bean differences spectra , where positive band at around 680 nm attributed to the lhcii complexes 
 <cit>  is observed.

the difference pea - minus - bean spectrum  of the normalized fluorescence emission spectra exhibited a negative band around 700 nm attributed to the emission from multiaggregated forms of lhcii disconnected from the psii reaction centers 
 <cit> , suggesting a larger concentration of these complexes in bean. furthermore, the emission difference spectrum showed a positive band at around 720 nm and a broad negative band at around 750 nm , corresponding to the core complex and the antennae of psi 
 <cit> . these data indicate distinct differences in the lhci-psi structure between the two species; probably due to the presence of a number of lhca1- <dig> isoforms .

steady-state electron absorption spectra revealed the properties of pigments bound in cp complexes 
 <cit> . the analysis of relative contributions of individual bands in one minus transmission spectra  at 120 k, normalized to the same area  under the spectrum, was performed for pea and bean thylakoids . pea thylakoids spectrum showed maxima at 437 nm , 473 nm  as well as at 678 nm , whereas the bean thylakoids spectrum revealed red-shifted bands for chl a , but not for chl b  . the difference absorption spectra of pea thylakoid membranes relative to those of bean thylakoids , exhibited positive bands at soret and qy regions broad negative bands around  <dig> and 720 nm .

normalized excitation spectra presented the relative energy transfer from the absorbing pigments to the emitting chl species reflecting the state of cp complexes 
 <cit> . the spectra at 120 k  of pea and bean thylakoids revealed typical excitation bands in the soret region  due to light-harvesting by chl a , chl b , and carotenoid pigments, as well as bands in the red wavelengths solely due to the excitation of chl a  and chl b  . difference excitation spectra between respective pea and bean spectra centered at  <dig> or 735 nm showed significant positive bands at around  <dig>   <dig> and 490 nm in the soret region and at qy bands of chl a .

the shape of main bands in the absorbance and excitation spectra  indicates that they are not affected by the light scattering effect in the soret and chlorophyll q regions 
 <cit> . thus, positive bands in the excitation difference spectra  suggest a more efficient energy transfer from the antennae complexes to both chl species emitting at  <dig>  and 735 nm  in pea than in bean thylakoids, probably due to much higher ratio of lhcii to the psii core . on the other hand, the wide negative bands, present only in the difference absorption spectrum , are related to light scattering and sieve effects 
 <cit> , probably due to a less regular structure of bean thylakoids .

analysis of psii functioning based on chl a fluorescence
the psii photochemistry in vivo was tested by measuring the initial  and maximum fluorescence  values in dark-adapted pea and bean leaves . the intensities of chl a fluorescence with open reaction centers  were similar in both species, and with closed reaction centers  were slightly higher in pea compared with bean leaves. the absolute values of these parameters can be influenced by optical properties of the leaf. thus were calculated the variable fluorescence values , that reflect the psii photochemistry indicated by the redox state of qa, and the fv/fm ratio, that informs about the maximum quantum yield of psii in the dark-adapted state. the fv/fm ratio did not differ significantly between the two species , indicating the optimization of electron transport and metabolic processes in both plants.

the photochemical quenching coefficient , the psii efficiency factor, which is non-linearly related to the proportion of open psii centers  at a given light intensity 
 <cit> , increased similarly in relation to time of illumination . the maximum qp values for pea and bean leaves, reached at saturating light conditions, were estimated at  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

the non-photochemical quenching parameter , reflecting the apparent rate constant for non-radiative energy dissipation from psii and its antennae, revealed a slightly different shape in relation to illumination time . the maximum qn values for pea and bean leaves were estimated at  <dig>  and  <dig>  after five and four consecutive flashes, respectively. moreover, despite the fact that qn under saturated light conditions was high , the qn declined slower in pea than in bean.

the polyphasic fluorescence rises in a time domain from 10 μs to 1 s from its origin  to its peak . the rise has been interpreted, under the strict assumption that photoelectrochemical and photoelectrical events are not involved or ineffective, to reflect the successive filling up of the psii primary and secondary electron acceptors  
 <cit> . different inflection points of the fluorescence curve have been suggested to correspond to: j –the peak concentrations of qa qb- and qa- qb-, i - the concentration change of qa- qb2- and p – the peak concentrations of qa- qb2- and pqh <dig> <cit> . this conceptually means, within this concept, that all reaction centers are open at o and all are closed at p, if the light pulses are saturating . the basic pattern for fluorescence kinetics holds for all plants. however, the actual pattern depends, again within the concept, on the number of psii structural and functional features, such as, the state of water oxidation complex or the redox state of the intersystem electron transport chain 
 <cit> . presented description of fluorescence induction curve distinguished a dip phase  between the j and i level and is denoted by the so-called ojdip rise 
 <cit> . the chl a fluorescence transients of the dark-adapted leaves of pea and bean are shown on the logarithmic scale from 10 μs up to 1 s . both curves show the typical ojdip shape . after normalization to f0 =  <dig>  the difference between both curves becomes apparent:  the j-,  and p-levels are somewhat higher in the bean leaf,  the dip  is a little more pronounced in pea, and  the steepness of d-i phase is different in both leaf types.

the alternative interpretation of polyphasic ojdip curve is that the subsequent kinetic phases are associated with the release of photochemical  and photoelectrochemical quenching  and of photoelectrical stimulation , respectively 
 <cit> . application of the fluorescence induction algorithm  to both experimental curves enables the estimation, illustration and comparison of the respective responses of photochemical , photoelectrochemical  and photoelectrical  processes occurring in these time domains .

release of the photochemical quenching, fpp, which is the major contributor of the variable fluorescence fv in the o-j-phase , is associated with about equal maximal variable fluorescence fv/f <dig> of  <dig>  and  <dig>  in bean and pea, respectively. initial fv kinetics are sigmoidal, indicating equal effect of donor side quenching in both species. the rate of fv is slightly faster in pea, probably due to a somewhat higher antenna size as compared to bean leaves. the release of photoelectrochemical quenching, fpe, which is the major contributor of the variable fluorescence fv in the j-i-phase , is reflected by a maximal variable fluorescence fv/f0 ~  <dig>  in both species. the rise kinetics are distinctly different: in bean with nearly exponential kinetics, in pea with a delayed and steeper rise pattern. the photo-electrical stimulation fcet causing the final  phase of the variable fluorescence fv with maximal fv/f0 ~  <dig>  and  <dig>  in bean and pea, respectively, occurs with a delay of approximately 50 ms and a steep rise . the delay and the steepness of fcet is somewhat higher in pea. it has been concluded from the fia-model 
 <cit>  that an increase in delay and steepness of the fluorescence response during the i-p-phase points to a higher proton buffering capacity at the lumenal side of the cet-driven proton pump. a relation with the size of the granum stack, higher in pea, is suggestive in this respect.

discussion
the diversity of chloroplasts membrane system into appressed  thylakoids and interconnected non-appressed  thylakoids is generally described as a consequence of physicochemical interactions between the neighbouring membranes and steric differences between photosystems 
 <cit> . however, complete model of thylakoid membrane network is still under discussion 
 <cit> . furthermore, it is not clear what can be the reason of specific arrangements of the thylakoid membranes in various plant species. our results from clsm and tem  strongly indicate the existence of different arrangements of pea and bean thylakoid membranes. in pea, we showed by clsm that larger appressed thylakoids are regularly arranged within chloroplasts as uniformly distributed red fluorescent bodies. in contrast, irregularly distributed appressed thylakoid membrane within bean chloroplasts corresponded to smaller and less distinguished fluorescent areas in clsm images. recent investigations on selective localization of psi and psii fluorescence within chloroplast in situ by hasegawa et al. <cit>  demonstrated that the regions of respective fluorescence areas are separated from each other but a significant amount of psi emission is merged with psii fluorescence. this means that in our clsm images  lhci-psi complex might be localized in both dark and red areas, but the lhcii-psii and lhcii trimers are exclusively restricted to the glowing red bodies.

3d models of pea chloroplast show a distinct and sharp spatial separation of stacked thylakoids from large stromal spaces . the spatial division of a stroma and thylakoids areas in bean chloroplast is more complicated; stroma spaces are smaller and very irregular . the spatial layout of chl fluorescence forms areas that differ in size and spatial orientation , especially in bean chloroplast, where merging of grana and stroma thylakoids is observed . these 3d models indicate that the spatial arrangement of the thylakoid membranes within chloroplast is more heterogenous, unordered and more diverse between species than could be concluded from single cross-section observed by tem 
 <cit> .

the role of lhcii complexes in formation of grana based on investigation of mutants and shade grown plants have been proposed many years ago 
 <cit> . the increase of lhcii abundance in thylakoids or its polyaminylation lead to enhancement of the thylakoid stacking due to the increase of the van der waals attractive force between the adjacent thylakoid membranes 
 <cit> . the decrease in the content of one or more lhcbs proteins leads to the increase of the thylakoids disorder due to the increase of electrostatic and hydratation repulsion 
 <cit> . furthermore, recent detailed investigations demonstrated that all six lhcb proteins 
 <cit>  as well as psbp and psbq polypeptides of oxygen evolving complex 
 <cit>  play significant role in the stabilization of lhcii-psii supercomplexes.

therefore, to find correlation between the protein composition and the arrangement of pea and bean thylakoids we performed qualitative and quantitative analysis of lhc and the core proteins as well as the chlorophyll-protein complexes. the immunodetection and ms/ms analysis enabled the identification of seventeen lhcbs polypeptides in thylakoids of pea and bean . the estimated molecular weights of the lhcb proteins were similar in pea and bean, but a significant difference in the number and molecular weight of lhca1- <dig> isoforms was found . these observations might indicate that a number of diverse populations of the lhci-psi complexes exist both in pea and bean thylakoids. the relative quantitative immunodetection analysis of the selected antennae and the core proteins performed with reference to the total chl content  provides further evidence that the ratio of the lhcii antennae  to the psii core  proteins is higher in pea than in bean thylakoids. these data indicate that the diversity in pea and bean chloroplasts ultrastructure  might result from different quantitative and/or qualitative protein composition . however, this correlation is probably more complicated due to a complex hierarchical architecture of thylakoids 
 <cit> .

the basic unit of lhcii-psii consists of the dimeric form of psii, two copies of monomeric antennae  and two lhcii trimers containing lhcb <dig> and lhcb <dig> proteins  
 <cit> . c2s2m <dig> supercomplex was formed by incorporation of two lhcb <dig> and two further trimers 
 <cit> . moreover, up to six lhcii trimers might be associated with psii dimer  and the aggregates of lhcii trimers n are detected in grana thylakoids. c2s2m <dig> supercomplexes are associated in different types of megacomplexes dependent on plant species 
 <cit> . furthermore, c2s <dig> together with lhcii is arranged in stacked thylakoids both in random and in ordered arrangements 
 <cit> . moreover, the increased of psii antenna size and membrane numbers in granum as well as formation of semicrystalline lhcii-psii arrays are observed in low-light grown plants 
 <cit> . the lhci-psi complexes in unstacked regions of membranes might bound the lhcii trimers, creating new supercomplexes, but its association in megacomplexes is not established yet 
 <cit> .

allen and staehelin 
 <cit>  have shown that different species revealed different patterns of green bands in mild-denaturing electrophoresis. moreover, the content of specific bands is related to the abundance of appropriate proteins, as revealed in arabidopsis mutants 
 <cit> . we characterized  <dig> green bands in pea and bean thylakoids. the first five, with high molecular weight, contained polypeptides corresponding to both lhci-psi and lhcii-psii supercomplexes, while the next three bands with lower molecular weights were attributed to lhcii-psii and lhcii trimers . mild-denaturing conditions retained the structure of cp supercomplexes and megacomplexes proportionally to accessibility of detergent to particular membrane domains 
 <cit> . thus, larger amount of green bands related to lhcii-psii and lhci-psi in bean thylakoids  indicates higher density of membranes and stronger interaction between cp complexes. these observations correlate with previous analysis of the infrared spectrum which demonstrates a higher average protein density in bean than in pea thylakoids 
 <cit> . furthermore, the presence of a high molecular green band and a decrease of grana size were observed in psae1- <dig> mutant of arabidopsis due to accumulation of stable lhci-psi-lhcii supercomplex 
 <cit> . therefore we suggest that higher abundance of the dense megacomplexes influences the thylakoids structure in bean .

on the other hand, the abundance of green bands related to lhcii, loosely and strongly associated with psii, is significantly higher in pea thylakoids . analysis of 77 k spectra indicate a similar proportion between the psi and the psii core complexes in both species, but higher abundance of lhcii in pea thylakoids . higher ratio of lhcii/psii core complexes in pea thylakoids is also confirmed by the apoprotein ratio . furthermore, the difference fluorescence excitation spectra in soret and chlorophyll q regions  indicates a more efficient energy transfer from antennae to the psii reaction centers in pea than in bean thylakoids. these data suggest that more lhcii trimers are weakly attached to the psii supercomplex in pea than in bean. such organization of cp complexes affects the 3d structure of the whole pea chloroplast, where large condensed areas of stacked thylakoid membranes are observed .

a smaller abundance of the lhcii trimers , fluorescence of lhcii antenna  and smaller relative amounts of lhcb <dig> to psba apoproteins in bean  in comparison to pea thylakoids were found. the 77 k difference spectra of bean thylakoids  indicated significant amounts of multiaggregated forms of lhcii which are probably located in separated domains disconnected from psii 
 <cit> . these observations suggest that a smaller number of lhcii trimers per psii reaction center is present in bean than in pea thylakoids.

in spite of the differences in chloroplast structure , protein and cp composition  the photosynthetic efficiency represented by qp is similar in both plants. the parameters qp and qn are not directly related: the former is relevant only to the illuminated state of the sample, whereas the latter describes both the light- and dark-adapted states 
 <cit> . a slight difference in qn  and the moment in which the maximum value of qn is achieved, may suggest distinct reaction to light in the studied plants. these data suggest that bean plants are better adapted to dark–light changes than pea.

non-photochemical quenching can generally be subdivided into three components: feedback de-excitation , photoinhibition  and state transition  
 <cit> . in the context of the present study, qe is of interest, since it is the only component connected with changes induced by high-light exposure on a time scale of a few seconds to minutes 
 <cit> . arabidopsis antisense plants lacking most of the lhcb <dig> and lhcb <dig> proteins exhibited a reduced qe 
 <cit> . however the reduction of qe is less pronounced in these plants than was reported for intermittent light-grown plants from pea, bean and barley 
 <cit> . moreover, in the npq <dig> mutant of chlamydomonas reinhardtii that lacks specifically the lhcbm <dig> gene, qn was drastically reduced 
 <cit> . the simplest interpretation of these data is that the generation of maximum qe requires a scattered organization of the psii antenna including major lhcii. studies of mg2+ induced stacking of isolated thylakoid membranes of spinach proved that grana stacking is of high importance for the process of overall non-photochemical quenching 
 <cit> . maybe because of that the psii complexes in the stacked grana membranes posses a larger functional antenna compared with the psii complexes in the partially and completely unstacked thylakoids 
 <cit> .

the detailed analysis of polyphasic fluorescence curves  and the comparison of those of the respective underlying processes  suggested a larger functional psii antenna size 
 <cit>  in pea than in bean thylakoids. moreover, a different chemical environment, notably a higher number of proton buffering groups, concluded from photoelectrochemical quenching  and photoelectrical stimulation  , suggest higher granum stack in pea chloroplasts 
 <cit> . thus, data obtained by both modulated and transient fluorescence  are in agreement with low temperature spectrophotometry  and quantitative cp analysis .

the size and/or the number of lhcii-psii complexes play a crucial role in the stabilization of 3d grana stacks 
 <cit> . this relation is seen as large areas for pea and small areas for bean of chl fluorescence corresponding to grana stacks . functional analysis confirmed these structural differences . however, computer models prove that this 3d relationship is more complicated  .

it is known that supercomplexes are organized in different megacomplexes 
 <cit>  and the vertical structure of thylakoids is determined by the lhcii-psii and lhcii arrangements 
 <cit> . thus, different distances between the neighbouring membranes in grana stacks, estimated to 21 nm for pea and 16 nm for bean  might be a result of a specific arrangement of large and small lhcii-psii supercomplexes 
 <cit> . on the other hand, it is hard to explain larger dispersion of chl fluorescence  and large irregularity in 3d model for bean chloroplast as compared to pea . probably, a more complicated chloroplast structure might be related to a more complex arrangement of cp complexes .

based on spectroscopic analysis and 3d models we reported recently 
 <cit> , that the differences in the thylakoid arrangement between pea and bean chloroplasts influence the stacking process in vitro. in pea chloroplasts the increase of magnesium ion concentration changed the degree of membrane appression from wrinkled continuous surface to distinguished stacked areas and a significant increase of the inter-grana area, whereas in bean chloroplasts less pronounced tendencies towards formation of the appressed regions were observed 
 <cit> .

the protein-protein and lipid-protein interactions play an important role in the formation of the lhcii-psii megacomplexes in grana thylakoids and influence protein diffusion coefficient 
 <cit> . recently, based on analysis of infrared spectra, we detected lower protein/lipids ratio in pea than in bean thylakoids 
 <cit> . since about 60 % of total-lipids contribute to the boundary lipids 
 <cit> , the amounts of the bulk lipid phase is higher in pea thylakoids but the average protein density is higher in bean 
 <cit> . thus, the differences in the arrangement of supercomplexes between species may be a consequence of both lipid and protein content stoichiometry. however, the diversity of protein isoforms  may play a role in interactions between cp complexes 
 <cit> .

the main goal of our research was to find the relationship between the spatial chloroplast structure detected by clsm in situ and the arrangements of the cp complexes within the thylakoid membranes. our 3d computer models of chloroplasts differ from typical chloroplast depictions 
 <cit> . we showed that stacked areas are noticeably irregular with variable thickness, merging with each other and are not always parallel to each other.

CONCLUSIONS
qualitative and quantitative analysis of chlorophyll-protein complexes as well as spectroscopic investigations suggested a close proportion between psi and psii core complexes in pea and bean thylakoids, but higher abundance of lhcii antenna in pea. moreover, higher accumulation of the aggregated form of lhcii in bean thylakoids and distinct differences in the composition of lhci-psi between the two species were found. such composition of membrane induces formation of large stacked domains in pea and many smaller more heterogeneous regions in bean thylakoids. structural diversity influenced the psii photochemistry and caused larger functional psii antenna size in pea, but did not significantly change its photosynthetic efficiency.

we postulate that the differences in chloroplast structure between species are a consequence of quantitative proportions between the individual supercomplexes, their size and arrangement inside membranes.
