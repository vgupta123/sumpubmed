BACKGROUND
type iv pili are found in many gram-negative bacteria as well as in some gram-positive bacteria and archaea, where they function in numerous cellular processes including adhesion, dna transfer and virulence  <cit> .

furthermore, in the metal reducing bacteria shewanella oneidensis and geobacter sulfurreducens type iv pili have been implicated in extracellular electron transport  pathways  <cit> . both of these organisms can respire on a variety of electron acceptors, including metals such as iron, manganese and uranium oxides, which has made these organisms attractive research targets in the fields of environmental sciences and nanotechnology  <cit> . s. oneidensis and g. sulfurreducens can reduce extracellular electron acceptors directly through membrane bound cytochromes  <cit> ; s. oneidensis can also produce soluble electron shuttles to transfer electrons to extracellular acceptors  <cit> . to allow for highly efficient electron transfer rates, s. oneidensis and g. sulfurreducens can form biofilms in which strong cell-cell interactions and contact between cells and insoluble electron acceptors are beneficial in certain habitats  <cit> . such an attachment function is expected to implicate type iv pili.

type iv pili have been associated with a more direct role in eet. both s. oneidensis and g. sulfurreducens can form conductive filaments that transfer electrons extracellularly over multiple cell lengths from one cell to another and from a cell to an electron acceptor  <cit> . these filaments were collectively termed nanowires. while it was clearly shown that nanowires in g. sulfurreducens were made of the type iv pilin pila, the exact subunits of nanowires in shewanella have not been identified so far. yet, there has been strong evidence that nanowires are made of proteins and studies have indicated the contribution of pili in extracellular electron transport  <cit>  – whether this is due to an indirect role by attaching to electron acceptors or due to a direct role by nanowire formation, is not clear at this point. altogether, the high overall similarity between g. sulfurreducens and s. oneidensis, including metabolic pathways, the prevalence of multiheme cytochromes and the formation of conductive filaments, makes it very likely that nanowires in both species are formed in a similar way and function based on the same principles.

currently, two major hypotheses prevail on how nanowires transfer electrons. the metallic-like conductivity theory claims that type iv pili are the conductive units themselves  <cit> . the aromatic amino acids in pila are supposedly aligned so closely that the π-electrons can be delocalized and be transferred along the pilus like in a metal lattice. according to the alternative multi-step hopping theory, type iv pili only form the backbone of nanowires to which multiheme cytochromes such as mtrc and omca in s. oneidensis and omcs and omcz in g. sulfurreducens, respectively, attach  <cit> . the electrons can then hop from one heme of one protein to another heme of the neighboring protein. so far, the electron transfer mechanism along bacterial nanowires is not clear yet and the discussion, on which of the two mechanisms is true, is ongoing  <cit> .

type iv pilins  build up the polymeric pilus in a repetitive way  <cit> . two kinds of type iv pilins have been described, type iva and ivb pilins . these two types are primarily distinguished by the length of their leader sequences with t4aps containing an n-terminal leader sequence of  <dig> to  <dig> residues, whereas the leader sequences in t4bps range from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . generally, t4aps are synthesized as pre-pilins in the cytoplasm and are guided to the inner membrane by their n-terminal leader sequence  <cit> , which is then cleaved off at a conserved cleavage site by the leader peptidase pild at the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane  <cit> . the new n-terminus  is then methylated and the processed pilins are inserted into the pilus by an inner membrane multimeric complex   <cit>  and the assembled pilus is fully exported into the extracellular space via the outer membrane secretin pilq  <cit> . the n-terminal transmembrane domain of type iv pilins is an approximately  <dig> residues long hydrophobic α-helix, which has a highly conserved sequence among different species. downstream of this sequence motif, the sequence variability of t4aps is however very high and the total length of pilin proteins can vary from  <dig> residues   <cit>  to more than  <dig> residues   <cit> .

t4aps share the signature of the n-terminal leader sequence and the transmembrane α-helix with pseudopilins  <cit>  like a type iv pilus, a pseudopilus extends from the inner membrane into the periplasm, but it does not go beyond the outer membrane  <cit>  . instead, it is associated with the type ii secretion system and is involved in the secretion of virulence factors from the periplasm to the extracellular environment  <cit> .

so far, more than  <dig> structures of different t4ps and more than  <dig> structures of pseudopilins have been deposited in the protein data bank . however, only four structures of a full‐length t4p are available. all other t4p structures – and all pseudopilin structures – are of n‐terminally truncated constructs that do not include the n‐terminal hydrophobic transmembrane α‐helix. this is unfortunate, as this part is the most conserved part among t4ps and pseudopilins. still, all structures of t4aps and pseudopilins exhibit a conserved central core of a long n-terminal α-helix packed against three to four antiparallel β-strands  <cit> . however, various structural elements can be inserted around this conserved core allowing for the diverse functions of t4ps. in  <dig> the structure of the nanowire associated pilin pila from g. sulfurreducens was determined by nmr spectroscopy revealing a single,  <dig> residue long α-helix  <cit> , but as yet, no structure of a t4p from s. oneidensis is available.

in this work, we have determined the structure of the putative nanowire associated t4p on the gene locus so_ <dig>  from s. oneidensis by x-ray crystallography to a resolution of  <dig>  Å. this t4p from s. oneidensis shares the highest degree of sequence identity to pila from g. sulfurreducens  when comparing the first  <dig> residues after the cleavage site . . the structure reveals the conserved fold of a type iv pilin with a parallel dimer in the asymmetric unit. we have also used small angle x-ray scattering  and synchrotron radiation circular dichroism  to characterize the structure and stability of this protein in solution.

RESULTS
sequence conservation and position in the genome
the pilin protein encoded by the gene locus so_ <dig> exhibits the conserved n-terminal leader sequence  and a hydrophobic patch of  <dig> residues expected to form a transmembrane helix, which is the hallmark of both type iv pilins and pseudopilins  <cit>  . additionally, it possesses two conserved cysteines in the c-terminal part  which form a disulfide bridge in t4ps. based on these features, we classified the protein so_ <dig> as a type iv pilin and added it to the subclass of t4aps due to its short leader sequence.figure  <dig>

so far, no consistent nomenclature for t4ps has been established and therefore, newly described t4ps cannot be named unambiguously. the low sequence similarity among t4ps further complicates the naming process. for this reason, the naming of the t4p on the gene locus so_ <dig> will briefly be outlined here. so_ <dig> is the first open reading frame in a gene cluster consisting of three other putative type iv pilins  and a type iv pilin adhesin with a bactofilin motif . bactofilins are fiber forming, membrane attached proteins that have been identified in many gram-negative bacteria and they are associated with cytoskeleton related functions such as cell motility, cell morphology and cell division  <cit> . in m. xanthus the polymerized bactofilin bacp directly interacts with pilb and pilt which are responsible for extension and retraction of type iv pili, respectively, and thus for the motility of the cell  <cit> . in s. oneidensis a bactofilin   <cit>  was shown to localize to the cell division ring and this bactofilin was therefore assumed to be associated with cell division  <cit> . even though bactofilins constitute a recently discovered protein family and their functions have not been fully elucidated yet, the finding of this motif in the putative adhesin in this operon is intriguing. for this reason, we named the five pilin proteins on the gene loci so_ <dig>  so_ <dig>  so_ <dig>  so_ <dig> and so_ <dig> pilbac <dig>  pilbac <dig>  pilbac <dig>  pilbac <dig> and pilbac <dig> respectively.

construction and purification of a soluble construct
to obtain a soluble version of pilbac <dig>  a construct was designed that lacks the n-terminal  <dig> residues including the signal peptide and the transmembrane α-helix. instead, a his-tag and a tev protease cleavage site were inserted to enable tag removal  during the purification process . this construct was termed pilbac1Δn. the protein was well-expressed in e. coli and could be purified to homogeneity in a two-step purification procedure using two passes over a ni-column  followed by size exclusion chromatography. size exclusion chromatography of pilbac1Δn gave a monodisperse peak and, comparing the elution volume with those of globular standard proteins that were used for calibration of the size exclusion column, a molecular weight of 11 kda was estimated, which is close to the theoretical monomeric weight of  <dig>  kda.

thermostability of pilbac1Δn
the stability of pilbac1Δn was assessed by srcd measurements where the temperature was increased stepwise from  <dig> to 81°c and data were recorded from 280 nm to 190 nm . with increasing temperature the signal strength at  <dig>   <dig> and 222 nm fell, indicating a change or a loss of structure. interestingly, this effect was partly reversed when re-cooling the sample back to 24°c indicating that the protein could, at least partially, refold. the change of the structure was analyzed with principle component analysis   and the contribution of the different components relative to the temperature is shown in figure 2c. the inflection points of both curves yield an approximate melting temperature of  <dig> and 38°c respectively. a somewhat higher value  was obtained in a thermofluor assay . in the thermofluor experiment, a steeper gradient was applied and this might have resulted in a higher melting temperature compared to the srcd measurements. in general, a melting temperature around or below 40°c has been claimed to counteract crystallization  <cit> .figure  <dig>

x-ray crystallography
an initial hit was obtained in the structure screen from molecular dimensions in condition  <dig> 2so <dig>  30% peg  <dig> ) at 15 mg/ml at 19°c. these crystals could not be reproduced when manually recreating the conditions. introducing 100 mm ches ph  <dig>  as a buffer component into the crystallization condition yielded crystals of around 50x50x <dig> μm <dig>  additionally, the ratio between protein and reservoir solution was increased from 1: <dig> to 2: <dig>  the best looking crystals were consistently obtained at 26% peg  <dig> ,  <dig>  m 2so <dig> and  <dig>  m ches ph  <dig> . the crystal structure of pilbac1Δn was initially determined by sulfur sad at 2 Å resolution based on the anomalous signal of the two cysteines in the c-terminal domain, a bound sulfate molecule and a bound sodium ion . a high resolution data set was collected on another crystal and data were processed in the high symmetry space group i <dig> to a resolution of  <dig>  Å using the cc1/ <dig> value as a cut-off  <cit>  . the model obtained from s-sad was then used as a search model in molecular replacement for this data set, and all residues were modelled into clear electron density with no apparent ambiguities. the crystal form had a large solvent content  yielding a high optical resolution and favorable data-to-parameter ratio at  <dig>  Å resolution. riding hydrogen atoms were included in the last model refinement and this resulted in a decrease in rfree of 1%.table  <dig>

additional density was observed at the interface to the large solvent channels of the crystal. this density could not be attributed to solvent or an additional copy of the protein, but probably integrates features of partially associated molecules from the mother liquor or buffer solutions used for purification, such as peg, glycerol, ions and water .

overall structure
pilbac1Δn consists of one long n-terminal α-helix packed against  <dig> antiparallel β-strands resembling the core fold of type iv pilins . a long loop forms the αβ-loop connecting the α-helix and the first β-strand. this region is among the most variable parts in t4p structures and can contain insertions of a short α-helix or a short β-strand or simply display a random coil loop structure as it is the case for pilbac1Δn. the two cysteines in the loops b2-b <dig> and the loop after b <dig> indeed form the conserved disulfide bridge of t4ps that forms the disulfide-bounded loop region  and keeps strands  <dig> and  <dig> together.figure  <dig>

Δn. a: pilbac <dig> contains a long n-terminal α-helix , an unstructured αβ-loop ,  <dig> antiparallel β-strands  and a conserved d-region framed by the two cysteines forming a disulfide bridge . the oxidized cysteines are shown as sticks. b, c: electrostatic potential of pilbac1∆n. red: negatively charged; blue: positively charged.



pilbac1Δn exhibits two positively charged surface patches at the n- and at the c-terminus of the α-helix due to closely spaced arginines and lysines facing the solvent area . a negatively charged patch is formed by residues in the c-terminus and the top of the head domain. these charged regions might act as a platform for interactions with other molecules, for example with other pilins in the pilus or receptors for attachment. for instance, in the structure of pile from neisseria gonorrhoeae docked into an em envelope of a pilus, positively charged patches were suggested to be responsible for dna binding  <cit> . for a pilin protein from s. oneidensis such as pilbac <dig>  potential binding partners could be multiheme cytochromes which were suggested to be the electron transporting components in nanowires  <cit> . in g. sulfurreducens, the multiheme cytochrome omcs was shown to co-localize with nanowires suggesting a direct interaction  <cit>  and a similar interaction can be expected from multiheme cytochromes in s. oneidensis.

comparison to other type iv pilins and pseudopilins
pilbac1Δn is structurally similar to other t4ps in the α-helix and the first two β-strands. however, variable regions are also characteristic of type iv pilins. these include the αβ-loop and the loops connecting the β-strands and parts of the d-region. the loops between the β-strands have been proposed to be involved in contact formation with interaction partners  <cit> . in pilbac1Δn, loops b1-b <dig> and b2-b <dig> are relatively long. compared to other type iv pilins, pilbac1Δn is very compact without any additional motifs or insertions, mostly due to its short sequence relative to other t4p head domains. in the reported structures of t4aps, a disulfide bridge is usually formed between cysteines in the fourth β-strand  and the last loop . in contrast, in pilbac <dig> the first cysteine is not situated in b <dig>  but in the loop from b <dig> to b <dig>  another exception is the structure of pila_ <dig> in which the disulfide bridge is formed by two cysteines in β-strands b <dig> and b <dig>  <cit> .

in general, structures of full-length t4ps exhibit two kinks in the long n-terminal α-helix, one in the transmembrane part  and one in the c-terminal part of the α-helix  . these two kinks are due to helix breaking residues  at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  which are conserved among most t4aps. interestingly, pilbac <dig> possesses a helix breaking proline at position  <dig>  but a helix breaking residue is missing at position  <dig> . therefore, kink  <dig> is missing in pilbac <dig> and the α-helix in the structure of pilbac1Δn is straight. such a feature has commonly been observed in structures of pseudopilins and in the t4bps pils from s. typhi and tcpa from v. cholerae as well as in two t4a pilins, namely pila from g. sulfurreducens and pila_ <dig> from t. thermophilus. the feature of a straight α-helix could suggest a different mode of packing in the pilus .

to identify homologous structures to pilbac1Δn, a search with the dali server  <cit>  was performed . as expected, structures of type iv pilins scored the highest and among them, the highest score was seen with the t4aps pila_ <dig> from t. thermophilus  <cit>  , followed by the minor pilin pilx from n. meningitis  <cit>   and the pak pilin from p. aeruginosa  <cit>   . pila_ <dig> is one of the exceptions of t4aps with a straight, continuous α-helix and superimposes well with pilbac1Δn . the biggest variation between pila_ <dig> and pilbac1Δn lies in the αβ-loop, which forms a short α-helix in pila_ <dig> and a random coil structure in pilbac1Δn.figure  <dig>

pilbac1Δn also shares structural similarity with pseudopilins, which superimpose well in the core regions . as for other type iv pilins, the biggest differences are observed in the variable regions. additionally, pseudopilins coordinate a calcium ion in the d-region, where pilbac1Δn and other type iv pilins form a conserved disulfide bridge  <cit> .

pilbac1Δn overlays well with the α-helix of pila from g. sulfurreducens and the feature of a straight α-helix after the transmembrane part ; yet, this t4ap structure was not scored high by the dali server, as pila from g. sulfurreducens does not contain a head domain. noteworthy, a gene  is located directly downstream of pila that codes for a protein that was shown to be up‐regulated together with pila and a few multiheme cytochromes in microbial fuel cells  <cit> . furthermore, pila was not detected by western blotting in strains deficient for gsu <dig>  <cit> . therefore, this protein might constitute the missing head domain of pila from g. sulfurreducens and a future structural comparison of this protein with pilbac1Δn would be very interesting.

dimeric interface
pilbac1Δn was crystallized as a parallel dimer in the asymmetric unit in which the interface is formed by interactions between  <dig> and  <dig> residues in the α-helix from monomers a and b, respectively  . previously it was noted that pilins can exist as dimers and multimers  <cit> . many structures of type iv pilins and pseudopilins were also determined in a dimeric  <cit>  or even in a trimeric state  <cit> . however, different to pilbac1Δn, most of them were not arranged in a physiologically relevant conformation . the structures of the t4p cofa from e. coli  and of the pseudopilin pulg from e. coli  were determined as dimers, in which the monomers are further apart from each other. this dimerization was probably caused by crystal contacts. in contrast, in the structure of full-length fima from d. nodosus, the two monomers are held together by extensive, intermolecular interactions. however, unlike pilbac1Δn, the dimeric interface is here formed between the transmembrane domains.figure  <dig>

since the n-terminal transmembrane domain in pilbac1Δn is missing in the structure, we modelled this conserved part based on the full-length structure of mature pile from n. gonorrhoeae, as this region is highly conserved in t4ps as a transmembrane α-helix . this additional domain extends the α-helices in both monomers in the crystal dimer by a further  <dig> residues without the introduction of any clashes . consequently, this arrangement maintains contacts between both monomers and allows for the existence of the dimer in a membrane . in the modelled part of the alpha helix, a kink is introduced due to the presence of a conserved helix breaking proline in the transmembrane helix at position  <dig> . such a kink has been described in all four available full-length structures of t4ps  <cit>  and separates the n- and the c-terminal parts of the helix from each other.

to assess the oligomeric state of pilbac1Δn in solution we performed saxs studies at concentrations ranging from  <dig> –  <dig> mg/ml . no signs of aggregation or repulsive forces were observed from the scattering data at any of these concentrations as judged by comparison of the scattering intensities at low scattering angles for all concentrations used. guinier and porod analysis revealed a radius of gyration of  <dig> and  <dig> Å respectively, and the molecular mass determined by porod volume analysis indicated a molecular weight of only  <dig> kda, which is below the theoretical molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. kratky analysis indicated a well-folded molecule . altogether, these findings indicated that pilbac1Δn existed as a monomer in solution. a dummy atom  model of pilbac1Δn was built by the program dammif based on the saxs data  <cit>  and the crystal structure of monomeric pilbac1Δn compared to the da model using the program supcomb  <cit> , yielding a good fit. in ucsf chimera  <cit>  a simulated map at  <dig> Å based on the crystal structure was fitted to a saxs envelope based on the da model giving a cc of  <dig>  . a scattering curve was calculated on the basis of the crystal structure using the program crysol  <cit>  and compared to the experimentally measured scattering data. this resulted in a chi value  of  <dig> , which is indicative of good agreement.figure  <dig>

Δn docked into its saxs envelope. a dummy atom model from the saxs data was generated with dammif  <cit>  and superposed onto the crystal structure with supcomb  <cit> . this oriented saxs model was then converted into an envelope with the pdb2vol software from the situs package  <cit> .



the results from the saxs analysis were further substantiated by size exclusion chromatography and a pisa analysis  <cit> , which indicated that the pilbac1Δn dimer interface energy was low. however, the environment in a membrane with potentially interacting transmembrane helices is very different from that of a truncated protein in solution, the local concentration of pilins is significantly higher and the degree of translational freedom is reduced in a membrane. therefore we cannot exclude a possible function of dimeric pilbac <dig> in the membrane, but further studies on the full-length pilbac <dig> in membranes and assembled into pili will be needed to evaluate oligomeric states of pilbac <dig> 

na+-ion binding site
in chain b clear density was observed, both in the anomalous map from the s-sad data with a peak height of  <dig>  σ  and in the 2mfo-dfc map from the high resolution data set, for an ion bound between the aβ-loop and the first β-strand. this ion was octahedrally coordinated by oxygen atoms  with average coordination distances of  <dig>  Å . in agreement with these coordination properties, its anomalous scattering intensity and consistent with the presence of 100 mm nacl in the buffer, we assigned this ion to a sodium ion .figure  <dig>

interestingly, this sodium ion was not observed in chain a due to a slight distortion of the ion binding site compared to chain b. the backbone of leu <dig> is further away from the binding site increasing the distance from  <dig>  to  <dig>  Å . additionally, a third water molecule is missing to coordinate the ion; instead, another water molecule binds in the position where the sodium binds in chain b. furthermore, features of positive density lie between the sodium ion binding site in chain a and a symmetry related molecule. this density is indicative of a bound molecule such as peg which might have interfered with binding of the ion in this site.

so far, no functionally validated binding of any ions has been described for t4ps. for pseudopilins the stabilization by calcium ions has been shown  <cit> . whether the bound sodium ion in pilbac1Δn fulfills a functional role or is a crystal artefact due to the 100 mm nacl in the buffer, is not clear yet. hypothetically, the na+ ion could act as a regulator in filament assembly. in the extracellular space and periplasm, the sodium concentration is much higher than intracellularly and we find it possible that the pilin might bind a sodium ion in the periplasm.

modelling of a pilbac <dig> pilus
to investigate the putative packing in a pilus, a model composed of pilbac <dig> subunits was generated . in order to do this, an atomic pilus model based on the em structure of a pile pilus and the crystal structures of pile from n. gonorrhoeae were used as a template  <cit> . first, the structure of a pilbac1Δn monomer was superimposed onto monomeric pile and the missing n-terminal  <dig> residues were modelled resulting in a full-length model of pilbac <dig>  this full-length chimera was then overlaid onto the individual subunits in the pile pilus based on the modelled, very similar transmembrane part. no significant clashes between the subunits were introduced, only minor clashes between the n-terminal part of the helix of one monomer and the c-terminal part of the helix of the neighboring monomer .figure  <dig>

as for the neisseria pilus, the α-helices formed the central core with the head domains facing outwards; however, in contrast to the neisseria pilus, the packing seemed to be less dense due to the missing kink in the c-terminal part of the helix  and due to a smaller head domain. the positively charged patch at the n-terminus from one pilin is located closely to the negatively charged patch of the neighbouring pilin stabilizing the interaction between pilins in the pilus filament. . overall, the pilbac <dig> pilus was a bit thinner than for neisseria, because the head domain in pilbac <dig> is less bulky with no major grooves or protrusions on the surface.

this model for a pilbac <dig> pilus is in good agreement with the general observations that the d-region is involved in the interaction with other molecules  <cit>  and should be solvent accessible. still, it needs to be considered that this model is based on a model pilus from n. gonorrhoeae which in turn is based on the docking of the crystal structure of pile into an em envelope. unlike pile, pilbac <dig> does not contain a kink in the α-helix after the transmembrane part which will orient the head domain in a slightly different angle . this will necessarily affect the packing pattern in a pilus and inevitably lead to differences to the pile pilus and therefore, this model has to be interpreted with some caution.

aromatic amino acids in pilbac1
malvankar and co-workers have proposed that nanowires from g. sulfurreducens are conductive due to the close positioning of aromatic amino acids in pila  <cit> . the nmr structure of pila from g. sulfurreducens showed that the aromatic side chains were indeed closely spaced with a maximum distance of 15 Å  <cit> ; yet, to the best of our knowledge, the maximum distance between aromatic groups that allows for electron transfer has not been defined so far. similar to g. sulfurreducens, s. oneidensis forms conductive nanowires and, based on the overall similarity between these two organisms including metabolic pathways and the prevalence of multiheme cytochromes, a similar electron transfer mechanism is very likely. pilbac <dig> is the type iv pilin which is most closely related to pila from g. sulfurreducens based on sequence comparisons . the full-length chimeric model of pilbac <dig> contained  <dig> aromatic residues including two phenylalanines and one tyrosine in the modelled transmembrane domain. in the modelled pilus of pilbac <dig> subunits, the aromatic side chains were evenly spaced throughout the whole structure, with some being closer to their neighbors than others . a long chain of aromatic side chains wound along the modelled filament with two clusters on each subunit in which the aromatics are closely positioned to each other with distances between  <dig> to 7 Å. yet, these two clusters are separated by a gap of 11 Å which can be defined as the maximum distance between two aromatics in the pilus model. this distance compares well to pila from geobacter; however, the arrangement of aromatic side chains in pile from n. gonorrhoeae – which has not been shown to produce conductive nanowires yet – is similar with a maximum distance between individual aromatic side chains of around 13 Å . this may argue against the hypothesis stating that conductivity is based on a specific alignment of aromatic side chains.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we described the high-resolution structure of the n-terminally truncated type iv pilin pilbac <dig> which exhibits the typical fold of type iv pilins with a long n-terminal α-helix packed against  <dig> antiparallel β-strands. pilbac <dig> was crystallized as a parallel dimer with a sodium ion bound to one of the monomers. small-angle x-ray scattering studies of the n-terminally truncated pilbac <dig> indicated that the protein exists as a monomer in solution, but further characterization of the full-length form and/or membrane bound form will be necessary to clarify the oligomeric state of pilbac <dig> in a cellular context. in contrast to most other t4ap head domains, pilbac <dig> displays a straight α-helix and a small head domain which leads to a less dense packing mode in a modelled pilus compared to other well-characterized pilins and possibly making room for interaction partners such as multiheme cytochromes.
