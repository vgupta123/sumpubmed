BACKGROUND
mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of the epithelial barrier critical for normal function in the gastrointestinal tract have been incompletely understood  <cit> , with increasing interest in the barrier function of mucosal surfaces. in the oral cavity the epithelia attachment to the tooth presents a particular challenge as this is the only tissue environment where the eruption of teeth effectively results in a permanent breach in the integrity of the integument. in the process of tooth eruption the remnant of the epithelium responsible for secretion of the organic matrix of enamel melds with a down-growth of the oral epithelium to generate the epithelial attachment to the tooth  <cit> . cd <dig> is selectively strongly expressed by the epithelial attachment to the tooth and by the epithelium lining of the lesion of chronic periodontitis. this antigen is recognized by auto-reactive serum antibodies in patients with chronic periodontal disease  <cit>  and increased titres of antibodies reactive with cd <dig> peptide correlated with more favourable diagnosis, suggesting a protective effect  <cit> . cd <dig> is a heavily glycosylated peptide ligand for vascular p-selectin and is anchored by phosphoinositol linkage to lipid rafts within the cell membrane  <cit> . it has been shown to be a regulator of the chemokine cxcr <dig>  <cit>  and cd <dig> mediates expression of cell adhesion molecules in b lymphocytes with evidence for a signaling function for the cd <dig> receptor provided by the regulation of apoptosis in b cell precursors by monoclonal antibodies reactive with cd <dig>  <cit> . isoforms of cd <dig> expressed as 33– <dig> kda and  <dig> kda entities typically contain n-glycosylation patterns including α <dig> -sialic acid groups as primary sites for recognition by the l <dig> transmembrane receptor  <cit>  that is also expressed by the epithelial attachment to the tooth and that lining the lesion of periodontitis . intra- and inter-cellular signaling occurring through interaction between cd <dig> and l <dig> could be modulated by lectin-like molecules such as the sialic acid binding protein hsa from streptococcus gordonii, an early coloniser in bacterial plaque  <cit> , or by antibodies that recognize cd <dig>  <cit> . these ligands for cd <dig> have potential to either activate signaling through cd <dig> or perturb signals mediated by constitutive interaction between cd <dig> and l <dig> 

the reactive epithelium associated with inflammatory periodontal disease has a number of features that distinguish it from stratified squamous epithelia in other sites in the body. these include cytokeratin  <cit>  and involucrin  <cit>  expression profiles that do not support a typical pattern of terminal differentiation, reduced expression of e-cadherin and perturbation of f-actin filament structure  <cit> . this epithelium supports the transmigration of neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocytes as a critical element of defence against the adjacent microbial biofilm  <cit> . immuno-pathological responses to bacterial antigens are considered to be central in the pathogenesis of the destructive disease of periodontitis where the normal structure of the epithelium is perturbed  <cit>  with evidence that cytokines released by adjacent inflammatory infiltrate cells act to disrupt epithelial tight junctions  <cit>  responsible for barrier function to exclude low molecular weight microbial products.

the current consensus model for lining epithelium indicates initial cell-cell adhesion mediated by the cadherin complex as a key pre-requisite for the establishment of other types of cell junctions and of epithelial polarity; a property initially assigned to highly aligned epithelia such as the intestinal lining but more recently recognised to occur to a degree in most lining epithelia including the epidermis  <cit>  and non-keratinised oral epithelial tissues  <cit> . the presence of tight junctions in normal stratified epithelia, metaplastic stratified epithelia and cultured derivatives of these tissues, has been a subject of controversy  <cit> . functional studies have indicated the importance of claudin- <dig> expression in the permeability barrier of the epidermis of newborn mice  <cit>  and langbein et al.  <cit>  have described a range of morphological types of close intercellular contacts associated with localisation of tight junction proteins in diverse mucosal sites.

e-cadherin association with the actin cytoskeleton is mediated by catenins and this complex also localizes the partitioning defective par-3/par-6/atypical pkc polarity complex  <cit> . activation of this complex mediated by binding to the small gtpase cdc <dig> results in phosphorylation and activation of atypical pkc. this pathway is considered to be important in promoting the appropriate formation of tight junction complexes possibly initiated by the binding of zonula occludens- <dig>  and zonula occludens- <dig>  to catenin. zo- <dig> and zo- <dig> function as sub-membrane anchors for the tight junction components occludin and the claudins  <cit> . components of the intercellular junction structure include occludin  <cit>  and the claudins comprising an extensive family of twenty four proteins  <cit> . the claudin composition of the tight junction defines the particular properties of the junction  <cit>  with claudins- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> reported to be prominent in stratified epithelia  <cit> .

in the culture model used in previous study  <cit> , h <dig> oral epithelial cells responded to specific suppression of cd <dig> mrna and the associated reduction of surface cd <dig> protein by down-regulating e-cadherin expression. ligation of cd <dig> on h <dig> cells by monoclonal antibodies to cd <dig> peptide resulted in strong stimulation of e-cadherin mrna expression  <cit> . the objective of the present study was to investigate the potential for cd <dig> to regulate barrier function of oral epithelial monolayers in order to define mechanisms underlying the physiological function of the highly specialized epithelium of the periodontal attachment as the initial component responsible for the microbial barrier function of the oro-gastro-intestinal tract.

RESULTS
anti-cd <dig> peptide antibody reduces passage of dextran across the epithelial monolayers
monolayers were cultured to confluence on membranes within diffusion chambers as described in methods. the accumulation of labeled dextran in the lower chamber measured at time points showed h <dig> monolayers were impermeable to high molecular weight dextran tetramethylrhodamine , indicating the integrity of the monolayer but were permeable to low molecular weight dextran alexa fluor  <dig> . relative to isotype control antibody, addition of anti-cd <dig> peptide antibody resulted in a significant reduction in the accumulation of low molecular weight dextran in the lower chamber .

altered gene expression of tight junctions mediated by anti-cd <dig> peptide antibody
reduced transfer of low molecular weight marker to the lower chamber suggested tight junction function. the responses to anti-cd <dig> peptide antibody, of genes encoding tight junction proteins commonly expressed in stratified epithelia  <cit> , were screened and analysed by rt-pcr arrays . significant up-regulation of genes encoding zo- <dig>  zo- <dig>  occludin and par- <dig>  was validated by quantitative real-time rt-pcr . expression of par- <dig> and claudin- <dig>  not detected in control cultures by  <dig> cycles of pcr, was demonstrable following challenge with anti-cd <dig> peptide antibody . gene expression for claudin- <dig> and par- <dig> was not detected in control samples by real-time quantitative rt-pcr analysis .

changes in barrier formation of epithelial monolayers related to both increased levels and peripheral deployment of zo- <dig>  zo- <dig>  occludin and claudin-7
cell lysates were probed with antibodies to tight junction proteins in western blot analysis to confirm that the increase in gene expression was manifest as up-regulation of tight junction proteins. the data presented in figure 3a and 3b indicate a significant increase in levels of zo- <dig>  zo- <dig> and occludin in cultures challenged with anti-cd <dig> antibody. par- <dig> and claudin- <dig> were not detected in either control or anti-cd <dig> treated cultures. probing for claudin- <dig> indicated multiple bands in extracts of anti-cd <dig> treated cultures  whereas a single reactive product was detected for cultures challenged with isotype control antibody. multimers of claudins have been reported  <cit>  and also complexes of claudin- <dig> with epcam, a pan-epithelial, homophilic intercellular adhesion molecule  <cit> . epcam was reported to form tight associations with claudin- <dig> that resist dissociation in sds page and result in a range of molecular weight entities detected by anti-claudin- <dig> antibodies  <cit> . it is possible that stimulation through cd <dig> induced complex formation of claudin- <dig> with epcam resulting in stabilization of the protein. this would explain the greater abundance of claudin- <dig> following stimulation with anti-cd <dig> antibody despite the lack of evidence for increase in mrna expression for this product .

confocal microscopy confirmed that while there was evidence from western blot of moderate increase in tight junction protein expression in cultures challenged with anti-cd <dig> peptide antibody , there were marked changes in distribution from focal plaques or diffuse cytoplasmic staining in control cultures to continuous deposition at cell borders following challenge with anti-cd <dig> peptide antibody . occludin, a component of the intercellular junction structure  <cit> , was redistributed from a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern to a well-defined cell border pattern noted to be continuous by three hours after anti-cd <dig> antibody treatment. in contrast, zo- <dig> was rearranged from a focal peripheral pattern to a continuous cell border pattern in keeping with its role as a sub-membrane anchor for tight junction components  <cit> . although a similar role has been described for zo- <dig>  changes for this protein were less marked and the distribution pattern in cells challenged with anti-cd <dig> antibody was not uniform. the changes are compatible with protein kinase activity reported  <cit>  to be implicatedin driving appropriate location of tight junction proteins. claudin- <dig> showed both cytoplasmic and cell membrane localisation in cultures treated with either anti-cd <dig> antibody or isotype control antibody but with increased intensity of staining  in anti-cd <dig> challenged cultures.

examination of the claudin- <dig> frame counter-stained with dapi indicates that the claudin- <dig> network is located at a deeper plane as revealed by confocal optical sectioning. this finding could be explained by the report of localisation of claudin- <dig> to basolateral membrane complexes in association with tetraspanins  <cit>  that are removed from the area of tight junctions  <cit> . while the present findings do not confirm a direct contribution of claudin- <dig> to the observed barrier function, membrane localised claudin- <dig> is reported to regulate e-cadherin expression  <cit> , disclosing an indirect mechanism of support for effective junctions. confocal imaging for par- <dig> and claudin- <dig> did not reveal the localisation of these molecules. these findings establish that stimulation by anti-cd <dig> induces selective up-regulation of components of tight junctions but more apparently, re-distribution of zo- <dig>  zo- <dig> and occludin to the cell periphery where it is possible that the formation of functional tight junction complexes is responsible for the enhanced barrier function observed. the contribution of claudins, regarded as essential tight junction components, was not confirmed in this analysis.

distribution of f-actin supports the peripheral deployment of tight junction proteins
cultures treated with isotype control antibody demonstrated scattered cells with typical f-actin filaments extending through the long axis of the cell but with most cells displaying concentration of f-actin in regions of the cell periphery . in contrast, cultures treated with anti-cd <dig> antibody demonstrated more uniform distribution with greater intensity of f-actin localised to the periphery of the cells . the findings indicate a rapid and specific re-organisation of f-actin filaments in anti-cd <dig> antibody-treated cultures to support intercellular junctions.

ultrastructural analysis
cross-sections of semi-thin sections stained with toluidine blue indicated changes in morphology following challenge with anti-cd <dig> antibody. cultures determined to be confluent by phase contrast microscopy, showed, at  <dig> h after incubation with isotype control antibody, mostly flattened cells with intercellular contacts localised to the region adjacent to the polyester membrane. cultures challenged with anti-cd <dig> antibody contained a majority of cells with raised profile and more extensive intercellular contacts.

low magnification was used to evaluate the nature of intercellular contacts for those cultures challenged with anti-cd <dig> antibody versus isotype control antibody. it was observed for preparations sectioned en face that abundant cell processes were more uniformly distributed in cultures treated with anti-cd <dig> antibody . close contacts in the basal regions abutting the supporting polyester membrane  were evident in cross-sections of cutures challenged with isotype control antibody. in contrast, cultures treated with anti-cd <dig> antibody exhibited more extensive close contacts between processes of adjacent cells . these contacts were characterised by intense staining of adjacent membranes, frequently in proximity to desmosomes. in cultures treated with anti-cd <dig> antibody, close membrane contacts included extended junctions  characteristic of occludin-containing junctions in stratified epithelia and cultured derivatives of these tissues  <cit> . similar structural entities were not detected in cultures treated with isotype control antibody despite frequent observation of regions of close intercellular contact . description of the distribution of proteins in the intercellular bridges of tight junctions of stratified mucosal epithelia has emerged only recently based on immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analysis  <cit> .

cd <dig> regulates transcription of genes encoding tight junction proteins in un-stimulated epithelial cultures
to determine if cd <dig> was important in maintaining basal levels of expression of genes encoding tight junction proteins an rna interference strategy was employed as described in the methods. analysis of extracted mrna indicated selective suppression of zo- <dig>  zo- <dig>  occludin, claudin- <dig> and par- <dig> expression  that was confirmed by quantitative real-time rt-pcr , with the degree of suppression correlating with the effectiveness of sirna inserts in down-regulating cd <dig> mrna . this data indicated that cd <dig> functions normally to maintain levels of expression of selected genes encoding tight junction components. a potential mechanism is by signaling mediated by intra- and inter-cellular interaction of cd <dig> with l <dig> that is also expressed by these epithelial cells . a high degree of inverse correlation was evident between those genes up-regulated by anti-cd <dig> treatment  and down-regulated following silencing of cd <dig> expression . effective silencing of cd <dig> expression was associated with enhanced expression of snail, twist and tgf-β <dig> in this model  <cit> . over-expression of snail in an epithelial model also potently down-regulated expression of occludin, claudin- <dig>  claudin- <dig> and claudin- <dig> accompanied by disruption of tight junctions and adherens junctions  <cit> , providing a plausible link to explain the findings from the present study. effective down-regulation of cd <dig> was associated with a short-term increase in permeability of the epithelial monolayer to low molecular weight dextran . this data suggested that cd <dig> maintains a minimal barrier function in un-stimulated cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, cd <dig> levels observed in un-treated h <dig> clone- <dig> cells  <cit>  are required to maintain moderate levels of expression of selected genes encoding tight junction components. this function did not support uniform peripheral deployment of the corresponding tight junction proteins but it was associated with a limited barrier function of the monolayer in restricting the passage of low molecular weight dextran. silencing of cd <dig> expression was previously linked to down-regulation of e-cadherin  <cit> . findings from the present study indicated the additional effect of down-regulating the expression of selected tight junction components could be responsible for the permeability changes observed. in this study, a monoclonal antibody to cd <dig> peptide was used to mimic the potential action of auto-reactive antibodies to cd <dig>  the effect was to increase the synthesis of zo- <dig>  zo- <dig> and occludin, but a more pronounced consequence was the re-deployment of these proteins to the cell periphery. for occludin, zo- <dig> and zo- <dig>  the arrangement was compatible with tight junction formation whereas claudin- <dig> was distributed in a different manner. these changes were associated with substantial improvement of barrier function that was compatible with effective tight junctions. while the data indicate that cd <dig> has an important role in regulating expression of tight junction components, activation by an external ligand was necessary to induce a second function, the deployment of the proteins to the cell periphery associated with enhanced barrier function. the mechanisms for these two distinct functionalities remain to be explored.
