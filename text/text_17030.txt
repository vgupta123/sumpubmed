BACKGROUND
sexual selection and the evolution of mating specificity are a central focus to evolutionary biology  <cit> . recent advancement in molecular tools allowed for identification of specific genes in several organisms controlling particular stages of male–female interactions at fertilization  and with the aid of next-generation sequencing methods we are now closer to understand the evolution of mating specificity  <cit> . in particular, evolutionary studies of genes involved in recognition between male and female gametes  provide important insights into the evolution of reproductive isolation and speciation. it has been shown, that fertilization genes generally evolve faster and are targets of sexual selection, reinforcement, and other evolutionary forces  which have been shown to be under strong directional selection . research conducted on sea urchin bindin, an acrosomal protein binding in a species-specific manner to a receptor on the egg plasma membrane prior to the fusion, is exemplar in this respect . similarly, studies of the sperm receptor lysin and its egg ligand verl in haliotis revealed a strong excess of nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence  between species driven by positive selection and concerted evolution  <cit> , making it one of the fastest evolving metazoan proteins known. in addition, variable selective pressure exerted on the lysin gene in closely related  and more diverged species  of abalone suggested, that diversifying selection acts on closely related sympatric species, whereas distantly related species are already relieved from it  <cit> . this could be indicative of reinforcement  <cit>  where sex involved genes would be under selective pressure to establish barriers to reproduction in reunited populations.

contrary to the rich literature on grps in marine invertebrates, studies identifying sperm-egg recognition proteins and their putative adaptive evolution are relatively scarce in other branches of the eukaryotic tree. here, we focus on the evolution of genes hypothesized to be involved in sexual reproduction and gamete recognition in the brown algal model ectocarpus sp.   <cit> . brown algae present an opportunity to investigate gamete receptors in a lineage, that has been evolving independently from land plants and animals for over a billion years  <cit> . similarly to sea urchin and abalone, brown algae represent free spawning species with gamete interaction limited to pheromone signalling and surface recognition. although proteins involved in fertilization in brown seaweeds have not been described so far, a number of proteins involved in sperm-egg binding were isolated and partially characterized in fucus , but the underlying genes were never identified. in addition to the studies focusing on fucus, a sexually induced gene  <dig>  in a diatom thalassiosira spp. was shown to have high divergence, both within and between species  <cit> . transcription of the gene is upregulated during mating  <cit> , however its exact function is not known. nevertheless, its extreme divergence indicates a possible function as a barrier to hybridization between geographically distant strains  <cit> . homologs of the family of sig genes have also been found in other stramenopiles, including ectocarpus  <cit> .

ectocarpus is a cosmopolitan genus composed of three recognized species: e. siliculosus, e. fasciculatus and e. crouaniorum. nonetheless, cross-fertilization experiments imply that more species exist in reality  <cit> . previous experiments suggested that gamete recognition is mediated by n-acetylglucosamine  residues exposed on the plasma membrane of the female gametes and a lectin-like receptor at the tip of male anterior flagella  <cit> . however, detailed structural information on the proteins involved and gene sequences for the corresponding receptors are lacking.

here, we used large scale genomic data covering different life stages of ectocarpus  <cit>  to identify genes with expression limited to the male gametic stage, expecting surface receptors mediating fertilization to be expressed uniquely in gametes. these genes  provided a subset to test for divergence and positive selection at the amino acid level using ectocarpus species of known sexual compatibility . we found divergence-based evidence of selective pressure acting on at least one of the investigated genes. interestingly, that gene displayed domain similarities to the receptor for egg jelly  protein involved in sperm-egg recognition in sea urchins  <cit> .table  <dig> strains used in the study

methods
selection of genes of interest
transcriptome data covering male and female gametes  <cit>  as well as gametophyte and sporophyte life stages  <cit>  were compared to obtain a list of male gamete specific genes. an expression filter of rpkm >  <dig> was applied to remove background noise. selected genes were further screened for the presence of transmembrane domains using tmhmm  <cit>  and signal peptides targeting the outer membrane using hectar  <cit> .

dna extraction
dna was extracted from 20–50 mg of culture material  or silica dried specimens . samples were ground in liquid nitrogen and extracted using ctab buffer , followed by two extractions with chloroform:isoamylalcohol . dna was precipitated with 80 % isopropanol and cleaned with qiagen magattract suspension g according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

sequence data collection
to perform pairwise divergence analysis, we used genomic data available for the genome strain ectocarpus sp. linage 1c  <cit>  and ectocarpus siliculosus lineage 1a . the two lineages are considered separate ‘species’ with post-zygotic barriers to reproduction . additionally, cultures of nine ectocarpus strains representing clades 1a, 1c, 2c, 2d,  <dig>  5a and 5b as described by stache crain et al.  <cit>  were retrieved from the culture collection of algae and protozoa  or macroalgal culture collection  for dna extraction. scytosiphon “lomentaria”  was used as an outgroup . primers were designed based on the ectocarpus genome sequence  <cit>  using primer <dig>  <cit>  . gene fragments were amplified from genomic dna using a touch-down pcr procedure with initial denaturation for 3 min at 95 °c followed by 10 cycles of denaturation at 95 °c for 30s, 30s annealing at 65 °c decreasing 1 °c per cycle and elongation at 72 °c for 1 min and then 25 cycles of denaturation at 95 °c for 30s, 30s annealing at 55 °c and elongation at 72 °c for 1 min, with a final elongation step of 10 min at 72 °c. amplicons were sequenced using sanger sequencing. dna chromatograms were edited and checked using bionumerics . sequences can be retrieved under accession numbers ln <dig> - ln <dig>  we refer to the additional file  <dig> for full details.

phylogenetic analyses
sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit  <dig>  were generated for phylogenetic analysis. obtained sequences were compared with ectocarpus sequences in genbank using blastn  <cit> . since bayesian inference and maximum likelihood methods may produce conflicting results, gene sequences were analyzed using both methodologies. maximum likelihood analyses were carried out with raxml version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  on the raxml blackbox server  using the cat model  <cit> . searches were started from  <dig> distinct randomized maximum parsimony starting trees and branch support was assessed with the classic bootstrapping algorithm . bayesian phylogenetic inference was carried out with mrbayes version  <dig>   <cit> . two independent runs, each consisting of four incrementally heated chains, were run for  <dig> million generations using default priors and other settings. trees were sampled every thousand generations. convergence of likelihood and parameter values were assessed with tracer version  <dig>   <cit>  and a suitable burn-in value was chosen . bayesian posterior probabilities for clades were computed from the post burn-in sample of trees and indicated on the maximum likelihood  tree .

divergence and positive selection analyses
to estimate the rates of evolution of putative male reproductive genes , we performed a pairwise dn/ds analysis using coding sequences of ectocarpus sp. genome strain lineage 1c and ectocarpus siliculosus lineage 1a  <cit> . orthologous sequences were aligned using clustalw implemented in mega <dig>  <cit>  and manually curated. a pairwise dn/ds  analysis was performed using phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood   <cit> .

positive selection was estimated by the maximum likelihood method available in codeml, paml  <dig> using the f3x <dig> model of codon frequencies and paired nested site models of sequence evolution   <cit> . nested models were compared using the likelihood ratio test  with either  <dig>  or 4 degrees of freedom . empirical bayes methods allowed for identification of positively selected sites a posteriori  <cit> . codon-based nucleotide alignments were used in conjunction with the species tree . individual exon sequences representing the same gene for a given strain were concatenated using fabox  <cit> .

since signatures of positive selection might be overlooked due to its transient or episodic nature, we performed, in parallel, an analysis of occasional selection at individual sites using meme , implemented in hyphy  <cit>  available at datamonkey.org server  <cit> . the f <dig> codon substitution model was used in hyphy  <cit> .

protein functional characteristics prediction
protein structure prediction was done using phyre <dig>   <cit> . transmembrane helices and their topology were inferred from memsat-svm implemented in phyre <dig> or from the tmhmm server v.  <dig>   <cit> . to determine functional domains we performed a gene ontology  and protein domain search  using blast2go v.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  with an e-value hit filter set to  <dig> e- <dig> 

RESULTS
phylogeny
maximum likelihood and bayesian analyses of the mitochondrial cox <dig> gene dataset yielded essentially the same phylogenetic trees , which divided ectocarpus into  <dig> well-supported clades. the relationships among these clades, however, remained unresolved. each clade is subdivided into subclades, again with near full support. while some of these subclades bear formal taxonomic names , others are known by informal identifiers only. major clades are reproductively isolated by prezygotic barriers. for subclades such data are either not available or no prezygotic barriers were identified by means of no-choice experiments, however, post-zygotic barriers may exist .

screening for candidate reproductive genes
comparative analysis of transcriptomic data of male and female gametes  <cit> , male and female immature gametophytes and sporophyte of ectocarpus  <cit>  identified  <dig> male gamete specific genes. these were investigated further for the presence of signal peptides, transmembrane helixes and functional domains potentially involved in cell-cell recognition. fertilization experiments in ectocarpus have shown the presence of lectin-like receptors in male gametes localized on the anterior flagellum  <cit> . therefore, we restricted the search to male expressed genes coding for extracellular or cell surface proteins with potential receptor activity. with these criteria, twelve out of  <dig> genes were identified as putative gamete recognition genes and were selected for evolutionary analyses together with twelve house-keeping genes as controls . in addition, we included three genes belonging to the sig family , previously described as potential recognition genes in diatoms  <cit> . the ectocarpus genome codes for three sig-like proteins, two of which showed no expression in gametes  and one homolog of sig <dig>  which was found abundant in both male and female gametes. it has to be noted, that during the initial phase of gamete release both male and female gametes are flagellated in ectocarpus. therefore, the presence of sig <dig> in both sexes may indicate a structural role rather than the involvement in gamete recognition as hypothesized by honda et al.  <cit>  and blackman et al.  <cit> .

evolution of putative male receptors
to test for evolutionary divergence of candidate male receptor genes, we calculated levels of nonsynonymous  and synonymous  substitution using pairwise comparisons between ectocarpus sp.  and its sister species ectocarpus siliculosus . overall putative receptor genes showed significantly faster evolutionary rates  compared to housekeeping genes , with sig genes showing the highest sequence conservation among putative receptors. six out of twelve selected male specific genes showed dn/ds ratio > <dig> , which could imply adaptive evolution . it has been shown that the gene length may bias the estimations of dn/ds particularly for short genes with low divergence which are then preferably found to be under positive selection  <cit> . however, higher dn/ds in this study were associated with gois, which were on average substantially longer than housekeeping genes . we therefore believe that the gene length does not have a major influence on the evolutionary rates of the genes analyzed here.table  <dig> parameter estimates under pairwise sequence analysis in codeml, paml  <dig> using ectocarpus siliculosus lineage 1a vs ectocarpus sp. lineage 1c

interspecies polymorphism and evidence for positive selection in esil0130_0068
the esi0130_ <dig> protein consists of  <dig> amino acids and presumably contains  <dig>  or  <dig>  transmembrane domains . the n-terminal region, composed of  <dig> amino acids, is predicted to be located extracellularly. a functional domain scan for this part of the protein identified a gps domain , a rej domain  and a polycystin cation channel  within the rej domain . the n-terminal fragment was targeted for resequencing in representative ectocarpus strains. esi0130_ <dig> showed statistical evidence for adaptive evolution in the paml  <dig> and meme  analysis. however, the latter analysis presented different sites under selection depending on the model used . all models allowing individual sites to evolve under positive selection  gave a significantly better fit to the esi0130_ <dig> data  and identified a substantial proportion of sites with dn/ds > <dig> . this result is consistent with an evolutionary history characterized by frequent episodes of positive selection. all three models  suggest ~7 % of sites under positive selection with ω2 =  <dig>  . the codons inferred to be under positive selection by paml  <dig> with posterior probability >90 % lie within the rej domain in the extracellular region of the protein. sites identified by hyphy are adjacent to the n-terminal site of the rej domain  and are also indicated by the empirical bayes analysis in paml  <dig> with lower probability. noteworthy, sequence analysis of sperm pkdrej in primates also revealed several positively selected sites in the rej domain and its flanking extracellular regions  <cit> .fig.  <dig> posterior means of ω and probabilities for site classes in esi0130_ <dig>  a posterior probabilities for site classes in esi0130_ <dig> as calculated by m <dig>  model in paml. the ω ratios are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . each of the first  <dig> categories has a proportion of  <dig>  and the last category has a proportion of  <dig> . categories are grouped by ω <  <dig> , 1 ≥ ω >  <dig> , ω =  <dig> . b posterior means of ω, calculated as the average over  <dig> site classes. the amino acid sequence represents the genome strain , the site numbers correspond to the position in the coding sequence

discussion
adaptive evolution has commonly been observed in proteins responsible for egg-sperm interactions  with a particularly large proportion of positively selected sites found in the sperm-egg binding moieties . this indicates that gamete recognition might be subject to selective pressure and sexual selection may operate at the gamete level  <cit> .

although proteins responsible for egg-sperm interactions in brown algae have not been identified so far, sig <dig> was originally hypothesized to play a role in gamete adhesion in the diatom thalassiosira  <cit> . sig <dig> shows high nonsynonymous sequence divergence between closely related species of thalassiosira  <cit> . although ectocarpus possesses one homolog of sig <dig> with similar length and domain architecture, no evidence was obtained for positive selection in the c-terminal region . taken into account that sig <dig> is expressed in both types of gametes, these findings support the structural role as mastigoneme proteins rather than their involvement in gamete recognition. it should be noted that the remaining exons , that might bear the positively evolving sites, could not be amplified by pcr from the genomic dna and thus are missing in this analysis.

one of the genes expressed specifically in male gametes  revealed significant variation in selective pressure acting on different amino acids. the changes in the evolutionary rates could be a result of weaker selective constrains acting on esi0130_ <dig> and/or positive selection. the former could be caused by gene expression bias, if deleterious alleles are less effectively removed when expressed only by one sex in the population  <cit> . therefore, gene expression bias could result in relaxation of purifying selection on protein-coding genes. this phenomenon is common in genes with sex-biased expression  and has been observed also in ectocarpus  <cit> . the relaxed selective constrain may also facilitate specialized adaptation  <cit> . to test for signatures of adaptive evolution in the genes of interest, we performed a maximum likelihood test using paml  <cit>  and hyphy  <cit> . both methods found that divergence in esi0130_ <dig> sequence is promoted by adaptive evolution. analysis of dn/ds ratio among individual sites identified particular amino acids with good statistical support of positive selection , indicative of their putative importance for the function of esi0130_ <dig> 

pairwise dn/ds analysis of esi0130_ <dig> showed highest values  in comparisons between closely related strains, which concerns clades 5a, 5b and 2d as well as clades 1a and 1c . while pre-zygotic barriers to fertilization already exist between clades 5a and 2d, clades 1a and 1b are able to form zygotes which are later arrested during development . in this case, excess of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions could be a sign of diversifying selection acting to reinforce reproductive barriers between strains 1a and 1c. similar scenario could account for the high diversity between clades 5a and 5b, however compatibility studies are lacking in this group.

interestingly, esi0130_ <dig> resembles the topology of the egg recognition protein in sea urchin sperm  <cit> . although the exact function of the rej domain containing proteins is unknown in brown algae the unique localization and expression pattern of rej proteins in sea urchins and humans  suggest a central role in fertilization  <cit> . sea urchin sperm contains several members of the rej protein family , out of which sprej <dig> binds a fucose sulfate polymer of the egg jelly, triggering the acrosome reaction and transforming the sperm into a fusogenic cell  <cit> . ectocarpus esi0130_ <dig> protein does not contain the lectin domain upstream of rej, which probably interacts with the female gamete surface glycoprotein in sea urchin, however this domain is also not found in the human hpkdrej. in sea urchins, the carbohydrate recognition domains that are subjected to positive selection  <cit>  in contrast to the sperm pkdrej in primates were positively selected sites are found within and around the rej domain  <cit> . it is unclear at present whether the rej domain itself can take part in the interaction with the egg glycoprotein coat the rej domain has the potential role in regulating the ion channel which triggers the acrosome reaction  <cit> . therefore, the rej domain may be important for triggering the species-specific recognition cascade through control of the ion flux. additionally, almost all of the members of the sprej and human pkd families possess a g-protein coupled receptor cleavage site  upstream of the first transmembrane helix  <cit> . rej domains are predicted to affect the cleavage at the gps site  <cit> , which may be another way of influencing the fertilization process. the presence of a rej domain in combination with a gps motif and possible cation channel function make esi0130_ <dig> an appealing candidate for in situ evaluation.

CONCLUSIONS
this study focused on genes for which there is evidence that expression is limited only to male gametes of ectocarpus and possibly subjected to adaptive evolution. by extrapolation, the observed positive selection may pinpoint the genes that are directly involved in male reproduction, which would be an important step towards understanding the molecular basis of gamete interaction during reproduction in ectocarpus. in particular, one male gamete specific gene  appears to be a good candidate due to signatures of positive selection and its similarity to the sperm-egg recognition protein in sea urchin. however, nucleotide sequences used in this study represent only a partial coding sequence of selected genes in a limited number of strains. future work would require a larger sample size and complete gene sequences for a better estimation of evolution over time and forces shaping the divergence in the sex-related genes in ectocarpus.
