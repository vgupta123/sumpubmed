BACKGROUND
the lc-ms/ms system is one of the most frequently used instruments for shotgun protein identification  <cit> . protein identification by lc-ms/ms analysis consists mainly of the following five steps:  the samples are prepared from protein mixtures by peptide fragmentation with a protease, e.g., trypsin.  in the lc column, the digested peptides are separated according to their hydrophobicity and/or polarity  in the survey scan  mode, the peptides eluted from the lc system are continuously introduced into the mass spectrometer by electrospray ionization .  the detector in the ms- <dig> mode separates peptides according to the mass/charge ratio  and selects the peaks with high intensity.  in the ms/ms  mode, the selected peptides are separated from other components and randomly fragmented by physical impact. the detector integrates the intensity of each fragment, leading to the generation of ms/ms spectra.

recent development of quantitative proteomics technology has made it possible to perform quantitative analysis of large-scale proteome data generated using the lc-ms/ms system. silac  is one of the most effective methods for comparative analysis of the expression status of proteins among samples  <cit> , including time-course analysis  <cit> . the silac method has undergone some modifications. one of the well-modified silac methods is as follows:  target cells are incubated in three types of media, namely, media containing  natural arginine,  arginine containing stable isotope of 13c, or  arginine with two types of stable isotopes, 13c and 15n.  the samples prepared from differentially labeled cells are mixed in equal proportions and introduced into the lc-ms/ms system.  the peak derived from the same amino acid sequence is shifted in proportion to the difference of the number of neutrons between the samples. relative quantitation can be performed by comparing the peak intensities of differentially labeled peptides  <cit> .

the above method is widely used for describing various biological events  <cit> . for example, blagoev et al. reported the global quantitative dynamics of phosphotyrosine-based signaling events by measuring the fold activation of related proteins at different time points  <cit> .

several types of software, e.g., sequest  <cit> , mowse  <cit> , mascot  <cit> , proteinprospector  <cit> , and profound  <cit> , have been developed for protein identification based on ms or ms/ms data. these software tools deduce a corresponding protein/peptide sequence from the measured data and generate a report with additional information, e.g. reliability score, gene id, and modification if any. for quantitation, mzmine version  <dig>  was developed for differential analyses of the lc/ms profile data  <cit> . although this software uses a gui interface with a powerful batch-processing function, its application is restricted to the analyses of lc/ms data. for further analyses using lc-ms/ms in combination with the silac method, msquant  <cit>  has been developed. msquant has a gui interface and runs on windows os. however, this software is not in stable operation and requires a huge memory  to run.

in the present study, we have developed a completely automatic console-based software tool that is highly customized for lc-ms/ms proteome data obtained by the silac method. here we report a new algorithm for peak detection, details of the data analysis pipeline, and a new platform-independent open source software, ayums, developed using this algorithm. furthermore, we compare the results obtained by manual operation with those obtained using this software and discuss the respective performances.

implementation
ayums consists of a series of steps for processing lc-ms/ms data. the scope of this software is focused on data processing for extracting quantitative information from the raw data. therefore, other tools should be used for the statistical analyses based on the information produced by ayums. this software is implemented as a stand-alone java application and requires jre  <dig> . <dig> or higher version. in contrast to msquant , ayums is platform-independent, i.e., it runs on any of windows, unix, or mac os x. in addition, the generation of the final report is completely automatic.

software design
our aim was to develop a software tool that automatically executes the calculation of the peak ratios of differentially labeled peptides analyzed by lc-ms/ms. to achieve this, we adopted a console-based user interface . ayums requires two input files – an lc-ms/ms raw data file and a database search result file containing the information on the identified peptides/proteins. ayums generates an output report in a comma-separated value  format. the flow chart of ayums is shown in figure  <dig> and the contents of the flow chart are described in the following sections.

input data style and conversion of the raw data file
in the first stage , ayums requires two files, namely,  a mascot html file and  a binary file in our original format . for generating the mascot html file, a peak list file is first prepared from the raw ms/ms data file using proteinlynx . this peak list is searched against the protein database using mascot  and the output of the database search is saved as an html file. the binary file is generated by the following two steps: first, the masslynx raw data are converted to ascii style data using databridge in the masslynx package ; subsequently, this ascii data file is converted to the ayums format using the conversion functions in ayums. using a pentium  <dig>  processor, the total time required for the conversion from the raw data to the ascii style by databridge is  <dig> min to  <dig> h, and the time from the ascii style to the ayums format by ayums is  <dig> to  <dig> h.

parsing of mascot html
the mascot html file mainly comprises a list of inferred proteins and their peptides along with the information on the observed molecular weight, the calculated molecular weight, the difference between these two weights, probability-based mowse score, p-value of the score, rank of the matched ion, peptide sequence, and ms/ms spectrum. in stage  <dig>  the mascot html file is parsed to make these data available in ayums. the cyberneko java library developed by andy clark is used as an html parser  <cit> . if the xml format is implemented for the output of mascot, an xml parser library will also be useful.

selection of reliable proteins and their peptides
in stage  <dig>  every matched protein and the list of identified peptides under the defined conditions are extracted from the parsed results of the mascot html data. the criteria for data extraction are as follows:  select protein/peptides with a mascot score higher than a threshold value,  select peptides in higher ranks than a threshold value. the default condition in ayums is set to select all the peptides with a score higher than  <dig> in the top rank.

peak detection and computation
in stage  <dig>  the peaks corresponding to the selected peptides are searched from the raw data and the peak ratios of the differentially labeled peptides are calculated.

the following five steps are applied for each selected peptide.

step 1
based on the mascot data of the selected peptide, the retention time at lc and the m/z value of the peptide are searched from the ayums format of ms- <dig> 

step 2
according to the information on the retention time obtained in step  <dig>  the nearest time point is searched from the ayums format of ms- <dig>  leading to the acquisition of the spectrum corresponding to the target peptide.

step 3
the spectra around this time point are sequentially searched. a specific algorithm, the details of which are described below, calculates a score for each spectrum and selects the best spectrum.

the spectrum consists of a set of peaks with each individual m/z value and intensity. all the intensities within a certain range of m/z value  from the target peak are integrated. each peptide is differentially displayed in three distinct forms that are derived from three types of stably labeled arginine . according to the information in the mascot result, the identified peptide form and its differentially labeled ones are specified in the spectrum based on the principle that the differences of molecular weight between 12c14n - 13c14n and 13c14n - 13c15n are 6da and 4da, respectively .

in addition, as proteins/peptides are made of some natural isotopes, each peak is accompanied by sub-peaks which shift  <dig> da and  <dig> da in the spectrum. the intensities of these peaks are all integrated as the total quantity of the target peptide.

step 4
the spectra adjacent to the best spectrum are recursively selected as long as the score ratio of the investigated spectrum to the best one is higher than a constant value , which we term the acceptable ratio. based on the data of the acceptable spectra, the intensities for three types of differentially labeled peptides are independently integrated.

step 5
based on the result in step  <dig>  the average ratios of 13c14n and 13c15n to 12c14n and their standard deviations are calculated.

algorithm
the procedure for step  <dig> to step  <dig> is described in the following algorithm.

n :=  <dig> 

r :=  <dig> 

r <dig> :=  <dig> 

r <dig> := 3

r <dig> := 10

in order to evaluate the performance of the automatic calculation by ayums, we used three sets of time-series data on the phosphotyrosine-related proteome. a <dig> cells differentially labeled with stable isotopes of arginine were stimulated with epidermal growth factor  for different time periods, followed by affinity-purification of signaling molecules with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. after direct digestion of the proteins, protein identification and quantification were performed by nanolc-ms/ms analysis . figure  <dig> shows the activation profile of phosphorylated proteins with the top six mascot scores . figures  <dig> and  <dig> show the results obtained by manual operation and by ayums, respectively. from the experimental data,  <dig> proteins were detected by database search against the refseq human protein database . in the pre-process, our algorithm removed  <dig> proteins with a mascot score less than the threshold . the remaining  <dig> phosphorylated proteins were then quantified by manual operation as well as by ayums. as shown in figure  <dig>  the results obtained by these two methods showed good correlation .

although the results for some proteins did not correlate well , the shapes of the activation change between the two methods matched each other in most cases. it should be noted that ayums enabled us to eliminate the necessity for manual operation. in other words, reliable quantitation results were obtained in a high-throughput fashion that had never been achieved previously.

the poor correlation for some proteins was mainly due to the existence of noise peaks. the background noise has a substantial influence on quantitation, especially in the case of low-abundance peaks. the contaminant noise derived from other peptides also affects the calculation. although our instrument operates with high mass resolution  and accuracy , it is difficult to distinguish the other peaks with adjacent m/z values. although it is possible to remove unreliable data when performing analysis manually, our algorithm does not have a function to eliminate them efficiently. some statistical methods are necessary to deal with this problem.

discussion
reduction of difficulties
the major contributions of this study are as follows:  drastic reduction in the manual work required to perform quantitation for large-scale proteome data and  reproducibility of high-quality data that does not depend on the user. in the case of this study, it required 2– <dig> working days to create the activation profile of the phosphotyrosine-related proteome by manual operation. in contrast, ayums could automatically generate the final report within  <dig> hours using a single machine. it is also possible to perform quantitation in parallel for multiple experimental data. for example, if two machines are available,  <dig> hours are sufficient for the generation of the final result.

once the ayums format file is created, the subsequent analysis can be completed within  <dig> minutes. thus, it is possible to easily re-evaluate experimental data by changing various options such as the acceptable ratio in step  <dig> of stage  <dig> and the threshold of the mascot score.

future studies
although a completely automatic quantitation based on the lc-ms/ms data was realized using ayums  <dig> , further development of this software is required at various points. first, although the input of stage  <dig> in ayums supports only the q-tof type raw data, it needs to handle major data formats by netcdf for more general purposes. second, it would be very helpful to generate the final result not only in the csv file format but also in other major formats, such as mzxml  <cit> , for better usability.

the present silac method enables us to compare only two or three samples in a single experiment. relative quantitation of target proteins at multiple points such as in dynamics analysis requires a common standard point to normalize the results of separate experiments. ayums will need to support a function of statistical data processing of the normalized results for more precise quantitation.

although ayums is customized for the silac method, it can also easily handle the data obtained by other labeling strategies such as isotope-coded affinity tags   <cit> , isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation   <cit> , and culture-derived isotope tags   <cit> .

this software is open to public access; hence, any researcher can contribute to the development of its application.

CONCLUSIONS
ayums is a useful software tool for quantitative proteomics by lc-ms/ms technology in combination with the silac method. this software completely eliminates the need for manual work that has always been required previously. besides, it enables us to obtain the final result considerably faster than by manual operation. our evaluation of the output data by ayums indicated that it ranked comparably with the results calculated by an expert in proteomics.
