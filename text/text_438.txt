BACKGROUND
the plant mildew locus o  gene family codes for proteins harboring seven transmembrane domains and a calmodulin-binding site, topologically reminiscent of metazoan and fungal g-protein coupled receptors   <cit> . following the completion of plant genome sequencing projects, a number of homologs varying from  <dig> to  <dig> has been identified in the mlo gene families of diploid species, namely arabidopsis, rice, grapevine, cucumber, peach, woodland strawberry and sorghum .

specific homologs of the mlo gene family act as susceptibility factors towards fungi causing the powdery mildew  disease, worldwide spread and causing severe losses in agricultural settings. inactivation of these genes, through loss-of function mutations or silencing, indeed results in resistance  in several plant species  <cit> . the first mlo gene described as required for pm pathogenesis was barley hvmlo  <cit> . since then, mlo susceptibility genes have been functionally characterized in rice , wheat , arabidopsis , tomato , pepper , tobacco , pea , lotus  and barrel clover  .

defense mechanisms involved in mlo-based resistance prevent fungal penetration in epidermal cells and are associated with the formation of cell wall appositions, referred to as papillae  <cit> . similar pre-penetration defense measures also take place in non-host resistance, following the interaction between pm fungal species and plant species beyond their host range. consistent with the hypothesis of involvement of mlo genes in non-host resistance, loss of function of hvmlo in the interaction between barley and the wheat pm fungus blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici is associated with decreased rate of penetration and lower incidence of epidermal cell death, the latter being a post-penetration defense mechanism  <cit> .

several studies have been addressed to the characterization of regions of relevance for the functionality of mlo proteins. multiple alignments have pointed out the occurrence of residues highly conserved within the whole mlo family, which were therefore predicted to provide a common protein structural scaffold  <cit> . in addition, the occurrence of residues and motifs specifically conserved in putative orthologs of barley hvmlo has been reported  <cit> . finally, functionally important residues for mlo susceptibility proteins have been inferred by the association of naturally occurring and induced mutations with partial or complete pm resistance .

in our previous studies, we showed that phylogenetically related dicot mlo genes of the same botanic family are conserved for their function as a susceptibility gene to pm  <cit> . notably, monocot and dicot mlo proteins involved in pm susceptibility group in clearly separated phylogenetic clades . here, we show that the evolution of angiosperm pm susceptibility genes led to the fixation of class-specific molecular traits. many of them appear to be the result of negative selection. by means of transgenic complementation assays, we demonstrate that, despite having different conservation patterns, monocot and dicot mlo susceptibility genes are essentially conserved with respect to functional features having a role in interactions with pm fungi. consequences of our findings for plant breeding research are discussed.

RESULTS
class-specific molecular features of angiosperm mlo homologs required for pm susceptibility
previous studies indicated that dicot and monocot mlo proteins with a putative or ascertained role in susceptibility to pm fungi group in two different phylogenetic clades . this was confirmed by performing a new upgma-based phylogenetic analysis involving all the  <dig> mlo homologs which have been until recently functionally related to pm susceptibility . aiming to detect molecular features responsible for such phylogenetic divergence, the same mlo homologs were used as dataset for protein multiple alignment . notably, this led to the identification of  <dig> alignment positions in which residues invariable throughout dicots are absent in monocots, and  <dig> alignment positions in which residues invariable throughout monocots are absent in dicots. in  <dig> alignment positions, class-specific residues are replaced in the other class with residues having different properties, according to the chemical features of their side-chain group .fig.  <dig> unrooted radial phylogenetic tree of mlo powdery mildew susceptibility proteins. the tree includes, in red, all the monocot and dicot mlo homologs shown to be required for powdery mildew susceptibility , and the remaining homologs of the arabidopsis atmlo family. numbers at each node represent bootstrap support values

adaptive relevance of class-specific molecular features supported by evolutionary analysis
in order to make inference on the evolutionary events leading to the above mentioned class-specific molecular features, we performed a codon-based single-likelihood ancestor counting  analysis on the difference of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous and synonymous sites . tests were conducted to predict the evolution of each codon: neutral/dn = ds or negative /dn < ds. we decided to restrict the analysis to a panel of nine dicot mlo susceptibility genes, as only four monocot mlo homologs have been so far associated with pm pathogenesis and the dn-ds analysis can provide significant results only when using a sequence dataset which is not too small. we found  <dig> codons under significant negative selection, coding for amino acids scattered throughout mlo protein domains. among the  <dig> codons,  <dig> are translated into class-specific residues, which are therefore predicted to provide an adaptive value .

functional conservation of monocot and dicot mlo susceptibility genes
we tested whether different molecular features between monocot and dicot mlo proteins are specifically required by pm fungal species infecting either one or the other class of angiosperms. to this aim, we developed two constructs for the transgenic expression of a monocot  and a dicot  mlo gene in the tomato slmlo <dig> line, which is homozygous for a loss-of-function mutation in the endogenous gene slmlo <dig> and therefore resistant to the tomato pm fungus oidium neolycopersici. we reasoned that complementation and restoration of pm symptoms would have occurred only in case of functional conservation between slmlo <dig> and any of the two tested transgenes. in total, nineteen 35s::psmlo <dig> and  <dig> 35s::hvmlo transformants were obtained. in both cases,  <dig> individuals were obtained showing variable transgene expression levels. for each construct, three t <dig> plants displaying high transgene expression  were self-pollinated to generate t <dig> families . ten individuals from each t <dig> family were tested for the presence or the absence of the transgene and challenged with o. neolycopersici. transgenic individuals of the three t <dig> families overexpressing psmlo <dig> ) displayed pm symptoms with an average d.i.  score ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . transgenic individuals of the three t <dig> families overexpressing hvmlo ) showed an average d.i. score ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . in contrast, all non-transgenic 35s::psmlo1_ and 35s::hvmlo_ t <dig> individuals displayed, similar to the slmlo <dig> plants, hardly any fungal growth . for transgenic plants of the three 35s::hvmlo t <dig> families, positive correlation was found between average d.i. and transgene expression level of corresponding t <dig> plants . together, these results indicate that monocot and dicot mlo susceptibility genes are functionally conserved with respect to molecular features required for pm pathogenesis.fig.  <dig> transgenic overexpression of pea psmlo <dig> and barley hvmlo in the tomato mutant line slmlo <dig>  panel a shows the phenotypes of two selected individuals of the t <dig> family 35s::psmlo1- <dig>  segregating for the presence  or the absence  of the transgene, two selected individuals of the t <dig> family 35s::hvmlo- <dig>  segregating for the presence  or the absence  of the transgene, and one individual of the slmlo <dig> line , in response to the tomato powdery mildew fungus oidium neolycopersici. panel b from left to right shows average disease index  values relative to transgenic plants  of the 35s::psmlo1-7 t <dig> family, non-transgenic plants  of three t <dig> families segregating for the 35s::psmlo <dig> construct, transgenic plants of the 35s::hvmlo-9 t <dig> family, non-transgenic plants of three t <dig> families segregating for the 35s::hvmlo construct and the slmlo <dig> line. standard deviation bars refer to six 35s::psmlo1_ individuals, nine 35s::hvmlo_ individuals,  <dig> psmlo1_ individuals,  <dig> hvmlo_ individuals and  <dig> slmlo <dig> individuals



functional conservation of monocot and dicot mlo susceptibility genes in non-host interactions
we next investigated whether functional conservation between monocot and dicot mlo homologs also holds true in non-host plant-pm interactions. to this aim, we used the pm species b. graminis f.sp. hordei  to inoculate plants of the slmlo <dig> mutant line, the cultivar moneymaker , carrying wild-type slmlo <dig>  and two of the 35s::hvmlo t <dig> families . bgh is an adapted pm on barley and a non-adapted pm to tomato. in the slmlo <dig> line,  <dig>  % of infection units were associated with papilla formation and  <dig>  % with cell death response . compared with the slmlo <dig> line, transgenic 35s::hvmlo-9 t <dig> plants displayed a lower level of papilla formation  and a higher level of cell death response . in mm, papilla formation and cell death occurred at a rate similar to the one in 35s::hvmlo- <dig> plants . taken together, this body of evidence indicates that both hvmlo and slmlo <dig> predispose to the penetration of a non-host pathogen.fig.  <dig> functional conservation of slmlo <dig> and hvmlo in the tomato/blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei  interaction. panel a shows the ratio of penetrated and non-penetrated epidermal cells, assessed in function of infection units showing hypersensitive response  and papillae, respectively, in the following genotypes: the mlo mutant line slmlo1; the cultivar mm, with a similar genetic background and carrying wild-type slmlo1; transgenic plants of a t <dig> family overexpressing barley hvmlo in the slmlo <dig> genetic background . panel b, c and d show, in the same genotypes, fungal structures  and cellular events  arresting fungal growth before and after penetration, respectively



discussion
the functional characterization of mlo homologs involved in pm susceptibility is of great interest for basic research on plant-microbe interactions as well as for plant breeding, as loss-of-function genotypes could be conveniently used to introduce durable and broad-spectrum resistance in cultivated species  <cit> . results of previous investigations indicated that mlo-based resistance in a certain plant species can be lost by the heterologous expression of mlo susceptibility genes from related species of the same botanical family. indeed, restored susceptibility has been observed in barley hvmlo mutants transformed with wheat tamlo_b <dig> and rice osmlo <dig>  as well as in pea psmlo <dig> mutants expressing lotus ljmlo <dig> or barrel clover mtmlo <dig> <cit> . recently, similar evidence was shown on tomato slmlo <dig> mutants transformed with pepper camlo <dig> or tobacco ntmlo <dig>  <cit> . here, we investigated whether complementation can also occur by transferring mlo genes from more evolutionary divergent plant species. we found that, in a tomato mlo mutant background, transgenic expression of a mlo susceptibility gene from pea  and barley  is sufficient to re-establish pm susceptibility . this finding indicates that, despite phylogenetic distance and the evolution of peculiar molecular traits , monocot and dicot mlo proteins are essentially conserved with respect to features involved in the interaction with pm pathogens. in support of this conclusion, we show that the monocot gene hvmlo and the dicot gene slmlo <dig> both enhance penetration of the non-adapted pathogen b. graminis f.sp. hordei compared to a tomato mlo-mutant . moreover, after reviewing scientific literature, we found that only one out of thirty mlo protein substitutions so far associated with pm resistance involves a class-specific residue    <cit> . the same residue is replaced in dicots by a glycine , indicating that, in this case, class-specific conservations are not associated with important changes in protein structure or function.table  <dig> amino acid residues in dicot atmlo <dig> and monocot hvmlo whose mutation has been associated with pm resistance. for each amino-acid, localization in any of the mlo protein domains, including seven transmembrane  regions, three extracellular loops , three intracellular  loops, the n-terminus and the c-terminus, is indicated

apartial resistance observed in barley, bfull resistance observed in arabidopsis



we cannot exclude that class-specific traits might have minor effects on interactions with pm fungi. indeed, by comparing three independent t <dig> families for each construct, we found that that overexpression of psmlo <dig> results in higher d.i. index scores than the one of hvmlo . clearly, complementation tests with several other monocot and dicot transgenes could help to answer this question.

through the analysis of the dn-ds difference, we provide evidence for negative selection acting on several class-specific residues, which are thus likely to play a major adaptive role . however, as mentioned before, transgenic complementation tests indicate that these class-specific residues are not crucial for the outcome of the interaction between plants and pm pathogens. possibly, some of the class-specific residues identified in this study might underlie roles which are not related with the interaction with pm fungi. the implication of mlo susceptibility proteins in other physiological processes would explain why, in spite of being required for pathogenesis, they have been not excluded by evolution. with this respect, it is worth to mention that pm resistance in arabidopsis and barley mlo mutants has been associated with the induction of leaf senescence, a pleiotropic phenotype  <cit> .

we show that mlo homologs required for pm pathogenesis can complement a mlo mutant background in transgenic assays, irrespective of the phylogenetic distance between the donor and the recipient species . this would be of great advantage in order to test the function of candidate mlo susceptibility genes which are currently being identified by several authors across cultivated species  <cit> . moreover, we provide an overview of mlo protein regions which are under negative selection and thus are expected to be of functional relevance. these regions represent ideal targets to select loss-of-function mutants resistant to the pm disease. with this respect, breeders may apply diverse tools, such as conventional targeted mutagenesis approaches of tilling  or advanced technologies of genome editing, based on zinc finger nucleases , clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat  and transcription activator-like effector nucleases  .

CONCLUSIONS
this work provides insights on the evolution and function of angiosperm mlo susceptibility genes. we show that complementation assays similar to those carried out in this study are suitable for future activities aimed at the characterization of novel pm susceptibility factors across cultivated species. moreover, we indicate a series of gene targets for the selection of loss-of-function mlo resistant mutants.
