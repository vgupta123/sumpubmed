BACKGROUND
micrornas , generally 21- <dig> nt in length, spatiotemporally regulate gene expression at transcriptional and/or posttranscriptional level in most eukaryotes  <cit> . they play important roles in plant development, nutrient homeostasis, responses to biotic and abiotic stresses and antibacterial reactions  <cit> . most mirnas are transcribed by rna polymerase ii  from intergenic regions  <cit> . like messenger rnas , primary mirna  transcripts possess 5' caps and 3' poly tails  <cit> . pri-mirnas are processed into imperfect hairpin precursor mirnas  and then double-stranded mirna:mirna* duplexes by dicer-like  <dig>  protein  <cit> . the duplexes are exported into the cytoplasm by hasty. one selected strand of the duplexes  is recruited by the argonaute <dig>  protein to form the so-called rna-induced silencing complex   <cit> . mature mirnas guide the complexes to target mrnas by base complementarity for direct cleavage or translational repression  <cit> .

identification of conserved and novel mirnas usually relies on two approaches: bioinformatic prediction and experimental sequencing. in silico prediction of mirnas includes searching genomic or est databases for orthologous sequences of known mirnas and analyzing their pre-mirna hairpin structures  <cit> . the limitation of this approach is that only highly conserved mirnas can be identified. the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies, such as massively parallel signature sequencing ,  <dig> and sequencing-by-synthesis , has greatly accelerated the discovery of medium-to-low abundant and species-specific mirnas from diverse plants, e.g., triticum aestivum, tomato and oryza sativa  <cit> . for plant species with complete genome information, conserved and novel mirnas can be conveniently identified based on their alignments to the genome and known mirnas in the mirbase and analysis of their pre-mirna stem-loop structures.

hundreds of mirnas have been identified and characterized in model angiosperms, such as arabidopsis, rice and poplar  <cit> . however, few reports involving mirnas in conifers and other gymnosperms exist. a total of  <dig> mirnas from the stem xylem of pinus taeda have been identified and the expression of  <dig> mirna families was significantly repressed in the galled stem  <cit> . stage-specific modulation of specific mirnas and mirna biogenesis components in zygotic embryos and female gametophytes of p. taeda were demonstrated to play vital roles during embryogenesis and seed development  <cit> . morin et al. reported  <dig> candidate novel mirna families from pinus contorta  <cit> . by sequencing of small rna libraries constructed from a taxus chinensis cell line, qiu et al. found that the expression levels of  <dig> mirnas were down-regulated whereas that of  <dig> mirnas were up-regulated after treatment with methyl jasmonate  <cit> . in pinus abies,  <dig> novel and  <dig> conserved mirnas were identified, and  <dig> conserved and  <dig> novel mirnas were found participating in epigenetic regulation  <cit> .

pinus densata is an ecologically important conifer. it represents a highly successful case of homoploid hybrid speciation with far-reaching evolutionary consequences  <cit> . but to date, little is known about its transcriptional sequence information. global identification of pinus densata mirnas has not been reported in previous research. to gain the knowledge of its mrna transcriptome, we recently performed a high-throughput sequencing of mrnas isolated from p. densata needles. the present study was designed to identify p. densata mirnas from the mrna transcriptome database. subcloning and sequencing were conducted to further confirm the pri- and/or pre-mirna sequences. meanwhile, using real-time rt-pcr, the expression profiles of  <dig> mirnas in p. densata seedling tissues were examined. we have also predicted mirna targets and  <dig> target mrnas were experimentally validated by 5' race. our study is the first comprehensive investigation of mirnas in p. densata, which not only forms a solid base for further study of regulative functions of mirnas in the development and growth, but also expands our knowledge of conifer mirnas.

RESULTS
transcriptome-wide survey of mirnas in p. densata
using illumina sequencing technology, we obtained  <dig> , <dig> raw sequences and  <dig>  consensus-genes, including  <dig> clusters and  <dig>  singletons, from a p. densata mrna library. to identify conserved mirnas, we used  <dig> , <dig> sequences as query against mature and precursor sequences in the public microrna database , which contains  <dig> mirnas across  <dig> plant species  <cit> . a total of  <dig> conserved mirnas were identified comprising  <dig> mirna families. the sequences of mature, pre- and pri-mirnas are shown in table  <dig> additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig> respectively. the length of p. densata mirna precursors ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nt, with a majority of them  ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nt. it is consistent with that observed in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . the minimal folding free energy indices  of p. densata mirna precursors varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an average value of  <dig> . it is similar to that of other plant mirnas, such as arabidopsis, rice, glycine max, medicago truncatula, saccharum officinarum, sorghum bicolor and zea mays  <cit> . the hairpin structures of p. densata mirna precursors predicted by mfold are shown in additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  the length of p. densata mature mirnas varied from  <dig> to  <dig> nt, with  <dig>  and  <dig>  nt ones as the two major size classes . notably,  <dig>  mirnas start with a 5' terminal uridine residue, a characteristic feature of mirnas recognized by the ago <dig> protein. these results imply that the identified p. densata mirnas may be canonical.

*ath, osa, ptc, vvi, pta and pab are the abbreviations for a. thaliana, o. sativa, p. trichocarpa, vitis vinifera, p. taeda and p. abies, respectively. the plus symbols indicate: ++, mirnas identical to known mirnas in other plant species; +, mirnas homologous to known mirnas in other plant species. a is a novel member of corresponding mirna family. b  <dig>  Â±  <dig>  is the average and standard deviation of mfei values of pre-mirnas.

sequences of mirnas within a family are identical or nearly identical and mismatched nucleotides between two mirna family members are up to  <dig>  <cit> . through the analysis of the  <dig> p. densata mirna precursors, we identified  <dig> novel mature mirnas belonging to  <dig> conserved mirna families. it includes pde-mir159a, pde-mir169a, pde-mir396a, pde-mir482c, pde-mir482d, pde-mir949a, pde-mir950a, pde-mir952a, pde-mir952b, pde-mir952c, pde-mir <dig>  pde-mir1314a, pde-mir <dig>  pde-mir2118a, pde-mir2118b, pde-mir <dig>  pde-mir3704a, pde-mir3704b and pde-mir <dig> , of which  <dig> mirnas were further validated by subcloning and sequencing except pde-mir396a and pde-mir482c. interestingly, each mirna family contains diverse members in p. densata . for example, the pde-mir <dig> family has  <dig> members, whereas only one exists in  <dig> mirna families .

we identified several singleton sequences from the p. densata mrna transcriptome database highly homologous with the precursors of p. taeda or p. abies mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  in addition, seven contig sequences identical to or highly homologous to osa-mir156k, osa-mir399a, osa-mir <dig>  pta-mir <dig>  cre-mir <dig>  pta-mir <dig> and pta-mir <dig> were also found in the database . however, they were not able to form canonical secondary hairpin structures. therefore, we excluded them from the mirna candidate list.

in this study, we have tried to identify novel mirnas in p. densata. because of the lack of srna database of p. densata,  <dig> and  <dig> small rnas from pinus taeda and picea abies, two evolutionally related species from pinaceae, were downloaded and used in the analysis as described above  <cit> . no novel mirna was found, which could be attributed to insufficient small rnas and the limited number of mrnas in the p. densata transcriptome database.

validation of pri- and pre-mirna sequences
we carried out subcloning experiments to validate the pri- and pre-mirna sequences. the pri-mirna sequences of  <dig> mirnas, including pde-mir159a, pde-mir166a, pde-mir166b, pde-mir169a, pde-mir171a, pde-mir482a, pde-mir482b, pde-mir482d, pde-mir <dig>  pde-mir946a, pde-mir <dig>  pde-mir949a, pde-mir949b, pde-mir <dig>  pde-mir952a, pde-mir <dig>  pde-mir <dig>  pde-mir1312a, pde-mir <dig>  pde-mir <dig>  pde-mir2118a, pde-mir2118b, pde-mir <dig>  pde-mir3704a and pde-mi <dig>  and the pre-mirna sequence of pde-mir <dig> were experimentally confirmed. three novel pri-mirna sequences, pde-mir952b, pde-mir952c and pde-mir3704b were identified when sequencing the clones for pde-mir952a and pde-mir3704a. seven of the  <dig> validated sequences were identical to the sequences obtained from illumina sequencing, whereas  <dig> of which had less than  <dig> mismatched nucleotides and  <dig> of which had more than  <dig> mismatched nucleotides, which might be partially attributed to sequence assembly mistakes during the illumina sequencing. the pre-mirna sequences of  <dig> mirnas, pde-mir162a, pde-mir390a, pde-mir396a, pde-mir482c and pde-mir1314a could not be amplified from total rnas of two-month-old seedling stems, although we repeated our experiments. it could be due to their tissue-specific expressions or limited information for primer design.

intriguingly, the precursor sequences of pde-mir482b and pde-mir2118b were found clustered in a single contig , while the antisense strand of which harbored the precursor sequence of pde-mir3704a . since the primary sequences of pde-mir482b and pde-mir3704a were confirmed, it might be reasonable to deduce that the three mirna precursors were genuine precursors. singletons <dig> was also predicted containing precursor sequences of  <dig> mirnas, pde-mir482d, pde-mir <dig> and pde-mir2118a. its sequence was validated by both illumina sequencing and subcloning. similar phenomenon was also reported in p. taeda  <cit> .

expression patterns of mirnas
in order to obtain solid evidence to support the existence and expression of conserved mirnas in p. densata, we examined the expression profiles of  <dig> mature mirnas  in needles and stems of two-month-old seedlings, using real-time rt-pcr . our results demonstrated that  <dig> of them had higher expression levels in needles than in stems except pde-mir <dig>  the expression levels of  <dig> mirnas, including pde-mir159a, pde-mir166a, pde-mir390a, pde-mir <dig>  pde-mir <dig>  pde-mir <dig> and pde-mir1314b, were more than 2-fold higher in needles than in stems, intriguingly, mir166a, an important mirna known for the functions in establishment of adaxial/abaxial  leaf polarity, was expressed more than  <dig> times higher in needles than in stems  <cit> . the result suggests that pde-mir <dig> may play key roles in a variety of physiological processes in p. densata needles.

prediction of mirna targets
to better understand the functions of p. densata mirnas, we predicted their targets using the web-based program psrnatarget http://bioinfo <dig> noble.org/psrnatarget/index.php?function=function <dig> <cit> . a total of  <dig> , <dig> sequences from the p. densata mrna transcriptome database and  <dig> mature mirnas were used as a custom target database and a custom mirna database respectively. seventy-two mrnas were predicted to be targets of  <dig> mirna families , of which  <dig>  targets were homologous to previously validated or predicted mirna targets in a. thaliana, o. sativa, p. trichocarpa, p. taeda, p. abies and/or t. chinensis . it includes dcl <dig> targeted by pde-mir <dig>  gras family transcription factor cleaved by pde-mir <dig>  class iii hd-zip protein hdz <dig> regulated by pde-mir <dig> and cc-nbs-lrr resistance-like protein sliced by pde-mir <dig>  searching target enrichment in the gene ontology  http://www.geneontology.org/ showed that these conserved targets were involved in a variety of physiological processes in plants. the number of conserved targets of each mirna family varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  pde-mir <dig> family had three conserved targets. pde-mir <dig> family had two conserved targets, while pde-mir <dig> and pde-mir <dig> families each had only one conserved target.

singletons <dig> 
a all predicted mirna targets with penalty scores  of three or less are listed.

*ath, osa, ptc, pta, tch and pab are the abbreviations for a. thaliana, o. sativa, p. trichocarpa, p. taeda, t. chinensis and p. abies, respectively.

the other  <dig> mrnas targeted by  <dig> p. densata mirna families showed no similarity to other plant mirna targets. these targets were predicted to play essential roles in multiple physiological processes. the cc-nbs-lrr resistance-like protein and disease resistance protein targeted by pde-mir <dig> family mirnas appeared to be involved in defense response. other putative targets include anion exchanger family protein, atp binding protein and chaperone clpb. forty-two predicted target mrnas encode hypothetical or unknown function proteins. no targets were found for  <dig> mirna families, including pde-mir <dig>  pde-mir <dig>  pde-mir <dig>  pde-mir <dig> and pde-mir <dig>  it could be due to insufficient mrnas in the mrna transcriptome database.

validation of mirna-guided cleavage of mrna
mature mirnas can direct risc complexes to slice target mrnas or inhibit their translations through nucleotide complementarity  <cit> . the cleavage site primarily locates to the 10th mirna nucleotide from the 5'-end. to verify that mirnas can regulate their target mrna expression in p. densata by cleavage, we carried out a modified rlm-5' race experiment, using total rnas extracted from seedlings   <cit> .

in the present study, we successfully detected the cleavage sites in four predicted target genes of p. densata . singletons <dig>  singletons <dig>  singletons <dig> and singletons <dig> were confirmed to be targets of pde-mir171a, pde-mir162a and pde-mir482a, respectively. we observed a shorter or longer cleaved sequence for three putative targets, singletons <dig>  singletons <dig> and singletons <dig>  after 5' race analysis. it could be attributed to secondary sirna in the 21-nucleotide register with the cleavage site for mirnas, as reported by ronemus and de paola  <cit> . singletons <dig> is similar to plant proteins coded by gras family transcription factor protein, while singletons <dig>  singletons <dig> and singletons <dig> coded for proteins homologous to actin binding protein, nodal modulator 1-like protein and histone deacetylase, respectively.

discussion
conserved mirnas in p. densata
previous studies have identified thousands of mirnas in angiosperms and some of them have been well-characterized  <cit> . few mirnas from gymnosperms have been reported to date  <cit> . p. densata is an ecologically important conifer in east asia. it is an ideal model plant to study homoploid hybrid speciation. however, only  <dig> est sequences are available in the public databases to date. no mirnas from p. densata has been reported in previous research. in order to obtain global mrnas from p. densata, we recently sequenced an mrna library constructed from total rnas of needles using the illumina high-throughput sequencing technology. since pri-mirna sequences also possess poly tails and thus can be isolated and sequenced as mrnas, it allows us to identify candidate pri-mirna sequences from the p. densata mrna transcriptome database by bioinformatics tools  <cit> . in this study, a total of  <dig> conserved mirnas belonging to  <dig> mirna families were identified from p. densata. the primary and/or precursor sequences of  <dig> mirnas were further confirmed by subcloning and sequencing. in addition,  <dig> novel mature mirnas belonging to  <dig> conserved mirna families were found through the analysis of their precursor sequences. the  <dig> pre-mirna sequences could form hairpin structures as predicted by mfold. they had an average mfei value of  <dig>  . nineteen mature mirnas  had a 5' terminal uridine residual, which is a characteristic feature of typical mirnas. these results indicate that the  <dig> candidate mirnas may be canonical. the mirnas identified in the present study can definitely provide useful information for further study on their regulative functions and biogenesis of them.

among the  <dig> mirna families conserved between dicots and monocots,  <dig> of which were identified in p. densata. it includes pde-mir <dig>  pde-mir <dig>  pde-mir <dig>  pde-mir <dig>  pde-mir <dig>  pde-mir <dig>  pde-mir <dig> and pde-mir <dig>  it indicates that the ancient mirna regulatory system is well-developed in the common ancestors of gymnosperms and angiosperms  <cit> . compared with p. taeda and p. abies mirna families listed in mirbase version  <dig>  five new families  were only found in p. densata  <cit> . three p. taeda mirna families, including pta-mir <dig>  pta-mir <dig> and pta-mir <dig>  were not found in p. densata. it could be due to the simplicity of tissue used for illumina sequencing.

we also found a few contigs highly homologous to  <dig> conserved mirnas. they were excluded for further analysis because they were not able to form canonical hairpin structures. with whole genome sequences and larger est databases, more mirnas will be identified from p. densata.

expression profiles of mirnas
in the present study, we found the expression levels of  <dig> conserved mirnas were more than 2-fold higher in needles than in stems, using real time rt-pcr. it suggests that these conserved mirnas may play specific roles in a variety of physiological processes in needles. previous publications have shown that many mirnas have important functions in the establishment of leaf polarity and virus-induced leaf curling. zma-mir166a is an important mirna known for establishing the adaxial/abaxial  leaf polarity by repressing the expression of class iii homeodomain leucine zipper  transcription factors in maize  <cit> . the accumulation of mir <dig> was observed to increase with the days post inoculation  of tomato leaf curl new delhi virus  agroinfection in tomato cv pusa ruby  <cit> . in our study, pde-mir <dig> and pde-mir166a were found highly expressed in p. densata needles. meanwhile, singletons <dig>  coding for a protein highly homologous to class iii hd-zip protein hdz <dig>  was predicted to be the target of pde-mir166a. these results suggest that the two mirnas may also involve in needle polarity establishment and antiviral reaction in p. densata.

mirna targets and their putative functions
to define and elucidate the putative functions for a mirna in plant, a necessary step is to predict and validate its target mrnas. currently, the most efficient tool available for this purpose is the bioinformatics approach, which is based on perfect or near perfectly complementarity between mirnas and their targets. in this study, we predicted mirna targets in p. densata using an online mirna target search program, psrnatarget  <cit> . our results showed that p. densata mirna targets encoded not only indispensable transcription factors, but also non-transcriptional factor proteins involving in diverse physiological processes. for example, hd-zip and gras family transcription factors, which are important to root and nodule development in medicago truncatula and nutrient homeostasis in maize, were predicted to be targets of pde-mir <dig> and pde-mir <dig>  respectively  <cit> . non-transcriptional factor proteins, such as dcl <dig> and cc-nbs-lrr resistance-like protein, were predicted to be targets of pde-mir <dig> and pde-mir <dig>  respectively  <cit> . dcl <dig> is one of the essential components involving in the mirna biogenesis. the prediction of dcl <dig> to be the target of pde-mir <dig> implies that the mirna biogenesis process is self-regulated in p. densata.

to validate the mirna targets in p densata, we performed a modified rlm-5' race experiment. in the present study,  <dig> mirna targets, including singletons <dig>  singletons <dig>  singletons <dig> and singletons <dig> were confirmed to be targets of pde-mir171a, pde-mir162a and pde-mir482a, respectively. these results suggest that mirnas can regulate the expression of their targets by cleavage in p. densata.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we performed a transcriptome-wide identification and characterization of mirnas from p. densata. a total of  <dig> conserved mirnas comprising  <dig> mirna families were identified. the primary and/or precursor sequences of  <dig> mirnas were confirmed by subcloning and sequencing. analysis of mirna precursors revealed  <dig> pre-mirna sequences harboring novel mature mirnas belonging to  <dig> conserved mirna families. seventeen of the novel mirnas were validated by sequencing. using real-time quantitative rt-pcr, we found that the expression levels of  <dig> p. densata mirnas were more than 2-fold higher in needles than in stems. utilizing a web-based program psrnatarget,  <dig> mrnas were predicted to be targets of  <dig> mirna families. four mrnas were experimentally validated to be targets of  <dig> p. densata mirnas by rlm-5' race. these results suggest that regulative mirnas exist in ecologically important conifer, p. densata, and may play key roles in p. densata development, growth and response to environmental stress.
