BACKGROUND
phospholipid synthesis in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is a complex process that involves regulation by both genetic and biochemical mechanisms  <cit> . the activity levels of phospholipid synthesis enzymes are controlled by gene expression, e.g., transcription, and by other factors, i.e., lipids, water-soluble phospholipid precursors and products, and covalent modification by phosphorylation.

at the transcription level, the heterodimeric ino2/ino <dig> activator and the transcription factor opi <dig> are global regulators affecting the expression of a large number of phospholipid biosynthetic genes  <cit> . opi <dig>  containing a leucine zipper motif, has been known as a negative regulator of phospholipid biosynthesis and it can also repress the transcription of ino <dig> and ino <dig>  <cit> . in the absence of opi <dig>  the transcriptional level of both ino <dig> and ino <dig>  will be up-regulated compared to the reference strain. ino2p and ino4p binds to so-called inositol-choline response elements , and icre-bound ino2p can interact with coactivator complexes such as snf <dig> kinase that has histone kinase function, the saga complex, and the tfiib complex when opi <dig> is disrupted or not presented in the nucleus  <cit> . opi <dig> is also necessary for repression of icre-dependent transcription when inositol-choline is present in excess  <cit> . under this condition, opi <dig> is localized in the nucleus  <cit>  and prevents ino <dig> from activation of target genes by recruiting the pleiotropic co-repressors such as the cyc8/tup <dig> complex  <cit>  or sin3p  <cit> . consequently, ino <dig> variants  lead to the repression of phospholipid synthetic genes  <cit> . however, a genome wide transcription analysis of the effect of varying ino-levels that effect lipid metabolism has never been studied before.

it is known that the transcription of the phospholipid biosynthetic genes is maximally repressed in the presence of the phospholipid precursors inositol and choline   <cit> . a highly conserved 10bp-element , in at least one copy is found in the promoters of the lipid co-regulated genes such as ino <dig>  cho <dig>  cho <dig>  opi <dig>  fas <dig>  fas <dig>  acs <dig>  and acc <dig>  <cit> . this element has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient for the ic response, the so called "inositol/choline-responsive element" or "inositol-sensitive upstream activating sequence"  <cit> . these motifs are bound by a heterodimer of positive regulators ino2p and ino4p containing a basic helix-loop-helix  structural motif  <cit>  which is necessary and sufficient for dimer formation and specific interaction with the uasino motif  <cit> . recent studies have shown that expression of several genes, probably unrelated to phospholipid metabolism, is also affected by ino2p and ino4p  <cit> . importantly, over-expression of ino <dig>  counteracts ic repression, suggesting ino2p as a possible target of the signal transduction pathway triggering ic repression  <cit> 

at the biochemical mechanism level, the level of phosphatidic acid  is controlled by the biochemical regulation of key phospholipid synthesis enzymes  <cit>  and it plays a central role in the regulation of phospholipid synthesis gene expression  <cit> .

in this study, we undertook a global study of lipid metabolism in response to different ino-levels :  normal ino-level using wild-type ,  high ino-level using an opi1Δ strain, and  low  ino-level using an ino2Δ ino4Δ double deletion strain. moreover, we also focused on the deficient factors as a sub story comparing the individual knockout strains  with the double deletion strain. using a systems biology approach  <cit>  a global regulatory model for lipid metabolism could be established. with  <dig> types of nutrient limitations  and different ino-level, we were able to see the effect on expression level of the genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and the fluxes towards the different lipid components. through combined measurements of the transcriptome, metabolome, and lipidome it was possible to obtain a large dataset that could be useful to identify the effect of ino-level and also establish correlations between the different components.

all chemicals were reagent grade. phospholipids, fatty acid methyl ester and neutral lipids standards were purchased from sigma.

agar spot test on sd media with different inositol concentrations
the reference strain cen.pk 113-7d and  <dig> mutants as shown in table  <dig> were grown on sd agar plate  for  <dig> hours. the sd agar plates were supplemented with  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> or  <dig> µm of inositol.

strains, cultivation, and fermentation profile
the s. cerevisiae strains used in this study were a prototrophic strain cen.pk 113-7d   <cit>  and its derivative  supplied by peter kötter . all strains in this study were prototrophic and with mating type a . steady-state aerobic chemostat cultures were grown at  <dig> ˚c in  <dig>  l bioreactors  with working volume of  <dig>  l using a dilution rate of  <dig>   h- <dig>  for the c-limited and n-limited cultures, the medium composition was the same as in a previous study  <cit>  which contained  <dig> μm of inositol and 1mm of choline  <cit> . the ph was controlled at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  with 2m koh and dissolved oxygen was kept above 30%. chemostat cultivation ensured that metabolic and regulatory changes observed were specific to the ino-level and also the disruptions of ino <dig> and/or ino <dig>  and not complicated by external effects resulting from different specific growth rates.

samples were harvested from the cultivation media every second hour and immediately filtered through a  <dig>  μm pore-size cellulose acetate filter  and stored at - <dig> ˚c until analysis. biomass production was evaluated by measuring of optical density  and dry cell weight. glucose, glycerol, ethanol, and acetate concentrations were determined by hplc analysis using an aminex hpx-87h column   <cit> .

transcriptome analysis
transcriptome data acquisition
samples for rna extraction were taken after  <dig> h  of steady-state by rapidly taking  <dig> ml of culture and mixing with  <dig> ml of crushed ice in a  <dig> ml falcon tube to cool down the samples immediately. the cells were harvested by centrifuging at  <dig> rpm and 2˚c for  <dig> min, and then frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80˚c until subsequent rna extraction. the cells were mechanically disrupted using fastprep homogenizer  and total rna was isolated using the rneasy mini kit . the quality of total rna was assessed using an agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer  with rna  <dig> nano labchip kit . the labeled rna was synthesized using the genechip 3' ivt express kit , which was then hybridized onto the genechip yeast genome  <dig>  arrays . staining and washing of the hybridized arrays were carried out on the genechip® fluidics station  <dig>  and scanned using the genechip scanner  <dig> 7g . all transcriptome data of this study can be found at gene expression omnibus with accession number gse <dig> 

transcriptome data analysis
the transcriptome data were analyzed using bioconductor in r. raw data were normalized and processed together with probe logarithmic intensity error . pairwise t-test analysis was performed to determine the genes whose expression level is significantly changed due to ino-level, as well as the sufficiency factor. the calculated p-values were corrected for multiple testing by fdr method. a cut-off value of adjusted p value< <dig>  was set to assess statistical significance.

lipid data acquisition
total lipid extraction
the lipid extraction method was adapted from bligh and dyer <cit> . first,  <dig> mg of freeze-dried cell pellets were treated with  <dig> unit μl- <dig> of zymolyase digesting buffer  at 37°c for  <dig> min, followed by centrifugation at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min to collect the spheroplast, which was mixed with internal standards . after the addition of  <dig> ml of chloroform-methanol , the mixture was shaken horizontally at  <dig> rpm 4°c for  <dig> h, mixed with  <dig>  ml of sodium chloride solution  and centrifuged at  <dig> rpm 4°c for  <dig> min for phase separation. the lower -phase was collected and the remaining was re-extracted with  <dig> ml of chloroform-methanol . the lower -phase was collected and pooled with the previous organic fraction and kept at -20°c until further analysis.

lipid class separation, identification, and quantification using hplc-cad
lipid separation and quantification were performed using our developed method  <cit> . lipid separation was accomplished by hplc  equipped with charge aerosol detector; cad  and the gas connected was nitrogen gas with  <dig> psi gas pressure. all the separated fractions were then collected by automated fraction collector; afc- <dig> . a  <dig> μl volume of sample was injected in to the luna  <dig> µm hilic  <dig> Å  <dig> ×  <dig>  mm lc column . the flow-rate was  <dig>  ml/min and the column temperature was kept at 25˚c during all runs. the chromatogram was record at  <dig> hz frequency and gain for  <dig> pa. the polar and neutral lipid classes were separated by three solvent mixtures and gradient systems as follow:  hexane-acetic acid ;  acetone-isopropanol-acetic acid ;  water-acetone-isopropanol-acetic acid . triethylamine  was added to the solvent c to adjust ph. the samples were injected at time  <dig> and the gradient profile started at 100% of solvent a and the solvent b was gradually increased to 5% in  <dig> min and it was always kept at 5% along the process. at  <dig> min time point, solvent c was slowly entering to the system and rising up to 40% in  <dig> min. then solvent c was slowly increased until 45% in  <dig> min. finally, the gradient was reduced from 5% to 0% of solvent b and from 45% to 0% of solvent c in  <dig> min and then maintained at 100% of solvent a for  <dig> min. in total, the solvent program for the separation of all lipid classes took  <dig> min.

identification and quantification
pure lipid standards were analyzed individually using chromatography to confirm their retention times and purity. lipid standards were also co-eluted together with samples to identify peaks in unknown samples. solutions of known concentrations of different lipid classes were mixed and lipid standard curves were generated to study the linearity of the detection method and to quantify lipid classes in unknown samples. calibration curves were prepared for 5- <dig> μg ml- <dig> of pa, pe, pc, ps, pi, es, tag, fa, and es. each concentration of the standard solutions was injected twice and the average log <dig> peak area for each lipid was plotted against the absolute amount of lipid. correlation  was determined for all curves by linear regression.

fatty acid methylesters  analysis
to quantify the distribution of fatty acid long chain species, we used standard procedure developed in our laboratory which is based on the previous protocol by khoomrung et al.  <cit> . briefly,  <dig> mg of freeze-dried samples was mixed with  <dig> ml of hexane,  <dig> ml of 14% bf <dig>  and  <dig> µg of internal standard  fatty acid standard was added. the sample was then flushed into the tube's head space with nitrogen gas for 30s and closed tightly with a teflon screw cap. the tube was placed in a vessel containing  <dig> ml of milliq water and then sealed with tfm screw cap. the tube was heated using microwave digestion system  equipped with rotor pro- <dig>  the temperature programming of microwave digestion was ramped  to  <dig> ˚c within  <dig> min and maintained for  <dig> min. after cooling down sample at the room temperature,  <dig> ml of milliq water was added and shaken vigorously for  <dig> min and centrifuged at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min. the upper phase  was analysed by gc-ms.

the fames were separated and quantified using focus gc isq single quardrupole gc-ms . the separation of fames was performed on zebron  gc column  from phenomenex, macclesfield, uk. sample was injected in splitless injection mode  and helium was a carrier gas . the column temperature was initially set at  <dig> °c , then temperature was ramped to  <dig> °c  for  <dig> min, then increased to  <dig> °c  and held for  <dig> min. finally, temperature was increased to  <dig> °c  and held for  <dig>  min. mass transfer line and ion source were set at  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c, respectively. the fames were detected with electron ionization  in scan mode  and selected ion monitoring mode at m/z  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the identification of unknown fames was achieved by comparing their retention times and mass spectrum profiles with known standards . the quantification of fames was performed using quanbrowser function in xcalibur software version  <dig>  . according to the serial dilution of fame mix standards and were normalized according to the internal standard fatty acid c17: <dig>  the average molecular weights of each pl  were used for mg/gdw and mmol/gdw units conversion .

integrated analysis
the statistical adjusted p-values of each hypothesis testing were overlaid on the three networks graph of gene ontology, transcription factor-gene interaction and genome-scale metabolic model iin <dig>  <cit>  . then reporter algorithm  <cit>  was performed to obtain significant values  of go terms, transcription factors  and metabolites. the platform for integrative analysis of omics data  package for r  has been performed for integrated analysis. all the features presented in heatmaps are those features that have reporter p-value <  <dig>  and p-value <  <dig>  were considered for ino-level and deficient factors, respectively.

RESULTS
inositol is essential in the low ino-level yeast
to estimate the required inositol concentration for low ino-level , a spot test with the  <dig> yeast strains on different concentrations of inositol were performed . since the ino2-ino <dig> heterodimer regulates positively the expression of ino <dig>  and other phospholipid genes containing uasino element  <cit> , deletion of ino <dig> and ino <dig> results in a requirement for supplementation of myo-inositol. however, myo-inositol is included in our minimal medium in a concentration of  <dig> µg/l   <cit> . the spot test showed that opi1Δ as well as reference strain are prototroph for inositol but at least  <dig> µm of inositol is sufficient for low ino-level strains  to grow. however, higher concentrations of inositol  did not make much difference in term of growth. based on this we conclude that the low ino-level strains are auxotroph for inositol, and this leads us to an experimental design using  <dig> µm of inositol in the medium for all the chemostat cultures.

cell physiology and carbon metabolism
to see the effects on cell growth of each mutant strain,  <dig> strains  were grown in batch cultivations using a defined minimum medium and switched to chemostat immediately after glucose was depleted. table  <dig> summarizes the basic physiological parameters for growth on glucose for all the strains in either c-limited or n-limited conditions. during the batch, ino2Δ ino4Δ double deletion had the highest maximum specific growth rate in the c-limited medium but the lowest maximum specific growth rate in the n-limited medium . however, it was clear that the double deletion strain had longer lag phase during batch cultivation in both c-limited and n-limited conditions . interestingly, during the chemostat cultivation we found this double deletion strain had the lowest biomass yields compared to the other strains. interestingly, we found that the opi1Δ strain exhibited metabolic oscillations in the glucose limited chemostat cultures. we therefore took the samples for transcriptome analysis at two time points, at the maximum and minimum level of co <dig> production.

note: all values are average ± sd from three biological replicates.

 <dig> maximum specific growth rate on glucose during batch cultivation 

 <dig> biomass yield on glucose in chemostat cultures 

 <dig> ethanol yield on glucose in chemostat cultures 

 <dig> glycerol yield on glucose in chemostat cultures 

 <dig> acetate yield on glucose in chemostat cultures 

 <dig> succinate yield on glucose in chemostat cultures 

 <dig> co <dig> yield on glucose in chemostat cultures 

these two samples represent reductive-building  and reductive charging  of the yeast metabolic cycle respectively  <cit>  and the transcriptional data analysis for both of them were performed to see the differences from  <dig> metabolic phases . the heatmap of reporter shows that the differences between these  <dig> metabolic phases mainly affects genes associated with differences in cell cycles period. according to the respirative quotient  from table  <dig>  the phase of the population at maximum co <dig> production showed about 20% higher rq compared with all the other strains at c-limitation. based on this we therefore decided to exclude this sample and only use the sample from the minimum co <dig> production as a high ino-level representative at c-limitation condition.

double deletion of ino <dig> and ino <dig> resulted in a substantial reduction  in biomass yield compared with the reference strain . interestingly, deletion of opi <dig> resulted in a small reduction  in biomass only at n-limited but not at c-limited conditions.

ino-level in nutrient-limited conditions
the levels of ino-gene  expression in both c-limited and n-limited conditions were investigated according to the expression level from micro array results . even though there were metabolic cycle patterns with the opi1Δ strain grown at c-limited condition, the expressions of the ino genes were consistently high . this evidence shows that ino genes are up-regulated when their repressor, opi <dig>  is absent. at c-limited condition, ino levels are low in both the two single and the double deletion strains . interestingly, the ino <dig> gene seems to be expressed at a high level at n-limitation  and it possibly also tries to compensate the failure of ino <dig> expression by up-regulating its expression in the ino2Δ strain at n-limitation .

global transcriptome changes due to ino-level in nutrient-limited conditions
we used the affymetrix dna microarray platform to measure the expression level of all genes and access the global effect caused by the ino-level under nutrient-limited conditions . the transcriptome data were decomposed using principal component analysis  and student's t-test analysis . the transcriptome data are presented in venn diagrams at c-limited  and at n-limited  showing that the high ino-level  strain had more genes being significantly changed at c-limitation. on the other hand, the low ino-level  strain had more genes being significantly changed at n-limitation.

from clustering of reporter go terms ,  <dig> main clusters were identified . cluster  <dig> which is the largest group contains the genes involving the phospholipid biosynthesis, myo-inositol biosynthesis and transport, fatty acid metabolic process, cell conjugation, and ribonucleoside biosynthetic process which were highly up-regulated due to the deletion of opi <dig> , especially at n-limited condition, but down-regulated at low ino-level at both c- and n-limitation. cluster  <dig> contains genes involving maltose and sucrose catabolic process which were highly up-regulated due to the c-limitations. cluster  <dig> contains genes involving nitrogen compound metabolism, amino acid and peptide transport, and proton transport which were down-regulated in the double mutant at n-limited condition. cluster  <dig> contains genes involving amino acid biosynthesis, mitochondria biogenesis, and endoplasmic reticulum associated unfolded protein responses  which were highly significant in the double mutant strain. these genes were up-regulated at low ino-level and n-limitations but down-regulated at c-limitation.

to identify specific transcriptional regulation of metabolism in response to deletion of ino <dig> and/or ino <dig>  we performed transcriptome comparison of the three ino deficient mutants . for each strain we identified genes with significantly changed expression compared with the reference strain and then presented the results for the three strain as venn diagrams for both c-limited  and n-limited  conditions. even though it has been known that ino <dig> and ino <dig> form a heterodimeric transcription factor, we found some specific changes upon deletion of each of these genes . interestingly, ino4Δ has more significant genes due to the absent of ino <dig> compared with the two other mutants at c-limitation. at n-limitation, on the other hand, the effect is significantly higher when both ino <dig> and ino <dig> were deleted. interestingly, most of the genes involving nitrogen compounds metabolism and carbon utilization  were down-regulated due to the absence of ino <dig> and ino <dig> but up-regulated when only ino <dig> or ino <dig> were knocked out individually at n-limitation. moreover, we found that the genes involving ribosome biogenesis and rrna processing  are dramatically down-regulated when ino <dig> was knocked out especially at c-limited conditions. the evidence showed that ino <dig>  could possibly play role in ribosome biogenesis . surprisingly, most of the genes involving protein translation  were up-regulated in the double mutant at n-limited conditions while they were only up-regulated when either ino <dig> or ino <dig> were deleted at c-limitation. consistently, the genes involving phospholipid, inositol, and fatty acids  were down regulated in all three strains at both c-limited and n-limited conditions. however, they were  <dig> other clusters that also captured down-regulated genes in all three ino-deleted strains, but different for the two nutrient limitations. the first group listed in cluster  <dig>  were mainly down-regulated at n-limited condition. cluster  <dig>  on the other hand, contains genes involving er-upr and stress response, ethanol and amino acids biosynthesis that were mainly down-regulated only at c-limitation.

effects of ino-level on fatty acid biosynthesis
with uasino sites in their promoters, the expressions of fatty acid synthase genes such as acc <dig>  fas <dig>  and fas <dig> are subject to control by the ino2/ino <dig> and opi <dig> transcription factors  <cit> . at low ino-level strain, the fatty acid synthase genes  were down-regulated at both c-limited and n-limited condition . however, single deletion of each ino gene seems to have effect only at c-limitation when fas <dig>  fas <dig>  and also acc <dig> were down-regulated . in contrast, the high ino-level strains especially at n-limited condition showed an increase in fas <dig> expression and none of the fatty acid synthase genes were down-regulated. this enhanced the ability to produce more fa needed for phospholipid biosynthesis. from the reporter metabolite heatmap , the fa pools and also fatty acyl-acp were increasing for high ino-level strains especially at n-limited condition. all the low ino-level strains showed a dramatic decrease in fa and fatty acyl-acp pools as reporter metabolites. however, it seems like the effects of lacking ino genes have higher effect at c-limited than at n-limited conditions . the transcription factors involving beta-oxidation, oaf <dig> and pip <dig>  were found as reporter tf which were highly up-regulated at high ino-level but down-regulated at low ino-level . moreover, we found a significant increase in the free fatty acid  pool of all the mutants compared to the reference strain . however, the low ino-level strains showed slightly higher amount of accumulated fas due to the lower fluxes towards pls. from the plots of correlation between each fatty acid chain and their elongase enzyme coding genes , we found a correlation between c <dig> fatty acid products  and the expression value of elo <dig> to be about  <dig>  while the correlation between c <dig> fatty acids and elo2-elo <dig> transcription were found in a negative direction . presumably, c <dig> fatty acid might have a regulatory mechanism by repression their own elongase genes.

effects of ino-level on phospholipids biosynthesis and accumulation
as mentioned above the whole set of uasino-contained genes were extremely up-regulated at high ino-level . however, to get a clearer picture about the carbon channeling in lipid metabolism at the metabolite level, the fluxes in lipid biosynthesis  were calculated from the measured lipid profiles at all conditions  and this provides a clear picture of the changes in the flux distribution in response to the different factors evaluated. these fluxes were affected by many factors at several levels, such as gene transcription, protein phosphorylation, and enzyme activity. at high ino-level, the fluxes through cdp-dag and phospholipids synthesis pathway were higher than the reference about 45-55% at c-limitation and n-limitation, respectively. moreover, the expression of the genes coding for myo-inositol transporter  and choline transporter  were highly up-regulated in opi1Δ. this supported the synthesis of pi and also enhanced the kennedy pathway to produce more pc using choline and dag as precursors and it was consistent with the highly up-regulation of the genes coding for kenedy's pathway enzymes such as cpt <dig> and cki <dig> . on the other hand, the itr <dig> were constantly down-regulated in all low ino-level strains either double or single deletion in both limitation conditions. the low ino-level strain showed about 40-60% decreasing fluxes through the cdp-dag pathway which caused a dramatically decrease in the phospholipid pool especially at n-limitation. the metabolite reporter heat map showed a large increase of pl pools in the high ino-level strain. in contrast, we found a dramatically decreasing of pls in low ino-level compared to the reference strain.

focusing on the deficient effects, double deletion of ino genes  can cause more effect to the dramatically reduction of phospholipids than the effect of single deletions . about a 70% decrease in pls can be found when both ino genes were deleted, but there were only 50% or 60% decreasing in pls when ino <dig> or ino <dig> were deleted respectively. even though this double deletion effects did not make much changes in the pls pool at c-limitation, it still caused about 50% lower level of pi when compare to the single deletion strains. from the heatmap of reporter metabolites , s-adenosyl-l-methyonine or sam  was strongly decreased in all low ino-level strains and this lead to a decrease of pls  since it is required for production of pc by cho <dig> and opi <dig> 

effects of ino-level on storage lipids biosynthesis and accumulation
the production rate and accumulation of pc can cause er stress and upr activation which lead to the up-regulation of tag and es biosynthesis  <cit> . at n-limitation, the low ino-level strain  could produce and accumulate tag and se about  <dig>  folds more when compared to the high ino-level strain  and about  <dig>  folds when compare to the reference strain . presumably, the down-regulation of lpp <dig> at both c- and n-limitation for the high ino-level strain led to a decrease in tag biosynthesis and accumulation compared to the reference strain and other mutants . consistently, almost the whole set of the es genes  were down-regulated compared to the reference and this was associated with a dramatically decreasing levels of es and se. this correlation between transcription of es genes and es level was also supported by the up-regulation of several es genes in all low ino-level strains especially at n-limited condition . interestingly, the double deletion strain showed a greater effect in increasing tag only at n-limitation. this evidence was supported by the up-regulation of the are <dig> gene in the double deletion strain  which codes for the enzyme for the first step of se biosynthesis. at c-limited condition, on the other hand, ino2Δ ino4Δ has a larger effect on decreasing the tag level compared with the single deletion strains. moreover, the fluxes through es of the ino2Δ strain was about 80% lower when compare to ino <dig> deletion and double deletion at c-limited condition.

ino <dig> might have an extra function, beside the regulator of phospholipid biosynthesis, response to nitrogen starvation and amino acids starvations
it is possible that ino <dig>  but not ino <dig>  plays a role as a regulator for amino acid metabolism. it may not be ino <dig> alone since ino <dig>  unlike ino <dig>  does not have a trans-activating domain  which is recognized for the rna polymerase ii complex  <cit> . in ino4Δ, the genes involving ribosome biogenesis and assembly were extremely down regulated especially at c-limited conditions and this was exactly the responsive process for amino acids  starvation. there are indications that the induction of ino4-regulated lipid biosynthesis genes may be connected to the immediate need of membrane material used for the autophagocytosis process  <cit> . this process is utilized by yeast in order to regulate the equilibrium between proteins and the diminishing set of amino acids due to starvation conditions  <cit> . from the reporter metabolite heatmap , most of the amino acids were found to be greatly down-regulated  in all low ino-level strains which pointed an amino acid starvation response.

to identify the extra function of ino <dig> on protein biosynthesis, we also performed the pearson correlation analysis of ino <dig> to all other genes based on the normalized expression values from transcriptome data of all strains and all conditions. using the cut off at  <dig>  absolute correlation value, about  <dig> genes were selected as the high correlated genes of ino <dig> . the overrepresentation of gene ontology categories  were identified and analyzed using bingo, a cytoscape plugin  <cit> . from the ino <dig> positively correlated genes listed in table s <dig> in additional file  <dig> it confirmed the main function of ino <dig>  as a positive regulators of lipid biosynthesis and inositol-choline transport involved genes as it has been reported before by many researchers. however, the list of ino <dig> negatively correlated genes in table s <dig>  showed the new findings that ino <dig> is actually play an extra role as the negative regulator of the translation process, protein biosynthesis and assembly, and also involves in mitochondrial translation. ino <dig>  on the other hand, had about  <dig> negatively correlated genes that passed through the cut off at  <dig>  absolute pearson correlation value. this particular group contains many interesting genes involving protein transport, protein catabolic process, and proteolysis which might also responds for amino acid starvation as summarized in table s <dig> .

linkage among sulfur-phospholipids, protein synthesis, and er-upr pathway
the double deletion of ino <dig> and ino <dig> at n-limitation showed some effects from amino acid starvation. upr genes were also down-regulated when the synthesis level of amino acids was decreasing . it also has been known that decreasing pc levels leads to the accumulation of saturated pc molecular species in the er membrane which causes er stress, upr activation and these evidences lead to the up-regulation of fa, tag, and sterol biosynthesis in the end  <cit> . therefore, in the low ino-level strain, the kar <dig> gene which is a responsive gene for er-upr was up-regulated especially at n-limitation. the high ino-level on the other hand, showed a large decrease in expression of kar <dig> especially at c-limited condition. these evidences show that there is a linkage which plays a role in regulating the homeostasis among amino acids biosynthesis, phospholipids biosynthesis, and the er-upr pathway. as it has been reported before most of the genes coding for enzymes involved in cysteine-methionine biosynthesis, i.e. met <dig>  met <dig>  met <dig>  met <dig>  sah <dig>  sah <dig>  contain icre or uasino sequences in their upstream regions  <cit> , and these genes were up-regulated at high ino-level while opi <dig>  was disturbed. consequently, we found down-regulation of met <dig> and sah <dig> and especially sah <dig> in all low ino-level mutants, especially at c-limited condition. this leads to reduced synthesis and accumulation of storage lipids at c-limited condition compared to their references . this pointed out that amino acid synthesis genes might be controlled by the regulation of snf <dig> kinase  which is always activated at low glucose  condition and consistent with our previous study  <cit> . consistently, met <dig> and sah <dig> were up-regulated at high ino-level at n-limitations where snf <dig> is consistently repressed by excess glucose in the culture media, and this leads to the slightly higher biosynthesis of tag and hence tag accumulation . based on our findings and some supporting knowledge from the previous study  <cit> , the overall regulation systems linking amino acids-protein synthesis, lipid metabolism and er-upr is summarised in figure  <dig> which has kinase proteins and several transcription factors involved.

CONCLUSIONS
through integrated analysis of transcriptome and lipidome derived from robust experimental setup, it was possible to obtain a large-scale dataset that could be used to systematically identify correlations and associations between the different components. we were able to see the effect on expression of the genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and metabolic fluxes through lipid biosynthesis pathway. we found that there is an effect of ino <dig>  but not by ino <dig>  on the ribosome biogenesis and assembly which involves an amino acid starvation response. it points to an interesting link between lipid metabolism and the amino acid starvation response and we also found an effect of phospholipids on er-upr activation. moreover, we found a close linkage among ino genes, amino acid genes, and probably snf <dig> kinase in controlling lipid biosynthesis and accumulation. following our analysis by genome-wide strategy and analysis of generated complex data by integrated analysis approach enable us to explore correlations and association of changes in a concerted fashion.
