BACKGROUND
the human genome encodes sixty-nine gdp/gtp exchange factors  for small gtpases of the rho subfamily  <cit> . all share the ability to remove gdp from target rho proteins, allowing gtp to bind so that downstream effectors can be activated. in addition to having two rhogef domains, the kalirin/trio subfamily is unique in its use of multiple protein/protein and protein/lipid interaction modules . kalirin <dig>  the most prevalent isoform in adult brain, begins with a sec14p domain, includes multiple spectrin-like repeats and ends with a pdz binding motif. kalirin <dig> is concentrated at the post-synaptic density  and is necessary for spine maturation, maintenance and function  <cit> . kalirin <dig>  the largest isoform, is most prevalent during embryonic development, but is also present in adult neurons  <cit> .

features unique to kalirin <dig> include tandem ig and fn domains as well as a putative kinase domain . while the drosophila trio gene encodes neither an ig nor a fn domain, c. elegans unc <dig>  the paralog of kalirin and trio, encodes tandem igfn domains and mammalian trio genes encode a single ig domain  <cit> . both extracellular and intracellular igfn domains are involved in protein-protein interactions  <cit> . to gain insight into roles unique to kalirin <dig>  we searched for proteins that interacted with its igfn domain, and identified the gtpase domain of dynamin.

dynamin, a gtpase that causes membrane tubulation and fission, plays an essential role in both exocytosis and endocytosis  <cit> . self-assembly increases the gtpase activity of dynamin  <cit> , as does the binding of dynamin to pip2-containing lipid tubules  <cit> . dynamin interacts with several sh <dig> domain proteins through its c-terminal proline-rich domain  and with itself via the interaction of its gtpase domain with its assembly or gtpase effector  domain  <cit>  . in developing neurons, both exocytosis and endocytosis are critical players in the deployment and retraction of membrane, and must be coordinated with the assembly and disassembly of filamentous actin and microtubules in order to promote directed neuronal growth  <cit> . in mature neurons, dendritic spines must coordinate exocytosis and endocytosis to respond rapidly to incoming stimuli with changes in shape and altered deployment of receptors  <cit> .

rho gefs of the trio/kalirin family, with their ability to activate rac and rhog, participate in the membrane remodeling associated with growth cone extension and active dendritic spines  <cit> . unc- <dig> regulates the subcellular localization of unc- <dig>  a deleted in colorectal cancer  receptor homolog, to direct growth cone migration  <cit> . trio <dig>  a splice variant which lacks the c-terminal gef <dig>  ig and kinase domains  <cit> , modulates endosome dynamics and neurite elongation in purkinje neurons  <cit> . in att- <dig> cells, both kalirin and trio affect secretion via the regulated pathway  <cit> . expression of exogenous kalirin <dig> in non-neuronal cells inhibits the uptake of transferrin  <cit> . this response requires the presence of the sec14p domain, which binds phosphatidylinositol--bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol--phosphate, and the spectrin-like repeats, which allow kalirin to oligomerize.

methods
expression vectors
fragments of rat kalirin were cloned into the peak <dig> vector  with a his6-myc epitope tag at the nh2-terminus  <cit> . enhanced green fluorescent protein  replaced residues l1127sthts <dig> of kalirin <dig> in the peak gfp-kalirin <dig> vector  <cit> . the igfn region of kalirin  was inserted into the pegfp-n <dig> vector to make a gfp-igfn fusion protein, and into pgex-6p  to generate gst-igfn. pegfp-n <dig> vectors encoding gfp fused to the c-terminus of human dynamin <dig>  dynamin2/k44a, dynamin2/Δprd , and dynamin <dig> ged/prd  were the kind gifts of dr. pietro de camilli   <cit> . a vector encoding gfp fused to the c-terminus of the gtpase domain of human dynamin <dig>  was generated by subcloning a pcr amplified fragment flanked by hindiii and ecor  <dig> sites into pegfp-n <dig>  all constructs were verified by dna sequencing.

gst fusion protein expression and purification
bacteria  were transformed with vectors encoding pgex.gst-igfn or gst-amphiphysin <dig> sh <dig> , grown to stationary phase in lb medium containing ampicillin, diluted 100-fold and grown to od <dig> =  <dig>  at 37c, induced with  <dig>  mm iptg and grown at 16c overnight. pellets of cells were resuspended in pbs  and passed  <dig> times through a french press. supernatants from a  <dig> ml culture were tumbled with  <dig>  ml glutathione-sepharose at 4c for  <dig> h. beads were washed twice with  <dig> vol pbs, and once with  <dig> vol pbs containing  <dig> % triton x- <dig>  fusion proteins remained on the beads . to elute the fusion proteins from the beads, beads were equilibrated with  <dig> vol of  <dig> mm tris·hcl, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> mm dtt and eluted with  <dig>  ml  <dig> mm tris·hcl, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> mm dtt,  <dig> mm reduced glutathione. fractions were dialyzed into  <dig> mm hepes, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> mm dtt, 50% glycerol at 4c.

gst-igfn binding assay
freshly dissected female adult rat cortex was minced and homogenized in  <dig>  m sucrose,  <dig> mm tris·hcl, ph  <dig>   using a potter-elvehjem homogenizer and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at  <dig> × g for  <dig> min. the supernatant was centrifuged at  <dig>  × g,  <dig> min; the resulting supernatant constituted the cytosolic fraction. the high speed pellet was resuspended in  <dig> mm na tes,  <dig> mm mannitol, 1% tx- <dig>  ph  <dig>   with protease inhibitors for  <dig> min, then centrifuged at  <dig>  × g,  <dig> min. the detergent supernatant is the solubilized organellar fraction; the insoluble pellet was discarded. samples were pre-cleared by incubation with gst-glutathione-sepharose 4b beads for  <dig> h, 4c and supernatants were incubated with gst-igfn-glutathione-sepharose 4b beads for  <dig> h, 4c and washed. bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 1× sds loading buffer; aliquots were fractionated on 4–20% polyacrylamide gels. proteins transferred to pvdf membranes were visualized with coomassie brilliant blue r <dig> or aurodye forte . for mass spectroscopy, bands were excised from coomassie stained gels and prepared for trypsin digestion at the uchc proteomics & biological mass spectrometry facility   <cit> . five peptide sequences from rat dynamin <dig> were identified. verification of mass spectroscopy results utilized antibodies that cross-react with all three dynamin gene products  , or recognize individually dynamin <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> .

peak rapid cells were transiently transfected with vectors encoding egfp or various fragments of dynamin. after  <dig> h, cells were extracted into  <dig>  ml  <dig> mm nates,  <dig> mm mannitol, ph  <dig>   containing protease inhibitor cocktail  <cit>  and  <dig>  mm na4vo <dig>  following centrifugation , lysates were tumbled with gst or gst-igfn beads, 4c,  <dig> h. after three rinses with tmt, proteins eluted by boiling in sds sample buffer were separated by sds-page.

immunoprecipitation
rat cortical cytosolic fractions  and extracts of transfected peak rapid cells were used for immunoprecipitations. peak rapid cells extracted in tm were centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> h to remove particulates. samples  were incubated with antibodies to kalirin   <cit> , gfp , or dynamin  for  <dig> h at 4c; immune complexes were isolated with protein g or a sepharose . samples were fractionated on 4–20% polyacrylamide sds gels and western blot analysis was carried out with antibodies to kalirin <dig>  dynamin or gfp .

primary cortical cultures and nucleofection
cortices from e <dig>  to p <dig> rats were diced and dissociated using a papain dissociation system . plasmids  were introduced into dissociated cells  by nucleofection using the rat neuron nucleofector kit, program o- <dig> . nucleofected and control neurons  were plated onto poly-l-lysine coated glass coverslips and incubated in neurobasal medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for  <dig> to  <dig> h; the medium was then changed to neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% b <dig>  2% fetal calf serum,  <dig>  mm l-glutamine,  <dig> μm l-glutamic acid,  <dig> u/ml penicillin and  <dig>  mg/ml streptomycin . after  <dig> days in vitro, 50% of the medium was replaced with fresh medium.

immunocytochemistry
after  <dig> h in vitro, cortical neuron cultures were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in pbs, permeabilized and blocked  <cit> . primary antibodies were applied for  <dig> h and secondary antibodies for  <dig> h at room temperature; coverslips were mounted using prolong gold antifade reagent . images were captured using a zeiss lsm510-meta confocal microscope. kalirin <dig> was detected using affinity-purified rabbit antibody jh <dig>   <cit> ; cy3-labeled donkey anti-rabbit igg  was used for co-staining with fitc-phalloidin  while alexa488-labeled donkey anti-rabbit igg  was used for co-staining with pan-dynamin monoclonal antibody  using cy3-labeled donkey anti-mouse igg . specificity of the kalirin <dig> antibody was verified by pre-incubation  with antigenic peptide  at 4c for  <dig> min; no signal was seen when the blocked antibody was applied to cortical neurons . βiii tubulin was detected with a chicken monoclonal antibody  followed by alexa633-labeled goat anti-chicken igg.

endocytosis of transferrin
after  <dig> days in vitro, cortical neurons nucleofected with vector encoding kalirin <dig> or egfp were rinsed with serum-free dmem for  <dig> min and incubated with  <dig> μg/ml alexafluor546-transferrin  in serum-free dmem for  <dig> min at 37c. cells were quickly rinsed with serum-free dmem and fixed with 4% formaldehyde  in pbs. uptake of transferrin by pc <dig> cells was assessed in a similar manner. removal of surface bound transferrin with a low ph wash  did not change the answer. kalirin <dig> positive neurons were identified using myc monoclonal antibody and fitc-tagged donkey anti-mouse igg; neurons were identified by simultaneously visualizing βiii tubulin using chicken antibody  and alexa633-goat-anti-chicken igg . to quantify alexafluor546- transferrin uptake, images from egfp or kalirin <dig> positive neurons were acquired under identical conditions using a zeiss lsm <dig> meta confocal microscope. once background fluorescence was defined, the cell soma was identified automatically using the  <dig> nm signal  and simplepci software ; total and mean red within the cell soma were measured for each transfected neuron. significance was calculated using a two-tailed student's t-test.

dynamin self-assembly assay
adult rat brains  were homogenized in  <dig> ml of buffer a . triton x- <dig> was added  and the sample clarified by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> min. rat brain supernatant  was incubated with  <dig>  ml gst-amphiphysin-2/sh <dig> domain  <cit>   bound to glutathione sepharose 4b equilibrated with buffer a. after tumbling for  <dig> h at 4c, beads were washed  <dig> times with  <dig> bed volumes buffer a. proteins were eluted twice with  <dig> ml buffer b . pooled eluates were dialyzed into buffer c . based on sds-page, the pooled eluate  contained  <dig>  mg/ml dynamin. liposomes were prepared with 10% phosphatidylinositol- <dig> -bisphosphate  and 90% brain polar extract   <cit> . organic solvent was removed using dry argon and a vacuum pump. the lipid film was re-hydrated with buffer g  by vortexing continuously for  <dig> min. after three freeze/thaw cycles and repeated extrusion  through a  <dig> μm filter , the liposome suspension was centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> min; the supernatant, which contains liposomes ≤  <dig> μm in diameter was used. the dynamin assembly assay was performed using purified dynamin pre-incubated or not with gst or gst-igfn on ice for  <dig> h and incubated at room temperature for  <dig> min with or without fresh liposomes. oligomerized dynamin was pelleted by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> min. supernatant and pellet fractions were recovered and equal aliquots were subjected to sds-page; dynamin in each fraction was determined by staining proteins transferred to pvdf membranes with coomassie brilliant blue.

RESULTS
the igfn domain of kalirin <dig> interacts with dynamin
alternative splicing at the 3'-end of the kalirin gene generates transcripts encoding kalirin <dig> and  <dig> plus additional isoforms not diagramed   <cit> . each longer kalirin isoform contains additional domains and a unique c-terminus. the domains unique to the largest characterized isoform, kalirin <dig>  presumably contribute to its functions in the cell. to explore this possibility, a gst-igfn fusion protein was purified, bound to glutathione sepharose 4b, and incubated with cytosolic and solubilized organellar fractions prepared from adult rat cortex. proteins that bound to gst-igfn, but not to gst, and were not in the control fraction were of interest . a  <dig> kda protein was the most prevalent band meeting these criteria and was subjected to trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry. five dynamin peptides were identified, suggesting that dynamin might interact with kalirin <dig> . dynamins <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> share the domain structure illustrated in fig. 1c; three of the peptides identified were unique to dynamin <dig>  one was also present in dynamins <dig> and  <dig>  and the fifth was common to dynamins <dig> and  <dig>  but not dynamin <dig> 

to determine which dynamins could be identified amongst the proteins bound to the igfn domain of kalirin <dig>  binding was evaluated utilizing antibodies directed towards dynamins <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  each of which is expressed in the adult cortex . both dynamin <dig> and dynamin <dig> were detected, although detection of dynamin <dig> required loading more of the bound fraction onto the gel. an interaction between the igfn domain of kalirin <dig> and dynamin <dig> was not detectable. as in the adult brain, all three isoforms of dynamin are expressed in embryonic day  <dig> brain and in post-natal day  <dig> cortex ; all three isoforms of dynamin are also expressed in rat pc <dig> pheochromocytoma cells, one of the cell lines utilized for these studies. kalirin <dig> expression declined with age, but was readily detected in adult rat cortex; pc <dig> cells were previously shown to express kalirin <dig>  <cit> . although it was apparent that only a small percentage of the total dynamin interacted with the igfn domain of kalirin <dig> and these experiments do not establish a direct interaction, the interaction is specific.

kalirin <dig> interacts with dynamin in vivo
since dynamin <dig> and  <dig> interacted with the isolated igfn domain of kalirin in a gst pull-down assay, we next evaluated their ability to interact with full-length kalirin <dig> in intact cells. peak rapid cells, a human embryonic kidney line, were transiently transfected with vectors encoding full-length myc-tagged kalirin <dig>  based on western blot analysis, these cells express dynamin <dig>  but not dynamin <dig> , as expected for fibroblasts  <cit> . cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with kalirin antibody and analyzed with a pan-dynamin antibody . as observed in the gst pull-down assay, a small percentage of the endogenous dynamin was co-immunoprecipitated with kalirin  <dig> .

we next wanted to determine whether endogenous kalirin <dig> and dynamin interacted. since kalirin <dig> was enriched in embryonic brain, cytosolic fractions from rat embryonic cortex were analyzed. immunoprecipitation with a kalirin spectrin antibody and analysis with a pan-dynamin antibody demonstrated co-immunoprecipitation of dynamin . antisera specific for dynamin <dig> and dynamin <dig> were used to demonstrate co-immunoprecipitation of both dynamins with kalirin . the kalirin spectrin antibody immunoprecipitates all of the major isoforms of kalirin; to confirm the interaction of dynamin with kalirin <dig>  samples were immunoprecipitated with a pan-dynamin antibody and detected with a kalirin <dig> specific antibody . co-immunoprecipitation of dynamin and kalirin <dig> was demonstrated.

we next compared the localization of kalirin <dig> and dynamin in cortical neurons . when examined  <dig> h after plating, kalirin <dig> positive puncta were prevalent in the soma  and growth cones  of all cortical neurons. pan-dynamin positive puncta were also apparent in the soma and in growth cones . both proteins were present at multiple sites in these young neurons. co-localization of a small fraction of the kalirin <dig> and dynamin was observed in the cell soma and in growth cones . this result was consistent with the small fraction of the total dynamin or total kalirin recovered by co-immunoprecipitation.

the igfn domain of kalirin binds to the gtpase domain of dynamin in a gtp-dependent manner
the gtpase activity of dynamin is critical to its function  <cit> . under physiological conditions, dynamins are loaded with gtp  <cit> . the ability of dynamin to bind gtp and function as a gtpase can be blocked by mutating the key lys residue in the gtpase domain  to ala  <cit> . to determine whether the ability of kalirin <dig> to bind to dynamin was sensitive to its gtp-binding state, lysates containing dynamin2-gfp or dynamin2/k44a-gfp  were incubated with beads containing gst or gst-igfn . dynamin <dig> was used for these studies because a collection of gfp-tagged variants were available  <cit> . while binding of dynamin <dig> was readily detected, dynamin2/k44a failed to bind to kalirin igfn . the presence of equivalent amounts of gst-igfn and gst was verified by coomassie staining .

to determine whether the gtpase domain of dynamin bound to the igfn domain of kalirin, lysates containing dynamin2/gtpase domain were incubated with beads loaded with gst or gst-igfn; binding of the isolated gtpase domain to the igfn beads was readily detected . to explore further the effect of gtp on the interaction of dynamin with kalirin-igfn, gtp or gtpγs was added to lysates containing dynamin2/gfp before the gst-igfn beads were added; both gtp and its non-hydrolyzable analog enhanced the interaction . in these crude lysates, addition of gtp could increase dynamin binding directly or indirectly, by affecting its oligomerization  <cit> . consistent with the ability of dynamins <dig> and  <dig> to interact with kalirin-igfn, their gtpase domains are almost 90% identical .

the ability of other fragments of dynamin to bind to gst-igfn was evaluated to determine whether additional interactions could be detected. the proline rich domain  at the c-terminus of dynamin  interacts with a number of proteins that contain src-homology- <dig>  domains  <cit> . we expressed a fragment of dynamin <dig> containing only the ged and prd and a truncated version of dynamin <dig> that lacked the prd; both proteins were expressed well . while the ged/prd fragment failed to bind to the igfn domain of kalirin, dynamin lacking its prd  continued to bind. attempts to express the middle/ph/ged or middle domain fused to gfp led to insoluble aggregates.

we next wanted to determine whether isoforms of kalirin that lacked the igfn domain interacted with the gtpase domain of dynamin. the dynamin2/gtpase-gfp fusion protein and kalirin <dig> or kalirin <dig> were co-expressed in peak rapid cells . the gtpase domain of dynamin <dig> interacted with kalirin <dig>  but not with kalirin <dig>  taken together, our data indicate that the gtpase domain of dynamin binds to the igfn domain of kalirin in a gtp-dependent manner.

the igfn domain of kalirin disrupts dynamin self-assembly
the gtpase activity of dynamin is increased dramatically following its oligomerization  <cit> . phosphatidylinositol- <dig> -bisphosphate-containing liposomes induce the oligomerization of purified rat brain dynamin, which can be assessed by quantifying the recovery of oligomerized dynamin from the liposome-containing particulate fraction  <cit> . the dynamin used for these studies was purified from adult rat brain using the sh <dig> domain of amphiphysin <dig>  which binds dynamin through its prd ; since adult rat brain was used, most of the dynamin in this preparation is dynamin <dig>  <cit> . in the presence of pip2-containing liposomes, coomassie staining revealed the recovery of 97% of the dynamin from the particulate fraction; in the absence of liposomes, only 3% of the dynamin was recovered from the pellet . when purified, recombinant gst-igfn domain was added to the mixture of pip2-containing liposomes and purified dynamin, most of the dynamin remained in the supernatant. the addition of gst did not have an inhibitory effect on dynamin oligomerization. to determine whether the igfn domain of kalirin bound to liposomes, thus indirectly blocking the binding of dynamin, igfn domain was incubated with liposomes in the absence of dynamin. coomassie blue staining revealed the presence of the igfn domain in the supernatant fraction in the presence and absence of liposomes , indicating no direct interaction of the igfn domain with liposomes.

data from several experiments were quantified following normalization to the amount of dynamin pelleted in the presence of liposomes . the ability of liposomes to induce the oligomerization of purified dynamin was blocked by the addition of recombinant gst-igfn domain . in these studies, the molar ratio of gst-igfn:dynamin was approximately 5: <dig>  kalirin binds in a gtp-dependent manner to the gtpase domain of dynamin, blocking the ability of dynamin to oligomerize, and presumably to activate, upon interacting with phospholipids  <cit> . these data suggest an inhibitory role for kalirin <dig> in regulating dynamin-mediated trafficking.

overexpression of kalirin <dig> or igfn disrupts endocytosis of transferrin in pc <dig> cells
dynamin oligomers constrict, severing the necks of nascent vesicles in a gtp-hydrolysis-dependent reaction  <cit> . this fission step is critical to the endocytic trafficking of many membrane proteins  <cit> . the uptake of fluorescently tagged transferrin provides an assessment of dynamin-mediated endocytosis  <cit> . to explore the possibility that kalirin <dig> plays a role in controlling dynamin-mediated endocytosis, kalirin12-gfp, its gfp-tagged igfn domain or gfp were expressed in rat pc <dig> pheochromocytoma cells, which express both dynamin <dig> and dynamin <dig> . following a  <dig> min incubation with fluorescently-tagged transferrin, cells were rinsed and fixed . transferrin uptake by cells expressing gfp-igfn  was inhibited to varying extents compared to cells expressing gfp ; even when endocytosed by gfp-igfn expressing cells, transferrin failed to accumulate in the perinuclear region, remaining distributed throughout the cell. pc <dig> cells expressing kalirin12-gfp  were unable to endocytose significant amounts of transferrin . despite its lower levels of expression, kalirin12-gfp had a more profound inhibitory effect on transferrin uptake than the isolated igfn domain. uptake of transferrin was categorized as normal, with readily detected puncta of fluorescently-tagged transferrin accumulated in the interior of the cell, or reduced . while 90% of non-transfected or gfp-transfected cells were categorized as normal, endocytosis was categorized as reduced in 60% of the cells expressing gfp-igfn . uptake was scored as reduced in over 80% of the cells expressing kalirin12-gfp.

overexpression of kalirin <dig> disrupts endocytosis of transferrin in primary neurons
we next explored the effects of exogenous kalirin <dig> and igfn on transferrin uptake by primary cultures of rat cortical neurons. after  <dig> days in vitro, cultures were incubated with alexafluor546-transferrin for  <dig> min, rinsed and fixed . cells expressing egfp or myc-kalirin <dig> were located and identified as neurons based on staining for βiii tubulin. internalized transferrin was quantified in at least  <dig> images by measuring total red intensity in the cell soma. over-expression of kalirin <dig> reduced total red intensity in the cell soma by approximately 50%; soma area was unaffected . in a separate series of experiments using postnatal day  <dig> striatal neurons, expression of gfp-igfn or kalirin12-gfp was found to inhibit transferrin uptake . although our co-immunoprecipitation data indicate that only a small percentage of the endogenous kalirin <dig> and dynamin is stably interacting at any given time, our functional data demonstrate that over-expressed, exogenous kalirin <dig> has a powerful inhibitory effect on dynamin-mediated endocytosis.

discussion
igfn domains distinguish isoforms of kalirin/trio
the igfn domain of kalirin binds to the gtpase domain of dynamin, inhibiting dynamin self-assembly. although the dtrio gene does not encode igfn domains, the c. elegans unc- <dig> gene generates isoforms that include tandem igfn domains  <cit> . mammalian trio has a single ig domain that binds rhoa, increasing its gef activity  <cit> ; rhoa does not bind to the igfn domain of kalirin . the igfn regions of mammalian kalirin and trio are more divergent than any other domain  <cit> . in addition to kalirin <dig>  only duet, which lacks the spectrin-repeats and first gef domain of kalirin <dig>  contains the tandem igfn domains  <cit> .

igfn domains, with their  <dig> anti-parallel β-sheets, often serve as protein-protein interaction sites and are more common in extracellular than intracellular proteins  <cit> . intracellular proteins with igfn domains include titin, with  <dig> ig domains, and short smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase, with three ig domains and one fn domain  <cit> . when mechanically stretched, the ig and fn domains of titin vary in the force required for unwinding, with fn domains generally disrupted more easily than ig domains. with kalirin <dig> linked to plasma membrane phosphoinositides through its sec14p domain  <cit>  and to dynamin, it is conceivable that force-mediated unwinding of the igfn domain could occur.

kalirin <dig> interacts with dynamin
dynamin is crucial for membrane fusion and fission during exocytosis and endocytosis  <cit> . our data indicate that the igfn domain of kalirin binds dynamin in vitro and in vivo , and in a gtp-dependent manner . mutation of lys <dig>  a key residue in the gtp binding site of dynamin <dig>  <cit> , reduced the binding of dynamin <dig> to kalirin-igfn. in the presence of gtp or gtpγs, the binding of dynamin <dig> to kalirin-igfn was increased. while kalirin <dig> and kalirin-igfn bound to the  <dig> kda gtpase domain of dynamin <dig>  kalirin <dig>  which lacks the igfn domain, did not .

both dynamin and kalirin are multiply phosphorylated and their interaction may be regulated by phosphorylation state  <cit> . constitutive phosphorylation of dynamin is catalyzed by protein kinase c and cdk5; along with synaptojanin, amphiphysin, and epsin, dynamin must be dephosphorylated before it can assemble and promote vesicle scission  <cit> . kalirin is also phosphorylated by cdk <dig> and rapidly dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase  <dig> under basal conditions  <cit> . dynamin interacts with a variety of proteins through its c-terminal proline-rich domain, targeting it to specific sites of action  <cit> . whether the two sh <dig> domains of kalirin bind to the proline-rich domain of dynamin has not yet been investigated.

the kalirin-igfn domain blocks dynamin self-assembly and inhibits dynamin-mediated endocytosis
dynamin, through its gtpase activity, functions as a mechanoenzyme, facilitating membrane fission  <cit> . self-assembly is an essential step in activating the gtpase activity of dynamin  <cit> . using an in vitro assay  <cit>  we demonstrated that the igfn domain of kalirin blocked liposome triggered dynamin self-assembly . other proteins known to interact with the gtpase domain of dynamin in a gtp-dependent manner include the phox homology domain of phospholipase d, which acts as a gtpase activating protein  for dynamin  <cit> . the sh <dig> domain of phospholipase c-γ <dig> binds to the proline rich domain of dynamin <dig> and functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor  for dynamin <dig>  <cit> . the fact that exogenous kalirin <dig> inhibited uptake of transferrin , a dynamin-mediated process, suggests that a similar interaction may be used normally in neurons. tethered to the membrane via its sec14p, ph or spectrin-like repeats and to dynamin via its igfn domain, kalirin <dig> could link activation of dynamin to membrane deformation and cytoskeletal reorganization.

a role for kalirin in endocytosis
exocytosis and endocytosis, which are prevalent at growth cones  <cit> , must occur in a carefully balanced and spatially controlled manner in response to multiple attractive and repulsive signals. similarly, the insertion and retrieval of the receptors prevalent in dendritic spines requires carefully controlled, signal mediated exocytosis and endocytosis  <cit> . kalirin <dig> is well equipped to play a key role in both processes. kalirin <dig>  like its drosophila paralog, dtrio, is localized to vesicular structures and membranes in neuronal processes and growth cones  <cit> . in addition to a general role in endocytosis, the c. elegans paralog, unc- <dig>  may affect growth cone guidance by regulating the localization of unc- <dig>  a growth cone guidance cue receptor  <cit> . in the adult brain, expression of kalirin <dig>  which does not interact with the gtpase domain of dynamin, greatly exceeds expression of kalirin <dig>  but both proteins can be identified at the psd  <cit> . the n-terminal region of kalirin <dig>  which is shared by kalirin <dig>  localizes to the sub-plasma membrane region of non-neuronal cells, where it inhibits the uptake of transferrin  <cit> . both the phosphoinositide-binding sec14p-domain of kalirins <dig> and  <dig> and their spectrin-like repeat regions, which have been shown to interact with arf6-gdp  <cit> , could contribute to additional interactions affecting endocytic trafficking in dendritic spines and axonal terminals.

CONCLUSIONS
the igfn domain unique to kalirin <dig> interacts with the gtpase domain of dynamin in a gtp-dependent manner and inhibits dynamin oligomerization. transient interactions between dynamin and kalirin <dig>  with its n-terminal phosphatidylinositide binding sec14p domain, multiple spectrin-like repeats and rhogef domains, may facilitate the coordination of endocytic trafficking and changes in the actin cytoskeleton.
