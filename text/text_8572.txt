BACKGROUND
salmonella diversified from a common ancestor with e. coli approx.  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . this diversification was associated with the acquisition of genes which increased the virulence of salmonella and enabled it to interact with its hosts and colonise the intestinal tract of animals in a different way than e. coli did. the genomic sequences of e. coli and s. enterica serovars typhi and typhimurium have been known since  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively  <cit>  and genes which are absent in e. coli and are necessary for the full virulence expression of salmonella are therefore relatively well described. most of them are clustered at specific parts of the salmonella chromosome called pathogenicity islands. there are  <dig> major pathogenicity islands in the salmonella enterica chromosome but only  <dig> of them, with spi- <dig> absent, in the chromosome of salmonella bongori, a second species belonging to the genus salmonella  <cit> .

the major pathogenicity islands include spi- <dig>  spi- <dig>  spi- <dig>  spi- <dig> and spi- <dig>  the spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> genes code for proteins forming the type iii secretion system  which enable the transport of s. enterica proteins from the bacterial cell directly into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. the spi- <dig> encoded t3ss is required for the transport of s. enterica proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane of a host cell into its cytosol where they induce cytoskeletal rearrangements resulting in the uptake of s. enterica even by non-phagocytic cells  <cit> . in addition, it has been reported that spi- <dig> genes, independent of cell invasion, induce macrophage cytotoxicity  <cit> . interestingly, neither of these functions is required for the s. typhimurium virulence for balb/c mice since a mutant without the whole spi- <dig> was as virulent as the control wild type strain  <cit> . spi- <dig> encoded t3ss is required for the transport of s. enterica proteins across the phagosomal membrane and increases s. enterica survival inside phagocytic cells  <cit> . the function of genes localised on the remaining spis is less well characterised; spi- <dig> genes are involved both in gut colonisation due to misl-dependent fibronectin binding and intracellular survival due to high-affinity magnesium transport encoded by mgtabc  <cit> . spi- <dig> genes are required for the intestinal phase of disease by coding for non-fimbrial adhesin  <cit> , and the genes localised in spi- <dig> are co-regulated with either spi- <dig> or spi- <dig> genes and therefore code for effector proteins transported by either of these t3ss  <cit> . however, the vast majority of this information has been obtained in a mouse model and s. typhimurium and much less data are available for s. enteritidis and pigs, cattle or poultry although these animal species, and poultry in particular, represent major reservoirs of salmonella for the human population in europe.

the roles of different spi genes in the virulence s. enterica for chickens are less well understood. similarly to mice, the importance of spi- <dig> for salmonella persistence in the internal organs has been described in chickens  <cit> . however, unlike the situation in mice, it seems that in chickens, spi- <dig> genes are required for both the colonisation of the intestinal tract and the ability to reach and persist in internal organs such as the liver and spleen  <cit> . the importance of the other spis for salmonella virulence in chickens is even less clear. to our knowledge, spi- <dig> mutants have not been tested in chickens at all, spi- <dig> mutants have been tested and shown to have no effect on chicken gut colonisation  <cit>  and spi- <dig> genes, although involved in the induction of the proinflammatory immune response in cattle, have been described as having no significant function in chickens  <cit> .

in this study we therefore compared virulence of isogenic mutants of s. enterica subsp. enterica serovar enteritidis  defective in  <dig> major pathogenicity islands for day-old chickens. to do this we deleted spi- <dig> to spi- <dig> from the s. enteritidis chromosome and orally infected chickens with these mutants. our data indicate that the colonisation of the liver and spleen by s. enteritidis in chickens is dependent on spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> and that the remaining spis individually have no effect on s. enteritidis virulence although collectively they had a low effect on spleen colonisation.

RESULTS
infection of chickens - colonisation of the caecum, liver and spleen
both on day  <dig> and day  <dig>  no significant differences in caecal colonisation were observed amongst all the mutants . when the ability to persist in internal organs was analysed, the mutants could be clustered into  <dig> different groups as summarised in table  <dig>  the first group consisted of the wild-type strain and the Δspi <dig>  Δspi <dig> and Δspi <dig> mutants. these strains colonised the liver and spleen with equal efficiency. the second group was formed by Δspi1- <dig>  and the spi3o, spi4o and spi5o mutants characterised by their inability to reach and persist in the liver and spleen of chickens. the last group was formed by Δspi <dig>  Δspi <dig>  and the spi1o and spi2o mutants which exhibited an intermediate ability to persist in liver and spleen of infected chickens .

wt - wild-type s. enteritidis 147; Δspi1-5: mutant from which all major  <dig> spi have been removed; Δspi <dig>  Δspi <dig>  Δspi <dig>  Δspi <dig>  Δspi5: mutants from which the respective spi has been removed; spi1o, spi2o, spi3o, spi4o, spi5o: mutants with only the respective spi retained

the above-mentioned data indicated that spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> were the two major pathogenicity islands required for chicken colonisation. to verify this, in the next step we constructed two additional mutants - the first one without both the spi- <dig> and spi- <dig>  and the second one with only the spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> retained , and we repeated the infections including the wild-type s. enteritidis strain and s. enteritidis Δspi1- <dig> mutant as controls. the presence of only these two spis allowed the spi1&2o mutant to colonise the liver almost as efficiently as did the wild-type strain although this mutant exhibited a minor defect in spleen colonisation indicating the cumulative influence of spi- <dig>  spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> on the spleen-colonising ability of s. enteritidis. the defect could be observed both on day  <dig> and day  <dig> although a statistically significant difference from the both the wild type strain and the Δspi1- <dig> mutant infected chickens could be detected only on day  <dig>  on the other hand, the mutant without these  <dig> spis behaved exactly as the Δspi1- <dig> mutant and was only rarely recovered from the liver and spleen .

histology in chickens
histological examination revealed no differences in the livers of chickens infected with any of the mutants or with the wild-type strain. on the other hand, different degrees of inflammation and heterophil infiltration were found in the caeca on day  <dig>  and this infiltration was dependent on the presence of spi- <dig>  the Δspi <dig> mutant was the only single spi deletion mutant which induced significantly less heterophil infiltration than the wild-type s. enteritidis, and chickens infected with this mutant did not differ from those infected with the Δspi1- <dig> or the non-infected chickens . by day  <dig>  none of the spi 'only' mutants stimulated heterophil infiltration any longer, and also the heterophil infiltration in chickens infected with the Δspi <dig> mutant remained at quite a low level. in chickens infected with the wild-type strain, heterophil infiltration dropped between day  <dig> and day  <dig> and heterophil infiltration induced by the wild type strain on day  <dig> was similar to that induced by the Δspi <dig> mutant .

proinflammatory cytokine response
previous experiments had shown that the early heterophil infiltration decreased with the loss of spi- <dig>  we therefore tested cytokine signalling in the caeca of chickens infected with the Δspi <dig>  Δspi <dig> and Δspi1& <dig> mutants. for all the cytokines measured, an identical trend was observed - the highest induction was observed in chickens after infection with the wild type strain, followed by those infected with Δspi <dig>  Δspi <dig> and Δspi1& <dig> mutants, respectively . except for il-12β, the expression of the remaining cytokines after infection with the wild-type strain and the Δspi <dig> mutant significantly differed from the expression observed in non-infected control chickens while the differences between the non-infected chickens and those infected with the Δspi <dig> and Δspi1& <dig> mutant were always insignificant.

discussion
in this study we were interested in the role of five major pathogenicity islands in the virulence of s. enteritidis for chickens. rather unexpectedly, none of the pathogenicity islands was essential for colonisation of the intestinal tract despite the fact that other studies demonstrated that single gene spi- <dig> mutants in chickens or spi- <dig> mutants in cattle showed impaired intestinal colonisation and/or mucosa invasion  <cit> . we cannot exclude the possibility that, if the infectious dose was changed or the duration of animal infection was extended for a longer period of time, we would observe a correlation between the persistence in the gut and the presence of a particular spi. it is also possible that the differences between a single gene mutant and the whole spi- <dig> mutant are biologically relevant because in mice a difference in the behaviour of the whole spi- <dig> mutant and a hila mutant was observed. this difference has been explained by the presence of the spi- <dig> localised genes stimulating the host's immune response, the effect of which is suppressed in the presence of intact hila  <cit> . finally, it is also possible that a low-level expression of spi- <dig> encoded t3ss, which is likely to occur in the hila mutant, might be still high enough to induce the interference with some of the eukaryotic host cell function resulting in a Δspi <dig> mutant phenotype different from that of single gene mutants used in the above-mentioned other studies.

although no influence of spis on gut colonisation was observed, spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> pathogenicity islands were both required for s. enteritidis colonisation of the liver and spleen, similar to previous studies  <cit> . interestingly, the decrease in counts of the Δspi <dig> and Δspi <dig> mutants in the liver and spleen was numerically not as high as that observed for single gene spi- <dig> mutants in mice  <cit> . the importance of these two spis for s. enteritidis colonisation of the liver and spleen of chickens was further supported by the behaviour of spi1o and spi2o mutants which, when compared with the Δspi1- <dig> mutant, had a significantly higher ability to colonise the spleen of infected chicken, and also by the Δspi1& <dig> mutant which did not differ in colonisation of liver and spleen from the Δspi1- <dig> mutant. interestingly, the deletion of spi- <dig> resulted in a significant difference from the wild type strain liver colonisation on day  <dig> but not on day  <dig> in agreement with the results of desin et al.  <cit>  suggesting that decreased liver colonisation by the Δspi <dig> mutant might be caused by its slower translocation through the gut epithelium. on the other hand, the Δspi <dig> mutant showed decreased liver colonisation both on day  <dig> and day  <dig> when compared with the wild-type strain, which is consistent with the role of spi- <dig> encoded proteins in intra-macrophage survival  <cit> . the importance of spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> was further confirmed by the virulence of spi1o and spi2o mutants because the presence of each of these pathogenicity islands individually increased the virulence of s. enteritidis for chickens. our observations on spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> as the most important spis are similar to those of dieye et al. except for the fact that we could not confirm that spi- <dig> would be more important than spi- <dig> for salmonella infection of chickens  <cit>  although we did observe that spi- <dig> was the most important for the induction of inflammation as supported by the cytokine inductions and the influx of heterophils. interestingly, unlike the bovine and murine models  <cit> , we did not observe any correlation between the absence of spi- <dig> and the induction of proinflammatory or any other cytokines in the avian caeca. furthermore, we did not observe any effect of spi- <dig>  spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> deletions on the virulence of s. enteritidis for chickens. this agrees with the observations of morgan et al. who showed that spi- <dig> genes were superfluous and spi- <dig> genes and the pipb gene of spi- <dig> played only a minor role in the colonisation of the chicken gut by s. typhimurium  <cit> . however since the spi1&2o mutant showed reduced ability to colonise the spleen  <dig> days post infection when compared with the wild-type s. enteritidis infection, this shows that spi- <dig>  spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> collectively influenced the virulence of s. enteritidis for chickens although these  <dig> spis individually did not contribute to the ability of s. enteritidis to colonise the spleen of infected chickens.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have shown that spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> pathogenicity islands are central to the virulence of s. enteritidis for chickens. the presence of either of these two pathogenicity islands resulted in a significant increase in the liver and spleen colonisation by s. enteritidis. the remaining three major pathogenicity islands  influenced s. enteritidis virulence for day-old chickens collectively but not individually.
