BACKGROUND
tuberculosis , a chronic illness caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis, is still a major worldwide disease. pathogenic mycobacteria species have demonstrated a remarkable ability to survive in diverse conditions encountered during the infection process. however, even after decades of investigation, there is still little knowledge about mycobacterial pathogenesis. understanding the infective process at the molecular and cellular levels will lead to new strategies to control this disease and even to the development of an effective vaccine.

the analysis of the complete sequence of the m. tuberculosis h37rv genome revealed the presence of four paralogous mce genes, all encoded in an operon structure consisting of eight genes  <cit> . the biological function of mce proteins is not known, but increasing evidence has demonstrated that they are clearly related to the virulence of mycobacterium tuberculosis complex species  <cit> .

gene regulation is considered to play a central role in host-microbe interactions, and many virulence genes are regulated in response to the host. casali and collaborators  <cit>  identified a regulatory mechanism which controls mce <dig> expression. they have demonstrated that a homologue of the fadr subfamily of gntr transcriptional regulators, rv0165c , is a negative regulator that intracellularly represses expression of the mce <dig> operon. in addition, a gene encoding a putative transcriptional factor, rv <dig>  is located immediately upstream of mce <dig> operon and it is transcribed in the same direction as that of mce <dig> genes. furthermore, it has been found that there are growth phase and tissue specific differences in the expression of mce operons in m. tuberculosis  <cit>  which is in agreement with the presence of regulatory mechanisms controlling mce transcription. in a previous work, we found evidence indicating that mce3r, a tetr family transcriptional regulator, down-regulates the mce <dig> operon during the in vitro growing of m. tuberculosis  <cit> . we have demonstrated that the overexpression of mce3r in both m. smegmatis and m. tuberculosis abolishes the expression of a gene reporter fused to mce <dig> promoter.

tetr family members often regulate their own synthesis  <cit> . the classic example of self regulation in members of this family protein is a repressor involved in resistance to tetracycline of escherichia coli, which has given the name tetr to the group  <cit> . in a number of tetr-autoregulated systems the regulator and the structural genes are divergently transcribed and the region for protein binding overlaps the promoters placed in the intergenic region  <cit> . that is the case of mce3r, which is placed upstream of mce <dig> operon, oriented in the opposite direction and separated from it by a region of  <dig> bp.

in this work we validate the role of mce3r in repressing the mce <dig> transcription in m. tuberculosis by analyzing gene expression in a mce3r-knockout m. tuberculosis strain. we also found that this regulation is exclusive for the mce <dig> operon among mce genes and that the mce3r repressor regulates its own expression.

RESULTS
construction of a mce3r mutant in m. tuberculosis
as a first step to assess the mce <dig> operon expression in the absence of mce3r, we obtained a knockout mutant strain of m. tuberculosis h37rv by inserting a hygromycin cassette into the mce3r gene. the site-directed mutant strain of m. tuberculosis was obtained by two-step mutagenesis strategy by using the p2nil shuttle plasmid  <cit> , which carries the lacz gene and the counter selectable marker sacb. allelic exchange was confirmed in the selected clones  by southern blotting , since the mutant showed a hybridizing fragment of about  <dig>  kb absent in the wild-type strain. this polymorphism is due to the introduction of an extra ecori site present in the hygromycin cassette . the mutant strain was designated Δmce3r. the mutation was complemented by transforming the plasmid psummce3r into the mutant.

in vitro characterization of Δmce3r
to determine whether mce3r disruption introduces alterations during in vitro growth, growth curves of the Δmce3r mutant, complemented, and parental strains were compared under standard culture conditions. all assayed strains showed similar doubling time and growth characteristics throughout the culture period . this result indicates that the mutation does not affect the in vitro growth of m. tuberculosis.

mce <dig> operon expression is repressed by mce3r during in vitro culture and inside murine macrophages
we have previously demonstrated that the mce <dig> promoter allows the expression of the lacz reporter gene in m. tuberculosis h37rv but that this expression is completely abolished when mce3r is overexpressed in the h37rv strain from a multi-copy plasmid  <cit> . although these findings constitute initial evidence demonstrating the role of mce3r as a repressor of the mce <dig> operon transcription, the presence of an endogenous copy of the mce3r gene in m. tuberculosis did not enable us to determine the conditions in which the regulator system operates.

here, in order to compare the expression the mce <dig> operon either in the absence or in the presence of mce3r, dna fusions of the mce <dig> promoter to lacz reporter, containing or not containing mce3r were cloned within pyub178-lacz. the resulting plasmids, pp3-mce3r and pp <dig> respectively, were integrated into the chromosome of the Δmce3r strain. the β-galactosidase activity was measured at different points along cultures of m. tuberculosis grown in vitro and in a macrophages cell line. since transcription of mce <dig> genes has previously shown to be increased when m. tuberculosis was grown in rich media  <cit>  the expression of mce <dig> operon was assessed in both synthetic  and rich  media .

while hardly any β-galactosidase activity was detected either in in vitro cultures  or in cell-line mice macrophages  in the presence of mce3r , the activity in the Δmce3r::pp <dig> strain was remarkably high in all of the conditions tested. the promoter activity increased along the in vitro cultures of Δmce3r:: pp <dig>  and peaked at  <dig> h of infection inside the cell. these results clearly indicate that mce3r represses the expression of mce <dig> operon in m. tuberculosis in the growth conditions tested.

assessment of the role of mce3r in the transcription of the four mce operons
a number of reports indicate that the expression of all mce genes depends on the growth conditions  <cit> . these observations, together with the findings that regulatory proteins are involved in the expression of the mce <dig> and mce <dig> operons, suggested the idea of a broader regulatory mechanism differentially controlling the expression of mce genes. in order to test whether mce3r is able to control the transcription of the other mce operons apart from mce <dig>  the expression of one gene from each mce operon in the mutant strain was compared with that of the wild type. primers were designed to amplify a  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp region on mce1d , mce2a , mce3e , mce4a , and siga respectively. amplicons of expected size were obtained with each pair of primers .

differences in relative gene expression between the wild type and the mutant strains were assessed in group means for statistical significance by a randomisation test . while the relative abundance of mce3e mrna was significantly higher  in the mutant than in the wild type strain in the conditions evaluated, no significant differences between both strains were observed on the expression of mce1d , mce2a  and mce4a  .

to verify that rna samples were not contaminated with genomic dna, rt-pcr reactions were performed without the addition of reverse transcriptase. the lack of amplification products verifies that the rt-pcr products were amplified from rna that had been reversely transcribed into cdna.

these results demonstrate that mce3r regulates exclusively the transcription of mce <dig> operon among mce genes in the conditions tested

mce3r expression is self regulated
to investigate whether mce3r is subject to transcriptional autoregulation, a transcriptional fusion was constructed between the mce3r promoter and the lacz reporter. since mce3r is located adjacent to mce <dig> operon and divergently oriented, the mce3r promoter is situated in mce3r-yrbe3a intergenic region. the entire intergenic region was fused to the lacz gene within pyub178-lacz to create plasmid ppr3-lacz. the ppr3-lacz plasmid was transformed into the wild type m. tuberculosis h37rv and the m. tuberculosis Δmce3r mutant, and β-galactosidase activity was measured to assess the levels of mce3r promoter activity with and without mce3r regulator. as shown in figure  <dig>  in the presence of mce3r  the activity of mce3r promoter is steadily and significantly reduced as compared with that in the absence of the mce3r regulator . this reduction in mce3r promoter activity was more evident during the stationary growth phase. these experiments demonstrate that the mce3r protein is able to transcriptionally repress expression of the mce3r promoter in m. tuberculosis during the in vitro culture condition tested.

discussion
little is known about gene regulation of virulence factors in m. tuberculosis due to its slow growth rate and the late development of mycobacterial genetics. prokaryotic transcriptional regulators are classified in families on the basis of sequence similarity and structural and functional criteria. the tetr family, a family of transcriptional regulators that is well represented and widely distributed among bacteria, has a helix turn-helix  signature, the most recurrent dna binding motif, to bind its target dna. members of the tetr family of repressors control transcription of proteins involved in multidrug resistance, enzymes implicated in different catabolic pathways, biosynthesis of antibiotics, osmotic stress, and pathogenicity of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. at least  <dig> putative tetr-family regulator genes are spread on the m. tuberculosis genome. most of them are similar to the tetr/acrr family, but just a few have been characterized. mce3r was the first tetr-like regulator studied in m. tuberculosis  <cit> . then, engohang-ndong et al.  <cit>  found that a member of the tetr/camr family represses the expression of etha that encodes a protein that catalyses the activation of ethionamide . eth is an important second-line anti tb drug used for the treatment of patients infected with multidrug-resistant strains.

the transcription profile of the mce <dig> operon in different in vitro growth conditions of m. tuberculosis has been addressed by rt-pcr in a number of publications and transcription of mce <dig> genes has been found when bacteria were cultured both on lj and dubos media  <cit>  but not in 7h <dig> synthetic medium in both exponential and stationary growth phases  <cit> . using similar methodology we detected mrna of mce <dig> operon during in vitro culture of m. tuberculosis either in synthetic or in rich  media. however, transcription from the mce <dig> promoter, measured as β-galacosidase activity, was completely absent in the presence of mce3r both in in vitro conditions and inside a murine macrophages cell line. these last results, together with the finding that the elimination of mce3r significantly increases mce <dig> transcription, indicate that the potential level of mce <dig> expression is repressed in the conditions of growth assayed.

interestingly, the high homology among mce operons is not conserved among their regulator genes, since mce1r, the other mce regulator described, as well as the putative regulator of the mce <dig> operon, belong to the gntr family  <cit> . in addition, no putative regulatory gene is placed in the vicinity of the mce <dig> operon; however, it was recently proposed rv <dig>  a tetr-type regulator, as represor of mce <dig> operon expression  <cit> .

here it was demonstrated that mce3r is not involved in the expression of mce <dig>  mce <dig> nor mce <dig> operons. therefore, it is tempting to speculate that both facts, i.e. gene redundancy and differential regulation, ensure the production of mce proteins in different environments.

here we demonstrated that mce <dig> promoter is stronger than mce3r promoter, and mce <dig> expression seems to be mostly shut down during in vitro growth, but it is also likely that under unknown particular conditions of growth it would turn on.

as it happens to many other proteins of the tetr family, we found that mce3r negatively regulates its own expression. the experiments with the mce3r promoter indicate that there is in average ten folds decreased in transcriptional activity when the mce3r is provided. in this condition, the activity of mce <dig> promoter is sixty times repressed. since the mce3r – yrbe3a intergenic region spans  <dig> bp, it is likely that mce3r binds to consensus motifs located between the divergent genes in both promoter regions.

although this study provides more insights to the role of mce3r in the regulation of the mce operons, the information is still limited and further studies are necessary to detect any other gene regulated by this system. elucidation of other promoters targeted by mce3r will lead to the definition of a consensus mce3r-binding site and the possibility of define the mce3r-regulon. thus, one could hope to decipher the function of mce <dig> genes by the identification of the mce3r regulon.

CONCLUSIONS
the available evidence demonstrates that while mce3r represses powerfully the transcription of mce <dig> operon in vitro and inside macrophages, it does not affect the transcription of mce <dig>  mce <dig> and mce <dig> operons during in vitro culture of m. tuberculosis. it was also demonstrated that mce3r negatively regulates its own expression but the level of expression is lower than that observed for mce <dig> operon.
