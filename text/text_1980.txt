BACKGROUND
trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan parasite of the order kinetoplastida, is the causative agent of chagas disease in latin america. this protist, like the african trypanosome trypanosoma brucei, has a complex life cycle and alternates between insect vectors and mammalian hosts. being a single cell that suffers continuous environmental changes, t. cruzi needs to quickly regulate the expression of many genes to allow rapid adaptation . such microorganisms control protein synthesis mostly by post-transcriptional mechanisms. transcription in trypanosomes is polycistronic  <cit>  and, in contrast to what occurs in bacterial operons, polycistronic units must be co-transcriptionally processed before translation  <cit> , by coupled 5'-trans-splicing and 3'-polyadenylation events  <cit> . however, with a single exception  <cit> , no classical promoters have been identified in trypanosomes, and thus there is no evidence for controlled transcriptional initiation of genes through modulation of rna polymerase ii activity  <cit> . given these peculiarities, trypanosomes represent an interesting model for studies on mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression  <cit> , in which mrna degradation/stabilization is the main control feature. active deadenylation systems have been found in trypanosome cells  <cit> . after removal of the poly tail and the 5'-cap, the mrna can be degraded from both ends by xrn1-related exoribonucleases  and the exosome  . rna interference is also involved in gene-silencing phenomena in some species of the trypanosomatidae family  <cit> .

mature transcripts contain regulatory motifs located in the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions  that modulate transcript abundance by specific interaction with rna-binding proteins . these cis-elements are involved in the control of mrna transport, stability, and translation efficiency  <cit> . several rbps form, together with mrnas, a network of messenger-ribonucleoprotein  complexes directing post-transcriptional regulation in response to diverse stimuli  <cit> . an important class of these factors contains an rna-binding domain called rna-recognition motif   <cit> .

the genome sequencing projects of three trypanosomatids  was completed in  <dig>  <cit> , providing crucial data for study of gene content and genome organization. specifically, a superfamily of more than  <dig> rrm-type proteins was discovered in the t. cruzi genome  <cit> . some are involved in alternative splicing processes, mrna stabilization/degradation, polyadenylation, or translational control. however, the majority do not have clear homologs in other species, even though they are highly conserved in kinetoplastids. among them, a family containing about  <dig> members, shares a common rrm sequence but contain different auxiliary domains  <cit> . one member of this protein family is t. cruzi u-rich rbp  <dig>   <cit> , a single rrm domain cytoplasmic rbp with a characteristic βαββαβ-fold flanked by n-terminal gln-rich and c-terminal gly-gln-rich extensions that are likely involved in protein-protein interactions  <cit> . this protein shares almost the same rrm sequence  with a second rbp family member termed tcubp <dig>  previous work from our laboratory has shown that both proteins can form a complex with poly-binding protein pabp <dig> at the 3'-utr of mucin transcripts, producing selective destabilization of such mrnas  <cit> . t. cruzi rbp  <dig>  is a third rbp family member that shares less than 60% identity with the rrm domain of tcubp <dig>  <cit> ; this is reflected in different in vitro binding characteristics . t. brucei has homologous rbps, two of these, termed tbubp <dig> and tbubp <dig>  are involved in stabilization of cyclin f box mrna and a transmembrane protein gene family  <cit> .

to understand the possible roles of trypanosome rbps, it is necessary to identify mrna targets whose half-lives or activities are modulated by interactions with the rbps. tcubp <dig> has been reported to bind to 3'-utr sequences encompassing au-rich elements  with auuua, auuuua, and auuuuua motifs, and showed specificity for poly and poly homoribopolymers. tcrbp <dig> displayed a different homoribopolymer-binding pattern, showing specificity for poly, poly, and poly  <cit> . in this study, we systematically identified cellular targets for tcubp <dig> and tcrbp <dig> and report on structural rna elements conserved in each group of transcripts. these signature rna motifs were successfully used to predict putative tcubp <dig> and tcrbp <dig> target mrnas from trypanosome databases.

RESULTS
identification of tcubp <dig> and tcrbp <dig> mrna targets
a comparative rna-protein interaction analysis was performed using mrnp immunopurification assays, with the aid of specific antibodies raised against each rrm-type protein, tcubp <dig> and tcrbp <dig>  these two rbps show distinct amino acid compositions in their rrm regions . in particular, the sequences demonstrate differences within the loops of the rna-binding domain spatial structure, which has been shown to confer specificity for rna-binding in other proteins  <cit> . in addition, both proteins differ at one amino acid position , which is one of the four tcubp <dig> residues  predicted to be involved in rna recognition  <cit> . to determine if this change might influence the nature of transcripts with which the rbps can associate, cytosolic cell-free extracts of t. cruzi epimastigotes prepared under conditions that preserved mrna-protein interactions were incubated with either anti-tcubp <dig> or anti-tcrbp <dig> antibodies. the rna extracted from mrnp complexes was reverse transcribed using an oligo primer, amplified by pcr, and used to construct a library of transcripts associated with each protein . a fraction  of the immunoprecipitation  material was used to analyze proteins by western-blot assays. as shown in figure 2b, each antibody can specifically detect unique bands of the expected sizes in protein extracts . furthermore, tcubp <dig> was specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-tcubp <dig> antibody, whereas tcrbp <dig> was found in the tcrbp3-ip material. in contrast, both proteins were undetectable in the reciprocal ip assay or when the ip was performed using preimmune serum.

our analysis revealed that, among the identified tcubp1-bound mrnas,  <dig> sequences shared significant similarity  to known genes and  <dig> to hypothetical protein transcripts. a large proportion of the transcripts identified code for proteins involved in metabolism or glycoproteins. the list of tcubp <dig> target hits is shown in table  <dig>  transcripts found in tcrbp <dig> ip material comprise  <dig> hypothetical proteins and  <dig> annotated mrnas, including  <dig> different ribosomal protein-encoding  genes of large and small subunit proteins . rpc transcripts are abundant cellular mrnas that may co-precipitate non-specifically; their detection might thus be attributable to non-specific association. however, these transcripts were not immunoprecipitated by preimmune serum or an unrelated rbp antibody , indicating that the rpc genes identified are bona fide targets. sequences reported as expressed sequence tags  were also present in both ips. in addition, common targets such as 28s ribosomal rna  , 18s rrna , hypothetical protein  <dig>   and mitochondrial transcripts , were found in both ubp1- and rbp3-ips . a preimmune serum and anti-tcrpi antibody were used as controls and did not immunoprecipitate visible amounts of mrna .

specific mrna targets are differentially represented when comparing tcubp1- and tcrbp3-containing mrnp complexes
the presence of target mrnas in mrnp complexes was validated in ip reactions using antibodies against individual rbps. bound rnas were reverse transcribed and the presence of several randomly chosen targets from each library was analyzed by pcr. all transcripts expected to bind to tcubp <dig> or tcrbp <dig> were confirmed to be present in each ip sample. a control mrna encoding tcrbp <dig> , a transcript that does not bind to any of the rbps tested, gave negative results. in all cases, samples were incubated with rnase-free dnase before reverse transcription and negative controls without reverse transcriptase were included to exclude the possibility of contamination with genomic dna . non-specific rna-protein associations were determined by parallel incubations with preimmune serum, and undetectable or low levels of pcr amplification signals were obtained from these controls . we and other authors  <cit>  have observed pcr products in immunoprecipitates performed with control serum. however, these bands were in all cases much fainter than bands present in ip samples obtained using antibodies against the rbps. some tcubp <dig> targets derived from the library were found in tcrbp3-ip material, and sequenced targets for tcrbp <dig> were also present in the group of purified transcripts obtained using anti-tcubp <dig> antibodies. however, semiquantitative rt-pcr reactions demonstrated that specific transcripts were enriched in each sample . to further analyze these results, tcubp1- and tcrbp3-associated transcripts in each ip were measured using real-time pcr. specific primers for zinc finger protein  <dig>  , pyruvate dehydrogenase e <dig> subunit beta  , ribosomal protein s <dig>  , and calpain-like cysteine peptidase   were used. real-time pcr was performed on samples immunoprecipitated with antibodies against tcubp <dig> or tcrbp <dig>  so it was not possible to use a reference transcript to standardize the assays. to overcome this drawback, we compared the ratios of the values obtained for each tcubp <dig> target mrna over each tcrbp <dig> transcript within tcubp1-ip or tcrbp3-ip material . the data presented in figure 3b are representative of three independent assays. the results indicated that tcubp <dig> target transcripts were enriched in tcubp <dig> ip material. thus, zfp <dig>  levels were 24- and 14-fold more abundant than those of calp and rps <dig> , respectively; and pdh levels  were 3- and  <dig> -fold higher than those of calp and rps <dig>  these ratios were lower in the group of tcrbp3-associated transcripts .

reciprocal analysis of the relative ratios of tcrbp <dig> over tcubp <dig> targets in the pool of tcrbp3-bound mrnas showed that calp levels were  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold higher than those of zfp <dig> and pdh, respectively, and similar values  were found when rps <dig> was analyzed. as anticipated, these ratios were significantly lower in the tcubp1-ip material .

mitochondrial transcripts and rrnas were repeatedly found in both tcubp1- and tcrbp3-ip samples. as these transcripts are highly abundant, and as neither rbp is localized in mitochondria , they probably correspond to background noise arising from non-physiological association during isolation  <cit> . to address this controversial result, and to obtain evidence for the occurrence of the observed interactions in intact cells, formaldehyde treatment prior to cell lysis was performed to crosslink rnp complexes in living parasites. analysis of rna present in ip-samples isolated from treated cells further supported the endogenous interaction of both proteins with rrnas and confirmed several tcubp1- and tcrbp3-associated transcripts as in vivo targets . in contrast, mitochondrial transcripts were not found in association with either rbp in cells treated by crosslinking, thus demonstrating that such interactions were non-physiological . in summary, these data allow us to conclude that most mrnas identified in our libraries  are likely to be rbp-target transcripts. although both tcrbps can share target transcripts, each preferentially binds a given set of mrnas.

identification of conserved motifs for tcubp <dig> and tcrbp <dig> binding in target transcripts
we next sought to determine whether each set of experimentally bound mrnas might contain common sequence elements, using two motif-discovery tools  based on both primary rna sequences and secondary structures. among several candidate motifs, one cis-element for each protein, termed ubp1m and rbp3m, were further analyzed. these were selected because they were present in most experimental targets identified but were of minor occurrence in the entire t. cruzi refseq database . a common stem-loop structure within these sequences was observed, suggesting that the tcubp <dig> and tcrbp <dig> proteins might recognize structural elements rather than a particular sequence in the mrnas. this means that different mrnas might harbor the same structural motif even though they do not share the same sequence. figure  <dig> shows the frequency of nucleotides at each position obtained from multiple alignment of the elements found within all of the target transcripts. five representative examples of sequences and secondary structures in distinct mrnas are also graphically represented .

refseq database is composed of trypanosome full length mrnas and experimental dataset represent the 3' utr of transcripts. the score value represents the relationship between both frequencies.

covariance model searches  <cit>  allowed us to identify transcripts in databases that contained each of the motifs analyzed. these mrnas are novel putative targets for each of the tcubp <dig> and tcrbp <dig> proteins . a total of  <dig>  additional est targets  were identified using ubp1m in the search. in addition,  <dig> database transcripts  bearing rbp3m were found. table  <dig> shows the percentages of experimentally selected transcripts harboring the motifs and compares it with the percentages of transcripts in the refseq database  bearing the motifs. the results show that the selected motifs are enriched in the experimental dataset compared with the entire transcriptome. although most of the tcubp <dig> experimental targets  contain one or two copies of ubp1m, some lack this motif, indicating that other motifs may also be relevant for tcubp <dig> binding. similarly, rbp3m was represented in ~70% of the experimental dataset, which also suggests the existence of alternative motifs involved in tcrbp <dig> binding .

we next assigned relative frequencies to both motifs, reflecting the number of hits found in each group of transcripts divided by its sequence length . ubp1m and rbp3m were  <dig> - and ~19-fold, respectively, overrepresented in the experimental dataset compared with the t. cruzi refseq database . moreover, when the relative frequencies of motifs within 5'-upstream genomic sequences , coding sequences , and 3'-downstream genomic sequences , of the experimental dataset and the t. cruzi cl brener genomic sequence database were compared, a higher enrichment in the 3'-ds was observed, denoting a preferred 3'-utr localization for both motifs . taken together, these results demonstrate that the structural elements identified in trypanosomal transcripts are conserved and enriched within the experimental set of transcripts and that these motifs are preferentially localized in the 3'-utrs.

frequency  of motifs in experimental and tcruzidb cl brener genomic sequence release  <dig>  fractioned in  <dig> subsets compose of 5' us, cds and 3'ds .

rna motifs enhance rna-tcubp <dig> or -tcrbp <dig> interactions
the capacity of each rrm-type protein to bind biotinylated transcripts harboring the described motifs was tested. the rna-protein complexes were pulled-down with streptavidin-coated beads and the presence of the protein revealed by western blotting. zfp1m is a short region of the zfp <dig> mrna that contains ubp1m, whereas rps5m is a portion of the rps <dig> transcript harboring rbp3m . both fragments were inserted into a pgem-t polylinker transcript and are termed pgem-t zfp1m and pgem-t rps5m, respectively. a pgem-t polylinker transcript without any insert was used as a negative control because in silico predictions indicated that this sequence did not contain any of the motifs under analysis. rnas were transcribed in vitro in the presence of ctp-biotin and incubated with recombinant gst-tagged tcubp <dig>  tcrbp <dig>  or gst alone . pgem-t zfp1m effectively pulled-down tcubp <dig> protein but failed to show binding to tcrbp <dig> or to control gst protein. in contrast, pgem-t rps5m, pulled-down tcrbp <dig> but not tcubp <dig> or gst . the control transcript  failed to show binding to any of the tcrbps.

to analyze if the stem-loop structures identified might be involved in the interaction of proteins with target mrnas, the following transcripts were transcribed and used in rna-binding assays:  rnas comprising short flanking regions with either ubp1m or rbp3m ;  rnas lacking the motifs but containing only the flanking regions ; and,  rnas in which the motifs of interest were replaced by different sequences . as shown in figure 5a and 5b, weak binding was seen when the motifs were absent  or when they were substituted by other sequences . it is to be noted that rbp <dig> did not bind to rps5m  construct albeit it folds into a stem-loop structure. besides, it did not bind other predicted stem-loops such as the one present in the zfp <dig> 3'-utr showed in figure 4d, indicating that slight differences in the rna structure affect rna-binding. contrary, transcripts bearing complete ubp1m or rbp3m motifs showed considerably enhanced interactions with the corresponding rbps. taken together, these results demonstrate that the identified rna elements are involved in interactions with rbps and that transcripts can be rendered targets for ubp <dig> or rbp <dig> by addition of the correct rna motif.

assessment of the validity of novel target transcripts identified in databases
to test the usefulness of ubp1m and rbp3m elements in predicting novel targets, we first manually classified  all motif-containing sequences obtained from dbest, which had been previously filtered using the annotation file provided by tigr  <cit>  . target mrnas present in each experimental dataset were also classified . the overall distribution of transcripts in these groups was similar when comparing database and experimental targets for each of tcubp <dig> and tcrbp <dig> proteins, but was different when the comparison was performed between targets of both proteins . thus, a statistically significant difference  was found between the distribution of ubp <dig> and rbp <dig> database targets. although mrnas from various categories were identified, groups with larger numbers of transcripts were found. mrnas coding for proteins involved in general metabolic pathways are overrepresented in both datasets of tcubp <dig> targets analyzed. conversely, rpc transcripts are the most distinctive group among tcrbp <dig> database and experimental targets.

we then investigated whether some of the putative database targets identified in silico might indeed be able to interact with the corresponding rbp. in vivo ip assays were performed and rt-pcr was used to detect transcripts encoding the 29-kda proteasome subunit class ii mrna   and paraflagellar rod component  <dig> mrna  , both of which are putative targets for tcubp <dig>  and ribosomal protein s <dig> mrna   and membrane transporter protein mrna  , both of which are predicted targets for tcrbp <dig>  the association of database targets with the two proteins was then investigated by rna extraction from purified mrnp complexes followed by rt-pcr. all database targets studied were found in the pool of bound rnas . in summary, the motifs identified for tcubp <dig> or tcrbp <dig> binding can be effectively used to identify novel target transcripts for both rbps. furthermore, these results allowed us to recognize groups of mrnas with common functions as potential binding partners for each protein.

common target rnas for tcubp <dig> and tcrbp3
based on the above data on rna-protein interactions, demonstrating that both rbps can share transcripts, we sought to identify whether some targets might also contain both previously described motifs, ubp1m and rbp3m. eleven database transcripts might potentially be common to both proteins . this list includes rpc genes , pdh, and histones, among others. interestingly, the hypo <dig> gene  is a library-derived target for both rbps , bearing a region in which ubp1m intersects rbp3m. here, the two motifs are superimposed in the same region inside the 3'-utr  . in vitro binding assays were performed to investigate whether both proteins could bind to and compete for this region. as shown in figure 7c, increasing amounts of tcrbp <dig> in the presence of fixed amounts of tcubp <dig> caused a reduction in binding to tcubp <dig>  these observations showed that both proteins bind to common sites in hypo <dig> 3'-utr in a competitive manner and support the view that tcubp <dig> and tcrbp <dig> can share rna targets.

additional motifs can also govern the binding of tcrbps to target transcripts
to obtain additional evidence for the existence of common transcript targets for both rbps, we analyzed the list of other possible cis-elements mentioned above. about  <dig> motifs enriched in the group of experimental targets for each rbp were found , and all shared a common stem-loop structure. the overall distribution of motifs within some transcripts was analyzed. a 'hot spot' region for motifs was observed, and some overlapped at the primary sequence level, suggesting that binding sites could not be defined simply by structure. tcrbp <dig> motifs can be found in some tcubp1-bound mrnas and vice versa. there are also regions bearing tcubp <dig> and tcrbp <dig> motifs. for example, a portion of ubp1m in the zfp <dig> 3'-utr coincides with ubp1-m <dig> and ubp1-m <dig>  downstream, the putative motifs detected for tcubp <dig> extend beyond the potential motif for tcrbp <dig> .

percentage of transcripts bearing the motif in the experimental dataset and trypanosome est database are shown. Δ, indicates the difference between both percentages.

some mrnas contain several motifs for either tcubp <dig> or tcrbp <dig>  indicating that certain rna signals may be redundantly present. thus, binding of both rbps might occur at distinct sites of 3'-utr target mrnas . in accordance with previous results, tcrbp <dig> database targets with several motifs include rpc genes  were found. to determine if the additional motifs identified might be functional in terms of binding to transcripts, a region of parb <dig> 3'-utr that contains overlapping motifs  for each protein was analyzed . first, rt-pcr with ip samples was performed to show that parb <dig> 3'-utr is a target for both proteins. second, the ability of both rbps to bind the region of the parb <dig> 3'-utr that contains ubp1-m <dig> and rbp3-m <dig> was confirmed . in contrast, both rbps were incapable of interacting with a portion of the utr deficient in these motifs . these data demonstrate that tcrbps can bind to more than one motif and suggest that subsets of cellular targets for each protein may be determined by the combination of different possible motifs within these transcripts.

discussion
the functionality of the rna molecule depends not only on primary sequence information but also on secondary folding. work on rna motif discovery is relevant to better understand the metabolism of rna, which essentially relies on interaction of transcripts with proteins. in recent years, high-throughput techniques have been developed to map post-transcriptional networks; these combine the isolation and identification of mrnas from cell extracts  with ribotrap analysis to determine bound proteins  <cit> . methods to detect structural elements in a set of rna molecules were recently published  <cit> , and a web server for rna data analysis, with significant capabilities for rna secondary structures prediction was released  <cit> . in this work, rna structural elements were identified in target transcripts of two different rrm-containing trypanosomal rbps  <cit> . this subject is particularly relevant to work with kinetoplastid parasites, because gene expression in such cells is basically controlled at the post-transcriptional level. it is known that regulatory regions of transcripts contain cis-elements that determine the fate of monocistronic mrnas by interaction with specific trans-acting rbps, but much work remains to be done to determine these molecular mechanisms  <cit> . targets for trypanosome rrm-type proteins have been studied for only a few rbps, such as the puf family members in t. brucei and t. cruzi  <cit> . in the present work, a library of transcripts extracted from tcubp1- or tcrbp3-containing mrnp complexes allowed the identification of target mrnas. signature motifs in these transcripts were found and shown to be useful, in turn, in the prediction of other putative transcript targets in databases. some of these mrnas were shown to be complexed with the relevant proteins, thus confirming the feasibility of the approach for the identification of groups of transcripts binding to a given rbp.

distinct categories of sequence motifs involved in multiple levels of mrna metabolism have previously been mapped in trypanosomes . for example, a 26-mer u-rich bloodstream-form instability element  <cit>  and a 16-mer stem-loop required for efficient translation  <cit>  were both described in the 3'-utr of the ep procyclin t. brucei transcript. these regulatory signals are common to several genes. in leishmania, a 450-nt 3'-utr element conserved among a large number of amastin mrnas is responsible for stage-specific gene regulation  <cit> , and a consensus motif uauuuuuu has also been described for the nuclear-encoded components of the cytochrome oxidase complex in t. brucei  <cit> . the cis-elements ubp1m and rbp3m characterized in this work are the best signature motifs for the rbps examined here, and they are necessary for rna-binding activities. however, the motifs were present in only a subset of experimental transcripts, indicating that several sequence elements might be involved in rna-protein recognition. therefore, our findings suggest the existence of a wide variety of rna target motifs for each factor, as was previously described for other rbps such as tia- <dig>  tiar, hur, and puf proteins  <cit> . additional motifs were also functional in tcrbp binding and we found 3'-utrs in several transcripts bearing different motifs for either tcubp <dig> or tcrbp <dig> . bibliographical reports indicate that redundancy of cis-elements constitutes a mechanism to ensure or modulate the functionality of rna-protein interaction with a given target transcript  <cit> .

motifs conserved within the group of tcrbp3-bound transcripts were also found in a number of tcubp <dig> experimental mrna targets, and vice versa, and some of these regions overlapped. for instance, hypo <dig> mrna, a library-derived target for both tcrbps, had a 3'-utr where ubp1m intersected rbp3m. this region was able to bind both proteins, similar to what was recently described for binding of the yeast puf1p and puf5p family members to a motif within the tif <dig> 3'-utr  <cit> . more generally, we have demonstrated here that both proteins might share and bind to common targets, as has been published for hur and auf <dig> proteins that bind to many common au-rich transcripts  <cit> , and yeast puf4p and mpt5p that negatively regulate a single mrna  <cit> .

results shown in figure  <dig> suggest that experimental targets for each protein, tcubp <dig> or tcrbp <dig>  could also be associated with the other protein. although these findings are consistent with the relatively non-specific binding capacity of tbubp <dig> and tbubp <dig> postulated in t. brucei  <cit> , real-time pcr experiments have provided evidence that each rbp preferentially binds a given group of transcripts . thus, the association of mrnas with tcubp <dig> or tcrbp <dig> probably depends on many dynamic factors, including:  the abundance of the transcript itself;  the combination of multiple elements the transcript bears in the 3'-utr;  the affinity of each protein for the different motifs;  the accessibility of each rbp and additional mrna binding factors; and,  the condition of the parasite at any given moment. in this regard, it has recently been reported that during nutritional stress tcubp <dig> and tcrbp <dig> re-localize in large cytoplasmic granules  <cit>  containing other rrm-type proteins and polyadenylated mrnas. interestingly, under normal conditions rbps are also present in discrete, but small, cytoplasmic granules . the composition of these mrnp granules might determine the fate of the transcripts they contain under natural conditions. further work should indicate the minimal set of rbps associated with a single transcript and will measure the stability, translation, or degradation of such transcripts.

rna-binding domains are well conserved among kinetoplastids, so the presence of the identified rna motifs in ortholog mrna targets from t. brucei and l. major was investigated. to this end, we obtained trypanosomatid transcripts that were orthologs of the experimental targets using the genedb web server , and searched for rna structural motifs. interestingly, more than 80%  of the ubp <dig> ortholog transcripts contained ubp1m and  <dig> %  of the ortholog rbp <dig> targets encompassed rbp3m , suggesting that these rrm proteins could share a similar set of mrna targets in the three trypanosomatids. functionally related groups of transcripts within the list of experimental and database targets for each protein were found. the model that emerges from our results is in line with the results of an increasing number of studies  <cit>  that suggest coordination of gene expression by combinatorial binding of rbps to different subsets of functionally related mrnas, thus defining a post-transcriptional operon that increases regulatory flexibility following biological perturbations. many of the mrnas identified in tcubp1-containing mrnp complexes encode proteins involved in general metabolic pathways. additionally, we found mrnas encoding several surface proteins, including smug mrna, a known target for tcubp <dig>  <cit> . notably, one of the sequences found matches the 3'-utr of four glycoprotein-coding genes ; all possess nearly the same sequence in their 3'-utrs and harbor ubp1m . among the tcrbp3-associated transcripts experimentally obtained, and also confirmed in databases , a large number of rpc genes were found, thus suggesting the possibility that tcrbp <dig> may regulate and coordinate ribosome biogenesis, as has been previously described for other rrm-type proteins  <cit> . as mentioned, the observations are consistent with the idea that functionally related mrnas of trypanosomes might be coordinately regulated at the post-transcriptional level by specific rbps, in agreement with the rna operon/regulon model suggested for other cells . this or other alternatives are interesting in the context of a single cell, the trypanosome, which likely makes rna metabolism the sole mechanism to regulate gene expression.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper we identified and validated target mrnas for two phylogenetically conserved rrm-containing rbps among kinetoplastids. tcubp <dig> and tcrbp <dig> can share target transcripts, although they preferentially bind given sets of mrnas. these trypanosomal target transcripts contain conserved structural elements, involved in rna-binding, in their 3'-utrs. moreover, the elements identified for tcubp <dig> or tcrbp <dig> binding were successfully used to determine novel database targets that were classified within groups of common functions. in addition, we found that trypanosome rbps can associate with more than one motif, and the combination of elements is the main factor in determination of rna-protein recognition.
