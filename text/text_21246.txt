BACKGROUND
the arabidopsis myosin gene family contains  <dig> members. the myosin xi group, which is related to unconventional myosin v  <cit> , includes  <dig> members while the myosin viii group, which is related to unconventional myosin v  <cit>  but also to myosin vi  <cit> , includes four members. both myosin groups viii and xi are specific to plants  <cit> . typically, the arabidopsis myosins contain a conserved motor domain, a number of iq domains for light-chain binding, a coiled-coil domain that is predicted to facilitate their dimerization and a specific tail to bind the cargo  <cit> . plant myosins are generally implicated in cytoplasmic streaming  <cit> , organelle movement  <cit> , cytokinesis  <cit> , plasmodesmatal functioning  <cit> , and endocytosis  <cit> .

myosin viii  was the first plant myosin to be identified and sequenced  <cit> . a specific antibody raised against a peptide corresponding to its unique tail was used to show, in both immunofluorescence and electron microscopy studies, that atm <dig> was localized to plant-specific structures such as the plasmodesmata and plasma membrane of newly formed cell walls in root cells of maize and arabidopsis  <cit> . atm <dig> has also been found in pit fields in the inner cortex cells of maize root apices, where it was predicted to be involved in fluid-phase endocytosis  <cit> . in a more recent work, the same antibody was used to show that in cells of maize root caps, atm <dig> localized around the nuclei but relocated to amyloplasts and to plasmodesmata following  <dig> min and  <dig> min of osmotic stimulus, respectively  <cit> . the latter suggests acto-myosin involvement in root osmo-sensing  <cit> . when atm <dig> was fused to gfp, its fluorescence was concentrated mostly at the developing cell plate in by <dig> cells  <cit> . the four members of myosin viii are atm <dig>  atm <dig>  myosin viiia and myosin viiib. while atm <dig> is more similar to viiia, atm <dig> is related to viiib both in sequence and expression pattern.

in this work, we followed myosin viii using gfp fusions. we show that in transgenic plants expressing gfp-atm <dig> fluorescence is differentially localized in different root cells. sensitivity to bfa also differed between root cells. when transiently expressed in n. benthamiana, gfp-atm <dig> was found in pit fields accumulating callose, and co-localized with the er. atm <dig> also co-localized with internalized fm4- <dig> and partially co-localized with the endosomal markers ara <dig>  and rarely with ara <dig> and fyve. furthermore, truncated atm <dig> inhibited the motility of associated ara <dig> labeled organelles but could be found on motile fyve labeled organelles. only large excess of atm <dig> associated with fyve labeled organelles arrested their motility. taken together our data suggest that myosin viii differentially functions in different cells and can be involved in different steps of endocytosis, bfa sensitive and insensitive pathways, er tethering and in plasmodesmatal activity.

RESULTS
transgenic plants expressing gfp-atm1
transgenic arabidopsis plants expressing gfp-atm <dig> were generated. among tens of seedlings resistant to kanamycin, only one seedling expressed detectable levels of gfp-atm <dig>  suggesting some cytotoxicity of the mutant molecule. gfp-atm <dig> was expressed and passed on to subsequent generations but no significant phenotypes or changes in cell morphology relative to wild-type  plants were observed. interestingly, fluorescence of gfp-atm <dig>  was visible in the roots but almost undetectable in the shoots and leaves.

to verify that the chimera is expressed properly, pcr was performed on dna prepared from the transgenic plants and from wt plants as a control, and compared to pcr of dna from the plasmid encoding the chimera used to generate the transgenic plants. figure 1a shows that the full length of the expected fragment  was detected in the pcr using dna from transgenic plants similar to the fragment obtained from plasmid dna. control plants were negative. western blot analysis confirmed the expression of the full-length chimera  and showed that the level of expression of the gfp-atm <dig> chimera in transgenic plants is very low compared to the expression of gfp alone in control plants . because of the lack of good anti atm <dig> antibodies in our hands, no comparison to endogenous protein's level of expression was done. confocal-microscope images of roots of the transgenic plants revealed that the chimera gfp-atm <dig> is differentially localized in different cells. while in epidermis cells at the root cap fluorescence was equally distributed all over the cell, in epidermal cells right above this region fluorescence accumulated in dots or aggregates of  <dig> Â±  <dig> nm in diameter. further up, in cells of the elongation zone, gfp-atm <dig> was preferentially positioned at transverse cell walls . this pattern of gfp-atm <dig> subcellular distribution was found in roots of 5-day-old  and 20-day-old  seedlings, including the lateral roots  of 20-day-old seedlings. when a three dimension image of figure 2b was constructed and rotated around its axis, it could be distinguished that the dots were scattered around the cells making it difficult to distinguish between membrane and cytoplasmic specific localization . in root hairs, gfp-atm <dig> also formed a pattern of dots .

differential sensitivity of atm <dig> to bfa in different root cells
unlike in several other species where bfa treatment leads to redistribution of golgi proteins to the er  <cit> , in arabidopsis root cells, bfa leads to the formation of bfa-bodies that are derived from endosomal membranes and accumulate endocytosed markers  <cit> . thus it has been shown that the bfa-sensitive process in arabidopsis is endosomal trafficking  <cit> . since myosin viii has been implicated in endocytosis  <cit>  we addressed the question of whether bfa treatment would affect the specific subcellular organization of gfp-atm <dig> in the different root cells and whether atm <dig> would be found in the bfa bodies. figure 3a, b and 3c shows that bfa treatment did not disrupt the punctate pattern of atm <dig> and no atm <dig> was found in the bfa bodies formed in these particular cells; suggesting that here, atm1's function is bfa-independent. in contrast, in cells closer to the root cap where atm <dig> was equally distributed all over the cell before bfa treatment, after bfa treatment it was found in bfa bodies . this suggests that in these cells, atm <dig> is bfa-sensitive and might be involved in endosomal trafficking at specific developmental stages. for comparison and control, transgenic seedling expressing gfp alone were treated with bfa and fm4- <dig>  in these plants gfp was diffused all over the cytoplasm of root cells where bfa bodied were detected . to check whether atm <dig> is involved in different steps of endocytosis, we used a variety of different endosomal markers.

sub-cellular localization of atm <dig> transiently expressed in n. benthamiana
when fluorescent chimeras  of atm <dig> were transiently expressed in n. benthamiana leaves using agrobacterium infiltration, fluorescence accumulated as dots  on the plasma membrane of abaxial leaf epidermal cells . to verify whether this is a general pattern of localization for myosin viii members, we checked atm <dig>  myosin viiia and myosin viiib. atm <dig> and atm <dig> gave a similar pattern of dots  while myosin viiia formed smaller dots  . myosin viiib was very similar to myosin viiia . the vast majority of atm <dig> fluorescent dots were stationary but rarely, less than 1% of the dots were motile . the family members of myosin viii exhibit different expression patterns as shown by genevestigator analysis   <cit> . while atm <dig> and myosin viiia are similarly expressed in most organs, atm <dig> and myosin viiib are more highly expressed in pollen and to a lesser extent in the stamen and root hairs . it was thus interesting to determine whether the dots formed by atm <dig> and atm <dig> overlap in n. benthamiana leaves. gfp-atm <dig> and rfp-atm <dig> were therefore co-expressed in these leaves, and both localized to the same specific spots on the plasma membrane . this suggests the existence of specific foci at the plasma membrane that are able to bind both myosins. interestingly, when the atm <dig> fluorescent chimera was co-expressed with an er marker, erd2-gfp  <cit> , the punctate labeling pattern of atm <dig> correlated with the er . the same picture was observed with atm <dig> . using aniline blue to stain callose  <cit> , atm <dig> was shown to accumulate in plasmodesmata-enriched pit fields . to extend our view on the possible involvement of atm <dig> in endocytosis the membrane dye fm4- <dig> was used to follow membrane internalization. atm <dig> was found not only at the plasma membrane, but also in the cytoplasm where it co-localized with internalized fm4- <dig> . in addition, fluorescent chimeras of atm <dig> were co-expressed with the endosomal markers ara6-gfp and gfp-ara <dig>  rab <dig> orthologs from arabidopsis  <cit> , and dsred-fyve. the fyve domain is a conserved protein motif characterized by its ability to bind with high affinity and specificity to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate p), a phosphoinositide that is highly enriched in early endosomes  <cit>  and has been shown to co-localize with ara <dig> and with internalized fm4- <dig> in plants  <cit> . it was found that while fyve and ara <dig> labeled organelles were in the cytoplasm, in less than 1% of the labeled organelles, colocalization with atm <dig> was observed . generally, the motility of fyve and ara <dig> labeled organelles was not affected by the presence of truncated atm <dig> in the same cell, probably because most of them were not colocalized . however, occasionally both motile organelles co-labeled with fyve and atm <dig> , and motionless fyve labeled bodies surrounded by excess of gfp-atm <dig> could be detected . about 80â90% of ara <dig> labeled organelles colocalized with atm <dig> at or close to the plasma membrane . importantly, while ara <dig> labeled organelles were highly motile in the absence of gfp-atm <dig> , in the presence of atm <dig>  all co-labeled organelles, became motionless and only those free from atm <dig> remained motile . the above suggests a major role for atm <dig> in the function of ara <dig> labeled endosomes and a minor role in the function of ara7/fyve labeled endosomes  <cit> .

discussion
here, we studied transgenic plants expressing a chimera of gfp fused to a truncated myosin viii â the iq-tail domain of atm <dig>  this mutant molecule, lacking the head, motor domain that bind actin but containing the neck and tail domains, is expected to bind to its cellular targets and function as dominant negative by blocking wt myosin binding. indeed, among many seedlings expressing the gene for antibiotic resistance, only one was found expressing the fluorescent chimera of myosin, at very low levels. this might be the result of a cytotoxic effect of the mutant. the fact that no detectable phenotypes were observed in the plants expressing the mutant myosin was a surprise, but might be explained by the low level of expression. in this regard, it should be mentioned that when other truncated myosins were expressed in plant cells, no significant inhibition of organellar movement was observed  <cit>  suggesting redundancy in myosin's function. in the transgenic plants, we show differential localization and function of atm <dig> in root cells. similar differential localization was shown for myosin viii in maize roots stained with anti myosin viii antibody where it was found to be distributed diffusely in root cap cells but appeared as fine spots in the distal part of the apical meristem, in cells of the inner cortex, and in the distal part of the elongation region  <cit> .

in view of its differential sensitivity to bfa in different root cells and its co-localization with different endosomal markers, we propose that atm <dig> participates in various stages of endosomes biogenesis and function. we confirm previous data that myosin viii resides at the plasma membrane and is enriched in plasmodesmata  <cit> . in addition, we confirm a previous conclusion that myosin viii is involved in endocytosis  <cit>  and participates in tethering cortical elements of the er to the plasma membrane  <cit> .

atm <dig> at the plasma membrane and endosomes
based on their findings, dieter volkmann and co-workers concluded that myosin viii may be less important for intracellular motility and more involved in the anchoring of actin filaments at cell peripheries  <cit> . they predicted another possible role for myosin viii in forming a structural support for the cortical er elements tightly underlying the plasma membrane, both outside and inside the plasmodesmata  <cit> . they also suggested that myosin viii might drive invagination of the plasma membrane during fluid-phase endocytosis  <cit> .

while atm <dig> is more or less equally expressed in all plant organs, atm <dig> show specificity to male reproductive organs . other gene families of cytoskeletal proteins show differential expression in vegetative and reproductive tissues, such as actin  <cit> , profilin  <cit>  and myosin xi . we provide evidence here that both atm <dig> and atm <dig> co-localize at specific sites on the plasma membrane when transiently expressed in n. benthamiana leaf. this is the first time that two plant myosins have been shown to co-localize at the same spots on the plasma membrane, suggesting a unique composition of the plasma membrane at these sites. the myosin viii-labeled spots on the plasma membrane might be sites where the cortical actin fibers are linked to the plasma membrane such as "focal contacts"  <cit> , sites of endocytosis  <cit> , sterol-enriched complexes  <cit>  or something else that we do not yet know about. since our myosin constructs do not contain the head domain which is the actin-binding domain, we could not use them to address the question of actin binding to the plasma membrane.

in addition, we show co-localization of atm <dig>  with the er in n. benthamiana leaves. when bdm  which is a general inhibitor of myosin atpases of eukaryotic cells, was applied to growing maize roots, alterations of the typical distribution patterns of myosin viii, actin filaments and cortical er elements associated with plasmodesmata and pit fields were observed  <cit> . nevertheless, as shown here, the expressed gfp-atm <dig> which is a mutant molecule lacking the head, actin binding domain, did not disrupt the er network. this suggests that myosin viii is necessary but not essential for anchoring the cortical er to the plasma membrane  <cit>  and that other proteins with overlapping functions are there. since er spans the plasmodesmata  <cit>  it further suggests close relationships between atm <dig> and the er. plasmodesmatal myosin viii was postulated to be involved in regulating conductivity by the force it can generate to control the spacing between desmotubules and plasma membrane  <cit> . our data suggest that the cross talk between er and myosin viii is not limited to plasmodesmata because colocalization was observed at the outer membrane of epidermal cells. two models have been proposed for the role of myosin v in er localization and movement in yeast and animal cells; in model-a myosin v actively transport er tubules, while in model-b myosin v plays a role in tethering er to the cell surface  <cit> . the prediction is that in plants, myosin xi plays the role of model-a while myosin viii the role of model-b.

in root hairs  gfp-atm <dig> formed punctuate pattern along the cell. the clear zone of root hairs tip is rich in membrane recycling activity and organelles marked by the endosomal marker fyve  <cit> . myosin xi was also found in the clear zone of pollen tubes  <cit> . the presence of atm <dig> in the clear zone of elongating root hairs should be carefully analyzed.

when atm <dig> was co-expressed with different endosomal markers, partial co-localization was found with ara <dig>  and rarely with ara <dig> and fyve. endosomes in mammalian cells are categorized into four classes; early endosomes, late endosomes, recycling endosomes and lysosomes  <cit> . in plants there is no similar classification, and the functional differences between endosomes is not clear. the rab <dig> small gtpases typically regulate early endosomes  <cit>  and ara <dig> and ara <dig>  which are plant rab <dig> orthologs, localize to different and partially overlapping sub-populations of endosomes  <cit> . while ara <dig> co-localized with snare proteins characteristic of the pre-vacuolar compartment , ara <dig> did not  <cit> . this suggested that ara <dig> labels an earlier endosomal compartment  <cit> . indeed it has been shown that in plants, the routes of endocytosis and vacuolar transport merge at the pvc  <cit> . however, when ara <dig> was co-expressed with other pvc markers â ps1-gfp  <cit>  or atpep12p:ha  <cit> , it was also detected in the pvc. in our working system, atm <dig> was mainly detected at the plasma membrane in a punctate pattern; however, it was also observed in the cytoplasm, albeit rarely. the dots of cytoplasmic gfp-atm <dig> were co-localized with internalized fm4- <dig> and rarely with the markers fyve and ara <dig>  co-localization of atm <dig> with ara <dig> was pronounced and seemed to be at the plasma membrane. indeed it was previously indicated that gfp-ara <dig> resides on the plasma membrane and also on the er  <cit>  whereas ara <dig> and rha <dig> are different  <cit> . by showing preference of atm <dig> to ara <dig> labeled endosomes and by demonstrating that each ara <dig> labeled organelle loose its motility when associated with truncated atm <dig> while fyve labeled organelles can remain mobile although associated with atm <dig> and only large excess of truncated atm <dig> could arrest their motility, we provide another evidence for the presence of different subpopulation of endosomes  <cit> . our data suggests that atm <dig> is more crucial for the motility of ara <dig> containing endosomes and plays only a minor role, if at all, in the function of fyve/ara <dig> containing endosomes. importantly, the observation that ara6-gfp partially co-labeled bfa-induced structures in roots  <cit>  is in agreement with our findings of the association of atm <dig> with ara6-gfp on the one hand, and with bfa bodies in specific root cells on the other hand.

the partial localization of atm <dig> to different vesicles marked by ara <dig>  ara <dig> or fyve and to bfa bodies suggests that it has a role in the motility of endosomes at different stages of maturation and in endosomal recycling to the plasma membrane  <cit> . a dual role in endocytosis, both at the plasma membrane and in endosomal motility, has been suggested for myosin vi  <cit> , which is phylogenetically close to myosin viii  <cit> . myosin vi is implicated in both the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles at the plasma membrane and the movement of nascent uncoated vesicles from the actin-rich cell periphery to the early endosome in animal cells  <cit> . interestingly, myosin vi was found to move toward actin's minus end  <cit>  in a processive manner  <cit> . the latter functions are still not known for myosin viii.

possible differential roles for myosin viii in different root cells
plant roots are very sophisticated sensors that are able to perceive various different environmental and soil cues such as gravitation force, touch, water potential and osmolarity. gravity-sensing is done by specialized cells that are located within the columella root cap. the signal is perceived by specialized cells, statocytes, containing specific amyloplasts, statoliths that sediment in these cells according to the gravitation force  <cit> . the gravity perceived signal is transmitted from the columela cells by a mobile auxin signal to the cells at the elongation zone  <cit> . the actin meshwork is believed to be the cellular structure that sedimenting amyloplasts pass through or interact with to trigger the downstream signaling events leading to root orientation  <cit> . there is also accumulating evidence that the transport of auxin, is regulated by actin  <cit> . thus the differential localization of atm <dig> in root cap and elongating cells might reflect the different roles that it plays as part of the actin cytoskeleton during signaling perception. we did not detected particular phenotypes related to gravitropism in the gfp-atm <dig>  plants. although atm <dig> seems to have polarized localization to transverse walls in cells at the elongation zone its role in the polarized accumulation of auxin transporters  <cit>  is still to be determined. it was also shown that touch stimulation but not gravity-stimulation led to transient increases in ca2+ ions in root cells  <cit>  and that the increase induced in the cap cells was larger and longer-lived than in cells in the meristematic or elongation zone  <cit> . the touch induced calmodulin like protein  <dig>   <cit>  was found by us to interact with the iq domains of atm <dig> in a calcium regulated manner  <cit> . thus atm <dig> can be involved in differential touch responses in the different root cells, being regulated by tch <dig> as a light chain. atm <dig> was also shown to be responsive to osmo-signals specifically in root-cap cells where it was found to be recruited to plastids surfaces following stimulation  <cit> . the dotted pattern seen in some of the root cells was identified by an anti myosin viii antibody in maize roots <cit>  as plasmodesmata enriched pit fields. using a specific stain for callose we confirmed the presence of atm <dig> in pit fields of n. benthamiana leaves, however, in the transgenic plants, atm <dig> fluorescent dots are scattered all over the cell. thus we don't know precisely, what is the different function that atm <dig> plays in these particular cells. also, not all cells in the "belt" of cells showing dotted pattern of gfp-atm <dig> were dotted, the reason might be the absence of synchronization in their developmental stage.

CONCLUSIONS
while a truncated gfp fusion of atm <dig> lacking the head domain can be expressed by plants that remain normal, it was found to be a useful probe for atm1's behavior in root cells. using these plants it is shown here, in live cells, that atm <dig> changes its localization in root epidermal cells as they develop. this change in localization is accompanied by a change in sensitivity to bfa, indicating on a functional modification. further this work provide evidence using microscopy of live cells, that myosin viii is preferentially involved in the function of ara <dig> associated endosomes and is localized to er and pit fields rich in plasmodesmata.
