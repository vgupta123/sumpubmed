BACKGROUND
investigations of the human mt genome are in the focus of biological and medical scientific disciplines. compared to nuclear dna , mitochondrial dna  is more vulnerable to oxidative damage and undergoes a higher rate of mutation  <cit> . because of these features the analysis of the mt genome has become a proven tool in population genetics. a multi-copy genome without recombination which accumulates mutations allows for the establishment of phylogenetic trees  <cit> . it was the information from the highly variable mitochondrial control region  that lifted the secret of human evolution starting in africa about  <dig> years ago and gave an insight in human migration all over the world within the past  <dig> years  <cit> . sequences of full mt genomes are necessary to decipher yet not defined haplotypes and assign them to their phylogeographic environment.

mitochondrial dna mutations in the coding region  have been associated with several pathologies  <cit>  including cancer  <cit> . during oxidative phosphorylation  mitochondria produce reactive oxidative species  that potentially induce dna mutations. such an initial mutation is heteroplasmic with the mutated variant constituting a minority  <cit> . in the course of several replications the heteroplasmic mutation may become dominant leading to cancer  <cit> . this theory is based on the results of several investigations on cancer tissues  <cit> . unfortunately, numerous articles addressing that issue are erroneous as reviewed in  <cit> . on the one hand it is the lack of phylogenetic knowledge and the ambiguous mtdna alignment that led to false conclusions of mtdna mutations to be tumor-specific rather than evolutionary caused. on the other hand, laboratory-, sequencing-, and analysis errors led to wrong base-calls  <cit> . hence, flawed data hamper a precise interpretation of the conjunction between mtdna mutations and the complex process of tumor development.

for forensic as well as for phylogenetic purposes we have already successfully established evaluated sequencing strategies that proved to be useful in a number of investigations where precise base-calling was necessary for the cr  <cit> , however such stringency is lacking for the whole mt genome. the published protocols vary concerning the number and sizes of pcr products, the chemistry employed, and the number of sequencing primers  <cit> . one review reports the use of  <dig> sets of unique sequencing primers to completely cover the mt genome, while another protocol provides  <dig> sequencing primers for the codr and  <dig> additional primers for the cr  <cit> . there, sequencing is performed on  <dig> amplicons that cover the whole mt genome in an overlapping manner  <cit> . in a recent protocol  <cit>  the amplification of the entire mt genome was conducted with only two overlapping amplicons, followed by  <dig> upstream and downstream sequencing reactions. whereas amplicon sizes must be kept short for forensic samples for reasons of limited dna quality and quantity, a reduction of the necessary amplicons is desirable for other applications, where usually fresh dna is obtained. this simplifies the laboratory work and minimizes potential amplicon mix-up  <cit> . independent of the amplification strategy high sequence quality is required to achieve reliable base-calling.

we addressed this issue by presenting a set of  <dig> carefully selected sequencing primers that are embedded in a reliable and fail-safe sequencing strategy. the following criteria were applied to guide the development.  each nucleotide reported in the consensus sequence should derive from at least two independent sequencing reactions using different primers  to avoid the reporting of phantom mutations and other ambiguous base-callings.  we envision a minimum number of pcr products to reduce the chance for amplicon mix-up during the  set-up of sequencing reactions and  we selected primers that produce sequences with an optimal signal-to-noise ratio to enable unequivocal assignment of point and length heteroplasmy.

RESULTS
methodical procedure
the complete mtdna was amplified using  <dig> overlapping fragments each about  <dig>  kb in length with primers published in  <cit> . fragment a ranges within nucleotide positions  <dig> and  <dig>  fragment b between  <dig> and  <dig> comprising the cr .

the sensitivity of the amplification reaction was elicited with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> molecules of quantified mtdna  <cit> . pcr yield and specificity were visualized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . even though the density of the banding pattern varied significantly , the sequence analysis of all fragments resulted in comparably clear data . also the amount of  <dig> mtdna genomic equivalents  that roughly corresponds to the mtdna content of a single lymphocyte  proved sufficient for reliable results . pcr products showed light smear on the polyacrylamide gel , especially with increasing template amount. however, we did not observe negative effects on the quality of the sequencing results . no evidence of contamination was observed, neither in the non-template controls nor during evaluation of the individual mtdna haplotypes. both extraction blanks and pcr negative controls were free of signal. the mtdna of two tissues  was extracted, amplified and sequenced from each person at different times and corresponding haplotypes gave a match after comparison .

amplicons were purified according to two different protocols. we compared an enzymatic digestion method with a filtration method . we did not observe significant differences with respect to the dna amount after purification except for one sample. there, the banding signal of the exosap-it purified product was less dense as compared to the filtrated one. however, despite of the different banding intensities  we did not observe relevant changes in sequencing quality between the electropherograms . the filtration method has the appealing advantage that it is less expensive for pcr product purification of few samples present in large volumes . one microcon column is needed for each sample irrespective of the dna volume to be added, whereas the required amount of exosap-it is required to be proportional to the volume of dna .

we established a set of  <dig> sequencing primers that lead to full double-sequence coverage of the complete mtdna codr . primer sequences were partly taken from  <cit>  and  as well as designed inhouse  <cit> . in combination with sequences obtained from the cr  <cit>  this resulted in high-quality sequence information for the whole mtdna genome. such a strategy makes sense, as full mt genome sequencing is usually carried out on selected samples that have earlier been analyzed within the cr. sequencing was performed on the basis of the big dye terminator ready reactions kit protocol . the quality of the primers was generally stable despite of multiple freezing/thawing cycles of the stock primer plate. for  <dig> primers  out of  <dig> the signal-to-noise ratio decreased after the fifth freezing/thawing cycle. an example of the general quality of the sequences is shown in figure  <dig>  the sequence is displayed by two primers in both directions confirming point heteroplasmy of the variants a and g at position  <dig> within the nadh dehydrogenase  gene.

sequence electropherograms did not differ substantially in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio as well as with respect to the relative peak heights when comparing the tested mtdna template amounts. although a relative increase of the fluorescence signal in the raw data was detected , the quality of the sequence electropherograms were comparable . in this study we tested template mtdna amounts between  <dig> and  <dig> ges that turned out to cover an appropriate template amount range for long pcr fragments.

data analysis and quality assurance
upon analysis of the raw data the sequences were aligned and the base-calls reviewed twice by two independent scientists, such as has been found invaluable for cr analysis  <cit> . consensus sequences were aligned and compared to the revised cambridge reference sequence   <cit>  following nomenclature guidelines for mtdna typing  <cit> . in an independent analysis the two consensus sequences underwent comparison by means of a dedicated in-house software  <cit> . this concept enabled full electronic data handling minimizing the risk to introduce clerical errors.

assignment of the samples to their specific haplogroups
we present the complete mtdna sequences of  <dig> clinical samples from  <dig> patients with respect to the phylogeny  <cit>   . these patients were classified as typical west-eurasian lineages as members of haplogroups w1d, t2b, v <dig>  h <dig>  and h15b  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig> , the mtdna sequences generated from the primary cancerous tissue and the peripheral blood cells were identical in all  <dig> patients.

discussion
we present a reliable laboratory strategy for the amplification and sequence analysis of the full mt genome that meets a high quality demand. the method is conceived for samples that include an adequate amount and quality of dna, such as found in fresh clinical and forensic samples and can be conducted by any laboratory in the molecular field without the requirement for automated liquid handling devices. the complexity of the laboratory concept is low, so that handling errors and risk of sample mix-up and contamination are minimized.

effects of primer-storage on sequencing quality
it has been shown in this study that the sequence performance of the majority of primers was not affected by different storage conditions. only  <dig> primers  suffered from a treatment of more than  <dig> freezing/thawing cycles. temperature changes caused a diminished function visualized by a disadvantageous signal-to-noise ratio depicted in the electropherogram. the ability to correctly identify point heteroplasmy strongly depends on the quality of the overall signal height and the signal-to-noise ratio. consequently, an apparent improvement of the storing conditions would be the generation of stock plates including less primer volume sufficient for about  <dig> sequencing reactions. alternatively, sequencing primers could be kept in a low tris buffer at 4°c.

applications in various fields
recent research has been addressing the role of mitochondria and the mtdna in aging and cancer as mitochondria participate in fundamental processes of the cellular metabolism  <cit> . the mitochondrial theory of aging implies that tissue function sustains until the number of cells declines below a threshold. the time range required to reach this threshold is related to the rate at which mitochondrial and mtdna damage accumulates. if the mitochondrial ros production rate increases, the rate of cell loss will also increase, resulting in early tissue failure and age-related disease.

not only aging processes but also carcinogenesis have been linked to mutation based mitochondrial dysfunction since a general feature of tumor biology is the impaired energy metabolism  <cit> . for those investigations addressing aging and tumor biology, mitochondrial genes encoded in the nucleus and in the mitochondrial dna are being analyzed. genes encoded in the mitochondrial dna can be systematically targeted with this evaluated sequencing strategy.

furthermore, it can be helpful for population genetic and forensic applications where further information to the cr is required. in the forensic context this is particularly relevant for the few cr haplotypes that are shared more commonly within a population. in the west eurasian population this is the case for the cr haplotypes 16519c 263g  <dig> c and 263g  <dig> c, which occur at frequencies of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively  <cit> . when such haplotypes are observed in a forensic case between suspect and crime scene samples one needs to consider the possibility that the sequences are identical by state and not by descent. especially, as it is known that these haplotypes occur in more haplogroup backgrounds, such as h <dig>  h2a, h <dig>  h <dig>  h <dig>  h13a <dig>  hv, r <dig> and the great bulk of yet unidentified sub-h lineages  <cit> . to increase the information content of such haplotypes we have earlier introduced a screening method based on single-base-extension reactions that target informative snps  in the codr  <cit> . such screening methods are a valuable supplement to standard mtdna sequencing as they generally increase the discrimination power and indicate the hg-affiliation of an mtdna haplotype  <cit> . the logical continuation of this strategy would be the analysis of entire mt genomes in forensic casework for achieving maximum discrimination power. the current sequencing technology allows that only for relatively high sample qualities, but it is a first step towards mt genome sequencing in forensics.

in the population genetic field an accurate deciphering of the human mitochondrial phylogeny can only be conducted on the basis of full mt genomes. as a general approach full genome mtdna sequencing is carried out on a defined selection of cr sequences as evidenced by recent examples  <cit> .

meaning of obtaining high quality sequences
the focus of this strategy lies on applications where secure base-calling and high quality sequence data are mandatory for interpretation. it is well known that mitochondrial mutations associated to disease such as mitochondrial encephalomyopathies occur in heteroplasmic status and that the severity and the progression of the syndrome depend on a threshold above which the mutant triggers the pathological pathway  <cit> . the contribution of mtdna mutations to carcinogenesis underlies the same assumption. it appears evident that particular mitochondrial defects with functional consequences exhibit an advantage in tumor development only if a certain threshold of mutated mtdna populations is achieved. all the more it is important to pinpoint the relative quantity of these heteroplasmic mutations to estimate functional consequences of the genes involved. moreover, good sequencing quality is the prerequisite to distinguish early stage point heteroplasmy from signal background which might be an issue in early stage cancer detection  <cit> .

the occurrence and the frequency of mtdna control region  point heteroplasmy is an important issue in forensic case work  <cit>  as the detection of point heteroplasmy, especially at low level, increases the power of discrimination between sequences  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the codr sequencing method described herein is an optimized protocol that can also be applied in laboratories that do not have automated processes available. the overall aim, namely the achievement of a secure base-calling method was accomplished by the assortment of primers that allow for full double-stranded sequence coverage of the whole mtdna genome . particular care was taken on the selection of the primers based on low background signal that is crucial for the unambiguous assessment of length and point heteroplasmy. moreover, we kept the complexity of the laboratory process as low as possible. this was achieved by a 96- well based pipetting format for cycle sequencing set-up using only two pcr amplicons per sample which reduces the chances of contamination, handling error and sample mix-up.
