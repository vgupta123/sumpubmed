BACKGROUND
intracellular protein aggregates form when misfolded proteins accumulate in cells because of malfunctioning or overloading of either the quality control pathways that recognize and route defective proteins for degradation or the elements of the actual degradative pathway  <cit> . aggregates distribute randomly throughout the cell and can be associated with pathogenic changes; for example, they may block microtubule-based transport  <cit>  or sequester components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system  <cit> .

one of the cellular responses to potentially pathogenic aggregates of misfolded proteins is their dynein-mediated retrograde transport along microtubules to the centrosome  <cit>  where they are enriched together with elements of the protein-folding and degradation machinery in pericentriolar structures, called aggresomes  <cit> .

aggresomes may protect cells by sequestering harmful protein aggregates and enhancing their degradation either by concentrating them together with proteasome subunits or by triggering their uptake into autophagosomes and delivery to lysosomes  <cit> . experimentally induced aggresomes stirred general interest, because they are similar in composition and morphology to inclusion bodies found in brains of patients who died of neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> .

the most studied protein that accumulates in aggresomes is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator . similar to some other integral membrane proteins that have large hydrophobic regions  <cit> , over-expressed cftr is inefficiently processed  <cit> . this is even more pronounced for a prevalent mutation in cystic fibrosis patients, the Δf508-cftr deletion mutant, which is degraded by the proteasome  <cit> . when the degradation of cftr is inhibited, cftr accumulates in pericentrosomal aggresomes  <cit> . the retrograde transport of cftr and other misfolded proteins depends on the integrity of the microtubule cytoskeleton and the association of dynein with the cargo-binding dynactin complex  <cit> .

linker proteins that associate with dynein, organelles, and microtubules facilitate the loading of cargos for retrograde transport and contribute to the establishment and active maintenance of the juxtanuclear localization of organelles  <cit> , and thus they may play a role in the formation of aggresomes. hook-related proteins were proposed to function as linker proteins  <cit> . hook proteins are composed of a conserved n-terminal domain, a central coiled-coil, and a more divergent c-terminal domain that has been implicated in the binding of each of the hook proteins to a different class of organelles  <cit> .

data from several studies suggested that hook proteins may modulate microtubule based transport. the first identified member of the hook family, drosophila hook, was originally discovered based on a defect in endocytic trafficking  <cit> . the characterization of a c. elegans homolog, zyg- <dig>  revealed a function in binding and linking centrosomes to nuclei through the microtubule cytoskeleton  <cit> . we recently found that mammalian hook <dig> also localizes to centrosomes, in this case through a direct interaction with centriolin  <cit> . in addition, altering hook <dig> levels or function led to the accumulation of both endogenous and overexpressed proteins at the centrosome, raising the possibility that hook <dig> may influence aggresome formation.

here, we are using mutant cftr, which is well-known to accumulate in aggresomes  <cit> , to examine whether hook <dig> contributed to the accumulation of misfolded proteins around the centrosome. we found that altering hook <dig> activity by overexpressing hook <dig> or using dominant-negative hook <dig> proteins changed the distribution of aggresome constituents. we have considered the possibility that hook <dig> induced changes in the activities of the protein degradation pathway, such as ubiquitination, however we found no evidence for hook2-induced biochemical changes in cftr. therefore, we propose a model wherein hook <dig> influences aggresome formation by interfering with the functioning of the centrosome in the coordination of vectorial intracellular transport.

RESULTS
hook <dig> co-localizes with aggresomes at the centrosome
endogenous and overexpressed hook <dig> localizes to the centrosome, as we previously showed by colocalization with the centrosomal markers ninein and gamma-tubulin, at the center of the radial microtubule array  <cit> . the juxtanuclear localization of over-expressed hook2-constructs resembled the centrosomal distribution of endogenous hook <dig> in an accentuated form . centrosomal accumulation of hook <dig> gradually increased upon continued expression over  <dig> days with only a modest change in the number of cells with centrosomally localized hook <dig> . we have previously shown that centrosomal accumulation of hook <dig> did not disrupt the microtubule network or the golgi complex  <cit> , indicating that hook <dig> overexpression did not disrupt the structural integrity of cells.

because overexpressed hook <dig> accumulated around the centrosome, we wondered whether hook <dig> and components of aggresomes co-localized. to induce aggresomes experimentally, the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin  <cit>  was applied to cells that co-expressed Δf508-cftr and hook <dig>  after  <dig> h of lactacystin treatment, aggregates of cftr co-localized with hook <dig> in juxtanuclear aggresomes .

over-expressed hook <dig> promotes the juxtanuclear accumulation of aggresome components
hook <dig> not only co-localized with lactacystin-induced and cftr-containing aggresomes, but also induced aggresome formation in the absence of proteasome inhibitors and cftr, as indicated by the juxtanuclear accumulation of endogenous hsc <dig>  ubiquitin, and the 20s component of the proteasome in hook <dig> transfected cells .

dynein-mediated transport of cargo to aggresomes is necessary for their formation, but in this process the dynein motor also becomes concentrated within aggresomes  <cit> . consistent with these results, we observed that aggresomes induced by hook <dig> were enriched in dynein, even in the absence of lactacystin. this accumulation was visible already at the earliest stages in hook2-induced aggresome formation when little hook <dig> had accumulated  and became more pronounced as the amount of centrosomal hook <dig> accumulation increased .

moderately overexpressed cftr is found throughout the secretory system including the er and on the plasma membrane . with increased expression or upon addition of proteasome inhibitors, misfolded cftr forms multiple aggregates that tend to localize close to the nucleus but are found throughout the cell  and over time concentrates in compact juxtanuclear aggresomes . time lapse imaging has previously captured these three types of distributions as stages along the pathway of aggresome formation  <cit> . after  <dig> hrs of lactacystin treatment, cftr is found in aggregates in 70% of cells, but only in 14% of these it has accumulated yet in a single prominent aggresome . while the percentage of cells with aggregates modestly increased to 84% after 12hrs, the incidence of aggresomes more than doubled to 34%.

co-expression with hook <dig> caused a dramatic increase in the frequency of Δf508-cftr aggresomes at each time point. the hook2-induced increase of cftr in aggresomes was most obvious without treatment with lactacystin . hook <dig> coexpression did not result in an increase in the percentage of cells with aggregated cftr after  <dig> or  <dig> hrs in the presence of lactacystin. however, at every time point, the frequency of aggresomes at least doubled upon hook <dig> coexpression.

the effect of hook <dig> on the induction of aggresomes without lactacystin treatment was even more pronounced when the distribution of Δf508-cftr was considered separately in cells with hook <dig> accumulation at the centrosome and in cells with diffuse hook2: 54% of cells with centrosomal hook <dig> had Δf508-cftr-positive aggresomes compared to only 3% of cells with a diffuse hook <dig> distribution . therefore, centrosomally localized hook <dig> promotes aggresome formation.

we also examined the effect of cftr co-expression on the distribution of hook <dig>  if the effect of hook <dig> on cftr accumulation in aggresomes is only due to an unspecific increase in the level of misfolded proteins, then misfolded cftr should have a reciprocal effect on hook <dig>  however, in contrast to the dramatic effect of hook <dig> on Δf508-cftr localization, Δf508-cftr had no effect on hook <dig> localization. hook <dig> juxtanuclear aggregates were seen in the same percentage of cells with and without Δf508-cftr . inhibition of proteasome activity increased the number of cells with juxtanuclear hook <dig> accumulation, but Δf508-cftr had no effect on hook <dig> distribution. moreover, 100% of Δf508-cftr aggresomes were also enriched in hook <dig>  by contrast, only 29% of the cells with diffusely distributed Δf508-cftr contained hook2-positive type iv aggresomes . the finding that hook <dig> distribution at the centrosome is not influenced by the level of misfolded and aggregated Δf508-cftr argues against hook <dig> simply accumulating in aggresomes as misfolded proteins. taken together, these date indicate that centrosomally located hook <dig> promotes aggresome formation.

interference with hook <dig> function alters cftr aggresome formation
to further test a possible role for hook <dig> in aggresome formation, we attempted different approaches to interfere with hook <dig> function. because so far we have not been successful in significantly knocking down hook <dig> levels by rnai, we expressed hook <dig> truncations that are predicted to act as dominant negatives. this approach has previously been successful in drosophila where phenotypes very similar to those of the hook <dig> null allele resulted from the expression of dhook proteins that were truncated at their n- or c-termini but retained the coiled-coil dimerization domain  <cit> .

thus, we tested whether corresponding hook <dig> truncation mutants altered aggresome formation. we counted the number of cells with distinct cftr distributions in vero cells  or hek <dig> cells  that expressed Δf508-cftr for  <dig> hours together with various hook <dig> constructs. especially Δc-hook <dig>  which lacks the centriolin binding site of hook <dig>  <cit> , but retains its dimerization domain, was expected to interfere with the function of the endogenous hook <dig> protein.

in the absence of lactacystin, cftr distribution was mildly altered by co-expression of Δc-hook2: it reduced the fraction of cells with cftr aggresomes to 1% from 3% observed with cftr alone, and increased the fraction of cells with aggregated cftr from 5% to 9%. by contrast, under these conditions co-expression of full-length hook <dig> increased the fraction of cells with cftr in aggresomes from 3% to 24%. this effect is specific, as co-expression of hook <dig> or the hook chimeras  <dig> and  <dig>  which contain mostly hook <dig> sequences, did not increase cftr aggregation.

the presence of lactacystin  caused a large increase in the percentage of cells with cftr aggregates and aggresomes  <cit> . however, even under these conditions hook <dig> proteins retained their effect on aggresome formation. compared to cftr-only transfected cells, cotransfection with wild-type hook <dig> doubled the fraction of cells with aggresomes and made them as frequent as cells with aggregates. by contrast, the presence of the dominant negative Δc-hook <dig> caused a reduction in the percentage of cells with perinuclear aggregates and aggresomes consistent with hook <dig> playing a role in their formation.

n-terminally truncated hook <dig> had an effect similar to that of Δc-hook <dig>  in the presence of lactacystin, co-expression of Δn-hook <dig> reduced by ~50% the percentage of cells with Δf508-cftr in aggresomes compared to cftr-only transfected cells. similar results were obtained in five separate experiments in vero cells  as well as hek <dig> cells . the interpretation of these results is complicated by our previous finding that Δn-hook <dig> can recruit centrosomal proteins such as ninein and thus may indirectly interfere with retrograde transport  <cit> . importantly, no inhibitory effect on aggresome formation was observed upon co-expression of hook <dig> . on the contrary, hook <dig> over-expression enhanced the effect of lactacystin and caused a further increase in aggresomes; this is likely due to an unspecific effect, since hook <dig> itself accumulates at centrosomes when proteasome activity is inhibited . consistent with this notion, co-expression of c-terminally truncated hook <dig> or hook <dig> did not result in a reduction in aggresomes , further supporting a specific function for hook <dig> in aggresome formation.

in an attempt to pinpoint a specific domain in hook <dig> responsible for its effect on aggresome formation, we tested several chimeras between hook <dig> and hook <dig>  we found that chimeras of hook <dig> and the c- or the n-terminus of hook <dig> enhanced aggresome formation in the absence of lactacystin . interestingly, this parallels our previous findings with these chimeras showing that domains partially redundant between hook <dig> and hook <dig> contribute to centrosomal localization of hook <dig>  <cit> .

hook <dig> changes cftr distribution without an obvious biochemical change
expression of hook <dig> could affect aggresome formation by altering biochemical properties of cftr that cause it to aggregate or by changing the degree to which aggregated cftr is transported to aggresomes. to distinguish between these possibilities, first we investigated whether hook <dig> coexpression changed the biochemical properties of cftr.

lactacystin induced a shift to an insoluble high-molecular weight ubiquitinated form of Δf508-cftr . extraction of cells also indicated that the accumulating high molecular form of cftr was insoluble in 1% tritonx- <dig> and a small fraction was insoluble even in 1% sds . hook <dig> co-expression in the absence of lactacystin did not significantly change either the electrophoretic mobility pattern of cftr  or its solubility , suggesting that effects of hook <dig> on cftr distribution are more likely due to an alteration in the transport of cftr aggregates to aggresomes.

in addition, we also explored whether co-expression of hook <dig> truncations modified cftr. immunoblots of triton x- <dig> extracts from cells co-expressing Δf508-cftr and either Δn-hook <dig> or Δc-hook <dig> showed that these dominant-negative constructs did not alter the electrophoretic mobility pattern of Δf508-cftr or its solubility, whether lactacystin was present or not . furthermore, we speculated that changes in aggresome formation might be due to an inhibition of proteasome-mediated degradation of cftr by over-expressed hook proteins. therefore we compared levels of wild-type cftr or Δf508-cftr proteins after co-transfection with hook <dig> or hook truncation mutants and various controls in the absence of lactacystin . equivalent loading was assured by loading  <dig> μg total protein per lane. no change in steady-state cftr protein levels was observed. these results indicated that the effect of hook <dig> truncation proteins on the subcellular distribution of Δf508-cftr was not due to changes in its biochemical properties or a change in proteasome activity.

discussion
hook proteins constitute a family of coiled-coil proteins that have been implicated in the positioning of a variety of organelles  <cit> . in this study we present experiments suggesting that hook <dig> may function in the positioning or formation of aggresomes, pericentriolar accumulations of misfolded proteins, proteasomes and chaperones. hook <dig> expression enhanced the recruitment of aggresome components to the centrosome, in addition to the molecular motor dynein which previously had been shown to accumulate in aggresomes and is necessary for their formation  <cit> . furthermore, the accumulation of cftr into aggresomes was inhibited by a hook <dig> c-terminal truncation that is modelled after a dominant-negative form of the drosophila hook protein  <cit>  and lacks the centriolin binding region of hook <dig>  <cit> . expression of truncation mutants or full-length hook <dig> also altered the distribution of the centrosomal proteins pcm- <dig> and ninein  <cit> , indicating that the effect of hook <dig> on aggresome formation may result from its primary role in regulating the activities of the centrosome.

a first clue to a possible function of hook <dig> in aggresome formation comes from its subcellular localization at the centrosome. pericentrosomal accumulation in aggresomes has been observed for many overexpressed proteins  <cit> , but several of our findings argue for hook <dig> playing a more active role than just being a misfolded substrate for aggresome formation. importantly, centrosomal localization did not depend on overexpression-induced misfolding, but was also observed for endogenous hook <dig>  <cit> . in addition, dominant-negative hook <dig> proteins reduced the accumulation of co-expressed Δf508-cftr in aggresomes whereas wild-type hook <dig> enhanced it. this is unlikely to be due to the co-aggregation of misfolded hook <dig> and cftr proteins, because aggregation is a specific process; even if two misfolded proteins are co-expressed they accumulate in separate aggregates  <cit> .

a mechanism by which hook <dig> might enhance the formation of cftr containing aggresomes is through the inhibition of proteasome activity by overexpressed hook <dig>  as had been observed for some misfolded proteins  <cit> . however, for hook <dig>  we do not consider this as a likely explanation for the following reasons: first, even when proteasome activity was inhibited by lactacystin, hook <dig> further enhanced aggresome formation compared to lactacystin on its own , indicating that hook <dig> acts through a mechanism distinct from proteasome inhibition. second, overexpressed c- and n-terminal truncations of hook <dig> which would be more likely to be misfolded than the wild-type protein and thus expected to promote aggresome formation, actually had the opposite effect and inhibited aggresome formation . third, whereas inhibition of proteasome activity resulted in a shift to a ubiquitinated high-molecular form and increased levels of cftr , no such changes were observed for Δf508-cftr after co-expression with wild-type or mutant forms of hook <dig> . forth, if hook <dig> enhanced cftr aggresomes by inhibiting the limited proteasome capacity in cells, then misfolded cftr should have the reciprocal effect on hook <dig>  which was not observed . together, these data argue against hook <dig> enhancing aggresome formation solely by acting as a misfolded substrate for aggresomes.

instead, hook <dig> may act on the dynein-mediated retrograde transport of aggresome components. aggresome formation depends on retrograde transport of misfolded protein aggregates and other aggresome components by cytoplasmic dynein, since nocadozole-induced depolymerization and dynamitin expression interfere with aggresome formation  <cit> . as a consequence of changes in microtubule dependent transport, dynein itself can accumulate in aggresomes . thus, the inhibitory effect of truncated hook <dig> proteins on aggresome formation may, at least in part, reflect their disruptive effects on the radial array of microtubules  <cit> .

support for a model in which hook <dig> participates in the dynein-mediated retrograde transport of aggresome components comes from observations of its distant c. elegans homolog zyg- <dig>  in early c. elegans embryos, zyg- <dig> is necessary for the positioning of centrosomes close to nuclei  <cit> , a process that requires the recruitment of dynein and the dynein-associated proteins lis- <dig> and arp- <dig> to the nuclear membrane  <cit> . two-hybrid analysis has suggested a direct interaction between zyg- <dig> and the dynein light intermediate subunit  <cit> . however, our attempts to demonstrate a direct interaction between hook <dig> and cytoplasmic dynein have not been successful and we did not notice significant co-localization of hook <dig> with peripheral cftr aggregates. alternatively, hook proteins may indirectly participate in retrograde transport by functioning as transient linker proteins or attachment factors during the loading of cargo onto the dynein/dynactin complex  <cit> . such linker proteins may also contribute to the anchoring and stabilization of microtubules  <cit> , functions traditionally attributed to centrosomes. consistent with such a role of centrosomal hook <dig>  dominant-negative hook <dig> constructs interfered with the regrowth of microtubules after their nocodazole-induced depolymerization  <cit> . in this context, it is also interesting to notice that the two hook2/ <dig> chimeras that promoted aggresome formation in the absence of lactacystin  were previously found to localize to centrosomes  <cit> .

a possible function of hook <dig> in modulating the retrograde transport of non-membranous protein particles is in line with observations that implicated other members of the hook family in modulating the movement and anchoring of organelles. interference with hook <dig> function causes the dispersal of the golgi complex  <cit> , similar to the effect of overexpression of the dynamitin subunit of the dynein/dynactin complex  <cit> . furthermore, hook <dig> is abundant in differentiating murine spermatids where it localizes to the ends of the microtubule manchette at the time of flagellar development. a deletion in the hook <dig> gene underlies the mouse mutation abnormal spermatozoon head shape . azh males have reduced fertility, a phenotype that correlates with malpositioning of the manchette, abnormal shaping of the spermatid nucleus, and fragile sperm tails  <cit> . the displacement of the manchette, a spermatid-specific microtubule array in azh mice  <cit>  is consistent with an involvement of hook <dig> in the anchoring of microtubules.

these observations in azh mutant mice lacking hook <dig> and our finding that hook <dig> localizes to centrosomes, at least in part through a direct interaction with centriolin  <cit> , suggest an alternative model in which the effects of hook proteins on transport are mediated through directly altering the functioning of the centrosome. one major role of centrosomes is to support the nucleation and organization of microtubules  <cit>  and thus ultimately to control vectorial protein transport. in a previous study, we could not detect an effect of hook <dig> on microtubule nucleation but our data revealed a contribution of hook <dig> to the maintenance of the radial arrangement of microtubules  <cit> . however, since cytoplasmic dynein also transports centrosomal proteins and microtubules  <cit> , it is not straightforward to distinguish direct effects on centrosomes from the indirect consequences of abnormal retrograde transport. future studies to unravel the molecular mechanisms by which hook <dig> contributes to the formation of aggresomes should take into consideration that hook <dig> may modulate microtubule-dependent retrograde transport.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together with previous findings that hook <dig> localizes to centrosomes, binds directly to centriolin and that interference with hook <dig> function disturbs the radial organization of microtubules, our results indicate that centrosomally localized hook <dig> promotes the generation or maintenance of aggresomes when misfolded proteins accumulate in cells. based on the functions observed for other hook homologs  <cit>  and the defects in the radial organization of microtubules upon interference with hook <dig> function  <cit> , we propose that hook <dig> function is required for the microtubule-based delivery of protein aggregates to pericentriolar aggresomes.
