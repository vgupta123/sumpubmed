BACKGROUND
cellular pathways and gene regulatory networks  are complex systems that emerge under natural selection and bare distinct evolutionary proprieties such as modularity. modularity is an effective mechanism for keeping perturbations confined while preserving the complete system  <cit> . it is widely observed in various organisms and is possibly a fundamental biological design principle  <cit> . emergent proprieties in networks also impose constraints on individual genes, mostly due to epistasis, leading to gene conservation. important enzymes and other essential proteins – as reported by flux balance analysis  <cit>  – tend to vary less than those under lower functional load  <cit> , indicating that the flow of matter through metabolic networks expounds an evolutionary constraint imposed on components of any given pathway. these findings where confirmed for yeast, in which highly connected enzymes evolve more slowly than less connected ones  <cit> . viruses intertwine their metabolic functions with those of the host cell, which allows infected cell to be understood as superorganisms, comprising the minimal essential condition for viral replication and biomagnification  <cit> ; yet how viruses organize their gene network remains an open question.

baculoviruses provide a rich environment where to investigate these relations, since these viruses have many completely sequenced genomes, each one encoding around one hundred plus open reading frames  with transcription strategies and defined overall temporal regulation. the baculoviridae constitute a family of invertebrate viruses that infect mainly insects of the order lepidoptera, with large circular, covalently closed, double-stranded dna genome  <cit> . the analysis of fifty-seven complete baculovirus genomes has shown  <dig> genes probably shared among all of them  <cit> , most of which are involved in essential processes, such as replication, transcription and oral infectivity. the anticarsia gemmatalis multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus  has been used in brazil and other countries to control the velvet bean caterpillar anticarsia gemmatalis , an important pest of soybean crops  <cit> . the prototype agmnpv isolate 2d   <cit>  has a genome of  <dig>  bp, which may encode  <dig> orfs  <cit> .

gene expression and replication cycle of baculovirus appear to be regulated by viral factors and the cellular milieu, where distinct gene classes are thought to be trans-activated  by closely related transcription complexes, causing expression to be controlled by distinct promoters, activated in a temporal concerted fashion during the infection cycle  <cit> . three main transcriptional phases can be distinguished: early , late and very late <cit> . the early phase precedes the onset of viral dna replication and includes transcription of genes involved in host modulation, viral dna replication and regulation of delayed early and late gene expression. the late and very late phases follow dna replication and include the expression of genes required for virus assembly and occlusion   <cit> .

an interesting feature of baculovirus transcription is that some orfs can be transcribed in tandem, spanning up to seven units  <cit> . specific genomic regions encode a wide variety of transcripts with different lengths, the so-called ‘overlapping transcripts’  <cit> . several tandem transcripts were mapped to different genomic regions of autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus   <cit>  and bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus  genomes  <cit> . the expression profiles of six agmnpv genes were investigated: egt <cit> ; p <dig> <cit> ; v-trex <cit> ; helicase <cit> ; iap- <dig> <cit>  and p <dig> <cit> . nevertheless, there was no comprehensive study done so far on its complete gene content transcription and regulation during the replication cycle. therefore, it is of interest to address the role of gene expression regulation in shaping baculovirus genome organization and evolution. here we analyzed transcriptional organization of agmnpv compared to randomized datasets in two distinct cell lines with different infection kinetics  <cit> . our analysis focused on:  the viral transcriptome profile,  the structural properties of its gene regulatory network ,  genomic arrangement of transcripts of distinct viral cycle phases and,  association of transcripts to distinct temporal promoter types.

RESULTS
viral genes are expressed sooner and at higher amounts in its permissive cell line
we performed a series of quantitative real-time pcr experiments to determine the expression profile of agmnpv-2d  <dig> predicted orfs  <cit> , following infection of two permissive cell lines with different infection kinetics  <cit>  at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 48h post infection . ufl-ag- <dig> was isolated from the natural host of agmnpv  <cit> , and iplb-sf- <dig> was established from a different noctuidae genus  <cit> . all pairs of amplicons for each gene were successfully amplified, sequenced and verified . except for orfs  <dig> and  <dig>  all remaining  <dig> orfs were expressed in both cell lines . to help inspection, the average values  from three independent experiments are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  and additional file 2: table s <dig> . several orfs reached significant levels of expression at different time points, reinforcing the expectation of a temporal structure in the viral cycle. at  <dig> h p.i., most genes were detected in both cells. nevertheless, genes were expressed earlier in ufl-ag- <dig> cells than previously reported in literature for most baculovirus, including agmnpv genes previously studied using northern blot and rt-pcr  <cit> . we compared the patterns obtained from the two cell lines considering the magnitude and the first detection  of significant gene expression. temporal differences in both cell lines were complex, with several orfs being expressed at different relative times in each cell line. for instance, certain genes were expressed much later in the iplb-sf- <dig> cell line ) and other genes were expressed in the same time post-infection ), or with a delay of  <dig> h such as cg <dig> , which was expressed a  <dig> h in ufl-ag- <dig> and  <dig> h latter in iplb-sf- <dig>  we observed that most genes were more expressed in the ufl-ag- <dig> cell line than in the iplb-sf- <dig> , reaching in some instances more than fifty-fold increase ), with the exception of pe <dig>  that was expressed at higher levels in iplb-sf- <dig> cells. furthermore, differences in expression intensity between cell lines decreased during infection, to the extent that at  <dig> h p.i., ag <dig>  ag <dig>  ag <dig> and some others were more expressed in iplb-sf- <dig> than in ufl-ag- <dig>  in sum, the relative temporal pattern for several genes changed depending on the cell line .

the inferred gene regulatory network has non-random proprieties
since we had three independent replicates of infection experiments lasting  <dig> hours each, we used a single  <dig> hrs time series to infer a putative agmnpv-2d gene regulatory network  from  <dig> orfs unfolded during infection in ufl-ag- <dig> and likewise, a single  <dig> hrs time series for iplb-sf- <dig>  under the assumption of a recurrent temporal regulation program for viral gene expression, this approach should maximize true gene-to-gene cross-correlation signal present in the data, while mimicking three successive infection cycles in a row. ranked lists of directed node interactions were generated with genie <dig> from expression data of agmnpv-2d infecting ufl-ag- <dig>  infecting iplb-sf- <dig> and the respective randomized data . one thousand links were necessary on average to assemble a single connected component with  <dig> nodes for all grn . nevertheless, the complete network for agmnpv-2d on ufl-ag- <dig> needed  <dig> edges to include all nodes into a single component, which was in agreement with similar but random grns, which had an average of  <dig> edges. preliminary exercises with random grns revealed that the data generated from our complete lists of directed node interactions generated with genie <dig> lacked essential complex features of known biological networks such as modularity. since we needed more realistic null models to better discern features of real networks from the data, we decided to keep only the relevant links that would be sufficient to generate a single component network while generating randomized networks by shuffling the real data time points. this procedure obliterated the time structure of the real data but kept its value range and sampling density.

the network architecture displays increasing modularity
the ‘most important’ links were pruned using the maximum neighborhood component  and the density of maximum neighborhood component  algorithms with hubba, down to  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> nodes , still maintaining a single large component yielding a ratio of around  <dig> edges per node. a model of the reduced agmnpv-2d grn in ufl-ag- <dig> cells  depicts few communities of highly interconnected nodes organized around a single large component, where the importance of links caused nodes to come closer together . we inspected the topological features and attributes of this agmnpv-2d grn with the network analysis plug-in in cytoscape and observed that the real data grn had a trend for the increase of average clustering coefficient  distribution as the number of neighbors of a node increased, while a negative dependence tendency was observed on the scrambled expression data . this trend was more pronounced in the infection in ufl-ag- <dig> cells . the average connectivity distribution of all neighbors of a node was also significantly different in real and scrambled data . as the number of neighbors increased, real data grn had a larger number of neighbors with higher anc with positive increase of anc . we also observed that the grn obtained infecting ufl-ag- <dig> differed from all others by having two nodes with stress centrality values one order of magnitude greater than that observed for both real and scrambled data:  egt  with sc =  <dig> and,  gp <dig>  with sc =  <dig>  followed by ag <dig> and ag <dig>  visual inspection of the force-directed grn layout reveals that these four nodes appear to interconnect adjacent modules in the grn . the grn in iplb-sf- <dig> shared several basic features with that unfolding in ufl-ag- <dig>  however, for the sake of brevity details on the reduced modularity , will be dealt with elsewhere. our results expounded a genuine modular architecture not caused by chance in the agmnpv-2d grn and they also indicated that this modularity was more pronounced in the infection in ufl-ag- <dig> 

it is of utter importance to emphasize that node linkages in our grns depict the relationships among regulatory elements inferred from gene expression profile . hence, it has to be made clear that the networks we inferred convey the implied associations among transcription regulation elements per se, and not necessarily gene product function relationships . fittingly, genetic regulatory functions are best understood when viewed in terms of intergenic linkages of diverse modalities, and these non-linear functions are not visible at the level of any individual gene  <cit> .

the gene communities  have redundant functions
we used the glay clustering method in cytoscape to detect ‘gene communities’  in the grn. the modularity  in ufl-ag- <dig> was  <dig>  and we found  <dig> communities adding to a total of  <dig> edges. this value  was significant since it was higher than the 99% upper value for the confidence interval  obtained for the other grns . we then observed that each one of the five modules was populated differently when we ordered the orfs in six functional categories  <cit> : virion and capsid , dna replication, transcription, host modulation or auxiliary . community i gathered most of genes associated with structural functions  while, more than 85% of its nodes  are conserved in almost all sequenced group i alphabaculoviruses . community ii was the most densely interconnected module , having one third of its genes  also conserved among group i. this community had the larger number of nodes associated with dna replication  and had slightly more  members with auxiliary functions . community iii was homogeneously populated with nodes from different functional categories. community iv consisted mainly of genes without assigned functions . community v had only four orfs and one of them was the helicase. interestingly, different functional classes were dispersed among different node communities, which is suggestive of redundancy.

gene function impacts on expression level variation and on grn topology
we further investigated how the grn architecture related to other features of nodes that were not considered during the inferential process. this is because the grn we inferred is based on rna expression through time and should reflect, to a greater extent, mostly the temporal program of gene expression. therefore, given that promoter elements are known to have considerable temporal specificity, we first searched promoter motifs upstream of the initiation codon of each orf and mapped as attributes in the five main communities . within this region,  <dig>  orfs had a late motif,  <dig>  contained an early motif,  <dig>  had both early and late, and  <dig>  lacked any recognized motif . the average clustering coefficient of early genes was higher for  <dig> genes with early promoters  than for  <dig> genes with only typical promoter elements , although not statistically different at a significance level of α≥  <dig> . community i had mainly nodes associated with late motifs  and a remarkable and significant absence of orfs with upstream unique early promoters . community ii had a large number of genes with unknown promoters .

given the apparent assortativity  of both gene function and promoter types, we then compared expression profiles among genes with correlated functions, such as:  replication: dnapol, lef- <dig>  lef- <dig> and helicase;  transcription: lef- <dig>  lef- <dig>  lef- <dig>  lef- <dig>  p <dig> and vlf-1;  structural proteins: pif- <dig>  pif- <dig>  gp <dig>  odv-e <dig>  odv-ec <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> , vp <dig>  vp <dig>  vp <dig> and p33;  core genes with unknown function;  some immediate-early genes that do not belong to the  <dig> conserved genes ; and carried out the statistical analysis  among groups followed by tukey’s multiple comparison test, assuming a significance level at p <  <dig> . we noticed that early genes and those associated with dna replication had less difference in their temporal and quantitative profiles between the two cell lines . this result suggested that core conserved functions do appear to have more invariance in the temporal structure of their expression program. crucially, this temporal consistency was also associated with a trend on the association of a key grn topologic feature and gene variability, since core functions  had a higher median betweenness centrality  with a large variance and a significantly lower genetic diversity , while satellite  functions had lower median betweenness centrality  with large variance and a significantly higher genetic diversity .

the spatial organization of regions of overlapping transcription  is important and conserved
to better infer the relation between time expression and gene position, we built a syntenic map for the complete genome of thirteen group i alphabaculoviruses  with twenty-two highly conserved ‘regions of overlapping transcription’  defined as multiply transcribed genomic loci encoding tandem rna transcripts of different lengths. these rots had almost the same overall order and relative orientation in all genomes, even when genomic reorganization events, such as inversions and gene deletions took place. when compared to other genomic regions, for all  <dig> genomes investigated, we found in rots a higher frequency of orfs with very short or absent intergenic spacers  . if rots entail the synthesis of overlapping transcripts in alphabaculoviruses, it is possible that approximately 40% of the agmnpv-2d genes  could be transcribed in tandem.

given that some adjacent co-transcribed genes belonging to rots grouped in the same community, as expected if these genes shared similar transcription regulation, we investigated if the potential expression of tandem rna transcripts could influence the regulatory association of nodes in the grn. we observed that, at a coarse-grain, the bulk of physical distances among agmnpv-2d genes, expressed in map units, did not show extensive positive correlation with euclidean distances among expression profiles of each individual orf , indicating that the association of gene expression profile is not explained by the tandem organization of rots alone. nevertheless, fifteen of the  <dig> shared genes among all baculoviruses  <cit>  are within rots, shown as asterisks over each physical map in additional file 6: figure s <dig>  moreover, among  <dig> nodes from community i ,  <dig> belonged to rots number  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . thus, one third of genes potentially expressed in tandem were neighbors in the grn. furthermore, the two-fold co-occurrence of five community i members in tandem, as observed in rots  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig>  was estimated to be low probability events  during monte carlo simulations . among all  <dig> nodes in the community ii,  <dig> represent genes arranged in pairs throughout the genome . nonetheless, just one pair of genes from rot  <dig> is probably transcribed in tandem, while orfs were scattered all over the genome in the communities iii, iv and v , as would be expected by chance . we also found that early, late and unknown promoter motifs  appear to be interleaved with some degree of heterogeneous distribution in the genome. for example a cluster of  <dig> orfs with late motifs in rots  <dig> to  <dig>  had a low chance probability  , while the chance of observing a triple tandem of early and late motifs was higher, . moreover, small orf sets containing similar promoter motifs were arranged contiguously, and most of them coincide with the  <dig> rots we found, which have mostly orfs with late or early and late promoter motifs. we also investigated how genes involved in the same biological process or with similar functions did cluster in the genome. as shown in figure 5c, the majority of genes from the same functional category were not adjacent but rather interspersed sense-wise. nonetheless, the occurrence of tree genes coding for virion proteins in the positive strand in rots  <dig> to  <dig> had a low chance probability , while the co-occurrence of  <dig> genes encoding transcription associated products in the positive strand in rot  <dig>  had a even lower chance probability  .

discussion
expression of structural and regulatory genes vary more on less permissive cells
the use of two different infection kinetics allowed us to observe contrasting aspects of the transcriptional program of agmnpv-2d in vitro, providing comprehensive, time-related information on the transcription dynamic and quantitative information on the expression of  <dig> of its  <dig> predicted orfs. the ‘sooner and higher’ expression pattern in ufl-ag- <dig> compared to iplb-sf- <dig> could be explained by the different states of adaptation of the virus to distinct cellular environments, since the infection in iplb-sf- <dig>  could be understood as a ‘perturbation’ of the agmnpv-2d grn. nevertheless, we have not noticed significant difference in most genes related with dna replication, such as dnapol , lef- <dig>  and lef- <dig>  that were expressed at the same time and at similar levels in both cell lines. while replication-associated genes had similar expression, most structural genes had a significant delay in iplb-sf- <dig> and notable differences in the magnitude of expression . hence, the expression profiles of the structural genes found in iplb-sf- <dig> could help explain the delay in viral morphogenesis routinely observed in our laboratory that was also reported for iplb-sf- <dig> cells  <cit> .

we consistently observed earlier expression for most of the genes than expected based on the observed for other baculoviruses. for example, the p <dig>  gene  was reported as late, expressed at  <dig> h p.i. in the acmnpv  <cit> . p <dig>  is a small protein , basic, arginine-rich and it is involved in the condensation of viral dna. it is not surprising to find this gene expressed earlier in the agmnpv-2d viral cycle, since dna replication begins at  <dig> h p.i.  <cit>  and p <dig>  is known to be necessary to package and stabilize the newly synthesized viral genome  <cit> . in addition, iwanaga and colleagues  <cit>  also found p <dig>  mrna and other transcripts earlier in infection, which corroborates our results and earlier observations on other dna viruses, such as fv- <dig> and civ  <cit> . crucially, the difference we observed could be due to the use of real-time pcr, which is much more efficient and requires fewer targets than hybridization techniques , detecting low amounts of rna initially present in each sampling time. this precocity could simply reflect differences between baculoviruses, given the earlier onset of dna replication in agmnpv-2d  compared to others, such as acmnpv   <cit> , sfmnpv   <cit>  and ldmnpv   <cit> .

furthermore, we also noticed that genes with more than one copy in the genome  had distinct expression profiles. for example:  iap- <dig>  was expressed earlier in ufl-ag- <dig> cells;  iap- <dig>  simultaneously, whereas;  iap- <dig>  showed expression only later, in both cell lines, being more expressed than iap- <dig> and iap- <dig>  gene duplication and redundancy are important mechanisms that allow adaptive evolution of genomes, and represent 8-20% of the gene content in eukaryotes  <cit> . we would argue that this allows one of the copies of a gene to evolve with lesser functional constraint  <cit> , which eventually could help it acquiring a new functionality .

conserved genes have higher centrality in a modular agmnpv-2d grn
by comparing with our randomized models the inferred grn in ufl-ag- <dig> cells, where five communities of nodes were identified, it is notable that it had a significantly different modular structure. this was made clear by the trend in both the average connectivity and the average coefficient distribution values for nodes as function of the number of neighbors they had . by looking at the agmnpv-2d grn as a single component we observed that nodes with highest importance, both in terms of bc and sc, included relevant host-interaction functions such as gp <dig>  and egt . the gp <dig> codes for an envelope glycoprotein paramount for effective membrane fusion during the secondary infection that is highly conserved in the group i nucleopolyhedroviruses   <cit> . interestingly, the expression of the egt gene in lymantria dispar multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus  was shown to be the genetic basis of climbing behavior and tree top disease in silkworm infected with baculovirus, which facilitates preferential predation of sick larvae while maximizing viral spread in the environment  <cit> .

a relevant property of our inferential procedure was that there was a positive correlation of reduced genetic diversity  and importance of the gene in the grn, as expected for key components of metabolic networks  <cit> . core conserved functions also had more temporal consistency of expression and distinct topologic features in the grn. these coherent results support our modeling effort, since they constitute independent evidence for a relationship among phylogenetic data of baculovirus genes and complex grn attributes inferred from expression data alone.

the observed modular heterogeneity that separates key genes that are functionally related on different communities could help accommodate redundancy and shield important functions, therefore maximizing grn robustness by compartmentalization  <cit> . for example, genes possibly associated with anti-apoptotic function   <cit>  were well distributed among three communities , while dnapol and helicase nested in different communities . likewise, assigning several different functions to a given module would also provide robustness by increasing functional redundancy  <cit> . nevertheless, some functional associations were evident. community i was highly populated by structural proteins associated with capsid and virion formation and promoters with early & late motifs . interestingly, in the agmnpv-2d  <dig> of  <dig> nodes in community i  are conserved in almost all group i alphabaculoviruses sequenced so far. this feature was also observed in community ii, in which one third of the nodes consisted of highly conserved genes, many of which were genes associated with dna replication. the clustering of genes in community ii with unidentified regulatory motifs could entail promoter motifs not yet described  <cit> , which is made more compelling giving the high connectivity among its members. spatially or chemically isolated modules composed of several cellular components and carrying discrete functions are considered fundamental building blocks of cellular organization, but their presence in highly integrated biochemical networks lacks quantitative support. in a key comparative study, the metabolic networks of  <dig> distinct organisms were shown to have modular organization and in e. coli, the hierarchical modularity had a good correlation with metabolic functionality  <cit> . spatially or chemically isolated modules composed of several cellular components and carrying discrete functions are considered fundamental building blocks of cellular organization, but their incidence and generality needs to be better investigated across a wider spectrum of organismic complexity, such as in viruses.

unfortunately, at this time we are not able to wire cell-coded nodes in the agmnpv-2d grn. nevertheless, we would argue that they should have not only a crucial role in the viral cycle, but also should be connected to the real viral grn  <cit> . however, viral grns encompass both the cellular and viral encoded functions necessary to complete the viral multiplication cycle  <cit> . accordingly, preliminary data on rna suppression subtractive hybridization  experiments  indicated that at least  <dig> cellular distinct genes were down regulated during infection at  <dig> h.p.i. . by using both gene ontology  and egene  programs while using the eggnog <dig>  database , we found sequences coding mainly for proteins related to metabolism or protein modification , ion transport and energy , nucleic acids metabolism  and several other functions at a lower frequency. but importantly, we found cellular genes at lower frequency, which are of direct relevance to viral host interaction such as:  the significantly hypo-expressed anterior fat body protein ,  defensin and,  heat shock  <dig>  . at this juncture, it is hard to assess the extent at which the hypo-expression of cellular genes does not simply reflect cellular degradation due to viral disruption of cellular homeostasis, or is due to interactions with viral gene products. notwithstanding, these preliminary results could imply that at least  <dig> additional cellular genes should be wired to the viral grn for a proper description of the viral life-cycle.

the conserved genome architecture of group i baculovirus has implications for gene expression
the presence of highly conserved rots in closely related baculoviruses, observed in our sinteny analyses, suggests a complex pattern of gene expression regulation, possibly also present in other baculoviruses  <cit> . the intergenic spacers among orfs in rots are either very short or absent, and overlapping genes are overwhelmingly located in these genomic regions . this would provide a competitive advantage, given that keeping genomes short would speed up genome replication at the cost of maximizing interdependence among superimposed genes  <cit> . interestingly, we also found evidence that the virus tries to keep similar attributes dispersed around the genome, mainly avoiding their tandem organization  with a few notable exceptions. a simple explanation for this observation would be that by avoiding clusters of similar attributes, the genome maximizes robustness of the viral grn. moreover, whilst rots are somehow conserved among group i npv, our findings suggest that physical proximity is not a reliable predictor of temporal patterns of gene expression, since in the agmnpv-2d there was no correlation between the position of genes in the genome and their temporal expression . these results are in line with the possibility that tandem transcripts from rots in baculovirus are not necessarily translated at once  <cit> . moreover, long mrnas of several genes have been observed late in infection  <cit> .

the region comprising from orf  <dig>  to  <dig>  in acmnpv encodes for diverse tandem transcripts  <cit> , which share the same t-rich 3’ end termination site  <cit> . these orfs are transcribed as monocistrons at the onset of infection  and later are transcribed in tandem  <cit> . the synthesis of long transcripts has been related to regulatory functions, such as promoter occlusion  <cit>  and rna interference   <cit> . promoter occlusion is caused by rna polymerase transcriptional complex activity during the transcription of upstream genes, blocking the monocistronic expression of downstream genes  <cit> . the expression of antisense sequences in tandem rnas has been suggested as a mechanism of down-regulation  <cit> . moreover, it has been assumed that overlapping transcripts should have a functional relevance for regulation of gene expression  <cit> . possibly, monocistronic expression is sufficiently high as to hamper mrna detection from tandem transcripts, which would help explaining the lack of correlation shown in additional file 7: figure s <dig>  fittingly, it has been suggested that regulatory elements functioning as ‘internal ribosome entry sites’  are functional in the iplb-sf- <dig> cell line  <cit> . furthermore, the capsid protein vp <dig> is probably synthesized by ires-mediated translation  <cit> , since its monocistronic transcript was not found in acmnpv and bmnpv gene expression programs  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the transcriptome of the agmnpv-2d indicated that conserved viral functions showed expression synchronicity, higher betweeness centrality and reduced genetic diversity, consistent with evolutionary constraints present in complex biological systems  <cit> . most orfs were expressed at ‘sooner and higher’ levels in a more permissive cell line. in  <dig> group i alphabaculovirus genomes, we found  <dig> highly conserved regions of overlapping transcription, whose extended 3’ utr could play a role in gene expression regulation  <cit> . the inferred grn had a modular topology, comprising five communities of highly interconnected nodes, consisting of genes with different functions, promoter motifs, and physical location in the genome. this modular heterogeneity was suggestive of architectural redundancy that could promote robustness  <cit> . the fact that a similar architecture was observed on a simpler grn, such the one we report for the agmnpv-2d, tends to support the idea that hierarchical modularity may be an extensive and generic self-similarity feature of system-level biological organization  <cit> .
