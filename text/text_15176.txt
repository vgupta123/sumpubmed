BACKGROUND
morphine, the most widely known opioid agent, has been largely used for pain management. besides non-analgesic uses of this drug, including experimental depression treatments as a control for opium addiction, has been developed  <cit> . despite these common uses, morphine produces disruptive negative secondary effects including sleepiness, drowsiness, blurred vision, constipation, and a decrease in blood pressure and appetite. with continuous use, morphine produces physical tolerance and addiction  <cit> . at present, it is widely known that there are genetic components in the susceptibility to addiction  <cit> , but the specific genes that are involved in this process are scarcely known.

opioids modify the expression profile of certain mrnas in many tissues, including central nervous system , the main target of drugs of abuse  <cit> . with the use of microarray analysis, extensive studies have been focused on identifying morphine-induced changes in gene expression . other opioid agonist as oxycodone  <cit>  and other drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, cannabis, methamphetamine, amphetamine, ecstasy, alcohol, heroin and nicotine , have also been studied. up to now, all microarray studies reporting gene expression changes in response to morphine have been conducted in rodents and humans. in particular, these studies were performed in whole tissues , distinct components of the nervous system , or cell cultures .

zebrafish  has been used in research related to drugs of abuse, studying the changes of gene expression produced by nicotine  <cit> , amphetamine  <cit> , and alcohol  <cit> . in addition, this teleost exhibits conditioned place preference , a technique used as a measure of drug reward or reinforcement  <cit> , as responses to amphetamine and opiates like morphine . these research works demonstrate the existence of a conserved drug-responsive ‘reward’ or reinforcement pathway in this teleost , suggesting that this species may show adaptive changes and behavioural correlates of addiction after prolonged exposure to addictive drugs.

zebrafish has also been used to study human disease-related pathways  <cit> , given this organism displays many benefits in comparison to other vertebrate animal models: small size, low cost, rapid development, transparency of the embryos, permeability to drugs, high fecundity, and transient genetic manipulation  <cit> . in this sense, zebrafish is an important tool to analyze in vivo the molecular mechanisms related to the neurobiology of drug addiction, withdrawal and reward  that cannot be fully established in other animals models. in contrast to mammalian embryos that develop in the uterus and are influenced by maternal biochemical processes, zebrafish embryos develop externally, avoiding the maternal effect on the embryos. this is essential when dealing with drug exposure, as the effects observed in mammalian embryos might be due to the susceptibility of the mother and not the embryo per se. the study of the direct effects of morphine in the embryos will provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the physical and neurobehavioral defects shown in fetuses and offsprings after maternal morphine consumption  <cit> .

therefore, we used microarray technology to obtain a profile of genes that are regulated by chronic morphine exposure on whole zebrafish embryos at 24 h post-fertilization , at the end of the segmentation period, during which the cns is being formed and differentiated  <cit> . we have shown that zebrafish has endogenous opioids and opioid receptors with high homology with other species  <cit> . the effects of morphine on embryos are probably mediated by the zebrafish mu opioid receptor , which exhibits highest affinity toward morphine from the known opioid receptors  <cit> , and is the opioid receptor essential to mediate rewarding properties of most drugs of abuse  <cit> . our previous studies indicate that at  <dig> hpf, the expression of oprm <dig> is higher than at other stages of development  <cit> . therefore, the use of  <dig> hpf zebrafish embryos treated with morphine can provide information on the implication of the opioid system in the maturation and differentiation of cns compared to any other stages of development. our goal in this research was to differentiate functional classes of genes and individual candidates involved in the endogenous systems underlying susceptibility to morphine actions; hence, our efforts were focused on elucidating the functional significance of sets of differentially expressed genes related in some way to neuronal function and/or cns development. to verify the results obtained by microarray,  <dig> selected genes were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription real-time pcr . after “silencing”  the oprm <dig> gene expression by morpholino oligonucleotide injection, we identified a subset of genes that are regulated by morphine and are related to oprm <dig> expression.

our results show that morphine produces changes in gene expression in zebrafish embryos as has been obtained in rodents and humans . thus, our data, besides being analyzed independently, was also compared to previous studies, in an effort to determine which alterations in gene expression are species-specific  and which may be common to all species in relation to addiction and pain studies. these results are important since several morphine-induced genes detected in zebrafish embryos may be putative targets in human models for addiction and pain processes.

RESULTS
microarrays analysis
to examine the global transcriptional profiles of zebrafish embryos, rnas generated from six pools of control zebrafish embryos and six pools of zebrafish embryos exposed to morphine were individually hybridized to affymetrix zebrafish genome arrays. a set of gene products corresponding to a total of approximately  <dig> probes on the arrays were confidently detected, based on signal intensity at a fixed value above background levels. differentially expressed genes were identified through the significance analysis of microarrays  method. as shown in figure  <dig>  we identified a total of  <dig> gene expression changes in the above mentioned comparison . of these,  <dig> genes were identified as known genes;  <dig> genes were significantly up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated . moreover, as shown in figure 1d, seven genes regulated, after chronic exposure to morphine, are represented by more than one probe set in the zebrafish microarray, and each of the probe set is differently deregulated ; for example: acireductone dioxygenase  <dig>  and dr. <dig> .s <dig>  − <dig>  fc) and selenoprotein x, 1a . therefore, distinct gene expression changes obtained for each one of the probe sets of each gene might mean that these genes show alternative splicing and each one of them has at least two isoforms that are differently regulated by exposure to morphine. finally, we specifically identified  <dig> genes  showing differential expression with a fc of at least  <dig> :  <dig> genes  were up-regulated and  <dig> genes  were down-regulated by chronic morphine treatment .figure  <dig>

gene ontology analysis
to enhance biological interpretation of the differentially expressed genes from our microarray studies, we sought if any of the biological processes or molecular functions were over-represented by these genes. therefore we performed a function enrichment analyses for the differentially expressed genes using the functional classification tool david bioinformatics resources. a representative selection of meaningful categories is illustrated in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  this analysis shows that some categories are specifically enriched in either up- or down-regulated genes, whereas other categories show both types of regulation. genes involved in oxidation-reduction processes :0055114), proteolysis , monosaccharide metabolic processes , macromolecular complex assembly  and generation of precursor metabolites and energy  represent an important part of both up- and down-regulated genes. macromolecule catabolic processes , dna metabolic process , protein catabolic process , homeostatic process , protein complex assembly , proteasome complex , and in general, post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones, mainly include down-regulated genes. there is an over-representation of up-regulated transcripts associated with secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism .figure  <dig>

validation of microarray data by quantitative reverse transcription real-time pcr 
rt-qpcr analysis was used to confirm a set of gene expression changes observed in the microarray analysis. chosen genes for rt-qpcr confirmation were mainly selected based on ontological categories with potential roles in the nervous system.

to choose the most stable genes as internal references for rt-qpcr data normalization, four candidates  were selected according to their expression levels detected in the microarray studied. the expression of these four genes was also measured by rt-qpcr. the normfinder software
 <cit>  was used to calculate the intra- and inter-group variations in their expression. our results indicate that β-act is the most stable gene, whereas rpl13a, β2 mg and ef1α are less stable . thus, the mean of threshold cycle  value and primer efficiency value of β-act was used for normalization.

as shown in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  we examined a total of  <dig> regulated genes after chronic morphine exposure on zebrafish embryos  using rt-qpcr technique. the up-regulated genes include: acyl-coenzyme a oxidase  <dig>  palmitoyl , growth factor receptor-bound protein  <dig> , and ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase iγb . the group of down-regulated genes is formed by the transcription factor sox19b  and wntless .table  <dig>

it is of interest that the probe set that presents the highest gene expression , putatively identified by affymetrix as wls, do not aligned to wls genomic locus. our in silico analyses demonstrated that when performing a blastn in the ensembl site, using as query an unique sequence of  <dig> nucleotides formed by the overlapping of  <dig> probes which constitute this probe set, the query sequence is aligned in two unidentified non-coding regions  that do not belong to wls genomic locus located on chromosome  <dig>  therefore, dr. <dig> .a <dig> probe set cannot be identified as wls gene . concerning the wls gene, we have detected that uniquely the dr. <dig> .s <dig> probe set is complementary to this gene .

we also analyzed four genes regulated by chronic morphine treatment involved specifically in dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission. a gene putatively related to serotonergic neurotransmission is bcl2/adenovirus e1b interacting protein  <dig> . three genes involved in dopaminergic neurotransmission are the plasminogen , coatomer protein complex subunit beta  <dig> , and the transcription factor otpb. furthermore, we included in our study three genes related to glutamatergic neurotransmission: one up-regulated  and two down-regulated .

we showed that two regulated genes, after chronic morphine exposure, are represented by more than one probe set in the zebrafish microarray . distinct gene expression changes obtained for each one of the probe sets for each gene might mean that these genes show alternative splicing and each one of them has at least two isoforms that are differently regulated by exposure to morphine.

all genes chosen for rt-qpcr confirmation and involved in neuronal functions are also related to other functional categories according to databases and consulted publications, such as development , signal transduction , transcription , apoptosis , energy metabolism  and, specifically, amino acid and protein metabolism  . it should be emphasized that among all genes confirmed by rt-qpcr some have previously been identified in distinct studies with mammals, such as camk1γ, plg, dao and wls

up‐regulation

down‐regulation


for our rt-qpcr analysis, we used the same rna samples as those used for the microarray hybridization experiment, and additionally, samples from eight independent chronic morphine treatments were also used. results from all the rt-qpcr experiments are summarized in table  <dig> and figure 5: acox <dig>  bnip <dig>  camk1γb, magi1b, and grb <dig> appeared as the most up-regulated transcripts with  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fc, respectively. we also clearly confirmed down-regulation of sox19b, grik-l, dao. <dig>  copb <dig>  wls and otpb transcripts . however, the up-regulation of plg was not confirmed by rt-qpcr since the result showed no significant deregulation. differences between rt-qpcr and microarray experiments occur for several reasons, including the fact that different probes are used for the microarray and rt-qpcr experiments , differences in the methods for normalization of expression data and possible false-positive expression changes. in addition, lower correlations between rt-qpcr and microarray results, such as for plg gene , were consistently reported for genes exhibiting small degrees of changes, generally less than  <dig>  fc  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
quantitative real-time pcr  was used to validate the microarray data. the genes selected showed similar expression changes when assessed by rt-qpcr as determined by microarray analysis. data are presented as morphine vs. control fold changes.



correlation between the microarray and rt-qpcr results for the  <dig> selected genes was then performed and the statistical significance of the correlation determined. as morey et al.
 <cit>  suggest, prior to performing correlation analysis, the dataset should be tested for normality using the shapiro-wilk test; our data points were not normally distributed and therefore spearman’s rho test was used. this test is the rank-based non-parametric equivalent of the more commonly used pearson’s correlation calculation  <cit> . the expression data for this gene set detected by microarray and rt-qpcr are plotted in figure  <dig>  the rt-qpcr and microarray methods showed excellent qualitative agreement on both up- and down-regulated genes. the correlation between microarray and rt-qpcr data obtained a high statistical significance . as mentioned before, the expression of several morphine-induced genes identified in previous studies , such as camk1γb, dao. <dig> and wls, was also analyzed to evaluate the data reliability and the sensitivity of microarray analysis. as shown in figure  <dig>  the induced expression of camk1γb and decreased expression of wls was successfully detected by both rt-qpcr and microarray approaches. these results confirmed the reliability of microarray analysis method in this study.figure  <dig>

the role of oprm1gene in morphine-induced regulation of differentially expressed genes in zebrafish embryos
the effects of morphine in the embryos are probably mediated by oprm <dig>  the opioid receptor that exhibits highest affinity towards morphine  <cit> . thus, in order to establish the role of oprm <dig> in the expression of the identified genes in our study, we microinjected specific morpholino  to knock-down -oprm <dig> at the one-to-four-cell stage in the yolk , embryos were analyzed when the  <dig> hpf stage was reached.figure  <dig>

after the mo microinjection of oprm <dig> we did not detect any morphological alteration in the embryos. we found a decrease of the mrna expression level approximately 95%  in the oprm <dig> which was similar to that was reported by previous studies of our group .

to establish that changes observed after mo microinjections were produced by mo action on their target, we also employed two more experimental groups : embryos injected with standard mo , and embryos with oprm1-mo injection plus exposure to morphine .

as shown in figure  <dig>  our results demonstrated that the gene expression of grb <dig>  acox <dig>  dao. <dig>  wls, grik-l, otpb and copb <dig> in the oprm <dig> morphants group  was decreased with respect to the control group, indicating that oprm <dig> is important in the expression of these genes . when the oprm1-mo group was exposed to morphine , grb <dig> expression was recovered and similar values were reached with respect to control groups, including mo control group . in contrast, analyzing the gene expression levels of acox <dig>  grik-l, otpb and copb <dig> in the oprm1-mo + morphine group, we observed an increase of these genes compared to the oprm1-mo group. the comparison of gene expression levels of these four genes in the oprm1-mo + morphine group relative to the two control groups shows that gene expression levels of grik-l, otpb and copb <dig> were comparable to the control groups , but in the case of acox <dig>  it showed a significant increase as compared to control groups . furthermore, dao. <dig> and wls expression did not undergo any significant change between oprm1-mo + morphine and oprm1-mo groups .

unlike the previous group of genes, the absence of oprm1-mrnas  increased the expression of bnip <dig>  camkγ1b and sox19b genes . thus, silencing gene transcription oprm <dig> indicates that it appears to be important in some way in the expression of these three genes. when the oprm1-mo group was exposed to morphine , sox19b expression was recovered and similar values were reached with respect to the control groups . in contrast, camkγ1b and bnip <dig> expression did not undergo any significant change between oprm1-mo + morphine and oprm1-mo groups . finally, magi1b and plg expression did not present any significant change among all experimental groups .

in conclusion, we found that morphine deregulated  the expression of grb <dig>  acox <dig>  grik-l, otpb, copb <dig> and sox19b through an unknown  mechanism; however, it required the expression of oprm <dig> to exert its influence on the expression of dao. <dig>  wls, bnip <dig> and camkγ1b. in other words, these four genes represent a putative collection of genes whose expression is related to oprm <dig> expression.

discussion
most of the published data addressing addictive drugs have focused on adults or neonates in mammalian models ; little information has been published concerning embryonic development and addiction . nevertheless, the use of morphine by pregnant women, besides affecting them personally, also affects their fetuses  <cit> . it is known that exposure to morphine may have additional consequences in the mammalian newborn, affecting immune function, neurodevelopment  <cit>  and long term neurobehavioral effects in combination with stress  <cit> .

in the present study, we used zebrafish embryos, since in this model external development can be observed, which is advantageous for the study of the actions of drugs in a specific embryonic stage .

we described four groups of genes regulated by chronic morphine treatment in zebrafish embryos. each group contains both, genes already known to be related to morphine activity, and new genes that have not been related to morphine until now. we have also described some genes whose expression is related to oprm <dig> expression:  immediate early genes  and other genes related to transcription;  genes involved in monoaminergic neuromodulation;  genes involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission; and  others genes involved in neuronal function.

immediate early genes and other genes related to transcription
genes previously known are iegs, such as members of the fos and jun families, which have important roles in processes such as brain development, learning and long-term neuronal plasticity  <cit> . rapid and transient induction of c-fos and jun-b has been described in response to acute morphine administration in different rat brain regions  <cit> . our results showed that a duplicate of junb was down-regulated  as well as their ortholog was up-regulated . this fact suggests that both genes have different functions, such as reported by postlethwait et al.  <cit>  indicating a subfunctionalization of a gene can occur after a gene duplication event. additionally, c-fos was also up-regulated . other known genes deregulated by morphine in zebrafish embryos and related to transcription are the zinc finger and btb domain containing  <dig>  and the myeloid leukemia factor  <dig> . for both genes some similar results have been reported in various studies. thus, zbtb <dig> was also induced after acute treatment by morphine in mice  <cit> , and this induction was lower after prolonged administration. furthermore, this gene was found to be positively related to cpp induced by morphine in mouse  <cit> . anghel et al.  <cit>  showed that the mlf <dig> was also up-regulated by short-term morphine and conversely down-regulated by long-term morphine in the pituitary gland of mice.

we also detected other genes involved in the regulation of transcription that have not been identified in previous studies after morphine treatment, for example, sox19b , sox19a , dbx1b , and her <dig>   that were also deregulated by amphetamine in zebrafish, like other members of these gene families   <cit> . with respect to sox19b, a gene that we validated by rt-qpcr, belonging to the family of soxb <dig> transcription factors , its expression is restricted to the developing cns, and specifically at 24 h of development in zebrafish, it is expressed in the dorsal spinal cord, in the hindbrain, in the tegmentum of the midbrain and in the telecenphalon  <cit> , acting as an important determinant during such anterioposterior regionalization process of the cns in zebrafish development  <cit> . therefore, we can postulate that the down-regulation of sox19b produced by morphine exposure in zebrafish embryos could intervene in some way by altering the cns anterioposterior patterning process.

genes involved in monoaminergic neuromodulation
it is widely known that alterations of biogenic amines, neurotransmitters derived by the enzymatic decarboxylation of naturally occurring amino acids , by drugs of abuse play an important role in the cns  <cit> . in particular, morphine increases dopaminergic neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens via the activation of dopamine cells in the ventral tegmental area , an area that possesses a high density of oprms , which may mediate reinforcing effects of morphine  <cit> . this activation mainly results from the disinhibition of inhibitory gabaergic interneurons in the vta. in zebrafish, dopaminergic and serotonergic systems share similarities with their mammalian counterparts  <cit> . although in mammals, dopaminergic neurons have been observed in the diencephalon, telencephalon and mesencephalon; in zebrafish, these neurons have only been detected in the diencephalon and telencephalon  <cit> , and appear during development between 18– <dig> hpf in zebrafish embryos  <cit> . in particular, zebrafish a11-type dopaminergic neurons , the major far-projecting dopaminergic neurons in this teleost, are located in the ventral diencephalic  and posterior tuberculum and express specifically the transcription factor otp  <cit> . we hypothesized that the dopaminergic neurotransmission during development may be altered by down-regulation of otpb gene. in zebrafish, two paralogous otpa and otpb genes have been previously reported  <cit>  and the requirement for otpa and otpb function during development of the larval diencephalon is partially redundant. both genes are essential for the development of specific subsets of diencephalic dopaminergic neurons in zebrafish and mice, of neuroendocrine cells and of specific neurons in the hindbrain in zebrafish . recently, barreto-valer et al.  <cit>  showed that cocaine also down-regulates both duplicate otp genes at  <dig> hpf zebrafish embryos, and these transcription factors, besides lim homeobox transcription factor  <dig> and 2-beta , were important in the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase , the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of dopamine, during the  <dig> and  <dig> hpf zebrafish embryonic stages  <cit> .

another new identified gene, involved also in dopaminergic neurotransmission and down-regulated by exposure to morphine in zebrafish embryos, is copb <dig>  this gene encodes the subunit  of coatomer complex, which is implicated in a variety of functions ranging from signal transduction, vesicular trafficking and transcriptional regulation to cell cycle control and apoptosis  <cit> . in particular, copb <dig> regulates the transport of dopaminergic receptor d <dig>  <cit> . thus, one mechanism by which drugs of abuse can regulate the function of dopaminergic receptors is promoting a decrease in the traffic of dopaminergic receptors from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane or vice versa  <cit> . the trafficking process could be regulated by changes in gene expression of proteins involved in this process, such as copb <dig>  on the other hand, kily et al.  <cit>  detected that copb <dig> was down-regulated by treatment of both nicotine and ethanol in zebrafish; these authors also demonstrated that copb <dig> is implied in the development of the notochord.

concerning genes involved in the serotonergic signaling pathway that in our study are deregulated by chronic morphine treatment, we can mention bnip <dig> , an unknown gene to date in the context of animals treated with morphine. we validated by rt-qpcr the results obtained by microarrays analysis and identified that the expression of this gene is related to oprm <dig> expression. in zebrafish, three ortholog genes have been described: bnip <dig> and bnip <dig>  not induced by hypoxia, and bnip3a, which is induced by hypoxia and is much closer to human bnip <dig>  which is related to cell death/survival  <cit> . in addition, it is known that rat bnip <dig> gene is differentially regulated during development and induces both apoptosis and autophagy. besides it is also involved in other biological processes, such as mitochondrial dynamics and intracellular calcium regulation  <cit> . we can hypothesize that the increase of bnip <dig> expression produced after exposure to morphine may be involved in a possible induction of apoptosis/autophagy.

it has interestingly been suggested that mammalian bnip <dig> protein can be a candidate for an intrinsic antidepressive effect-related factor and an antistress reaction factor  <cit> . enhanced bnip <dig> expression in ng108- <dig> cells, which possess the serotonin 2c receptor  mrna system, was observed after exposure to hochu-ekki-to , a  sino-japanese traditional drug with antidepressive effects, as well as after exposure to typical antidepressants  <cit> . in addition, rat brain bnip <dig> mrna expression is enhanced under stress conditions  <cit> . thus, both studies speculate that bnip <dig> mrna may be the candidate gene that is controlled by the 5-ht2cr mrna system, which plays an important role in the action of antidepressants together with serotonin transporters and/or noradrenaline transporters, and also may play a role in the maintenance and/or reformation of synapses in the brain. therefore, data published up to now  and our own data suggest that antidepressants in mammals and the treatment with morphine in zebrafish embryos producing an increase in expression of bnip3-type genes may initially seem to indicate an unfavorable pro-apoptotic state of the neuronal cell. in addition, a second conclusion of functional significance of bnip <dig> in zebrafish is that the study of this teleost during development may be a good model to confirm that bnip <dig> mrna is a candidate for one of the genes that are controlled by the 5-htr mrna system. the relation between morphine and serotonergic neurotransmission is supported by biochemical studies that demonstrated reciprocal functional interactions of the 5-ht receptor and the oprm <dig> following activation by morphine  <cit> .

genes involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission
in addition to monoaminergic neurons, the glutamatergic system plays a critical role in drug dependence and addiction  <cit> . in relation to this system, we identified groups of genes that are associated with the modulation of glutamate signaling, producing neuroplasticity, and are regulated by chronic morphine treatment, some of which  have not been described before. plasticity following chronic drug exposure, including morphine, has been described in the extended amygdala  and, in particular, at the interface between glutamatergic and monoaminergic systems  <cit> .

within the group of genes down-regulated by exposure to morphine in zebrafish embryos, we found dao. <dig>  which we have validated by rt-qpcr and identified as a gene related to oprm <dig> expression. this gene encodes a peroxisomal flavoprotein  that catalyzes the oxidative deamination of neutral and polar d-amino acids as d-ser  receptor  <cit> ) to hydrogen peroxide, and is expressed in mammals in the kidneys, liver and almost exclusively within astrocytes in the spinal cord . unlike our study, two papers of yoshikawa et al.  <cit>  showed that acute and chronic treatments with morphine increases the expression of dao and serine racemase , which catalyzes the direct formation of d-ser from l-ser, in most parts of rat brain, mainly forebrain. in our study, we detected that both genes were down-regulated by morphine exposure in zebrafish embryos . we have found several genes, as for example dao. <dig>  chemokine  ligand 12a , nadh dehydrogenase   <dig> beta subcomplex  <dig> , phytanoyl-coa dioxygenase domain containing  <dig> , and carbonic anhydrase ii  that were regulated in opposite directions in our study in contrast to other studies; such differences may be due to different morphine exposure areas, tissue  region and/or species.

interestingly, in rodents, spinal dao contributes to the development of central sensitization-mediated chronic pain and may be a potential target molecule for the treatment of chronic pain and as an efficacious molecule mediating morphine tolerance  <cit> . in conclusion, the decrease of dao. <dig> expression by treatment with morphine in zebrafish embryos contrary to that obtained with rodents opens a door hitherto unknown in the use of zebrafish as a model to study chronic pain and the effect of morphine in relation to the dao. <dig> gene. future studies will be required to resolve these unknowns, concerning the mechanisms of action of this gene in zebrafish.

other gene involved in serine metabolism, whose expression was also down-regulated by exposure to morphine in zebrafish embryos, is the transporter of neutral amino acids slc1a <dig> . slc1a <dig> seems to be the main uptake system of l-ser in neurons  <cit> . therefore, the presence of at least three genes differentially expressed after exposure to morphine and involved in serine metabolism implies that morphine can alter this type of metabolism influencing multiple processes involved in this amino acid, such as the regulation of nmda receptors  <cit> . other genes related to the primary excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter glutamate, and closely related to signal transduction, whose expression was altered by morphine treatment in zebrafish embryos were: a kainate-like receptor ; the transporter of glutamate slc1a3a ; glutamate-ammonia ligases 1a and b ; and glutamate dehydrogenase 1b . in the case of grik-l, we identified by in silico studies that dr. <dig> .a <dig> probe set target sequence is complementary to deep 3’ untranslation region  of si:ch211-251b <dig>  mrna, which encodes a protein similar to mammalian glutamate ionotropic receptors, in particular, a kainate-like receptor  <cit> . furthermore, xu et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that si:ch211-251b <dig>  as a target gene is regulated by hedgehog signaling during development, and their expression was confined to the dorsal neurons of the spinal cord in wild-type zebrafish embryos at  <dig> hpf. on the other hand, it is known that morphine causes alterations of gene expression in distinct subunits of postsynaptic glutamatergic receptors, including kainate receptors  <cit> . therefore, we suggest that the alteration of gene expression of grik-l by exposure to morphine could modify neural development of the spinal cord. concerning slc1a3a gene, it is known that alteration of the expression of high-affinity glutamate transporters, like this gene, has been reported in drug dependence and addiction animal models  <cit> . in zebrafish, two orthologs for slc1a <dig> were found  <cit> . slc1a3a was expressed in glia cells of the larval zebrafish brain similar to the expression of mammalian slc1a <dig>  throughout the cns  <cit> . slc1a <dig> is critical to maintain the extracellular glutamate concentration in a non-neurotoxic range  <cit> . interestingly, in mammals, it has been reported that the expression of slc1a <dig> mrna , but not slc1a <dig>  is decreased in the striatum/nucleus accumbens and thalamus of morphine-dependent rats  <cit> . therefore, we suggest that zebrafish slc1a3a, whose expression was down-regulated in embryos exposed to morphine, could be the key glutamate transporter in the regulation of the glutamate homeostasis in this species, and not slc1a3b or slc1a <dig>  finally, we also have observed opposite expression for the two orthologs glul genes, suggesting that both genes have different functions, such as reported postlethwait et al.  <cit> . glulb expression is diminished in the same way as mice glul is suppressed by morphine and by other addictive drugs, as methamphetamine, cocaine and alcohol  <cit> .

others genes involved in neuronal function
within the group of genes up-regulated by exposure to morphine in zebrafish embryos, we found camk1γb, validated by rt-qpcr and identified as a gene related to oprm <dig> expression. this gene is involved in ca2+ signal transduction in neuronal development, such as dendritogenesis and axonogenesis  <cit> . in particular, camki contributes strongly to ca2+-mediated transcription in neurons through crosstalk with the ras/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase  pathway. in cultured hippocampal neurons or acute slices, nmda-stimulated activation of erk is predominantly mediated through ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase /camki. furthermore, this pathway appears to be important for dendritic arborization where activity-dependent nmdar activation of the γ isoform of camki results in mek/erk-mediated creb regulated transcription of wnt- <dig> and microrna <dig>  <cit> . therefore, we hipothetize the overexpression of camk1γb produced by morphine exposure in zebrafish embryos may result in pronounced acceleration of axon formation, such as reported by davare et al.  <cit> .

another gene down-regulated by exposure to morphine and identified as a gene related to oprm <dig> expression is the wls, a putative orphan g-protein coupled receptor  that encodes a oprm <dig> interacting protein, and is conserved from worms to human  <cit> . juul et al.  <cit>  reported that wls was also down-regulated by treatment with morphine in a mouse model of neonatal stress, which suggests that it can promote the inhibition of wnt secretion. wls is expressed in various brain regions and peripheral tissues in mammals and during zebrafish embryogenesis suggesting that wls may play an essential role in regulating secretion of multiple wnts throughout the body and specifically, it might be critical for neuronal development and morphogenesis among other functions . in particular, zebrafish wls persists at  <dig> hpf in the spinal cord and in different areas of midbrain, hindbrain, midbrain-hindbrain boundary and ventricular zone. using antisense morpholinos to kd wls mrna translation in developing zebrafish, jin et al.  <cit>  suggested that wls expression was required for brain and ear development during zebrafish embryogenesis. wls may possibly serve as a substrate underlying the alterations in neuronal structure and synaptic organization characteristic of opioid dependence  <cit> . regarding these dependence processes, it should be emphasized that wls and oprm <dig> have been co-localized in somata and in dendritic processes in the murine striatum  <cit> , and that proteins that interact directly with the oprm <dig>  as wls, influence their biosynthesis, trafficking and signaling  <cit> , suggesting that these proteins could regulate these types of mechanisms, including signaling and trafficking. reyes et al.  <cit>  hypothesized that when morphine binds with oprm <dig>  the morphine-enhanced interaction between oprm <dig> and wls causes entrapment of wls at the cell surface, and wls is inefficiently internalized. subsequently, a larger proportion of oprm <dig> and wls are present at the plasma membrane enabling more oprm <dig> to be available for activation by morphine. thus, inhibiting wls function in mediating wnt secretion is related to a significant inhibition of wnt secretion in treatment with morphine. while wls is inefficiently internalized after morphine treatment, wls is efficiently internalized in the presence of -enkephalin   <cit>  as it is known that happens with morphine. in conclusion, wls down-regulate expression by treatment with morphine suggesting a decrease downstream wnt signaling, affecting neuronal development  and ear development in particular  <cit> . furthermore, we hypothesize that the decrease in wls expression could be a direct response mediated by the oprm <dig>  two reasons suggest this:  our demonstration that wls is a gene related to oprm <dig> expression, and  a direct interaction at the protein level of wls and oprm <dig>  therefore, both gene expression and protein levels of wls/wls are regulating actions of morphine through oprm <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we present here detailed changes in transcriptome of a critical period of zebrafish development, at  <dig> hpf, a key stage in the maturation and differentiation of cns, during chronic treatment of morphine.

using microarray technology, we identified different functional classes of genes and individual candidates  involved in the mechanisms underlying susceptibility to morphine actions related to cns development and, in general, the neural function. in particular, we identified  <dig> genes whose expression is altered after chronic morphine exposure in zebrafish embryos and, of these,  <dig> genes had a fc of at least  <dig> .

we found morphine-induced changes in gene expression that are specific for the zebrafish and other genes that are similar to mammals. several morphine-induced genes were exclusively detected in zebrafish embryos, which may be putative targets to analyze, in human models, the problems of addiction and pain. in addition, we demonstrated that some of morphine-induced genes identified in our study might also be related in some way with the opioid system, in particular, the oprm <dig> expression, which could open new lines for the treatment of pain and the molecular mechanisms involved in addiction.

we suggest that some of the genes differentially expressed after chronic morphine exposure in zebrafish embryos could produce alterations in neuronal development, in particular, in notochord , spinal cord  and other brain regions , cns patterning processes , differentiation and dopaminergic neurotransmission . besides a possible induction of apoptosis and/or autophagy and alteration of serotonergic signaling pathway by the deregulation of bnip <dig>  and activation of processes of axonogenesis and dendritogenesis  could be present in our experimental model. finally, the down-regulation of dao. <dig> expression by treatment with morphine in zebrafish embryos contrary to that obtained with rodents opens a door hitherto unknown in the use of zebrafish as a model to study chronic pain and the effect of morphine in relation to this gene.

in conclusion, morphine in distinct species can affect common targets and some of these molecular targets may turn out to be central in understanding pain and addiction processes.
