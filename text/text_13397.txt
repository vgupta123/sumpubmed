BACKGROUND
chromosomal change plays an important role in plant evolution, diversification, and speciation  <cit> . when carried out against a phylogenetic background  <cit>  comparative analyses of karyotypes allow inferences regarding evolutionary history.

detailed physical chromosomal maps, which enable evolutionary patterns and processes to be determined, can be constructed using fish  from both single copy and repetitive dnas, such as rdna, species- or genus-specific repetitive dnas, individual chromosome dnas  <cit> . patterns of chromosomal evolution using fish have been established in several economically important plant genera  as well as in model organisms and their wild relatives . comparative evolutionary cytogenetics of wild plant groups, however, has been much less explored .

the markers of choice for cytogenetic evolutionary studies include tandemly repeated genes encoding 5s and 35s rrna within the nucleus. the 35s rdna loci  are located in the nucleolar-organizer regions , while tandem arrays of 5s rdna map independently of them . copy numbers of 5s rdna are usually lower than 35s rdna  <cit> . since the coding regions of these two markers are conserved across large evolutionary units  <cit>  their localization provides useful landmarks for chromosome identification  <cit> . partial dna sequences of these two rdna types  are also commonly used for inferring phylogenies  <cit> . this allows the interpretation of cytological information in a strict phylogenetic context, giving detailed insights into the patterns of evolution of genomes.

a particularly suitable system for analyzing the role of chromosomal change in plant diversification and speciation is provided by the genus prospero salisb. . this genus is distributed around the whole mediterranean basin, north to britain and russia . across this area prospero exhibits exceptionally high levels of chromosomal variation, with basic chromosome numbers of x =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  alongside levels of ploidy up to about 20-fold  <cit> . three species are commonly recognized in the genus: p. obtusifolium  speta  and p. hanburyi  speta , both chromosomally stable, and a dynamic species complex referred to as p. autumnale  speta. within p. autumnale, up to  <dig> smaller, local, segregates have been described  <cit> , but these are only subtly differentiated morphologically . thus, in this paper, we recognize only the three species as comprising prospero for the clarity of the data interpretation. the relationship of genomic, chromosomal, and phylogenetic analyses to species delimitation and their correlation with distinct morphological characters will only emerge from broader evolutionary studies of the genus.

p. obtusifolium  and p. hanburyi  are morphologically distinct entities found within the range of the p. autumnale complex, the former two being geographically restricted to the western mediterranean and to the levant respectively. they are known only as diploids. by contrast, the p. autumnale complex exhibits a spectacular array of genomic and chromosomal variation, unparalleled in any other flowering plant, with multiple basic chromosome numbers, a huge range of levels and complexity of polyploidy, and a spectacular array of chromosomal polymorphisms . four distinct diploid cytotypes with basic chromosome numbers of x =  <dig>  x =  <dig>  and two with x =  <dig>  have so far been described  <cit> .

the two x =  <dig> diploid cytotypes are referred to as aa and b7b <dig>  with aa found only in countries bordering the atlantic ocean in iberia and north africa and b7b <dig> occupying the countries around the mediterranean basin and on its islands; they overlap only in spain  <cit> . the karyotype morphologies of aa and b7b <dig> are very similar, but differ significantly in chromosome size and dna amount, and, more trivially, in the location of the single nor within chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . cytotype b7b <dig> has been hypothesized to be most similar to the ancestral karyotype of the complex  <cit> .

diploid plants based on x =  <dig>  are endemic to crete. the b6b <dig> karyotype carries a large submetacentric chromosome referred to as f <dig> , while the remaining chromosomes correspond closely in morphology and homoeology to chromosomes 1– <dig> of the b7/a genomes. a diploid of constitution b5b <dig> is endemic to libya  <cit>  and carries two fission/fusion chromosomes, assigned to as f <dig> and f <dig>  with respect to the karyotype of a/b <dig> genome  <cit> .

despite the enormous chromosomal and dna amount variation within the p. autumnale complex, there is no large-scale accompanying morphological differentiation. the mechanisms involved in chromosome change and its directionality, might therefore allow us to infer evolutionary patterns within the genus. within p. autumnale, we have previously  <cit>  attempted to establish phylogeny from chromosome numbers and karyotype structure supplemented by analyses of meiotic configurations in diploid hybrids. two sequential chromosomal fusions were proposed for the reduction of the chromosome number from x =  <dig>  to x =  <dig>  and x =  <dig>   <cit> . in addition to this descending dysploid shift, genome size also varies, with a major discontinuity between genomes b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> and the large genome a  <cit> . no evolutionary directionality has been ascribed to this change.

phylogenetic relationships within the family hyacinthaceae have been inferred from plastid dna sequence analyses  <cit> . these studies, however, included only one or two accessions of prospero , so no assessment of phylogenetic relationships within the genus could be made. this present study provides the first comprehensive analysis of phylogenetic relationships among all the diploids identified in the genus prospero, based on karyotype and genome size changes, analyzed against a rigorous dna phylogeny, allowing previous hypotheses concerning karyotypic evolution to be tested. this study provides also a framework for studying evolutionary patterns in polyploid genomes of prospero.

the aims of this study are to:  establish numbers and locations of 5s and 35s rdna loci in all diploid species and cytotypes of prospero;  analyze the evolution of rdna loci and genome size in a phylogenetic context;  test previous hypotheses concerning the evolution of basic chromosome number in the p. autumnale complex; and  propose a new model for chromosomal rearrangements within the genus and to evaluate their role in the diversification of taxa.

prospero obtusifolium
all six plants of p. obtusifolium were diploid with 2n = 2x =  <dig> . the karyotype consisted of three pairs of submetacentric and one pair of sub-telocentric chromosomes  with haploid karyotype length  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm . a single nucleolar-organizing region  was localized within the pericentric region of the short arm of chromosome  <dig> . the 1c dna amount of p. obtusifolium was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg .

2scale bar = 1 μm; only the chromosomes bearing rdna are shown: filled and open circles indicate position of 35s and 5s rdna loci, respectively.

prospero hanburyi
the three plants of p. hanburyi were diploid with 2n = 2x =  <dig> , comprising four pairs of near-metacentric and three pairs of submetacentric chromosomes . the hkl was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm . a single nor was localized subterminally on the short arm of chromosome  <dig> . this contrasted to the interstitial localization of nors in all other prospero taxa and cytotypes. the 1c content of p. hanburyi was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg . the karyotypes of these two species showed little structural similarity to the diploid karyotypes within the p. autumnale complex .

the prospero autumnale complex
the four diploid cytotypes  of the p. autumnale complex differred not only in basic chromosome number, but also in karyotype structure due to fusion/fission and genome size .

cytotype aa 
in all six individuals the karyotype consisted of five sub-metacentrics , one sub-telocentric , and one near-metacentric . the hkl was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm  with a 1c dna content of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg . a single nor was adjacent to the centromere in the long arm of chromosome  <dig> .

cytotype b7b <dig> 
the karyotype in seventeen individuals consisted of five sub-metacentrics , one sub-telocentric , and one near-metacentric , each identifiable by size and morphology .

the karyotypes of a and b <dig> genomes were extremely similar in morphology and the numbers indicated homoeologies. hkl and 1c dna contents have been established in selected individuals, which differed in their 5s rdna locus number . the hkls were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm while genome sizes were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg respectively . a single nor was adjacent to the centromere in the long arm of chromosome  <dig> . cytotype b7b <dig> is the most widespread in p. autumnale.

cytotype b6b <dig> 
in all eleven bulbs, the karyotype consisted of four sub-metacentrics , one sub-telocentric , and one large sub-metacentric presumptive fusion chromosome classified as chromosome number f <dig>  chromosome numbering again reflects homoeology to b <dig> and a genomes .

in nine individuals, both nors were located in the long arm of the chromosome homoeologous to chromosome  <dig>  although in a more median position . the other two individuals  have apparently undergone translocation of one or both nor regions, respectively. in one, the nors were located in both homologues of chromosomes  <dig> , and in the other in chromosome  <dig> and the same position on chromosome  <dig> . the hkl of standard individuals was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm with a 1c dna content of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg . the hkl of the nor translocation heterozygote h <dig> was slightly lower and the genome size slightly smaller  while nor translocation homozygote h <dig> had hkl of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm and genome size of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg .

cytotype b5b <dig> 
in the six b5b <dig> individuals, the karyotype comprised two sub-metacentrics , one sub-telocentric  , a large sub-metacentric fission/fusion chromosome f <dig>  and a sub-metacentric fission/fusion chromosome f <dig> . in b5b <dig>  the hkl was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm and the 1c dna amount  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pg . it has been proposed previously that b5b <dig> results from two fusions, one identical to that in the b6b <dig> karyotype . the second fusion  was more complex, but has been interpreted to be a result of chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> fusion  relocating the nor to the short arm of an enlarged fusion chromosome f <dig> .

5s and 35s rdna localisation
the three species of prospero and all cytotypes invariably had one 35s rdna locus per genome . its chromosomal localization was predominantly interstitial and adjacent to the centromere, except in p. hanburyi where it was sub-terminal. either one or two 5s rdna loci were found with a third, minor, locus in p. obtusifolium . locations of these loci were more variable than the 35s rdna loci.

i. the 35s rdna locus of p. hanburyi was sub-terminal on the short arm of chromosome  <dig>  whereas the single 5s rdna locus was located on the long arm of metacentric chromosome  <dig> adjacent to the centromere .

ii. in p. obtusifolium, the 35s rdna locus was on chromosome  <dig>  flanked on each side by a 5s rdna locus . an additional minor 5s rdna locus was seen occasionally, located on the long arm of chromosome  <dig> .

iii. all cytotypes of p. autumnale possessed a single interstitial 35s rdna locus, usually closely adjacent to a centromere. there were either one or two 5s rdna loci in different cytotypes :

– in the aa cytotype, a single 5s rdna locus was found in the pericentric region of the short arm of chromosome  <dig> . the 35s rdna locus was close to the centromere in the long arm of chromosome 3;

– cytotype b7b <dig> usually had a single 5s rdna locus localized interstitially within distal region of the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  some individuals, however, had two loci in close proximity at this position, suggesting either local duplication of this chromosomal region or of the locus itself . the single 35s rdna locus was pericentromeric on chromosome  <dig> long arm , in a similar location to that in aa ;

– cytotype b6b <dig> always had two 5s rdna loci, a smaller one in the pericentric region of the short arm of chromosome  <dig> as in cytotype aa  and a larger one in the distal region of the long arm of chromosome  <dig> as in b7b <dig>  in most plants, there was a single 35s rdna locus interstitial in the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  although further from the centromere than that in aa and b7b <dig> . two plants differed from the standard pattern in their rdna localization. in one individual, the 35s rdna locus was close to the centromere in the short arm of submetacentric chromosome  <dig> . in the other, one copy of the locus was detected in chromosome  <dig> and the other in the typical position on chromosomes  <dig> .

– in the b5b <dig> cytotype, putative fusion chromosome f <dig>   <cit>  had a 5s rdna locus distal in one arm . the 35s rdna locus was localized interstitially close to the centromere within the short arm of the second-largest chromosome in the complement , the putative fusion chromosome f <dig>   <cit> .

phylogenetic relationships within prospero based on its sequence data
sequence analyses of its <dig> and its <dig> regions, including the intervening  <dig> s coding region, of 35s rrna have provided insights into the relationships amongst the diploids of prospero . the length of the its region of the  <dig> analyzed diploid prospero accessions ranged from  <dig> to 785 bp and the final, aligned dataset was 793 bp long. the maximum parsimony analysis of the its dataset resulted in four most parsimonious trees with a length of  <dig> steps . the final tree was rooted with two outgroup taxa . the genus prospero was monophyletic . p. obtusifolium  and p. hanburyi  each formed well-supported clade . p. obtusifolium and p. hanburyi its regions differed by  <dig> substitutions, one of which is within one of two insertions  shared only by these two taxa . p. hanburyi had an additional unique insertion of 3 bp. p. hanburyi and p. obtusifolium differed from b7b <dig> diploids by the above mentioned two shared insertions and by  <dig> and  <dig> substitutions, respectively . p. obtusifolium  was recovered as sister to clade comprising p. hanburyi and p. autumnale . the p. autumnale complex formed a monophyletic and well-supported clade . within this clade cytotype aa , formed a monophyletic sub-clade . its sequences of all aa individuals were identical. its region of cytotype aa has two unique insertions . the b7b <dig> cytotype  forms a well-supported clade . this was the only cytotype within which its sequence variation has been observed . interestingly, b7b <dig> clade includes all six individuals of the b5b <dig> cytotype nested within it , or forming a sub-clade of unresolved relationship to b7b <dig> subclade with a bootstrap support of  <dig> . all b5b <dig> individuals shared a unique 2 bp insertion compared with the b <dig> its sequence.

the b6b <dig> cytotype  formed a well-supported monophyletic group . the two b6b <dig> individuals with the 35s rdna translocation did not show any its variation compared to other analyzed individuals. the its sequences of genomes b <dig> shared four unique substitutions .

discussion
chromosome numbers and karyotype variation
the genus prospero is highly variable in chromosome number and chromosome structure. basic numbers have changed by dysploidy  and, superimposed on this, high levels of auto- and allopolyploidy have evolved  <cit> . three species are commonly recognized in the genus: p. obtusifolium, confined to the western mediterranean islands and adjacent mainland, exclusively diploid with 2n = 8; p. hanburyi from the levant, also a diploid but with 2n = 14; and the widespread p. autumnale complex with basic numbers of x =  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> and an elaborate, reticulating auto- and allopolyploid series .

within the p. autumnale complex, four distinct cytotypes have been described and characterized so far  <cit> . a fifth genome, designated as b7* , with chromosomes slightly smaller than b <dig> but of the same complement morphology, has so far been found only in allopolyploids on crete  <cit> . the diploid cytotypes differ in chromosome number , in karyotype structure with one and two putative fusions resulting in b <dig>  and b <dig>  respectively, in nor position, and in genome size, with a major difference in dna amount between the a genome and the other three  <cit> . these studies are supported here, except that a few individuals with translocations were detected.

a combination of karyotypic features  allows unambiguous identification of each cytotype as well as identification of homoeologous chromosomes between them . the karyotypes of p. hanburyi and p. obtusifolium differ from those of the p. autumnale complex to such an extent that it is impossible to infer any homoeologies between these taxa.

evolution of 5s and 35s rdna loci
5s and 35s rdna have been mapped to the chromosomes of all diploid species and cytotypes of the genus prospero. this has allowed us to identify two and sometimes three chromosome pairs unambiguously . thus, despite the high frequency of chromosomal rearrangements within and between populations of the p. autumnale complex - inversions, supernumerary segments, translocations, b-chromosomes  <cit>  - all diploid cytotypes possess unique and stable locations of their rdna loci . by contrast 5s rdna proved to be more variable in locus number and location , a phenomenon observed in other plant groups  <cit> . despite this variability, 5s rdna is frequently more stable in its position than 35s rdna, which may vary substantially in distribution between related species  and even between cells in individuals of species of genus allium <cit> .

p. obtusifolium exhibits a remarkable pattern of rdna distribution, unique within prospero: juxtaposition of a centromere and the 35s rdna locus, with a 5s rdna locus on each side . co-location of 35s and 5s rdna within the same chromosome or chromosomal arm has, however, been reported in other plant groups  <cit> , sometimes even as 5s rdna units inserted within 35s rdna repeats  <cit> .

within hyacinthaceae, genera related to prospero possess basic numbers of x =  <dig> or higher  <cit> . prospero obtusifolium forms the basal clade in the its-derived phylogeny. it probably represents an old segregate within the genus, which is estimated to be  <dig>  ma old  <cit> , and has experienced chromosomal rearrangements leading to a drastic chromosome number reduction to x =  <dig> 

p. hanburyi is the only species in the genus to possess a subterminally localized 35s rdna locus, instead of interstitial secondary constrictions adjacent to centromeres. it has been argued that a subterminal position for 35s rdna is ancestral  <cit> , but in prospero it might also be associated with a high potential of 35s rdna for generating chromosomal translocations  <cit> . the single 5s rdna locus is located in unique chromosomal position close to the centromere of chromosome  <dig>  it shares a common ancestry with the 5s rdna locus of chromosome  <dig> in p. autumnale, as indicated by the phylogenetic analyses of the non-transcribed spacer region .

in contrast to the other two species, the diploids of the p. autumnale complex lend themselves to comparative karyotype analysis, due to the well-preserved chromosomal homoeology during evolution. homoeology was first demonstrated in a and b <dig> diploid homoploid hybrids  <cit> , and was extended to b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> by analyses of meiotic pairing in diploid hybrids . the position of 35s rdna is relatively conserved in the complex: within the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  except when affected by the fusion in cytotype b5b <dig>  the nor chromosome  in the b <dig> genome has a similar size and arm ratio to chromosome  <dig> in b <dig>  but it differs in the proximity of the nor to the centromere, probably as a result of paracentric inversion . this regularity of interstitial position of 35s rdna supports the earlier hypothesis  <cit>  that it might provide greater karyomorphological stability during race or species evolution. the 5s rdna loci are either interstitial in the distal part of the long arm of submetacentric chromosome  <dig> and/or proximal in the short arm of submetacentric chromosome  <dig>  except where fusion has occurred in cytotype b5b <dig> . the only variation observed in the complex was a putative duplication of 5s rdna locus in some copies of chromosome  <dig> of b7b <dig>  although phylogenetic analyses of its sequences did not ascribe any evolutionary significance to this duplication, phylogenetic analyses of the more variable 5s rdna spacer  indicated that individuals carrying this duplication are more closely related to each other than to individuals carrying a single copy of the locus.

in addition to the between-cytotype variation in the number and distribution of 5s rdna loci, variation in fish signal intensity has frequently been observed . signal strength differences are likely to be correlated with copy-number variation at the target site  <cit> .

phylogenetic interpretation of chromosomal variation in prospero
the phylogeny of prospero, inferred from its sequences, strongly supports monophyly of each species and diploid cytotype. p. obtusifolium and p. hanburyi are always recovered as subsequent sister groups to the p. autumnale complex. neither species, however, has obvious chromosome homoeology with p. autumnale. by contrast, the its phylogeny coupled with knowledge of chromosome numbers, karyotype structure, and genome size allows us to test previous hypotheses concerning the direction and mechanisms of karyotype evolution within the p. autumnale complex .

we offer a modified and more detailed model of the chromosomal changes involved in the origin of the cytotypes . each cytotype forms a well-supported clade, with cytotype aa being the most distinctive. cytotype aa is found only in the western distribution area of the genus, adjacent to the atlantic ocean and might have been isolated by a pleistocene glacial advance.

the its phylogeny supports the origin of cytotype b5b <dig> from b7b <dig> rather than from b6b <dig>  with genome b <dig> being sister to b <dig>  the close relationship of the localized cytotype b5b <dig> within the widespread cytotype b7b <dig>  suggests its recent origin, and that it is the youngest segregate of the complex. intra-cytotype its sequence variation has only been observed within the widespread cytotype b7b <dig>  this contrasts with a lack of variation in all other more geographically localized or endemic cytotypes and species. thus phylogenetic and chromosomal data, and particularly the distribution of 5s rdna loci in cytotypes b5b <dig>  b6b <dig>  and b7b <dig>  suggest independent and not sequential dysploidy: from x =  <dig> to x =  <dig> and independently from x =  <dig> to x =  <dig> 

model of karyotype evolution in prospero autumnale complex
genome size estimations presented in the current study  differ from genome size measurements published previously   <cit> . these previous measurements have been performed using feulgen densitometry which could account, at least partially, for the discrepancy. however, prospero genome size measurements reported in another study  <cit>  are largely congruent with our data.

the chromosome number and structure of the prospero ancestral karyotype  remains obscure, as do the karyotype relationships of the three species . the ancestral chromosome number of the prospero autumnale complex has been inferred as x =  <dig>  and this is also supported by phylogenetic reconstructions using extended plastid, its, and 5s rdna spacer sequence datasets , with the ancestral karyotype similar in overall morphology to the a and b <dig> genomes  <cit>  . these genomes each possess one 5s rdna locus either in long arm of chromosome  <dig>  or in the short arm of chromosome  <dig> . sequencing of the nts regions of these loci shows them to be distinct . we propose that the ancestral genome had both of these loci. the ancestral genome could have resembled a or b <dig> in size, or indeed be different from both, but increase is thought to be predominant to, and more rapid than, genome decrease. so resemblance of b <dig> to the ancestral karyotype is likely to be the most parsimonious, and genome increase might have occurred in the western refugium during a glacial maximum .

loss of 5s rdna from chromosome  <dig>  of the ancestral karyotype has likely accompanied evolution of cytotype aa. its evolution has also been accompanied by nearly 70% genome size increase . loss of the 5s <dig> rdna locus from the ancestral karyotype would give rise to cytotype b7b <dig> , now widespread across the whole mediterranean basin. interestingly, seven of the seventeen b <dig> diploids analysed carried a duplication of the 5s <dig> rdna locus.

genome b <dig> may have originated from the ancestral karyotype with x =  <dig> by fusion of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> . it is also necessary to postulate a pericentric inversion and loss of a centromere in its evolution  <cit> . previously, it had been proposed that the b <dig> genome evolved by chromosome fusion directly from b <dig> . evidence for the direct evolution from an ancestral karyotype rather than directly from b <dig> comes from the retention of both the 5s rdna loci by b <dig>  the analysis of meiotic pairing in hybrids does not differentiate between the two hypotheses  <cit> . the genome of b <dig> is 44% larger than b <dig>  and the difference affects all chromosomes of the complement nearly equally. this is observed as bivalent asymmetry during meiosis in hybrids.

it was also proposed that b <dig> arose directly from b <dig> by a second fusion event  <cit> . the evidence came from the gross similarity of the largest fusion chromosomes in genomes b <dig> and b <dig> , and the presence of two trivalents at meiosis in b5b <dig> hybrids. however, the molecular evidence presented here is consistent with b <dig> arising from b <dig>  but supports evolution of b <dig> directly from an ancestral species of p. autumnale. the fusion chromosomes in b <dig>  and b <dig> , therefore, have independent origins. no molecular markers are yet available to unequivocally identify chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  so the relationships of the fusion chromosomes cannot be explored more closely. the fusion chromosome f <dig> in cytotype b <dig> involving chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig> or  <dig> , gives rise to a near-metacentric, the largest in the complement. as expected, this carries a 5s rdna locus, which has been confirmed as 5s <dig> by sequencing . in addition, the genome size of b <dig> is 12% higher than b <dig> but it cannot be established at what point this may have occurred. the cytotype b5b <dig> is probably the most recently evolved diploid in the complex and is endemic to libya, where it is the only race  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
phylogenetic analysis has confirmed fusion and basic number reduction as opposed to fission and basic number increase as the evolutionary mechanisms characterizing karyotype evolution in the p. autumnale complex. dysploidy has occurred twice via independent fusions, once perhaps ancestral from x =  <dig> to x =  <dig>  and later a second time from x =  <dig> to x =  <dig>  this extensive chromosomal evolution contrasts very strongly with a lack of morphological diagnostic features within the genus, which are particularly weak within the p. autumnale complex  <cit> . new species described in last few decades usually refer to small populations that differ mostly in quantitative characters, whose evolutionary significance needs to be evaluated using a more thorough sampling. diversification and evolution of this genus, then, has occurred primarily through genome restructuring, with little involvement of morphological change. genetic processes may, of course, be implicated in the generation of chromosomal change. thus, the genus prospero, and in particular the p. autumnale complex, provides a model system for studying the role of chromosomes in plant diversification.

this study of diploids in prospero has laid foundations  to address the evolution of auto- and allopolyploidy within the complex which appear to follow different evolutionary trajectories; ,  to interpret the mechanisms involved in the origin and persistence of the many other types of chromosomal rearrangements that are found abundantly across the complex , and  to investigate the patterns of evolution of repetitive dnas within the genus.
