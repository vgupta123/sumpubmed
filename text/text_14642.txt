BACKGROUND
the smoothelin-like  <dig>  protein was discovered as a novel protein phosphorylated in response to cgmp stimulation of ileal smooth muscle tissue  <cit> . the protein contains a calponin homology domain at its carboxy-terminus, thus it was originally termed the calponin homology-associated smooth muscle protein . experiments completed in situ with isolated smooth muscle tissues suggest a physiological role for smtnl <dig> in promoting the relaxant actions of pka/pkg  <cit> , and studies with smtnl <dig> genetic knock-out mice link smtnl <dig> with adaptive responses to exercise in both smooth and skeletal muscle  <cit> . more recent studies have provided indications that smtnl <dig> also governs smooth and skeletal muscle adaptations during sexual development and pregnancy  <cit> . although less well studied at the molecular level, current data suggests smtnl <dig> plays an important regulatory role in smooth muscle contraction and development. the protein is known to interact with tropomyosin  <cit>  and with apo-calmodulin in a ca2+ dependent manner  <cit> , to inhibit myosin phosphatase activity  <cit>  and to regulate the expression of the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit   <cit> .

as its name suggests, smtnl <dig> is closely related to the smoothelin family of proteins  that are used as markers for contractile smooth muscle cell differentiation  <cit> . the specific biological role of the two smtn isoforms, a  and b , remains poorly defined; however, the analysis of mice lacking smtn-a or -b has revealed critical roles for each of the proteins in intestinal and vascular smooth muscle performance, respectively  <cit> . interestingly, the smtn-a and smtn-b isoforms are expressed from alternative promoters, with the intragenic promoter of smtn-a residing within exon  <dig> of the smtn gene  <cit> . thus, one smtn gene gives rise to both smtn-a and smtn-b mrna with lengths of  <dig> and  <dig> nt, respectively. the smtn promoter is controlled by serum response factor  and myocardin  <cit> . srf and myocardin play critical roles in the expression and regulation of growth-responsive genes as well as the expression of virtually all smooth muscle specific genes, such as calponin, myosin heavy chain, Î±-actin and sm- <dig>  <cit> . previous analyses of various smooth muscle and general tissues by immunohistochemistry and western blotting have revealed strong expression of smtnl <dig> in mhc-2a skeletal muscle fibers, moderate expression in smooth muscle tissues  and no expression in mhc-i/b cardiac muscle  <cit> . given that smtnl <dig> is expressed in multiple muscle types, it was expected that smtnl <dig> transcriptional regulation might differ from the other smoothelin family members.

to date, the contribution of the smtnl <dig> protein in smooth muscle contraction has been examined in vitro and in vivo  <cit> , but investigations of its gene and transcriptional regulation are still lacking. thus, in this study, we identify and characterize key regulatory elements of the promoter region in the mouse smtnl <dig> gene. this region contains a tss mapped to a location  <dig> bp downstream of the ncbi-predicted site. our data demonstrate that a proximal promoter region is located within  <dig> bp of the tss site and provide molecular insights into the regulation of the smtnl <dig> gene.

RESULTS
pcr analysis of smtnl <dig> transcript
we first examined the pattern of smtnl <dig> expression in skeletal muscle and representative smooth muscle tissues with rt-pcr. as shown in figure 1a, the smtnl <dig> transcript is expressed at very low levels. smtnl <dig> expression in skeletal and aortic smooth muscle tissues was detectable following 35-cycles of amplification; however, transcript was not detected by rt-pcr in other smooth muscle beds. to increase the sensitivity of detection, we then performed nested pcr reactions on the primary products. this step also increased the specificity of the pcr reaction and permitted qualitative verification of smtnl <dig> expression. we detected smtnl <dig> expression by nested pcr in the muscle tissues selected for analysis. the nested-pcr amplicons were sequenced and align 100% to the smtnl <dig> sequence. due to its low abundance, we were unable to accurately assess the expression levels in different tissues with qpcr techniques.

we also investigated the expression of mrna encoding smtnl <dig> transcripts in various human tissues with northern blot analysis. for this study, we used a  <dig> -kb 5'-probe based on mouse smtnl <dig> and moderate stringency washes. the probe was generated to include the sequence encoding the n-terminal  <dig> amino acid residues of smtnl <dig> in order to avoid cross-reactivity with other transcripts that possess sequence encoding a calponin homology -domain, such as the smoothelins. a single transcript of ~ <dig> -kb was detected in skeletal muscle  and correlated with the predicted mrna size of  <dig> -kb. no other mrna species were identified, implying that a single smtnl <dig> transcript exists in skeletal muscle. although we obtained a strong signal for smtnl <dig> mrna in skeletal muscle, northern signals were not detected in tissues with high vascular content such as brain and kidney or in tissues with high smooth muscle content . as seen from our nested-pcr results, a number of smooth muscle tissues do possess smtnl <dig> mrna, but at much lower levels than skeletal muscle which might account for the inability to detect expression by northern blotting. these data agree with protein distributions as determined previously by western blotting  <cit> . interestingly, recent studies have revealed that exercise- and pregnancy-induced alterations in smtnl <dig> expression were linked to functional adaptations in skeletal and smooth muscle contractile performances. given these previous findings, it will be important to generate an accurate tool to quantitatively analyze smtnl <dig> transcript levels in human tissues and/or mouse models of disease.

smtnl <dig> transcription start site mapping
the murine smtnl <dig> gene  is located on chromosome  <dig>  e <dig> and spans  <dig> -kb with  <dig> exons. the mrna sequence  has been annotated using bioinformatic and curatorial analyses in the ncbi refseq database. a thymidine residue at - <dig> bp from the translational start site  within the smtnl <dig> mrna was assigned as the provisional transcriptional start site . this positions the atg at the start of exon  <dig> while exon  <dig>  is not translated. to verify the location of the tss in the smtnl <dig> gene, we performed 5'-race experiments on murine smooth and skeletal total rna. three reverse, gene-specific primers were designed for the pcr step that follows cdna synthesis in the 5'-race process . primer gsp <dig> and gsp  <dig> anneal just downstream of the tss and upstream of the aug . primer gsp <dig> anneals just upstream and outside of the ch domain in exon  <dig> .

the 5'-race pcr on smooth muscle  and skeletal muscle  total rna produced low  molecular weight cross-dimer products between the gsp and 5'-race upm primers . when skeletal muscle mrna was used as template together with primer gsp <dig>  a faint band was visible at approximately  <dig> -kb that was close to the expected product size . to increase specificity and sensitivity, a second round of pcr was performed using nested primers on the products from the 5'-race pcr. the expected amplicon sizes with the ncbi-predicted tss were  <dig> bp for ngsp <dig> and  <dig> bp for ngsp <dig>  a strong band of approximately  <dig> bp was observed for nested pcr reactions completed on both smooth and skeletal muscle gsp <dig> pcr products , somewhat smaller than the expected  <dig> bp product for the ngsp <dig> primer. sequence analysis revealed a partial alignment of the  <dig> bp ngsp <dig> product with smtnl <dig>  starting within exon  <dig> 

the 5' end of the product was  <dig> bp shorter than expected from the ncbi-predicted tss. to further validate the tss identified with 5'-race, ribonuclease protection assays  were performed. a ssrna riboprobe  was generated to span both the ncbi-predicted and 5'-race-derived tss. a protected fragment of  <dig> bp was expected for the ncbi-predicted tss whereas a  <dig> bp fragment was expected for the newly derived tss. as shown in figure 2c, rpa was completed with smooth and skeletal muscle mrna and biotin-18-utp-labeled riboprobe. as expected, the full-length probe was detected near the  <dig> bp marker. a protected fragment slightly larger than  <dig> bp was detected in the rpa with the addition of skeletal muscle mrna. this result further confirms the tss location to be different from that annotated in the ncbi database, occurring less than  <dig> nt upstream of the translational start codon. no protected fragment was detected when yeast rna  or smooth muscle rna was used in the rpa. the latter result was likely due to lack of sensitivity of the rpa conditions for low abundance mrnas.

analysis of the sequence located upstream of the start codon  in murine smtnl <dig> indicated the presence of an initiator  sequence and a tata box . therefore, our experimentally mapped smtnl <dig> tss corresponded to a thymidine within the inr sequence  and was located  <dig> nt upstream of the translational start codon. the putative tata box sequence was identified at - <dig> to - <dig> nt upstream of the new tss. further sequence analysis showed that the inr and tata sequences of smtnl <dig> are conserved within a variety of mammalian smtnl <dig> genes.

the expression profile of smtnl <dig> differs from the other smoothelin  family members that are exclusively expressed in differentiated smooth muscle cells. the smtnl <dig> promoter was expected to be different since the smoothelins are not expressed in any tissue but smooth muscle cells. indeed, the promoter sequences of smoothelins and smtnl <dig> do not bear any resemblance to each other, despite some similarities in the protein-coding region . the smtn-a and smtn-b isoforms of the smtn gene are generated by alternative transcriptional start sites  <cit>  that provide selective expression of each isoform in visceral and vascular smooth muscle beds, respectively. moreover, alternative splicing produces three different c-terminal variants of each smtn isoform  <cit> . it is unlikely that multiple smtnl <dig> isoforms exist since a single smtnl <dig> tss was identified from both skeletal and intestinal smooth muscle total rna with sequencing of several 5'-race clones. all sequences commenced at a thymine located  <dig> nt upstream of the translational start site . however, we have not yet completed 5'-race on smtnl <dig> transcripts isolated from vascular tissue. furthermore, we cannot exclude the presence of multiple c-terminal splice variants since we did not complete 3'-race analysis.

smtnl <dig> promoter reporter assay
to locate cis-elements in the core promoter region that modulate expression of smtnl <dig>  we constructed deletion mutants of the smtnl <dig> upstream sequence and monitored gaussia luciferase reporter activities in rat aortic a7r <dig> smooth muscle cells. promoter sequences were generated spanning up to  <dig> -kb upstream of the newly derived smtnl <dig> tss and cloned into a promoterless pgluc luciferase vector. figure 3a shows the relative luciferase activity using progressively shorter promoter constructs. a  <dig> -fold induction was observed for the upstream region spanning + <dig> to - <dig>  deletion of the region from - <dig> to - <dig> increased the luciferase induction to  <dig> -fold while removal of the sequence from - <dig> to - <dig> elicited no further effect. the minimal sequence establishing the proximal promoter  provided a 7-fold luciferase induction. finally, the first  <dig> bases downstream of the new tss had no activity. these data reveal two regions of promoter sequence that functioned as enhancer elements, - <dig> to - <dig> and  <dig> to - <dig>  furthermore, two inhibitory elements were also defined, - <dig> to - <dig> and - <dig> to - <dig>  these results demonstrate that the first  <dig> bp upstream of the smtnl <dig> tss could significantly enhance luciferase production, suggesting that the core promoter was located in this region. importantly, the region of the core promoter did not include the tss previously annotated in ncbi. our data confirms that the region immediately upstream of the ncbi-annotated tss could not enhance expression, which further verifies our newly identified tss downstream of the ncbi-annotated tss. we further investigated the sequence of the first  <dig> bp upstream of the tss for possible promoter elements. a ttaaa motif,  <dig> nt upstream of the tss, was 100% conserved amongst all the mammalian smtnl <dig> promoters investigated and is predicted to serve as a tata-box. we were unable to identify a caat element.

the promoter region just upstream and including the tss is highly conserved in mammals, emphasizing its importance. the tss of some mammals is not annotated in this region, and this might be due to difficulties in identifying 5'-utrs within the corresponding ests. further corroborating this possibility was the distance between the tss  and the translational start-site  in murine exon  <dig>  in all mammals, this distance was similarly expansive  to  <dig> bp ). we propose that all mammals investigated have a tss located downstream of the conserved region, similar to the murine promoter. this would add an additional 5'-utr exon  <dig> to human, rat and horse smtnl <dig> 

we also investigated whether the pattern of luciferase inductions observed with the smtnl <dig> promoter sequences resulted from a specific set of transcription factors unique to a7r <dig> smooth muscle cells. for this, the activities of three smtnl <dig> promoter constructs were also assessed in hek  <dig>  and rat- <dig>  cell lines . the same pattern of luciferase induction was seen in these cell lines; however, the maximal activation measured was only 3-fold, a significant reduction when compared to the maximal activity found in a7r <dig> smooth muscle cells. the identified cis-acting promoter spanned at least  <dig> bp and could up- or down-regulate expression in a7r <dig>  rat- <dig> and hek  <dig> cells, depending on which region was present. however, the much higher maximum activation in smooth muscle cells compared to fibroblast and kidney cells suggests restrictive control of smtnl <dig> expression in non-muscle cells and emphasizes the importance of smtnl <dig> expression in muscle contractile function.

in silico analysis of putative transcription factor binding sites within smtnl1
a comparison of tss sites in various mammalian smtnl <dig> genes was undertaken, and blast searches revealed that exon  <dig> is not translated and the murine atg start codon is located at the beginning of exon  <dig>  in the case of some mammals , the smtnl <dig> gene starts with the atg in exon  <dig> and is analogous to murine exon  <dig>  further investigation of these smtnl <dig> variants revealed the location of a genomic region that has not been annotated. this region lays several thousand bases upstream with high similarity to the murine exon  <dig>  comparison of various mammalian smtnl <dig> protein sequences revealed the highest conservation at the n- and c-termini . thus, it is not surprising that, based on protein sequence and gene sequence alignment, the exon including the start codon was annotated in all mammals while the upstream exon  <dig> was sometimes not annotated. in agreement with the observation that exon  <dig> is often located far upstream of exon  <dig>  there is approximately  <dig> to  <dig> bp separating the conserved region corresponding to the mouse 5'-utr and the atg start codon of smtnl <dig> from various mammalian species . based on these findings, it is reasonable to predict that the human smtnl <dig> tss lies upstream of the region homolog to murine smtnl <dig> exon  <dig>  even though it remains to be annotated. indeed, the region just upstream of the murine tss is highly conserved in mammals, with > 75% percent identity .

the highest conservation in the murine smtnl <dig> 5'-utr sequence was located between - <dig> bp and - <dig> bp relative to the newly derived tss, suggesting functional importance. indeed, the region corresponds in part to the strongly activating construct determined with the luciferase reporter assay . we searched for transcription factor binding sites  in this region using the patch program that utilizes the transfacÂ® database of cis-acting transcription factors  <cit> . possible mammalian tfbss in this region include ap2Î±, sf- <dig>  rxrÎ±, sp <dig>  er and c-myc amongst others . intriguingly, this region of the smtnl <dig> promoter also possesses a putative tfbs for myod , a transcriptional activator of muscle-specific genes  <cit> , located  <dig> bp upstream of the tss. myod shows highest transcriptional activation when dimerized with another myod or other family members   <cit> . indeed, possible non-canonical sites for myod as well as sp <dig> are located adjacent to the primary myod site in the smtnl <dig> promoter. thus, regulation of smtnl <dig> expression via myod would explain the robust expression found in skeletal muscle when compared to other tissues. we completed emsas with nuclear extracts from mouse skeletal muscle and dna probes derived from the myod site in the smtnl <dig> promoter . gel shifts were suggestive of protein binding to the smtnl <dig> myod sequence and could be inhibited with addition of excess unlabelled probe as a competitive inhibitor. moreover, emsas completed in the presence of myod antibody exhibited a defined "supershifting" band.

the highest density of putative tfbss lay within the sequence gaaggtggggtggggtggaag of smtnl <dig> that forms a  <dig> bp mirror-repeat sequence . mirror repeats are commonly associated with the formation of an intramolecular triple-helical conformation termed h-dna  <cit> . many promoters, especially those integral to genes involved in growth regulation, have h-dna forming mirror repeats. the smtnl <dig> mrs lies within a region of high transcriptional activation as determined by luciferase reporter assay, and it is possible that this region is of paramount importance for smtnl <dig> expression. emsas completed with mrs oligonucleotide probes and nuclear extracts from a7r <dig> cells demonstrated a single intense band . this binding pattern was significantly altered when nuclear extracts from hek <dig> cells were used; in this case, multiple bands were observed. the results are suggestive of transcription factor binding to the mrs; however, more in depth investigation will be required to identify the specific proteins involved.

other transcription factors are of interest based on their function and our knowledge of smtnl <dig>  putative binding sites for the nuclear hormone receptor steroidogenic factor- <dig>  as well as estrogen receptor  are present. these receptors might be responsible for the observed differences in smtnl <dig> expression during sexual development in males  <cit>  as well as during pregnancy in females  <cit> . rxrÎ±  modulates the actions of other hormone receptors and plays a role in myogenesis. rxrÎ± is also responsible for the activation of myod and deficiency in rxrÎ± causes defects in skeletal muscle development  <cit> . furthermore, rxrÎ± is a binding partner for ppar  transcription factors  <cit> . in turn, pparÎ³ regulates endurance-exercise induced fiber type remodeling  <cit> . since endurance-exercise caused up-regulation of smtnl <dig>  rxrÎ± together with pparÎ³ might be the responsible factors. notable is the absence of a consensus cc-a/t rich-gg  box, the binding site for serum response factor  that is present in smooth muscle restricted genes  <cit> . this distinguishes smtnl <dig> from the related smtn genes and is further manifested by the expression of smtnl <dig> in skeletal muscle  <cit> . of the numerous transcription factors predicted to bind to the proximal promoter, several could be responsible for the adaptive expression of smtnl <dig> after endurance-exercise, pregnancy and sexual development in smooth and skeletal muscle. this will be subject to further research.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we identified smtnl <dig> expression in all types of smooth muscle tissue  examined, albeit at lower levels than found in skeletal muscle. current evidence supports a key role for smtnl <dig> in adaptive responses to physiological stresses . therefore, defining key elements of the murine smtnl <dig> gene will enable better understanding of mechanisms for smooth and skeletal muscle contractile plasticity in response to physiological stresses.
