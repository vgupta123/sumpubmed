BACKGROUND
three evolutionarily-conserved dna polymerase enzymes play essential roles at the eukaryotic replication fork  <cit> . dna polymerase α-primase is essential for the initiation of leading strand synthesis at individual replication origins and for the initiation of each okazaki fragment on the discontinuously-synthesised lagging strand. extending from the rna-dna primers laid down by dna polymerase α -primase, recent results indicate that dna polymerase ε  is likely to replicate the bulk of the leading strand  <cit>  while dna polymerase δ  synthesises the bulk of the lagging strand  <cit> , reviewed by  <cit> . in the absence of catalytically-active pol ε, pol δ is apparently able to synthesise both leading and lagging strands  <cit> . completion of lagging strand synthesis requires subsequent processing of the nascent okazaki fragments to remove the rna primer and ligation to form a continuous dna strand  <cit> .

each of the three replicative polymerases α, δ and ε is a member of the b family of dna polymerases  <cit>  and each is a multi-subunit entity, comprising an essential catalytic subunit and a number of smaller subunits, some of which are also essential for cell viability based on the results of genetic analysis in the yeasts  <cit> . until recently, very little high-resolution three-dimensional structural information on the three polymerases was available, as the only solved structures were those of a  <dig> amino acid zinc finger derived from the carboxy-terminal end of the catalytic subunit of human pol α and  <dig> amino acids of the amino-terminal domain of the b-subunit of human pol ε, both determined by nmr  <cit> . a low-resolution structure of the budding yeast pol ε complex was also obtained by cryo-em reconstruction  <cit> . however, high-resolution structures are now available for the complex of p <dig>  and the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids of p <dig>  of human pol δ   <cit>  and for the complex of the c-terminal domain of budding yeast pol <dig> protein, the catalytic subunit of pol α, and the c-terminal pde and ob fold domains of the pol α b-subunit pol <dig>  <cit> .

the fission yeast schizosacchromyces pombe is an excellent model for studying pol δ structure and function  <cit> . in this organism, dna polymerase δ is a heterotetrameric complex, comprising the catalytic subunit pol <dig> and three smaller subunits cdc <dig>  cdc <dig> and cdm <dig>  <cit> . pol <dig>  cdc <dig> and cdc <dig> are essential proteins  <cit>  whereas cdm <dig> is not  <cit> . orthologues of all four subunits make up human pol δ. in contrast, pol δ in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is a three-subunit enzyme; no cdm <dig> orthologue is present in this organism. pol <dig> binds directly to the b-subunit cdc <dig>  <cit>  via one of two conserved zinc finger modules located at the c-terminus of pol <dig>  <cit> . cdc <dig> binds the c-subunit cdc <dig>  <cit>  which interacts directly with two other key components of the replisome – the catalytic subunit of pol α-primase  <cit>  and the sliding clamp processivity factor pcna  <cit> . cdc <dig> has an unusual structure: a globular n-terminal domain of ~ <dig> amino acids is followed by a highly extended c-terminal region of ~ <dig> amino acids  <cit> . the interactions with pol α-primase and pcna both involve short conserved protein-protein interaction motifs located within this c-terminal region, but neither interaction is essential for replisome function  <cit> 

in contrast to pcna and pol α-primase, cdc <dig> binds the n-terminal domain of cdc <dig>  <cit> . the structure of p50•p66n complex  <cit>   now enables the mapping of the interactions within the cdc1cdc <dig> assembly. figure  <dig> provides a summary view of the human p50•p66n complex  together with a schematic representation of the domain structure of the two proteins in humans and yeast . three domains are apparent: p <dig> comprises a phosphodiesterase-like domain  and an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding domain  while p66n comprises a winged helix-turn-helix  domain. the pde domain is located in the centre of the complex with the ob domain on one side and the whth on the other . the pde and ob domains are present in the b-subunits of all three eukaryotic replicative polymerases as well as in the essential second subunit of the archaeal dna polymerase pold  <cit>  found exclusively in the euryarchaeota and thaumarchaeota phyla  <cit> . in the case of the euryarchaeal proteins the pde domain is active as a 3'-5' exonuclease, affording the pold enzyme proofreading activity. key residues required for nuclease activity are absent from the eukaryotic proteins; in the case of pol δ and pol ε, proofreading activity resides in the catalytic subunit of the complex  <cit> .

this study describes the results of mutational analysis of fission yeast cdc <dig>  despite its essential cellular role and widespread evolutionary conservation, the precise biochemical function of the cdc1/p <dig> protein is not known nor is it clear how the structure of the protein is related to this. in fission yeast, a small number of temperature-sensitive mutant alleles of cdc <dig> have been isolated and characterised, and several truncated cdc <dig> proteins tested for function in vivo  <cit> . the temperature-sensitive mutations were shown to result from single nucleotide changes in the gene sequence, resulting in a single amino acid changes in the encoded proteins. these changes mapped towards the c-terminus of the cdc <dig> protein, within the pde domain  <cit> . similar results were seen with budding yeast pol32/hys <dig> mutations  <cit> . analysis of truncated mutant cdc <dig> proteins showed that removal of  <dig> amino acids from the c-terminus of cdc <dig> abolished the in vivo function of the protein, while removal of the first  <dig> amino acids from the n-terminus led to dominant negative cell cycle arrest that could be reversed by simultaneous overproduction of cdc <dig>  suggesting that the mutant cdc1-nΔ2– <dig> protein exerted its function by titrating cdc <dig> from the cell  <cit> .

to investigate further the structure and function of cdc <dig>  a collection of thirty mutant cdc <dig> alleles were generated by directed and random mutagenesis methods. each of the mutations was mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of human p <dig>  <cit>  and each mutant protein was then tested for function in fission yeast cells, and for binding to pol <dig> and cdc <dig> using the two-hybrid system.

RESULTS
pentapeptide insertion mutagenesis
random mutagenesis of the cdc1+ gene was carried out using the pentapeptide scanning mutagenesis  method  <cit> . this method makes use of a modified form of the tn3-related transposon tn <dig> of bacillus thuringiensis. tn <dig> transposes efficiently in e.coli and in doing so duplicates  <dig> bp of host sequence at the insertion point. the transposon also contains kpni restriction sites  <dig> bp from the outer end of its terminal repeats. if, following insertion of tn <dig> into the target gene, the bulk of the transposon is deleted by in vitro kpni restriction and re-ligation, a  <dig> bp sequence insertion remains. since tn <dig> inserts with low sequence specificity, the pentapeptide insertions will vary in composition. the usefulness of this system has been demonstrated through its application for random mutagenesis of, amongst others, tem- <dig> β-lactamase  <cit> , xerd recombinase  <cit>  and phospholipase d <dig>  <cit> .

the strategy for mutagenesis of cdc1+ is outlined in figure  <dig>  plasmid pbr322-cdc <dig>  was transformed into e.coli fh <dig> containing plasmid pht <dig> which carries the tn <dig> transposon  <cit> . individual transformant colonies were then mated with e.coli ds <dig> and resistant colonies identified and plasmids recovered. restriction mapping was then used in order to identify clones in tn <dig> had inserted into cdc1+ rather than the plasmid backbone, and the bulk of the transposon sequences then removed by cleavage with kpni followed by ligation under conditions that promoted self-ligation .

number and distribution of insertion mutations
in total,  <dig> mutant alleles were generated by the psm method . despite their independent origins, dna sequence analysis revealed that these corresponded to only  <dig> different mutant alleles , indicating that insertion of tn <dig> is not entirely random, as noted previously  <cit> . the insertions also clustered towards the 5' end of the cdc1+ gene, with  <dig> of the  <dig> insertions mapping within the first  <dig> bp of the  <dig> bp orf. clustering towards the 5' end of the orf was observed in a similar study of the s.pombe rfc2+ gene cloned into pbr <dig>  <cit> . thirty of the mutant alleles contained a  <dig> nt insertion when compared with the wild-type cdc1+ sequence. the remaining allele  contained a  <dig> nt insertion, presumably the result of an inexact transposition event. this insertion leads to the cdc <dig> protein being truncated after amino acid  <dig>  another insertion also led to production of a truncated protein: cdc1-j <dig> was truncated after amino acid  <dig>  two of the insertions resulted in different insertions at the same amino acid position in the protein .

for the pentapeptide insertion mutants, multiply isolated insertions were as follows: j <dig> , j <dig> , j <dig> , j <dig>  and j <dig> . the location of the insertions is given as the number of the last amino acid residue n-terminal to the insertion. the insertion sequences are shown between the hyphens. note that the target site duplication results in the amino acid immediately n-terminal to the insertion being duplicated as the fifth amino acid of the insertion  and that the insertions in cdc1-j <dig> and cdc1-e <dig> are found at the same amino acid but are of different sequence. quantitative two-hybrid assay values are given as percentages of the interaction seen with wild-type cdc <dig> with pol <dig>  or cdc <dig>  see results for further details.

site-directed mutagenesis
in addition to the random pentapeptide insertion mutations, ten additional cdc <dig> mutations were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis . eight of these alleles resulting in the encoding proteins  differing from the wild-type cdc <dig> by a single amino acid substitution. the remaining two alleles encoded proteins  that featured substitutions of two adjacent amino acids. all the mutated amino acids were amongst those that are found conserved between the eukaryotic dna polymerase b-subunits and the archaeal pold small subunit  <cit> . mutations a <dig> – a <dig> and a <dig>  which combines mutations a <dig> and a <dig>  cluster in conserved region vi  <cit> , whereas mutations a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig>  which combines a <dig> and a <dig>  map to conserved region vii. a <dig> and a <dig> map to conserved regions vii and viii, respectively .

analysis of mutant function in fission yeast
expression in cdc1Δ cells
in order to test for function in s.pombe, each allele was subcloned to plasmid prep3xh6bn to permit expressing of the mutant proteins under the control of the thiamine-repressible nmt <dig> promoter . the resulting plasmids were then transformed into a cdc1+/cdc1::ura4+ h-/h+ diploid strain and diploid transformants isolated at 32°c on supplemented emm plates with and without  <dig> μg/ml thiamine. transformant colonies were then picked and subjected to treatment with helicase to kill vegetative cells and degrade the walls of the asci present in the nutritionally-depleted colony centres. following washing, the spores were plated on supplemented emm media with and without  <dig> μg/ml thiamine and incubated at 32°c for 4– <dig> days .

expression in cdc1-p <dig> cells
in addition to testing the function of the mutant proteins in a cdc1Δ background, each was expressed in wild-type cells and in cells carrying the temperature-sensitive cdc1-p <dig> allele  <cit> . expression of the mutant proteins had no detectable effect on wild-type cells. in cdc1-p <dig> cells, the proteins were tested for their ability to rescue at the restrictive temperature of  <dig> °c in cells grown in the presence and absence of thiamine. the results obtained broadly mirrored those seen with the cdc1Δ strain but with the following exceptions: at low expression levels, several of the mutant proteins that could not rescue cdc1Δ could rescue cdc1-p <dig> at  <dig> °c, namely cdc1-a <dig>  -j <dig>  -j <dig>  -j <dig>  -j <dig>  -j <dig>  -j <dig> and -j <dig>  and two of the mutants, cdc1-a <dig> and -j <dig>  displayed dominant negative properties at 28°c, described further below.

analysis of protein-protein interactions using the two-hybrid system
as described in the introduction, the cdc <dig> protein interacts directly with both the catalytic subunit of the pol δ complex pol <dig> and also with the c-subunit cdc <dig>  these interactions can be conveniently monitored using the yeast two-hybrid system  <cit> . each cdc <dig> mutant allele was therefore cloned into the two-hybrid bait pbtm <dig>  to allow expression of cdc <dig> fused to the dna binding domain of bacterial lexa protein . the resulting plasmids were initially co-transformed into s.cerevisiae cty10-5d along with the prey plasmid pgad2f-cdc <dig>  which expresses cdc <dig> fused to the yeast gal <dig> transcriptional activation domain. co-transformants were monitored for β-galactosidase activity by x-gal overlay assay  and onpg liquid assay .

to examine whether the mutant cdc <dig> proteins interacted with pol <dig>  each pbtm116-cdc <dig> plasmid was transformed into cty10-5d along with the prey plasmid pact-pol <dig> and paa-cdc <dig>  the latter directs expression of cdc <dig> as a c-myc epitope-tagged fusion protein. previously it was shown that interaction between lexa-cdc <dig> and gal4-pol <dig> could only be detected when cdc <dig> was simultaneously co-expressed in the cells  <cit> . presumably cdc <dig> binds to cdc <dig> to stabilise the protein or alter its conformation, allowing interaction with pol <dig> to take place at a level that can be detected under two-hybrid assay conditions. as above, β-galactosidase activity was monitored by x-gal overlay assay  and onpg liquid assay . those mutant cdc <dig> proteins that were unable to bind to cdc <dig> in the two-hybrid system would be predicted to be also incapable of binding pol <dig> 

analysis of dominant negative cdc <dig> mutants
two of the cdc <dig> mutant proteins exerted a strong dominant negative phenotype when expressed at high level in cdc1-p <dig> cells. transformed cdc1-p <dig> cells carrying either prep3xbn-cdc1-j <dig> or -a <dig> were viable at 28°c only when grown on medium containing thiamine to repress the nmt <dig> promoter . when transferred to medium lacking thiamine, high-level expression of the mutant proteins led to cell cycle arrest  and a failure to form colonies. similar behaviour was observed when these mutant proteins were expressed in cdc1– <dig> cells at 28°c, although the phenotype was somewhat weaker .

the two-hybrid analysis described above  suggests that both cdc1-j <dig> and cdc1-a <dig> retain the ability to bind to cdc <dig> but cannot bind pol <dig>  suggesting that the dominant negative phenotype may be the result of the mutant proteins interacting with cdc <dig> to form non-functional cdc1-cdc <dig> dimers, thus titrating cdc <dig> from the cell, impairing pol3-cdc1-cdc <dig>  complex formation and inhibiting chromosome replication. if this were the case, simultaneous overproduction of cdc <dig> would be expected to reverse the toxic effects of cdc1-j <dig> and cdc1-a <dig>  by providing excess cdc <dig> to interact with non-mutant cdc <dig> 

to test this, cdc1-p <dig> cells expressing cdc1-j <dig> and cdc1-a <dig> were co-transformed with plasmid prep4x-cdc <dig> which expresses the full-length cdc <dig> protein, also from the nmt <dig> promoter  <cit> . however, no rescue of the dominant negative phenotype was observed: cdc1-p <dig> cells expressing cdc <dig> and either cdc1-j <dig> and cdc1-a <dig> were still unable to grow on plates lacking thiamine at 28°c. we also tested whether overproduction of pol <dig> or a nuclear-targeted form of the c-terminal znf domain of pol <dig> would rescue the toxic effects of cdc1-j <dig> and cdc1-a <dig>  despite their apparent inability to bind pol <dig> as gauged by two-hybrid assay : again, no rescue was seen. previously, overproduction of an n-terminally truncated form of cdc <dig>  cdc1-nΔ <dig>  has been shown to exert a similar effect on cdc1-p <dig> cells  <cit> . in the case of cdc1-nΔ2– <dig>  however, simultaneous overproduction of cdc <dig> was sufficient to rescue the phenotype. this suggests that the cdc1-j <dig> and -a <dig> proteins exert their effects through a mechanism distinct from that of cdc1-nΔ2– <dig>  perhaps by binding to, and titrating out, an as yet unidentified pol δ interacting factor. screening for high copy suppressors of the cdc1-j <dig> and cdc1-a <dig> dominant negative phenotypes might allow this factor to be identified, although negative regulators of the nmt <dig> promoter are also likely to be identified in such a screen.

discussion
in this report, we describe the results of mutational analysis of the fission yeast cdc <dig> protein using both random and site-directed mutagenesis techniques. in total, thirty mutant proteins were expressed and assayed for function in vivo and for binding to pol <dig> and cdc <dig> by two-hybrid. the results of these assays are summarised in table  <dig> 

for the purposes of the following discussion, we divide the mutations in four separate groups based on the two-hybrid interaction data presented in figure  <dig> and use the structure of the human p <dig> protein  <cit>  as the basis for discussion of possible structural effects of the mutations. in the absence of a crystal structure for the fission yeast cdc <dig> protein, the human p <dig> structure represents the only available option for this type of analysis but it is important to note that the two proteins are only ~35% identical at the primary sequence level and that this could affect some of the conclusions drawn. an additional point to note, particularly when considering mutations that appear to disrupt cdc <dig> function altogether, is that possible effects of individual mutations on protein stability have not been addressed in this study. for technical reasons we have been unable determine the expression levels of the mutants, even in cells cultured in the absence of thiamine. figure  <dig> shows the locations of the mutations in each group mapped onto the structure of human p <dig> according to the protein sequence alignment shown in figure  <dig> 

mutations that disrupt both pol3-cdc <dig> and cdc1-cdc <dig> interactions
the e <dig>  j <dig>  j <dig>  j <dig>  j <dig> and j <dig> mutations disrupt cdc <dig> interactions with both pol <dig> and cdc <dig> in two hybrid-assays ; the locations of the mutated residues on the three-dimensional structure of human p <dig> are shown in figure 6a.

five of the six mutations in this group are pentapeptide insertions . the j <dig> insertion is in the middle of α <dig>  and likely interferes with the folding of this helix, which is an important feature of pde domain. several residues within α <dig> are also involved in cdc <dig> binding, raising the possibility that loss of pol3-cdc <dig> interaction in two-hybrid assays is the caused by disruption of the cdc1-cdc <dig> interaction since pol3-cdc <dig> interactions were only detectable by two-hybrid in yeast cells co-expressing cdc <dig>  in contrast, the j <dig>  j <dig> and j <dig> insertions are located within, and appear likely to disrupt the folding of, the ob domain . the fact that none of the three latter insertions are close to the cdc1-cdc <dig> interface  appears to rule out the possibility that pol3-cdc <dig> two-hybrid interaction is impaired by direct modification of cdc1-cdc <dig> interaction interface. instead, the disruption of ob domain fold by j <dig>  j <dig> and j <dig> insertions is likely to affect the cdc1-cdc <dig> interaction in part by destabilizing the pde domain and in part by preventing the correct positioning of n-terminal residues which are important for the function of cdc <dig>  <cit> . the consequences of the j <dig> and j <dig> mutations for cdc <dig> activity in vivo were more severe than for j <dig> and j <dig>  since neither j <dig> nor j <dig> was able to substitute for loss of cdc <dig> in cdc1Δ cells under any conditions, while j <dig> and j <dig> were able to rescue when overexpressed .

for the remaining two mutations in this group , it is not surprising these the mutant protein fail to interact with both pol <dig> and cdc <dig>  as both mutations result in incorporation of a stop codon into the cdc <dig> sequence and premature termination of translation in the flexible β2α <dig> linker, after amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. when expressed at near wild-type levels in s.pombe, from the repressed nmt <dig> promoter, neither protein is able to support growth of cdc1Δ cells. however, when overexpressed , cdc1Δ cells expressing cdc1-j <dig> were able to grow . this is most likely a consequence of low-level readthrough of the amber  stop codon in the cdc1-j <dig> allele. although e <dig> is also an amber mutation, the sequence insertion in this allele comprised  <dig> nucleotides rather than the usual  <dig>  so that expression of a full-length cdc <dig> protein would require the unlikely combination of readthrough of the aug codon and translational frameshifting.

mutations that disrupt pol3-cdc <dig> interactions only
this group contains a total of thirteen mutations that can be further divided into two sub-groups on the basis of the ability to substitute for wild-type cdc <dig> in cdc1Δ cells. the first sub-group contains six mutations that display either impaired function in vivo  or which cannot rescue cdc1Δ cells under either of the conditions tested. this sub-group comprises the pentapeptide insertions j <dig> and j <dig>  the single point mutations a <dig> and a <dig>  and the double point mutations a <dig> and a <dig> . a <dig> is a combination of a <dig> and a2; a <dig> of a <dig> and a <dig> . five of the six mutations are located in the pde domain and one  in the ob domain. each of the six mutant proteins is able to bind cdc <dig> in two-hybrid  but is greatly impaired in pol <dig> binding ability . strikingly, all six mutations map to the same side of cdc <dig>  identifying a possible pol3-interacting surface. in support of this, glutamine  <dig> in human p <dig>  also maps to this region . a mutation in the corresponding residue in budding yeast pol <dig>  was identified in a screen for dominant extragenic suppressors of the temperature-sensitive pol3– <dig> mutation, in which one of four cysteines of the second c-terminal zinc finger of pol <dig>  is replaced by serine  <cit> . subsequent work showed that the znf <dig> domain was both necessary and sufficient for pol <dig> binding by pol <dig> and that in two-hybrid assays, the k358e mutant of pol <dig> interacted more strongly with both wild-type and mutant forms of znf <dig>  <cit> . taken together, these results suggest that the region defined by these mutations constitutes a pol <dig> binding site on cdc <dig>  this suggestion is consistent with the recent crystal structure of interacting domains of the budding yeast pol <dig> and pol <dig> proteins, the catalytic and b-subunits of pol α respectively  <cit> . the c-terminal domain of pol <dig>  comprising the two zinc fingers znf <dig> and znf <dig> and a three α-helix bundle, makes extensive contacts with the pde and ob fold domains of pol <dig> over a strikingly large area that is equivalent to that defined by our study of cdc1-pol <dig> interactions . intriguingly, the disordered regions d1-d <dig> in the human p <dig> structure  are localised to the same region  <cit> . it is tempting to speculate that these disordered regions also have a part to play in binding pol <dig> and become structured only once pol <dig> is bound.

the second sub-group of mutations unable to bind to pol <dig> comprises mutations j <dig>  j <dig>  j <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig>  these display >20% binding to cdc <dig> in the cdc1-cdc <dig> two hybrid assay but with the exception of a <dig>  display <  <dig> % binding to pol <dig> in the pol3-cdc1-cdc <dig> two hybrid assay . despite their extremely limited ability to bind to pol <dig>  however, these mutant proteins were able to function in vivo, even when expressed at near wild-type levels from the repressed nmt <dig> promoter . the reason for this discordance is unclear but one possibility is that the mutants benefit from the presence of the fourth subunit of the pol δ complex in fission yeast, cdm <dig>  <cit> . in both fission yeast and in mammalian cells, the cdm <dig> protein  appears to have a stabilising effect on the pol δ complex  <cit>  possibly through direct binding to both pol <dig> and cdc <dig>  <cit> . there is no cdm <dig> orthologue in the budding yeast s.cerevisiae, the host for the two-hybrid analysis presented here  <cit> . mapping of the j <dig>  j <dig>  j <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> mutations onto the structure of human p <dig> reveals that j <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  and a <dig> may directly affect the disordered loops , which we propose to form an area of protein-protein interactions. the remaining two mutations, j <dig> and j <dig>  are apart from the suspected interaction area and are likely to exert their influence to pol3-cdc <dig> interactions via an allosteric effect: j <dig> via an n-terminal residues to a disordered region d <dig>  and j <dig> via a loop β8-α <dig> to the disordered region d <dig> 

mutations that disrupt cdc <dig> interactions only
as noted above, in the two-hybrid assay system used here and described previously  <cit> , pol3-cdc <dig> interactions were only detectable when cdc <dig> was co-expressed in the reporter cells. under these conditions, cdc <dig> presumably serves to stabilise or alter the conformation of cdc <dig> to facilitate its binding to pol <dig>  it is therefore surprising that five of the insertion mutant cdc <dig> proteins generated in this study  were able to interact with pol <dig> in the pol3-cdc1-cdc <dig> two-hybrid assay  despite being unable to interact with cdc <dig> in the cdc1-cdc <dig> assay. interestingly, four of these map to the ob domain and the fifth  to the β2α <dig> disordered linker. all five are therefore located some distance away from the cdc1-cdc <dig> interface  making it unlikely that they have a direct effect on cdc <dig> binding. it may be the case that disruption of the ob domain and β2α <dig> linker results in a widespread perturbation of the structure of cdc <dig> and disruption of the cdc1-cdc <dig> interface. when pol <dig> is present , the structure of the cdc <dig> protein, and more specifically the putative pol <dig> binding region described in the preceding section, may be stabilised, effectively insulating the cdc1-cdc <dig> interface from the effects of disruption of the ob domain and β2α <dig> linker. cdc1-cdc <dig> interactions are also impaired by the j <dig> insertion  which maps close to the cdc1-cdc <dig> interface .

mutants unimpaired in pol <dig> or cdc <dig> binding
five mutations fall into this group: the insertions e <dig>  e <dig> and j <dig>  and the single point mutations a <dig> and a <dig>  four of these  map to loop regions in the human p <dig> protein  and probably do not disrupt the secondary structure of cdc <dig>  the e <dig> insertion is on the n-terminus of β <dig>  however, the two amino acids preceding the insertion site  are identical with the residues at the positions  <dig> and  <dig> of the pentapeptide insertion . this has the effect of shifting the insertion from the n-terminal end of β <dig> to the β1β <dig> linker, which likely explains the low impact of this insertion.

CONCLUSIONS
using both site-directed and random mutagenesis strategies, thirty new mutant cdc <dig> proteins have been test for in vivo function and for pol <dig> and cdc <dig> binding using the two-hybrid system. the results obtained can be rationalised in the context of the recently published crystal structure of human p <dig> bound to the n-terminal domain of human p <dig>  <cit>  and, in addition, offer new insights into the potential location of interaction surfaces on cdc <dig> for pol <dig>
