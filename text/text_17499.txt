BACKGROUND
human 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a  reductase  is the rate-limiting enzyme in the isoprenoid/cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. the enzyme converts hmg-coa to mevalonate and is the main target of commonly used lipid-lowering drugs 
 <cit> . some of the major intermediates in the pathway are used to synthesise ubiquinone, dolichol, heme a and isoprenoid lipids
 <cit> . the end-product, cholesterol, is the precursor for the synthesis of crucial compounds, such as steroid hormones, bile acid and vitamin d.

hmgcr is encoded by a single gene on chromosome  <dig> . two transcript variants are annotated in the national center for biotechnology information  reference sequence  database; the canonical full-length transcript composed of  <dig> exons  and an alternatively spliced variant lacking exon  <dig> . additionally, exon junction microarray experiments suggest the presence of at least three more hmgcr splice variants lacking exon  <dig> , exon  <dig>  and exons  <dig> and  <dig> 
 <cit> .

expression of hmgcr is strictly regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. cholesterol homeostasis is maintained by hmgcr transcriptional inhibition and enzyme modifications via negative feedback mechanisms . under sterol-depleted conditions, such as statin treatment, hmgcr transcription is co-ordinately activated with transcription of the low density lipoprotein receptor and other genes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway
 <cit> .

genomic diversity is greatly expanded by the process of alternative splicing, by which introns are removed and exons are ligated together to form various mature mrna transcripts. alternative splicing has been suggested as another mechanism underlying hmgcr regulation and cholesterol homeostasis
 <cit> . an hmgcr splice variant lacking exon  <dig>  was reported to have decreased enzymatic activity and to be less sensitive to statin inhibition
 <cit> . exon  <dig> encodes parts of the catalytic domain and the statin binding site of hmgcr
 <cit> . recently, the major a allele of a single-nucleotide polymorphism  located within intron  <dig> of hmgcr was found to be associated with skipping of exon 13
 <cit> . the relative abundance of hmgcrΔexon <dig> mrna has also been reported to be associated with interindividual variation in statin-mediated lipid-lowering responses
 <cit> . in the present study, nucleotide sequence database queries identified several novel hmgcr splice variants. one of these, hmgcr-1b, shows alternative exon  <dig> usage, with a novel hmgcr n-terminus predicted. we report the mrna levels of novel hmgcr splice variants in a variety of healthy human tissues. furthermore, we present the regulatory responses of these variants in hepg <dig> cells upon statin treatment.

methods
bioinformatic analysis
inspection of displayed mrna, expressed sequence tag  and rna sequencing  tracks at the hmgcr gene locus was performed using the genome browser database provided by the university of california, santa cruz  on human genome assembly grch37/hg19
 <cit> . the other bioinformatic tools used were primer <dig> software
 <cit> , finch tv <dig> . <dig> , dnastar lasergene  <dig>   and the ncbi database of snps.

cell culture and statin treatment
the hepg <dig> cell line  was grown in modified eagle’s minimal essential medium  supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum  and and 1× penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine  mixture  in collagen i-coated tissue culture flasks . cells were seeded at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml in 12-well collagen i-coated plates , and the statin treatment was carried out in triplicate on the following day. hepg <dig> cells were cultivated for 24 hrs in mem with 1× p/s/g containing 3 mg/ml of human lipoprotein deficient serum , with or without 10 μm of -atorvastatin sodium salt  dissolved in water in a total volume of 1 ml. two lymphoblastoid cell lines  were cultured according to the manufacturer’s instructions. sequencing confirmed the cc and aa genotypes of the rs <dig> polymorphism in gm <dig> and gm <dig> cell lines, respectively. statin treatment was carried out as described above, except that 5 ×  <dig> cells/ml of each cell line were seeded into 24-well plates and treated the same day. cell cultures were maintained at 37°c/5% co <dig> 

purification of total rna from cells
total rna from hepg <dig> cells was isolated using an rneasy mini kit  by following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. dnase digestion with an rnase-free dnase set  was used to ensure dna-free rna samples. the rna was eluted in  <dig> μl of rnase/dnase-free water and stored at −80°c until required. rna samples were quantified using a nanodrop nd- <dig> spectrophotometer . rna quality was assessed by microfluidic capillary electrophoresis using an agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer and the rna  <dig> nano chip kit . rna samples were denatured for 2 min at 70°c prior to cdna synthesis.

total rna from human tissues
high-quality pooled rna samples from the human total master panel ii and the human adult normal tissue panel were purchased from clontech  and biocat gmbh , respectively. ten random rna samples were assessed for concentration and integrity as described above. all samples were from anonymous donors and commercially available.

synthesis of cdna
the levels of mrna expression were analysed using total rna from tissues  and cells  in a  <dig> μl cdna synthesis reaction using an omniscript rt kit  and a mixture of  <dig>  μm oligo-dt and  <dig>  μm random hexamers . reverse transcription  was performed at 37°c for 60 min, followed by 95°c for 5 min. the cdna samples were diluted 1: <dig> in rnase/dnase-free water and stored at −20°c prior to use as templates for pcr amplification. a pooled cdna sample was obtained by mixing an aliquot of each of the  <dig> undiluted cdna samples and a 1: <dig> dilution in rnase/dnase-free water.

pcr
polymerase chain reaction  amplification of the different first exons of hmgcr in a cdna pool derived from  <dig> human tissues  was performed with hotstartaq dna polymerase  following the manufacturer’s instructions forward primers  were used in combination with a reverse primer in exon  <dig> . the cycling conditions were 15 min at 95°c, followed by  <dig> cycles of 30 s at 94°c, 30 s at 55°c, 1 min at 72°c and a final extension step at 72°c for 10 min. pcr products were separated on 1–3%  agarose gels. images were captured using a kodak image station 440cf and visualised using kodak molecular imaging software, version  <dig>  . the pcr products of interest were excised and purified using the qiaquick gel extraction kit  and confirmed by sequencing.

molecular cloning
the full-length hmgcr-1b transcript was pcr amplified using a proofstart dna polymerase kit  and a cdna template synthesised from skin . the pcr mix contained 1× proof start buffer, 1× q-solution,  <dig>  u proofstart,  <dig> u hotstartaq plus dna polymerase, 350 mm dntp mix,  <dig> μl of cdna and  <dig>  μm forward primer  and reverse primer  in a total volume of  <dig> μl. the cycling conditions were 5 min at 95°c, followed by  <dig> cycles of 30 s at 94°c, 1 min at 55°c, 3 min at 72°c and a final extension step at 72°c for 30 min. purified pcr products were cloned using the ct-gfp fusion topo ta expression kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. positive clones were confirmed by sequencing.

quantitative pcr 
all qpcrs were performed on an abi 7900ht real-time pcr system in a standard 96-well format. taqman hydrolysis probes  were designed for specific gene quantification of hmgcr-1a, hmgcr-1b and hmgcr-1c. the following taqman primer and probe sets were used: 5′-cca tgc att cga aaa agt ctt gac a-3′ , 5′-ggt tcg gtg gcc tct agt g-3′  and the fam-reporter probe 5′-tcc ttg gat cct cca gat ct-3′ for targeting the hmgcr exon 1a-exon  <dig> boundary; 5′-aat gga tgt cgc aca caa gag a-3′ , 5′-cca tgc att cga aaa agt ctt gac a-3′ , and the fam-reporter probe 5′-ctt gga tcc tgc gtc tct-3′ for targeting the hmgcr exon 1b-exon  <dig> boundary; and 5′-ttt ctg ggc tat act aaa tgt gca tga-3′ , 5′-cca tgc att cga aaa agt ctt gac a-3′  and the fam-reporter probe 5′-aca agg atc caa gga ttc-3′ for targeting the hmgcr exon 1c-exon  <dig> boundary. each qpcr mix comprised  <dig> μl of taqman universal pcr master mix,  <dig> μl of rnase-free water,  <dig> μl of taqman hydrolysis probe and  <dig> μl of cdna. the cycling steps were 10 min at 95°c followed by  <dig> cycles of 95°c for 15 s and 60°c for 1 min. non-template controls were included in each run. all qpcr experiments were performed at least in duplicate. samples exhibiting more than a  <dig>  quantification cycle  difference between the duplicates were excluded from the relative quantification analysis. samples showing cq >  <dig> or undetermined were set to cq =  <dig> and were considered not detectable.

reference gene selection
the stability of  <dig> reference genes from applied biosystems  was checked to confirm the reliability of gene expression results across the tissue samples tested. five  were found by genorm
 <cit>  to give the most suitable normalisation factors for quantification of relative expression levels. for the atorvastatin treatment experiments in hepg <dig> cells, the ppia, tbp, pgk <dig>  actb, gapdh, ubc, ppib, and sdha reference genes were tested. two reference genes, ppia and tbp, were found by genorm to be the most stable and therefore were suitable for normalisation. the mean expression value was used for the normalisation, according to the “ΔΔcq method” for comparing relative expression results between treatments
 <cit> :

  ΔΔcq=2− 

reporter vector construction
different regions of the human hmgcr promoter covering − <dig> to + <dig>  were amplified by pcr. genomic dna from the human variation panels  heterozygous for the hmgcr promoter snp c > a  were used as pcr templates. the pcr primers were: 5′-agc ggt acc gcc att tac act aat ggg taa at-3′  and 5′-agt aag ctt gac caa taa gag agg atc gtt cg-3′  for construction of the reporter vector  <dig> ; 5′-agc ggt acc aat ggg tag gca tat cca agg-3′  and 5′-agt aag ctt ctg cgt ctt ctg tgc gtt c-3′  for construction of reporter vectors  <dig> and  <dig> ; and 5′-agc ggt acc ttg aca agg ctg cta aga gaa ca-3′  for construction of reporter vectors  <dig> and  <dig>  in combination with the same reverse primer used for reporter vectors  <dig> and  <dig>  restriction sites for kpni and hindiii are underlined in the forward and reverse primer sequences, respectively. the pcr was performed using a phusion high-fidelity pcr kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cycling conditions were as follows: 30 s at 98°c, followed by  <dig> cycles of 10 s at 98°c, 30 s at 63°c, 1 min at 72°c and a final extension step of 10 min at 72°c. the pcr-amplified promoter regions were cloned into the kpni and hindiii restriction sites of the promoterless firefly luciferase vector pgl. <dig>  .

transfection and reporter gene assay
hepg <dig> cells were seeded on the day prior to transfection at  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/ml into a 24-well collagen i-coated plate  in  <dig>  ml of culture medium. for each transfection, 485 ng of the firefly luciferase empty control vector  or a test reporter vector was co-transfected with 15 ng of renilla luciferase internal control vector  to normalise for transfection efficiency. transfection was carried out in triplicate using  <dig>  μl of fugene hd  reagent per well. cells were washed with 1 ml 1× phosphate-buffered saline at 24 h post-transfection and then treated with  <dig> μl of passive lysate buffer supplied in the dual-glo luciferase assay kit . after gentle rocking , the lysates were assayed for luciferase activity with the dual-glo luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer’s instructions. firefly luciferase and renilla luciferase activities were measured using the wallac  <dig> victor™ luminometer in a 96-well wallac b&w isoplate™ . delay and measurement times were set to 2 s and 10 s, respectively. the linear range of light detection was determined using a dilution series of quantilum recombinant luciferase . firefly luciferase activity was normalised to renilla luciferase expression. luciferase  activity induction was calculated as fold-change according to the following equation:

  fold−change =mean firefly/renillatest reporter vector/mean firefly/renillaemptycontrol vector 

RESULTS
identification of hmgcr splice variants
bioinformatic analysis and visual inspection of the region between hmgcr exon  <dig> and its adjacent, 5′-flanking gene in the ucsc genome browser indicated at least three alternative first exons, each spliced to the constitutive exon  <dig> . tracks of published rna-seq data indicated transcription of exon 1b, whereas no convincing evidence was found for transcription of exons 1c and 1d. transcription of exons 1b and 1c was confirmed by rt-pcr  of the cdna pool derived from  <dig> different tissues. expression of the predicted exon 1d could not be confirmed by rt-pcr in any of the investigated tissues. the open reading frame of the canonical hmgcr transcript  is maintained in exon 1c, but sequence analysis of exon 1b predicted an additional  <dig> amino acids at the n-terminus. we cloned and sequenced hmgcr-1b  and confirmed that exons 1a and 1b were mutually exclusive. we also found that hmgcr-1b transcripts were subject to exon  <dig> skipping  . exon 1b is potentially translated in certain primates as indicated by alignment of nucleotide sequences from different vertebrate species .

tissue distribution of hmgcr-1a, -1b and -1c
the rt-qpcr experiments showed variable levels of alternative first exons of hmgcr in  <dig> different tissues . the canonical hmgcr-1a transcript was ubiquitously expressed at the highest levels in the cerebellum, fetal brain, testis, skin and adrenal gland . the highest expression of hmgcr-1b was detected in the skin, esophagus, uterine cervix and prostate . hmgcr-1b mrna levels were below detection levels  in six tissues. the level of hmgcr-1a in liver  was approximately two-fold higher than that of hmgcr-1b. we observed higher hmgcr-1a expression in most of the tissues analysed with the exception of the skin, esophagus, uterine cervix and colon, in which the levels of hmgcr-1b were higher . hmgcr-1c was detectable  in only nine of the tissues analysed and was less abundant than hmgcr-1a. the highest expression of hmgcr-1c was detected in the cerebellum, fetal brain, testis and adrenal gland . hmgcr-1c could not be quantified in the skin or uterine cervix , where hmgcr-1b was relatively abundant.

expression analysis before and after atorvastatin treatment in hepg <dig> cells
hepg <dig> cells, a model system for cholesterol biosynthesis studies, were treated with atorvastatin for 24 h. the rt-qpcr experiments showed significant mrna induction  for hmgcr-1a , hmgcr-1b  and hmgcr-1c  in cells after atorvastatin treatment compared with untreated cells. the magnitude of induction was significantly different between hmgcr-1a and hmgcr-1b, and between hmgcr-1b and hmgcr-1c , but not between hmgcr-1a and hmgcr-1c . the hmgcr-1c and hmgcr-1b splice variants were less abundant  in hepg <dig> cells compared with the canonical hmgcr-1a. the fact that exon 1b was found to be approximately two-fold lower than exon 1a in the liver suggests that there are major differences in the expression levels of these transcripts, either between different liver donors or because of cell immortalisation and/or an artificial cell culture environment for the hepg <dig> cells.

hmgcr promoter analysis
bioinformatics showed that exon 1b is located 35 bp upstream of the cpg island in the previously characterised hmgcr promoter. we performed luciferase reporter gene assays in hepg <dig> cells under various conditions to investigate the promoter activity driving the transcription of hmgcr-1b and the genetic influence of the promoter snp rs <dig>  which is close to exon 1b. the promoter region upstream of exon 1a  was active under standard culture conditions with 10% fbs . the exon 1a promoter was further activated under sterol-depleted conditions with lpds  and lpds + atorvastatin  when compared with the activity of transfected cells cultured under standard conditions, containing 10% fbs. the reporter vectors  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  each containing genomic fragments upstream of exon 1b, exhibited low promoter activities that were not induced by sterol depletion , or by higher degrees of sterol depletion . the minor a allele of the promoter snp c > a  did not affect the promoter activity of exon 1b when compared with the major allele c reporter vector. the effect of the promoter snp c > a  on hmgcr exons 1a and 1b mrna levels was investigated after atorvastatin treatment in two different lymphoblastoid cell lines homozygous for either allele. the rt-qpcr experiments  showed similar induction of hmgcr-1b mrna levels after atorvastatin treatment in both lymphoblastoid cell lines, independent of the allelic status. hmgcr-1b was induced  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold in cells with the major cc and the minor aa genotype of rs <dig>  respectively. the magnitude of induction was not significantly different between the two different cell lines. the canonical hmgcr-1a transcript was upregulated  <dig>  ±  <dig> -fold in both lymphoblastoid cell lines after atorvastatin treatment.

discussion
hmgcr is the key enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and is the major target of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs. here, we demonstrate the existence of alternative exon  <dig> usage in human hmgcr, resulting in several novel transcript variants. one of these, hmgcr-1b, encodes a novel n-terminus which potentially extends the membrane domain by  <dig> amino acids compared with the canonical sequence. the canonical hmgcr protein is composed of  <dig> amino acids with a regulatory, sterol-sensing transmembrane domain , a flexible linker  and a c-terminal catalytic region 
 <cit> . we studied hmgcr-1b at the genomic and transcriptional levels. whether the translation machinery actually recognises the first aug as a start codon to produce a protein with  <dig> additional amino acids in the membrane domain remains to be determined. unfortunately, initial experiments using rabbit antibodies raised against the novel n-terminus of the predicted hmgcr-1b polypeptide exhibited non-specific binding .

in mammalian genomes, only one gene encodes the hmgcr enzyme, which mainly resides in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum
 <cit> . a minor fraction  of the reductase activity has been demonstrated in rat liver
 <cit>  and mouse brain
 <cit>  to be localised in the matrix of peroxisomes. the signal that targets hmgcr to peroxisomes has not yet been determined. the hmgcr-1b transcript identified in this study is remarkably less abundant than the canonical hmgcr-1a in most of the tissues analysed, and it is tempting to speculate that exon 1b might encode the missing hmgcr peroxisomal targeting information
 <cit> . however, bioinformatic analysis of the n-terminus of the hypothetical hmgcr-1b protein did not reveal any peroxisomal targeting signals .

our finding that hmgcr generates multiple 5′ end transcripts is not unusual in the human genome
 <cit> . there are numerous other examples in the literature. the gene locus encoding the uridine diphosphate–glucuronosyltransferase  <dig> family contains several different coding first exons, which generate at least nine different transcripts encoding various isozymes with unique n-termini and substrate specificities
 <cit> . another example is the cyp19a <dig> gene encoding aromatase, the rate-limiting enzyme of estrogen biosynthesis, which contains alternative non-coding first exons affecting rna stability and aromatase levels in tissues. differential use of non-coding first exons is suggested to be an important mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation of aromatase gene expression
 <cit> .

whether an alternatively spliced variant is functional is considered in the context of tissue-specific expression and conservation in most studies
 <cit> . the mrna levels for the alternative hmgcr-1b splice variant were more abundant than the canonical hmgcr-1a levels in epithelial tissues, such as skin. skin is one of the major sites for cholesterol production in the body
 <cit> , where hmgcr activity and cholesterol synthesis are crucial for hindering fluid loss from the body by maintaining the permeability barrier
 <cit> . in addition, the production of non-cholesterol isoprenoid intermediates by hmgcr has been reported to be important during acute wound healing
 <cit> . sequence alignment of hmgcr-1b did not show conservation of the open reading frame in all terrestrial animals. therefore, it remains to be determined whether the hmgcr-1b splice variant exerts an epithelial or skin-specific role in sustaining the epithelial barrier function in certain primates.

tissue-specific gene expression may be regulated via differential gene promoter activity
 <cit> . the weak promoter activity of the genomic region upstream of exon 1b is in accordance with the rather low, basal mrna expression level of exon 1b found in hepg <dig> cells. unexpectedly, the alternative promoter activity in the reporter assay was not induced by sterol depletion, although there was an increase in the hmgcr-1b mrna level in hepg <dig> cells. based on these results, the increased hmgcr-1b mrna level due to sterol depletion in hepg <dig> cells most likely results from post-transcriptional regulation and/or regulatory promoter dna sequences not captured in our reporter vector constructs. moreover, previous studies have identified a functional c > a snp  in the hmgcr promoter
 <cit> . keller et al. identified a sterol regulatory element  in this position. they found that the minor a allele was more responsive to the overexpression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein  <dig>  compared with the major c allele
 <cit> . in our experiments, this promoter snp, which is close to the transcription start of exon 1b, did not contribute significantly to the proximal promoter activity or mrna level of hmgcr-1b or to the transcription of the canonical hmgcr-1a variant upon sterol depletion.

approximately half of human genes are predicted to have alternative promoters
 <cit> . a comparative study of different promoter features in human and mouse genes reported a distinct class of “non-conserved” promoters in humans
 <cit> . alternative promoters differ from the major promoter in their responsiveness to a specific condition, resulting in different expression levels in tissues or developmental stages and thereby increasing the flexibility of gene expression. given that the putative hmgcr-1b promoter identified in our study  exhibits a different response to statin treatment compared with the canonical hmgcr promoter,  is of minor usage,  is lacking cpg islands, and  that the hmgcr-1b transcript shows an expression pattern distinct from that of hmgcr-1a, it seems likely that the hmgcr-1b promoter represents an alternative, non-conserved hmgcr promoter that contributes to the expressional diversity of this gene.

with respect to hmgcr-1a, we also found that exon  <dig>  which encodes amino acids in the catalytic region, is a cassette exon in the hmgcr-1b transcript, meaning that this exon is either included  or skipped . the catalytically active hmgcr is formed as a tetramer with two dimers
 <cit> . medina et al. have proposed that the inactive hmgcr lacking exon  <dig> modulates the hmgcr enzyme activity by being part of the catalytically active tetramer and thereby reducing its total enzyme activity
 <cit> . further studies are needed to clarify whether the delta-exon  <dig> variant of the hmgcr-1b transcript also contributes to hmgcr enzyme activity modulation and statin response.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that human hmgcr uses different first exons to produce multiple alternatively spliced variants, thereby contributing to increased transcriptional complexity. we have designated these splice variants hmgcr-1a, hmgcr-1b and hmgcr-1c. the novel hmgcr exon  <dig>  we identified contains an in-frame atg translational start codon predicting an extended n-terminus of hmgcr. moreover, we showed that this transcript variant is differentially expressed in a wide variety of healthy human tissues, and that its mrna levels are regulated upon statin treatment. further studies are needed to elucidate potential physiological roles of differential first exon usage in hmgcr.
